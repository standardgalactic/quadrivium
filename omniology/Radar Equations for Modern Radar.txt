Preface 
 
The starting point for analysis of radar performance is the radar range equation, 
which gives the maximum range at which a specified signal-to-noise ratio, re-
quired for successful detection of a target, can be obtained. The physical princi-
ples behind what is usually called simply the radar equation have been known 
since the work performed during World War II and reported in the unclassified 
post-war paper by Norton and Omberg.1 Subsequent books on radar systems, 
starting with Ridenour’s Radar System Engineering in 1947, have included chap-
ters in which the equation is derived and expressed in different ways, with terms 
characterizing the radar, the target, the detection requirements, and the environ-
ment in which the radar operates. The complexity of environmental effects leads 
most of these discussions to presentation of an equation giving the range in an 
environment where thermal noise is the only source of interference competing 
with the target echo, and where the path between the radar and the target is char-
acterized by a range-dependent atmospheric attenuation factor. 
The most thorough discussion of the radar equation appeared in Blake’s Ra-
dar Range-Performance Analysis, based on work by that author at the Naval Re-
search Laboratory between 1940 and 1972, and published in 1980. That book is of 
lasting value and remains in print after more than thirty years. The reader is urged 
to obtain and read it.  
The objective of this new volume is to extend Blake’s classic work to ensure 
applicability of radar equations to design and analysis of modern radars, to identi-

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
fy what information on the radar and its environment is needed to predict detec-
tion range, and to provide equations and data to improve the accuracy of range 
calculations. The chapter outline follows generally that of Blake’s book so that the 
reader can better appreciate his contributions while identifying extensions that are 
useful in application to modern radars. Special attention is directed to propagation 
effects, methods of range calculation in environments that include clutter and 
jamming in addition to thermal noise, and to establishing the many loss factors 
that reduce radar performance.  
There are two conflicting approaches to deriving a radar equation. Following 
the Naval Research Laboratory work of World War II and Blake’s elegant exten-
sions, we adopt here the first approach. In addition to the standard geometrical 
relationships for a wave spreading as it moves through space, it uses the concept 
of the matched filter, in which the ratio of input signal energy to noise spectral 
density, during the observation time on the target, is used to calculate the maxi-
mum possible output signal-to-noise (power) ratio SNR that would be obtained in 
an ideal (lossless) system. The input signal energy is proportional to the average 
power of the transmission, regardless of its waveform. A succession of loss factors 
is applied to find the output SNR for the practical radar being considered, as a 
function of the target range. The detection range is then the range at which that 
SNR meets the requirement for a stated probability of detection, given a required 
false-alarm probability. That requirement is identified as the detectability factor, 
and it depends on details of the practical signal processing method used in the 
radar.  
Following the first approach, the efficiency of the radar can be compared to 
that of an “ideal” system in terms of the total of losses that have been introduced 
the practical implementation. Inspection of the loss budget may suggest improve-
ments in design or modeling, but performance beyond that of the ideal system is 
clearly ruled out. 
The alternative approach calculates the output SNR of a single pulse at the re-
ceiver output as a power ratio, dependent on such parameters as receiver band-
width, peak power of the transmission, and many other factors in design of the 
practical radar. In most cases that SNR is inadequate for reliable detection, and a 
succession of processing gains is applied to bring it to the required level at some 
calculated detection range. That evaluation, if correctly performed, would give the 
same range as the first approach. 
The hazard in the second approach is that no theoretical limit to performance 
is established as a check on how much processing gain is theoretically available. 
The receiver bandwidth and processing gains in a modern radar, using complex 
pulse-compression waveforms, mixtures of coherent and noncoherent integration, 
and digital processing, are difficult to define. Too many cases have occurred in 
which the calculated performance exceeds that available from a matched-filter 
system, as cascaded gains are applied incorrectly to the analysis. 

 
Preface

Blake’s work was motivated by the requirement that Naval Research Labora-
tory perform accurate evaluations of competing contractor proposals for new na-
val radar designs. It provided a means of comparing systems when detailed infor-
mation was omitted or described in a way that protected “proprietary technology.” 
The Blake Chart, discussed here in Chapter 1, became the gold standard for clari-
fying issues of radar range performance. Open publications of the work allowed 
radar professionals to obtain reproducible results on a wide variety of radar system 
designs. 
What is surprising is that subsequently published radar texts fail to take ad-
vantage of this work. Blake contributed the chapter on the radar equation to the 
1970 and 1990 editions of Skolnik’s Radar Handbook, but to this day other texts 
continue to use radar equations in which a “receiver bandwidth B” appears in the 
denominator of the equation to give receiver “noise power” that is proportional to 
that bandwidth. The radar novice might conclude that as B  0 the SNR  , 
although disabling the receiver does not improve its detection performance. 
Transmission of a pulse-compression waveform having B = 100 MHz yields a 
noise bandwidth Bn = 100 MHz for the matched pulse-compression filter, accord-
ing to the accepted definition of that term given in Chapter 6 of this book. A large 
“pulse-compression gain” must be included somewhere in the equation if that 
bandwidth is used in the denominator. Similar confusion applies when digital 
Doppler filtering is used with a coherent pulse train, or when multiple pulses are 
integrated after envelope detection. 
Experience shows that a radar range equation containing receiver bandwidth 
B has a high probability of causing serious errors, which can be avoided using 
Blake’s approach.  
Another source of error is using noise figure F and a standard temperature 
T0 = 290K in the denominator of the radar equation. When the product N = kT0FB 
is used for noise power, the result is pessimistic for radars that look into a cold 
sky. An alternative form appearing in a least one recent text substitutes the expres-
sion N = kT0(F  1)B, which predicts that N  0 as F  1. This leads to optimis-
tic results for any radar operating in an environment with temperature above 
273 Celsius. Blake addresses this problem in a way that achieves accurate re-
sults for any environment, as discussed here in Chapter 6. 
Blake’s inclusion of the pattern-propagation factors Ft and Fr in the radar 
equation addresses a host of problems that complicate range calculation. Omission 
of that factor from presentation of the equation, even when propagation effects are 
discussed elsewhere in a text, invites error. 
Given that Blake uses the approach in his papers and textbook that avoids 
these errors, what justifies a new book on the subject?  
First, equations for detection in environments in which clutter and jamming 
add to thermal noise are discussed only briefly by Blake. More detailed treatment 
is needed, especially in the case of clutter, which cannot be modeled by a Gaussi-

xviii 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
an probability density function and a uniform spectral density. This subject is cov-
ered here in Chapters 3 and 9. 
Second, use of diversity (in time, frequency, space, or polarization) is an im-
portant method of minimizing the energy required for detection probabilities 
greater than 50%. This subject is explored in detail in Chapter 4. That chapter 
presents methods not discussed by Blake or the collaborator in his text by which 
the detectability factor can be calculated on personal computers for different radar 
and target models that provide measures of diversity to reduce the detectability 
factor. 
Third, new radar technology such as active phased arrays presents problems 
in analysis that were not anticipated in Blake’s work. For example, the multifunc-
tion array radar (MFAR) must often economize on scan time by minimizing over-
lap in beam positions. The optimization of beam spacing during scanning of a 
volume requires a compromise between scan time and total energy expended  to 
achieve the required detection probability. This subject is explored in Chapter 5. 
Fourth, much of Blake’s material involves a mixture of metric and “U.S. cus-
tomary units” such as nautical miles and kilofeet. We have found that consistent 
use of metric units in radar performance analysis avoids introducing errors in con-
versions to and from other systems. When presenting results to U.S. Navy or Air 
Force personnel or others unaccustomed to using metric units, a simple conversion 
after completion of the analysis provides the modified data with minimal oppor-
tunity for error.  
Lastly, this writer hopes that Blake’s legacy to the profession will not be 
compromised by calling attention to an inconsistency in use of his bandwidth cor-
rection factor Cb as a factor multiplying the detectability factor in the denominator 
of the radar equation (see Section 1.3). That factor, as defined and plotted by 
Blake, is unity for an optimum product of bandwidth and pulsewidth Bn  1.2, 
and hence is applicable only to multiply the visibility factor of a cathode-ray-tube 
display. If it is applied to multiply the detectability factor for electronic detection, 
the result is optimistic by  2 dB, an error which is inconsistent with the accuracy 
desired and available from the rest of Blake’s approach. 
What accuracy should be expected of range calculations using the radar equa-
tion? Blake discusses this issue at the end of his chapter on pulse-radar detection-
range computation without arriving at numerical estimates. Marcum, in his classic 
work on detection theory,2 warned of pitfalls in range calculation: 
The number of pitfalls that may be encountered in the use of the [radar] equation are almost 
without limit, and many of these difficulties have been recognized in the past 
He goes on to mention three of the most troublesome as evaluation of the tar-
get cross section, the minimum discernible signal power, and the statistical nature 
of detection range as a function of detection probability. To his list we must add

the uncertainty in target location relative to points of maximum radar system re-
sponse in four-dimensional radar space, and the presence of other than thermal 
noise in the environment. 
Even in cases where only thermal noise is present, the accuracy can seldom 
be better than about three decibels in required and achieved energy ratio (equiva-
lent to about 20% in free-space range). In a clutter environment, reduced accuracy 
is inevitable, and the resulting error in range, even for 3-dB error in signal-to-
clutter ratio, may exceed 20%. 
It remains useful to perform calculations to precisions of a fraction of one 
decibel. This permits alternative designs to be compared with greater precision, 
and loss budgets to be evaluated as a guide to improved designs. With careful 
modeling, it is unnecessary to add several decibels of error to that caused by un-
certainties in the environment or the performance of radar operating and mainte-
nance personnel. When radar performance in field tests fails to measure up to 
specifications and predictions, it is common to attribute the difference to a “field 
service loss” or “operator loss” of several decibels, when in fact the performance 
was never designed into the radar system.  
This book is intended to provide methods by which the errors in predicting 
radar range performance can be minimized, even though they cannot be avoided 
completely. 
The author would like to express his thanks to Dr. Paul Hamilton for his re-
view of the manuscript during its generation, and to many colleagues, especially 
Harold Ward and William Shrader, whose advice over many years has been essen-
tial to understanding the factors that affect radar detection range. Lamont Blake 
was one of those colleagues, and his insights will continue to guide the future ef-
forts of the radar community.

CHAPTER 1 
Development of the Radar Equation 
The radar range equation was developed during World War II to permit analysis 
of radar system performance and to guide radar developers in choosing among the 
limited design options available in that era. The earliest literature on the subject 
was subject to military security restrictions but was published after the end of the 
war and has been widely distributed. 
The basic approach to predicting radar detection range has remained con-
sistent with the early work, summarized in the first published paper on the radar 
equation: the 1947 paper by Norton and Omberg of the U.S. Naval Research La-
boratory [1, 2]. We will refer to that equation as the original radar equation. In 
this chapter we review the steps by which the radar equation was developed, and 
discuss its evolution to forms that can be applied to analysis and design of modern 
radar systems. To avoid confusion from varied symbols used by different authors, 
we replace those used in the referenced works with a consistent system of sym-
bols, defined as they occur and listed in Appendix A at the end of this book. This 
permits direct comparison of the equations and their limitations and applicability 
to current problems. 
1.1 
RADAR EQUATION FUNDAMENTALS  
The objective of the radar equation is to calculate the maximum range Rm at which 
the desired detection performance can be achieved for a specified set of radar, 
target, and environmental parameters. The radar equation discussed in this chapter 
is limited to an environment in which thermal noise is the only source of interfer-
ence against which a target echo signal must successfully compete to be detected. 
Equations for other environments are developed in Chapter 3.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The radar range equation is derived in three steps: 
1. Express the maximum signal-to-noise ratio that is available with giv-
en parameters, as a function of range; 
2. Express the minimum signal-to-noise ratio that is required to meet 
detection requirements; 
3. Combine these expressions to solve for the maximum range at which 
the requirement is met for the specified radar. 
1.1.1 
Maximum Available Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
It was determined in classified work by North during World War II [3], subse-
quently reprinted in Proceedings of the IEEE, that the maximum possible signal-
to-noise power ratio (S/N)max is obtained when the receiving system uses the 
matched filter for the transmitted waveform. This maximum ratio is equal to the 
energy ratio E/N0 of the waveform,1 where E is the energy of the echo signal and 
N0 is the spectral density of competing thermal noise. The expression to be devel-
oped in step 1 gives E/N0 for the specified system parameters. In [1], E/N0 is de-
fined as the available energy ratio of a single pulse, referred to the output port of 
the receiving antenna. That reference point is used throughout this book. 
The energy density Ep of the outgoing pulse, measured at an arbitrary range R 
from an isotropic transmitting antenna, is

where Et (joules) is the energy of the transmitted pulse and 4R2 is the area of a 
sphere of radius R centered on the radar. For an assumed rectangular pulse of 
width  (s) and peak power Pt (W), Et = Pt (J). For a transmitting antenna with 
gain Gt, the energy density on the axis of the beam is increased by that gain:

ferred to a receiver connected directly to the antenna output port, is expressed as

power ratio:

1.1.2 
Minimum Required Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
The second expression used in derivation of the radar equation gives the energy 
ratio required to obtain the specified detection performance. It is assumed in [1] 
that detection is performed by a human operator observing a cathode-ray-tube 
display that presents n successive echo pulses: 
 

min
0
E
V n
N

 
(1.10) 
where Emin is the minimum energy of each received pulse that renders the n-pulse 
group visible on the display under optimum viewing conditions. This is consistent 
with the current definition [4]: 
visibility factor (pulsed radar) The ratio of single-pulse signal energy to noise power per 
unit bandwidth that provides stated probabilities of detection and false alarm on a display, 
measured in the intermediate-frequency portion of the receiver under conditions of optimum 
bandwidth and viewing environment. 
The minimum required energy is thus 
 



min
0
   J
s
E
N V n
kT V n


(1.11) 
The number of pulses n is given by the product of the pulse repetition fre-
quency fr and the observation time to, which is the lesser of the dwell time of the 
radar beam on the target or the time constant of the display and human observer: 
 
r o
n
f t

 
(1.12) 
Thus the required energy ratio can be reduced by integration of successive pulses 
obtained with broad beams or slow scanning of the radar across the target posi-
tion. 
Experimental values for V(n) with an optimum A-scope2 were reported in [5]. 
These and similar results for the PPI displays3 are presented in [6–12]. For radar 
systems in which electronic detection replaces visual detection, the visibility fac-
tor is replaced by a detectability factor D(n), defined [4]: 
                                                           
2 The A-scope displays receiver output voltage vs. range. 
3  The PPI displays receiver voltage as intensity on a polar plot of range vs. azimuth angle. 

 
Development of the Radar Equation

In pulsed radar, the ratio of single-pulse signal energy to noise power per unit bandwidth that 
provides stated probability of detection for a given false alarm, probability, measured in the 
intermediate-frequency amplifier bandwidth and using an intermediate-frequency filter 
matched to the single pulse and followed by optimum video integration. 
Subscripts are sometimes added to V and D to denote the target model and the 
detection probability to which they apply (e.g., V0(50), denoting the energy ratio 
required for 50% probability of detection on a steady (Case 0) target [6–12]). In 
general, V exceeds D as a result of the lower efficiency of the visual detection 
process, as discussed in Section 4.6. 
1.1.3 
Maximum Detection Range for Pulsed Radar 
Setting the available E/N0 in (1.9) equal to the required value V or D, the equation 
for maximum range of a pulsed radar is obtained:

(1.14) 
These equations are only the starting point for prediction of radar detection range. 
They give the range along the axis of a common transmitting-receiving antenna 
beam at which the received energy ratio is adequate under free-space conditions, 
when using an optimum filter (for visual detection) or a matched filter (for elec-
tronic detection). 
1.2 The Original Radar Equation 
The range equation derived by Norton and Omberg [1] is expressed by (1.13), 
with the following understandings: 
 Noise Spectral Density. The noise power spectral density calculated as 
 



  W/Hz

kTF

 
(1.15) 
for a system at a “room temperature” T = 300K with receiver noise figure Fn.  
 Visibility Factor. The visibility factor is derived for a pulse “barely visible” 
on an A-scope display [5], and is defined to include the effects of 

6 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
nonoptimum bandwidth rather than using separate values of an ideal visibility 
factor, as defined in [4], and a bandwidth correction factor, introduced in [6–
12]. 
 Propagation Effects. The authors in [1] discuss the effects of tropospheric ab-
sorption and refraction and reflections from the surface underlying the radar-
target path, but these are not included as terms in the original radar equation. 
 RF Losses. Transmitting and receiving line losses Lt and Lr are included in a 
final equation in [1] based on (1.13). That form of the equation, complicated 
by several numerical conversion constants, is no longer useful. 
A numerical conversion factor is introduced in [1] to present the resulting 
range in miles. Other numerical factors are introduced by substitution for the con-
stants 4, k, and T, and by inclusion of approximations for visibility factor and 
target cross section, such that the final expression is encumbered by a numerical 
constant that obscures the basic relationships used in derivation. This was done to 
combine as many factors as possible into a single numerical value in an era when 
calculations were made by slide rule or electromechanical calculators. That is no 
longer necessary or desirable. In order to expose the relationships and permit 
comparison of different forms of the radar equation, we retain in subsequent dis-
cussion the terms used in derivation, without conversion factors or introduction of 
numerical values. 
In spite of these limitations, the original radar equation, formulated during 
World War II, remains relevant today in that it uses the signal-to-noise energy 
ratio to capture the fundamental relationships between detection range for a free-
space path and parameters of the radar and target. The insight of the originators of 
this equation, in relying on North’s matched-filter relationship and using energy 
ratios as the criterion for successful detection, deserves the recognition accorded 
by Blake and overlooked in  much of the current literature. 
1.3 
BLAKE’S RADAR EQUATION FOR PULSED RADAR 
Lamont V. Blake at the Naval Research Laboratory [6–13] builds on the World 
War II work, while introducing more precise definitions of terms in the radar 
equation. His basic radar range equation for pulsed radar takes the form [12, p. 19, 
Eq. (1.34)]:

The numerator of (1.16) has dimension J-m4, when the terms are expressed in 
fundamental units. The new terms added to (1.14) are: 

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
7 
Ft = 
pattern-propagation factor for the transmitting path; 
Fr = 
pattern-propagation factor for the receiving path (see Chapter 8). 
The denominator of (1.16) has dimension J, where the new terms are: 
Ts

system input temperature in kelvins (see Chapter 6); 
D(n) = 
detectability factor (defined in Section 1.1.2; see Chapter 4); 
Cb 
= 
bandwidth correction factor (see Section 10.2.3); 
L 
= 
L1L2 = system loss factor. 
The system loss L is expressed by the product of two components: L1, the RF loss 
in (1.7) that reduces the available energy ratio, and L2, the signal processing loss 
that increases the required energy ratio relative to D(n). 
1.3.1 
Significance of Terms in Blake’s Equation 
The terms in Blake’s radar equation are defined to provide accurate results for 
pulsed radars with or without intrapulse modulation, using noncoherent integra-
tion, and operating in the natural environment. Attention should be paid to follow-
ing factors.  
 Transmitter Energy. The use of pulse energy Pt allows (1.16) to be applied 
directly to radars using pulse compression waveforms for which the time-
bandwidth product B >> 1, where B is the width of the transmitted pulse 
spectrum. This contrasts with equations in which Pt is used without  in the 
numerator, and a competing noise power N0B appears in the denominator. 
Such equations are inapplicable to transmissions with intrapulse modulation.  
 Pattern-Propagation Factors. Blake introduces directly into the radar equa-
tion the factors Ft and Fr that account for the elevation pattern of the antenna 
and the effects of surface reflections, both functions of elevation angle and 
essentially invariant with range. The pattern-propagation factor is defined 
[14, p. 35] as 
the ratio of the amplitude of the electric field at a given point under specified conditions to 
the amplitude of the electric field under free-space conditions with the beam of the trans-
mitter directed toward the point in question. 
 As used in (1.16), this factor is understood to exclude the effects of the azi-
muth antenna pattern and attenuation of the medium, both of which Blake in-
cludes as components of L. The F factors include the antenna gains at the tar-
get elevation relative to those on the axes at which Gt and Gr are defined, the 
contribution of surface reflections to the radiated and received fields, and 
modification of the fields by diffraction on low-elevation paths. For array an-
tennas, they include also the reduced gain from off-broadside operation, cal-
culation of which is discussed in Chapter 10.  

8 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
 Noise Temperature. Blake introduces the system noise temperature Ts to ex-
press the effects of both internal and external noise sources, replacing the 
product TFn in (1.15). This change is especially important when the receiver 
noise figure is small and the antenna beam points into the cold sky. It should 
be noted that Ts is referred to the output terminal of the receiving antenna, 
and includes the effects of thermal noise output from the antenna and receiv-
ing line loss Lr between the antenna and the receiver, as well as that from the 
receiver itself. 
 Use of Energy Ratios. Blake continues the use of energy ratios for the availa-
ble and required signals, as in the original radar equation.  
 Detectability Factor. The detection process can be either electronic or visual, 
but any departure from the ideal process that is assumed in deriving the de-
tectability factor requires inclusion of an appropriate component in the loss 
factor L2.  
 Bandwidth Factor. The factor Cb, is given by [12, Eq. (8.14a)] as

where Bn is the noise bandwidth of the receiver. This factor is equal to unity 
for an “optimum” receiver noise bandwidth Bn = 1.2/. Its origin and use are 
discussed in Section 10.3.3, and the error arising from use of Cb in radars with 
electronic detection is discussed in Section 1.5.4. 
 Loss Factor. The system loss factor L, appearing in (1.16), is the product of 
the following factors:  
Lt, transmission line loss in the path connecting the transmitter output to the 
antenna terminal at which Gt is measured;  
L, atmospheric absorption loss for the two-way path;  
Lp, beamshape loss4 for a scanning radar [13]; 
Lx, miscellaneous signal processing loss that represents the product of other 
receiving and signal processing losses not specifically included in Ts, Cb, Lp, or L.  
Of these losses, Lt and L contribute to the RF loss L1 that decreases available 
on-axis energy ratio, while Lp and Lx contribute to the loss L2 that increases re-
quired energy ratio. The treatment of loss factors and the fact that some are func-
tions of the required detection probability are discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 
10. 
                                                           
4  Blake refers to this as “antenna pattern loss,” but beamshape loss is the original and currently ac-
cepted term. This loss is discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

1.3.2 
Methods of Solving for Range 
Because of the complicated range-dependence of the terms Ft, Fr, and L, there is 
no closed-form solution for Rm using (1.16). Blake discusses iterative and graph-
ical methods for solution [12, pp. 379–388]. One simple method is embedded in 
the “Pulse-Radar Range-Calculation Worksheet,” commonly known as the Blake 
chart, shown in Figure 1.1. This chart is used to solve the equation by addition 
and subtraction of decibel values, easily performed with pocket calculators. 
The antenna height above the surrounding surface and the target elevation an-
gle are entered in the Blake chart for record, because the result is only valid for 
those specific conditions. The user then enters five parameters in part (1), using 
them to calculate the system noise temperature Ts. The terms listed as coming 
from figures and tables are discussed in Chapter 6, where the applicable figures 
are presented along with equations to replace conversion tables. Remaining range 
factors are entered in part (2) of the chart, converted to decibel form in part (3), 
and summed to find the decibel value 40logR0(nmi). The free-space range R0 in 
nautical miles is found as the antilogarithm. The pattern-propagation factor F is 
calculated separately (see Chapter 8), and multiplies R0 to obtain an initial range 
estimate R. That estimate is input to a two-stage iteration to correct for atmos-
pheric attenuation. Additional iteration steps may be required when the attenua-
tion coefficient of the atmosphere at the target is large, as in some millimeter-
wave radar cases or in microwave radar when precipitation is present. 
A complication in the Blake chart is the use of mixed units for entry of range 
factors. These include the radar frequency fMHz = (c/)/106 rather than  that ap-
pears in the radar equation. The resulting range-equation constant collects the sev-
eral conversion factors, constants, and their dimensions as:

Note that a median radar cross section 50 and a corresponding visibility fac-
tor V0(50) are entered into the Blake chart, to arrive at the range R50 for a probabil-
ity of detection Pd = 50%. The radar cross section normally specified is its average 
value, which for a fluctuating target characterized as Swerling Case 1 (see Section 
4.3.3) is 1.5 dB greater than the median.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
 
Figure 1.1  Blake’s Pulse-Radar Range-Calculation Worksheet [8]. The referenced figures are repro-
duced in Chapters 4, 6 and 7, and the referenced tables for conversions between decibels and ratios 
are now replaced by digital calculation. 

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
11 
Plots of V0(50) and corresponding D0(50) for electronic detection are presented 
in [6–8], but calculations for values of Pd other than 50% are often needed. 
Blake’s subsequent presentations in [9–12] provide plots of D for different values 
of Pd and for several target models. These plots require use of the average (rather 
than the median) value of  in (1.16) and in the Blake chart. 
1.3.3 
Advantages of the Blake Chart 
A major advantage of the Blake chart is that it records the input values on which 
the range calculation is based, along with several intermediate results. In the ab-
sence of this discipline, essential data may be left unrecorded and unavailable for 
later reference. When engineering calculators or digital computer methods are 
used to replace Blake’s conversion tables and manual intermediate steps, the pro-
cess is rapid and accurate. The exact form of the chart has undergone successive 
modifications from Blake’s original in [6] to its final form in [12], but the basic 
approach remains. A modification of the chart that maintains entries in fundamen-
tal units is described in Section 1.4.2.  
The Blake chart formalizes the iteration that solves for the effects of range-
dependent attenuation. It has been widely accepted as a standard range-calculation 
method, although parameters would preferably be entered in fundamental units. 
Procedures for conversions between decibels and ratios no longer require recourse 
to associated tables because they are performed readily on pocket calculators or 
computers. Preservation of the basic format of the chart remains an important el-
ement in providing traceability of results. There are all too many opportunities for 
error when the entire process is reduced to entry of parameters into a computer 
program and reading an output representing detection range, without recording 
and inspection of inputs and intermediate results.

Blake’s Coherent Radar Equation

(1.18) 
Here the energy Pavtf  of the observed waveform replaces the single-pulse transmit-
ted energy Pt = Pavtr, where Pav is average power, tf  is the coherent processing 
interval (CPI), and tr is the pulse repetition interval (PRI). The required energy 
ratio D(1) for detection is the value for the single output of the coherent integrator. 
The result is a general radar equation (similar to that of Hall, discussed in Section 

12 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
1.4.1), applicable to continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed Doppler radars as well as 
to noncoherent pulsed radars. 
The application of the Blake chart to coherent radar requires merely the re-
placement of Pt with average power Pav in kW, and  with tf in s. If those units 
are inconvenient for CW radars, they may be replaced by watts and milliseconds 
without changing the range-equation constant.  
Equation (1.18) is based on the assumption that detection is performed using 
the output of a Doppler filter without subsequent noncoherent integration. This 
limitation can be avoided, and the equation applied to radars using noncoherent 
integration of n filter outputs, by replacing D(1) with D(n). The increase in avail-
able energy, relative to (1.16), is expressed by the ratio Pavtf /Pt > 1 in the nu-
merator, and the decrease in required single-sample energy relative to (1.18) 
through the ratio D(n)/D(1) < 1 in the denominator. The coherent and 
noncoherent gains from all n pulses are thereby included in the range calculation.  
Blake’s radar equation, promulgated also through the first two editions of 
Skolnik’s Radar Handbook [15, 16], yields an accurate prediction of the maxi-
mum detection range for a target at any elevation angle, using realistic models of 
radars with any types of waveform and processing under actual environmental 
conditions. The steps required to modify his equations for modern radar problems 
are relatively minor, and are discussed in Section 1.6. 
1.3.5 
Blake’s Bistatic Range Equation 
Blake extends his basic radar equation to bistatic systems [12, Eq. (1.38)]:

where Rt and Rr are the transmitter-to-target and target-to-receiver paths, respec-
tively. The quantity (RtRr)1/2 is the geometric mean of the two paths in the bistatic 
system. The comments of Section 1.3.1 apply equally to this equation.  
The Blake chart can also be used with bistatic radar, yielding the geometric 
mean range. Separate calculations of the pattern-propagation factors Ft and Fr are 
needed to arrive at the two-way factor F = (FtFr)1/2 in line 8 of the chart. The it-
eration procedures for attenuation in lines 9–14 are carried out using the sums of 
one-way attenuations over the two paths, considering their elevation angles 
(which should be recorded separately at the top of the chart along with the two 
antenna heights). 
Blake’s equations and chart are intended primarily for use in cases where tar-
gets are detected within the unambiguous range of the radar waveform. The re-
sults will be correct for detections beyond the unambiguous range, but errors may

arise from eclipsing by the transmission (see Section 1.6.1 and 10.1.2) or loss of 
integration caused by use of varying PRIs.

OTHER FORMS OF THE RADAR EQUATION 
1.4.1 
Hall’s Radar Equations 
Hall presents in [17] a radar equation for pulsed radar, preceding Blake’s work, 
and clarifying many of the issues in previous literature:

This is equivalent to (1.14) with the following substitutions: 
 The gain G 2 for a common transmitting/receiving antenna replaces GtGr; 
 F4 is included in the numerator as the two-way pattern-propagation factor; 
 System temperature T0Fn is used for a receiver connected directly to the out-
put terminal of an antenna in an environment at standard temperature T0 = 
290K; 
 The product 1.2Dx(n)LtL, replaces DL, where Dx(n) is the effective detecta-
bility factor given by the product of the following five terms: 
D(n) = 
basic (theoretical) detectability factor for noncoherent integra-
tion of n pulses; 
Lm 
= 
loss for nonoptimum bandwidth; 
Lp 
= 
beamshape loss; 
Lc 
= 
collapsing loss; 
Lo 
= 
operator and degradation factor. 
The factor Dx is used in the equation for modern radars (see Section 1.6). The fac-
tor 1.2 that multiplies Dx in (1.20) represents the matching loss for an optimum 
receiver bandwidth Bn = 1.2/, assuming an unmodulated pulse. Additional loss 
related to nonoptimum IF bandwidth is captured in the loss Lm. 
A subsequent presentation by Hall of a general radar equation is applicable to 
monostatic and bistatic radars systems that use any waveform [18, Eq. (8)]:

This expression combines Blake’s (1.18) and (1.19), with the following substitu-
tions: 
 The coherent integration time tf is assumed equal to the observation time to; 
 The product of detectability factor and loss D(1)L is replaced by Dx(1)LtLr.  
 The product of one-way atmospheric attenuations Lt and Lr for the transmit-
ting and receiving paths is used in the denominator. 
Accurate results are available from Blake’s widely promulgated method, so Hall’s 
expressions have received little attention. They are included here to illustrate ap-
propriate use of the energy ratio in radar equations. 
1.4.2 
Barton’s Radar Equations 
The initial radar equation used in the 1964 Radar System Analysis [19] used peak 
transmitter power and noise power in the receiver bandwidth rather than energies. 
This lapse was corrected in the 1988 Modern Radar System Analysis [20] where 
radar equations are based on Blake’s and Hall’s work, the latter having introduced 
the effective detectability factor Dx(n) in place of the basic factor D(n) and its as-
sociated losses. Barton’s equation for pulsed radar is [20, Eq. (1.2.25)]:

The RF loss L1 that reduces available energy ratio are stated as separate terms Lt 
and L. The loss L2 that increases the required energy ratio is included in Dx, and 
is defined to avoid error caused by use Blake’s factor Cb in connection with elec-
tronic detection. Alternate forms of the equation are given for two types of coher-
ent radar: 
 Coherent integration over entire observation time [20, Eq. (1.2.26)], where 
energy Pavto in the observation time replaces single-pulse energy Pt, and sin-
gle-sample Dx(1) replaces Dx(n); 
 Coherent integration over CPI, followed by noncoherent integration over to 
[20, Eq. (1.2.27)], where energy Pavtf in the CPI replaces single-pulse energy 
Pt, and Dx(n) is replaced by Dx(n), where n = to/tf.

The second alternate form is used as the basis for a modified Blake chart, an ex-
ample of which is shown in Figure 1.2.

the multiple conversion factors of the original chart. The range-equation constant 
now includes only the factors (4)3, k, and a factor converting range in m to km:

The procedures for entry, intermediate calculations, conversion to and from deci-

original Blake chart. Blake’s Cb is replaced by the matching factor M, defined in 
Section 10.2.3. 
The 2005 Radar System Analysis and Modeling gives the most general form 
of the radar equation as [21, Eq. (1.20)]:

This is the form used for the modified Blake chart of Figure 1.2, but with an added 
factor Fp
2 to account for possible polarization mismatch between transmitting and 
receiving antennas. That factor, normally set to unity, is included to emphasize the 
need to consider that the polarization of the receiving antenna may not match that 
applicable to the echo as calculated using the transmitted polarization and the 
normally specified target cross section  in the radar equation. For example, when 
right-hand circular polarization is used both for transmission and reception, the 
usually specified  gives the echo of the left-hand circular polarization component 
to which the receiving antenna is insensitive (see Section 10.1.1). 
1.5 
AVOIDING PITFALLS IN RANGE CALCULATION 
It is appropriate here to comment on the different forms of the radar equation pre-
sented above and elsewhere in the literature, and to point out sources of error in-
volved in their use. 
1.5.1 
System Noise Temperature Ts 
The product kTFn in the original equation (1.9) was intended to represent the noise 
spectral density N0 at the receiver input. Blake carefully defines his corresponding 
product kTs and its several components to improve the accuracy of noise calcula-

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
17 
tions [12, p. 152]. His approach is especially important in modern systems where 
the noise figure is low and the antenna is directed toward the cold sky. His expres-
sions are discussed in Chapter 6, with examples showing significant errors in re-
sults of the radar equation when the temperature of the environment that surrounds 
the radar is simply assumed to be T0 = 290K.  
Blake’s formulation should be adopted as a permanent substitute for less me-
ticulous expressions for thermal noise in any radar equation. This practice has 
been followed in the first two editions of Skolnik’s Radar Handbook [15, 16] and 
in Barton [20–22]. Other presentations of the radar equation mistakenly rely on a 
simplified relationship N0 = kT0Fn, which is adequate only for radars in which 
Fn >10 dB. For modern radars it fails to model accurately the noise spectral densi-
ty, with resulting errors in the order of 1–2 dB in calculation of the minimum re-
quired signal energy. 
1.5.2 
Use of Signal-to-Noise Energy Ratio 
Both the original equation and those of Blake and Hall are properly based on rati-
os of input signal energy to noise spectral density, rather than of input power to 
noise power in some ill-defined (and generally unmeasureable) bandwidth. This 
allows the use of North’s fundamental matched-filter relationship for the maxi-
mum available signal-to-noise ratio [3]: 
 
max
0
S
E
N
N




(1.24) 
where E is signal energy and N0 the noise spectral density at the filter input. This 
gives the upper limit to potential radar performance, and can be applied to a radar 
using any waveform by applying a matching factor for cases in which the actual 
receiver and processor fall below the performance of the matched filter. The re-
quired input energy ratio is increased by this matching factor. 
Radar equations using transmitter power Pt in the numerator and receiver 
bandwidth Bn or some “effective receiver bandwidth” in the denominator almost 
inevitably lead to errors, and are inapplicable when pulse compression or frequen-
cy-modulated CW signals are transmitted. Even with unmodulated pulses, when 
Bn < 1/, the small value of Bn in the denominator of the equation leads to an erro-
neously large Rm, approaching infinity for Bn  0 (which corresponds to an inop-
erative receiver). With Bn >> 1/, the resulting Rm may be too small because 
smaller video (or display) bandwidth reduces the noise relative to that passed by 
the receiver. 
Surveying the radar literature, many authors place the noise power for receiv-
er bandwidth Bn in the denominator of the radar equation. In cases where the pulse 

18 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
energy does appear in the numerator, the derivation is often based on the assump-
tion that an unmodulated pulse with Bn = 1 is used.  
1.5.3 
Use of Average Power 
Radar equations that include average rather than peak transmitter power, such as 
(1.18), (1.21), or (1.23), are to be preferred because they emphasize the depend-
ence of radar detection range in the thermal noise environment on average power, 
rather than on peak power or other waveform parameters. Those parameters are of 
practical importance for reasons other than establishing detection range. Use of 
peak power is not necessarily erroneous, as long as the contributions and losses 
from approximately matched filtering and integration, both coherent and 
noncoherent, are properly expressed for the waveform and processing actually 
used by the radar. Such expressions become increasingly difficult in modern ra-
dars, where system bandwidth is not a measureable parameter. 
1.5.4 
Bandwidth Correction and Matching Factors 
An error arises when Cb expressed by (1.17) is applied in the equation for radars 
using electronic detection. The value Cb = 1.0 for Bn = 1.2 falsely implies that 
such an “optimum filter” is a matched filter. The original radar equation was de-
rived for radars with detection performed visually on a cathode-ray-tube display. 
The value of V, as determined experimentally, includes losses of 2–3 dB inherent 
in the display/observer process even when the “optimum bandwidth” is used 
[19, p. 171]. The detectability factor D used in (1.14) or (1.16) is defined for sys-
tems in which a matched filter is used, and hence requires use of a matching factor 
M, differing from Cb, to express any filter mismatch effects. This issue is dis-
cussed further in Sections 4.6 and 10.3. 
1.5.5 
Detectability Factors for Arbitrary Targets 
Exact equations for detectability factors of commonly used target models are giv-
en in the literature and in Chapter 4. An expression for the single-pulse, steady 
target (Case 0) value denoted by D0(1), as derived by Rice [23], is readily solved 
using mathematical programs that run rapidly on personal computers. Marcum 
[24] extends the theory to D0(n) for radars using noncoherent integration of multi-
ple pulses. Swerling [25] gives expressions for detectability factors applicable to 
target models denoted by Cases 1–4 with amplitude statistics corresponding to 
chi-square distributions with two or four degrees of freedom and with slow or fast 
fluctuations of amplitude, denoted in this book by D1(n)...D4(n). These exact ex-
pressions are supplemented in [21] by a generalized model leading to a factor 
De(n, ne) for targets whose statistics follow the chi-square distribution with 2ne 

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
19 
degrees of freedom. The generalized model covers Cases 0–4 and also targets for 
which the number of independent target samples is 1  ne  n, including 
noninteger values commonly encountered. 
Chapter 4 presents both exact and approximate methods of calculating detect-
ability factors for all these models. Errors of several decibels can result from use 
of an inappropriate target model, as is likely for targets described by Swerling 
models when the radar system takes advantage of diversity in time, frequency, 
space, or polarization. 
1.5.6 
Pattern-Propagation Factor 
Inclusion of pattern-propagation factors Ft and Fr, or their geometric mean F, in 
the numerator of the radar equation is essential for accurate range calculation in 
any case where the target is not on the elevation beam axis and the elevation 
mainlobe is not clear of the surface underlying the radar-target path. Most texts 
contain some reference to the need for these factors, often discussing them sepa-
rately from the radar equation, rather than embedding the factors in the equation. 
The treatment of this factor for phased array radars observing off-broadside tar-
gets requires special attention (see Section 10.2.1). 
1.5.7 
Loss Factors 
The beamshape loss Lp is listed as one component of the loss factor L included in 
(1.16) and (1.18). This assumes that the target is not on the axis of the radar beam 
during the entire integration time of the echo pulses (e.g., when the radar scans 
across the target position). It is shown in Chapter 5 that Lp is a function of the re-
quired detection probability Pd unless several pulses, distributed across the 
mainlobe of the antenna pattern, are integrated as the beam scans.  
Another issue that requires careful consideration is the relationship between 
beamshape loss and the antenna pattern embedded in the pattern-propagation fac-
tor F. Blake’s method applies Lp to the effect of azimuth scan of a conventional 2-
D search radar, while allowing F 4 to describe the effect of the target position in 
the elevation pattern. For two-dimensional scan, F = 1 can be used along with a 
loss Lp
2 for regions where there are no surface-reflection effects and where the 
average performance over an elevation sector is to be evaluated. This issue will be 
discussed in Chapter 8. 
In phased array radars, the gain at the beam axis varies with off-broadside 
scan angle. The gains Gt and Gr are normally defined on the beam axis at broad-
side, and the off-broadside scanning factor is included in the pattern-propagation 
F, which is then a function of both elevation and azimuth. Alternatively, an aver-
age scan loss over the sector may be defined (see Section 10.2.1) to account for 
the gain variation over the scan. As with beamshape loss, the scan sector loss in-

20 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
creases the energy ratio required at broadside by an amount that depends on the 
specified Pd, unless the energy transmitted in each beam dwell is adjusted as a 
function of scan angle to compensate for the reduced gain of the off-broadside 
beams (see Section 10.2.1). 
The miscellaneous loss Lx in the equations is intended to include a number of 
loss factors, discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Several of these loss factors are also 
functions of the required Pd, and hence must be varied along with the detectability 
factor D if accurate range results are to be obtained. 
1.5.8 
Summary of Pitfalls in Range Calculation 
Common errors in using the radar equation include the following: 
 Use of T0 = 290K rather than the actual system noise temperature Ts. 
 Use of signal-to-noise power ratio in an ill-defined bandwidth B, instead of 
energy ratio. Any radar equation that includes a receiver bandwidth B will 
cause confusion, at best, and at worst will cause serious errors in the range 
calculation. 
 Use of peak power without including the corresponding processing factors 
and losses. 
 Use of the bandwidth correction factor Cb with other than the visibility factor 
V that includes the losses from visual detection. 
 Use of a visibility factor or detectability factor that fails to account for statis-
tics of the actual target and radar diversity. 
 Failure to include the appropriate pattern-propagation factor. 
 Failure to account for all the actual losses. 
1.6 
RADAR EQUATION FOR MODERN RADAR SYSTEMS 
1.6.1 
Factors Requiring Modifications to the Range Equation 
Developments in radar technology and countermeasures to radar have imposed 
new problems in applying the radar range equation. Most of these problems can be 
solved by including an appropriate range-dependent response factor Frdr in the 
numerator of the radar equation. The factor Frdr includes several components as 
described below. The factors become especially important with low-observable 
targets, whose reduced cross sections may prevent detection beyond the range at 
which eclipsing and STC take effect. 

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
21 
1.6.1.1 Eclipsing  
Eclipsing of the received signal occurs with two classes of waveform: (1) low-
PRF radars using solid-state transmitters with duty cycles in excess of  1%; and 
(2) medium- and high-PRF radars.5 
 Solid-State Transmitters. Solid-state RF power amplifiers cannot provide high 
peak powers in exchange for low duty cycle6, as is the case for power tubes. 
Hence, the design of solid-state transmitters tends toward higher duty cycles, 
typically Du = 5% to 20%, in order to obtain the required average power 
while staying within the low peak rating of the devices. For low-PRF radar 
the pulse repetition interval tr must be long enough to avoid range ambiguity, 
and higher Du requires longer pulses than commonly used in tube transmit-
ters. For example, an unambiguous range of 450 km requires tr  3 ms. For 
Du = 20% the resulting transmitted pulsewidth   600 s. Echoes from tar-
gets at range R < Rmin = c/2  90 km, are eclipsed: the early portions of the 
echo overlap the transmission, causing loss in signal-to-noise ratio. Echoes 
from R > Ru  Rmin, where Ru = c/2fr, also suffer eclipsing of the far end of 
the echo. The radar equation for such cases includes a range-dependent 
eclipsing factor Fecl as a component of Frdr. 
Some solid-state radars use dual-pulse groups in which each long pulse is ac-
companied by a shorter pulse, offset in frequency from the long pulse, to cov-
er the short-range region eclipsed by the long pulse. In this case, only the av-
erage power of the longer pulse contributes to the detection of long-range tar-
gets, and the radar equation should reflect this. Eclipsing at the far end of the 
unambiguous range region is not avoided by using the short-range pulses. 
The eclipsing factor for a radar that cannot detect a low-observable target be-
yond Rmin may prevent detection within that range. 
 MPRF and HPRF waveforms have long been used in airborne radars, and ap-
pear also in some types of surface-based radar. Implicit in these waveforms is 
the requirement to detect targets with R > Ru. Calculation of maximum detec-
tion range then requires introduction of the eclipsing factor in the radar equa-
tion. The factor at a particular PRF is a deterministic function of range. When 
multiple PRFs are used in each beam position (either within the beam dwell 
or from scan to scan) the factor is usually represented statistically (see Sec-
tion 10.2.1). 
                                                           
5  The desired targets for low-PRF waveforms are within the unambiguous range; for high-PRF wave-
forms they are within the unambiguous velocity; for medium-PRF waveforms they are beyond both 
unambiguous range and velocity. 
6  Duty cycle (or duty factor) is the ratio of the pulse duration to the pulse repetition interval.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
1.6.1.2 Sensitivity Time Control (STC) 
Many low-PRF radars use STC to avoid saturation of the receiver or processor on 
large targets or clutter at medium and short range, and to suppress undesired de-
tections of small moving objects such as birds and vehicle traffic at those ranges. 
STC is applied to reduce receive sensitivity at delays within some STC range Rstc, 
which is chosen to establish a threshold target cross section min above which tar-
gets are to be detected. Attenuation is applied at RF prior to the receiver, or in the 
early stages of the receiver, to restrict the amplitude level of expected echo inputs. 
The effect of the range-dependent STC factor Fstc is illustrated below in Figure 
1.5. A radar with STC loses the ability to detect, even at short range, a low-
observable target whose cross section is less than min. 
1.6.1.3 Beam Dwell Factor 
Radars may in some cases move the beam so rapidly that the receiving beam axis 
does not remain near the angle at which the transmitted pulse illuminates a long-
range target, and from which the echo arrives after a delay td < tr.  
 If continuous scan occurs at a rate  such that the angular change  = tr 
between pulses is significant but less than the beamwidth in the scanned co-
ordinate, a beam-dwell factor is introduced that depends on range. If  is 
greater than the beamwidth, the echo signal is lost. 
 Radars with electronic scan usually scan in steps such that the beam dwells at 
the position used for transmission until the echo from the most distant ex-
pected target has arrived. In some cases, the receiving beam may return to the 
angle of a target that was illuminated by a prior pulse whose echo is sought, 
but that mode of operation is unusual, and the time available for the return 
dwell among other radar functions is limited. 
In either case, the scanning radar discriminates against signals arriving with 
delay exceeding the dwell time of the beam in the direction of transmission, and a 
beam dwell factor Fbd is included as a component of Frdr in the radar equation to 
describe this effect. 
1.6.1.4 Frequency Agility or Diversity 
Pulse-to-pulse change in frequency (agility) or group-to-group change (diversity) 
is used to evade jamming and to average the observed target RCS (e.g., for reduc-
tion in fluctuation loss). In either technique the receiver frequency is changed to 
that of the immediately preceding transmitted pulse. The beneficial effect on RCS 
averaging is included in the target model used to calculate the detectability factor 
De(n, ne). Discrimination against echo signals arriving after the frequency change 

 
Development of the Radar Equation 
23 
requires inclusion of a frequency diversity factor Ffd as a component of Frdr in the 
radar equation. 
1.6.1.5 Lens Factor 
The lens loss introduced by Weil [26] is caused by the change in tropospheric 
refraction with elevation angle. Although discussed by Blake [12, pp. 188–192], it 
is sometimes overlooked omitted because it does not appear as a specific term in 
the radar equation. To avoid this, the two-way lens factor Flens2 is included here as 
a component of Frdr. It must not be lumped with the atmospheric attenuation L in 
the denominator of the equation because it is not a dissipative loss that increases 
the system noise temperature. 
1.6.2 
Equations Applicable to Modern Radars 
Modern Radar System Analysis Software, Version 3.0 [22] is a comprehensive set 
of worksheets (to be referred to as MRSAS3, and loosely termed a program), that 
runs under the Mathcad program to calculate radar detection range and meas-
urement accuracy. This version of program was developed during a period in 
which changes in radar technology and increased concern over reduction of target 
cross section exposed limitations in earlier forms of the radar equation, as dis-
cussed in Section 1.6.1. The program was designed to provide a more thorough 
analysis of radar performance, in which (1.23) was modified by addition of the 
range-dependent response factor Frdr for voltage response of the system, whose 
square modifies the available energy as a function of range:

These five factors are discussed in detail in Chapters 7 and 10, and for the present 
the following brief descriptions will suffice.  
 Eclipsing Factor. Eclipsing has long been recognized as an important factor 
in high- and medium-PRF airborne radar, where the duty cycle exceeds that 

24 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
commonly found in low-PRF systems. With the advent of high-duty-cycle, 
solid-state radar transmitters in surface-based radar, eclipsing becomes a 
more general problem. The resulting factor Fecl is discussed in Section 10.1.2. 
 STC Factor. STC applies a variable voltage gain Fstc  1 at RF prior to the re-
ceiver or in the early stages of the receiver (see Section 10.1.2). It is assumed 
here that significant competing noise is introduced in receiver stages subse-
quent to the STC, so that the output signal-to-noise ratio varies as the square 
of Fstc, compared to its value with constant gain. 
 Beam-Dwell Factor. The beam-dwell factor Fbd is normally unity, but de-
creases when beam motion reduces the antenna gain on the target between the 
time the signal is transmitted and when the echo is received (see Section 
10.1.2).  
 Frequency Diversity Factor. The frequency diversity factor Ffd is unity as 
long as the receiver remains tuned to the frequency of the echo arriving at the 
radar. It is included here to ensure that echoes from ambiguous ranges are ex-
cluded, as dictated by use of frequency diversity or agility.  
 Lens Factor. Weil showed that this factor reduces the available energy for 
targets near the horizon at long range, where the beam is spread in elevation 
by tropospheric refraction (see Section 7.4). Because it is not a dissipative 
loss that increases the antenna temperature, as does the atmospheric absorp-
tion loss L, it is best expressed as a factor separate from absorption.  
The resulting radar equation [22, Eq. (7.67)] is rewritten here to include the 
new range-dependent response factor:

Method of Calculating Detection Range 
A simple iteration procedure is used in the Blake chart to solve for detection range 
in the presence of range-dependent atmospheric attenuation. The introduction of 
the additional range-dependent response factors and the possible change in signal 
processing mode with range require a more robust method. This is based on the 
fundamental approach described in Section 1.1: the available and required energy 
ratios are found as functions of range, and the maximum range is found for which 
the two ratios are equal. The process can be graphical [21, Section 1.6], or imple-
mented by computer [22]. Graphs generated as intermediate results in [22] illus-
trate that procedure and the effects of range-dependent terms on both available 
and required energy ratios.

Table 1.1 lists the parameters of a noncoherent 2-D low-altitude surveillance radar 
to be used as an example. The available and required energy ratios E/N0 and Dx for 
Pd = 50% are shown in Figure 1.3, for a 1.0-m2 target flying inbound at a constant 
1 elevation, using Modern Radar System Analysis Software [22]. The program 
makes calculations at 100 equal inward steps in range, from a user-selected max-
imum (150 km in this case). To find Rm, values of E/N0 and Dx (in decibels) are 
inspected until their difference is positive. Interpolation is applied to find the exact

range (Rm = 132 km, in this case) for which E/N0 = Dx. The example radar is mod-
eled as using MTI processing out to a range Rp = 50 km, but the increase in Dx 
caused by MTI loss within that range does not affect Rm as long as Rp < Rp. < Ru. 
(where in this case Ru = 135 km). 
1.6.3.2  Example for Solid-State Radar 
A possible solid-state version of the example radar is modeled, having the same 
average power and unambiguous range but a duty cycle of 20%, giving a pulse 
width  = 180 s. Eclipsing occurs for R < 27 km, and for 108 km < R < 162 km, 
giving the effect as shown by the available energy ratio plotted in Figure 1.4. De-
tection now occurs at Rm = 114 km, where almost full pulse compression gain 
becomes available as the incoming target emerges from the eclipsed region. 
Eclipsing at short range has no effect on Rm in this case. 
1.6.3.3 Example for Radar with STC 
Figure 1.5 shows the result of applying STC within the first half of the unambigu-
ous range of the example radar. The upper curve shows the desired effect for a 
target cross section  = 1m2, where the available energy is maintained well above 
the requirement for all R < Rm. The solid curve is plotted for a smaller target 
( = 0.032m2 = 15 dBsm), showing that such a target fails to reach the require-
ment for Pd = 50% at any range. This performance would be desirable in an air 
traffic control radar, for example, where the desired targets have   1m2 and

1.6.4 
Vertical Coverage Charts 
The result of a Blake chart or other solution to the radar range equation gives one 
point in the vertical-plane coverage of a surveillance radar, for which the pattern-
propagation factor F(t) is valid, where t is the specific target elevation used in 
calculation. Because the range R in the Blake chart is directly proportional to F, a 
simple method of constructing the plot is to calculate F() as a function of varying 
elevation angle , and express the detection range envelope as R(). This would 
be adequate if there were no significant change in the atmospheric attenuation 
over the elevation beamwidth, but otherwise the iterative procedure for calculation 
of attenuation would have to be repeated at several elevation angles over the sec-
tor to be plotted. The procedure used in [22] calculates the available energy ratio 
using F, L, and Lrdr as functions of range for each plotted elevation, using small 
enough steps to produce smooth coverage curves. Calculation of the required en-
ergy ratio Dx as a function of range, caused by factors such as beamshape, MTI 
losses, and STC, also provides results not readily obtained in using the Blake 
chart. Coverage for the example radar is shown in Figure 1.6. 
The chart shown in Figure 1.6 was calculated for the radar of Table 1.1 oper-
ating over a land surface with rms height deviation h = 3m, generating only one 
significant reflection lobe that lies below 0.1 elevation. This lobe would extend 
beyond the unambiguous range Ru = 135 km, except that the increased Dx in that 
region exceeds the available energy ratio, truncating the coverage to Ru. The same 
increased Dx, caused by use of MTI processing for R < Rp = 50 km, causes a slight 
lump in the curves at the top of the beam, where they pass through that range. At

the center of the beam,  = 1, the curve for Pd = 50% agrees with the detection 
range shown in Figure 1.3. 
Range calculations at a single elevation are useful for many purposes, but 
they fail to convey the information shown in the vertical coverage chart. That 
chart provides, in visually interpretable form, data necessary for evaluation of 
surveillance radar performance. On the other hand, plots such as those shown in 
Figure 1.3–1.5 are necessary to interpret the factors that control the detection 
range at a given elevation. Both presentations, and other intermediate results, are 
needed to avoid errors that are commonly encountered in estimating radar range.  
1.6.5 
Required Probability of Detection 
The detectability factor D used in the radar equation depends on the required 
probability of detection. That probability is often assumed to be Pd = 0.5–0.9, 
based on an arbitrary specification. The requirement actually depends on the oper-
ating mode of the system that accepts the radar output. A single alarm is seldom 
sufficient to alert the system to target presence, since reaction to such an alarm 
would be triggered by each random false alarm from noise or interference. Con-
firmation by a second detection and initiation of a track file is usually required, 
implying single-scan Pd  0.5 (often  0.8) for reliable track acquisition and 
maintenance. Figure 1.7 shows the number of scans required to obtain a given 
cumulative probability of track acquisition, as a function of single-scan Pd.

The probability of track retention for a given number of scans is shown in 
Figure 1.8, for different values of single-scan Pd. It is apparent from these two 
figures that Pd  0.8 is a requirement if the radar is to support reliable track-while-
scan.

their resources in such a way as to initiate and maintain tracks when Pd in the 
search mode is much lower than 0.8. Ability to schedule an immediate validation 
dwell after initial detection, possibly with an increase in transmitted energy rela-
tive to that used in the routine search function, permits target presence to be con-
firmed and tracking to be initiated with high probability, with small increases in 
time and energy requirements. The result is that the maximum tracking range is 
that at which the cumulative probability of detection Pc, rather than Pd, reaches an 
acceptable value. Values of Pd  0.3 or less can then be used in the radar equation, 
significantly extending radar range [27].

SUMMARY OF RADAR EQUATION DEVELOPMENT 
This chapter traces the evolution of the radar equation from its origin during 
World War II through its application to modern radars. The contributions of La-
mont Blake are emphasized, and his method of expressing the equations is sug-
gested as an accurate starting point for current and future analyses of radar per-
formance. Modifications to Blake’s equations are presented that adapt them to 
more complex characteristics and modes of modern radar systems, but his funda-
mental approach remains the foundation of reliable estimates of radar detection 
range. To quote Marcum [24, p. 1] in discussing the original radar equation,  
The number of pitfalls that may be encountered in the use of the above equation are almost 
without limit, and many of these difficulties have been recognized in the past. 
New difficulties have been recognized since Marcum published his study. Modern 
computational techniques overcome many of these limitations and provide results 
with high precision, but they often mask other problems while encouraging reli-
ance on procedures that induce errors far greater than the displayed precision. 
Avoiding such errors was central to Blake’s careful analysis of the problem. That 
is also the aim of the subsequent developments discussed in [20–22], in this chap-
ter, and throughout the remainder this book.

or proposed radar for which the major parameters are known. They can be used to 
test different sets of parameters and to compare the results of competing radar 
designs for a given task, determining which best meets requirements such as the 
range at which a specified detection performance is available given the available 
beam dwell time and investment in equipment and input power.  
The search radar equation is a modification of the basic equation that allows 
one to avoid the process of generating many alternative designs and testing them 
to see which can meet a specified objective. It provides an estimate of the mini-
mum radar size, as measured by the product of average transmitter power Pav and 
receiving antenna aperture area A, that can search a given volume of three-
dimensional space with a specified level of detection performance. Alternatively, 
it can define the volume that can be searched by a radar of specified size while 
providing a specified level of detection performance. Neither the wavelength nor 
the waveform need be known to obtain these estimates, and hence it is unneces-
sary to postulate details such as the signal processing methods or the resolution 
properties of the radar until a later stage in the synthesis or analysis of the radar 
design. 
The search radar equation originated in a 1948 study by Edward Barlow and 
his associates at Sperry Gyroscope Company that was presented in a classified 
report [1]. That report has apparently never been declassified, but the derivation of 
the equation was presented in [2] and it has subsequently seen wide use. For ex-
ample, it provides the basis for the definition of a class of radars whose siting was 
limited by the (now defunct) U.S.-Russian ABM Treaty to locations on the pe-
riphery of the using country, looking outward. It serves as a reference for quick 
evaluation and comparison of proposed radar designs and systems on which avail-
able data are limited.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
2.1 
DERIVATION OF THE SEARCH RADAR EQUATION 
The search radar equation is derived from an idealized model of the search pro-
cess. An angular sector is to be searched in a specified period of time by a trans-
mitting beam that may either scan the sector or illuminate it continuously, while 
one or more receiving beams recover and integrate the energy of resulting target 
echoes. Free-space propagation is assumed. A combined search loss factor is in-
cluded to account for departures from the idealized model of the radar and envi-
ronment. Steps in derivations of the equations are as follows. 
Search Sector. The first step in derivation of the search radar equation is to 
establish an idealized model of the search sector, specified as a solid angle s 
steradians, within which the radar resources of time and energy are to be confined. 
The solid angle s is normally specified in terms of the width Am of the azimuth 
sector and the upper and lower limits m and 0 of the elevation sector:

where Am is in radians. Note that the elevation angle m is positive for a surface-
based radar, for which normally 0  0. For a radar elevated above the surface, 
either or both angles can be negative, the only requirement being that m > 0. 
Transmitting Beam Sector. The transmitting beam is modeled as rectangular 
in shape with uniform gain over a beam sector bt  s given by

tmin = 
elevation of lower edge of transmitting beam (rad); 
et 
= 
tmax  tmin = elevation width of transmitting beam (rad). 
The transmitting beamwidths are either matched to the search sector or made 
small enough that the radar can scan the sector s with no overlap between adja-
cent beams or excursion beyond the sector. The latter case is normally assumed, 
justifying the small-angle approximation in (2.2). The solid angle b of the beam 
is related to the gain Gt of the idealized transmitting antenna by a simple expres-
sion, based on the assumption that the transmitted energy is confined to and uni-
formly distributed within the rectangular-shaped beam:

where 4 is the solid angle of a sphere surrounding the radar, over which an iso-
tropic antenna would spread the radiated power. Equation (2.3) states the fact that 
the gain Gt of an antenna varies inversely with the solid angle of its beam. We 
consider later the limitation on the gain that can be produced by a practical anten-
na, requiring replacement of the factor 4 by 4/Ln  10.75 from [3, p. 334]. 
Search Frame Time. Targets in the search sector are to be detected with spec-
ified probability within a search frame time ts. This allows expression of the ob-
servation (or dwell) time to in each transmitting beam position as

Further Assumptions. The following assumptions also apply to the idealized

aperture equal to the physical area2 of the receiving antenna, Ar = A:

 The target cross section is a constant , located on the axes of the nearest 
transmitting and receiving beams, at broadside to the antenna array if one is 
used. The basic steady-target detectability factor D0(1) for this case is as giv-
en by Rice [4] (see Section 4.2). 
 Free-space paths give pattern-propagation factors Ft = Fr = 1.  
 The system noise temperature Ts = T0 = 290K.  
                                                           
1  For electronically scanned array antennas, broadening of the beam at angles off broadside reduces 
the number of beams required to scan a given sector. 
2  We use here the physical aperture A rather than the effective receiving aperture Ar appearing in 
some discussions, to base the equation on a truly ideal reference.

The three-dimensional search volume is defined by the angular sector s and 
the maximum range Rm. The transmitting antenna gain and number of beams 
transmitted into the search sector cancel out of the equation, leaving the energy 
density per unit solid angle Pavts/s (in J/steradian) as the transmitter illumination 
density in the search sector. As long as the echo energy is collected efficiently by 
the receiving aperture A, it makes no difference whether the energy appears in 
short periods to << ts from a transmitting antenna with high Gt, or any longer peri-
od with lower Gt, approaching the limiting case of continuous low-gain illumina-
tion of the full sector for ts seconds by a nonscanning transmission: bt = s, nbt = 
1. If the transmitting beam scans the sector, the receiving beam must follow it to 
receive all the echo energy incident on the receiving aperture from the illumina-
tion of each beam position. If the transmitting beam illuminates a solid angle bt 
greater than that of a single receiving beam (i.e., the transmitting aperture is 
smaller than A), then multiple receiving beams must be formed in parallel to col-
lect the echo energy returned to the receiving antenna. Receiving aperture effi-
ciency a < 1.0 for requires that the corresponding loss factor L = 1/a be includ-
ed in the system loss factor. If coherent integration is not performed over the ob-
servation time to, a corresponding noncoherent integration loss must be included 
in Ls.

The task assigned to the search radar determines five of the terms in (2.8):  
 
s, Rm, D0, ts, and .  
The factors 4, k and T0 are constants. Only Pav and A on the left side and Ls on 
the right side are controlled by decisions of the radar designer. The challenge in 
applying the search radar equation is to define the appropriate search sector s and 
estimate the losses that enter into Ls. These steps are critical to use of the equation,

since the idealized assumptions made in its derivation require that s be carefully 
defined and that many losses, usually totaling  20 dB or more, be identified and 
quantified. 
2.2 
SEARCH SECTORS FOR 2-D AIR SURVEILLANCE 
Air surveillance radars are described as two-dimensional (2-D) when their output 
data are range and azimuth, and three-dimensional (3-D) when range, azimuth, 
and elevation data are provided. Both types search within the three-dimensional 
space used in the search radar equation. 
2.2.1 
Elevation Coverage in 2-D Surveillance 
The 2-D air surveillance radar coverage pattern in elevation can seldom be defined 
simply in terms of the maximum and minimum elevation angles m and 0 used in 
(2.1). Requirements typically follow one of the curves plotted in Figure 2.1.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Air surveillance coverage is customarily specified in terms of the maximum 
altitude Hm of intended targets and required detection range Rm, over the full 360 
azimuth sector. The elevation coverage of the idealized beam, which is rectangu-
lar in angle space, is shown by solid lines as a right triangle. Its lower side extends 
horizontally (at zero elevation) from the radar to range Rm; the right side extends 
vertically from that point to an altitude Hm above the curved Earth; and the hypot-
enuse is a straight line returning from that point to the radar. The elevation beam-
width 1 (2.8 in the example shown) is expressed as

where 
Hm = 
maximum target altitude (m); 
ke 
=   4/3 = Earth’s radius factor; 
ae = 
6,378,000m = Earth’s radius. 
The minimum and maximum elevations for use in (2.1) are 0 = 0 and m = 1. 
The maximum-altitude target is detected the at range Rm, but at shorter ranges it 
lies above the idealized beam. This is far from ideal in the practical sense. One of 
the five other patterns shown will typically be used in practice, with appropriate 
entries in the search radar equation as described below. 
2.2.2 
Fan-Beam Pattern for 2-D Surveillance 
In fan-beam 2-D radar the elevation beam patterns for transmitting and receiving 
are matched to the required elevation search sector. A possible fan beam contour, 
shown in Figure 2.1 as a dashed curve, approximates the idealized triangle, but its 
half-power beamwidth has been adjusted to e  1.51 to include the point Rm, Hm. 
This moves the upper shoulder of its pattern above the hypotenuse of the triangle 
and extends the beam peak beyond Rm. Targets at altitude Hm still lie above the 
beam at R < 0.9Rm, so detection at maximum altitude is only possible in a narrow 
range interval near Rm. Even this small departure of the fan beam from the ideal-
ized coverage triangle requires the following adjustments of entries in the search 
radar equation. 
 An elevation beamshape loss Lpe = e/1  1.5 = 1.76 dB is included as a 
component of Ls to account for the increase in beamwidth of the 2-D radar 
antenna. This results from inability to synthesize the square-ended beam cor-
responding to the idealized triangular pattern shown in Figure 2.1, thus violat-
ing the assumption that the transmitted energy is uniform from 0 to 1, as 
used in defining s. This loss is reduced if the aperture height h is large 
enough to permit the full-range coverage pattern to be synthesized by com-

 
The Search Radar Equation 
39 
bining two or more narrow elevation beams to approximate a square-ended 
beam (see Section 10.1.4). 
 The elevation beamshape loss included in Ls is squared, to account also for 
the reduction in effective receiving aperture area Ar = A/Lpe. The two-way 
loss L2
pe in the search radar equation replaces the beamshape loss Lp = 1.24 
dB used in the conventional radar equation to give the reduction in average 
two-way gain for targets distributed over the elevation beamwidth (see Sec-
tion 5.2). 
 The search solid angle s for fan-beam 2-D radar is calculated using m = 1 
and 0 = 0 in (2.1). 
2.2.3 
Cosecant-Squared Pattern for 2-D Surveillance 
Another curve in Figure 2.1 shows a cosecant-squared elevation beam pattern. 
Here the mainlobe extends from zero elevation to 1 at range  Rm, but coverage 
continues along a horizontal line from that point to an upper elevation limit 2. 
Above 2 is a cone of silence in which coverage is lost. The idealized antenna gain 
as a function of elevation angle is

where Gm is the gain required to achieve detection at Rm.  
The search sector specified in the search radar equation can be adjusted for an 
idealized csc2 pattern by using an equivalent value of upper elevation given by

where Lcsc is the pattern loss in gain for the csc2 coverage compared to the fan 
beam with half-power width 1. This loss approaches a maximum of 3 dB for 
2 >> 1. Use of the equivalent upper elevation angle in calculating s accounts 
for the transmitted energy density over the search sector, but a second application 
of Lcsc is needed to reflect the reduction in effective receiving aperture. Thus, en-
tries in the search radar equation must be adjusted for the csc2 pattern as follows: 

40 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
 The required search solid angle s is increased by Lcsc, relative to the fan-
beam radar, to allow for diversion of transmitted energy into the upper shoul-
der of the pattern. 
 The Lcsc in effective receiving aperture is included in Ls. 
 The elevation beamshape loss Lpe remains as listed in Section 2.2.2. 
2.2.4 
Coverage to Constant Altitude 
Even with its extension above 1, the csc2 pattern does not quite meet the required 
altitude coverage to altitude Hm at ranges within Rm, because 1 from (2.9) has 
been reduced by the Earth’s curvature relative to the angle that would apply over a 
flat Earth. A slight adjustment to (2.10) can preserve coverage to that labeled 
“constant altitude” in Figure 2.1. The resulting losses in on-axis gain for the csc2 
and constant altitude patterns are shown in Figure 2.2, along with data for two 
other types of enhanced upper coverage, discussed below. The pattern loss due to 
the use of csc2 or other patterns with elevation coverage extended at ranges within 
Rm will be denoted here by Lcsc regardless of the exponent of the csc function used 
or the adjustment for coverage to constant target altitude. All the plots in Figure 
2.2 are calculated for a maximum elevation coverage angle 2 = 45, but there is 
negligible change as that angle varies from 30 to 60. The factor Lcsc appears both 
as an increase in s (for transmitting) and in Ls (for receiving).

where STC is applied. To avoid this, an antenna pattern with enhanced upper cov-
erage is used [6]. Two such curves are shown in Figure 2.1, corresponding to 
gains varying as csc3/2 and csc. Figure 2.2 includes plots of loss Lcsc for these 
two cases. For the csc pattern the equivalent upper elevation is given by

(2.12) 
As with csc2 coverage, both s and Ls are increased in the search radar equation to 
account for the extended coverage, and the elevation beamshape loss Lpe is also 
applied. 
2.2.6 
Reflector Antenna Design for 2-D Surveillance Radar 
Reflector antennas for csc2 or other enhanced upper coverage are designed in ei-
ther of two ways: (1) reflector area is added at the top or bottom of the parabolic 
surface, deviating from the parabola to divert that energy into the upper coverage 
region and illuminated by a broadened horn pattern; or (2) multiple feed horns are 
stacked one above the other, fed from a power divider whose coupling is adjusted 
to provide the desired pattern shape. Option (1) increases the physical aperture A 
but reduces the effective area Ar relative to a simple paraboloid, increasing the 
loss by the factor Lcsc relative to the fan beam (and by a greater factor relative to 
the increased area A). Option (2) uses the aperture height required for the 
mainlobe of width  1, but reduces its effective area by Lcsc. In both cases there is 
an increase in receiving aperture loss included in Ls, in addition to that caused by 
illumination tapers applied for sidelobe reduction in both coordinates and by spill-
over and feed blockage. 
2.2.7 
Array Antennas for 2-D Surveillance Radar 
There are also two design approaches available for electrically fixed array anten-
nas with csc2 or other enhanced upper coverage: (1) rows of radiators are added at 
the top or bottom of the array, for which the amplitudes and phases are adjusted to 
form the desired upper coverage; or (2) the number of element rows is chosen for 
an elevation beamwidth  1, and multiple feed lines are coupled to each row with 
complex weights that generate the radiated field contributions required for the 
upper coverage. The two methods are equivalent to those discussed for reflectors, 
and the same loss considerations apply. Active arrays are seldom used in 2-D ra-
dars, but if this is done the first option may be required to avoid distortion caused 
by saturation of power amplifiers with variation in the amplitude of excitation.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
2.2.8 
Example of Required Power-Aperture Product for 2-D Radar 
The search radar equation can be applied to estimate the power-aperture products 
required for each coverage curve of Figure 2.1. Typical parameters common to all 
coverage options are shown in Table 2.1. To compare results for a specific choice 
of radar band, the wavelength has been assumed as 0.23m (L-band), and the aper-
ture dimensions calculated based on a beamwidth constant K = aw/ = 1.1. The 
upper coverage is assumed to be obtained by manipulation of the illumination 
over the aperture height h = 5.2m needed to obtain e = 1.51. 
Table 2.2 shows the results of applying (2.8) to the parameters shown in Ta-
ble 2.1. The required power-aperture product increases as more power is diverted 
into the upper coverage. The increased requirement shown in the last two columns 
is attributable to the enhanced upper coverage made necessary by the application 
of STC to avoid receiver saturation from clutter and false alarms from small mov-
ing targets at short range.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL AIR SURVEILLANCE 
This section considers air surveillance conducted by radars that scan mechanically 
in azimuth, with elevation coverage provided by stacked beams that operate in 
parallel to cover the elevation sector or a single beam that scans the sector. Elec-
tronic scan in both coordinates, using a mechanically fixed array, is discussed in 
Section 2.4. 
2.3.1 
Stacked-Beam 3-D Surveillance Radars 
The stacked-beam 3-D radar uses a single transmitting pattern similar to that of 
the 2-D radar. Multiple, narrow receiving beams are stacked one above the other, 
within the transmitted beamwidth, to cover the elevation sector. The equivalent 
upper elevation angle m used in the search radar equation is given in Sections 
2.2.1–2.2.5. The gains of the receiving beams are selected independently, giving 
flexibility in apportioning of transmitting and receiving gains over the elevation 
sector. To obtain the equivalent of the csc2 2-D coverage, for example, one of the 
following approaches may be used: 
 Receiving beams use the gain of the full aperture, allowing the transmitting 
pattern to follow a csc4 pattern that minimizes the loss Lcsc.  
 Receiving beamwidths vary with elevation so that both transmitting and re-
ceiving gains follow the csc2 envelope, with losses as given in Section 2.2.3.  
 The transmitting pattern is csc2, while receiving beams following the csc1.5 or 
csc envelope to overcome the STC effect discussed in Section 2.2.5, while 
providing consistent height accuracy in the upper coverage.  
The first method is seldom used because it requires the largest number of receiv-
ing channels. The second uses fewer channels but the broad beamwidths at high 
elevations increase losses and compromise the accuracy of height measurement.  
The elevation beamshape loss Lpe applies to the transmitting antenna of a 
stacked-beam 3-D radar when the full-range coverage sector is provided by a sin-
gle beam (i.e., when the aperture height h  K/1). The loss is reduced when two 
or more beams are combined to approach a square-ended beam. For the stacked 
receiving beams Lpe  Lp = 1.24 dB, and Lcsc is based on the receiving gain profile 
applied to the upper coverage. 
2.3.2 
Scanning-Beam 3-D Surveillance Radars 
The scanning-beam 3-D radar has achieved wide use since development of the 
electronically scanned array (ESA). The basic problem is to cover all elevation 
beams in succession during the time of antenna scan through the azimuth beam-

44 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
width (the azimuth dwell time toa). Electronic scanning is combined with variation 
in elevation beamwidth, transmitted energy, and pulse repetition interval as a 
function of beam elevation, in order to cover the elevation sector within that time. 
As a result, the full aperture A is brought to bear only on lower elevation portions 
of the search sector. The equivalent upper elevation calculated in Sections 2.2.1–
2.2.5 accounts for the additional energy transmitted into the upper coverage, and 
the loss Lcsc approximately measures of the effect of the coverage extension on 
effective receiving aperture. The azimuth spacing between elevation scans often 
leads to increased beamshape losses relative to other types of surveillance radar 
(see Sections 2.4.2 and Chapter 5). 
The elevation beamshape loss Lpe applies to the transmitting antenna of a 
scanning-beam 3-D radar when the full-range coverage sector is provided by a 
single beam, but is reduced when two or more beams are combined to form a 
square-ended beam. The loss Lpe is the net beamshape loss Lpn for the scanned 
receiving beams (see Sections 5.3.5, 5.4.6, and 5.5.6), and Lcsc is based on the re-
ceiving gain profile applied to the upper coverage. 
2.3.3 
Search Losses in 3-D Surveillance Radar 
The class of 3-D surveillance radars discussed above rotate mechanically to cover 
the azimuth sector. The net azimuth beamshape loss Lpn is that calculated for the 
search radar equation but with a smaller number of samples per beamwidth for 
scanning-beam types, because of the need to cover many elevation beam positions 
during the azimuth dwell time. This increases the azimuth beamshape loss, espe-
cially for high values of Pd (see Chapter 5). In elevation, the specified Pd is re-
quired at range Rm on targets averaged over elevations 0    1, considering the 
pattern-propagation factor within the elevation mainlobe. To avoid too deep a 
drop in Pd near the horizon, the axis of the lowest beam is normally placed below 
1/2. In stacked-beam systems this may require a half-power transmitting beam-
width greater than 1, as discussed in Section 2.2.2. Other search loss components 
are as discussed in Section 2.6. 
2.4 
SURVEILLANCE WITH MULTIFUNCTION ARRAY RADAR 
The multifunction array radar (MFAR) can perform search as well as tracking and 
fire control functions, using one or more planar array faces. Each face may be 
served by an individual transmitter, or a common transmitter may be switched 
among faces. Allocation of radar resources in transmitted energy and time is var-
ied under software control according to the defense strategy or in response to the 
threat and environmental conditions. In place of a fixed search volume, as de-
scribed in Section 2.2, the MFAR search coverage is commonly divided into sev-

 
The Search Radar Equation 
45 
eral sectors, i = 1, 2, … m, with different values of Rmi, angle limits, and frame 
times tsi, and each sector is allocated some fraction of the resources. To establish 
requirements for the search fraction of the power-aperture product, the search ra-
dar equation is applied separately to each sector, and often to more than one threat 
condition. For example, there may be a “normal” condition under which a major 
fraction of the resources is assigned to the search function, and one or more “bat-
tle management” conditions requiring diversion of search resources to fire control. 
2.4.1 
Example of MFAR Search Sectors 
A typical search allocation for the normal condition (clear air, low engagement 
rate) is  50% of the total resources. An example of vertical coverage sectors for a 
long-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system for use against aircraft is shown 
in Figure 2.3. The requirements on each of m = 3 sectors are listed in Table 2.3. 
Within each sector, the narrow MFAR beam performs a raster scan with beams 
spaced by approximately 3, the half-power beamwidth (3 = 1.4 at broadside). 
The example assumes that a single array face is used, with azimuth sectors 
that are within the scan capability of typical array designs. The long-range and 
horizon sectors use a csc2 envelope, slightly modified to preserve coverage up to 
the maximum target altitude of the sector. The high-elevation sector is specified to 
provide coverage to the maximum target altitude at elevations above the long-
range sector, without overlapping that coverage. The horizon search sector over-
laps the long-range sector, and uses a high revisit rate to guard against low-

altitude threats that might be masked by terrain until they pop up at relatively 
short range. Its angular extent is minimized to avoid an excessive time allocation. 
Each dwell is assumed to use three pulses, providing frequency diversity or alter-
natively supporting moving-target indication (MTI).  
2.4.2 
Advantages and Disadvantages of MFAR Search 
An advantage of the MFAR search mode is that tracks can be initiated using vali-
dation and multiple track-initiation dwells immediately following the first detec-
tion, even when that detection results from a low signal-to-noise ratio with result-
ing low single-scan Pd. The range of track initiation is that for which the cumula-
tive probability of detection Pc, rather than single-scan Pd, reaches the desired level 
[7]. This rapid-validation approach is a form of sequential detection [8].  
Disadvantages in MFAR search are scan loss and the need to share radar re-
sources among the search sectors, including validation dwells and other radar 
functions. A further disadvantage is that the frequency band must be chosen to 
accommodate both search and tracking functions, and in general is too high for 
optimum search and too low for optimum tracking. The sharing of resources is 
best expressed by applying (2.7) separately to each search sector, using only the 
fraction of average power allocated to that sector. Similarly, (2.8) will yield the

required product of receiving aperture and the average power that must be allocat-
ed to the sector.  
MFAR design normally holds the peak power constant, but permits adjust-
ment of transmitted energy per beam through changes in pulsewidth. The same 
aperture is used for all sectors, but its effective value can be varied by defocusing, 
to reduce the allocated search time at the expense of increased energy per beam. 
MFAR beam broadening and pattern losses L and Lcsc are calculated in the 
same way as for a scanning-beam 3-D radar. For the coverage shown in Figure 2.3 
it can be assumed that Lpe = Lp = 1.24 dB for the long-range and high-altitude sec-
tors, because the detection envelope of the narrow scanning beam can be closely 
matched to the required coverage. For the low-altitude sector, Lpe  1.5 = 1.76 dB 
because the beamwidth is approximately  equal to the sector width. 
2.4.3 
Example of Search Radar Equation for MFAR 
As an example of using the search radar equation, assume that the terms common 
to the three regions shown in Figure 2.3 are as follows: 
 
Target cross section  = 1.0 m2; 
 
Detectability factor D0(1) = 15 dB; 
 
Search loss Ls = 20 dB; 
 
Array aperture A = 1.6 m2. 
The system temperature, search loss, and other parameters vary as shown in Table 
2.4. Other values in the table are obtained from (2.8) and Table 2.3. The example 
array aperture assumes an X-band radar with broadside beamwidth of 1.4, a 
broadening factor given by the secant of the off-broadside angle, and use of a fo-
cused beam throughout the coverage.  
Note that the average powers given by application of (2.8) are averaged over 
the entire operating time of the radar. The power averaged over a single sector is 
given by Pavi/TFi for sector i, and that averaged over the search time fraction is 
Pav/TF = 11.5 kW. A transmitter rated for  10 kW average power would be ade-
quate, provided that individual dwells up to 25.3 kW for  2 ms could be support-
ed for the horizon sector. 
In this example, the fact that the high-elevation sector consumes the largest 
time fraction while using the least average power suggests that it would be appro-
priate to defocus the beamwidths in that sector. Table 2.5 shows the result of in-
creasing both beamwidths by a factor of two. The time allocated for search is re-
duced, average power in the three search sectors is more uniform, but over the 
reduced search time fraction it averages twice that for the original allocations. Use 
of the search radar equation, however, makes this type of trade-off a simple exer-
cise.

THE SEARCH FENCE 
The search fence is a narrow coverage region, usually in elevation, through which 
a target must pass to enter a defended area. Warning of a target entering the de-
fended area is obtained using minimum resources, and subsequent tracking is as-
signed either to the tracking mode of the radar that provides the fence or to a sepa-
rate radar. An example of the search fence is the scan of a narrow elevation sector 
for detection of ballistic targets as they rise above the launch site or the radar hori-
zon. An early application of the technique was in location of hostile mortar or

the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) designed to alert the Unit-
ed States to attack by intercontinental missiles. 
2.5.1 
Search Sector for the Fence 
The geometry of a ballistic missile search fence is shown in Figure 2.4. Most 
search fence applications require coverage of a limited azimuth sector Am, typical-
ly 60–180. rather than the 360 coverage used in air surveillance. The minimum 
elevation is typically near zero, to minimize the delay between target launch and 
detection, although it may be set at 1–2 to reduce atmospheric attenuation in 
missile defense or surface clutter in hostile battery location.  
The available search frame time is determined by the maximum vertical ve-
locity vz of the expected targets, the number of scans nsc required for reliable de-
tection, and the elevation sector width:

2.5.2 
Example ICBM Fence 
For example, assume an ICBM search fence for the conditions shown in Table 
2.6. The target for this case is an ICBM launched from a site 2,600 km from the 
radar, which is deployed halfway between the defended area and the launch site.  
At the end of its boost phase, the ICBM is 600 km downrange with 250 km 
altitude and a velocity vt = 7 km/s directed 16 above the horizontal at that point, 
2,000 km from the radar. The tangent plane at the radar is tilted by some 18 from 
the horizontal at the target. The elevation angle of the velocity vector from the 
radar plane is 34, and the vertical velocity component is 3.9 km/s, resulting in an 
elevation rate e = 0.11/s. Assuming the two scans must be obtained during the 
passage of the target through the scan sector, the time per scan is ts = 9s. The re-
quired power-aperture product from (2.14) is

SEARCH LOSSES 
The apparent simplicity of the search radar equation is the result of the many as-
sumptions imposed on the idealized system. This approach leads, however, to the 
requirement that the system loss factor Ls accommodate many nonideal factors 
that characterize actual radar systems and environmental conditions. 
In Chapter 1, separate factors are included in the range equation for reduc-
tions in available energy ratio at the antenna output and increases in required en-
ergy ratio for the specified detection performance. The search loss factor Ls in-
cludes both sets of factors, along with others that are unique to the search radar 
equation. The losses, including reciprocals of the range-dependent factors F 2
rdr, are 
summarized here.  
2.6.1 
Reduction in Available Energy Ratio 
Components of Ls that reduce the available energy ratio are as follows: 
 Elevation Beamshape Loss Lpe. This loss results from obtaining the coverage  
to range Rm up to elevation angle 1 using a fan beam rather than the idealized 
square-ended triangular beam (see Section 2.2.2). 
 Pattern Loss Lcsc. The loss results from extending elevation coverage above 
1 at ranges R < Rm. (see Section 2.2.3). 
 Antenna Dissipative Loss La. This loss adjusts the idealized antenna gains 
used in (2.3) and (2.6), which are actually the directivities Dt and Dr of the 
antennas, to the actual power gains Gt. and Gr (see Section 10.1.5). 
 Pattern Constant Ln. This loss adjusts the gain-beamwidth relationship of the 
idealized transmitting beam assumed in deriving (2.3) to correspond to the 
value achievable in actual antennas. Ln = 1.16–1.28 (0.64–1.07 dB) applies to 
rectangular and elliptical apertures with illumination varying from uniform to 
low-sidelobe tapers. Reflector and lens antennas typically have an additional 
loss of 0.6–1.0 dB from spillover and (in reflectors) from blockage (see Sec-
tion 10.1.5). 
 Receiving Aperture Efficiency a. The ideal gain Gr appearing in (2.6) applies 
to a uniformly illuminated aperture under ideal conditions, but must be re-
duced for factors that result from tapered illumination, blockage of the path 
into space, spillover in space-fed antennas, and tolerances in construction that 
cause departures from a radiated plane wave (see Section 10.1.5).  
 Receiving Noise Loss Lrec. The temperature T0 = 290K is used to establish the 
noise spectral density in (2.7). The loss that accounts for the actual system 
noise temperature Ts (see Chapter 6) is defined as

where Ts is averaged over the search sector. 
 Transmission Line Loss Lt (see Section 10.1.1). 
 Atmospheric Attenuation L. For use in the search radar equation this loss 
(see Chapter 7) is calculated by averaging the attenuation over the two-way 
path to the limits of the search sector.3 
 Polarization Loss Lpol. This loss is the reciprocal of the polarization factor Fp
2 
introduced in (1.23) to describe the reduced received energy resulting from 
mismatch of the received polarization to that of the echo from a target cross 
section  when illuminated by the transmitting antenna (see Section 10.1.1). 
 Range-Dependent Response Loss Lrdr. This loss is the reciprocal of the range-
dependent response factor Frdr (see Sections 1.6.2 and 10.1.2). 
2.6.2 
Increase in Required Energy Ratio 
The product kT0D0(1) in (2.8) represents the minimum required energy ratio for 
detection on a steady target using a single coherently integrated sample of the re-
ceived signal, for an idealized receiving system in a room-temperature environ-
ment. Factors in the radar that increase the required energy ratio and must be in-
cluded in Ls are listed below. 
 Integration Loss Li (see Section 4.4.3). 
 Fluctuation Loss Lf (see Section 4.4.5). 
 Matching Factor M (see Section 10.2.3). 
 Beamshape Loss Lpe (see Section 2.2.2 and Chapter 5).  
 Miscellaneous Signal Processing Loss Lx (see Sections 1.3.1 and 10.2.5). 
 Scan Sector Loss Lsector (see Section 10.2.1). 
 Scan Distribution Loss Ld (see Section 10.1.4). 
2.6.3 
Summary of Losses 
The losses listed in Section 2.6.1 include ten factors (some of them consisting of 
contributions from several components), that reduce the available energy ratio. 
Those can be grouped into a single value L1, as used previously in (1.7) to repre-
sent the RF loss in energy ratio at the antenna output, as listed in the first part of 
Table 2.7. Four components of Lrdr are listed separately. A further seven losses 
                                                           
3  Strictly speaking, the fraction of energy 1/L after attenuation is averaged over the elevation sector, 
and the attenuation calculated as the reciprocal of that average. 

 
The Search Radar Equation 
53 
that increase the required energy ratio, listed in Section 2.6.2, can be grouped into 
a value L2, also listed in the table.  
Estimates of loss are shown for two typical systems: a mechanically scanning 
2-D radar with the constant-altitude coverage shown in Figure 2.1, and an active 
electronically scanned array (AESA) that covers the same elevation coverage in 
an azimuth sector 45 from broadside. No attempt has been made to detail the 
time budget for the AESA, and the loss estimates are approximate for both sys-
tems, but the total losses are realistic for both systems, relative to the results pre-
dicted for a given product of average power Pav and physical receiving aperture A.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The total search loss is normally in the order of 20 dB, reducing the detection 
range to about one-third of that available in a “perfect” radar with the same prod-
uct of average power and physical aperture. The mechanically scanned system 
estimates shown in Table 2.7 total almost 24 dB, while the AESA system total is 
18 dB, in spite of the minimal RF losses within the radar. More accurate evalua-
tions are possible only when the radar parameters are defined in much greater de-
tail than is usual in early phases of a radar development or procurement. When 
considering using the search radar equation in a particular application, however, it 
is possible to use results from a number of radars that have been developed for 
similar applications, and to estimate the minimum Lsmin that can be expected. Sub-
stituting Lsmin in the search radar equation provides a starting point for estimating 
the minimum size of the radar that will be required. When that process leads to a 
specific radar design, the applicable loss components may then be determined to 
refine the calculation.

CHAPTER 3 
RADAR EQUATIONS FOR CLUTTER 
AND JAMMING  
3.1 
SIGNAL-TO-INTERFERENCE RATIO 
IEEE definitions [1] are used in this book.  
Clutter: Unwanted echoes, typically from the ground, sea, rain or other precipitation, chaff, 
birds, insects, meteors, and aurora. 
Jamming: A form of electronic countermeasures (ECM) in which interfering signals are 
transmitted at frequencies in the receiving band of a radar for the purpose of obscuring the ra-
dar signal (as in noise jamming) or causing confusion in interpreting the radar signal (as in re-
peater jamming). 
Target: Broadly, any discrete object that scatters energy back to the radar. Specifically, an ob-
ject of radar search or tracking. 
The typical sources of clutter listed in the definition apply to radars whose targets 
are manmade objects such as aircraft, missiles, land vehicles, or vessels operating 
in the natural environment that contributes the clutter. In this chapter we adhere to 
that definition. Radars used in navigation, mapping, meteorology, or geophysical 
research are intended to detect or image the natural environment as the target, and 
hence will regard the manmade objects as clutter. Radar equations applicable to 
those applications differ from those discussed here. 
In this book, the signal is the echo from a target, while interference is the sum 
of unwanted inputs to the receiver, including thermal noise, clutter, and jamming. 
To be consistent with the description of target signals and thermal noise in Chap-
ter 1, interference is described by the energy I0 that passes the processor within a 
resolution cell that may also contain the target:

where N0 is the spectral density of thermal noise, C0 the energy of the clutter, and 
J0 that of the jamming, all referred to the output port of the receiving antenna. The 
resolution cell in which interference is measured is defined as [1]: 
The one-dimensional or multidimensional region related to the ability of a radar to resolve 
multiple targets. Note: The dimensions that involve resolution can include range, angle, and 
radial velocity (Doppler frequency). The three-dimensional spatial resolution cell is, for ex-
ample:

where a = azimuth beamwidth, e = elevation beamwidth,  = pulsewidth, c = velocity of

Interference whose spectrum is spread across the bandwidth of the processor (e.g., 
thermal noise or broadband jamming) is described by the spectral density within 
that bandwidth, replacing N0 in (1.8) and in subsequent radar equations.  
Clutter enters the receiver with the RF spectrum of the transmitted signal, and 
with a Doppler shift that is usually different from that of the target. Its effect on 
the processed output, and on the required threshold setting that determines detec-
tion probability, must be evaluated differently from that of broadband interfer-
ence. When signal processing is used to suppress clutter (e.g., Doppler-based pro-
cessing), an effective input spectral density C0e expresses the effect of the sup-
pressed interference, referred back to the input where signal energy is measured:

The procedure for calculation and use of effective interference spectral densi-
ty I0e is to evaluate the noise density N0 and the energy ratios C0e/N0 and J0e/N0, 
insert these in (3.2), and then replace the noise spectral density N0 in the denomi-
nator of the radar equation with I0e. Derivation of such an equation requires the 
same basic steps that were used in Chapter 1 for the noise environment: 
 Express the maximum signal-to-interference ratio E/I0e that is available with 
given parameters, as a function of target range R; 
 Express the minimum signal-to-interference ratio Dx that is required to meet 
detection requirements; 
 Combine these expressions to solve for the maximum target range Rm at 
which the requirement is met for the specified radar in the environment. 
The interference that competes with a target at range R may enter the radar 
simultaneously with the target signal and at the same frequency, or may be super-
imposed on the signal as a result of ambiguous response of the receiver/processor 
in time delay (range) or frequency. In general, the equations for interference spec-
tral density are complicated functions of target range, radar waveform, and envi-

ronmental conditions. Closed-form solutions for detection range can be obtained 
only for special cases. Solutions using graphical techniques or root-finding algo-
rithms are used for the more general case. 
3.2 
CLUTTER EFFECT ON DETECTION RANGE  
Clutter may arise from a surface area on the Earth (land or sea), from a volume in 
the atmosphere (precipitation, chaff, insects, or aurora), or from discrete objects 
on or above the surface (prominent surface features, birds, or meteors). The gen-
eral method of range calculation for all types of clutter is discussed here, and ap-
plied in following sections to each individual type. 
3.2.1 
Range-Ambiguous Clutter 
Energy from clutter in the spatial resolution cell at a range Rc equal to the target 
range R is one source of interference that competes with the signal entering the 
receiver. However, calculation of input clutter energy, even for low PRF wave-
forms intended to avoid range ambiguity, must also consider all cells at ranges 
given by

Types of Radar Waveforms 
Radar waveforms are defined [1] as belonging to one of four types, for each of 
which a different clutter analysis is necessary. 
 Low-PRF (LPRF) Waveform: 
A pulsed-radar waveform whose pulse-repetition frequency is such that targets of interest are 
unambiguously resolved with respect to range. 
While targets of interest lie within the unambiguous range, clutter may origi-
nate beyond that range (i > 0). The energy received from each ambiguity is 
multiplied by the factor (R/Rci)4 = R4/(R + iRu)4, relative to clutter at target 
range R, and may contribute to interference even for i > 0, especially if it is 
not reduced by the clutter improvement factor applicable to clutter at range R. 
 Medium-PRF (MPRF) Waveform:  
A pulsed-radar waveform whose pulse-repetition frequency is such that targets of interest are 
ambiguous with respect to both range and Doppler shift. 
For this waveform, clutter at Rc < R (for which i < 0), as well as at Rc  R, 
contributes to interference. The contributions from short-range ambiguities 
exceed that from Rc = R by a large factor when (R + iminRu) << R. 
 High-PRF (HPRF) Waveform: 
A pulsed-radar waveform whose pulse-repetition frequency is such that targets of interest are 
ambiguous with respect to range. 
The HPRF, chosen to avoid Doppler ambiguities, exceeds the MPRF, intro-
ducing more range ambiguities and increasing the input interference, espe-
cially from clutter at range Rci << R. 
 Continuous-Wave (CW) Waveform: 
The CW radar is defined as a radar that transmits a continuous-wave signal 
that may be phase-modulated. The spatial resolution cell for an unmodulated 
CW waveform is bounded by the antenna beam and extends to a maximum 
range toc/2, where to is the dwell time of the antenna beam. The input clutter 
energy in any given environment is greater than that of an HPRF waveform, 
although use of separate transmitting and receiving antennas may reduce clut-
ter from very short ranges. CW waveforms with periodic phase modulation

having repetition interval tr produce range ambiguities at intervals Ru identical 
to those of pulsed radars with PRI = tr. 
3.2.3 
Clutter Detectability Factor 
The detectability factor Dx used in the radar equations of Chapter 1 is the required 
ratio of the signal energy to the spectral density of white Gaussian noise. Clutter 
differs from noise in two ways: (1) it is not random from pulse to pulse, and hence 
its spectrum consists of discrete lines within the signal bandwidth; and (2) its am-
plitude distribution may spread beyond that of the Rayleigh distribution that char-
acterizes the sum of in-phase and quadrature Gaussian noise components. Hence, 
a different clutter detectability factor Dxc must be used. 
3.2.3.1 Clutter Spectrum and Correlation Time 
The spectra of different types of clutter (see Chapter 9) are characterized by the 
mean radial velocity relative to the radar and the spread of each spectral line. Ve-
locity parameters are used in preference to the mean and spread of Doppler fre-
quency because they characterize the clutter independently of the radar frequency.  
Spread is measured by the standard deviation v in velocity that results from 
random motion of the clutter scatterers, antenna beam scanning, and projection of 
the mean radial velocity on the antenna pattern. The spread affects the number nc 
of independent clutter samples available for integration, which can be expressed 
as a function of the correlation time tc of the clutter at the radar input and the ob-
servation (dwell) time of the radar beam [2, p. 117]:

where n is the number of noise samples integrated. When clutter appears in more 
than one range ambiguity, different values vi and tci are found for each range Ri. 
3.2.3.2 Clutter Correlation Loss 
In the absence of Doppler processing, the clutter detectability factor depends on 
nc, rather than the number n of target pulses integrated. The increase in required 
energy ratio is described by the clutter correlation loss Lcc:

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Note that this loss does not reduce the effect of clutter, but rather increases it to 
reflect the increase in signal-to-clutter ratio required for target detection, as com-
pared to white Gaussian noise. 
Doppler-based signal processing increases the number of independent sam-
ples in (3.6), which depends on the spectrum of the clutter at the processor output, 
thus reducing Lcc relative to that applicable to the input clutter. Methods of calcu-
lating nc and Lcc for systems using Doppler processing are given in Chapter 9. The 
loss Lcci is applied to increase in the effective spectral density for each ambiguity. 
3.2.3.3 Clutter Distribution Loss 
The second source of increased clutter detectability factor is the broader amplitude 
distribution of some clutter. The detectability factors calculated for noise are 
based on a detection threshold that is high enough to meet the specified false-
alarm probability on the exponentially distributed noise power, adjusted for inte-
gration. The probability density function (pdf) of volume clutter is approximately 
exponential, as is surface clutter when viewed at high grazing angles. But the pdf 
spreads as the grazing angle decreases, and can be modeled as a Weibull distribu-
tion having a spread parameter aw  1. The spread varies from aw = 1 for the ex-
ponential distribution to aw  5 for extreme cases.  
This factor increases the clutter detectability factor Dxc by a clutter distribu-
tion loss Lcd. This loss applies to a two-parameter constant-false-alarm-rate 
(CFAR) processor that controls the threshold using estimates of both the mean and 
spread of input clutter. It is defined as the ratio of the threshold yb required to ob-
tain a specified false-alarm probability Pfa with the actual clutter distribution to 
that required for the exponential distribution (see Section 4.2.2). For clutter with a 
Weibull distribution:

where Pw
1(p,aw) is the inverse function of the integral of the Weibull distribution 
for probability p with spread parameter aw and P
1(p) is the inverse function for 
the incomplete gamma function. The width of the pdf varies over range ambigui-
ties, and separate values of Lcdi are applied as factors to find the effective spectral 
density at each range Ri. 
Given the large loss that results when Weibull clutter with aw >> 1 is input to 
a two-parameter CFAR processor, many radars supplement the CFAR process 
with a clutter map that suppresses clutter peaks (and targets) in the resolution cells 
where they are observed over several scans. Since these peaks are relatively 
sparse, even in regions of strong clutter, the loss is confined to individual map 
cells and the average loss in detection probability caused by target suppression is 

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
61 
relatively small. The peaks can be considered discrete clutter, effects of which are 
described in Section 3.5, rather than by the clutter distribution loss of (3.8). 
3.2.3.4 Clutter Detectability Factor 
The clutter detectability factor, denoted here by Dxc, is defined [1] as: 
The predetection signal-to-clutter ratio that provides stated probability of detection for a given 
false alarm probability in an automatic detection circuit. Note: In MTI systems, it is the ratio 
after cancellation or Doppler filtering. 
The losses Lcc from Section 3.2.3.2 and Lcd from Section 3.2.3.3 give corrections 
that are applied to the detectability factor Dx to account for the difference between 
clutter and noise statistics:

The synonym in the definition covers CW and pulsed Doppler as well as MTI 
radars, and will be used here. The improvement factor for different processing 
methods is discussed in Section 9.6. It may vary over the individual ambiguous 
regions, but an average value

value of Dx in the radar equation to solve for detection range.  
3.2.5 
Detection Range with Clutter 
The effective clutter energy given by (3.11) is added to the noise spectral density 
N0 to obtain the effective interference energy I0e in the environment of clutter and 
noise. This allows the detection range Rmc in clutter to be expressed as:

where n = to/tf is the number of intervals tf over which noncoherent integration is 
performed during the observation time to. Since many terms on the right-hand side 
of this equation are range-dependent, Rmc must generally be found graphically or 
by root-finding. Exceptions to this general rule, where this equation may be writ-
ten in closed form for surface and to volume clutter, are given in Sections 3.3.5 
and 3.4.6. 
The graphical procedure is to plot separately the signal energy E from (1.25) 
and required energy I0eDx(n) = (N0 + C0e)Dx(n) as functions of target range R. 
The detection requirement is met at ranges for which E  I0e + Dx(n) and the 
longest such range is Rmc. The root-finding procedure is to express E and I0eDx(n) 
as separate functions of R, and create a computer program to find the largest R at 
which the two expressions are equal:

DETECTION IN SURFACE CLUTTER 
Surface clutter is backscatter from land or sea surfaces illuminated by the radar 
beam. Two geometrical models of surface clutter are described below: a simple, 
flat-Earth model, and a spherical-Earth model that is detailed further in Chapter 8.  
3.3.1 
Clutter from a Flat Surface 
The geometry of surface clutter observed by a the mainlobe of a radar antenna at 
altitude hr above a flat surface is shown in Figure 3.1. The clutter cell lies within

the elliptical beam footprint defined by the beamwidths e in elevation and a in 
azimuth, reduced in each case by the beamshape loss Lp to account for the reduced 
two-way antenna gain of off-axis scatterers.1 Sidelobe clutter is normally much 
smaller and insignificant, but is discussed in Section 3.6. 
The width of the cell is set by the range Rc and the azimuth beamwidth a. 
The depth (range dimension) is usually set by the range resolution r:2

where n is the width of the processed pulse and c is the velocity of light. As stated

the 3-dB width 3 conventionally used, but rather a pulsewidth defined in [4, p. 
342] in a way similar to the noise bandwidth of a network:

where a(t) is the pulse waveform voltage at the processor output and am is its peak

mately 1.06 = 0.24 dB for the outputs of matched filters for rectangular pulses and 
for most pulse compression waveforms. 
                                                           
1  The beamshape loss used in equations for clutter is Lp = 1.33, as obtained for dense sampling by 
integration over the two-way beam pattern (5.1), and denoted by Lp0 (see Section 5.2.3). The addi-
tional subscript 0 is used there to distinguish the dense-sampling value from the varying Lp applica-
ble to targets for the general case that may include sparse sampling, as discussed in Chapter 5. The 
subscript 0 is omitted from equations in this chapter for compactness.

The beam footprint usually extends beyond the range resolution cell, but as  
increases, and especially for narrowband waveforms, the range resolution cell may 
extend beyond the footprint. This leads to two alternative expressions for the sur-
face area included in the resolution cell.

The need to modify the half-power beamwidth in (3.18) by the factor Lp, now 
called beamshape loss, is recognized in early work on clutter [5, p. 483. Eq. (93)], 
but that factor is used inconsistently in subsequent work, perhaps because error 
from its omission is considered unimportant in comparison with other uncertain-
ties in clutter modeling. Blake’s simple formulation [3, p. 26, Eq. (1.43)] omits 
this factor, but his more detailed discussion of clutter [3, p. 296, Eq. (7.7)] pre-
sents an expression that invokes integration over the beam pattern.4 Other litera-
ture uses a “two-way half-power beamwidth” defined as 
2,
a

 which is 0.26 dB 
less than the correct value.  
                                                           
3  The beamwidth in (3.18) is assumed small enough that the small-angle approximation applies. Oth-
erwise, a should be replaced by 2tan(a/2); the error in approximation is < 0.01 dB for a < 10. 
4  That equation contains a typographical error in using the one-way voltage pattern f(,) rather than 
the two-way power pattern f(,)4.

For this beamwidth-limited case, the factor 1/L2
p is the same as the integral in the

viously cited. The factor /4 = 1.05 dB, appearing in Blake [3, p. 296, (7.4)] and 
elsewhere, is inaccurate for actual antenna patterns, to which 1/L2
p = 2.48 dB ap-
plies. 
3.3.1.3 Unequal Transmitting and Receiving Beamwidths 
The azimuth beamwidth used in calculating clutter area is the one-way, half-
power beamwidth a when the transmitting and receiving beam patterns are iden-
tical. When they differ, an effective beamwidth may be substituted, calculated as

 These relationships apply also to elevation beamwidth in

3.3.1.4 Effect of Range Ambiguities 
As discussed in Section 3.2, clutter energy originates not only from the resolution 
cell at the target range R but also in range ambiguities at intervals Ru within and 
beyond R. The range Rci from the ith ambiguity is then used in (3.18) and (3.19) to 
find an area Aci for each ambiguous clutter region, and (3.5) applied to find the 
total clutter energy. Multiple ambiguities may also occur for MPRF and HPRF in 
the beamwidth-limited case.

For moderate sea surfaces and flatland (h < 1m), expressions for grazing an-

where 0 is the surface clutter reflectivity, defined in [1] as the “backscatter coef-
ficient of clutter,” which in turn is defined as: 
A normalized measure of radar return from a distributed scatterer. For area targets, such as 
ground or sea clutter, it is defined as the average monostatic radar cross section per unit sur-
face area. 
The superscript 0 originated at the MIT Radiation Laboratory [5, p. 483], probably 
to suggest that 0 is a dimensionless quantity expressing radar cross section in m2 
per m2 of area Ac.  
In some literature, 0 has been defined or assumed to include the pattern-
propagation factor Fc. The two separate terms for reflectivity 0 and pattern-
propagation factor Fc are used here to distinguish properties of the surface area Aci 
(included in 0) from those of the radar-to-surface path (included in Fc). Folding 
the latter into 0 obscures the physical principles that underlie the effects of graz-
ing angle and radar frequency on clutter echoes that reach the radar. Identical ra-
dars observing the same clutter cell with the same grazing angle will receive dif-
ferent echo powers depending on the contour of intervening terrain, and this can-
not properly be attributed to 0 for that cell.  
Data on 0 and Fc for different surfaces are given in Chapter 9, including dis-
cussion of the constant- model for surface clutter, [2, p. 108]:

In this model, which we will use here and which agrees closely with measured

length. The variation in backscattered power for different viewing geometries is 
captured in the grazing angle  and the clutter pattern-propagation factor Fc.

where hr is the altitude of the antenna phase center above the average clutter sur-
face. For shipboard or airborne radar, hr is the height of the ship superstructure or 
the altitude of the aircraft that carries the radar antenna. For land-based radar, it is 
the sum of antenna height above the ground and the altitude of that ground above 
the surface clutter viewed by the beam. A land-based radar site is usually selected 
on high ground that can be assumed to be 2h above the mean surface. The ap-
proximation in (3.26) is adequate when the Earth’s curvature permits use of the 
flat-Earth model within range R1.  
In the following discussions of surface clutter, examples are presented to il-
lustrate the nature of the clutter problem for surface-based radars. The parameters 
of the pulsed and CW radars used in these examples, and the surface environment 
that characterizes the clutter, are shown in Table 3.1.

inside the far-field defined in Section 3.4.6. The different regions for clutter modeling are discussed 
further in Section 9.1.2.

The problem in applying this expression to a calculation of detection range Rmc is 
that the range dependence of the clutter pattern-propagation factor Fc i and the 
grazing angle i preclude writing of a closed-form expression for Rmc, even when 
the target pattern-propagation factor is constant. 
For example, Figure 3.2 shows a plot of signal and clutter energy levels for an 
LPRF radar with a pulsewidth n = 1 s. The radar achieves detection in noise at 
Rm = 93.2 km, but as the target, as it flies along the beam axis near zero elevation 
angle. Reflection lobing and possible diffraction loss is omitted from the calcula-
tion. As the target comes within the clutter horizon at 15 km the clutter rises, re-
ducing the ratio of signal to interference below the required Dx = 20 dB. Within 1-
km range, the clutter falls below the elevation beam, restoring the necessary detec-
tion margin. However, the range interval within which detection is impaired can-

not be found from any simple equation, and reading from the graph or an equiva-
lent root-finding algorithm is necessary. The required improvement factor to avoid 
impairment, Im  18 dB, can be determined from the graph at R = 5 km. 
3.3.4.2 Input Surface Clutter Energy in CW Radar 
Although unmodulated continuous-wave (CW) radar is less widely used than in 
the past, equations developed in this section also serve as starting point for simpli-
fied clutter calculations in HPRF pulsed Doppler radar. Surface clutter in HPRF 
radar and in phase-modulated CW radar can be described by the expressions given 
in Section 3.3.4.1 for pulsed radar, with n representing the width of the range 
resolution cell resulting from a modulated waveform. When several such ambigui-
ties contain clutter, the expressions developed here, modified as in Section 3.3.4.3, 
provide an alternative method that is often more convenient. 
Surface clutter in unmodulated CW radars is beamwidth-limited, according to 
(3.19). At low grazing angles the reflectivity, pattern-propagation factor, and im-
provement factor vary with range within the beam footprint in a way similar to 
those in different ambiguities of pulsed radars. The following expression for clut-
ter energy density as a function of range replaces Ci in (3.5), as noted by Blake 
[3, pp. 298–300]:

rected at the horizon, can be reduced only by increasing the height hr of the anten-
na above the surface, decreasing the ratio of elevation to azimuth beamwidth or 
transmitting less energy (which also reduces signal energy). 
Clutter input can be reduced by tilting the antenna axis upwards. The integral

where erf(·) is the error function. The result for b = e/3, shown by the dashed 
line in Figure 3.3, reduces the integrated clutter energy by 9.3 dB. The ratio of 
clutter energy for an elevated beam to that for a horizontal beam, given for clutter 
by (3.36), may be expressed by including a beam elevation factor Fb
4, plotted in 
Figure 3.4 for both the Gaussian beam and the beam pattern of an aperture with 
cosine taper. Also shown is the factor F 4 for targets at elevation t = 0. The clutter 
is slightly larger for the Gaussian beam with small elevation because the mainlobe 
pattern decays more slowly, but the more realistic cosine illumination generates 
sidelobes that govern the factor for axis elevations above one beamwidth. The 
improvement in signal-to-clutter ratio for elevated beams is the difference be-
tween the clutter and target factors (e.g., 6.6 dB for b = 0.33e). 
The beam elevation factor in Figure 3.4 for the cosine taper was calculated by 
numerical integration. It shows that the clutter energy expressions developed for 
the Gaussian beam are adequate for beams elevated less than about one beam-
width.

3.3.4.3 Input Surface Clutter Energy in Pulsed Doppler Radar 
In pulsed Doppler radar, a range gate matched to the pulse width  and centered at 
range Rc from the transmitted pulse passes clutter energy given by integration of 
the clutter density over ambiguous ranges (Rc + iRu)  c/4. Figure 3.5 shows the 
clutter energy in each of nine 1-s gates between successive pulses at tr = 10 s, 
including the first four range ambiguities and using the clutter density shown in 
Figure 3.3. The rectangular gate, sampling over 75m from its center, passes clut-
ter energy given by 
 
C0 (dBJ) = density dB(J/m) + 10log(150m) = density dB(J/m) + 21.8 dB(m) 
at each ambiguous range. The clutter energy varies by 6 dB over the nine gates 
(the potential tenth gate is totally eclipsed by the transmitted pulse). The average 
over the gates is 10 dB below the level for the CW radar, as expected for a duty 
cycle Du = /tr = 0.1. For gates 1 and 2 the beam does not reach the surface until 
the second range ambiguity, giving lower clutter than in gates 3–9.

tor Flens. Use of the attenuation and lens factor for the thermal-noise range Rm gives slightly pessi-
mistic results, which are generally adequate given uncertainties in clutter characteristics. The accu-

of power from range ambiguities as in (3.11) and (3.12), but when several ambi-
guities are occupied by clutter it may be easier to apply the CW radar equations 
with a correction for the effects of duty cycle and pulse compression. The clutter, 
when averaged over all ranges in the pulse repetition interval (PRI), is given by 
(3.28)–(3.36) with the duty cycle Du = /tr included as a factor in the numerators. 
Note that Du is also applied to convert peak power Pt to in average power Pav, so 
the clutter energy varies with Du
2 for a given peak power. The pulse compression 
ratio /n appears also in the denominator when a phase-modulated pulse is used.  
The clutter density as a function of range is as given in Figure 3.2, and is in-
tegrated over aliased responses as in Figure 3.4. The duty factor and the pulse 
compression ratio are included in the numerator of (3.36), leading to:

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
As in the CW radar case, the value of L(Rmc) within the brackets can be an ap-
proximation based on the range in thermal noise, or the result of the two-step iter-
ation used in the Blake chart. 
The pulsed Doppler radar has lower input clutter than a CW radar using the 
same antenna parameters and average power. The available improvement factor, 
however, is reduced by the aliasing of the clutter residue spectrum at intervals of 
the PRF, which adds multiple aliased components to the output of the target Dop-
pler filter [2, pp. 248–252]. The resulting clutter performance is not necessarily 
better than the CW radar. The major advantages of the PD radar are that a com-
mon antenna is used for transmitting and receiving, and target range may be 
measured by combining observations at different PRFs. 
3.3.6 
Summary of Detection in Surface Clutter 
The steps in solving for detection range in an environment of surface clutter and 
thermal noise can be summarized as requiring calculation of the surface clutter 
reflectivity , using data from Chapter 9, and the following quantities that are 
functions of range Rc: 
 Ambiguous ranges Rci at which clutter competes with the target at range R, 
from (3.3), the corresponding areas Aci, from (3.18) or (3.19), and grazing an-
gles i from (3.16) or equivalent spherical-Earth equations. 
 Clutter pattern-propagation factor Fci, and atmospheric attenuation Lci for 
each area, using data from Chapter 8. 
 Clutter cross section from (3.23), and the resulting clutter input energy from 
(3.5) for clutter ranges Rci. 
 Clutter correlation loss Lcci, based on number of independent clutter samples 
available for integration from (3.7), using data on clutter velocity spread vi 
for each ambiguity from Chapter 9, and accounting for Doppler improvement 
factor when such processing is used. 
 Clutter distribution loss Lcdi from (3.8), based on Weibull spread parameter 
1  awi  5 from data in Chapter 9, modified as necessary for clutter-map pro-
cessing. 
 Effective clutter spectral density C0e from (3.11), based on summation of ef-
fective clutter energies from all ambiguities, or from (3.33) for CW radar. 
 Total interference spectral density I0e from (3.2). 
 Detection range Rmc from (3.12) for the general case, from (3.39) or (3.39) for 
CW radar, from (3.43) or (3.44) for pulsed Doppler, or from a graphical or 
root-finding method.

DETECTION IN VOLUME CLUTTER 
Volume clutter arises from precipitation or chaff within the radar resolution cell. 
The inclusion of energy from volume clutter follows the procedures given in Sec-
tions 3.1 and 3.2 and applied to surface clutter in Section 3.3. The effective spec-
tral density C0e for volume clutter is added to that of surface clutter when both are 
present at the detection range. 
3.4.1 
Geometry of Volume Clutter 
The geometry of volume clutter is shown in Figure 3.6. The resolution cell is de-
fined by the antenna beamwidths, reduced by beamshape loss, and the range reso-
lution cell r by (3.14) or for CW radar by the integration of (3.33). 
At ranges where the cloud fills the radar beam, the volume Vc of the clutter in 
the resolution cell at range ambiguity i is

where the lower and upper limits of the ambiguity index i are as defined in (3.3), 
depending on the location and radial dimension of the cloud. The horizontal cross-
range dimension of the cloud is usually assumed to extend beyond the azimuth 
beamwidth, but in elevation it extends between the minimum altitude hcmin (often 
the Earth’s surface) and a maximum altitude hcmax that depends on the origin of the 
scattering particles. When the elevation beam extends beyond those limits, the 
term Rcie/Lp of (3.45) is replaced by an effective cloud thickness:

As the limits expand beyond the elevation beamwidth,   e/Lp. 
For a beam-axis elevation b < e/2 above horizontal, the beamwidth e in 
(3.45) is replaced by the fraction b + e/2 of the beam lying above the surface. 
The fraction of the beam directed at the surface may contribute to the volume clut-
ter energy through an increase in the pattern-propagation factor for the volume 
clutter, as will be discussed in Section 3.4.3. 
As with surface clutter, range ambiguities defined by (3.3) may contain vol-
ume clutter. The resolution cell volumes are proportional to R2
ci, both within and 
beyond the target range R. As noted in Chapter 5, the meteorological radar equa-
tion [6, p. 74, Eq. (4.13)] contains the constant term /(8ln2) = 1/L2
p0 = 0.565, 
consistent with (3.45), where L2
p0 is the two-dimensional beamshape loss for dense 
sampling (see Chapter 5). Literature in which this constant is given as /4 overes-
timates the volume by 1.4 dB because it substitutes the solid angle of a cylindrical 
beam with constant gain over an elliptical region for the beamshape loss that de-
scribes the off-axis reduction in antenna gain in both coordinates.

ume reflectivity is a function of radar frequency as well as the physical properties 
of the scatterers, as described in Chapter 9. In the case of precipitation, insects, 
and chaff corridors, the cloud often extends over many resolution cells in all di-

larger volumes with decreased reflectivity per unit volume.  
3.4.3 
Volume Clutter Energy  
The volume clutter energy is given by (3.4) and (3.5), and the effective value for 
multiple range ambiguities by (3.11). Thus we can write

where the terms with overbars are weighted averages over the cutter region. 
The pattern-propagation factor F 4
ci for volume clutter varies less than for sur-
face clutter. Where the beam is elevated above the horizon, only the pattern varia-
tion over the vertical dimension of the cell affects Fc, and this is included as Lp in 
one term of (3.45). When the surface is illuminated with significant gain, a strong 
lobing structure appears with elevation lobe widths /2hr. The pattern-propagation 
factor F 4
ci, when averaged over the vertical extent of the clutter, then increases the 
clutter energy by a factor

, which is the average value of 
[2sin(2hr/)]4 over elevations 0 < 2hr/ < 2. Significant errors in estimates of 
detection range result when factors of this magnitude are ignored in applying the 
radar equation.  
Volume and surface clutter differ also because a polarization factor Fpc << 1 
may be obtained for precipitation through use of circular polarization (see Section 
10.1.1), and elevated clouds may extend far beyond the surface-clutter horizon, 
producing clutter in multiple ambiguities even when the intended targets are with-
in the unambiguous range. Surface clutter may have similar range extent when 
propagation ducts are present, but the problem is more common with high-altitude 
volume clutter.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
3.4.4 
Volume Clutter Detectability Factor 
The effect of wind shear on volume clutter causes the mean and spread of velocity 
to increase with range. Clutter correlation loss Lcc, described by (3.6) and (3.7), 
applies to volume clutter, but is smaller than for surface clutter because of the 
larger velocity spread v of volume clutter (see Chapter 9). The increasing spread 
reduces Lcc, even in the absence of MTI processing, causing the effective clutter 
spectral density to increase less rapidly with increasing range than would be pre-
dicted solely from the increasing volume in the resolution cell. The pdf of volume 
clutter is approximately Rayleigh, at least over range extents used in cell-
averaging CFAR, giving Lcd  1 in (3.8). The clutter detectability factor Dxc for 
volume clutter, given by (3.9), thus exceeds Dx for noise only by the clutter corre-
lation loss Lcc. 
3.4.5 
Detection Range in Volume Clutter and Noise 
After evaluating clutter volumes, reflectivities, and propagation factors as func-
tions of the target range R, the effective clutter density can be found from (3.11), 
added to the noise density as in (3.2), and inserted as the interference spectral den-
sity I0e, replacing noise density N0 in (1.26), and used in (3.12) to find the maxi-
mum detection range in an environment of volume clutter and noise. As with sur-
face clutter, many terms on the right-hand side of this equation are range-
dependent, and Rmc must generally be found graphically or by root-finding. 
A special case in which an equation for detection range of a LPRF radar may 
be written in closed form applies when the following conditions apply: 
 No range-ambiguous clutter: Rc = R, Lc = L, and Frdrc = Frdr; 
 No surface-reflection lobing: Fc = F = 1; 
 Clutter loss Lcd = 1, and constant Lcc with varying range; 
 Improvement factor Im constant with range; 
 Clutter energy dominates the interference at the processor output: C0e >>N0, 
I0e = C0e. 
Equations (3.45), (3.48), and (3.11) may then be combined to give

Note that the beamshape loss L2
p appears in the numerator, while the correspond-
ing loss for the target is included within Dx in the denominator. In this derivation 
the polarization factors Fp and Fpc are retained because they are not range-
dependent. The antenna polarizations are sometimes chosen for rejection of pre-
cipitation: Fp >> Fpc. However, the other assumptions constrain the solution to a 
limited number of situations. 
A typical example to which this expression applies is shown in Figure 3.7, 
where the X-band radar described in Table 3.1 uses an LPRF waveform, looks 
through a cloud of 1-mm/h rain without MTI but with circular polarization for 
clutter rejection: F 2
pc = 0.01, F 2
p = 0.5. The curve for signal energy lies below that 
shown in Figure 3.2 because of the reduced polarization factor F 2
p for the target 
and increase attenuation in rain. The range scale is logarithmic to illustrate the 
linear dependence of target and clutter energy on R4 and R2, respectively. The 
closed-form (3.53) is applicable because the clutter spectral density at Rmc is some 
35 dB above noise at Rmc.

In this example, no MTI improvement has been shown. It would obviously be 
advantageous to include MTI processing, which could provide about 15-dB clutter 
reduction (see Section 9.6.1), providing target detection near 50 km. 
3.4.6 
Volume Clutter in CW and PD Radars 
Volume clutter in CW radars that use phase modulation to obtain range resolution 
n is described by the expressions given in previous section for pulse radar. The 
cross-range dimension of the resolution cell in azimuth is determined by the 
beamwidth, and in elevation either by the beamwidth or the cloud thickness, as in 
(3.46).  
In unmodulated CW radar, the range dimension of the clutter is the length of 
the path that lies within the cloud. Blake [3, p. 300, Eq. (7.18)] presents an expres-
sion using a triple integral (in range, azimuth, and elevation) to give the clutter 
energy for pulsed radar where v remains constant over a hemisphere, but the ele-
vation limits of the cloud are, in general, range-dependent. 
3.4.6.1 Volume Clutter Energy for CW Radar 
Useful insight into CW radar performance in volume clutter may be gained under 
the assumption that the cloud extends beyond the radar beam in both angle coor-
dinates, for which case the surface-clutter expressions (3.29)–(3.33) can be modi-
fied for volume clutter to yield

Consider again the X-band radar described in Table 3.1, operating in the rain-
fall rate of 1 mm/h assumed for Figure 3.7, but with a CW waveform and circular 
polarization. The clutter density resulting from (3.55) is shown in Figure 3.8. The 
peak density occurs at range Rff, and most of the clutter energy comes from the 
volume within  6Rff in front of the antenna. 
The clutter reflectivity v is usually assumed constant within the cloud, and is 
included in Kcv, but may be moved within the integral of (3.56) if it varies in some

known way with range. Atmospheric attenuation is included within the integral 
because it may become significant for large Rcmin. As with the surface-clutter 
analysis, the factors Frdr and Lcc are assumed unity for CW radar and omitted from 
the equations. 
The range limits of the integral depend on the location and extent of the 
cloud. The minimum range Rcmin approaches zero when the cloud envelopes the 
radar, but the antenna beam is not fully formed within the far-field range of the 
antenna, given by

Here w and h are the width and height of the aperture and K  1.2 is the beam-

quired in most CW radars to avoid direct coupling between the transmitter and 
receiver. Hence the two beams begin to overlap at  Rff/2, and the gain product 
GtGr is realized only beyond Rff.

If Im= 50 dB in our example radar, this gives Rmc = 27.3 km. The variation of de-

combination of changing clutter volume and far-field range, the latter affecting the 
response to nearby clutter.

3.4.6.3 Example of CW Radar in Rain 
For a surface-based X-band CW radar with parameters listed in Table 3.1, with 
circular polarization in 1-mm/h rainfall rate, the received clutter energy given by 
(3.60) is C0 = 9  1014 J. An improvement factor Im = 60 dB would reduce the 
effective clutter spectral density to C0 = 9  1020 W/Hz, compared to thermal 
noise with density N0 = 1.4  1020 W/Hz. The resulting C0e/N0 = 8.2 dB is high 
enough to permit (3.63) to be used to find an approximate range:

The accurate range is slightly less, because 8.2 dB  is not quite high enough to 
allow noise to be neglected. The result is independent of the beam elevation, be-
cause the clutter arises within a few hundred meters from the antenna. The results 
given above are based on Im = 60 dB, F 2
pc = 0.01, and F 2
p = 0.5, for circularly po-
larized antennas having the same sense (e.g., right-hand polarization for both 
transmitting and receiving). Much larger Im values are generally available in CW 
radar designed for use against aircraft targets: values in excess of 100 dB were 
shown necessary in Section 3.3.5 for rejection of surface clutter. That level of 
Doppler performance would preserve the thermal-noise detection performance 
when operating in rain, even without the use of circular polarization. 
3.4.6.4 Volume Clutter Energy for PD Radar 
Volume clutter energy for pulsed Doppler radar may be found using (3.49), but 
when several range ambiguities are occupied by clutter it may be easier to apply 
the CW radar equations with a correction for the effects of duty cycle and pulse 
compression. The clutter, when averaged over all range gates in the pulse repeti-
tion interval (PRI), is given by adding duty cycle Du as a factor in the numerator 
of Kcv in (3.28) and (3.56)–(3.58). The pulse compression ratio /n is applied to 
the denominator of Kcv when a modulated pulse is used. The factor of 2 in the nu-
merator of (3.57) is omitted in calculating the far-field range of PD radar anten-
nas, because the transmitting and receiving beams are formed by the common 
antenna at a range Rff = wh/ and the beams coincide at all ranges. The resulting 
expression for average PD volume clutter energy, when the cloud envelopes the 
radar, becomes:

This average clutter energy is added to the noise spectral density to obtain I0e for 
use in calculating an average detection range from (3.12).  
The clutter density as a function of range is shown in Figure 3.7 with adjust-
ment for duty cycle, pulse compression, and aliasing at the unambiguous range Ru. 
The clutter competing with the target varies about that average, as shown in Fig-
ure 3.9. The maximum value lies in the first gate that includes the range Rff where 
the beam is fully formed. Clutter in that gate is  65 dB above noise level, requir-
ing an improvement factor Im > 75 dB to avoid reduction in target detectability.

 Ambiguous ranges Rci at which clutter competes with the target at range R, 
from (3.3), and the corresponding volumes Vci from (3.45). 
 Volume clutter reflectivity vi for each area, using data from Chapter 9. 
 Volume pattern-propagation factor Fci, integrated over the resolution cell, and 
atmospheric attenuation Lci for each volume, using data from Chapter 8. 
 Clutter cross sections from (3.48) and the resulting clutter input density from 
(3.5) for clutter ranges Rci. 
 Clutter correlation loss Lcci, based on number of independent clutter samples 
available for integration from (3.6), using data on clutter velocity spread vi 
for each ambiguity, from Chapter 9, and accounting for Doppler improve-
ment factor Imi when such processing is used. 
 Effective clutter spectral density C0e from (3.11), with Ccd = 1, based on 
summation of effective clutter energies from any ambiguities, from (3.56) for 
CW radar or from (3.66) for PD radar. 
 Effective interference spectral density I0e from (3.2). 
 Detection range Rmc from (3.12). 
When both surface and volume clutter are present at the same range, the cal-
culation of Doppler improvement Imi must consider the differing velocities of the 
two clutter components. The effective clutter spectral density components C0e 
from the two clutter sources are added to that of noise to find detection range.  
3.5 
EFFECTS OF DISCRETE CLUTTER 
Two types of discrete clutter cause problems in radar that differ from the surface 
and volume clutter discussed in the previous sections:  
 Echoes from moving objects such as birds or land vehicles;  
 Large echoes from fixed objects on the surface, primarily manmade struc-
tures.  
Radial velocities of moving objects may lie in the response band of Doppler pro-
cessors and be passed to the output as targets, overloading the traffic capacity of 
human operators or track-while-scan channels. Echoes from large fixed objects 
may exceed the cancellation capability of the signal processor, producing visible 
clutter or alarms that impede detection and tracking of desired targets. The dis-
crete nature of these echoes prevents their rejection by cell-averaging CFAR de-
tectors, and other means of rejection may raise the threshold to levels that sup-

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming

press target detection in several resolution cells including and surrounding that 
containing the strong clutter. 
Models of both types of discrete clutter are discussed in Chapter 9, along with 
processing methods for its rejection. The effect of discrete clutter is not measured 
by a reduction in maximum detection range Rm on the desired targets. Instead, if 
not adequately suppressed in the signal processor, the false-alarm probability is 
increased, placing a burden on subsequent data processing. Adequate clutter sup-
pression is inevitably accompanied by decreased target detection probability in 
some fraction of the coverage area, caused by increased loss of the signal in the 
suppression process.  
3.5.1 
Effect of False Alarms 
In a track-while-scan or multifunction radar system, the data processor assigns a 
tracking channel to attempt track initiation at the location of an alarm that is not 
correlated with an existing track file. This channel is occupied for several scans 
after the alarm. For reliable track initiation, the number of tracking channels nch in 
the data processing system must be increased beyond the number ntr of actual tar-
gets present:

Ac =

m/2 =  surface area covered by scanning an azimuth sector to range Rm.  
The first term on the right-hand side of (3.67) is the number of target tracks ex-
pected, the second is the average number of tracking channels consumed in at-
tempts to validate and acquire track on noise alarms, and the third is the average 
number of channels consumed by similar attempts on discrete clutter. When track-
ing at out to an instrumented range Rinst > Rm is desired on targets having large 
RCS, the range Rinst replaces Rm in (3.67).  
3.5.2 
Required Noise False-Alarm Probability 
To avoid excessive burden on the data processor, Pfa is normally set so that the 
second term in (3.67) is a small fraction of the first. For example, if the maximum 

90 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
number of targets expected is ntr = 100, Pfa is set to make the second term < 10 
channels. Noise alarms are uncorrelated and widely scattered in the search sector, 
so the number of track initiation attempts following a noise alarm can be limited 
to ntin = 2. Thus, in our example, about five noise alarms are allowable per scan: 
nrnazPfa  5. In a typical search radar scanning 360, nr = 2,000 and naz = 200, giv-
ing nrnaz = 4  105 resolution cells in the search sector, and requiring Pfa  5/nrnaz 
= 1.25  105. Use of higher resolution in search requires reduction in Pfa, increas-
ing the required signal-to-noise ratio. 
3.5.3 
Requirements for Rejection of Discrete Clutter  
The third term in (3.67) must be controlled by design of the signal processor. 
Since clutter alarms are correlated from scan to scan, attempted track initiation or 
recognition of a fixed echo typically requires ntic = 5 scans after a clutter alarm. 
Accordingly, np  2 clutter alarms per scan are permitted, if the track processor 
load for discrete clutter is to be less that 10 channels.  
An important point in design of track-while-scan and multifunction radar sys-
tems is that every detectable target within the surveillance coverage must either be 
assigned a track file or placed in a clutter map. Otherwise there will be repeated 
alarms requiring attempts at track initiation. Bird statistics are such that most de-
tections result from upward fluctuations of echoes whose average is too low to 
provide reliable tracking or mapping. Only discrimination using differences be-
tween target and bird RCS, altitude, or true velocity can avoid random false 
alarms from loading the data processor. Shrader [7, p. 2.87] describes a sensitivi-
ty-velocity control (SVC) system that combines measurements of RCS and true 
(unambiguous) radial velocity to perform this discrimination, using PRF diversity 
over several CPIs. He suggests that it is most applicable to radars operating below 
1.4 GHz. For radar frequencies in the UHF or lower bands, most birds lie in the 
Rayleigh region where RCS varies as f0
4, reducing the number of detectable ob-
jects. Operation in these low bands also discriminates against low-altitude objects, 
but these may include targets as well as birds and land vehicles. 
Data from Table 9.3 show that metropolitan areas have fixed clutter sources 
exceeding +40 dBsm with densities up to  0.2 per km2. The maximum range hav-
ing such density is typically Rcmax = 20 km. The area within 20 km over a 360 
scan is some 1,250 km2, and so 250 clutter points exceeding +40 dBsm may be 
expected. Virtually all of these must be prevented from sending alarms to the data 
processor.  
Suppression of fixed discrete clutter cannot be provided by cell-averaging 
CFAR threshold control, since the cells containing the clutter are scattered over 
the search area. Suppression must be provided by some combination of velocity 
discrimination and clutter mapping in the signal processor, as described in Section 
9.6.5. Table 9.3 is based on data gathered prior to deployment of wind turbines 

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
91 
(Section 9.4.4), which combine large RCS, fixed locations, and large Doppler 
shifts. Clutter mapping appears to offer a solution to this type of fixed clutter. 
3.5.4 
Summary of Discrete Clutter Effects 
The is no equation that describes the effect of discrete clutter on radar detection 
range. Discrete clutter controls the design of the signal processor, and the resulting 
processor losses are included in calculating the effective detectability factor Dx. 
High-resolution clutter maps offer a means of suppressing strong fixed clutter 
points at the expense of suppressing some fraction of target detections. To the 
extent discrete clutter passes the signal processor, the subsequent data processor 
must be designed to handle tracking loads greater than the number of targets actu-
ally present in the surveillance area, to avoid saturation that would result in failure 
to respond to actual target detections. 
3.6 
SIDELOBE CLUTTER 
The ratio of mainlobe-to-sidelobe antenna gain is normally high enough that 
sidelobe clutter at the receiver input is negligible, relative to the mainlobe clutter 
discussed in previous sections. There are two cases, however, in which sidelobe 
clutter may become important: 
 When the improvement factor for mainlobe clutter is much larger than that 
available for sidelobe clutter, due to relative motion of the radar and clutter; 
 When the ratio of two-way mainlobe to sidelobe gain is insufficient to place 
the total sidelobe clutter power below that of the mainlobe. 
Equations applicable to these situations are discussed here for both surface 
and volume clutter. 
3.6.1 
Surface Clutter in Sidelobes 
The surface area contributing to clutter in the azimuth sidelobes is much larger 
than that given by (3.18), because the sidelobe sector (including backlobes) ex-
tends over (  a)   radians from the beam axis. The clutter area Ac is a ring 
of radius Rccos centered on the surface immediately below the radar. The area is 
larger by a factor  2Lp/a than that within the mainlobe:

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The two-way pattern-propagation factor F 4
cs applicable to clutter within this area is 
reduced by the ratio (G/Gs)2 relative to F 4
c for mainlobe clutter, where Gs is the 
power gain of the azimuth sidelobes, averaged over the 2 radian ring. The far-
sidelobe gain for a typical antenna is Gs   10 dB relative to an isotropic antenna. 
A typical result, for a fan-beam surveillance radar antenna with mainlobe gain 
G = +30 dB and a = 2, is: 
 
 
Acs/Ac = 360/a = 180 = +22.6 dB;

c = 108 = 80 dB; 
 
 
csF 4
cs/cF 4
c = 1.8  106 = 57.4 dB. 
This would justify neglecting the sidelobe clutter for the typical antenna in cases 
where the mainlobe improvement factor Im < 57 dB. For land-based radars, the 
spectral spreading of the sidelobe and mainlobe clutter would be equal, and both 
would be reduced by Doppler processing. 
3.6.1.1 Sidelobe Clutter in Moving Pulsed Doppler Radars 
Radars using pulsed Doppler processing often achieve mainlobe clutter improve-
ment factors Im > 60 dB, using rejection notch widths that encompass the velocity 
spread of mainlobe clutter. When the velocity of the radar over the surface ap-
proaches or exceeds the notch width, however, Im drops rapidly toward 0 dB, and 
sidelobe clutter may dominate the interference. This is the situation in shipboard 
radars using low-PRF pulsed Doppler waveforms (e.g., the moving target detec-
tor, MTD), and in airborne radars using pulsed Doppler waveforms at any PRF.  
In the case of airborne MPRF and HPRF radars, the sidelobe-clutter problem 
is exacerbated by the presence of multiple range ambiguities, some at ranges 
much less than that of the target. Spectra of clutter in such radars appears as 
shown in Figure 3.10. For the MPRF radar, clutter occupies the entire velocity 
space, and detection of targets outside the mainlobe region is possible only if the 
sidelobe clutter spectral density is below the energy of the target by the required 
detectability factor Dx. With the HPRF waveform, although the clutter level is 
higher (because of the larger number of range ambiguities and their shorter range), 
a clear Doppler region exists in which detection above the noise level is possible. 
3.6.1.2 Sidelobe Clutter in Low-Gain Antennas 
Radar systems can be designed in which a broad-beam transmitting antenna illu-
minates a large area on the surface, within which the gain of narrow receiving 
beams and integration over long periods compensates for loss of transmitting gain. 
In the limit, the transmitting antenna pattern may be uniform in azimuth, and 
sidelobe clutter in the receiving beam is reduced only by the one-way sidelobe 
ratio G/Gs. In this case, the calculation of the ratio of sidelobe to mainlobe clutter, 

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
93 
for the typical receiving antenna used in the example of the previous section, 
would have the following values: 
 
 
Acs/Ac = 360/a = 180 = +22.6 dB; 
 
 
F 4
cs/F 4
c = 104 = 40 dB; 
 
 
csF 4
cs/cF 4
c = 0.018 = 17.4 dB. 
If the radar were moving with respect to the surface, the clutter improvement fac-
tor for the sidelobe clutter might well be insufficient to keep that clutter below the 
mainlobe clutter at the processor output, and application of (3.4) and (3.5) would 
require that ciF 4
ci include both the mainlobe and sidelobe clutter areas, with dif-
ferent improvement factors applied to these two components in (3.10) 
3.6.2 
Volume Clutter in Sidelobes 
The volume contributing to clutter in the antenna sidelobes is much larger than 
that given by (3.45), since the sidelobe sector (including backlobes) extends over 
the entire hemisphere of 2 steradians about the beam axis (or 4 steradians for 
airborne radars). Precipitation clutter in the upper elevation sidelobes of surface-
based radars is limited in range by the upper altitude limit hcmax of the cloud, be-
low which the volume Vc is:

For example, for a pencil-beam antenna with a = e = 2 = 0.035 rad, if we as-
sume hcmax = 3 km and Rc = 30 km, the volume ratio is 
 
Vcs/Vc = hcmaxL2
p0/Rcae = 620 = +27.9 dB. 
The mainlobe gain of this antenna is G = 6,700 = +38.3 dB, and for an rms 
sidelobe level Gs   10 dB relative to an isotropic antenna, we find:

c = 108 = 96.5 dB; 
 
 
csF 4
cs/cF 4
c = 1.15  106 = 59.4 dB. 
This justifies neglecting the sidelobe clutter for typical pencil-beam antennas, ex-
cept in cases where the mainlobe clutter is subject to an improvement factor that is 
more than 59 dB greater than available for the sidelobe clutter. The velocity spec-
trum of precipitation clutter in sidelobes, with wind speed vw, would extend over 
vw and would not be expected to permit Im as great as for mainlobe clutter. 
With a transmitting beam that has uniform gain in azimuth, the pattern-
propagation factor ratio becomes 48.3 dB, and a system with Im > 17 dB would 
have to consider sidelobe volume clutter if its velocity spread placed it outside the 
clutter notch. 
Chaff clutter would not normally extend over the entire sidelobe region, but if 
it did the procedure would be the same as for precipitation.

DETECTION IN NOISE JAMMING 
3.7.1 
Objective and Methods of Noise Jamming 
Noise jamming is intended to mask the target, preventing its detection. Its effect is 
evaluated by including in the radar equation the effective jamming spectral densi-
ty J0e as a component of the interference I0e.  

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming

3.7.1.1 Support Jamming 
Noise jamming is primarily a support jamming technique [8, p. 11], in which the 
jammer is carried by a vehicle separated from the target to be protected. The jam-
ming vehicle can be located at a range Rj from the victim radar beyond that of the 
target: Rj > R (stand-off jammer, SOJ); near the target: Rj  R (escort support 
jammer, ESJ); or within the target range: Rj < R (stand-in jammer). The jammer is 
usually separated in angle from the target to lie in the sidelobes of a radar beam 
that illuminates the target. Jammer power is generally such that the radar is unable 
to measure the range of the jamming vehicle. Accurate angle data on the jammer 
are available, however, and these may be combined with data from other radar 
sites to locate the jammer by triangulation. 
The support jammer is normally assigned to protect targets from several 
search or fire control radars, and hence must cover more than one radar frequency, 
often in different radar bands. To ensure this protection, barrage noise jamming 
that covers the tunable bandwidths of all victim radars is commonly used. When 
the available jammer power is insufficient for this mode of operation, the jammer 
may be controlled by an intercept receiver that measures the radar waveforms ac-
tually in use and assigns spot jamming that covers the bandwidth B of each radar 
signal. This mode requires periodic look-through periods [8, pp. 133–135] in 
which the jamming is discontinued long enough to intercept new or retuned radar 
threats. The so-called smart jammer also uses angle data from the intercept re-
ceiver system to direct high-gain jamming beams at each victim, reducing the 
power requirement while ensuring penetration of the radar sidelobes. 
3.7.1.2 Self-Screening Jammer (SSJ) 
Noise is not normally effective for self-screening, because it ensures detection of a 
target of interest along the jamming strobe produced by the large increase in noise 
as the mainlobe of the radar scans past the jammer. Even without range data from 
an individual radar, strobe angles can be used by the defense system to engage 
jamming vehicles within range of a weapon (e.g., using home-on-jam missiles).  
An SSJ approach using noise is cover-pulse jamming [8, p. 145; 9, p. 227]. 
The noise power is increased gradually, at a time within the victim radar PRI that 
precedes arrival of the radar pulse at the target, to a level that increases the radar 
CFAR threshold (or AGC level) to suppress the target echo. The level is decreased 
again after arrival of the pulse. When properly implemented, the radar operator (or 
automatic detection circuitry) may be unable recognize that jamming has oc-
curred, precluding generation of a jam strobe that provides angle data on the jam-
ming vehicle. The jammer must be able to intercept the radar signal, measure the 
PRI, and respond at a time and with a noise burst of duration adequate to cover 
any variation in PRI from that previously intercepted. Thus the technique requires 
knowledge of the victim radar PRI, and is applicable when radars depend for de-

tection on integration of multiple pulses during a dwell, or when single-pulse 
dwells at almost equal intervals occur during scanning or multiple-target tracking. 
3.7.2 
Radar Equations for Noise Jamming 
The radar equation can be used to determine the range at which a target can be 
detected in a given jamming environment, or the jammer power required to defeat 
detection at a given range.  
3.7.2.1 Description of Jammer 
The noise jammer is characterized by the following parameters: 
Pj 
=  transmitter power in W; 
Gj 
 =  jammer antenna gain; 
Qj 
 =  jamming noise quality factor; 
Fj 
=  jammer-to-radar pattern-propagation factor; 
Fpj 
=  jammer-to-radar polarization factor; 
Bj 
=  noise bandwidth in Hz; 
Ltj 
= 
jammer transmission line loss; 
Rj 
=  jammer range from radar in m; 
Lj 
=  jammer-to-radar (one-way) atmospheric attenuation; 
Llensj = 
jammer-to-radar (one-way) lens loss. 
The effective radiated power (ERP) of the jammer is given by

ERP is a rough measure of jammer capability, but the other parameters listed must

defined:

(3.72) 
The jamming noise quality factor Qj describes the ability of the jammer emis-
sion to affect target detection. Ideally the noise jammer waveform is white Gauss-
ian noise covering the radar signal bandwidth B, and J0e = J0. Transmission of true 
Gaussian noise requires that the peak power rating of the final amplifier exceed Pj 
by 7–10 dB [8, pp. 129–133]. To economize on size and weight, the amplifier is 
normally operated in the saturated mode, and frequency modulation over Bj > B is 
used to approximate the effect of Gaussian noise in the victim receiver. The effec-

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
97 
tive noise density is then given by Q jJ0, where typical values of Qj are in the 
range 0.3–0.6 (5 to 2 dB). 
The jammer-to-radar pattern-propagation factor Fj is the ratio of the jamming 
field amplitude produced at the radar antenna to the amplitude that would be pro-
duced if the radar were on the axis of the jammer antenna beam in the absence of 
reflection or obstruction by the jamming platform or its surroundings. The product 
GjF j
2 thus represents the jammer antenna power gain in the direction of the radar. 
Except in the smart jammer with directional response along the measured angle of 
intercepted signals, the beamwidth of the jammer antenna must be broad enough 
to cover all the assigned victim radars, and the antenna must have a clear path in 
the direction to the radar. Gains of 3–5 dB are typical, implying broad beams for 
which Fj falls off slowly with off-axis angle.  
The jamming received by the radar antenna depends on the product 
GjF j
2GrF r
2 of the effective jammer and radar antenna gains along the jammer-to-
radar path, where the radar receiving pattern-propagation factor Fr, introduced in 
(1.16), describes departure from the on-axis, free-space receiving antenna gain. 
The effect of sidelobe cancellation (SLC) or adaptive array nulling in the radar is 
to reduce the receiving voltage gain pattern that enters into Fr. Ideally this will 
decrease Fr to place the jamming at or below the level of thermal noise. Practical 
SLC implementation limits the reduction to 15–20 dB relative to the basic 
sidelobe level of the antenna. 
The polarization factor Fpj is the ratio of received jamming voltage to that of 
an antenna to which the jammer is matched. Among several radars in a band, more 
than one receiving polarization may be used. To avoid encountering a radar that is 
insensitive to the polarization of the jammer, the jammer antenna polarization is 
typically circular, or linear at 45 from the vertical. The resulting polarization 
factor is F 2
pj = 0.5 = 3 dB for any linearly or circularly polarized radar antenna. If 
the known types of victim radar antennas include circular polarization (e.g., for 
rain rejection), using the 45 linearly polarized jammer antenna option would 
avoid possible orthogonal polarization. 
The jamming bandwidth Bj is determined by the assigned mission. For bar-
rage jamming, it is typically 5%–10% of the center frequency of the assigned ra-
dar band, while for spot jamming it is slightly greater than the bandwidth B of the 
intercepted signal, to allow for errors in measurement. 
The one-way atmospheric attenuation and lens factor for the jammer are cal-
culated by methods described in Chapter 7, using one-half the decibel values cal-
culated for the two-way radar-target path at the same range.

Examples of Noise Jamming  
3.7.3.1 Barrage Jamming  
Consider the barrage jammer parameters listed in Table 3.3, operating at Rj = 150 
km against the example radar of Table 3.1, several of which may lie in the operat-

ing area and be assigned as victims for the jammer. The targets to be protected by 
the jamming have 1-m2 RCS, and in the absence of jamming are detectable with 
Pd = 50% at Rm = 93 km from the radar, where the single-sample SNR = Dx  20 
dB. It is desired to find the number of jammers required mask these targets at 
Rmj = 40 km from the radar. The pattern-propagation factor Fj = 25 dB shown in 
the table results from jamming through major radar antenna sidelobes, with some 
allowance for radars that are not on the axis of the jammer antenna mainlobe. No 
sidelobe cancellation is assumed.

where Tj/Ts is given by the fourth power of the range ratio, multiplied by the ratio 
of atmospheric and lens losses for the radar at Rm to those losses at Rmj. The input 
noise temperature Ts = 1,000K in this example must be increased by a factor of 
37 = 15.5 dB to obtain the range reduction factor of 93/30. The required jamming 
temperature can be compared to the temperature for a single barrage jammer of

Four jammers are required to provide adequate masking. If the jammers are car-
ried by aircraft orbiting on a racetrack course at Rj = 100 km with selectable an-
tennas on either side of each aircraft, five aircraft and jammers would be required, 
four to maintain the screen while a fifth performs a 180 turn to maintain its orbit. 
The high power and number of jammers shows the problem in barrage jamming of 
multiple radars. 
3.7.3.2 Spot Jamming  
Spot jamming based on signal intercepts from periodic look-through is an option, 
because the victim radars used as in the example in the preceding section require 
multiple-pulse integration for detection. The jammer parameters of Table 3.3 
would apply, except that emission would be concentrated in several narrow bands 
(e.g., 10 MHz each) identified by the intercepts. If there were five such bands, the 
total bandwidth would be Bj = 50 MHz instead of 500 MHz, increasing the jam-
ming density by a factor of 10: 
 
Tj1 = 105K  
The screening for a single 1-kW jammer would be effective to range Rmj  31 km, 
or Pj = 370W would suffice, assuming that the jammer antenna could cover con-
tinuously the azimuth sector occupied by the radars.  
Spot jamming becomes difficult if each radar uses frequency diversity to 
force the jammer to cover many spot frequencies in the band. Pulse-to-pulse fre-
quency agility forces a return to barrage jamming, but precludes implementation 
of MTI by the radars. This suggests the advantage of combining passive ECM 
(chaff) with active jamming, to force the radar to use bursts of coherent pulses 
subject to interception and spot jamming. 
3.7.3.3 Self-Screening Noise Jamming  
Relatively low powers provide self-screening on the axis of the radar mainlobe 
(Fj = 1). The effect of the 1-kW jammer in Section 3.7.3.1 can be produced with 
3W jammer power in the mainlobe. A special range equation gives the 
burnthrough range for this case:

where n is the number of coherent outputs integrated following envelope detec-

(3.75) and setting Rbt = Rmj = Rj.

range of the example radar is

A smaller jammer with Pj = 10W and Gj = 3.2 = 5 dB still achieves a burnthrough 
range of 31 km, adequate for most operations against the example radar. These 
ranges are obtained with barrage noise covering 500 MHz.  
The preceding calculations apply also to a self-screening noise jammer using 
the cover-pulse technique. The noise power Pj is the level after the jammer has 
reached its full output. In a typical case, the duty cycle of such a jammer would be 
 10% for each radar being jammed, and the average power would be correspond-
ingly lower. This type of jammer adjusts its output power based on the level of 
received pulses in order to minimize the chances that a jam strobe would be gen-
erated. If implemented using a digital RF memory (DRFM), the noise bandwidth 
would also be restricted to spot jamming centered on the radar frequency, making 
it possible to use very low power levels that would further reduce the probability 
of jam-strobe generation.  
3.8 
DECEPTIVE JAMMING 
In deceptive jamming (also called deceptive ECM or DECM), the emissions are 
designed to appear as radar echoes at locations where no target actually exists. 
The purpose is to introduce confusion into the radar system and the network that 
uses the radar data, and possibly to saturate the data processor to impede or pre-
vent reliable tracking of actual targets. There are two types of deceptive jammers 
[9, p. 86]:  
Transponder jammers generate noncoherent returns that emulate the temporal characteristics 
of the actual radar return. Repeaters generate coherent returns that attempt to emulate the am-
plitude, frequency, and temporal characteristics of the actual radar return.  
The repeater jammer has become the preferred method for creating synthetic tar-
gets that are realistic enough to pass from the radar processor into the data stream. 

102 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
This type of jammer includes an intercept receiver, a memory to store features of 
the radar waveform, and a modulated transmitter in which the radar waveform is 
regenerated with time delays and Doppler shifts that correspond to false target 
positions and velocities.  
Deceptive jammers are used extensively against tracking radars that are ele-
ments of a fire-control system. Their use in this application is designed to prevent 
the fire control radar from locking on the target, or to break lock if the radar has 
already locked on. A number of sophisticated techniques are available for this 
purpose, the success of which generally requires the transmission of the selected 
jamming waveform at high very jamming-to-signal ratios. The evaluation of the 
effectiveness of this type of jamming does not generally lend itself to analysis, and 
testing using the actual radar and jamming equipment (or hardware simulators) is 
usually required. 
The current technology for waveform storage is the digital RF memory 
(DRFM). The operation of this device is described in [9, Chapter 5], and will not 
be repeated here. The state of the art has advanced steadily, providing the ability 
to store and regenerate most radar signals with adequate accuracy and with con-
trollable time delays and Doppler shifts. The accompanying intercept receiver is 
also implemented digitally [10].  
A significant challenge to repeater jamming is the presence of multiple radar 
signals that overlap in time and have large time-bandwidth products. This causes 
cross-products to appear in the jammer output when overlapping signals are pro-
cessed through nonlinear circuits in the repeater. 
3.8.1 
Range Equations for Deceptive Jamming 
Deceptive jammers operate by responding to individual pulses received from the 
radar, with time delay, Doppler shift, or modulations that prevent proper operation 
of the radar or interpretation of its data. The applicable range equations are based 
on single-pulse peak power level rather than energy levels over a CPI.  
3.8.1.1 Transponder Equations 
A transponder is used to generate false targets in a radar that uses noncoherent 
integration (as opposed to a pulsed Doppler process). The transponder response is 
triggered by an incoming pulse from the radar, but is generated by an RF source 
that does not maintain phase coherence with the received pulse. The transponder 
is characterized by the following parameters: 
Gj = jammer antenna gain; 
Fpj = jammer-to-radar polarization factor; 
Fj = jammer-to-radar pattern-propagation factor; 
Flensj = jammer-to-radar (one-way) lens factor. 

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
103 
Sminj = transponder sensitivity in W;7 
Pj = peak response power in W; 
Lj = transmission or reception line loss; 
Lj = jammer-to-radar (one-way) atmospheric attenuation; 
It is assumed here that the antenna gain and patterns and the line losses are identi-
cal for transmitting and receiving, and that the response pulsewidth is the same as 
that of the radar transmission. 
For a radar with ERP = PtGt/Lt, the range Rrt at which a transponder response 
is triggered is found as

where Smin r is the minimum single-pulse signal power at the radar for given detec-

As an example, consider the radar described in Table 3.1, transmitting 1-s 
pulses, and transponder characteristic listed in Table 3.4. The pattern-propagation 
factor F 2
j = 30 dB is chosen to allow response in the radar’s sidelobe region. The 
sensitivity is typical of a receiver using a low-noise RF amplifier followed by a 
square-law detector and video amplifier [8, p. 429]. 
                                                           
7  The usual transponder specification gives the tangential sensitivity, corresponding to a signal-to-
noise ratio of +4 dB at the input of a square-law detector [8, p. 427]. For reliable triggering, Smin j 
should be several decibels above that level. Receiver sensitivity is commonly specified in dBm 
(decibels with respect to 1 mW).

3.8.1.2 Repeater Equations 
The repeater differs from the transponder in that it accepts the signal received with 
antenna gain Gj, amplifies it with electronic gain Ge, and retransmits it with anten-
na gain Gj, and usually with duty cycle Du < 0.5 to avoid self-oscillation. Design 
of the repeater is based on responding with a power representing a target with 
radar cross section e, viewed by the radar mainlobe at range Rj.  
Radar cross section may be considered in terms of an equivalent sphere of ra-
dius r having projected area r2. Scattering from the sphere is isotropic, so the 
RCS may be regarded as the product of the projected area and an isotropic gain

which must also overcome RF losses Ljr and Ljt within the repeater, in the pattern-
propagation factors Fjr and Fjt of the receiving and transmitting paths, and in their 
polarization factors Fpjr and Fpjt. Assuming equal gains and losses for receiving 
and transmitting, and use of gating with duty cycle Du to isolate the receiver from 
the transmitter, the required electronic gain Ge, as derived in [8, p. 424], is

The second form of (3.86) replaces L from [8] with the two-way RF loss within 
the repeater and the two-way polarization and pattern-propagation factors. The 
factor F j
4 is included on the assumption that a repeater located off the axis of the 
radar beam, and possibly in the radar sidelobes, is intended to reproduce the signal 
power that would result from an on-axis target with RCS equal to e.  
An escort repeater located in a region of 30 dB sidelobes, with the same pa-
rameters as were used for the transponder example, Table 3.4, requires a very 
large electronic gain:

A stand-off repeater would require even greater gain to account for the ratio 
(Rj/R)4. Gains of this sort would apply, for example, to escort or stand-off DRFM 
jammers. The signal power received from the example radar at Rj = 100 km is 
58.4 dBm, and the RF receiver gain brings this to a level high enough to drive 
the DRFM. The DRFM is followed by A/D conversion and sufficient RF transmit-
ter gain to raise the analog signal to the required output power of 12.6W = +41 
dBm. Introduction of time gating and delay between intercept and transmission of 
the signal prevents self-oscillation. 
For a self-protection repeater (Fj = 1) the required electronic gain is +39.5 dB 
(input signal 25.8 dBm, output power +13.7 dBm). Additional gain would be 
required to overcome the duty-cycle loss inherent in a self-protection jammer, 
since it cannot isolate the output from the input with gating and time delay, and 
must operate as a straight-through repeater.  
Note that these range equations do not describe limits to radar detection 
range, but rather jammer requirements that allow the radar to trigger and receive 
the deceptive emission. The effect on the radar depends on factors other than 
range equations.

SUMMARY OF DETECTION IN JAMMING 
3.9.1 
Range with Noise Jamming 
Noise jamming is used for masking of targets, and is usually generated by a sup-
port jammer. The steps in calculating detection range are as follows. 
 The jamming noise density J0 is calculated from (3.73). 
 The jamming density J0 is converted to an effective value by applying the 
jamming quality factor Qj, according to (3.74) 
 The equivalent jamming temperature Tj is found by dividing J0e by Boltz-
mann’s constant, according to (3.75). 
 If more than one jammer is present, their noise temperatures are summed and 
added to the system temperature to find the total input noise temperature Ts, 
according to (3.76). 
 The maximum detection range is found by substitution of Ts for Ts in (1.26). 
When noise is used for self-screening, these steps are replaced by calculations 
of a burnthrough range from (3.79).  
3.9.2 
Deceptive Jammer Equations 
The jammer sensitivity, gain, and output power required for deceptive jamming 
are given by (3.80)(3.86). Radar detection range on targets is affected only if the 
deceptive jamming distracts the operator or automatic circuitry from otherwise 
detectable signals. 
3.10 
DETECTION IN COMBINED INTERFERENCE 
The range equations given for special cases in preceding sections apply to combi-
nations of jamming and thermal noise. When clutter is present as well, at the rang-
es where target detection is required, it is necessary to calculate the effective spec-
tral densities of the several interference components and add these to find, at each 
range, effective total interference level I0e from (3.2). That level then replaces N0 = 
kTs in (1.26) or similar equations for maximum detection range. The definitions of 
effective interference spectral density take into account the properties of the signal 
processor, so there is no need to make further adjustment for “processing gain” or 
other factors sometimes appearing in the literature. 
The constraints imposed by multiple, simultaneous interference components 
on the choice of waveform and processing method must not be ignored, however. 

 
Radar Equations for Clutter and Jamming 
107 
Measures that improve the performance with one type of interference often in-
crease vulnerability to others. A notable example is the combination of active 
jamming with chaff or natural clutter. Use of frequency agility to overcome spot 
jamming is precluded by presence of any type of clutter at the required detection 
range (or its ambiguities), since Doppler processing for clutter rejection requires 
waveforms that maintain coherence over the coherent processing interval (CPI). 
Responsive jammers can measure the signal properties on pulses early in each CPI 
and achieve masking by responding to subsequent pulses.  
Another constraint is imposed by presence of clutter at ranges both within and 
beyond the unambiguous range of the waveform. While there is a theoretical po-
tential for cancellation of multiple-time-around clutter with staggered PRI wave-
forms, uniform-PRI waveforms are required in practice. Coherent processing must 
start only after clutter from the longest ranges has entered the receiver. If blind 
speeds exist within the spectrum of potential targets, PRI diversity from one pulse 
group to the next is necessary to fill those gaps, increasing the required dwell 
time. This imposes a burden especially on scanning-beam radars that perform 
search scans within tightly constrained time budgets.  
Waveform and processor requirements for different environments are dis-
cussed in Chapter 9.

CHAPTER 4 
Detection Theory  
The first step in derivation of the radar equation in Chapter 1 was to express 
through (1.9) the ratio E/N0 of signal-to-noise energy available at target range R. 
The second step expressed the ratio required for each of n pulses to achieve target 
detection. For an idealized radar we call this value, denoted by D(n), the basic 
detectability factor: the signal-to-noise ratio derived from the theory of target de-
tection before application of losses encountered in practical radar systems. The 
maximum range Rm is that at which E/N0 = D(n). This chapter summarizes meth-
ods of calculating D(n) for different radar waveforms and target models. Chapters 
5, 9, and 10 discuss the losses that increase the requirement for input energy ratio 
from D(n) to Dx(n), the effective detectability factor that must be used in a com-
plete radar equation such as (1.22).  
4.1 
BACKGROUND 
Blake [1] summarizes the refinement of the radar range equation at the Naval Re-
search Laboratory in years following WWII. He defines the visibility factor V0 as 
the single-pulse signal-to-noise energy ratio E/N0 required to obtain a specified 
probability of detection Pd when n pulses are integrated on a cathode-ray-tube 
display for visual detection by a human operator. He generalizes this to the detect-
ability factor D(n) for radars in which integration and detection is performed elec-
tronically or digitally. This factor appears in (1.16) and other simplified forms of 
the radar equation. It represents a theoretical value for each of n pulses received 
with equal power, passed through a matched filter along with white Gaussian 
noise, envelope detected, integrated noncoherently with equal weights, and ap-
plied to the detection threshold. 

110 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Because the idealized radar receiver is matched to the signal spectrum, the 
signal-to-noise power ratio S/N delivered to the envelope detector equals the ener-
gy ratio E/N0 at the radar input. The detectability factor D(n) is expressed by theo-
retical equations that are based on S/N at the input to the envelope detector.  
Exact equations have been developed giving the detection probability for sev-
eral statistical target models. These equations are complex, requiring numerical 
integration or reference to special tabulated functions. As a result, much of the 
literature on radar detection is devoted to development of approximations that 
permit quick calculation of Pd for given signal-to-noise power ratio S/N, and vice 
versa, avoiding the theoretical equations required for exact solutions. Many pages 
(and an entire book) of graphs have been published showing Pd as a function of 
S/N, for different target models and with specific values of Pfa and n. The graphs 
provide insight into the effects on detection of different radar and target character-
istics, but numerical values with adequate accuracy for use in the radar equation 
are best found by solving the underlying equations, either exactly or approximate-
ly.  
Personal computers and mathematical programs such as Mathcad and 
MATLAB can provide rapid and accurate solutions of the exact detection equa-
tions. Built-in Bessel, gamma, and other functions simplify use of these equations, 
and the root-finding ability of the mathematical platforms provides results when 
there is no closed-form expression for D(n) as a function of Pd. Where repetitive 
calculation of multiple values is required, reasonably accurate approximations are 
available to minimize computation time. The procedures outlined in this chapter, 
available as a Mathcad program in the accompanying DVD, are described here to 
permit implementation in any programming language. Approximations of varying 
complexity and accuracy are also given. 
4.2 
STEADY-TARGET DETECTABILITY FACTOR 
The basic detectability factor for a steady (nonfluctuating) target (Case 0) is de-
noted by D0(n). It is the theoretical value derived by Rice [3] for a single pulse, 
and by Marcum [4, 5] for n noncoherently integrated pulses. Exact expressions are 
given by DiFranco and Rubin [6], whose comprehensive work provides the basis 
for much of this chapter.  
The input parameters required for calculation of D0 are: 
  Detection probability Pd; 
  False-alarm probability Pfa;  
  Number n of envelope-detected pulses integrated. 

 
Detection Theory 
111 
In coherent radar applications, n is replaced by n = to/tf, the number of samples 
from prior coherent integration, where to is the observation (integration) time and 
tf is the coherent integration time.  
Notations used here are translated from those in the referenced literature (e.g., 
number of pulses N and signal-to-noise energy ratio Rp/2 in [6] are replaced by n 
and s). The factor D0(n) is denoted by D0(Pd,Pfa,n) and the detection probability Pd 
by Pd(s,n,Pfa) in some equations, to emphasize the dependence on all three input 
parameters. A simple s replaces the signal-to-noise power ratio S/N, for compact-
ness.  
4.2.1 
Exact Steady-Target Detection Probability 
The steady target is seldom found in practice, but it serves as a useful reference, 
generally giving the lower limit of D(n). An exact expression for detection proba-
bility, assuming a square-law detector,1 is [6, p. 348, Eq. (10.4-27)]:

Threshold Level 
To apply (4.1) we must first establish the threshold level yb that is the upper limit 
of the integral. Exact and approximate solutions for this threshold, which is com-
mon to all target models, are given here, before we return to calculations of detec-
tion probability.  
The probability of false alarm for a system that integrates n pulses is given by 
[6, p. 347, Eq. (10.4-18)]: 
                                                           
1  The relative performance of square-law and linear detectors is discussed by Marcum [5, pp. 35, 99], 
showing that the difference is < 0.1 dB, favoring the linear detector for 2  n < 70 and the square-
law for n > 70, with equal performance for n = 1 and n = 70. We will consider here only the square-
law detector.

If root-finding or the inverse of the incomplete gamma function is not availa-

The accuracies of these approximations are excellent except at low Pd, as 
shown in Figure 4.2. Errors are within 0.1 dB for values used in most practical 
applications of the radar equation. 
Another approach to approximation of D0(1) is to start with the simple, exact 
calculation for the Case 1 target (Section 4.3.4) and subtract the fluctuation loss 
(see Section 4.4.5) that applies to that target, as approximated by (4.54).

DETECTABILITY FACTORS FOR FLUCTUATING TARGETS 
4.3.1 
Generalized Chi-Square Target Fluctuation Model 
Virtually all actual radar targets have cross sections that vary with time, frequen-
cy, aspect angle, and polarization. The statistics of most fluctuating targets are 
described by the chi-square distribution. The chi-square distribution with m de-
grees of freedom (dof) is the distribution of the sum of m independent, normally 
distributed components. A target echo received and processed through an enve-
lope detector, without preceding coherent integration, has a chi-square distribution 
with m = 2ne dof, where ne is the number of independent pulses or signal samples, 
each contributing a vector signal component with normally distributed in-phase 
and quadrature components. 
Four commonly used models for targets fluctuating in time were introduced 
by Swerling [12]. These models have voltage statistics corresponding to chi-
square distributions with different degrees of freedom, representing samples of the 
Gaussian in-phase and quadrature components of the vector voltage for a target 
with either slow or fast fluctuation. Table 4.1 describes the Swerling model statis-
tics in terms of the number of dof, the number ne of independent target samples,

tion time tc to the pulse repetition interval tr at which n pulses are received over an

The models must be interpreted as applying not to the targets themselves, but to 
the echo signals of the target as observed by a radar system whose location, rela-
tive to the target, may change with time, and whose radiated waveform may also 
change as a result of frequency or polarization diversity. The radar system design-
er can change the fluctuation statistics of a given target to avoid prolonged fades 
by exploiting diversity, usually in frequency, where multiple channels operating in 
parallel or in sequence are available.  
The four Swerling cases are described by Table 4.1, but the general chi-
square distribution is more broadly applicable. Methods of estimating ne for radars 
with diversity are described in Section 4.5. Integer values other than ne = 1, 2, n, 
or 2n are commonly observed, as well as noninteger values, and these are accom-
modated in the general expressions developed in [13], given in Section 4.3.2. 
4.3.2 
Detection of Signals with Chi-Square Statistics 
The probability that a chi-square distributed quantity with m dof lies below 2 is

Barton presents in [2, 13] an approximate method of finding Pd and D(n) for 
all Swerling cases and for signal models with arbitrary dof and ne. The integral of 
the chi-square distribution3 P(2,m) and its inverse function P
1(p,m) are used in 
[2, 13], but are replaced here by the corresponding incomplete gamma function P 
and its inverse for comparison with equations for the Swerling models given in 
[6]. The relationship between the functions is:

The notation D(Pd, Pfa,n,ne) can be simplified to D(n,ne). Both P and P and their 
inverse functions are included as built-in functions in platforms such as Mathcad. 
Approximation errors in D from (4.24) are shown in Sections 4.3.3–4.3.5, with 
errors less than 0.2 dB for most radar and target parameters. 
The notation D(n,ne), with the appropriate value of ne, replaces D(n) as the 
basic detectability factor in the radar equation, covering all target statistics dis-
cussed above, as well as fractional values of m discussed by Weinstock [14]. 
While the steady target can be approximated by the chi-square distribution with 
ne  50, better accuracy is obtained using Shnidman’s approximation (Section 
4.2.5). 
4.3.3 
Swerling Case 1 
This section discusses Case 1, known as the Rayleigh target (the Rayleigh distri-
bution is the chi-square with two degrees of freedom). It is of primary importance 
in radar, because it is the distribution inherent in any target echo that results from 
multiple (e.g., more than about four) scattering sources of comparable magnitude. 
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sum of m independent-

 
Detection Theory 
121 
ly varying quantities tends toward the Gaussian distribution as m increases, re-
gardless of their individual distributions. Hence the vector echo voltage from mul-
tiple scatterers (m > 4) consists of Gaussian in-phase and quadrature components, 
and the magnitude of the vector has a Rayleigh distribution. Very few targets en-
countered in actual radar operation depart significantly from this distribution, ex-
cept through the exploitation of diversity in the radar transmission (see Section 
4.5). 
The target echo from a Rayleigh-distributed (Swerling Case 1) target has sig-
nal-plus-noise voltage and power distributions like those of noise alone, but the 
mean power is the sum of the mean signal and mean noise powers:

This expression is found by assuming that the incomplete gamma functions in 
(4.28) are near unity for Pfa <<1. It is exact for n = 1, and the error in Pd is < 0.005 
for Pfa < 0.05 and negligible for Pfa < 0.01 or s > 10. However, this approximation 
cannot be inverted to yield the detectability factor, requiring a further approxima-
tion. 
The detectability factor is obtained from [6, p. 392, Eq. (11.2-43)], which is 
derived by first taking the natural logarithm of both sides, and then assuming that 
ln(1 + 1/ns)  1/ns and 1 + ns  ns in (4.30), to obtain

Curves are not shown for n = 1, where exact solutions are readily computed from

4.3.4.2 Approximations for Case 2 Detection Probability and Detectability 
Factor 
Where the inverse incomplete gamma function is not available, it may be approx-
imated as derived by Gregers-Hansen, using (4.11). That approximation has diffi-
culty with the denominator of (4.37), however, when Pd > 0.95, and hence should 
be used with caution. Approximations in [6, p. 407] exhibit larger errors, and are 
not recommended, given the ease with which the inverse incomplete gamma func-
tion can be evaluated. The steady-target D0 approximations with n > 20 give D2 
with adequate accuracy for many purposes. 
4.3.5 
Swerling Case 3 
In [6, p. 410, Eq. (11.4-21)] an expression is derived for the probability density 
function of signal plus noise for Case 3. From this, an approximate expression for 
Case 3 detection probability is obtained [6, p. 421, Eq. (11.4-24)]:

(4.38) to obtain detectability factor D3(n) is possible only through root-finding 
methods. 
Approximations are given in [6] for Case 3 with n >>1, using a graphical 
method for inversion of the Pd equation to yield D3(n). More accurate approxima-

APPROXIMATE EQUATIONS BASED ON DETECTOR LOSS 
In [15] a method was developed approximate the detectability factor using func-
tions commonly available on pocket calculators without numerical integration or 
root-finding. The only special functions used in this method are (E), the integral 
of the normal distribution and its inverse 1(P), given by (4.8) and available 
through analytic approximations in [7]. The method is of continuing value because 
it associates the integration loss with the signal-to-noise ratio at the input to the 
envelope detector, whose nonlinearity destroys information that would be availa-
ble if coherent detection could be used. 
4.4.1 
Coherent Detection 
Detection of an exactly known signal is discussed in [6, pp. 291–298]. A single 
pulse arriving with known frequency and phase is passed through a coherent de-
tector, in which a reference sinusoid having that frequency and phase performs 
linear conversion of the input signal to a positive pulse at baseband. The resulting 
detector output signal-to-noise ratio so is exactly twice that of the input s, half the 
noise power being rejected by the detector. The threshold level is given exactly as

For example, the requirement for coherent detection is Dc1(0.9,106) = 12.60 dB, 
for a single pulse, compared with D0(1) = 13.18 dB for the envelope-detected 
pulse. Coherent integration of n pulses results in a requirement for each pulse giv-

Since the phase of a previously undetected signal is unpredictable, coherent 
detection cannot be implemented in practice. However, it provides a minimum 
reference requirement from which values applicable to noncoherent detection and 
integration can be calculated if the loss inherent in envelope detection is known. 
4.4.2 
Envelope Detection and Detector Loss 
Detector loss, also called the “small-signal suppression effect,” occurs when a 
signal, accompanied by noise, is passed through an envelope detector. The output 
signal-to-noise ratio so is reduced from 2s, as in the coherent detector, to

The approximation Cx = (s + 2.3)/s was determined empirically in [15]. Setting

the n-pulse, steady target detectability factor, we obtain

The error is calculating the detectability factor from detector loss is shown in 
Figure 4.8, for n = 1, 10, and 100 and Pfa = 103 and 106. This procedure underes-
timates the requirement for very high Pd, overestimates it for very low Pd, and is 
within tenths of a decibel for 0.3 < Pd < 0.9. 
4.4.3 
Integration Loss 
The total signal energy required at the input of the envelope detector is nD0(n), 
and the ratio of that total to the single-pulse energy requirement is called integra-
tion loss, as defined by Marcum [4]:

As shown in [15], integration loss is not a property of the integrator, but rather is 
an increase in detector loss due to the reduced input S/N made possible by the 
integration gain. Note that Li depends on Pd and Pfa only to the extent that these 
probabilities affect D01. A single family of curves for Li, Figure 4.9, thus covers all 
combinations of detection requirements, rather than having an infinite number of 
curves for possible pairs of Pd and Pfa, some of which are presented in [4] and oth-
er literature. 
It can be seen that the penalty for noncoherent integration of n < 10 pulses is 
small when the requirement is for D01 > 10 dB, but that it increases as 
n  for 
larger n.

4.4.4 
Integration Gain 
The fact that noncoherent integration carries a loss Li does not mean that this type 
of integration is undesirable. It means that it is less effective than coherent integra-
tion of the same number of input pulses, but coherent integration is often impossi-
ble or even undesirable. As will be shown in Section 4.5.1, noncoherent integra-
tion of 2  n  10 samples, obtained with diversity, may provide better perfor-
mance for Pd > 0.5 than coherent integration, even when the latter can be imple-
mented.  
The gain in performance from noncoherent integration, compared with a sin-
gle pulse, is

. For moderate values of n, it

required. 
4.4.5 
Fluctuation Loss 
The detectability factor for a Case 1 fluctuating target may be found by multiply-
ing the steady-target detectability factor D0(n) by a fluctuation loss Lf1, defined as

where it is understood that the probabilities Pd and Pfa are the same for both tar-

seen from Figure 4.10. The loss is  0 dB for Pd  0.35, and turns negative (be-
comes a gain) for Pd < 0.35.  
An analytic approximation of the data in Figure 4.10 gives the fluctuation loss

cess, using the North approximation for D01, the detector loss approximation for 
Li, and (4.54) for Lf1,is shown in Figure 4.11. 
The calculation can also be done by reading and adding the decibels values of 
steady-target detectability factor D01 from Figure 4.1, integration loss Li from Fig-
ure 4.9, and fluctuation loss Lf1 from Figure 4.10, and subtracting 10logn:

DIVERSITY IN RADAR 
4.5.1 
Diversity Gain 
The large fluctuation loss for Pd > 0.5 suggests that noncoherent integration of 
multiple independent target samples (ne > 1) obtained by diversity can result in 
improved detection performance. As an example, assume that 16 pulses are re-
ceived during a beam dwell time to on a Case 1 target: to = 16tr. They might be 
integrated coherently to provide a single sample at the envelope detector with en-
ergy E/N0 = 16E1/N0, where E1 is the single-pulse energy. For a specified Pd = 0.9, 
Pfa = 106, (4.27) yields  
 
D1(1) = 130.1 = 21.1 dB 
Alternatively, if the RF bandwidth of the transmitter, antenna, and the microwave 
components of the receiving system permit, the 16 pulses can be transmitted in

two 8-pulse groups at different frequencies, four 4-pulse groups at four frequen-
cies, eight 2-pulse groups at eight frequencies, or 16 single pulses at different fre-
quencies. Coherent integration could be performed on the pulses within a given 
frequency group, and noncoherent integration performed on the resulting outputs 
at different frequencies. Assuming that the frequencies differ by an the amount 
needed to decorrelate the echoes (see Section 4.5.2), the total energy required will 
follow the curves shown in Figure 4.12. 
For Pd = 0.9, the best performance is obtained with ne = 8, with a total energy 
requirement 4.9 dB less than a system without diversity; ne = 4 is almost as good. 
The optimum ne is reduced to four, and then to two, as Pd is reduced through 0.8 to 
0.5. 
4.5.2 
Signal and Target Models with Diversity 
The radar target usually consists of several scattering sources whose reflected 
fields add vectorially at the radar antenna. As long as the number of such sources 
exceeds about four, the statistics of each quadrature component in the combined 
field approach Gaussian, leading to the Case 1 target (ne = 1, dof = 2) that has a 
Rayleigh distribution of voltage. There is no physical basis for a target having 
dof > 2, although a target containing one dominant scatterer is often modeled ap-
proximately as Case 3 (dof = 4). The Swerling models should, instead, be inter-
preted as representing the distribution of echo signals received and processed by a

space, and possibly in polarization.

sight. Note that the effective coherent integration time is limited to tf  tc, since the 
signal phase is decorrelated over longer periods. 
4.5.2.2 Frequency Diversity

4.5.2.3 Space Diversity 
Monostatic radars view a target over a single path such that the aspect angle of the 
target changes slowly with time, as expressed by a in (4.60). Multistatic radar 
uses multiple simultaneous paths and can take advantage of space diversity to 
obtain multiple independent samples on each pulse. When the angle  of the bi-
sector of transmitting and receiving paths, measured with respect to the target ax-
is, varies by , the number of independent signal samples is

Orthogonally polarized antenna channels are rare in radar, but if present they may 
increase the number independent echo signals by nep = 2. There are only two or-
thogonal polarizations (e.g., vertical and horizontal, right- and left-hand circular, 
or any pair of orthogonal elliptical polarizations).

The Marcum/Swerling models for which detectability factors were derived above 
can represent the following target and radar descriptions: 
Case 0:  A single scatterer, a corner reflector with fixed aspect angle, or a 
spherical target, modeled by ne  ; 
Case 1:  Rayleigh target, to << tc with fixed-frequency radar, giving ne = 1; 
Case 2:  Rayleigh target, tr  tc or f /fc  n, or a combination giving ne = n; 
Case 3:  Rayleigh target, to << tc with dual-frequency or dual-polarization ra-
dar, giving ne = 2; 
Case 4:  Case 2 with space or polarization diversity, giving ne = 2n. 

138 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Thus the Swerling models describe not different target types, but rather the echo 
signals received from the multiple-scatterer target viewed by radars with different 
degrees of diversity. An aircraft or other complex target will be Case 1 for fixed-
frequency radar unless to is at least a significant fraction of tc. For aircraft viewed 
at microwave frequencies, tc > 0.1s is normal, and for typical integration times 
1 < ne < 1.5. In order for a target to approach Case 2, tc must approach the pulse 
repetition interval tr, implying (even for millimeter-wave radar) aspect angle rates 
exceeding those normally experienced. Thus, radar-target situations typically give 
ne  1, unless frequency diversity or agility, space diversity, or polarization diver-
sity is used. 
4.6 
VISIBILITY FACTOR 
Useful data on detection performance of human operators, viewing cathode-ray-
tube displays, are very limited. During World War II, experiments were performed 
at the MIT Radiation Laboratory to determine the visibility factor for different 
types of display. One result is the PPI visibility factor V0(50), applicable to 
Pd = 50% on a steady target under optimum viewing conditions, shown in Figure 
5.13. Blake [17, p. 2] notes that that this curve is applicable to intensity-modulated 
displays generally, and states that it is 
based on Figs. 8.2 and 9.2 of [18] or Figs 1 and 21 of [19], adjusted to 0.5 probability and ex-
trapolated to single-pulse detection, with slight revision of slopes as ends of the curve. 
It is impossible to determine the false-alarm probability for the process represent-
ed by Figure 5.13. A typical PPI displays about 105 radar resolution cells and pre-
sents data over a scan period of  10s. Hence, if a single false alarm per scan re-
sults from the process, Pfa = 106 can be assumed. Comparing the single-pulse 
value V0(50) = 13.2 dB with the steady-target detectability factor D0 = 11.2 dB for 
Pd = 50%, Pfa = 106, it can be seen that the visual detection process incurs a loss 
of some 2 dB compared with electronic detection on a single output of a matched 
filter. The bandwidth correction factor Cb appearing in (1.16) is in addition to that 
2-dB loss, so for Cb = 0 dB there is still a 2-dB reduction in performance relative 
to the matched filter with electronic detection.  
When other than Pd = 0.50 and Pfa = 106 on steady targets is required, the V0 
data offer no guidance as to the change in required energy ratio. An approximation 
can be made based on the data developed for electronic detection in previous sec-
tions of this chapter. Adjustments for nonoptimum viewing conditions and opera-
tor performance are discussed in [18], but, as Blake notes in [20, p. 370]: 
The concept of operator loss is also sometimes employed, to describe the increase in D0 re-
quired by a typical operator compared to an ideal integrator. However, again the approach 
here has been to express D0 directly … as the value applicable to an actual human operator. 

 
Detection Theory 
139 
The operator loss tends in practice to become an arbitrary factor to account for observe dis-
crepancies between computer performance and observed radar performance; and while in 
some cases it may be a valid explanation, in others it may be misused to conceal ignorance to 
why a radar’s actual performance is less than predicted by calculations. In any case, it is too 
vague a concept to employ in a range calculation aimed at evaluating the merit of a particular 
radar design or for other engineering purposes. 
Omitted from that discussion is the difference between D0 for electronic detection 
with a matched filter and V0 for visual detection with a receiver noise bandwidth 
Bn = 1.2/ and a video bandwidth restricted by resolution on the display. That is-
sue requires that visual detection procedures include losses different from those 
used in electronic detection.

SUMMARY OF DETECTION THEORY 
This chapter presented methods for calculating the basic detectability factor, based 
on detection theory, for target models including the steady target (Case 0), fluctu-
ating targets described by Swerling Cases 1–4, and the more general class of tar-
get echoes having chi-square distributions with an arbitrary number of degrees of 
freedom.  
 Exact expressions for Pd that are accurate to within 0.01 dB in the correspond-
ing signal-to-noise ratios are available from [6] for Cases 0–5. Solutions to 
these expressions using root-finding methods are thus able to give the detect-
ability factors to that accuracy.  
 Approximations for calculating D(n) that approach this accuracy for most 
cases of practical interest have also been presented, with plots that compare 
their results with the solutions for D(n) obtained by root-finding from the ex-
act equations.  
 The value of D(n) includes two factors that may or may not appear as sepa-
rate terms: the integration loss Li(n) (see Section 4.4.3) and the fluctuation 
loss Lf (see Section 4.4.5). Both these losses increase D(n) relative to a theo-
retical minimum value given by D01/n that would apply to a steady signal in-
tegrated coherently. They must be included as components of system loss Ls 
when the search radar equation is used, but need not be evaluated individually 
for use in the normal radar equation. 
 Any radar equation requires, once D(n) has been found, that a series of practi-
cal losses be calculated for the practical radar under consideration. The Blake 
chart described in Section 1.3.2 has separate entries for a bandwidth correc-
tion factor Cb, a beamshape loss Lp, and a miscellaneous loss Lx. The chart as 
modified in Section 1.4.2 includes Lp and Lx, and substitutes a matching fac-
tor M for Cb.  
 The beamshape loss Lp, is the subject of Chapter 5, and the matching factor M 
along with a number of components of Lx are discussed in Chapter 10. The 
effective detectability factor Dx(n) used in radar equations (1.19)–(1.23) is 
calculated as the product of these losses and D(n). Thus Dx includes the losses 
that increase the required signal-to-noise energy ratio.  
 Losses that reduce the available energy ratio, including RF loss Lt, atmospher-
ic loss L, other losses that depend on range, are included as separate factors 
in (1.26).

CHAPTER 5 
Beamshape Loss 
The basic detectability factors derived in Chapter 4 could be used directly in the 
radar equation for an idealized radar design only if the signal were transmitted and 
received with constant two-way antenna gain GtGr during the time to required to 
collect n pulses or n coherently integrated samples of the signal, and if matched 
filtering and ideal post-detection integration were used. For a given antenna, var-
iation in gain is represented in the radar equation by the product ft fr that is includ-
ed in the pattern-propagation factor F 2 = FtFr (see Chapter 8). When a radar scans 
in angle to detect a target, the gain varies either during to (for continuous scan) or 
from one scan or beam dwell to another (for electronic raster scan or step-
scan).The effect of the resulting pattern modulation on the n pulses used in calcu-
lating D is expressed by the beamshape loss (or beamshape factor), denoted by Lp. 
This loss is discussed in this chapter for different target types and processing 
methods. It applies both to search radar and to tracking radar in its acquisition 
mode. In most cases the tracking radar after acquisition holds its beam close 
enough to the target to achieve the on-axis antenna gain, and no beamshape loss 
occurs in that mode of operation. 
5.1 
BACKGROUND 
5.1.1 
Definition of Beamshape Loss 
Beamshape loss is defined [1] as: 
A loss factor included in the radar equation to account for the use of the peak antenna gain in 
the radar equation instead of the effective gain that results when the received train of pulses is 
modulated by the two-way pattern of a scanning antenna. Synonym: antenna-pattern loss. 

144 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Recall that the number of integrated pulses n for a scanning radar is conven-
tionally calculated as the number received while the target is within the one-way, 
half-power beamwidth 3. The detection probability is conventionally calculated 
assuming integration of n pulses of equal level, and the inclusion of the loss com-
ponent Lp in radar equation is intended to ensure that the on-axis signal power is 
high enough that the detection probability Pd can be calculated as though all n 
pulses had been received with the on-axis antenna gain. Figure 5.1 shows a se-
quence of pulses received from a Gaussian beam scanning in one dimension, 
where n = 10 and the on-axis power is Lp = 1.33 times the power in the rectangular 
reference beam. This peak level of the modulated train has been set to make the 
energy of the modulated train equal to that of the rectangular beam. To recover 
that energy in signal processing, the integrator weighting must match the two-way 
Gaussian pattern of the beam, with significant contributions in the case illustrated 
from about 16 pulses rather than only the 10 within the half-power beamwidth. 
5.1.2 
Sampling in Angle Space 
The scanning radar performs sampling the angle space. For one-dimensional (1-D) 
scanning, a sample is either an individual pulse of the continuously scanning pulse 
train or the n-pulse group of a step-scanned antenna.1 Each line in the search raster 
for two-dimensional (2-D) scanning is sampled first in the coordinate of rapid 
scanning. With electronic step-scanning, the n pulses have the same amplitude, 
but that amplitude varies with the position of the target relative to the axis of the

beam and has a Gaussian distribution when targets are uniformly distributed in 
angle. The successive scan lines in 2-D scanning provide samples in the other 
coordinate, usually combined through the cumulative probability of detection, 
defined as the probability that detection occurs on at least one line of the scan ra-
ther than by integration (see Section 10.2.5). 
The angular sampling interval  is defined here in units of the one-way, half-
power beamwidth 3 in the angle coordinate of interest.2 Radars normally obtain 
samples that are spaced by   0.71, which can be described as dense sampling, 
and for which n  1.41. The beamshape loss is then simply the ratio of the target 
echo energy that would have been received if the beam were rectangular, with 
widths equal to the half-power widths of the actual beam, to the energy received 
during the scan by the actual beam pattern. The center of the beam in 1-D scan-
ning is assumed to pass directly across the target. When it does not, the pattern-
propagation factor F is applied in the unscanned coordinate to account for the re-
duced signal.  
Sampling intervals  > 0.71 provide sparse sampling in angle space. The 
beamshape loss is no longer a simple ratio of average energy received in the scan-
ning beam to that of a rectangular reference beam. Rather, it must be defined as 
the increase in on-axis power required to achieve an average probability of detec-
tion Pd equal to what would have been achieved for a target lying on the beam axis 
during all n pulses. The average Pd over angle space cannot be found by integrat-
ing n samples whose total energy is n times that of the average sample. This is 
because, in seeking to obtain Pd > 0.4, the reduced Pd for samples near the edge of 
the beam pattern reduces the average Pd more than it is increased by samples near 
the axis. 
5.1.3 
Literature on Beamshape Loss 
5.1.3.1 Dense Sampling 
Beamshape loss was introduced in Blake’s 1953 paper [2]. He expresses the loss 
in terms of a reduction in the number of full-amplitude (on-axis) pulses that would 
provide the same total energy as obtained from the pulse train modulated by the 
pattern of the scanning beam. Blake considers an exponential beam than scans 
across the target, delivering pulses to a receiver using a square-law detector. The 
improvement from integration of the received pulse train is given in terms of inte-
grals over the portion of the beam pattern that lies within a rectangular integration 
window, from which he derives the optimum window width and integration gain. 
He expresses the result in terms of an equivalent number of equal-amplitude puls-

sine space, maintaining their values relative to the varying beamwidth at off-broadside angles.

es given by 0.473n, assuming initially n >> 1 and uniform integrator weighting 
over the optimum angular interval 0.8443. Because large n implies low single-
pulse signal-to-noise ratio (snr), the integration gain is proportional to

. For lower pulse densities, 
but excluding the sparse sampling case, Blake derives the available integration 
gain using summations rather than integrals, and concludes that the results agree 
closely with the high-density case.  
In the addendum [3] to his paper, Blake notes that for a linear detector giving 
integration gain proportional to n, the optimum integration interval is 1.23 and 
the loss is Lp = 1/0.67 = 1.5 = 1.7 dB. He subsequently presents the range calcula-
tion [4] in the form now known as the Blake chart that includes an entry for Lp. He 
suggests the following values as a simple model for beamshape loss:  
 
Lp1 = 1.6 dB for one-coordinate (1-D) scanning;  
 
Lp2 = 2Lp1 = 3.2 dB for two-coordinate (2-D) scanning.  
where the primed symbols denote values in decibels. We will consider in Sections 
5.1.3 and 5.3–5.5 the relationship between this simple beamshape loss model and 
results of subsequent studies.  
5.1.3.2 Sparse Sampling  
Studies on beamshape loss by Hall and Barton [5,6] consider lower sample densi-
ties (0.5 < n < 2), such as might occur in radars using electronic scan, or in two-
dimensional (2-D) scans where successive beam dwells and scan lines are spaced 
in the order of the beamwidth. The beamshape loss, expressed as the increase in 
on-axis signal power needed to maintain a given Pd for targets uniformly distribut-
ed in angle space with respect to sample points, is found to depend strongly on Pd, 
sample spacing, processing method, and the target fluctuation model. 
Analytical approximations for beamshape loss with sparse sampling are given 
by Barton in [7, p. 137; 8, p. 494; 9, p. 87]. The procedures for generating these 
approximations are refined in this chapter to obtain more accurate models for dif-
ferent scan patterns and targets over the range of sampling densities and detection 
probabilities typically required in calculation of detection range.

Antenna Patterns 
A common model for the radar antenna voltage pattern3 is the Gaussian beam, 
which closely follows the pattern of most antennas out to about the 10 dB level, 
but has no sidelobes:

The values shown in Table 5.1 are beamshape losses used in the normal radar 
equation for dense sampling ( < 0.71). As will be shown below, the search radar 
equation and the normal equation with sparse sampling require loss values that 
vary with , approaching the values of Table 5.1 only in special cases.  
5.3 
SPARSE SAMPLING IN 1-D SCAN 
Radars that perform search with narrow beams must generally minimize the time 
allocated to searching a given angle space, which may lead to sparse sampling 
(beam dwells spaced by  > 0.71). The beamshape loss then depends on the re-
quired detection probability Pd, the spacing, the integration procedure, and the 
target fluctuation model.  
When using radar equations developed in Chapter 1 it is assumed that the 
scan pattern of the radar has been taken into account in calculating the radar pa-
rameters, and that the transmitted energy per beam dwell is constant (independent 
of the spacing of the dwells). If spacing less than the beamwidth is used, more 
energy is allocated to a given solid angle. On the other hand, when the search ra-
dar equation of Chapter 2 is used, the transmitted energy per scan is constant, be-
cause in the derivation of the equation the idealized rectangular beams were as-
sumed to be contiguous with no overlap. This changes the reference used in calcu-
lation of beamshape loss, as explained in Section 5.3.5. Spacing of dwells closer 
than the beamwidth then reduces the available energy per dwell. Hence, the 

150 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
beamshape loss required for use in the search radar equation differs from that used 
in the normal radar equation.  
5.3.1 
Method of Calculation for 1-D Scan 
The number of samples n available for integration is the reciprocal of the beam 
spacing  in beamwidths. Sparse sampling,  > 0.71, corresponds to n < 1.41. We 
will assume that the integrator weighting function is matched to the beam pattern, 
so that the output snr depends on the total signal energy received during the scan. 
A small integration loss, increasing for n > 1, appears separately in calculation of 
the basic detectability factor, Section 4.4.3. The procedure for selecting and aver-
aging sample positions and amplitudes to calculate beamshape loss is as follows. 
 Beam Spacing. The beam spacing k is expressed in units of the beamwidth 
3, and is varied over 0.5    1.5 to overlap with the dense sampling case 
and extend to the maximum practical beam spacing. To generate smooth out-
put plots, the spacing is varied in increments  = 0.05, giving k = k for 
k = 10, 11, …, 30. 
 Beam Angles. Three beams are denoted by m = 1, 2, 3, and are centered at an-
gles b(k,m) = (m  2)k, as shown in Figure 5.2. 
 Target Angles. To represent targets distributed uniformly in angle , five tar-
gets are placed at angles t( j,k) between the axis of beam 2 and a point half-
way to the axis of beam 3, as shown in Figure 5.2. The target index varies 
over j = 1, 2, …, jmax , where jmax = 5:

 Off-Axis Angles. The angle between target position t( j,k) and the axis 
b(k,m) of beam m is calculated to obtain a three-dimensional matrix of off-
axis angle for each signal sample:

 Sample SNR. The snr for each sample is calculated using the beam pattern 
fcos() of an aperture with cosine illumination from (5.5). That pattern closely 
represents that of many practical radars, in which the mainlobe is bounded by 
nulls, with a first sidelobe level of 23 dB. The result is a four-dimensional 
matrix:

(5.13) 
where si is the on-axis snr. This snr is varied in decibel steps: si = 0, 1, …, 35 
dB to cover the desired values of Pd. Different procedures are then used to 
calculate Lp1, depending on the target model and signal processing method.  
5.3.2 
Steady-Target Beamshape Loss for 1-D Scan 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the steady target with two processing 
methods of combining the signals are listed in Table 5.2. 
The subscript {0} denotes the steady target. The detectability factors in (5.17) 
and (5.23) are calculated for four values of detection probability to be used in sub-
sequent plots of beamshape loss: Pdu = 0.1u, where u = 3, 5, 7, 9. The reference 
detectability factor Dr{0} given by (5.18) is obtained from (4.18), adjusted for co-
herent integration of the nk = 1/k signal samples that would be received in the 
rectangular reference beam of Figure 5.1. Integration loss is a separate component 
of Dx in the radar equation. For  > 1, a single sample with power 1/k is assumed 
in calculating the reference Dr{0}. 
5.3.2.1 Steady Target with Integration 
The 1-D beamshape loss Lp1{0} for a steady target with integration is shown in 
Figure 5.3. Curves for all values of Pd merge with the dense-sample value 
Lp0 = 1.24 dB for spacings  < 0.71. For  > 0.71 and Pd  0.45, the loss drops 
below Lp0 because the increase in Pd near the axis more than compensates for the 
decrease near the edge of the beam. Increasing loss for k > 0.8, Pd > 0.45 con-
firms the results of [5, 6]. Since spacings   1.5 cause losses that are excessive 
for most radar applications, the data presented here are limited to   1.5.

5.3.2.2 Steady Target with Cumulative Detection 
The cumulative detection probability is the probability that detection will be 
achieved in at least one of several attempts during the scan. With respect to 
beamshape loss, detection is attempted separately in each beam position (dwell). 
The results are shown in Figure 5.4. The loss now includes the effect the lower 
efficiency of cumulative detection, as compared with integration (see Section 
10.2.5). There is an optimum beam spacing near 0.75 beamwidths for high Pd, 
when cumulative detection over successive beam positions replaces integration. 
Thus it appears that integration of steady-target samples is worthwhile even when 
the number of samples per beamwidth drops to unity. 
5.3.3 
Case 1 Beamshape Loss for 1-D Scan 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the Case 1 target with the two pro-
cessing methods of combining the signals are listed in Table 5.3. For integration, 
the steps are parallel to those used with the steady target, but substituting the Case 
1 terms Pd{1} from (4.26) and Dr{1} from (4.27) in steps (2) and (5). Because the 
samples of the Case 1 target are correlated over the scan, it is necessary to calcu-
late the cumulative probability of detection by first calculating Pc{0} for the steady 
target (see Table 5.2), and then finding Pc{1} by integrating Pc{0} over the exponen-
tial distribution that describes the Case 1 fluctuation from one scan to the next. 
Subsequent steps parallel those for the steady target.

Lp0 = 1.24 dB and below 4.2 dB for 0.5 <  < 1.5. This is because target fluctua-
tion causes the values of detectability factor for Case 1 targets to change more 
rapidly with varying Pd, masking the variation in signal power caused by the beam 
pattern. The beamshape loss for Case 1 is less than for the steady target for 
Pd > 0.65, and greater below that probability. 
5.3.3.2 Case 1 with Cumulative Detection 
The results for Case 1 with cumulative detection are shown in Figure 5.6. The loss 
is greater than with integration for all sample spacings. The optimum beam spac-
ing is near 0.95 beamwidths for high Pd. The loss shows less variation with Pd for 
 > 1 that was found with the steady-target. 
5.3.4 
Case 2 Beamshape Loss for 1-D Scan 
The Case 2 target provides independent target amplitudes for each sample. For 
integration, however, the number of such independent samples in the three beams, 
used in calculating the probability of detection Pd{2} and reference detectability 
factor Dr{2}, depends on the weightings of samples in the matched integrator:

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The reference detectability factors for the three target models are shown in Figure 
5.8, for a beam spacing k = 1, at which ne(k) = 1.5. The factor for Case 2 ap-
proaches that for Case 1 with large spacings, for which ne(k)  1, and approaches 
that for the steady target with small spacings, ne(k) >> 1. 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the Case 2 target with two pro-
cessing methods of combining the signals are listed in Table 5.4. For integration, 
the steps parallel those used with the steady target, but with substitution of the 
Case 2 terms Pd{2} from (4.36) in step (2) and Dr{2} from (4.37), adjusted for k, in 
step (5).

5.3.4.1 Case 2 with Integration 
The loss for Case 2 with integration is not illustrated because it is practically in-
distinguishable from that of Case 1 (Figure 5.5). There is slightly greater spread of 
the curves as   1.5, but the differences from Case 1 are less than 0.2 dB. 
5.3.4.2 Case 2 with Cumulative Detection 
The results for Case 2 with cumulative detection are shown in Figure 5.9. The 
results for  > 1 are between those for the steady target and Case 1. Because the 
reference detectability factor includes the diversity benefit of Case 2 with integra-
tion, relative to Case 1, the losses at  = 0.5 are spread slightly about the value 
that applies to the steady target and Case 1, and the beamshape loss for Pd > 0.3 is 
higher than for Case 1. This does not imply that greater snr is necessary, however, 
because the reference value has been reduced by a greater amount than the in-
crease in Lp.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
5.3.5 
Beamshape Loss Used in the Search Radar Equation for 1-D Scan 
The search radar equation is based on uniform distribution of the energy transmit-
ted during the frame time ts among contiguous dwells of the idealized rectangular 
beam ( = 1) covering the defined search sector. With continuous scan, the 
“dwell” can be considered the processing time leading to a detection decision, 
while in step-scan it is the dwell time of each step.  
The energy per dwell must be reduced for actual beam spacings  < 1, and 
increased for  > 1, to keep the total energy during ts constant. Application of the 
search radar equation to 1-D scan thus requires that the energy per dwell vary di-
rectly with the spacing . When calculating beamshape loss as a function of , it 
is convenient to include this variation of energy as contributing to a net 
beamshape loss Lpn1 for use in the search radar equation. The result is

suggest that the optimum beam spacing with integration is   1.1 for Pd = 0.9, 
increasing as Pd is reduced. 
An electronically scanned search might perform a pseudorandom scan rather 
than a deterministic step-scan. In this case, integration over adjacent beams might 
be too difficult to perform, and the cumulative detection process would be used. 
The net beamshape loss with cumulative detection is shown in Figures 5.12 and 
5.13 for steady and Case 1 targets. Optimum spacing for the steady target is the 
same as for integration of the signal, increasing to k = 1.2 for Case 1. The losses 
for optimum spacing are Lpn1 = 3.1 dB for the steady target and Lpn1 = 1.9 dB for 
the fluctuating target.  
Net beamshape loss curves for other fluctuating targets are not included here, 
since Case 1 is the predominant type for which radar systems must be designed, 
and Case 2 results lie between those for the steady target and Case 1.

SPARSE SAMPLING IN 2-D RASTER SCAN 
The 2-D raster scan uses a rectangular beam grid, as shown in Figure 5.14. The 
target locations used to find averages over angle space occupy one quadrant of the 
center beam. Analysis of beamshape loss is more complicated than for 1-D scan, 
but can be simplified by assuming the same beam spacing for the two coordinates, 
as is usually the case. Although the figure shows circular beams, the analysis is 
applicable to elliptical beams where the spacing is scaled to the beamwidth in 
each coordinate. 
A second complication is that any of three processing methods may be used: 
integration or cumulative detection over the entire scan or integration across each 
line followed by cumulative detection over the three lines, which we will call 
mixed processing.

A third complication is that four target models must now be considered, ra-
ther than three:  
 Steady target: Equal signal power for all samples in the scan; 
 Case 1 target: Fluctuating power, correlated over the entire scan (Case 1); 
 Case 2 target: Fluctuating power, decorrelated from dwell to dwell (Case 2); 
 Diversity target: Fluctuating power, correlated over each line but decorrelated 
between successive lines of the scan. The decorrelation results from some 
form of diversity, and this target case will be denoted by the subscript D.  
Although procedures for analysis of all four models are presented, only re-
sults for the last three cases are given, as the steady target is seldom encountered. 
Chi-squared statistics for the fluctuating target will be treated, and other models 
can be analyzed using the procedure described for chi-squared targets. Analytic 
approximations for the steady-target beamshape loss in other cases are presented 
in Appendix 5A. The results for integration may be found as the square (twice the 
decibel value) of the losses shown in Figure 5.3 for 1-D scan.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
5.4.1 
Method of Calculation for 2-D Scan 
The geometry for 2-D scan is similar to that in Section 5.3.1 for the 1-D scan, with 
the following changes:  
 Beam Spacing. The beam spacing 0.5  k  1.5 beamwidths remains the 
same as for the 1-D scan, and is applied equally to both angle coordinates. 
 Beam Angles. There are nine beams, denoted by subscripts m = 1, 2, ..., 9, 
with axes located at positions m(k,m) = xk, m,yk, m, as shown in Figure 5.14. 
The three scan lines are denoted by a = 1, 2, 3, each containing three beams 
m1(a)  m  m2(a). For example, m1(1) = 1 and m2(1) = 3. 
 Target Angles. There are 25 target positions t( j,k) = xj, m,yj, m, as shown in 
Figure 5.14, where j = 1, 2, ..., 25.  
The coordinate x is understood to be the coordinate of the more rapid scan 
line, over which integration is more easily performed. It may be either azi-
muth, elevation, or a coordinate in sine space. The orthogonal coordinate is y. 
 Off-Axis Angles. The off-axis angle from the center of each beam to each tar-
get location is calculated as

before applying (5.13). Angles , x, and y are expressed in units of the beam-
width 3. 
 Sample SNR. Calculation of the sample snr s(i,j,k,m) is the same as for the 1-
D scan, using (5.13). 
5.4.2 
Steady-Target Beamshape Loss for 2-D Scan 
The steps for integration and cumulative detection over the entire scan remain as 
listed in Table 5.2, but with k
2 replacing k in the reference detectability factors 
of step (5), and the 2-D loss Lp2 replacing Lp1. The upper limits for m and j are 9 
and 25, respectively. 
The steps in calculation for mixed processing are listed in Table 5.5. Data for 
the steady target are not plotted here because it has been found that a close ap-
proximation can be obtained by squaring the 1-D loss (doubling the decibel value) 
from Figures 5.3 and 5.4.

5.4.3.1 Case 1 with Integration 
The results for Case 1 with integration are shown in Figure 5.15. The beamshape 
loss lies above 2Lp0 = 2.48 dB and below 9.6 dB for 0.5 < k < 1.5. Compared

with the Case 1 loss for the 1-D scan, it is seen that the 2-D loss is almost exactly 
the square of the 1-D loss (twice the decibel value). 
5.4.3.2 Case 1 with Cumulative Detection 
The results for Case 1 with cumulative detection are shown in Figure 5.16. The 
lower efficiency of the cumulative detection process is included, increasing the 
loss for small sample spacings. As was the case with integration, the 2-D loss is 
approximately the square of the 1-D loss. 
5.4.3.3 Case 1 with Mixed Processing 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the Case 1 target with mixed pro-
cessing are listed in Table 5.6. Step (1) performs integration over each line a = 1, 
2, 3. Step (2) gives the corresponding steady-target detection probabilities, and 
step (3) forms the steady-target cumulative probability. Step (4) converts to the 
Case 1 cumulative probability Pm. Steps (5)–(8) parallel (3)–(6) of Table 5.3. 
The Case 1 beamshape loss with mixed processing is shown in Figure 5.17. 
The cumulative detection loss is reduced by integration over each line, so the loss 
at  = 0.5 drops to 4.5 dB, which is midway between the losses at that spacing for 
integration and cumulative detection over the entire scan. The loss for large 
spacings approaches that for cumulative detection over the entire scan.

Figure 5.18 shows the number of samples as a function of beam spacing. The ref-
erence detectability factors for all target models (including the diversity target 
discussed in Section 5.4.5) are shown in Figure 19. It can be seen that the diversity 
target detectability factor lies midway between the Case 1 and Case 2 targets.

5.4.4.1 Case 2 with Integration  
The beamshape loss for the Case 2 target with integration is shown in Figure 5.20. 
As with the Case 1 target, the losses converge to the dense-sample value for 
 < 0.71. For high Pd, they are slightly greater than for Case 1 as  increases.  
5.4.4.2 Case 2 Target with Cumulative Detection  
The Case 2 target loss with cumulative detection over the entire scan is shown in 
Figure 5.21. The optimum spacing for Pd = 0.9 is   0.9, giving Lp2 = 5.8 dB, and 
the optimum shifts upward with decreasing Pd to   1.1 for Pd = 0.3. The rela-
tively large loss for  < 0.7 is the result of the inefficient cumulative detection 
process. The loss with cumulative detection is greater for Case 2 than for Case 1, 
but this is the result of the lower reference level Dr2 for Case 2, and does not im-
ply that Case 2 requires a greater snr for a given level of detection performance.

5.4.4.3 Case 2 with Mixed Processing 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the Case 2 target with mixed pro-
cessing are listed in Table 5.7. Step (1) performs integration over each line a = 1, 
2, 3. Step (2) gives the corresponding Case 2 detection probabilities, where ne1 is 
the number of independent target samples in a single line, given by (5.34) and 
Figure 5.7. Step (3) forms the Case 2 cumulative probability Pm{2}. Steps (4)–(7) 
parallel (3)–(6) of Table 5.4. 
The beamshape loss for Case 2 with mixed processing is shown in Figure 
5.22. The curves are similar to those of the Case 1 target (Figure 5.17). Optimum 
spacings vary from  = 0.8 for Pd = 0.9 to  = 1.05 for Pd = 0.3.  
5.4.5 
Diversity Target Beamshape Loss for 2-D Scan 
The steps in calculating beamshape loss for the diversity target are listed in Table 
5.8 for integration and for cumulative detection over the entire scan. This target is 
defined as having Rayleigh fluctuation, with amplitudes correlated over each line 
but decorrelated from one line to the next. Hence, its correlation properties lie 
between Case 1 and Case 2.

Steps (5–8) are the same as steps (3–6) for integration, using Pc{D} in place of Pd{D}. 

170 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Integration is carried out over all m beams, as for other target models. How-
ever, the number of independent target samples used in step (2) is the number for 
a single line in the scan, as given by (5.34) and plotted in Figure 5.7. (The samples 
are actually those in the central column of beams, m = 2, 5, 8, but the symmetry is 
such that beams m = 4, 5, and 6 have the same correlation properties.) The steps in 
integration are then equivalent to those of the 1-D scan on a Case 2 target. 
Calculations for cumulative detection start in step (1) with the steady-target 
detection probability for each individual beam. A cumulative probability for the 
steady target in each scan line is given by step (2), and in step (3) this is integrated 
over the exponential distribution to obtain the single-line cumulative probability 
of the fluctuating target. This in turn is used in step (4) to find the cumulative 
probability over the three lines, whose signals are uncorrelated.  
As with the other target models, the signals can be processed in any of the 
three ways: integration over the scan, cumulative detection over the scan, or inte-
gration over each line (mixed processing). 
5.4.5.1 Diversity Target with Integration  
The beamshape loss for the diversity target with integration is shown in Figure 
5.23. The losses for this target are almost indistinguishable from those of Case 2, 
which in turn is barely distinguishable from Case 1 when integration is used over 
the entire scan.  
5.4.5.2 Diversity Target with Cumulative Detection  
The diversity target loss with cumulative detection over the entire scan is shown 
in Figure 5.24. The optimum spacing for P = 0.9 is   0.9, where Lp2 = 5.3 dB, 
and the optimum shifts upward with decreasing Pd to   1.15 for Pd = 0.3.

5.4.5.3 Diversity Target with Mixed Processing 
The diversity target loss with mixed processing is shown in Figure 5.25. The loss 
is very similar to that of the Case 2 target. The optimum spacing for Pd = 0.9 is 
 = 0.85, where the loss is 4.7 dB. Spacings  > 1.3 introduce losses that are not 
tolerable for applications requiring high Pd.

Beamshape Loss in the Search Radar Equation for 2-D Raster Scan

This loss includes the effect of reapportioning the energy transmitted during the 
search frame time into the larger or smaller number of beams required as the spac-
ing is varied. The net effect of reapportionment of energy and beamshape loss is 
shown in Figures 5.26 and 5.27 for Case 1 and Case 2 targets with cumulative 
detection. The data suggest that the optimum beam spacing is  > 1 for both tar-
gets with cumulative detection. It can be seen that relatively sparse sampling is 
advantageous, especially for Case 2, even when high Pd is required.  
Integration of signals gathered over a 2-D scan that covers a large sector may 
not be easily implemented (e.g., on high-velocity targets that may move through 
the range resolution cell during the scan period). More practical is mixed pro-

cessing: integration over contiguous beams on each line in the raster, with succes-
sive lines combined by cumulative detection over the scan. The net beamshape 
loss for this case is shown in Figures 5.28 and 5.29 for Case 1 and Case 2 targets.  
Not considered in these comparisons of net beamshape loss is the advantage 
of greater accuracy in angle estimation for scans with dense sampling. When 
track-while-scan techniques are used to form track files with the detection data 
from overlapping beams, the improved accuracy may justify the extra energy re-
quired. However, when designing a search scan to minimize both power and time, 
it appears that spacings of one beamwidth or more are advantageous. In systems 
that can assign validation and track initiation beams immediately after the first 
detection, the range at which track initiation occurs with probability Ptrack can be 
extended to the range that gives a cumulative probability of detection equal to

Ptrack over several scans. A further advantage of using several scans with the re-
duced scan time of sparse sampling is that fluctuating targets will normally be-
come decorrelated from scan to scan, reducing the fluctuation loss. 
5.5 
SPARSE SAMPLING USING A TRIANGULAR GRID 
The geometry for the triangular grid is similar to that for the rectangular grid, Sec-
tion 5.4, but the beams in successive scan lines are offset from each other in the x 
coordinate by 0.5, and the y coordinate spacing is reduced from  to 
0.75 to 
form the equilateral triangles shown in Figure 5.30. The target locations occupy 
one quadrant of the central beam, but the vertical spacing has been changed by a 
factor 
0.75  relative to those in the rectangular raster. The results is a more uni-
form distribution of energy within the scan sector, and reduced beamshape loss. 
The method of calculation follows that for the rectangular grid, but with the fol-
lowing changes.

and a loss denoted by LpT2 rather than Lp2. The upper limits for m and j are 9 and 
25, respectively. The beam spacing  varies from 0.5 to 1.5 beamwidths, as for 
the rectangular grid, but now applies to the length of each side of the equilateral 
triangle shown in Figure 5.35.

Steady-Target Beamshape Loss for Triangular Grid 
Results for this target model are not presented here, as it is seldom applicable to 
actual radar. Analytic approximations to the loss are presented in Appendix 5A. 
5.5.3 
Case 1 Beamshape Loss for Triangular Grid 
5.5.3.1 Case 1 with Integration 
The beamshape loss for Case 1 with integration is shown in Figure 5.31. The loss 
for high Pd is substantially less than that shown in Figure 5.15 for the rectangular 
grid. The additional power required for the closer spacing of adjacent rows is 
1
0.75  or 0.63 dB, and the reduction in loss for Pd = 0.9 is 2 dB at  = 1.2. The 
apparent slight rise for   0.5 results from failure to include contributions from 
beyond the nine-beam grid shown in Figure 5.30, whose inclusion is assumed in 
calculation of the reference detectability factor. Extension of integration over 
those beams might or might not actually occur in a practical processing system. 
5.5.3.2 Case 1 with Cumulative Detection 
The loss for Case 1 with cumulative detection is shown in Figure 5.32. Again, the 
loss for high Pd and  > 1.1 is substantially lower than for the rectangular grid.

Case 2 Beamshape Loss for Triangular Grid 
The number of independent samples for Case 2 is slightly increased by the closer 
spacing of rows in the scan, compared with the rectangular grid, resulting in a

5.5.6 
Beamshape Loss in Search Radar Equation for Triangular Grid  
For use in the search radar equation, the net beamshape loss is calculated on the 
basis of maintaining constant energy over the scan as beam spacing changes. This 
loss is shown in Figures 5.42–5.44 for the diversity target with three methods of 
processing. The results for this target model are approximately equal to those for 
Cases 1 and 2, and provide a basis for estimating the effects of different spacing of 
samples. 
The major conclusion from Figures 5.42–5.44 is that the net beamshape loss 
to be included in the search radar equation for a 2-D scan with a triangular grid 
must significantly exceed the value Lp2 = 1.77 = 2.48 dB commonly used for 
dense sampling. Given the usual spacing of 0.71 beamwidth, the loss will vary 
from 7.5 dB for mixed processing to 8.5 dB for cumulative detection. Achieving 
the minimum loss of 2–4 dB requires that the spacing be increased to  1.3 beam-

but would significantly decrease the time required to scan a given search volume. 
This might be an advantage, especially in the case of multifunction radars that 
follow up on an initial detection with an immediate track acquisition process.

SUMMARY OF BEAMSHAPE LOSS 
5.6.1 
Beamshape Loss for Dense Sampling 
Sample spacing  < 0.71 beamwidth in the scanned coordinate constitutes dense 
sampling. The loss for dense sampling in one coordinate is Lp0 = 1.33 = 1.24 dB 
for any target type and processing using integration or cumulative detection. For 
2-D scanning it is Lp2 = L2
p0 = 1.77 = 2.48 dB. Separate integration loss (see Sec-

10.2.5) is included in the usual forms of the radar equation. 
5.6.2 
Beamshape Loss for Sparse Sampling 
Sample spacing  > 0.71 beamwidth in the scanned coordinate constitutes sparse 
sampling. The loss for sparse sampling is a function of spacing , detection prob-
ability Pd, target type, and processing method.  
5.6.2.1 One-Dimensional Scanning 
Figures 5.45 and 5.46 illustrate the variation in 1-D beamshape loss between 
steady and Case 1 fluctuating targets for integration and cumulative detection. For 
sparse sampling the loss is seen to be much more dependent on Pd for the steady 
target than for Case 1.

5.6.2.2 Two-Dimensional Scan with Rectangular Grid 
The beamshape loss for 2-D scan with a rectangular grid is shown in Figures 5.47 
and 5.48 for integration and cumulative detection. In both cases the loss is approx-
imately the square (twice the decibel value) of the corresponding 1-D loss at high 
Pd. For the steady target at Pd = 0.5, the 2-D loss exceeds that relationship. 
5.6.2.3 Two-Dimensional Scanning with Triangular Grid 
Location of beams on an equilateral triangular grid, with scan lines offset by half 
the spacing in the rapid-scan coordinate and spaced by 
0.75  beamwidth in the 
other coordinate, substantially reduces beamshape loss. The energy required to

obtain a given beam-axis snr is increased by only 0.6 dB for this scan. The loss for 
sparse sampling increases much more slowly than with the rectangular grid, espe-
cially for high Pd, as shown in Figures 5.49 and 5.50. In these plots, the reference 
detectability factor has been adjusted to account for the additional energy re-
quired, so the loss for integration remains 2Lp0 = 2.48 dB in the transition to dense 
sampling. The difference between the two grids is more extreme for the steady 
target than for Case 1 as shown in these figures. 
5.6.3 
Processing Methods 
Three processing methods have been considered in calculating beamshape loss: 
integration of samples from each beam dwell, combination of detection probabili-
ties from each dwell into a cumulative probability of detection, and (for 2-D scan)

Beamshape Loss

a mixed process in which detection is performed on signals integrated over each 
scan line, with results combined in a cumulative probability of detection over suc-
cessive lines. 
The use of integration (either coherent or noncoherent) is obviously the most 
efficient of the three methods, but it may not be possible on 2-D scans that cover 
large sectors. When each line of the scan requires a time longer than the correla-
tion time of the target (see Section 4.5.2), coherent integration cannot be per-
formed beyond a single line. When the scan time for a line exceeds the time in 
which the target stays within a range or Doppler resolution cell, even noncoherent 
integration becomes difficult. It is possible to perform integration over a string of 
cells that follow the target dynamics (so-called retrospective, or “track-before-
detect” processing), but this requires much higher processing power than conven-
tional integration within each cell. Hence, the mixed processing option may be 
substituted. 
Mixed processing performs integration over each line, but combines results of 
successive lines through the process of cumulative detection. Since there are not 
normally more than two or three scan lines in which the target appears, the loss 
from the cumulative process is moderate (see Section 10.2.5). The plots of 
beamshape loss using this procedure include the cumulative detection loss. For 
spacing  = 0.5 beamwidth, there are basically four beams with significant target 
energy (two per line, over two lines). Integration within the line provides a gain 
approaching 3 dB, and the cumulative process gains an additional 1–1.5 dB, leav-
ing 1.5–2 dB of cumulative loss relative to ideal integration. Thus, the plotted 
results show a total beamshape loss of 4–4.5 dB at  = 0.5, of which the basic 
dense sampling loss 2Lp0 = 2.5 dB. 
The least efficient process is to make a detection decision within each dwell, 
with no dwell-to-dwell memory but an increase in cumulative detection probabil-
ity over all dwells that contain target signals. The curves typically show a total 
beamshape loss of 6 dB at  = 0.5, of which the basic dense-sampling loss 
2Lp0 = 2.5 dB, the other 3.5 dB being attributable to the cumulative process.  
Not all scan patterns use regular rasters such as the rectangular or triangular 
grid. Acquisition scans for a tracking radar may use arbitrary clusters of beams 
centered on the designated target position. In general, the beamshape loss for such 
scans can be estimated using the data obtained for triangular 2-D scan grids (e.g., 
Figures 5.31–5.44) with the spacing and the processing method by which the sig-
nals are combined in the acquisition scan. 
5.6.4 
Net Beamshape Loss for the Search Radar Equation 
In the loss budget for the search radar equation, the net beamshape loss Lpn1 (Sec-
tion 5.3.5) or Lpn2 (Sections 5.4.6, 5.5.6) replaces the product of Lp0 or Lp2 and the 

186 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
cumulative detection loss. The result is to multiply the loss values plotted in this 
summary by a factor 1/ (for 1-D scan), 1/2 (for 2-D scan with rectangular grid), 
or 
2
1
0.75 (for 2-D scan with triangular grid). The result is to increase the 
contribution of net beamshape loss for the normally used sample spacings  < 1. 
For example, at  = 0.71, the loss for 1-D scan is not Lp0 = 1.24 dB but rather 
Lpn = 3–4 dB, depending on the target model and processing (see Figures 5.10–
5.13). For 2-D scan these values increase to L2
pn = 6–12 dB (see Figures 5.26–5.29 
and 5.42–5.44), well above L2
p0 = 2.48 dB (or the 3.2 dB derived from Blake’s 
work). Part of the net beamshape loss is explained by inclusion of the cumulative 
detection.  
The minimum net beamshape loss appears in all cases at   1, even for 
Pd  0.9, suggesting that sparse sampling provides a more efficient search mode 
than the conventional   0.71. As noted earlier, however, this efficiency may 
compromise the angular accuracy of the target data. 
5.6.5 
Beamshape Loss for Unequally Spaced 2-D Scan 
All the 2-D beamshape loss data presented above are based on the assumption that 
sample spacings, in beamwidths, were either equal in the two coordinates or were 
on equilateral triangles. Where this condition is not met, an approximation of the 
loss can be made in either of two ways. For a rectangular grid, the loss is approx-
imately the product (sum, in decibels) of the 1-D loss values for the two spacings. 
Alternatively, and for the triangular grid, the loss may be estimated by averaging 
the decibel values of the 2-D losses calculated for the two spacings.  
If more accurate data are needed, the procedures described in Sections 5.4.1, 
5.4.2, and 5.5.1 may be modified to include the two spacings.

Analytical Approximations for Beamshape Loss 
While the calculation procedures presented in Sections 5.3.1–5.3.7 yield accurate 
estimates of beamshape loss, they can be time-consuming and impractical for in-
clusion in radar analysis programs. The following approximations were derived to 
match the calculated beamshape loss with a beam from a cosine-illuminated rec-
tangular aperture. That pattern was used rather than the Gaussian beam because it 
better captures the increased loss from sparse sampling that results from the steep 
slope as the target approaches the first null on each side of the mainlobe. The ap-
proximations give Lp to within 0.1–0.2 dB for each case discussed in the previous 
sections, merging with the dense-sampling value as the spacing   0.71. Primed 
symbols denote values in decibels, and the dense-sampling value for 1-D scan is 
denoted by Lp0.

In the subsequent equations, the term C(Pd,) represents the difference between 
the spacing  and the spacing at which minimum loss occurs for given Pd. The 
loss follows different functions, defined by A(Pd,), for positive and negative val-
ues of this term.

CHAPTER 6 
System Noise Temperature 
6.1 
NOISE IN THE RADAR BANDS 
A significant contribution made by Blake [1–3] is his treatment of noise in radar 
receiving systems. The reader is referred to the referenced publications for a thor-
ough discussion. Two major points on the subject are: 
Thermal and quasi-thermal noise cannot be eliminated or filtered out by any special circuitry 
or devices, while many manmade noises can be. Although the signal-to-thermal-noise ratio 
can be maximized by good receiver design and optimum signal processing, the residual ther-
mal noise still imposes a fundamental limit on how small a signal can be detected.  
A basic cause of the voltage fluctuation known as electrical noise is thermal agitation of elec-
trons in imperfect conductors. The phenomenon of temperature, according to the science of 
thermodynamics, is the result of the kinetic energy (motion) of particles of mattersolid, liq-
uid, or gaseous. 
[3, pp. 131–132] 
6.1.1 
Noise Spectral Density 
Radio noise originates in a conductor of resistance R ohms at thermodynamic 
temperature T, which generates thermal noise with uniform power spectral density 
N0 over a broad RF band. Exact quantum mechanical analysis gives a noise power 
density that is a function of frequency and temperature:

where 
h = 6.63 1034 W·s2 is Planck’s constant;  
f0 = frequency in Hz; 
k = 1.38 1023 W·s is Boltzmann’s constant. 

198 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The frequency-independent (white-noise) approximation in (6.1) is obtained by 
expanding the exponential, assuming that hf0/kT << 1, and retaining only the first 
two terms of the expansion: 
 


0
0
exp
1
hf
kT
hf
kT

 
(6.2) 
The error in approximation is 0.1 dB for f0/T = 109, corresponding to X-band (10 
GHz) at 10K temperature, and for W-band (100 GHz) at 100K. It increases to 
1.1 dB for f0/T = 1010, corresponding to W-band at 10K. Hence the approxima-
tion is adequate for almost all radar calculations, and will be used here. The full 
expression (6.1) is needed in the terahertz, infrared, and optical bands. 
The noise spectral density N0 used in the radar equation is referred to the out-
put port of the receiving antenna, where the system noise temperature Ts is defined 
for entry into (6.1). The receiver that accepts signals from the antenna is charac-
terized by its frequency response H( f ) and noise bandwidth Bn, defined as

where f0 is the center frequency of the response. 
Given the noise bandwidth Bn and a power gain G measured to a specific 
point in the receiver chain, the noise power at that point is

It is customary in analysis of radar performance, as opposed to circuit design, to 
simplify discussions by setting R = 1, thereby expressing power simply as the 
square of voltage. 
6.1.2 
Noise Statistics 
The probability density function (pdf) of thermal noise voltage is Gaussian [3, p. 
135, Eq. (4.8)]:

where  is the rms value of the noise voltage.1 The average voltage is zero. Blake 
states [3, p. 135] that “quasi-thermal noise” introduced by some radio circuits is 
“virtually indistinguishable from thermal noise within the passband of a radar re-
ceiver,” and can be modeled as thermal noise. Ultrawideband (UWB) radar may 
require use of different spectral and statistical treatment of noise. 
Video noise (envelope detected Gaussian noise) has a Rayleigh distribution:

1  In [3, Eq. (4.8)], a typographical error in the D. C. heath edition, corrected in the subsequent Artech 
edition, places 22 instead of 22 in the denominator of the exponential. In the subsequent integra-
tion for the rms value of En the lower limit of integration is given as 0 rather than the correct value 
, in both editions. The lower limit is correctly zero in integrations for video noise.

6.2 
SOURCES OF NOISE IN RADAR RECEPTION 
Sources of noise in a radar receiving system are shown in Figure 6.1. The first 
radar element through which the received signal passes is the antenna. Its pattern 
has lobes that are directed partly toward the sky and partly toward the surface. 
Noise sources in the sky include molecules of the tropospheric gases, ions at alti-
tudes above the troposphere, cosmic sources, and sometimes solar radiation. The 
physical temperature of the troposphere is coupled to an RF noise temperature by 
the one-way attenuation L1 applicable to passage of a ray from space through the 
troposphere, contributing the sky noise Ta. Antenna pattern lobes reaching the 
Earth’s surface accept noise from molecular agitation of the surface material that 
is at a physical temperature Tg, along with sky noise reflected from the surface. 
Within the antenna are resistive elements whose loss La contributes to the antenna 
noise temperature Ta, which is measured at the antenna output terminal. This is the 
reference point to which system noise temperature Ts is referred. 
Each subsequent hardware element through which the received signal passes 
contains additional sources of noise. These are referred to the antenna terminal, 
and are grouped into two terms: Tr, the contribution of RF elements that introduce 
a loss Lr between the antenna terminal and the receiver input, and LrTe, the contri-
bution of the receiver (and possibly subsequent circuits), increased by the loss Lr 
to refer Te to the antenna terminal. The system noise temperature is given by

tion of the terms in (6.10) for different environments and radar types. 
The noise temperature contributed in passing through a circuit element or 
path with loss L can be referred to the input of that element as

These relationships are used to calculate noise temperature components at succes-
sive stages in the receiving path. 
6.3 
ANTENNA NOISE TEMPERATURE 
The antenna noise temperature Ta is the result of the loss within the antenna itself 
and several noise sources in the environment surrounding the antenna. Early forms 
of the radar equation assumed Ta  300K. Blake’s work was instrumental in refin-
ing that assumption, and providing a method of assigning to Ta an accurate value 
that is often a small fraction of the “standard temperature” T0 = 290K used in de-
fining receiver noise figure. 
6.3.1 
Sources of Antenna Noise Temperature 
6.3.1.1 Transmitted Power Coupling to Environment 
The contributions of the antenna and its environment to Ta may be identified by 
looking outward from the antenna port, considering the way in which transmitted 
power applied to that port would be distributed among four dissipative loads, and 
invoking reciprocity to apply that same distribution to the input noise. In Figure 
6.2, a power of 1W enters the antenna from the right and is split into four compo-
nents. An initial power divider routes power 1/La < 1W into radiation from the 
antenna, while the remaining Pa4 = 1  1/La goes the ohmic loss La within the an-
tenna. The radiated power in turn is divided between two angular regions: a frac-
tion as appears in lobes that reach the surface (the lower hemisphere), while 1  as 
is directed to the sky (the upper hemisphere). The power radiated directly toward 
the sky is Pa1 = (1  as)/La, while as/La goes to the surface. When the radar beam 
axis is elevated to an elevation angle b > 0, only the lower sidelobes, and possibly 
the lower skirt of the mainlobe, contribute to as. 
For a surface with the surface reflection coefficient , a fraction 2 of the 
power reaching the surface is reflected upwards toward space, while 1  2 is ab-
sorbed. The power absorbed in the surface is Pa3 = as(1  2)/La. The upward 
component is Pa2 = as2/La, and this is added to Pa1 in the sky in front of the an-
tenna. A fraction 1/L1 of Pa1 + Pa2 passes outward through the galaxy to the cos-

202 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
mos, while the fraction 1  1/L1 is absorbed by the one-way tropospheric attenua-
tion L1 (see Chapter 7). Thus the sky component is divided between power dissi-
pated in the troposphere and power passing into space. The ionosphere need not 
be considered, because it has negligible attenuation at frequencies above 300 
MHz. Even at 100 MHz the maximum ionospheric loss of 1 dB makes a negligi-
ble contribution to noise, compared with galactic sources. 
Blake in [3] considers the issue of upward reflections from the surface, in 
terms of a reflectivity R and emissivity E, but provides little guidance as to how 
these terms should be evaluated. Formulation using the reflection coefficient , 
calculated in Section 8.3 for different surfaces, polarizations, and grazing angles, 
provides a practical procedure that is used here. 
6.3.1.2 Environmental Noise Coupling to Antenna Port 
For a system in thermal equilibrium, the principle of reciprocity establishes that 
the thermal noise received from the galaxy, the troposphere, the surface, and the 
antenna loss will be combined at the antenna output port, each noise component 
weighted by the same coefficients that control the transmitted power distribution. 
Figure 6.3 illustrates this receiving process.  
Four sources of noise, entering from the left, are coupled to the antenna out-
put port. These are the troposphere, at physical temperature T; the cosmos at Tc; 
the surface at TG; and the antenna loss at Tp. The physical temperatures are the 
temperatures of the molecules contributing the noise, as distinguished from the 
resulting RF noise temperature. The temperature components from the tropo-
sphere and galaxy are added to form sky noise Ta, which enters directly into the 
antenna lobes of the upper hemisphere with weight 1  as. It is further weighted 
by 1/La to form the first noise temperature component Ta1:

6.3.2.1 Tropospheric Noise Temperature T 
Molecules of atmospheric gas and water vapor in a tropospheric volume element 
emit part of their thermal energy as electromagnetic noise with a density given by 
(6.1), in which T represents the noise temperature of the element. An antenna lobe 
at elevation angle   0 from a receiving antenna at altitude hr passes through el-
ements of the troposphere at altitudes h above sea level that increase with range r 
approximately as 
                                                           
2  But note that a recently discovered 5th component will be discussed in Section 6.3.5. 
3  Blake [3, p. 168] uses the symbol TG for the physical temperature of the surface, as we do here. On 
p. 171 he uses that same symbol for the product asTG, and [3, Eq. (4.76)] includes Tg = asTG, which 
becomes 36K in [3, (4.76a)].

The variation in physical temperature of the tropospheric gases as a function 
of h can be described using the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere [4, p. 14-3] dis-
cussed in Section 7.1.2 and shown in Figure 6.4.  
The noise temperature over an incremental distance along the path at angle  
is the product of the tropospheric temperature and attenuation over that distance, 
and its contribution to antenna noise temperature is proportional to that product, 
reduced by the attenuation over the earlier portion of the path. This is the basis of 
Blake’s analysis that led to the expression for antenna temperature [3, p. 165, Eq. 
(4.65)]:

where k1( f0,h) is the one-way attenuation coefficient in dB/km of the troposphere 
at frequency f0 and altitude h. The constant 0.2303 = 0.1 ln(e) multiplies the outer 
integral to give the noise temperature in kelvins generated in passage of the beam 
through the entire atmosphere into space. The exponential with argument 0.2303 
times the inner integral gives the fraction of this temperature reaching the antenna 
from range r, after attenuation in the intervening troposphere. The effect is to de-
crease the contribution from higher altitudes of the troposphere. 
The one-way attenuation coefficient k1 in dB/km is found from the two-way 
coefficient k, which is:

A computational problem in application of (6.21) results from the need to find 
h(r,) by the ray-tracing integral, followed by root-finding to solve for r(h,). 
This is then integrated over r, and the entire process repeated for the integration 
over r. A practical procedure that introduces only slight error in the evaluation of 
T uses the effective Earth radius approach to obtain a closed-form expression

By avoiding the ray-tracing and root-finding within each integral, the time re-
quired for the nested integration is greatly reduced. Plots of sky temperature as 
functions of frequency and beam elevation angle, such as Figure 6.7, can then be 
generated for any selected atmospheric model.

in the presence of precipitation requires the appropriate two-way attenuation coef-
ficient kr( f0,h) for rain or ks( f0,h) for snow, determined from data in Sections 
7.3.1 or 7.3.4. The one-way values

The galactic component of noise is greatest within  2 of the plane of our galaxy 
(the Milky Way). The noise temperature thus depends on the direction of the an-
tenna lobe with respect to that plane and center of the galaxy. The model for ga-
lactic noise temperature [3, p. 162, Eq. (4.60)] is based on a reference temperature 
T0.1 that is measured at f = 0.1 GHz:

where f0 is in GHz. The reference level varies with direction over the following 
limits: 
T0.1max  = 18,650K at the center of the galaxy; 
T0.1mid = 3,050K elsewhere in the galactic plane; 
T0.1min  = 500K outside the galactic plane. 
The second component of cosmic noise is a constant Tsp = 2.7K, making only a 
small contribution.  
The angles of the beam axis relative to the plane and center of the galaxy are 
unpredictable, so radar analysis is normally carried out using T0.1mid = 3,050K in 
the mainlobe. The maximum value may be substituted for a conservative estimate 
of performance. In any case, the contribution of galactic noise to the final system 
noise temperature for microwave radar is insignificant, amounting to less than 
10K at S-band.  
The solar contribution is calculated using the noise brightness temperature TB 
of the quiet sun’s disc, based on calculations made by Blake, as shown in Figure 

208

6.5. The solar disk as observed from the Earth has an angular diameter of 0.5, 
corresponding to a solid angle s = 5.98  105 steradian.

The approximation applies when the sun lies in a far-sidelobe region where the 
gain is uniform at a level Gfar. Even for an antenna with a relatively high far-
sidelobe level (e.g., Gfar = 5 dB), Tsun < 2K at f0  0.1 GHz, and this component is 
negligible. Larger sidelobes or the mainlobe see significant increases for the quiet 
sun, especially in the lower radar bands. During sunspot activity, temperatures up 
to ten times the level of the quiet sun may be observed over periods of several 
hours. Solar noise is thus a problem in limited angular regions and for brief time 
periods, and is usually omitted from radar analysis. 
6.3.2.4 Total Sky Temperature Ta 
The total sky temperature Ta, given by (6.19), is shown in Figure 6.6 as a function 
of frequency, for different beam elevation angles. Elevation beamwidths e > 1 
require use of an average over the elevation angles within the mainlobe, weighted 
by the antenna power gain for each angle.

6.3.3 
Noise Temperature from the Surface  
The surface in which the noise component Ta3 originates is generally assumed to 
be at a physical temperature TG = T0 = 290K. A different local value may be used 
to account for extreme climatic conditions, but variation from 290K is small when 
compared with uncertainty in the fraction as of the antenna pattern that accepts the 
surface noise. In his approximate expression, Blake assigns a value as = 0.124 for 
that fraction, obtaining a surface noise temperature TGas(1  2) = 36K.  
Given the more recent developments in low-sidelobe antennas and array sys-
tems, it is appropriate to evaluate the fraction more exactly for the antenna pattern 
of a specific radar. For a power directivity pattern G(A,), defined over the entire 
hemisphere surrounding the antenna and normalized to unity total radiated power 
is

Figure 6.7 shows the results of applying (6.28) to patterns of a cosine-
illuminated aperture with 2 beamwidth and with uniform far-sidelobe levels 5, 
10, and 15 dBi. The normalization of the curves to the beamwidth makes them 
applicable to most radar antennas. With the axis of a symmetrical beam directed 
horizontally, 50% of the power from an antenna at low altitude reaches the sur-
face. Upward tilt of the beam axis to one beamwidth reduces the fraction of power 
on the surface to the level set by the far sidelobes, which is 13.5%, 5.2%, and 
1.8% for the three sidelobe levels plotted. If the antenna is a front-fed reflector, 
about half the spillover power is added to the surface fraction, which may increase 
as from values calculated here using theoretical patterns for the illumination func-
tion. Ultralow-sidelobe reflector antennas, discussed in [5, pp. 175–179], are de-
signed to minimize spillover and other sources of surface illumination, which may 
approach the curve for 15 dBi far sidelobes.

System Noise Temperature 
211 
Radars operating over barren land or the sea, for which the reflection coeffi-
cient  in (6.17) approaches unity, observe reduced surface noise temperature. As 
pointed out in Section 8.3, the specular reflection coefficient is the product of 
three factors: 
 
0
s
v
 
(6.29) 
where 
0 = Fresnel reflection coefficient of the surface material; 
s = specular scattering factor of a rough surface; 
v = vegetation factor for the surface cover. 
Only the factors 0 and v should be included in applying (6.29) to (6.17), because 
the diffuse scattering that results for s < 1 appears in a narrow cone centered on 
the specular ray in the upper hemisphere, and is unlikely to spread far enough for 
significant power to reach the surface. Horizontal polarization gives 0 near unity 
over most grazing angles, resulting in less absorption by the surface and lower 
surface-temperature than for vertical polarization. 
The beam of a 2-D search radar or the lowest beam of a 3-D radar typically 
has its axis elevated 0.3–0.4 beamwidths above the horizontal, resulting in 
as = 0.2–0.3. In a 2-D radar using a csc2 pattern, the fraction of the pattern reach-
ing the surface is reduced by Lcsc, the csc2 pattern loss (typically Lcsc  1.6; see 
Section 2.2.4) The upper beams of 3-D radars are more than one beamwidth above 
the surface, as are tracking-radar beams on most targets. For those cases it is the 
far sidelobe level that controls as, as shown on the right side of Figure 6.7. 
6.3.4 
Noise Temperature from Antenna Ohmic Loss   
The term ohmic loss is used to distinguish loss components that dissipate energy 
in the antenna structure from those that broaden the beam (e.g., illumination loss) 
or increase sidelobes (e.g., loss from csc2 pattern shaping or from phase and am-
plitude errors in the aperture illumination). Components contributing to the anten-
na loss La include waveguide or transmission line between the antenna port and 
radiation into space, along with rotary joints, dielectric coverings or windows, 
phase shifters (in steerable arrays), and any resistive components to which signal 
energy may be coupled. 
The fourth component Ta4 of antenna noise results from this internal loss. It is 
usually small in reflector or lens antennas, for which typical La  0.05 dB and 
physical temperature Tp  T0. Insertion of those values in (6.16) gives Ta4 = 13K. 
It is a more significant source of noise temperature in array systems, where con-
tributors to ohmic loss may be larger, as discussed below. Array components are 
usually assumed to be at a temperature Tp  T0, but may be higher as a result of 

212 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
dissipation of RF power from the transmitter and control power in the phase-
shifters. In active electronically scanned arrays (AESAs), the effects of feed and 
phase-shifter losses are negligible because those components follow the LNA in 
the T/R module. 
6.3.4.1 Feed Loss 
In a passive array, whether electronically or mechanically scanned, the antenna 
elements are connected to the receiver through networks of power combiners that 
establish the desired illumination (or weighting) function across the aperture. Ar-
ray designers minimize the dissipative loss by using waveguide in the feed com-
ponents and coupling as much energy as possible into the signal output, but the 
remaining loss is still significant in most array radars (other than AESAs).  
6.3.4.2 Phase Shifter Loss 
The passive electronically scanned array requires a phase shifter in the feed line of 
each radiating element. Phase shifter loss is typically 0.7–1 dB for a ferrite device, 
or 1.0–1.5 dB for a diode device. That loss is multiplies (adds in dB) directly to 
the feed loss and other antenna losses. 
6.3.4.3 Loss from Water Films 
Precipitation or condensation may form a water film on components such as die-
lectric covers on the array face or feed horn, the exposed surface of a reflector, or 
a radome covering the entire antenna. The loss in liquid water films is discussed in 
Section 10.1.5. Ice and snow crystals have relatively low loss, but as melting oc-
curs they may contain liquid water with high loss. A water film on a reflector sur-
face has only small effect, because the electric field falls to zero at the surface and 
there is little coupling between RF energy and the water.  
6.3.5 
Noise Temperature from Antenna Mismatch 
Figure 6.8 shows the components contributing to the noise temperature Ta of a 
mismatched antenna. Matching the impedance of the radiating element to space 
and to the line that connects to the circulator maximizes the echo signal power and 
minimizes the noise temperature. Brookner [6] discusses the contribution of mis-
match to noise temperature for both reflector and array antennas. 

 
System Noise Temperature 
213 
The external portion of the noise temperature Text = Ta1 + Ta2 + Ta3 at the an-
tenna output appears in (6.17), and also (increased by the factor La) at the input in 
Figure 6.8. The temperature Ta4 is from ohmic loss La, while Tr and Te are the re-
ceiving line and receiver temperatures (see Sections 6.4 and 6.5). The physical 
temperature Tp is that of the receiving line losses Lr and Lt. The physical tempera-
ture characterizing termination within the transmitter (in the absence of the trans-
mitted pulse) is Tpt. This differs from the presentation in [6], where the transmitter 
is represented by a resistive load at physical temperature Tp, without considering 
the possibility of higher transmitter temperature. Also, the antenna loss La in [6] is 
placed between the mismatch and the radiating element, rather than between the 
mismatch and the antenna output terminal as in Figure 6.8.

the circulator is

The appearance of La
2 in these expressions results from the two-way passage of the 
transmitter noise through the lossy components of the antenna. The term Ta5 is a 
new temperature component not included in Blake’s analysis, but potentially sig-
nificant in radars using array antennas. 
6.3.5.1 Mismatched Mechanically Steered Antenna 
For unity VSWR, || = 0 and (6.32) reverts to (6.17). For a mechanically steered 
antenna with typical VSWR = 1.5, ||2 = 0.04, so the change in noise temperature 
is approximately 4% of the difference between transmitter temperature Ttr and 
external temperature. For the typical mechanically steered reflector or array, 
Tpt  T0, and this increase does not exceed 11K even as the external temperature 
Text  0. However, depending on transmitter design, Tpt may significantly exceed 
T0. In a solid-state transmitter, for example, Tpt can be taken as the junction tem-
perature of the final amplifier devices, which may approach 400K.  
6.3.5.2 Mismatched Electrically Steered Array (ESA) 
The significance of Brookner’s paper [6] is greatest when applied to the varying 
mismatch that results when an ESA is steered from broadside. The array area (pro-
jected normal to the beam axis) varies with the cosine of the steering angle . 
However, the typical element pattern Ge() has a gain given by

where   1.5 is typical. The departure of the exponent from unity describes the

For  = 1.5, this gives |(60)|2 = 0.32, so with Tpt  400K the increase in an-
tenna noise temperature from (6.33) can approach Ta5 = 120K in a system with 
low Text. For smaller scan angles the problem is less severe, but |(45)|2 = 0.19, 
and most ESAs reach that scan angle. The average increase in noise temperature

This average approaches 50K, as La and Text  0, for  = 1.5, max = 60.  
In the radar equation, the primary effects of the mismatch 0 are included as 
reductions in antenna gains Gt and Gr, and as () in the pattern-propagation fac-
tors for || > 0. However, neither the maximum nor the average noise temperature 
increase should be neglected in estimating performance of an ESA, and especially 
an AESA in which low system noise is relied upon to achieve a specified perfor-
mance. 
A recent text [7] discusses the temperature contribution of antenna mismatch, 
as well as the other sources of antenna noise, in the context of deep space commu-
nications. Because of the very low noise contributed to such a system by a receiv-
er using a maser or high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), for which 
Te < 10K, the space communication community has placed great emphasis on de-
sign and modeling methods for reducing antenna noise. The same considerations 
can be applied to radar systems in which the beam is elevated well above the hori-
zon and which are not subject to active jamming. 
6.3.6 
Approximation for Antenna Noise Temperature 
Given the complexity of the full expression for antenna noise temperature result-
ing from the preceding sections, Blake’s approximation (6.18) from [3, p. 172, Eq. 
(4.76a)] is often used:

(6.37) 
The assumptions applicable to this approximation are: 
Fraction of antenna pattern on surface: as = 0.124; 
Physical temperature of surface and antenna: TG = Tp = T0; 
Reflection coefficient of surface:  = 0; 
Noise temperature from lower hemisphere: Ta2 + Ta3 = asT0 = 36K; 
Antenna ohmic loss: La is constant and includes any mismatch effect. 
An example showing the difference between this approximation and the more 
exact treatment, consider the radar and environmental parameters listed in Table 
6.1. Comparing the results of the exact treatment with the approximation: 
Exact: 
Ta = 78K, 
Ts = 341K (based on as = 0.111); 
Approximation  Ta  88K,  
Ts  350K. 
If the csc2 loss is eliminated and the beam elevation is raised to 10 for an elevated 
3-D or tracking radar beam, the comparison gives the following temperatures: 
Exact: 
Ta = 48K, 
Ts = 311K (based on as = 0.175); 
Approximation  Ta  57K, 
Ts  320K.  
For both these cases, the approximation for antenna temperature is within 0.8 dB 
of the more exact calculation, and for system temperature it is within 0.15 dB, 
which is adequate for many purposes. It would be less accurate for an ultralow-
sidelobe antenna or a receiver with very low noise.

line itself, the duplexer receiving path, any additional receiver protection such as a 
solid-state limiter or attenuator (which may also be provided for gain control), an 
RF filter, and possibly a directional coupler used for test purposes.

frequencies. 
Referring Te to the antenna port, it is multiplied by the receiving line loss Lr to 
give the receiver contribution to system temperature in (6.10). 
6.5.1 
Noise in Cascaded Receiver Stages 
The radar receiver typically consists of the stages shown in Figure 6.9. The noise 
input power from the duplexer and receiving line is typically 110 to 115 dBm, 
corresponding to tenths of one microvolt in a 50-ohm circuit. Minimum detectable 
signal levels may approach this noise level. The low-noise amplifier (LNA) oper-
ates at the carrier frequency f0, and is designed with a low noise figure Fn1 1 dB, 
and gain G1 = 15 –20 dB. This brings the input noise several decibels above cir-
cuit noise at the mixer output, after a mixer loss of 6 dB. IF amplifier stages fol-
lowing the mixer increase the noise voltage at the envelope detector output to 

218 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
above the least bit of the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, typically tenths of one 
millivolt. The net receiver gain is in the order of 60 dB. 
Calculation of receiver noise temperature Te and noise figure Fn can be car-
ried out by considering the noise temperature Tej or noise figure Fnj of each of the 
m circuits that make up the receiver, where j = 1, 2, … m:

System Noise Temperature 
219 
Noise figures and gains are determined for different circuits as follows: 
For passive circuits: Fnj  = Lj  = 1/Gj;  
For a mixer:  
Fnj  = rLj,  = r/Gj, where r is the noise-temperature   
ratio [9, p. 33], typically 1.2 –2.0 = 2  1 dB; 
For amplifiers:  
Fnj and Gj are as specified in the table. 
The noise temperature Tej is calculated as T0(Fnj  1). Note that placing the RF 
filter after the LNA minimizes the effect of its loss, and that the IF stages after the 
preamplifier make an insignificant contribution to noise temperature in a typical 
receiver. In spite of the LNA gain of 20 dB, the mixer in this case makes a signifi-
cant contribution to the overall receive noise figure. 
6.5.2 
Input and Output Levels 
The output noise power from the receiver to the A/D converter is the product of 
input noise N = kTsBn and the net gain in the receiving path from the antenna, in-
cluding the factor 1/Lr. As an example, assume from the example radar of Table 
6.1 the values Ta = 79K, Lr = 1.0 dB, and Tr = 75K. The system noise temperature 
from (6.10) is:

Assuming a noise bandwidth Bn = 1 MHz, the corresponding noise power and rms 
noise voltage in a 50-ohm circuit at the antenna terminal are: 
N = kTsBn = 113.2 dBm, Enin = 0.49 V 
The net gain of the receiving system, from the antenna terminal to the detector 
output, is  
 
61.5  1.0 = 60.5 dB.  
The resulting output noise power is 
 
Nout = 113.2 + 60.5 = 52.7 dBm,  
and the corresponding rms output voltage is 
 
Enout = 0.52 mV (in a 50-ohm circuit).

Quantizing Noise 
Modern radars use digital signal processing in which the analog inputs are con-
verted to digital form either after downconversion to baseband, as shown in Figure 
6.8, or by direct conversion of the IF voltage. The A/D converter adds a quantiz-
ing noise voltage Eq to the thermal noise at the output:

b is the number of A/D bits that express the peak voltage that varies over 
Emax.  
The gain prior to the A/D converter is adjusted so that the rms noise voltage is

The dynamic range DR is defined as the ratio of (1) the average power of a

Both the quantizing noise temperature and the dynamic range vary inversely as q2, 
so the need for large dynamic range and small temperature contribution are in 
conflict.

for x = 2. Depending on the investment in the transmitter and antenna, selection of 
the gain prior to the A/D converter to achieve the dynamic range given by x = 2 is 
often the best choice in receiver design.

SUMMARY OF RECIVING SYSTEM NOISE 
6.6.1 
Thermal Noise Dependence on Carrier Frequency  
The noise spectral density resulting from an input noise temperature Ts, as calcu-
lated by the simple expression N0 = kTs, is correct to within 0.1 dB for receivers in 
which the ratio of carrier frequency to noise temperature f0/Ts  109 (e.g., X-band 
at 10K). The simple expression underestimates N0 by 1.1 dB for f0/Ts  1010 (e.g., 
W-band at 10K), and the error increases for larger ratios as may be encountered in 
terahertz and optical-band radar.

Applicability of Blake’s Method 
The many external and internal sources of radar noise are identified in this chap-
ter, and expressions given for estimating their contribution to input noise tempera-
ture. Blake’s method provides a sound basis for evaluation of the noise tempera-
ture, which he expresses in the form of (6.10). 
Blake also gives the approximation (6.18), based on 12.4% of the antenna 
pattern’s power lying in the lower hemisphere, which gives adequate results for 
most practical radar situations. 
6.6.3 
Refined Method for Modern Radar 
To refine Blake’s method and adapt it to modern radar situations, more exact 
models of the troposphere are used, and the contribution of the surface is refined 
in Section 6.3.3, accounting for the antenna’s elevation pattern and the reflection 
coefficient of the surface. The effect of antenna mismatch, especially significant 
in electronically steered arrays, is discussed in Section 6.3.5 and is based on 
Brookner’s recent work. The added noise temperature term from mismatch, in-
cluding the effect of transmitter temperature, typically approaches 120K at the 
edge of the scanned volume, or 50K when averaged over that volume.

Receiver and Quantization Noise Temperature 
The modeling of receiver noise, including the effect of quantization in an A/D 
converter at the output, is presented in Section 6.5. A new relationship between 
quantizing noise temperature, the number of bits in the A/D converter, and the 
dynamic range of the receiver is developed. This relationship justifies use of a 
simple expression for the available dynamic range:

CHAPTER 7 
Atmospheric Effects 
Atmosphere affects on radar propagation include:  
 Refraction (bending) of the rays between the radar and the target;  
 Attenuation the waves that travel those paths;  
 Rotation in the polarization of waves in the ionosphere (at frequencies below 
S- band).  
Attenuation and Faraday rotation have obvious relevance to the radar equation, 
but refraction must also be considered because the refracted ray from the radar lies 
above the geometric straight line to the target, reducing the attenuation relative to 
that applicable to the straight-line path. In addition, the bundle of rays leaving the 
radar within the elevation beamwidth is spread by greater bending in the lower 
portion of the beam, causing the power density to be reduced more than by the 
factor 1/R2 for free-space transmission.  
Blake in [1] presents a thorough treatment of the atmospheric effects that re-
mains valid today. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and update the 
data, discuss practical modeling and computational methods, and present the re-
sults in metric units and in graphical formats that improve reading accuracy and 
interpretation. 
7.1 
TROPOSPHERIC REFRACTION 
Blake’s method of calculating attenuation uses integration along paths determined 
by ray-tracing through the troposphere. A model for the tropospheric refractive 
index as a function of altitude is required, and we present alternative models that 

226 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
permit evaluation of different radar siting and weather effects in all radar frequen-
cy bands.  
7.1.1 
Refractive Index of Air 
The complex refractive index is defined [2] as: 
A dimensionless complex quantity, characteristic of a medium and so defined that its real part 
is the ratio of the phase velocity in free space to the phase velocity in the medium. The prod-
uct of the imaginary part of the refractive index and the free-space propagation constant is the 
attenuation constant of the medium. 
Refraction of radar waves in the troposphere depends on the real part n of the re-
fractive index, which is a function of temperature T, air pressure P, and partial 
pressure e of the water-vapor content.1  
The real part of the refractive index is usually expressed in terms of the re-
fractivity N, the departure of n from unity and given by [3, p. 7, Eq. (1.15)]:

Standard Atmosphere 
The standard atmosphere was defined by a committee of U.S. experts during the 
1950s, and the 1976 version [5] that remains in effect at this writing was updated 
by experts from NOAA, NASA, and USAF. It is identical to the ICAO 1964 
standard up to 32-km altitude and to the ISO 1973 standard up to 50 km. Tem-
perature and pressure data below 30-km altitude, shown in Figure 7.1, are relevant 
to radar. Note that the pressure profile is close to an exponential, although its 
slope changes at  11 km altitude.  
Temperature is characterized by three linear segments with slopes changing at 
11 km and 20 km. The parameters at sea level are: 
Temperature T(0) 
288K; 
Pressure P(0) 
1,013.25 mbar.

7.1.3 
Inclusion of Water Vapor 
The standard atmosphere does not specify the water-vapor content of the air, but 
the sea-level value for the standard atmosphere is 0 = 7.75 g/m3. This can be 
compared with the density of saturated water vapor, 12.8 g/m3 at 288K. When 
combined with the standard atmosphere, this leads to the following sea-level pa-
rameters  
Density of water vapor w0 
7.75 g/m3; 
Density of saturated water vapor wmax 12.8 g/m3; 
Relative humidity RH 
60 
%, 
Partial pressure of water vapor e0 
10.3 mbar (from (7.2); 
Partial pressure of dry air Pda0 
1,002.7 
mbar. 
The sea-level refractivity and its dry-air and water-vapor components can be cal-
culated using (7.1): 
Refractivity N0 
319.2 ppm; 
Dry-air refractivity Nd0 
70.1 ppm; 
Water-vapor refractivity Nw0 
49.1 ppm. 
Thus 85% of the sea-level refractivity results from the dry air and 15% from water 
vapor, even though the partial pressure of water vapor is only 1% of the total pres-
sure. 
Blake [1, p. 207] presented a vertical profile of measured w as a function of 
altitude, which can be scaled to the sea-level value w0 = 7.75 g/m3 to obtain Fig-
ure 7.2. The profile for water-vapor density can be expressed by a three-section 
model:

where the sea-level water-vapor density is w0 = 7.75 g/m3, for 60% relative hu-
midity in the standard atmosphere. Separate profiles must be used for air pressure 
and water-vapor density to account for the concentration of water vapor at low 
altitudes.  
7.1.4 
Vertical Profile of Refractivity 
Given profiles of T, P, and w, (7.3) is applied to obtain the refractivity profile of 
the standard atmosphere. In Figure 7.3 that profile is compared with a dashed line 
representing a single-section exponential fit to the low-altitude refractivity values 
that dominate the effect of the troposphere. This is one of a family of refractivity 
profiles known as the CRPL Exponential Reference Atmospheres, developed by 
the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory.3  
The CRPL Exponential Reference Atmospheres are defined by [3, p. 65, Eq. 
(3.43)]:

Oceanic and Atmosphere Agency (NOAA).

The CRPL models are based on many measurements conducted during the 
1950s. The dashed line in Figure 7.3 is for a surface refractivity Ns = 313 ppm, 
used by Blake [1, p. 183] as the average for the United States. The parameters 
presented in Table 7.1 are applicable to different site altitudes and weather condi-
                                                           
4  The scale height h0 in [1, 3] is expressed by its reciprocal c in km1, but the scale height h0 (defined 
as the altitude in km at which N falls to 1/e of its surface value) has a clear physical interpretation.

tions. The parameter ke represents the ratio of effective Earth’s radius to true radi-
us ae = 6,378 km, and ke = 4/3 is the value commonly used in radar calculations. 
The motivation for and development of the CRPL exponential reference at-
mospheres are discussed in detail in [6], which also presents climatic charts of the 
U. S. showing contours of refractivity for day and night conditions in February 
and August, adjusted to sea-level values N0. Extreme values on these charts are as 
follows: 
Maximum 
 N0  =  390 on the Gulf Coast on an August day; 
Minimum 
 N0  = 285 in southern Nevada on a February day.  
The entry Ns = 450 in Table 7.1 is observed only in hot, humid environments. The 
entry N0 = 200 is associated in [3] with an altitude of 3 km, near the maximum 
altitude for land-based radar. The U.S. average Ns = 313 is associated in the CRPL 
data with a surface altitude of 700 ft (213m), for which the corresponding sea-
level N0 = 323.  
The CRPL data suggest that 250  N0  400 covers the likely variation in sea-
level conditions, with N0  320 a nominal value. The refractive index profile for a 
given site altitude is then found from (7.6) using the selected N0. 
7.1.5 
Ray Paths in the Troposphere 
7.1.5.1 Ray-Tracing Method 
A ray leaving the radar at elevation angle 0 is gradually bent downward as a re-
sult of the decrease in the tropospheric refractive index with altitude h. The path is 
calculated for a known vertical profile of refractive index by ray-tracing, in which 
the range Rd = ctd/2, as measured by the time delay td of the radar echo, is given by 
[1, p. 182, Eq. (5.9)]:

In order to use the result of (7.8) in calculation of attenuation along the path, it 
must be inverted to yield altitude h(R,0). There is no closed-form equation for 
this, so root-finding methods must be used. 
7.1.5.2 Altitude Based on Effective Earth’s Radius 
The effective Earth’s radius keae is defined so that a ray leaving a radar antenna at 
altitude hs above sea level at elevation angle 0 reaches an altitude h at range R

For example, at R = 1,000 km the altitude error is less than 0.4% of the value from 
(7.9). The approximation permits attenuation calculations to be performed with 
acceptable accuracy over many ranges and elevation angles without the complexi-
ty of ray-tracing. 
7.2 
ATTENUATION IN THE TROPOSPHERE 
The attenuation for a radar path is expressed as the product of a two-way attenua-
tion coefficient in dB/km and the pathlength in km through the attenuating medi-
um. In the equations that follow, the two-way tropospheric attenuation coefficient 
denoted by k is used in place of , which in the referenced literature denotes the 
one-way coefficient in dB/km.  

 
Atmospheric Effects 
233 
7.2.1 
Sea-Level Attenuation Coefficients of Atmospheric Gases 
Attenuation results from the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, which 
varies with radar frequency f and with atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and 
water-vapor density . The relationships between these quantities and attenuation 
(absorption) were developed in an MIT Radiation Laboratory report by J. H. Van 
Vleck, condensed in [7]. That theory is used as the basis for the treatment in [3, 
Chapter 7] and by Blake [1, pp. 200–204].  
Oxygen and water vapor cause attenuation, both having strong, narrow ab-
sorption lines within the millimeter-wave spectrum (and at 22.2 GHz for water 
vapor). The absorption extends at lower levels throughout bands used by radar.  
7.2.1.1 Oxygen Attenuation 
The primary oxygen absorption lines are centered near fO1  60 GHz (O1 = 0.50 
cm). Rather than a single line, there are actually a sequence of resonances corre-
sponding to odd values of the rotational quantum number N, listed in Table 7.2 up 
to order 45, beyond which the contributions to attenuation are negligible. Note the 
well separated resonance at f1 = 118.75 GHz, which will appear in subsequent 
plots. 
The oxygen attenuation coefficient k0 was derived by Van Vleck [7 pp. 646–
656], whose equations as given in [1, pp. 200–201] (with the initial constant dou-
bled for two-way attenuation) are as follows:

7.2.2 
Variation of Attenuation Coefficients with Altitude 
The attenuation coefficients of oxygen and water vapor vary in different ways as 
the radar beam passes upwards through the troposphere. The atmospheric and 
geometric models developed in Section 7.1 provide the data needed to calculate 
the attenuation on a path to a target, or through the entire atmosphere into space.  
Equations (7.11)–(7.21) for attenuation coefficients include several terms that 
depend on altitude above sea level. We can find the coefficients for any altitude 
within the troposphere using vertical profiles of pressure P(h), temperature T(h) 
and water-vapor density w(h) given by (7.4), Figure 7.1(b), and (7.5). Typical 
results are shown in Figure 7.7, for altitudes h = 0, 3 km, and 10 km. Note that the 
attenuation at resonant frequencies is reduced much more slowly than the 
nonresonant term as altitude increases. For this reason, a simple scaling of atten-
uation coefficients with altitude or atmospheric pressure cannot be used. Instead, 
the attenuation must be calculated by integration over the actual ray path, using 
coefficients that vary with altitude. 
7.2.3 
Attenuation Through the Troposphere 
The total two-way attenuation Lt(hm) along a path leaving the radar at elevation 
angle 0 and reaching altitude hm km is given by [1, p. 209, Eq. (5.46)]:

Attenuation to Range R 
Attenuation L(R,) for a path to range R at beam elevation  can be found by

7.2.5 
Attenuation for Dry and Moist Atmospheres 
Attenuation data are sometimes needed for water-vapor densities other than the 
w0 = 7.75 g/m3 used in Figures 7.8–7.18. Because the relative contributions of 
oxygen and water vapor vary with frequency and altitude, exact attenuation curves 
for other water-vapor densities require that calculations using (7.22) be repeated 
for other moisture conditions. Blake’s solution to this problem is to plot separate 
families of curves for kO and for kW at 7.75 g/m3 at frequencies above L-band. 
The total attenuation k is then found by multiplying the plotted kW in decibels by 
the ratio w/7.75 g/m3 and adding it to kO for oxygen. 
An alternative to Blake’s method of adjusting for water-vapor content, which 
avoids the multistep procedure, is to scale readings from the curves of Figures 
7.8–7.18 directly by a water-vapor factor W, defined as

where k(0), kO(0), and kW(0) are the attenuations coefficients at sea level. Fig-

L(hm,w) = W(w) L(hm,7.75) is only approximate, because it fails to model the

ATTENUATION FROM PRECIPITATION 
7.3.1 
Rain Attenuation Coefficient at 293K 
Theoretical studies of rain attenuation are presented by Goldstein [11] and Gunn 
and East [12], whose results remain in extensive use. Much of that analysis and 
the today’s models of weather attenuation originated in a 1945 company report by 
Ryde and Ryde [13] and their subsequent paper published in 1946 by the Physical 
Society, London [14], neither of which is available today. More recent adjust-
ments are presented by Blake [1, pp. 214–221], and Nathanson [15, pp. 226–228]. 
The standard model that relates attenuation coefficient kr to rainfall rate 
takes the form [1, p. 215, Eq. (5.47)]:

where

Blake presents equations for a and b that apply for a temperature of 291K, and 
are updated here to match data in [1, p. 228, Table 6.4]:

where

xf  =  16.7log(0.13f0). 
The changes made here to Blake’s equations are that the last term in the denomi-
nator of (7.25) has an exponent 0.65 rather than 0.5, and the parameter xf is now 
16.7log(0.13f0) rather than 16.7log(0.1f0). The effect decreases a( f0) for f0 > 90 
GHz, and shifts the peak of the curve for b( f0) from 10 GHz to 7.75 GHz. The 
resulting two-way rain attenuation coefficient kr is shown as a function of fre-
quency in Figure 7.21, for different rainfall rates. 
Nathanson’s table gives slightly different values of a and b for horizontal and 
vertical polarization, consistent with observations that predict a gradual shift of 
circularly polarized waves to elliptical polarization. That is a critical issue in 

 
Atmospheric Effects

communications systems with polarization diplexing, but the average of each con-
stant over both polarizations is adequate for calculating radar attenuation in rain, 
giving accuracy better than can be justified by weather models. Medhurst [16] and 
Blake note that measured attenuation often exceeds that predicted by theory. 
Blake suggests that this may result from relative humidity approaching 300% dur-
ing rainstorms, an effect that can be modeled by increasing w in (7.23) and apply-
ing the resulting W to increase the attenuation of the atmospheric gases.  
7.3.2 
Temperature Dependence of Rain Attenuation 
Several studies [10–13, 17, 18] have shown that rain attenuation varies signifi-
cantly with the temperature of the water droplets. Ryde’s results, presented in [17, 
p. 19-12, Table 19-1] indicate that the attenuation coefficients for T = 291K, used 
in the model of the preceding section, should be multiplied by correction factors 
listed in Table 7.3. While these values differ significantly from some earlier re-
sults in [12, 13], especially for the longer wavelengths at low temperatures, they 
appear to represent an adequate model. The data in Table 7.3 can be approximated 
by the following approximation:

The results of (7.27) are plotted in Figure 7.22 as functions of wavelength in 
m and frequency in GHz. The abrupt transition to unity at 0.015m wavelength is 
unrealistic, but for shorter wavelengths the actual correction is less than 10% and 
does not require accurate modeling. 
The effects of higher and lower temperatures are compared in Figure 7.23 for 
high and low rainfall rates. It can be seen that only the microwave and lower radar 
bands are affected significantly by changing temperatures, but that the coefficient 
can increase or decrease by a factor of two at L-band and by 1.6 for S-band. Un-
certainties in the temperature profile over the extent of the rain region thus prevent 
accurate estimation of losses for X-band and lower frequencies, but the largest 
percentage errors occur where the attenuation is low, and the resulting errors in 
range calculation are moderate.

Rainfall Rate Statistics 
The probability of encountering a given rain attenuation depends of the type of 
climate in which the radar is operated. Figure 7.24 shows the percentage of time 
and corresponding hours per year in which rainfall exceeds a given rate for four 
climates. Taking the continental temperate climate as an example, a “moderate” 
rate of 3 mm/h can be expected about 1% of the time, or 90 hours per year. The 
probability of rain considered “heavy,” 16 mm/h, is about 0.2%, corresponding to 
18 hours per year. The need to include these levels of attenuation in a range calcu-

lation depends on the required reliability of the radar service. For example, signif-
icant range reduction for 18 hours per year might be unacceptable for an airport 
surveillance radar at a heavily used location, but acceptable for other radars. 
Much more detailed statistics on rain can be found in the book devoted to this 
subject by Crane [19], intended to describe rain attenuation problems on commu-
nications paths. Among the data he presents are the maximum altitudes of the rain 
cells corresponding to the rainfall rates observed with 0.001% and 1.0% probabil-
ity. At latitudes between 40 those altitudes are 4–5.5 km and 2.7–4.6 km, re-
spectively. Nathanson [15, p. 223] presents a plot of altitude as a function of rain-
fall rate, showing maximum altitude up to 9 km. He suggests that a model using 
uniform rate up to 4-km altitude is adequate in many cases. On the other hand, 
there have been measurements of rain reflectivity corresponding to rates exceed-
ing 250 mm/h in thunderheads, supported by updrafts at altitudes near 12 km, dur-
ing times when the surface received no rain. 
Nathanson notes that “design of air defense, air traffic control, or multimode 
airborne systems is quite different with anything near a 20-mm/h rainfall rate. It is 
also a question as to the enemy’s ability to operate in such an environment. Mili-

tary and civil air surveillance radars usually specify widespread 1- to 4-mm/h rain 
and sometimes a storm of perhaps 16 mm/h over a diameter of 10 to 20 km. Heav-
ier storms have smaller diameters.” He suggests an approximate relationship that 
in metric units converts to

(7.28) 
where d = storm diameter in km and rr = rainfall rate in mm/h. 
Data on the areas occupied by rainstorms are sparse. The higher rainfall rates 
are more limited in horizontal extent, with areas near 5 km2 for intense rain cells. 
Table 7.4 shows typical pathlengths and attenuations for large regions of light rain 
and small regions of intense rain. The pathlengths and attenuations apply to eleva-
tion angles such that the path remains below the maximum rain altitude as it pass-
es within the rain volume. For comparison, the atmospheric attenuation of the air 
is shown in the last row of the table. It can be seen that the presence of light rain 
has a small effect at X-band over the extent of the rain volume compared to that of 
the air, while heavy rain more than triples the attenuation in that small distance. 
That comparison would change for other bands. 
Rain clutter effects on detection range must be considered, of course, along 
with the attenuation discussed here (see Chapter 9). 
7.3.4 
Attenuation in Snow 
Water in frozen form has a much lower attenuation coefficient than rain. Blake 
presents an expression [1, p. 221, Eq. (5.53)] derived from Gunn and East [12, p. 
536] that gives the two-way attenuation, using  in m:

The effect of the temperature correction is to reduce the snow attenuation in the 
microwave band in regions where the temperature is significantly below 273K, as 
shown in Figure 7.25.

Attenuation in Clouds 
Goldstein’s derivation of cloud attenuation [11] remains definitive, confirmed by 
Gunn and East [12]. Both are based on work of Ryde [13, 14] and the classic Mie 
theory on scattering from spherical objects [20]. 
The attenuation of small, spherical water droplets is calculated from the com-
plex dielectric constant c of water, given as a function of wavelength by the De-
bye formula [21]:

This represents a 5% difference in the decibel value of cloud attenuation, which 
lies within the accuracy of temperature and water-content models for clouds. 
7.3.6 
Weather Effects on System Noise Temperature 
The sky temperature calculation of Section 6.3.2 considered only the attenuation 
in a clear atmosphere. Any increase in attenuation from precipitation or clouds 
carries with it an increase in system noise temperature. The total noise tempera-
ture is found by adding the one-way weather attenuation coefficient kw1( f0,h) 
from (7.24), (7.29), or (7.35) to that of the troposphere in the integral of (6.21):

where 
Lw = exp(0.2303kw1w) = loss (as a ratio) due to the weather;  
w = radial depth of the weather region in km.  
For example, a loss kw1w = 1 dB in particles at Tw = 290K contributes  60K to 
the noise temperature. Clear-air attenuation from shorter ranges reduces Tw, while 
the weather attenuation from ranges beyond the weather reduces the clear-air tem-
perature contribution, according to the second integral in (7.38). 
7.4 
TROPOSPHERIC LENS LOSS 
Rays leaving the radar antenna are refracted downward in the troposphere, as 
shown in Figure 7.28. A ray leaving the surface at elevation angle 0 arrives at the 
target point (R,ht) for which the true elevation angle is t. The time delay over this 
path exceeds that of a vacuum path by t = (Rd  R)/c, where Rd is given by the 

256 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
ray-tracing formula (7.8). The bending of the ray path is greatest for 0 = 0 and 
decreases monotonically as 0 increases. The result is that energy radiated from 
the surface within an angular extending from 0 to 0 + 0 is distributed over a 
slightly greater angular sector t to t + t at the target, reducing the energy densi-
ty relative to that that predicted for propagation in a vacuum. This effect is de-
scribed by Weil [22], who presents plots of the two-way loss as a function of tar-
get elevation angle and range. 
The loss can be computed in different ways, but a straightforward method is 
to express the one-way lens loss as the derivative of the ray’s final elevation angle 
t with respect to its value 0 as it leaves the antenna:

(7.40) 
where 0 is the launching angle from the antenna, 0 is a small increment in that 
angle, and t is the corresponding increment in the true elevation of the ray arri-
val angle at the target range. Since (7.8) cannot be inverted to evaluate the deriva-
tive represented by (7.40), t is obtained using a root-finding algorithm, allowing 
its derivative to be approximated over a small angular difference 0 in the launch 
angle of the ray from the surface. The results are in Figure 7.29 as the two-way 
lens loss Llens2 in decibels. The corresponding lens factor used in (1.25) is

angles near zero fail to show the continuing increase that reaches its maximum for 
R > 2,000 km. 
The curve for the minimum plotted beam elevation 0.03 in Figure 7.28 de-
parts at long ranges from a smooth curve because of difficulty in the algorithm for 
finding the derivative in (7.40) from ray-tracing expression (7.8) at  < 0.1. 
However, variations normally encountered in the refractive index profile lead to 
variations in lens loss in this region that mask these computational errors. 
The conclusion in [1] that reciprocity is applicable to the lens loss on the re-
turn path of the echo is correct, because the refractive process is linear and is 
equivalent to an increase in the antenna beamwidth, with corresponding loss as the 
rays pass through and beyond the troposphere and return to the radar along the 
same path.  
Lens loss does not result from dissipation of energy in the troposphere, and in 
contrast to other atmospheric losses it does not contribute to the system noise 
temperature. For this reason, it is included in the radar equation as a range-
dependent response factor Flens to keep it separate from the tropospheric absorp-
tion L. 
7.5 
IONOSPHERIC EFFECTS 
The ionosphere affects radar range performance in two ways: it introduces Fara-
day rotation of the wave polarization, causing the received polarization to differ 
from that transmitted, and it causes dispersion of different components of the sig-
nal spectrum, broadening the pulse and reducing its amplitude. Both these effects

are variable, depending on the path through the layers of the ionosphere and the 
electron density of these layers. Faraday rotation also depends on the strength and 
direction of the magnetic field with respect to the direction of the ray. 
7.5.1 
Geometry of Ray in Ionosphere 
The geometry of the ray path through an ionospheric layer is shown in Figure 
7.30. The ray leaves the Earth’s surface at elevation angle , enters the layer at 
altitude h1 and exits at h2. The maximum electron density of the layer occurs at 
altitude hm, where the ray elevation angle relative to the local horizontal is . The 
pathlength through the layer is R, given by

7.5.2 
Ionospheric Structure 
The daytime ionosphere consists of three layers, known as the E, F1, and F2 layers 
(a lower, weak D layer is of no importance in radar operation). At night, the E 
layer disappears and the F1 and F2 layers merge into a single F layer. The electron 
density Ne of the ionosphere was described in 1927 by Sydney Chapman, and his 
equations have been used by Millman [23] to derive the effects on radar transmis-
sions:

The electron densities vary upwards and downwards by factors up to about two, 
depending on solar condition and latitude, but the values shown in Figure 7.30 can 
be used to calculate typical effects on radar signals.  
7.5.3 
Total Electron Count 
The effects of the ionosphere on the radar signal are proportional to the total elec-
tron count Nt in a column having a cross section of one cm2 extending from the

where ae is the radius of the Earth in m. The function F is the cosecant of the local 
elevation angle of the beam at altitude h. It describes the ratio of the pathlength 
through each altitude element dh at local ray elevation  to the thickness of that 
element, allows integration with respect to altitude rather than range. Integration 
of (7.44) to an altitude of 106 m is sufficient to capture the effect of the iono-
sphere, since the electron density above that altitude is low enough to be neglect-
ed. 
The total electron count is shown as a function of target altitude in Figure 
7.32 for typical daytime and nighttime conditions. Signals from targets below 100 
km will experience negligible ionospheric effects, as will be shown when Faraday 
rotation and dispersion effects are calculated in the following sections.

For the daytime ionosphere at zero elevation, Figure 7.34 indicates that the 
rotation angle is less than 20 for f  3GHz. It is necessary at L-band (1.3 GHz) 
and below to allow for Faraday rotation in applying the radar equation to targets 
above about 250-km altitude. The loss may be eliminated by using circular polari-

zation, where rotation merely changes the phase of the received signal. If linear 
polarization is used for transmission, a dual-polarized receiving antenna may be 
used, the two linear polarizations being combined either adaptively, to follow the 
rotated signal polarization, or by noncoherently summing outputs of a two-
channel receiver, incurring a small integration loss.  
Because the Faraday rotation angle cannot be predicted accurately its effect 
on detection probability must be treated as a statistical quantity and the corre-

where 
Nt =  total electron count per m2 given by (7.44);

The delay is positive because the group velocity in the ionosphere is vg = nic. The 
delay in microseconds is shown in Figure 5.36 as a function of the ratio Nt/f0

where f is in Hz. 
For example, a signal at carrier frequency f0 = 100 MHz, echoed from a target 
beyond the typical daytime ionosphere at zero elevation with Nt = 1018/m2, returns 
to the radar with 28 s extra delay, corresponding to a range 4.2 km beyond the 
actual target. 
The extra range is not significant in using the radar equation, but in the pro-
cess of passing through the ionosphere the different frequencies in the pulse spec-
trum experience a differential delay. Letting f0 be the carrier frequency, and f the 
offset from that frequency of a spectral component of the waveform, we can ex-
press the differential delay t as:

t = differential time delay in s; 
f = frequency offset in Hz from carrier frequency f0. 
The first-order term for differential delay is thus proportional to the delay t of the 
carrier-frequency f0 multiplied by the frequency deviation as a fraction of the car-
rier. In the previous example of the pulse at f0 = 100 MHz, the delay at the carrier 
frequency was t = 28 s. For a waveform with spectral width B = 1 MHz, in this 
ionosphere, the extreme spectral components separated by 0.5 MHz from the 
carrier would have delays differing by

In the absence of the ionosphere (td) would be the output waveform of the

The effects of dispersion on the received waveform are shown in Figure 7.37, 
as calculated for carrier frequencies that give the indicated products of differential 
delay and bandwidth over a path with total electron count 3  1017 per m2. In Fig-
ure 7.38 the excess carrier time delay t has been removed to align the waveforms, 
to compare the effects on pulse shape and amplitude. The transmitted pulse as-
sumed for these plots is rectangular with width  = 0.1 s, such that the noise 
bandwidth of the transmission and the matched-filter is Bn = 10 MHz. As the car-
rier frequency is reduced toward 145 MHz from 10 GHz, where the ionospheric 
delay is negligible (t = 0), the delay increases to 4 s, the differential delay time 
increases to t = 0.5 s = 5/B, the pulse broadens to  0.5 s, and its amplitude 
decreases  to less than half its original voltage.

Since the filter response cannot be adjusted to compensate for phase shift 
over the signal bandwidth, there is a loss in signal amplitude, shown in Figure 
7.39. This loss is discussed by Brookner [25], who illustrates the broadening and 
loss on Gaussian pulses. His curves show, for example, that the “available band-
width” for propagation at low elevation angle through a severe daytime iono-
sphere is limited to about 1 MHz at f0 = 100 MHz, consistent with the curve for 
tBn = 0.5 in Figure 7.37 and the loss of 1.3 dB shown in Figure 7.38.

For pulse compression and other waveforms, the appropriate transmitted 
spectrum A( f) of the transmitted signal and its matched filter H( f ) may be entered 
into (7.55) to obtain the waveform of the received echo. The loss, when expressed 
as a function of the product tBn should follow a curve close to that of Figure 7.37.

SUMMARY OF ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS 
Tropospheric refraction is the cause of errors in measurement of target position, 
but the radar equation is not affected by those problems. It is affected, however, 
by the fact that the ray paths through the troposphere lie above the direct geomet-
ric line to the target, which reduces the density, and hence the attenuation, along 
the path. Hence, calculations of attenuation must be carried out with the appropri-
ate ray-tracing model for the troposphere. 
The attenuation coefficients of atmospheric gases can be found from theory 
developed during World War II by J. H. Van Vleck, and extended subsequently to 
cover the millimeter-wave region. Blake [1] gave the necessary equations and 
plotted the results. The same results are plotted here as a function of range in kil-
ometers. An alternative to his procedure for adjusting to moisture content is pre-
sented that holds accuracies within the limits set by uncertainties in atmospheric 
models. 
Precipitation and clouds add to attenuation of the clear air, and the model 
used by Blake is extended here to include temperature effects. The normal varia-
tions in temperature can change the attenuation coefficient of rain, expressed in 
dB/km, over the 3:1 range represented by factors between 1.8 and 0.6 relative to 
the values at 291K that are often cited. The literature on this effect is far from uni-
fied, but an approximate model is developed here to estimate this correction.  
To describe radar performance when weather is present, the effect of its at-
tenuation on the sky temperature is expressed here by an addition to the integral 
presented in Chapter 6 that gives the conventional clear-air sky temperature. This 
correction becomes increasingly important as receiver noise temperatures are re-
duced to near or below the temperature of the clear sky. 
The effect of the ionosphere on the radar equation is important for radars op-
erating below S-band on targets in or beyond the F layer. Faraday rotation of the 
echo signal polarization causes a loss when other than circular polarization is 
used. There is also a dispersion limit on signal bandwidth that can be supported by 
transmission paths through the ionosphere, and the echo signal power is reduced 
steeply as the bandwidth exceeds the reciprocal of the differential delay across the 
spectrum. 

270 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Ionospheric effects are especially important in VHF and UHF radars when 
they are used for detection and tracking of ballistic missiles, but must be consid-
ered in those applications even for L-band radars.

CHAPTER 8 
The Pattern-Propagation Factor 
Chapter 1 derived the radar equation for free-space detection range, and noted the 
importance of including the pattern-propagation factors Ft and Fr that describe the 
effects of the transmitting and receiving antenna patterns in elevation and interac-
tion with the Earth’s surface. This chapter considers those factors in detail, includ-
ing both reflections from the surface and diffraction on paths that graze the sur-
face. For brevity, we will use the term F-factor. 
The original radar equation [1, Eq. (31)] included the F-factor, which had 
been developed during World War II and defined in [2, p. 35] as 
the ratio of the amplitude of the electric field at a given point under specified conditions to the 
amplitude of the electric field under free-space conditions with the beam of the transmitter di-
rected toward the point in question. 
Radar equations for modern radar must include this factor unless the radar beam is 
elevated well above the surface and has negligible sidelobes that illuminate the 
surface. There are four regions in which the F-factor varies differently with range: 
 Near region, where a clear path exists and F  1; 
 Interference region, where surface reflections interfere with the direct ray; 
 Intermediate region, where both interference and diffraction are applicable; 
 Diffraction region, where diffraction is dominant. 
Blake [3, Chapter 6] described multipath (surface-reflection) effects on prop-
agation, and extended the discussion to a simple model of smooth-sphere diffrac-
tion. We will follow Blake’s methods, which present several levels of complexity 
and accuracy of modeling the F-factor, discuss the errors that result from simplifi-
cations and imperfect knowledge of the several parameters involved, and extend 
the discussion to knife-edge diffraction, which may modify the results obtained 
from the smooth-sphere model.

The calculation requires knowledge of the antenna elevation patterns for transmit-
ting and receiving, the pathlength difference , and the complex surface reflection 
coefficient . Those parameters are discussed in subsequent sections of this chap-
ter. Most conventional radars use a common antenna for which a single calcula-
tion of F is sufficient. In phased array radars, the transmitting and receiving pat-
terns often differ even when the are generated by a common array, requiring sepa-
rate calculations for Fit and Fir.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
8.1.2 
Application of the F-Factor 
The F-factor is applied in the Blake chart (Figure 1.1 or 1.2) as an adjustment to 
the free-space range R0 to obtain R = R0Fi. This is followed by application of a 
factor for atmospheric attenuation based on the range R. The iterative process in 
steps 9–13 of the chart leads to an accurate result for any specified target elevation 
angle. A range-height-angle (coverage) plot may then be prepared by scaling 
range to the F-factor, with adjustments as needed for variation of attenuation with 
elevation angle and range. 
At elevation angles t << 1,   2hrsint, and for a horizontally polarized ra-
dar the reflection coefficient (see Section 8.3) is   1.00, leading to

where i = 1 corresponds to the null at the horizon and to the first reflection lobe. 
As an example, consider a horizontally polarized S-band radar with elevation 
beamwidth e = 6, operating at height hr = 10m over a sea surface. The axis of 
the elevation beam is normally set to b  e/3 above the horizon. The lower lobes 
of the F-factor, shown in Figure 8.1, are approximately sinusoidal, as predicted by 
(8.11). When applied to the radar equation this results in a range at the center of 

 
The Pattern-Propagation Factor 
277 
the lowest lobe that is approximately twice the free-space range for that elevation 
angle. For zero axis tilt, f () = 1 at the horizon, and the first lobe would have am-
plitude Fi = 2.0, rather than the somewhat lower value shown in the figure. If the 
elevation angle scale is converted to target altitude at a given range, the plot will 
show the height-gain factor for the radar-target path.  
Computer methods of solving for detection range are based on calculating the 
received and required signal energies as functions of range and identifying the 
longest range at which the requirement is met. Range-dependent parameters in the 
radar equation, including atmospheric attenuation and F-factor, are determined for 
each range, based on the assumed target trajectory. If that trajectory maintains a 
constant elevation from the radar, repeated calculations of the F-factor may be 
unnecessary as long as the resulting detection range remains large enough to give 
a constant pathlength difference  (see Section 8.2).

GEOMETRICAL MODELS OF THE RAY PATHS

cient is to be calculated. Depending on the target ranges of interest and the accu-
racy required of the calculation, there are several modeling methods that may be 
used, starting with a distant target over a flat Earth, proceeding to targets at arbi-
trary range, and then to spherical-Earth models of increasing complexity. 
8.2.1 
Method 1: Flat-Earth Approximation with Distant Target 
The geometry is shown in Figure 8.2. For this simple model, the input parameters 
are the radar wavelength , antenna height hr above the surface, and target eleva-
tion t.  
The reflected ray, arriving at the radar site parallel to the direct ray, can be 
considered as passing in a straight line through the surface at the point of specular 
reflection to an image antenna located hr below the surface. The grazing angle  
of that ray relative to the surface is equal to the elevation t and the pathlength 
difference is

The Pattern-Propagation Factor

The following parameters will be assumed in comparing this approximation 
with others and with exact methods to be described in subsequent sections: 
 
 
hr = 10m,  = 0.1m, and t = 2.  
This is the case used as an example in Figure 8.1. At 2 elevation, the phase rever-
sal introduced by the reflection coefficient shifts the reflected ray by  radians, 
relative to the direct ray, causing a deep null to appear near that elevation. 
8.2.2 
Method 2: Flat-Earth Approximation with Target at Arbitrary 
Range 
Relaxing the assumption that the target is at range long enough that the rays can 
be considered parallel on arrival at the radar site, the geometry is as shown in Fig-
ure 8.3. The target is at range R and elevation t, and in rectangular coordinates it 
is characterized by altitude ht1 and ground range G:

where 1 is the result of the distant-target approximation (8.16). The reduction in 
the pathlength difference by inclusion of the second-order term in (8.21) is about 
one part in 105 at 2 elevation, but can be significant at higher elevation angles. 
The F-factor plot for this case is indistinguishable from Figure 8.1.

Method 3: First-Order Approximation for Spherical Earth  
A simple, first-order correction for the spherical Earth with effective radius keae 
uses the target altitude ht1 above a plane tangent to the Earth’s surface at the radar 
site, as shown in Figure 8.4.  
The surface at the target range lies below the tangent plane by

where keae is the effective Earth’s radius. Here and subsequently, the constant ke  
4/3 appears along with the actual radius ae, making the results dependent on the 
tropospheric refractivity gradient (see Section 7.1.4). As the target altitude in-
creases, this method of modeling the effects of tropospheric refraction becomes 
less accurate, resulting in errors in the geometric models discussed. However, the 
results may still be used to compare the relative accuracies of different methods, 
keeping in mind that the error in refractive modeling may exceed that of geomet-
ric approximations. Blake developed a method of using the exponential reference 
atmosphere to relate R, ht, and t, but found it unnecessary to apply this to calcula-
tion of the F-factor, basing it instead on the effective radius keae.

Comparison of Approximate Methods 
The results of the six methods are compared in Table 8.1, where all values are 
calculated for an elevation angle t = 2. Two antenna altitudes and two ranges are 
considered. The variation among results is negligible for the low-sited radar (hr = 
10m), except that the Fishback solution for the spherical Earth gives a lower ele-
vation when the same target altitude is used as in the more approximate methods. 
Over typical land surfaces, there is likely to be some variation in the surface 
which, along with uncertainty in the refractivity profile, will mask any difference 
in the geometrical model. 
At the higher antenna altitude (hr = 100m), Method 1 fails to capture the di-
vergence of grazing angle from target elevation, which is  0.1 in these exam-
ples. It also underestimates the pathlength difference, as does the distant-target 
approximation. 
The Fishback method and Blake’s modification are not excessively burden-
some for today’s computers, and may be included in programs for solution of the 
radar equation. For surface-based radars at other than high altitudes, any of the 
approximate methods may be used without introducing large errors in the grazing 
angle and pathlength difference.

REFLECTION COEFFICIENT 
Having determined the angles required to express f (t) and f (r) of (8.9), the 
pathlength difference that determines  in that equation, and the grazing angle  
at the surface, the next step is to calculate the magnitude  and phase  of the sur-
face reflection coefficient. The magnitude is the product of three terms:

These expressions give the values for salt water shown as a function of frequency 
in Figure 8.7. 
The resulting reflection coefficients are plotted in Figures 8.8. and 8.9, for 
different surfaces at X-band and at VHF as listed in Table 8.2, where data for 
fresh water and land surfaces have been added. Data on land surfaces were taken 
from [5]. The curves for salt water in the microwave band follow those for fresh 
water, but diverge as wavelengths increase.  
Coefficients for snow and ice, not plotted, are essentially the same as for poor 
soil.

That approximation breaks down for salt water at long wavelengths, but gives 
a good estimate for the other cases illustrated. For horizontal polarization the 
magnitude 0h remains near unity for grazing angles below about 10, and the 
phase angle remains near 180 at all grazing angles. It is for this case that the ap-
proximation (8.11) for the F-factor applies. 
The reflection coefficient for circular polarization is discussed by Blake [3, p. 
264]. Defining the reflection coefficient for the same sense of circular polarization 
as the direct ray as cs, this is given by

Reflection from Rough Surfaces 
The magnitude of the surface reflection coefficient is equal to the Fresnel coeffi-
cient for smooth surfaces, but for rough surfaces is reduced by a specular scatter-
ing coefficient [6, p. 316]:

where h is the rms height deviation of the surface relative to its mean. The value 
of h to be used is that within the first Fresnel zone that surrounds the point of 
specular reflection at ground range G1 from the antenna (see Figure 8.5). That 
zone is defined as the elliptical surface area from which the delay of the reflected 
ray deviates by < /2 from that at the specular point [2, pp. 412–418]. 
The Rayleigh roughness criterion is commonly used to describe the height hs 
of surface irregularities below which the surface can be considered “smooth”:

The fraction of power in the specular reflection is s
2 = 0.54 when the Rayleigh 
criterion is met, using the 2 value for hs. Other scaling of h to h gives slightly 
different results, but that used here gives a reasonable physical interpretation, and 
(8.57), based on a Gaussian distribution of height deviations, is commonly used. 
The grazing angle  is found from the geometrical models of Section 8.2. 
Blake comments on the departure of some experimental data on s in [7] from 
the value given by (8.57), at larger values of the normalized roughness 
x = (h/)sin, where s  0. There are several possible explanations of this, but 
in the development of the theory of multipath tracking errors [8] it was found that 
the experiment described in [7], conducted on a path between oil platforms in the 
Gulf of Mexico, was limited to a constant, small value of grazing angle , and 
achieved high values of (h/)sin only as a result of large wave heights. This 
introduced shadowing of the wave troughs, which in turn reduced the h of the 
visible reflecting surfaces [8, p. 516, Eq. (11.2.6)]:

where 0 is 1.4 times the rms slope of the wave surfaces. The experimental data 
match (8.57) more closely when the corrected value h is used for high sea states.

 
The plot of the specular and diffuse scattering coefficients as a function of the 
normalized roughness (h/)sin is shown in Figure 8.10. 
Experimental values of d reported in [7] did not exceed 0.4. This was partly 
the result of failure to correct for shadowing at high sea states, but also because 
most of the diffuse energy between low-altitude terminals tends to be reflected 
from surface areas near the two ends of a path. In the experiment, almost half the 

294 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
total diffuse energy arrived at negative elevation angles on the lower skirts or be-
low the mainlobe of the antenna, reducing the measured d. That situation applies 
also in many radar applications, limiting the diffuse energy actually received by 
the antenna. Procedures outlined in [8, pp. pp. 519–520] give the elevation density 
d of diffuse energy and the fraction of (0d)2 that is received by the antenna 
power gain pattern. 
As noted by Blake [3, p. 268], the diffuse reflections introduce or increase 
random fluctuations in the target echo, adding to the direct power while reducing 
the strength of the lobing caused by the specular component.  
When the diffuse reflection are strong, the expression for the F-factor may be 
modified to include that term:

be significantly affected only if their probability density function is narrowed to 
within the width of the Rician distribution by averaging over the observation time. 
No studies of this effect have been identified. 
8.3.3 
Land Surfaces with Vegetation 
For land- or air-based radar, the effect of vegetation must be included in calculat-
ing the surface-reflected energy. Experimental data reported in [10], along with a 
survey of related literature, permitted generation of an empirical model [11, p. 287 
and Appendix 6B]. The absorption is modeled as a vegetation factor v that multi-
plies 0 in calculating the reflection coefficient for both specular and diffuse re-
flection:

where the coefficients a and b are

a = 0.32,  
b = 3  for brush or dense weeds; 
 
a = 0.032, 
b = 5  for dense trees. 
The results for X-band ( = 0.03m), S-band ( = 0.1m), and VHF ( = 1m) 
are shown in Figure 8.11. The reduction in reflection coefficient increases with 
frequency and depth of vegetation, and is minimal in the VHF band unless dense 
trees cover the otherwise visible surface. Even a thin layer of grass introduces up 
to 10 dB reduction at X-band, at grazing angles greater than a few degrees. The 
model is necessarily approximate, given the wide variation in foliage density and 
water content. However, the author has personally observed that two-foot layer of 
weeds in the first Fresnel zone virtually eliminates reflection lobing on an L-band 
air surveillance radar, and that sparse grass drops the X-band reflection coefficient 
by  10 dB. 
8.3.4 
The Divergence Factor 
Another factor affecting the reflected rays is the divergence factor D [2, p. 99; 3, 
p. 270], expressed approximately by [3, p. 270, Eq.(6.79)]:

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
This factor results from the Earth’s curvature within the first Fresnel zone sur-
rounding the point of specular reflection, and appears as a multiplier to the reflec-
tion coefficient  in equations for the Fi. 
The factor is near unity and can be ignored for most surface-based radars, be-
cause the geometric conditions leading to D < 1 correspond to values of 
pathlength difference  that are in the intermediate region, where interpolation 
between the interference and diffraction factors masks the effects of D (see Sec-
tion 8.6.1). However, for sites or airborne radars elevated to hr > 100m above the 
reflecting surface it can reduce reflections. 
8.4 
DIFFRACTION 
8.4.1 
Smooth-Sphere Diffraction 
Diffraction over the spherical Earth affects the F-factor when the pathlength dif-
ference  from Section 8.2 is less than about /6, and becomes dominant at and 
below the horizon. The expression for the diffraction factor, assuming full antenna 
gain toward the horizon and using only the first mode of the diffraction equation, 
is [2, p. 122]:

A typical plot of the Fd0 is shown in Figure 8.12. Dashed vertical lines bound 
the intermediate region that extends between R, the limit of the interference re-
gion, and Rh, the 4/3-Earth horizon range beyond which the single-mode diffrac-
tion values are adequate. Those ranges are 128 km and 143 km, respectively, in 
this example. For interpolation between the diffraction and reflection results in the 
intermediate region, it has been found useful to place a limit Fd0  1, as shown by 
the dashed line in the figure, using

Methods have been developed using higher-order modes that yield accurate

the Smooth-Earth and Knife-Edge (SEKE) program [12], which includes multiple 
smooth-sphere diffraction modes, along with reflection and knife-edge diffraction, 
to calculate the F-factor for arbitrary terrain profiles. A version of SEKE that runs 
on personal computers was created, but it is not widely available.

Knife-Edge Diffraction 
Land-based radars often operate at sites where the horizon is established by a dis-
crete obstacle, as shown in Figure 8.13. The object need not have a sharp contour, 
because for radar wavelengths almost any surface feature diffracts as a knife-edge 
at low grazing angle. Trees, buildings, and even low ridges and raised ledges can 
establish a horizon at a masking angle above the surface of the smooth sphere. 
The propagation factor at this horizon is Fdk = 0.5, giving Fdk
4 = 12 dB for two-
way propagation. Below the mask angle, Fdk drops to zero more slowly than for 
the smooth sphere, enabling some radars to detect targets in the shadow region. 
This capability is most pronounced for the longer radar wavelengths and for ob-
stacles projecting well above the surface, but it has been exploited even at micro-
waves in communications systems using the obstacle gain of a mountain or ridge.  
The propagation factor for knife-edge diffraction depends on the vertical dis-
tance h between the top of the obstacle and the direct path between the radar and 
the target (Figure 8.14). A diffraction parameter v is defined as

Obstacle gain occurs when this factor is greater than the corresponding value 
for smooth-sphere diffraction in the absence of the obstacle. However, it is im-
portant to establish that the top of the obstacle is in a free-space field. For exam-
ple, Figure 8.15 shows a typical diffraction situation with an isolated obstacle. In 
this case, the extra path length for reflections from the terrain between the radar 
and the obstacle is 0 = 0.6m, and knife-edge diffraction should be used describe 
the fields beyond the obstacle when  < 60. For longer wavelengths or lower an-
tenna or obstacle heights, the top of the obstacle would not be fully illuminated,

The obstacle need not be visibly sharp to qualify as a “knife edge” for diffrac-
tion purposes. Analysis of diffraction over cylinders of different radii shows that 
the diffraction field is essentially at its knife-edge value when the radius of curva-
ture r of the obstacle meets the criterion

can be as great as 4.9 km (for X-band) or 1.8 km (for L-band) without significant-
ly reducing the fields produced at a target masked by the obstacle.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
The pattern-propagation factor Fd for knife-edge diffraction is FiFfk, where Fi 
is the interference factor that establishes the field at the top of the obstacle. The 
interference factor is discussed in the following section, but the criterion for full 
illumination of the knife edge can be expressed as an obstacle with height above 
the average surface exceeding

d


(8.75) 
For X-band radar this corresponds to a height hmin = 17m at d1 = 10 km, which is a 
reasonable minimum value for a path near the horizon. 
8.5 
THE INTERFERENCE REGION 
In the interference region there is an unobstructed line of sight between the radar 
and the target, with enough clearance above the surface that diffraction effects are 
negligible. This clearance corresponds to a pathlength difference  between the 
direct and reflected rays that exceeds /6. The interference F-factor, including the 
divergence factor, is given by (8.9), and substitution of the more complicated ex-
pression (8.60) for strong diffuse reflections is seldom necessary. 
A plot of Fi as a function of range for a typical case is shown in Figure 8.16, 
where the target is flying at an altitude ht = 1 km over a bare land surface with 
roughness h = 1m, and a broad elevation beam is assumed. Two dashed vertical 
lines identify the intermediate region that extends from R = 128 km to Rh = 143.5 
km. The sharp increase near Rh results from applying the divergence factor, but as

will be shown in Section 8.6.1 this will not affect the end result. The decay of the 
lobing structure for short ranges results from the reduction in the specular scatter-
ing coefficient as grazing angle increases. For smooth surfaces without vegetation, 
these lobes would continue to peak at +6 dB until reduced by the shaped antenna 
pattern. Rougher surfaces tend to limit the reflection effects to the initial lobe 
shown here at  115 km. 
8.6 
THE INTERMEDIATE REGION 
Unless a multiple-mode diffraction model is used, the F-factor for the intermedi-
ate region must be estimated by interpolation between the interference and diffrac-
tion values. Fishback in [2, pp. 125–129] states that 
To determine the field strength in this region, it is necessary to prepare a plot of field strength 
as a function of distance for given terminal heights, extending the plot from the region in 
which interference-region methods are valid through the intermediate region into the region of 
validity for diffraction methods by bold interpolation. 
To define the region, it is necessary first to solve for the range R at which the 
pathlength difference between the direct and reflected paths reaches /6. At that 
point, the direct and reflected fields are 120 out of phase, and the interference F-
factor is approximately unity. An accurate spherical-Earth model must generally 
be used for calculation R, requiring either graphical or root-finding methods, 
based on (8.42)(8.46). The solution for the horizon range Rh is more straightfor-
ward:

F-Factor as a Function of Target Range 
One method for interpolation is to calculate the interference and diffraction factors 
FidB(R) = 20logFi(R) and FddB(Rh) = 20logFd(Rh) in decibels, and connect them 
with a straight line. This is done by applying a weight x to the diffraction factor 
and 1  x to the interference factor in the intermediate region:

The interference factor Fi(R) is calculated by substituting in (8.9) the target eleva-
tion angle t as a function of R from (8.47). An example for the same target trajec-
tory as in Figures 8.14 and 8.18 is shown in Figure 8.17. Note that the effect of the 
divergence factor has been eliminated by the interpolation process, which gives 
heavy weight to Fd as range approaches Rh. 
This interpolation method is somewhat less satisfactory when used with a 
VHF radar, as shown in Figure 8.18. The F-factor of the interpolated curve is 
probably below that which would be obtained from a more accurate multimode 
diffraction model without interpolation. However, the curve does capture the es-
sential difference between microwave and VHF propagation, showing an extended 
intermediate region with F going below unity at much shorter range (higher eleva-
tion), but falling more slowly as range increases into the diffraction region.

then be adjusted for atmospheric attenuation that varies with R and t as shown in 
Chapter 7, using the one- or two-step iterative method of the Blake chart. 
8.6.3.2 Accurate Method of Creating Coverage Plot 
A more accurate coverage chart is produced using (1.26), which includes not only 
the F-factor and atmospheric attenuation for each elevation angle but also range 
variation in the detectability factor Dx and in the factor Frdr that contains the lens 
factor, along with sensitivity time control, eclipsing, and other factors. 
The procedure for computer generation of the accurate coverage chart, once 
radar and environmental parameters have been specified in sufficient detail, is as 
follows: 
 A maximum range of calculation Rcmax is established that exceeds the detec-
tion range of the peak lobe in the coverage; 
 A set of ranges Rci is established that that covers 0–Rcmax at intervals R that 
produce smooth plotted curves:

This format, in which slant range is the ordinate and altitude above the tangent 
plane is the abscissa, is more convenient for plotting than that used by Blake, in 
which the ordinate is ground range and lines of constant slant range curve inwards 
at high altitude. The latter format, described in [14], preserves the shape of the 
coverage contour when the plotted coverage extends to altitudes comparable to the 
slant range.

SUMMARY OF PATTERN-PROPAGATION FACTOR 
The interference factor Fi expresses the magnitude of the vector sum of the direct 
ray and a ray reflected from the Earth’s surface, and is applicable to targets to 
which the path has adequate clearance above the surface. In the interference re-
gion, where adequate clearance exists, the pathlength difference  between the 
direct and reflected rays is greater than /6. 
The smooth-sphere diffraction factor Fd0 expresses the magnitude of the field 
on the path to a target that lies below the horizon, and is applicable to targets be-
yond the horizon range given, for a path that does not encounter an obstacle that 
rises significantly above the surface, by

In the diffraction region, field is greater than zero but drops rapidly below that of 
the free-space path to the horizon range.  
The knife-edge diffraction factor Fdk expressed the magnitude of the field be-
yond an obstacle that extends above the smooth spherical surface enough to form 
a horizon at range less than Rh. The criteria for such an obstacle are a radius of 
curvature less than that given by (8.74) and a height greater than that given by 
(8.75). The field beyond the obstacle exceeds that given by smooth-sphere diffrac-
tion at the same range. 
In the intermediate region, where a line-of-sight direct path exists but has in-
adequate clearance from the surface, the field can be approximated by interpola-
tion between the diffraction and interference fields. 
A plot of the F-factor as a function of range, for a given target trajectory (e.g., 
constant altitude), exposes the nature of propagation condition as the target moves 
through the three regions: interference, intermediate, and diffraction. If the free-
space factor R4 is combined with the F-factor, the plot serves as the basis for 
graphical solution of the range equation, as was shown in Figures 1.3–1.5. A plot 
of the F-factor as a function of target altitude for a given range, as shown in Fig-

ure 8.21, provides a means of exploring details of the low-altitude propagation 
effects. 
The most useful method of presenting surveillance radar coverage is the 
range-height-angle plot shown in Figure 8.22. Data for such plots can be assem-
bled with relatively simple calculations based on the Blake chart, but today are 
more easily obtained by computer programs such as [13] or [14].

CHAPTER 9 
Clutter and Signal Processing 
Chapter 3 presented radar equations for the maximum detection range when clut-
ter and jamming add to the interference created by thermal noise. In those equa-
tions, the effective spectral density of interference I0e used in the equations is the 
sum of the densities of thermal noise, clutter, and jamming. In this context, effec-
tive refers to the density of white Gaussian interference that would have the same 
effect on detection probability as does the actual interference component, for 
which the spectral density may be uneven and the amplitude probability density 
function may be broader than the normal distribution. 
This chapter presents models of surface, volume, and discrete clutter for use 
in determining their energy levels at the receiver input and the extent of their sta-
tistical departures from white, Gaussian noise, as functions of range from the ra-
dar. The models are general in nature. References are provided to literature dis-
cussing in greater detail the peculiarities of different types of clutter, from which 
more refined models can be constructed as necessary and as justified by 
knowledge of a particular environment. 
Most radars incorporate some type of special signal processing designed to 
minimize the clutter at the output to display or detection circuits. The effect of 
such circuits is included in the radar equations of Chapter 3 through the clutter 
improvement factor Im, for which calculation methods are discussed here in Sec-
tion 9.6.

MODELS OF SURFACE CLUTTER 
9.1.1 
Clutter Cross Section and Reflectivity 
The geometry of surface clutter as observed by the mainlobe of a radar sited on or 
above the surface is discussed in Section 3.3. The radar cross section is given by

intrinsic surface clutter reflectivity 0:

(9.1) 
where the area Ac is given by (3.18). 
The reflectivity is best modeled as the product of a intrinsic clutter reflectivity 
 and the sine of the local grazing angle  with which the radar ray reaches the 
surface:

sin

 
(9.2) 
This constant- model is generally applicable when combined with a clutter prop-
agation factor discussed in Section 9.1.2, and when  is not near 90. The reflec-
tivity described by (9.1) and (9.2) results from interaction of the radar ray with 
small-scale surface features that scatter a small fraction of the incident wave back 
to the source. To describe the persistence of clutter as   0, a small constant 
value in the order of 106 is sometimes added to (9.2), or an increment 0.0001 rad 
is added to the grazing angle , as in [1, p. 405]. The equations are inapplicable to 
scattering from surfaces that support specular reflection back toward the radar, 
such as discrete clutter from some manmade objects, as discussed in Section 3.5, 
or surface clutter viewed near vertical incidence.  
Sea and land surfaces also produce a specular reflection component when 
viewed near vertical incidence, where a facet component 0
f must be added to 0 
to account for quasi-specular reflection from surface facets [2, p. 108, Eq. (3.32)]:

  =  (/2)   = slope of facet giving specular reflection; 
0  =  2  times the rms slope of the surface 
The facet angle  that gives specular reflection is equal to the angle from vertical 
at which the facet is observed. Values of 0 for typical sea and land surfaces are in 
the order of 0.05 rad, so for the sea and bare land surfaces for which 0v  1 the 
facet component has a sharp peak of magnitude  1/0

centered at  = /2 = 90. This will be illustrated in graphs of reflectivity for sea 
and land surfaces in Sections 9.2.2 and 9.3.1. 
Most measured data do not show the large peak value predicted by (9.3), be-
cause the beamwidth of the measuring antenna observes the surface over an angle 
sector approaching or exceeded 0, averaging the measured 0 over angles beyond 
the narrow quasi-specular lobe. Convolution of the measuring beamwidth 3 with 
the facet slope deviation leads to the expression for the product of measured re-
flectivity and the pattern-propagation factor Fc
4 (discussed further in the next sec-
tion, but in this case representing the results of integration over the antenna pat-
tern) [2, p. 109, Eq. (3.23)]:

9.1.2 
Surface Clutter Pattern-Propagation Factor 
When the path between radar and clutter departs from free-space conditions, radar 
equations for clutter, such as (3.4), require the inclusion of the clutter pattern-
propagation factor Fc and the atmospheric attenuation Lc on the two-way path.1 
The departures from free-space propagation that enter Fc include interference be-
tween the direct ray and rays reflected in the forward direction from the surface 
beneath the path, and diffraction on paths near the surface. For simplicity, it is 
normally assumed that the antenna pattern terms in (8.9) and (8.10) for direct and 
reflected rays the interference region are equal. This permits the following discus-
sions to treat a clutter propagation factor that will be denoted by Fc, separating 
the antenna pattern factor f (rb) in the direction of the surface as a term to be 
applied for a specific radar and its beam elevation angle.  
Measurements of surface clutter reflectivity are actually measurements of the 
product cFc
4. Hence the values of Fc
4 applicable to the measurement geometry 
and antenna must be known if 0 is to be modeled for use with other radars and 
paths. In order to interpret the measured data on which the models Sections 
9.29.4 are based, it will be assumed that antenna pattern effects were taken into 
account in calculating the reported reflectivity, and that the quantity reported as 0 
is actually the product cFc
4, except in rare instances where Fc is specifically ad-
dressed as a separate factor. 
                                                           
1  Blake in [2, p. 27, Eq. (1.44)] notes that “the factor Fc
4 has been omitted because by convention it is 
included in the evaluation of 0.” It is considered here as a separate factor. 

314 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Five regions for surface clutter measurement and modeling may be identified, 
based on the range from the radar. In order of increasing range, these are: 
 
Zenith region (from airborne radar), where (9.3) or (9.4) applies; 
 
Near region2, R < R1, where a clear path exists and Fc  1; 
 
Interference region, R1 < R < R, where reflections interfere with the direct 
ray; 
 
Intermediate region, R < R < Rh, where both interference and diffraction are 
applicable; 
 
Diffraction region, Rh < R, where diffraction is dominant. 
Figure 9.1 shows the geometry of a surface-based radar viewing clutter from the 
last four of these regions (the first being applicable only to airborne radars). 
The transition between near and interference regions takes place at range R1,

proportional to the grazing angle.

grazing angle. The full expression for the clutter propagation factor in these two

where hc  3h is the height of significant clutter scatterers above the average sur-
face. For the conditions illustrated in Figure 9.2, R = 8.9 km at X-band and 1.8 
km at L-band. The curves for Fc will begin to deviate from the interference value 
beyond those ranges, as will be shown below. 
Both smooth-sphere and knife-edge diffraction must be considered for ranges 
beyond R. The diffraction equations (8.63)(8.75) are applied, substituting hc for 
ht, unless the horizon is established by an obstacle rising above the average sur-
face by at least hmin, as given by (8.75). A random rough surface may also meet 
the knife-edge criterion if the rms roughness is large enough:

For the conditions illustrated in Figure 9.2 this would require h > 13m for X-

stituting hc for ht. 
Figure 9.3 shows the effect of transition to smooth-sphere diffraction beyond 
R for the conditions used in Figure 9.2. The diffraction term causes a slight in-
crease in the propagation factor in the intermediate region, followed by a steeper 
decrease near and beyond the horizon. The two-segment approximation (9.11) and 
the full expression (9.10) for the near and interference regions are generally ade-
quate within the horizon range but give overestimates beyond the horizon. 
There are situations in which surface clutter from antenna sidelobes causes in-
terference that is not expressed by (9.1) using the area Ac from (3.18). The area

where ftsf and frsf are the rms voltage gains of transmitting and receiving sidelobes 
in the forward hemisphere, and Gtsf, iso and Gtsf, iso are the corresponding forward-
hemisphere power gains relative to an isotropic antenna. For the rear hemisphere, 
(9.15) is used with backlobe levels replacing forward sidelobe levels. 
The clutter contributions from sidelobes are generally much smaller than 
those of the mainlobe, but become important when one or more of the following 
conditions is encountered: 
 
The mainlobe, for the range considered, does not illuminate the surface; 
 
The mainlobe clutter has a Doppler shift that allows it to be reduced by a 
larger improvement factor than can be obtained at the Doppler shift of 
sidelobe clutter; 
 
The two-way sidelobe gain ratio represented by the factors multiplying Fc
4 
in (9.15) exceeds  0.1a/. 
 
The sidelobes reach the surface at ranges less than does the mainlobe. 
The second and last of these conditions are often encountered in airborne radar 
operating at medium or high PRF [2, pp. 245–248], extending clutter broadly 
across the blind-speed intervals vb = ifr/2, where i is an integer.  
9.1.3 
Spectral Properties of Surface Clutter 
The shape of the clutter spectrum affects the radar equation in two ways: 
 
The improvement factor Im, which expresses the reduction in clutter energy 
as it passes through the signal processor, is critically dependent on the shape 
of the clutter input spectrum; 
 
The clutter detectability factor (see Section 3.2.3), which adjusts the radar 
equation for correlation of clutter samples at the output of the signal proces-
sor, is sensitive to the product of input spectral density and processor re-
sponse function. 
Measurements of the clutter spectrum of sea clutter are reported in [4, p. 579] 
as “roughly Gaussian in shape.” Similar measurements on land clutter from wood-
ed sites showed a deviation from Gaussian shape, but including also a steady 
component represented by an impulse function at zero velocity.  
A Gaussian spectrum was assumed as the basis for calculating clutter effects 
in the early paper by Barlow [5] on CW radar:

where vc is the standard deviation in clutter velocity in m/s and C is the clutter

platform, or wind effect on a sea surface. Values of the half-power spectral widths 
reported in [4] and subsequent works are discussed in the following sections for 
different types of clutter. 
Use of the Gaussian form for the intrinsic clutter spectrum is convenient, be-
cause it is easily combined with components of spread caused by radar parame-
ters. These several components are: 
 The antenna scan modulation component. A scanning radar beam modulates 
the echo with the one-way voltage pattern function given by (5.3), which 
becomes a two-way power function of time t:

The total spectrum of the clutter is the sum of a narrow Gaussian components con-
taining the DC power with rms spread v0 and a wider Gaussian components con-
taining the AC power with spread v.  
As discussed in Section 9.3, recent results for land clutter have shown spectra 
with an exponential, rather than Gaussian shape. The simple expression (9.17) 
must then be replaced by a spectrum representing the convolution of the exponen-
tial intrinsic spectrum with a Gaussian function of unit power given by (9.22), for 
which there is no convenient closed-form expression. The resulting spectrum falls 
off more slowly than would a Gaussian spectrum having the same half-power 
width, leading to degraded improvement factor in a Doppler-based processor. 
When sidelobe or backlobe clutter is encountered at significant levels, it spec-
trum has a beamwidth component that extends over velocities between v0 and v0, 
at levels determined by the envelopes of the corresponding lobe structure.

Amplitude Distributions of Surface Clutter 
The clutter detectability factor (see Section 3.2.3) also adjusts the radar equation 
for departures of the probability density function of clutter voltage from Rayleigh 
(corresponding to two quadrature Gaussian components). Measurement programs 
of clutter on sea and land surfaces, especially those carried out at grazing angles 
below the critical value defined by (9.8), or with high spatial resolution (small Ac), 
have found significant departures from Gaussian statistics. The families of distri-
butions (probability density functions) used to describe surface clutter power are:

fied Bessel function (or K-function). The properties of this distribution, 
most commonly applied to sea clutter, are described in [1, p. 279] and [6, p. 
109].  
When many comparable scattering sources lie within the radar resolution cell, 
the probability density function of surface clutter voltage tends to the Rayleigh 
distribution (exponential distribution for power). Schleher [7, p. 261] gives the 
conditions for this as linear dimensions of about 75m, corresponding to a 
pulsewidth n  0.5 s and azimuth beamwidth given in degrees by a  4.3/Rkm. 
These conditions are generally met for air surveillance radars, but radars used for 
tracking, marine navigation, and maritime patrol often have smaller resolution 
cells.  
Barton [2] models the spread factors of both Weibull and lognormal distribu-
tions as a function of Fc and area of the resolution cell, as shown in Figure 9.4. 
That model captures the effect of reduced grazing angle that is a major contributor 
to formation of sea clutter spikes. It shows significant increases in the spread fac-

tor even for resolution cell areas much greater than the 5,000m2 suggested by 
Schleher’s criterion.

MODELS OF SEA CLUTTER 
The several parameters for expressing a surface clutter model may now be applied 
to two types of distributed surface clutter: sea and land. 
9.2.1 
Physical Properties of the Sea Surface 
Blake [3, pp. 306–308] lists the parameters used to describe the physical proper-
ties of the sea surface. The wave height is defined as the vertical distance between 
the wave to and the adjacent troughs. A Gaussian distribution of the vertical coor-
dinate h of the surface about its mean is normally assigned:

where h is measured relative to the average surface and h is its standard devia-

h1/3  
=  4h is the average wave height of the largest 1/3 of the waves; 
h1/10  =  5.2h is the average wave height of the largest 1/10 of the waves.

The same equations can be applied for the Beaufort wind scale number KB by re-
placing SS with KB  1. Table 9.1 lists the results for sea states 0 to 8. The slow 
increase in slope 0 with sea state results from the fact that both wavelength and 
wave height increase with wind speed, although not be the same factor. 
9.2.2 
Reflectivity of Sea Clutter 
When the constant- model is applied to sea clutter, averaging over all polariza-
tions and directions relative to the wind, a first-order model for  depends on the 
sea state or Beaufort wind scale KB and radar wavelength [2, p. 110, Eq. (3.37)]:

This expression results in variation of the intrinsic reflectivity factor  (and hence 
0 for a specific grazing angle) with SS0.6 and 1. Blake [3, p. 311] accepts as 
“the present-day view” the inclusion of Fc
4 within 0, making it “customary to 
ascribe to 0 itself the frequency dependence that is actually the result of the inter-
ference effect.” As we have stated in Section 9.1.2, the separation of the two terms 
and use of the constant- model improves the understanding of the physical fac-
tors involved in surface clutter measurement and modeling. 
Based on (9.37) and using values in Table 9.1, the first-order model for the 
dependence on grazing angle of cFc
4 for sea clutter is shown for different radar 
wavelengths and for a medium sea in Figure 9.5. Three of the regions of defined 
in Section 9.1.2 can be identified:  
1. 
The zenith region, a narrow region near vertical incidence, where quasi-
specular reflection dominates.  
2. 
The near (free-space) region covering most grazing angles below 70, 
where the constant- model applies;  
3. 
The interference region, where the interference propagation factor is 
dominant. 
The product 0Fc
4 for sea clutter in the interference region reaches such low lev-
els that intermediate and diffraction regions are seldom of interest, although the 
propagation factor models of Section 9.1.2 applicable. However, atmospheric 
conditions over the sea often create ducts that invalidate simple diffraction mod-

els. 
Researchers [1, pp. 382–402] have explored the variation of 0 with polariza-
tion and wind direction, and have put forth detailed models in which these factors 
are considered. These variations are generally small enough that they are masked 
by uncertainties in the wind scale or sea state, and hence need not be considered in 
most models and analyses. Long [1, p. 353] states, with regard to sea clutter, that: 
Obtaining a valid description of the dependence of radar cross section on wavelength is diffi-
cult because one must make measurements simultaneously with at least two radars, while 
making quantitative sea state measurements. … The problem is further complicated by the 
rapid time variations of the average value of 0 which can occur. Observations at a single 
wavelength indicate that “average” radar cross section can change as much as 10 dB in a 1-
minute interval. Therefore, the measurement errors and uncertainties tend to obscure the weak 
functional relationships that exist between 0 and  for most incidence angles. 
Given these uncertainties, it would appear that a first-order model such as (9.37) 
are adequate for most purposes. For those with interest in exploring second-order 
effects, Long’s text and a recent book [6] that explores the details of sea clutter 
statistics and models are recommended.  
9.2.3 
Power Spectrum of Sea Clutter

These expressions, plotted in Figure 9.6, apply to clutter generated by the capil-

radar bands, as observed by over-the-horizon radar [1, pp. 104–105]. 
The sea clutter spectrum is approximately Gaussian with a standard deviation

An approximation showing w proportional to sea state, presented by Blake [3, p.

linear relationship to vw is a better match to Nathanson’s data that were Blake’s 
source.

When passed through an envelope detector, the standard deviation of (9.39) is 
increased by 
2 . The intrinsic velocity spread vc is inserted in (9.21) to find the 
total spread v for a moving radar with a scanning antenna for use in (9.17). 
9.2.4 
Amplitude Distribution of Sea Clutter 
Measurement programs have been carried out on sea clutter over grazing angles 
from below 1 to 90. Most of the data have been collected in the interference 
region (above the critical grazing angle c and below the onset of specular facet 
reflections at 90  20). and represent 0 influenced only slightly by Fc
4. The 
measured distributions of power lie close to the exponential until the grazing angle 
approaches the interference region, where moderately spread versions of the 
lognormal, Weibull, or K-distributions appear.  
High-resolution measurements [9], in which a single wave crest may domi-
nate the resolution cell, have tended to show agreement with the lognormal distri-
bution, with dB between 4 and 6.1 dB. The corresponding ratios of average to 
median 0 are 1.8 and 4.3 dB, values that apply to Weibull spread factors a = 1.06 
and 1.65, respectively. At very low grazing angles and with high-resolution radar, 
sea clutter may be “spikey” in nature, described by larger spread factors for 
Weibull or lognormal distributions. 
9.3 Models of Land Clutter

scribed by its roughness (the standard deviation h from the average surface), the 
slope 0, and by the type and thickness of any vegetative cover. There are no 
standard terms that are associated with certain combinations of those parameters, 
but terms such as used in Table 9.2 can be used to describe several surface types 
as examples. The Gaussian model, however, fails to capture the effects of some 
natural and most manmade structures that rise from the surface, which are de-
scribed separately as discrete clutter in Section 9.4. 
Agreement of measured land-clutter data with the constant- model is shown 
in Figure 9.7. The data agree within 1 dB with the model for grazing angles in the 
near region.

9.3.1 
Reflectivity of Land Clutter 
The reflectivity of land clutter is much more difficult to characterize than that of 
the sea. The constant- model applies at grazing angles in the interference region, 
giving the values of  that are shown in Table 9.2. The reflectivity is almost inde-
pendent of wavelength, whose effect appears instead in the propagation factor for 
the intermediate and diffraction regions. Propagation considerations become the 
dominant factor at the low grazing angles applicable to surface-based radars. One 
study [11] showed that practically all of the variations in measured reflectivity of 
terrain could be attributed to the propagation factor, permitting use of a constant 
0 (e.g., 30 dB) to reproduce the measured mean and pdf, at least in the micro-
wave region.  
A first-order modeling approach [12] assumes a homogeneous surface with 
given h and  for each land type (Table 9.2), and assumes the radar antenna has 
been sited on a point 2h above the mean local surface. This leads to an antenna 
altitude above the mean surface hr = hr + 2h. A single family of curves for 0 
then results (Figure 9.8), which may be modified as needed for propagation fac-
tors at different wavelengths.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Studies and measurement programs on land clutter have been complicated by 
the fact that properties of the terrain underlying the path to clutter may differ from 
that in the resolution cells for which clutter is to be predicted or measured. For 
example, hilly terrain may be observed either on a path over a similarly hilly sur-
face, or over flat terrain with quite different properties. It is therefore essential to 
separate the propagation factor from the intrinsic reflectivity of the observed cell. 
In one major work on land clutter [10] where the product 0Fc
4 of these two fac-
tors was measured and analyzed statistically, it was found that the correlation be-
tween 0Fc
4 and grazing angle at the cell was weak and sometimes negative. 
Grazing angle was therefore excluded as a factor in the clutter model. The reason 
for absence of correlation is illustrated in Figure 9.9, which shows a simple case 
of corrugated terrain. The local surface slope is zero (by definition) at the tops of 
peaks and the bottoms of valleys, and maximum halfway between (where the 
mean surface level is shown by the dashed line). Thus, 0 is greatest halfway up 
the slopes facing the radar, drops to near zero at the peaks and valleys, and to zero 
on slopes facing away from the radar. The surfaces with maximum slope, howev-
er, are shadowed by the intervening peaks.  
Paths A and B in Figure 9.8, which arrive at the surface with the highest graz-
ing angles, are subject to knife-edge diffraction from the preceding peaks, where 
the two-way propagation factors Fc
4  12 dB. That loss applies in spite of optical 
“visibility” of the surface. Path C, with grazing angle and 0 near zero, has path 
clearance sufficient to give Fc
4  0 dB. Diffraction theory predicts a continuous 
variation in F, rather than an abrupt drop from unity to zero, between the region of 
adequate clearance above the intervening terrain and the shadowed region. As a 
result, no positive correlation should be expected between grazing angle and 
0Fc
4 for “visible terrain.” The constant- model does not predict that there should 
be positive correlation with the product 0Fc
4 in the intermediate region, and sug-
gests that the correlation may be negative for some surface contours.  
This is only one example of the complexity introduced by the propagation 
factor that results from terrain between the radar and the cell being measured or 
modeled. A purely statistical analysis that ignores propagation theory cannot pro-
vide an adequate basic for land clutter modeling. The applicability of separate 
modeling of Fc and 0, shown in [11], suggests that propagation alone contributed 
.

most of the statistical spread in clutter echo power, so a model such as shown in 
Figure 9.4 should be useful. 
Another misinterpretation of measured data leads to the idea that 0 in tree-
covered terrain increases as the grazing angle approaches zero, attributed to specu-
lar scattering from vertically oriented cylindrical tree trunks [13]. The strong in-
crease shown in these data are directly traceable to the terrain contour between the 
radar site and the clutter measured at the longest ranges in that experiment. The 
assumption was made that grazing angle varied inversely with measurement 
range, as would be true for terrain on a flat Earth (or spherical Earth at relatively 
short ranges). In the actual case, the terrain changed from a basically level surface 
to rising ground at the longest ranges measured, causing the local grazing angle to 
increase after having decreased with range over the level portion. It was the up-
ward tilt of the terrain, and the accompanying increase in propagation factor, ra-
ther than the presence of vertically oriented tree trunks, that caused the increase in 
reflectivity. 
As the next step beyond the first-order model of Table 9.2, it is often possible 
to model two or more surface regions in each azimuth sector of a specific radar 
site with different average surface slopes (not 0, but averages over much larger 
regions), and different roughness parameters and vegetation. These can be used to 
estimate both Fc and 0 for cells at different rages in an azimuth sector. Where 
surface features are present that can be not modeled by a Gaussian distribution of 
heights, discrete clutter sources may be added to the model. Beyond this step, a 
site- and azimuth-dependent propagation model such as SEKE [14], used in [11], 
can be used. 
9.3.2 
Power Spectrum of Land Clutter 
The velocity spectrum of land clutter is narrow, and has been modeled as Gaussi-
an with v < 0.5 m/s for vegetation in windy conditions. However, excellent data 
have been gathered with a coherent clutter measurement system having large dy-
namic range [10, Chapter 6] that show the actual spectrum to have an exponential 
shape (Figure 9.10). The total power of all the spectra plotted in this figure is 
normalized to unity. The exponential spectrum for windy conditions has 94% of 
its power within 0.5 m/s, compared to 95% for a Gaussian spectrum with v = 
0.20 m/s. Neither type of spectrum shows the broad spread of power predicted by 
power-law equations of the form 1/[1 + (f /fa) n], where n = 2 or 3. Reported clutter 
data [16] showing such spectra can be explained by presence of nonlinearity (e.g., 
logarithmic characteristics) in the receivers used for measurement.

The accurately measured data also show a nonfluctuating (DC) component 
with the power ratio r of dc to ac given by [10, p. 580, Eq. (6.4), modified for met-
ric units]:

where the constant in the numerator applies for vw in meters per second. Spread 
components from antenna scan (9.19) and platform motion (9.20), with vs = 0, 
must be combined with the spectra of Figure 9.10 and the DC component by con-
volution. Unless the internal motion component is dominant, the result is approx-
imately Gaussian with a standard deviation given by (9.21) for the fluctuating 
component and (9.22) for the DC component. As noted earlier, the slowly falling 
spectra reported in [15] with velocities beyond the physical limits of scatterer mo-
tion should not be used. 
9.3.3 
Amplitude Distribution of Land Clutter 
The measured amplitude distributions of land clutter in the zenith and near (plat-
eau) regions are Rayleigh (exponential power), until near the transition to the in-
terference region, where Weibull or lognormal distributions apply. The change 
from Rayleigh to more widely spread distributions follows the model shown in

DISCRETE CLUTTER 
The broadly spread Weibull and lognormal distributions do not normally extend to 
the high peak values contributed by manmade and some natural land features. 
Birds in flight and land vehicles are also sources of clutter that require models 
separate from those of sea and land clutter.  
9.4.1 
Discrete Land Features 
Of the several types of discrete clutter, buildings (including towers and water 
tanks) present the largest RCS. Table 9.3 shows different models of discrete land 
clutter taken from the literature [16–19], along with a recommended model for 
general use. Large, rigid sources can be regarded as having very small spatial ex-
tent (typically only one or a few meters) and spectra of essentially zero width. 
They establish the dynamic range at the input to the receivers of most systems, 
and place special requirements on methods of controlling false alarms.  
9.4.2 
Birds and Insects 
The clutter produced by birds was not discussed by Blake, although it poses a ma-
jor problem for naval and other types of radar attempting to detect and track low-

altitude targets. The bird RCS for mid-microwave bands can be modeled by a 
lognormal pdf, with a median 50 = 30 dBsm and a standard deviation y = 6 dB. 
This implies that only 0.13% of the bird population exceeds 12 dBsm. However, 
populations of birds are such that there may be 105 birds within 50 km of the ra-
dar, of which 130 exceed 12 dBsm. Variation with radar wavelength and type of 
bird is discussed in [8, p. 184; 19]. Bird RCS is not sensitive to polarization, nor 
are the larger bird RCS values sensitive to wavelength (at least for  < 0.3m). 
Small birds become resonant near that wavelength, and are in the Rayleigh region 
at longer wavelengths. Larger birds resonate in the UHF bands, but all are in the 
Rayleigh region for VHF and lower bands. 
The most damaging feature of the bird population, in modern Doppler radar 
systems, is its velocity distribution. The birds move at air speeds as great as 25 
m/s, and [21, 22] show an approximate Gaussian distribution with a mean of 15 
m/s and a standard deviation of 5 m/s. 
Migrating birds are generally distribution exponentially in altitude, with a 
scale height near 1 km, occasionally extending upwards to 5 km or more, although 
most local birds are at lower altitudes. This means that that the birds are often at 
altitudes high enough to provide free-space propagation, Fc = 1, or even in reflec-
tion lobes for which Fc  2. A bird with average  = 12 dBsm may appear in the 
radar with Fc
4 = 0 dBsm. This, and the presence of multiple birds in a flock, 
makes it impossible to reject birds on the basis of signal thresholding unless the 
desired targets lie well above 0 dBsm. Only filtering based on velocity can be re-
lied upon to reject bird clutter, and this requires either a broad Doppler rejection 
notch or tracking to determine absolute velocity as a basis for discarding the in-
formation. It should be noted that track files on detectable birds cannot be 
dropped, because the entire detection and track initiation process would then have 
to be repeated on subsequent detections. 
A similar consideration applies to insects [20], for which the median of the 
log-normal distribution may be 70 dBsm 10 dB in microwave bands. For a 
standard deviation y = 6 dB, the mean is increased to 70 + 5 = 65 dBsm. 
Clouds of thousands of insects then have mean  30 dBsm with a Rayleigh dis-
tribution. A propagation factor that can average up to +8 dB places insects also 
within the detection capabilities of modern systems.7  
                                                           
7  This writer had occasion in 1947–49 to detect and automatically track individual insects at ranges of 
hundreds of meters, using an X-band variant of the World War II SCR-584 fire control radar at 
White Sands Proving Ground. The radar had a peak power of 60 kW, pulsewidth of 0.5 s, and a re-
flector diameter of 1.8m. On close arrival at the radar, these insects proved to be dragonflies.

9.4.3 
Land Vehicles 
Land vehicles become a clutter problem for many air surveillance radars, because 
their RCS is comparable to that of aircraft, and their velocities lie in the passband 
of MTI and many pulsed Doppler systems. Here, at least, the propagation factor 
almost always favors the desired (aircraft) target, which necessarily lies at higher 
altitude than the land vehicle, which is often in the diffraction region. However, 
when there are dozens or hundreds of land vehicles within line of sight of the ra-
dar, false alarms are inevitable unless velocity filtering removes targets whose 
velocities are below  40 m/s.  
9.4.4 
Wind Turbines 
A radar clutter problem that has risen since Blake’s work is the wind turbine. The-
se are increasingly appearing in farms of tens of turbines, with individual blade 
lengths up to 40m, mounted on towers that place the blades up to 200m above the 
local terrain. The towers themselves constitute strong discrete clutter sources with 
zero Doppler. The blades, rotating at 10–30 rpm, have tip velocities up to 75 m/s 
and peak RCS exceeding +40 dBsm, and hence can pass through most Doppler-
based signal processors. At this writing, the IEEExplore database contains some 
40 papers on radar interference caused by wind turbines. Only a few of these pro-
vide data that can be used for modeling and analysis. Some attempt to predict the 
effect of an extended shadowed region beyond the turbine, in which echo power 
from desired targets may be reduced, but the probability of a target lying within 
such a shadow is negligible. The primary effect of turbines is to create strong, 
discrete clutter accompanied by high-velocity components from periodic specular 
“flash” from the blades. 
One useful paper from this set [23] includes a histogram of calculated RCS 
values, showing a continuous Rayleigh-like distribution with a peak (and median) 
value near +16 dBsm, combined with a low-probability values extending up to 
+44 dBsm, representing the periodic blade flashes. The paper emphasizes that 
objects like wind turbines are usually viewed at ranges shorter than their far-field 
range at which RCS is defined, and that surface reflections cause large departures 
from the plane wave on which most computational models are based.

MODELS OF VOLUME CLUTTER 
Volume clutter appears in two forms: precipitation, and chaff. The methods of 
modeling are similar, as both occupy a volume in space and consist of huge num-
bers of scatterers distributed over the volume with slowly varying densities. With-

336 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
in a radar resolution cell, the density of scatterers can normally be considered con-
stant, except when the lower edge of the elevation beam falls below the horizon, 
or the upper edge lies above the maximum elevation of the clutter volume. The 
result is a very close approximation to Rayleigh pdf, and a velocity spectrum de-
termined by motion of the air mass in which the scatterers are embedded. 
9.5.1 
Volume Clutter Cross Section and Reflectivity 
The radar cross section of volume clutter is given by the product of the volume Vc

scattering particles, expressed in m2/m3:

The integration over elevation angle in (9.43) is equivalent to that in (3.46), in that 
the clutter reflectivity is defined as zero outside the limits occupied by the scatter-
ers. The integrals in (9.43) give the product of pattern-weighted extent of the clut-
ter and the reflectivity of clutter when it is present. Except in rare cases, the clutter 
is assumed to extend beyond the azimuth beamwidth, so integrals in that coordi-
nate are unnecessary.

Volume Clutter Pattern-Propagation Factor 
The effect of the antenna’s azimuth pattern is included in Lp, as is the elevation 
pattern when clutter fills the beam. The integrals in (9.43) replace Lp for clutter 
than does not fill the elevation beam. Inclusion of propagation effects is less criti-
cal for volume clutter than for surface clutter, but an interference pattern in eleva-
tion introduces a more complicated integral:

The expression given by Blake [3, p. 300, Eqs. (7.18) and (7.19)] to express the 
power received from volume clutter includes within the integral the atmospheric 
attenuation coefficient, which may vary with range as a result of precipitation. 
This loss is expressed as a separate term in (3.4) and subsequent equations for 
received clutter energy, and evaluated in Section 7.3. We use calculations of the 
product Fc
4 without involving the attenuation to clarify the origin of the clutter

echoes. It should be remembered that clutter energy from ambiguous ranges must 
be calculated using (3.5), using the attenuation applicable to each ambiguity. 
The volume clutter propagation factor Fc may be defined as the fourth root of 
the ratio of the integral in (9.44) to that in (9.43). In the presence of strong reflec-
tions over the elevation beam (  1), Fc4  6 (or +8 dB), a factor large enough to 
require inclusion in the radar equation.  
9.5.3 
Spectral Properties of Volume Clutter 
The spectral properties of volume clutter have the same effects on the radar equa-
tion as did those of surface clutter: the improvement factor Im depends on the loca-
tion and shape of the clutter spectrum, and the clutter detectability factor depends 
on the correlation of clutter samples being integrated by the processor. Nathanson 
[8, p. 240, Eq. (6.10)] expressed the standard deviation of the volume clutter ve-
locity spectrum as the sum of four components. We add here the component va 
caused by antenna scanning:

vb  =  spread caused by varying radial velocity across the azimuth beam-
width; 
vf  =  spread caused by projection of the particle fall velocity across the el-
evation beamwidth. 
A value vc  1 m/s is normally assigned to the turbulence component, but 
Nathanson notes that extreme values vary over 0.5 < vc < 2 m/s. The antenna 
scanning component is given by (9.19), and the azimuth beam-broadening com-
ponent by (9.20), as for surface clutter. The wind-shear component, when clutter

The wind-shear spreading component when clutter occupies only a portion of the

velocity as a function of altitude, weighted by the fourth power of the pattern-
propagation factor, to yield a velocity spectrum for a given range:

When sidelobe or backlobe clutter is encountered at significant levels, it spec-

at levels determined by the envelopes of the corresponding lobe structure. 
9.5.4 
Amplitude Distribution of Volume Clutter 
In most case the huge number of scatterers contributing to volume clutter in the 
resolution cell ensures a Rayleigh distribution of amplitudes. One report [24] 
shows measurements of rain clutter following Weibull distributions with spread 
factors as high as aw = 1.6. It is possible that such distributions will apply to a 
range interval extending over different portions of a cloud, from the edges to the 
center, for which the average reflectivity changes significantly. However, unless 
these gradients are quite steep the statistics over the typical CFAR window should 
adhere closely to the Rayleigh distribution, and a range-dell-averaging CFAR 
should not experience excessive false alarms. 
9.5.5 
Precipitation Clutter Models 
Models of precipitation clutter are well defined, possibly due to the intensive ap-
plication of weather radar to measurement of rainfall rates [25]. The radar cross 
section of a spherical drop of water with diameter D  /16, meeting the Rayleigh 
small-sphere approximation, is [25, p. 35, Eq. (3.6)]:

Values of |Kw|2 are 0.91 to 0.93 for water in microwave and millimeter-wave 
bands. For ice the corresponding value is |Ki|2 = 0.18.

The amplitude distribution of precipitation is Rayleigh, and the velocity spec-
trum is as discussed in Section 9.5.3. A significant property of precipitation clutter 
is that the echo of a circularly polarized (CP) transmission is returned with CP of 
the opposite sense. This permits the polarization factor Fpc in (3.4) and subsequent 
equations for clutter energy to be reduced, typically by 20–25 dB, by designing 
the receiving antenna to respond to the same CP sense that was transmitted, with 
lesser reduction for heavy rain and snow. The loss in target energy with this ar-
rangement is 2–4 dB for aircraft targets, and hence a CP improvement factor in 
signal-to-clutter ratio can be as much as 20 dB, at the expense of reduced range in

bands. Adjusted values are derived as a function of wavelength in the Mathcad worksheet on the 
DVD, which was used in preparing Figure 9.11. The procedure can be reviewed in the PDF file of 
that worksheet by those lacking the Mathcad program.

Chaff Models 
The RCS of an individual dipole of chaff viewed broadside is 0.862. The average 
over all aspect angles drops to 0.152. Early data on aluminum chaff gave a total 
RCS, as a function of its weight W in kilograms, frequency f0 in GHz, and wave-
length  in m as

for chaff dipoles cut to resonate at . More recent data [26, p. 420] show that 
modern aluminized-glass chaff can achieve more than twice the RCS given by 
(9.62) over a two-octave band, with  taken as the geometric mean value. The 
reflectivity across that bandwidth is shown in Figure 9.12. For  > 0.3m, resonant 
dipoles may give way to long streamers called rope, producing lower RCS for its 
weight, but being less subject to breakage. Chaff falls slowly with a motion tend-
ing to randomize the orientation of individual dipoles, and hence is not very sensi-
tive to the radar polarization, although stronger response is seen for horizontal

polarization, especially for times well after deployment. 
The amplitude distribution of chaff is Rayleigh, and the spectral properties 
are as discussed in Section 9.5.3. Significant difference between chaff and precipi-
tation clutter are that chaff echoes cannot be canceled by use of CP, and chaff can 
appear at much higher altitudes. The latter can be exploited by the attacking force 
to produce clutter beyond the unambiguous range of the radar waveform, where 
wind shear displaces the average velocity from that of shorter-range clutter [2, p. 
121]. The resulting broad clutter spectrum requires a broader Doppler rejection 
notch than would be required for clutter in a single range ambiguity.

CLUTTER IMPROVEMENT FACTOR 
Clutter can be reduced through filtering based on its relatively low Doppler shift. 
The voltage response of an arbitrarily defined Doppler filter as a function of ve-
locity, normalized for unity power gain on white noise, can be expressed as a

These expressions can be applied to MTI and pulsed Doppler signal processors,

terized by a standard deviation v and a mean velocity v0.

Coherent MTI Improvement Factors 
Coherent MTI refers to systems in which the transmitter is coherent over the 
number of pulses used in the canceler, and also to coherent-on-receive systems in 
which a coherent oscillator (COHO) in the receiver is locked to the transmitter 
pulse. The velocity response of an m-delay canceler using binary weights is

For a Gaussian spectrum, the performance of a coherent MTI system using 
binary weights for two, three, and four pulses can be expressed in terms of the 
standard deviation and mean velocity of the clutter spectrum, the number of cas-
caded cancelers, and the velocity v0f to which the null has been adjusted. To arrive 
at expressions that are independent of the radar wavelength  and pulse repetition 
frequency fr, it is convenient to normalize the spectral parameters to the basic 
blind speed vb of the radar waveform:

Blake considers the overall improvement factor that results from the clutter 
spread, as in (9.74)(9.76), along with limitations from internal circuit instability,

This expression, which implies summing of output residue power calculated sepa-

when the second and subsequent terms result from instabilities that are random 
from pulse-to-pulse. If those terms are correlated, increasing the spread z, or the 
factors 1/4
z in (9.75) or 1/6
z in (9.76) cause a much greater reduction in im-
provement factor than would result from random instabilities.

Noncoherent MTI Improvement Factors 
Noncoherent MTI uses samples of the clutter itself to establish the reference phase 
against which targets and clutter are detected. The performance is generally infe-
rior to that of coherent MTI, but it has the advantage of maintaining the null at v0:

Other MTI Considerations 
In applying the improvement factor expressions of Sections 9.6.1 and 9.6.2, sever-
al issues listed below must be considered, extending beyond the models of clutter 
spectra and processor velocity response. 
 
MTI losses. The improvement factor from MTI processing is diluted by the 
presence of several MTI loss terms, discussed in Section 10.2.5. Those loss-

348 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
es apply over the entire range segment in which MTI processing is used, 
and they affect the detection range even for targets at ranges where no clut-
ter is present unless steps are taken to apply the processing only in cluttered 
regions.  
 
CFAR losses. The presence of uncanceled clutter may require use of con-
stant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) detection, introducing another loss term (Sec-
tion 10.2.5). 
 
Multiple-time-around clutter. All the expressions given in Sections 9.6.1 are 
limited to cases in which coherence is maintained for clutter over all the 
pulses used in the canceler process. If multiple-time-around clutter (returned 
from sources beyond the unambiguous range Ru = c/2fr of the waveform) is 
present, fill pulses, in addition to those used in the canceler, must be trans-
mitted following each change in waveform (e.g., PRF, RF, or phase modu-
lation within the pulse) or beam position (other than the small changes of a 
continuously scanning beam), so that the same clutter appears in each can-
celer pulse. Staggered PRF or pulse-to-pulse frequency agility are incom-
patible with MTI when multiple-time-around clutter is present. In addition, 
the coherent-on-receive technique cannot be used when multiple-time-
around clutter is present. A theoretical solution to using coherent-on-receive 
with multiple-time-around clutter has been proposed, but the complexity 
and losses involved render it impractical for most applications. 
 
Staggered PRF. Use of staggered PRF imposes a limit to improvement fac-
tor [28, p. 2.44]. 
 
Nonlinearity. The Gaussian spectrum appearing at the receiver input is mod-
ified by any nonlinearity prior to the MTI canceler [28, 29], greatly reduc-
ing the achievable improvement factor. 
9.6.4 
Pulsed Doppler Processing 
In pulsed Doppler radar, nc pulses are transmitted during a coherent processing 
interval (CPI). The processor combines the returns from np = nc  nf pulses (after 
gating out a number nf of fill pulses from the beginning of the CPI, where nf varies 
from 0 to some fraction of nc) to form a bank of np filters. The filter gains may be 
fixed or adjusted by a CFAR process to adapt the response to exclude (or reduce 
to noise level) the receiver output over the clutter spectrum. It is customary to 
describe the performance of the pulsed Doppler filter in terms of its clutter atten-
uation CA. 
There is considerable variety in the velocity response of the PD processor, but 
in general it can be described as having the following properties: 

 
Clutter and Signal Processing 
349 
 
A rejection notch with voltage response H0 << 1 and width v m/s, centered 
at or near v = 0; 
 
A transition region on each side of the notch of width v, over which re-
sponse varies from H0 at v = 0.5v to H = 0.5 at v = (0.5v + vb/np), and to 
unity at v =(0.5v + 2vb/np); 
 
An full-response region in which response remains at unity out to v =0.5vb;  
 
Repetition of this response at intervals vb over the receiver bandwidth; 
 
Ability to adaptively shift the center of the clutter spectrum to the center of 
the notch.

350 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
v = 1.1 m/s for np = 8 and 3.1 m/s for np = 16. The sharper response obtained 
with 16 pulses reduces the width of the transition region, in which the response 
rises from the notch depth to 6 dB. In this case np = 16 gives acceptable target 
response over 82% of the blind speed, as opposed to 73% for 8 pulses. Adequate 
clutter attenuation would be available for blind speeds as low as 20 m/s, but the 
lost fraction of target response would increase, significantly reducing the probabil-
ity of target detection.  
In practice, the idealized response is approximated using a bank of Doppler 
filters such as shown in Figure 9.14, where several filters containing significant 
clutter are desensitized (e.g., by range-cell-averaging CFAR) to form a deep 
notch. Weighting of the inputs holds the filter sidelobes below the level of the 
rejection notch. The response envelope of the sensitive filters forms the target 
detection region, in which dips between filters introduce a small filter straddling 
loss (see Section 10.2.5). The width of the transition region on each side of the 
notch is approximately equal to the filter spacing vb/np, while the 6-dB width of 
an individual filter is twice that spacing. 
The conventional definition for pulsed Doppler clutter attenuation given by 
(9.81) and (9.82) differs from that of MTI, in which the improvement factor is 
defined using a normalized response

The clutter attenuation available in a pulse Doppler filter bank is directly related 
to the ratio of blind speed and the fraction of the velocity response that are al-
lowed to fall below the 6 dB level. Figure 9.15 shows this relationship for a clut-
ter spread v = 1 m/s, with two blind speeds and 16 and 8 pulses. The curves may 
be applied to other cases with the same ratios of blind speed to clutter spread. 
From Figure 9.15 it can be seen that CA = 40 dB results in the loss of 14% to 
18% of potential target velocities with 16 pulses, for 60 < vb/v < 100, and 24% to 
27% of velocities with 8 pulses. These fractions are increased if greater CA is 
required, or reduced for increased vb/v and numbers of pulses. They may be re-
duced and possibly eliminated, except for the zero-velocity region, through use of 
PRF diversity on a group-to-group basis [2, pp. 243–245], if the beam dwell pro-
vides adequate time for exchange of two or more pulse groups. 
Further limitations in pulsed Doppler processor performance are similar to 
those described for MTI in Section 9.6.3.

9.6.5 
Clutter Maps 
A significant contribution of modern digital processing is the clutter map, which 
stores information on the level of input echoes in each small region in the radar 
coverage (ideally, each radar resolution cell), averaged over several antenna scans. 
Introduced originally by engineers at Lincoln Laboratory [30] as part of the so-
called moving target detector (MTD), the clutter map is included in many modern 
signal processors. One map function is to control the receiver gain to preserve 
linearity in cells containing strong clutter, holding the echoes to the level at which 
the Doppler processing can suppress the output to the average noise level of the 
system. This avoids the need for threshold control based on both the average and 
variance of clutter within a range-cell-averaging CFAR detection circuit (see Sec-
tions 10.2.5 and 10.2.6) with the accompanying loss.  
A second function of the clutter map is to select the processing mode to max-
imize detection probability as the clutter background changes (especially over 
land clutter). In cells containing only thermal noise, the signal is allowed to by-
pass the Doppler processor, providing detection of targets with radial velocities 
near zero or other blind speeds. Since targets moving tangentially to the radar pass 
from one resolution cell to the next without substantially affecting the average 
stored in the map, they are not suppressed by the processor. The map replaces the 
older procedure of manually selecting regions to which Doppler processing is ap-
plied (e.g., sector gating of MTI or normal video processing). 
The potential exists for generalizing the mapping process to adapt the pro-
cessing paths to different types of clutter and other interference. By using the re-
cent history of the interference environment it is possible to improve the perfor-
mance of adaptive processes that would otherwise be forced to rely on instantane-
ous response to interference that varies in time and spatial coordinates.

SUMMARY OF CLUTTER AND SIGNAL PROCESSING 
Clutter can be described as originating from a surface, with RCS c = Ac0; from a 
volume, with RCS c = Vcv; or from a discrete object with a specified c. The 
terms 0 and v are the clutter reflectivities. In each case, the power received by 
the radar is proportional to the product cFc
4 of RCS and a clutter pattern-
propagation factor. The factor Fc is the result of interaction of the antenna voltage 
pattern and a clutter propagation factor Fc that can be expressed separately as a 
function of the path geometry and radar wavelength. 
Five regions contributing surface clutter differ primarily by the nature of their 
pattern-propagation factors: 

 
Clutter and Signal Processing 
353 
1. Near region, in which Fc  1 and is determined by the antenna elevation pat-
tern; 
2. Interference region, in which Fc varies as a result of vector combination of di-
rect and reflected rays; 
3. Intermediate region, in which Fc depends on both interference and diffrac-
tion, 
4. Diffraction region, in which Fc = Fd, the propagation factor for smooth-
sphere or knife-edge diffraction; 
5. Zenith region, in which the beam of an airborne radar encounters specular re-
flection from tilted facets on the surface. In this region a specular component 
0
f is defined, Fc  1, and the antenna pattern is applied to form the average of 
0
f over the illuminated area. 
Measurements of surface clutter are commonly reported as representing 0, 
but in fact are 0Fc
4, requiring the pattern-propagation factor applicable to the 
measurement system be evaluated and adjusted before the data are applied to es-
timate the surface clutter for a radar whose performance is to be estimated. First-
order models of sea, land, and discrete clutter were presented in this chapter, con-
sidering the propagation effects on reported data. Models of precipitation clutter 
were presented that are relatively well defined as a result of extensive work in 
radar meteorology. A chaff model is taken from the electronic warfare literature. 
Power spectra and amplitude distributions are modeled for different clutter 
types, as necessary to determine their effects on signal processing improvement 
factors and losses in target detection discussed in Chapter 10. 
Clutter improvement factors of tens of decibels are available through use of 
Doppler processing, which also introduces blind speeds at multiples of the basic 
blind speed. Multiple-pulse dwells are required to support Doppler processing.

CHAPTER 10 
Loss Factors in the Radar Equation 
The radar equation often produces an inaccurate estimate of radar detection range, 
even in the benign environment of thermal noise. Blake’s formulation is an excel-
lent start, and his rigorous treatment of receiver noise, atmospheric effects, and 
propagation factors reduces the opportunity for error in those terms of the equa-
tion. Other areas still remain the source of persistent errors in the range estimate: 
the loss factors that are either listed separately in the equation or implicit in the 
detectability factor and other radar parameters. This chapter discusses the many 
loss factors that must be evaluated if the detection range is to be estimated accu-
rately.  
The term loss may be defined in many ways, but it refers here not only to the 
dissipation of energy in a resistive circuit element but to any factor in the radar or 
the external environment that prevents the signal from being received and used to 
full effect. The system loss L is included in (1.16), (1.18), and (1.19) without de-
tailed definition. Most radar texts include one or more loss actors, but leave it to 
the reader to identify and evaluate them. There is no standard procedure that en-
sures adequate accounting for losses, although [1] devotes a chapter to the loss 
budget. 
Losses affect radar in different ways. Some reduce the signal energy received 
by the radar, some reduce the fraction of that energy passed to the detection de-
vice, and others reduce the response to target echoes, increasing the received en-
ergy required to obtain the desired detection performance. Some are identified 
specifically (e.g., the transmission line loss Lt in the Blake chart (Figure 1.1), 
while others can be identified as components of a specified term (e.g., components 
of the miscellaneous loss Lx, which increases the effective detectability factor Dx 
in the radar equation), or as changes in other terms from values that might be ex-
pected (e.g., antenna losses). 

358 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Some loss factors, denoted by the symbol L, increase the denominator of the 
equation, while others are expressed as voltage gain factors F < 1 in the numera-
tor. The latter form is preferred when conditions can lead to F = 0. In the follow-
ing discussions, symbols for loss factors use a subscript to identify their source, 
modified with an additional subscript t for the transmitting path, r for the receiv-
ing path, c when applied to received clutter energy, and j for received jammer en-
ergy.  
10.1 
REDUCTION IN RECEIVED SIGNAL ENERGY 
Components of the loss L1, included in (1.7)(1.14) to describe reductions in re-
ceived RF energy, are identified in this section.

Terms Specified in the Radar Equation 
10.1.1.1 Transmission Line Loss Lt 
The loss Lt is listed specifically in the Blake chart (Figures 1.1, 1.2) and in (1.20), 
(1.22), (1.23), and(1.26). It is defined as the ratio of power output of the transmit-
ter (either peak or average) to that delivered to the antenna terminal at which Gt is 
defined. It includes dissipative losses listed in Table 10.1 and the effects of any 
impedance mismatch that reflects power back to the transmitter.

(1.20), (1.22), (1.23), and (1.26). It is defined as the ratio of energy that would be 
received on a radar path through a vacuum to the actual received energy, exclud-
ing the lens-loss effect, and is discussed in Sections 7.2 and 7.3. There is no sig-

nificant ionospheric absorption at frequencies in the radar bands, but a dispersive 
effect may introduce a loss described in Section 7.5.5. 
10.1.1.3 Pattern-Propagation Factor F 
The pattern-propagation factor F is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.  
10.1.1.4 Polarization Factor Fp 
The polarization factor Fp is the ratio of the field intensity received by the polar-
ized receiving antenna to the field intensity that would be received in a free-space 
environment if the receiving antenna polarization were matched to target reflec-
tion at the transmitted polarization. It is entered as a constant that depends on an-
tenna polarization and the shape of the echo source. 
Target cross section  is normally specified for a linear (H or V) transmitted 
and received polarization. Values of the polarization factor for typical targets and 
for rain are shown in Table 10.2. The polarization factor for snow is closer to uni-
ty than for rain, because the snowflakes depart more from a spherical shape. 
The polarization factor also describes the effect of ionospherically induced 
Faraday rotation when the antenna is linearly polarized, as discussed in Section 
7.5.4. In this case, the loss varies with the ionospheric path, and must be treated as 
a statistical factor, as described in Section 10.2.1. 
Jammer antennas are often linearly polarized at 45 or 135 to provide a po-
larization factor F2
pj = 3 dB against radars using H, V, LCP, or RCP (see Sections 
3.7 and 3.8). If the victim radar uses an adaptively polarized receiving antenna,

tions. 
10.1.2 
Components of Range-Dependent Response Factor Frdr 
The factor Frdr, introduced in (1.26), includes five range-dependent components, 
not separately listed and usually omitted in the radar equation, that reduce re-
ceived energy. 
10.1.2.1 Tropospheric Lens Factor Flens 
The component Flens of the range-dependent response factor Frdr is discussed in 
Section 7.4. It may be replaced by the lens loss Llens = 1/Flens in the denominator, 
but should remain separated from the atmospheric absorption because only the 
latter affects the system noise temperature. 
10.1.2.2 Sensitivity Time Control Factor Fstc 
STC is applied at RF or early in the receiver to reduce the dynamic range required 
of subsequent receiver stages. The receiver power gain to echoes within some 
selected range Rstc varies as

relative to the full receiver gain, and Xstc  4 is an exponent selected to maintain 
target detectability for R < Rstc. When the gain control is applied prior to the sig-
nificant sources of receiver noise, the signal-to-noise ratio is assumed to vary as 
F 2
stc relative to the value that would be obtained with full receiver gain. 
A more complicated relationship may be derived in cases where significant 
noise originates prior to the gain-controlled stage. STC is used only in low-PRF 
radar, and its effect is illustrated in Figure 1.5. It should be noted that a target at 
constant altitude, flying above the antenna mainlobe into a region covered by the 
csc2 extension of the elevation pattern, closes on the radar with constant SNR in 
the absence of STC. To prevent the STC factor from dropping the echo below the 
detection threshold, the upper coverage may be provided by patterns in which the 
exponent of the csc function is less than two, as illustrated in Figure 2.1.

10.1.2.3 Beam-Dwell Factor Fbd 
The factor Fbd is caused by beam motion occurring between transmission of a sig-
nal and reception of its echo. It varies with the target range R, and appears in sys-
tems that scan a beam continuously at a very rapid rate, and in those that step the 
beam to a new position prior to arrival of the echo from R.  
For a radar scanning continuously through one beamwidth in time to, with a 
target at range R whose signal time delay td = 2R/c, the beam-dwell factor is

s  = scan rate; 
 
3  = beamwidth in the scanned coordinate; 
 
f () = antenna voltage pattern.  
The beamshape loss is included as a multiplier in (10.4) to normalize Fbd to unity 
for  << 1. For example, the beam-dwell factor for a Gaussian beam pattern with 
td = 0.5to is F 2
bd = 1.5 dB. This loss is absent from electronically scanned arrays 
that rapidly step the beam between dwells in each position after receipt of all de-
sired echoes. 
10.1.2.4  Frequency Diversity Factor Ffd 
In frequency diversity, the frequency is changed between transmission of succes-
sive groups of nfd pulses. The retuned receiver has zero response, Ffd = 0, on the 
final nrt echo pulses of each group from targets at range R > ntrRu. With frequency 
agility, in which the radar frequency is changed from pulse to pulse, Ffd = 0 on all 
echoes from previous transmissions. This eliminates detection of clutter and re-
sponsive jammers as well as range-ambiguous targets. The effect does not appear 
in the standard radar equation, but should be included in computer programs that 
might otherwise include the rejected energy components from targets and interfer-
ence lying beyond the unambiguous range. In most applications, this is considered 
a desirable feature that eliminates interference rather than a “loss” factor. 
10.1.2.5 Eclipsing Factor Fecl 
Eclipsing occurs when the apparent time delay td = td(modulo tr) allows the echo 
pulse to overlap either the immediately preceding or following transmitted pulse. 

 
Loss Factors in the Radar Equation 
363 
Figure 10.2 shows in part (a) two successive transmitted pulses separated by the 
pulse repetition interval PRI = tr, and an echo pulse with delay td = 0.5tr. The sig-
nal is subject to eclipsing for delays such that|0.5tr  td| > 0.5tr  . Part (b) of the

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
In low- and medium-PRF radar using constant PRF, the deterministic factor 
given by (10.6) can be applied as a function of target range, producing identifiable 
regions adjacent to a transmitted pulse where Pd drops toward zero (see Figure 
1.4). In high-PRF radar, the target passes rapidly through the eclipsed regions, and 
PRF diversity during each beam dwell is commonly used to shift those regions to 
preserve some of the target returns. For that case, and for other radars in which Pd 
is to be averaged over pulse groups at different PRFs, a statistical loss factor (Fig-
ure 10.4) is found using the procedure given in Section 10.2.1. 
10.1.3 
Losses Included in System Noise Temperature 
Chapter 6 discussed the calculation of system noise temperature Ts. In addition to 
the receiver noise figure Fn, the three RF loss components listed below contribute 
to Ts. 
10.1.3.1 Receiving Line Loss Lr 
The loss Lr contains many of the components listed for Lt in Table 10.1, excluding 
the possible transmitter switch that connects to the dummy load. A bandpass filter 
to reduce out-of-band interference replaces the harmonic filter needed in some 
transmitters. An additional loss of 0.2–0.4 dB is often contributed by a solid-state 
limiter that protects the low-noise receiving amplifier. 
10.1.3.2 Antenna Dissipative Loss La in Noise Temperature 
The loss La varies significantly with antenna type, but may include the compo-
nents listed in Table 10.3. The antenna mismatch for an electronically scanned 
array may greatly exceed that of a mechanically scanned antenna or an array at 
broadside, as shown in Section 6.3.5. Values shown in the table apply for an ele-
ment pattern Ge() = cos3/2. 
10.1.3.3 Atmospheric Absorption Loss L in Noise Temperature 
This loss, applied in calculating system noise temperature in Section 6.3.1, is dis-
cussed in Sections 7.2 and 7.3.

Losses in the Search Radar Equation 
10.1.4.1 Cosecant Pattern Loss Lcsc 
Extension of the elevation coverage above the full-range coverage sector 1 of the 
mainlobe (see Figure 2.1) reduces the antenna gain. In the standard form of the 
radar equation, this appears as reduced Gt, Gr, or both, but in the search radar

equation the corresponding loss Lcsc appears in both the solid angle s of search 
coverage and as a component of the search loss Ls. Losses for the csc2 and csc 
patterns are given in (2.11) and (2.12) and shown in Figure 2.2, along with those 
for intermediate cases. 
10.1.4.2 Elevation Beamshape Loss Lpe  
The loss Lpe appears as a component of search loss Ls in the search radar equation 
for 2-D radar. Figure 2.1 shows a fan beam that provides the specified full-range 
coverage at elevation angle 1 = sin1Hm/Rm. The half-power beamwidth e re-
quired for this coverage exceeds the upper angle of full-range coverage 1 by the 
factor Lpe  1.5, reducing the gain Gt relative to that assumed in derivation of the 
search radar equation. The same factor must also be included in selecting the 
height of the antenna, reducing the aperture area A relative to that required for a 
given wavelength if the elevation beamwidth were set to 1. An approximation for 
this loss as a function of the ratio e/1 is

assumptions, and hence La
2 must be included as component of Ls to account for the 
loss in transmission and reception, in addition to inclusion of La in system noise 
temperature calculation. 
10.1.4.4 Pattern Constant Ln  
Section 2.6.1 discusses also the need to include this factor as a component of Ls to 
correct for the fact that Gt < 4/ae in actual antennas (as opposed to the rectan-
gular beam used in derivation of the search radar equation). The loss can be calcu-
lated from the beamwidth factor K and aperture efficiency a as

Values Ln = 1.16–1.28 dB apply to all antennas, with additional spillover loss 
 0.5 dB for lens or reflector antennas and blockage loss 0.6–1.2 dB for reflector 
antennas with feeds centered in front of the reflector. 
10.1.4.5 Antenna Illumination Loss L in Search Radar Equation 
When the physical aperture A is used in the search radar equation (2.7) or (2.8), 
the search loss Ls must include the illumination loss, to be discussed in Section 
10.1.5.1. That loss is applied only once to Ls, because the effect of illumination 
taper on the transmitting gain is included in the factor Ln. 
10.1.4.6 Scan Distribution Loss Ld  
The scan distribution loss describes the loss in integration performance when per-
forming two or more scans of the search volume during the search time ts. The 
detection requirements are met with a cumulative probability of detection rather 
than by Pd in a single scan. The loss is defined as the ratio of the SNR required 
when cumulative detection is performed over m scans with n/m pulses per scan to 
that required for a single scan with n pulses.  
Marcum [3, pp. 13–14] discusses the effect of using m groups of separately 
integrated pulses to achieve detection. He states that “it is always best for [m] to 
equal 1.” That observation is correct for a steady target under most conditions, but 
for fluctuating targets it may be possible to obtain better performance using two or 
more scans within the allocated search time.  
The loss is calculated using the expression for binary integration loss (Section 
10.2.5.1) with m = 1, modified by adjustment in other losses that are dependent on 
the single-scan Pd. For example, beamshape loss Lp and eclipsing loss Lecl increase

10.1.4.7 Other Losses in Search Radar Equation 
The other antenna losses discussed in Section 10.1.5.3 are also included in the 
search radar equation both for the transmitting and receiving directions, doubling 
their decibel contributions to Ls. In addition, all the losses contributing to Dx, as 
discussed below in Section 10.2, are included as components of Ls, since the de-
nominator of that equation uses the detectability factor D0(1) for a single pulse on 
a steady target. 
10.1.5 
Losses Included in Antenna Gain 
Several loss terms appear as reductions in antenna gains, but are listed here to 
ensure that they are included either there, in the pattern-propagation factor, or 
added separately to the radar equation. 
10.1.5.1 Antenna Illumination Loss L  
The antenna gains Gt and Gr are specified in the radar equation. They can calcu-
lated from the physical aperture area A using

where G0 is the aperture gain for uniform illumination and a is the aperture effi-
ciency. The illumination efficiency i is one component of aperture efficiency, 
and the illumination loss is defined as L = 1/i. This is shown in Figure 10.3 as a 
function of the sidelobe level, for rectangular apertures that use the same illumina-
tion taper in both coordinates and for elliptical apertures. For different illumina-
tions, the loss is the geometric mean of the two losses. The Hansen illumination 
refers to the one-parameter circular illumination discussed in [4, pp. 107–111].

cluded the dissipative loss component  = 1/La.

10.1.5.3 Other Losses in Antenna Gain 
The aperture efficiency a is assumed to include also the following losses: 
 Spillover loss:  0.5 dB for in a lens or reflector antenna;  
 Blockage: 0.6–1.2 dB for a reflector antenna; 
 Dimensional tolerance: rms phase errors , describing deviations of the aper-
ture by a distance as from its assumed form, cause a loss given by

where kas = 2 for reflector surfaces or 1 for planar arrays and lens surfaces. 
When the feed side and the radiating side of a lens have the same departure 
from their assumed form (e.g., bending of the entire structure), kas  0. 
 Signal bandwidth loss: While reflector and metallic lens antennas normally 
have bandwidths in excess of the signal bandwidth B, array antennas have 
limited bandwidth that can cause loss in gain for wideband signals, especially 
when scanned off broadside. This subject is discussed in [1, pp. 170–172.]. 
 Array phase error loss: the loss L = exp(
2), where  is the rms phase error 
of the feed and phase shifters.  
 Phase-shifter quantization loss: quantization of phase-shift control to m bits 
causes a loss

where 1 <  < 2 (usually 1.5). When the radar equation is applied to targets 
at a specific off-broadside angle, the antenna gains are reduced by this loss. It 
also applies with   1 to electrically fixed arrays constructed of slotted 
waveguide, from which the beam is squinted from broadside by a frequency-
dependent angle . When the radar equation uses the broadside gains, and de-
tection performance is averaged over a sector extending s from broadside, a 
scan loss is defined as the increase on on-axis SNR required to maintain the 
specified detection probability This is included as an increase in required sig-
nal energy (see Section 10.2.1). 
 Cosecant pattern loss: the loss Lcsc described in Section 10.1.4 reduces the an-
tenna gains Gt and Gr in a 2-D radar, and Gt in a stacked-beam 3-D radar. 
 Loss in water film: Most radar antennas pass the transmitted and received 
signals through a dielectric window or covering that separates the antenna or 
feed components from the environment. Loss in this dielectric material can be 
minimal, except in radomes that must withstand wind forces (see Table 10.3), 
but may increase when a water film is formed by condensation or precipita-
tion. Table 10.4 shows losses calculated for different film thicknesses at S- 
and Ku-bands. Water films on a reflector surface are seldom thick enough to 
cause loss, as the electric field at the surface falls to zero and is incapable of 
transferring energy to the water unless the film thickness is greater than hun-
dredths of a wavelength.

INCREASES IN REQUIRED SIGNAL ENERGY 
10.2.1 
Statistical Losses 
Some loss factors do not appear directly in the radar equation, but instead cause an 
increase in the effective detectability factor Dx that represents the on-axis energy 
ratio required to achieve the desired detection probability Pd. Some of these are

constant, but others are statistical losses, in that their value depends on averaging 
detection probability Pd over a variable z that represents target position in one of 
the four dimensions of radar space (or in polarization angle of the echo). A loss Lz 
is defined in each case as the increase in input signal-to-noise energy ratio E/N0 
that is required to maintain the desired Pd as z varies between specified values. If 
the required energy ratio for the idealized system is D, the requirement increases 
to LzD when Lz is present. Each of the several components Lz is calculated for the 
desired Pd, and the loss product is applied to obtain the effective detectability fac-
tor appearing in the denominator of (1.20), (1.23), and similar equations:

The general procedure for calculation of statistical loss is to express the re-

power ratio so applied to the detection device is then

where the root function is the value of so that meets the equality in the brackets. In

available to find this root for arbitrary pt(z), H(z), and target statistics. The corre-
sponding range-dependent response factor is F 2
rdr = 1/Lz. 
10.2.1.1 Eclipsing Loss Lecl 
The eclipsing loss is derived statistically from the range-dependent factor Fecl, and 
is used in the radar equation for high-PRF radar to find the range at which the 
average Pd for echoes whose apparent delay varies with z over specified limits (see 
Section 10.1.2.5). The factor Fecl(td) replaces H(z) in (10.21), with integration over 
0 < td < tr. Echoes are normally modeled as uniformly distributed over the PRI: 
pt(z) = 1.  
Figure 10.4 shows Lecl when averages of Pd are taken for Case 1 targets dis-
tributed uniformly within the PRI. It can be seen that high Pd leads to large losses

as duty cycle is increased. High cumulative probability of detection could be ob-
tained over two or more pulse groups with different PRIs, allowing reduced Pd per 
group with lower Lecl. 
This statistical loss may be compared with the loss Lecl defined as the recipro-
cal of H3
av averaged over tr, which are shown by the circles near the lower left por-
tion of the figure. The statistical loss is greater for Pd > 0.25, and much greater for 
Pd  1. 
10.2.1.2 Faraday Rotation Loss LFar 
The Faraday rotation angle (h) varies with the total electron count along the path 
to target altitude h, according to (7.44). The response of a linearly polarized radar 
antenna to this angle can be expressed as

This expression is substituted for H(z) in (10.21), and the integration is carried out

a function of Pd for rotations from zero to different maximum values m. The 
worst case occurs at m = 120 where HFar < 3 dB over 67% of the interval 0 to 
m. The average loss in received power for any number of full rotations is 3 dB,

but it can be seen that the statistical loss for m = 90 is greater than that average 
value when Pd > 20%. 
10.2.1.3 Scan Sector Loss Lsector 
Section 10.1.5.3 discussed the loss Lsc for the case where a specific scan angle is 
used. Where the scan is carried out over a sector in which a specified average Pd is 
to be obtained, the statistical loss procedure expression (10.21) is used over the 
limits of the scanned sector, with H() = cos/2() and pt() representing the prob-
ability density of target positions within the sector (normally assumed uniform). 
Figure 10.6 shows the scan sector loss as a function of Pd for different maxi-
mum scan angles m, for sectors extended over m. For comparison, the average 
loss in power over each sector is shown by circles on each line, and those values 
are exceeded for Pd > 20%.

Losses in Basic Detectability Factor 
The basic detectability factor, denoted by D0,…,4 for steady and Swerling targets, is 
the theoretical value before considering beamshape, matching, and signal pro-
cessing losses. Values are calculated as shown in Chapter 4, which also extends 
the theory to the detectability factor De for targets observed with diversity. Within 
these factors are included two losses that are applied to the basic single-pulse,

steady-target factor D01 in deriving the factors for n-pulse integration and for fluc-
tuating targets. These losses do not appear separately in the radar equation, but are 
useful in comparing the performance of different waveform and processing op-
tions. For example, Figure 4.12 shows the variation in their sum as a function of 
the number of diversity samples, with the optimum number of samples increasing 
from one to eight with detection probability. 
10.2.2.1 Integration Loss Li 
Integration loss is discussed in Section 4.4.3, and plotted in Figure 4.9 as a func-
tion of n for different values of D01 whose detection performance is to be matched 
using the received energy ratio nD0(n).  
10.2.2.2 Fluctuation Loss Lf 
Fluctuation loss is discussed in Section 4.4.5, and plotted in Figure 4.10 for the 
Case 1 target. Section 4.4.7 discusses how the loss varies with the number of in-
dependent target samples ne included in the n integrated pulses.  
10.2.2.3 Detector Loss Cx 
In Section 4.4.2 the loss in SNR resulting from the nonlinearity of the envelope 
detector was described by the detector loss Cx, defined relative to the SNR availa-
ble from a coherent (phase sensitive) detector with an in-phase reference voltage. 
An empirical expression

where s is the input SNR to the envelope detector, was found in [8] to reproduce 
with acceptable accuracy the performance of detection systems based on the out-
put of an envelope detector. This loss is included in the integration loss term, and 
need not be calculated separately. 
10.2.3 
Matching and Bandwidth Losses 
Blake’s basic radar equation (1.16) includes a bandwidth correction factor Cb to 
multiply the detectability factor when nonoptimum receiver bandwidth is used. 
Subsequent forms of the equation from work of Hall and Barton replaced Cb with 
a matching loss Lm or a matching factor M for application to electronic detection. 

376 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
10.2.3.1 Bandwidth Correction Factor Cb 
Section 1.5.4 notes that the factor Cb given by (1.17) is unsuitable for use with 
electronic detection devices. It remains useful to multiply the visibility factor V0 to 
characterize the visual detection process. The formal definition of Cb given by 
Blake [9, p. 366, Eq. (8.14)] would give the same result as the expression for 
matching loss in the following section, but the plotted value [9, p. 367, Figure 8-2] 
does not represent that result. Instead, it gives experimental values of the excess 
energy ratio required to maintain visibility of a display as receiver bandwidth is 
varied, as reported by Haeff [10]. Blake notes that the simple concept represented 
by the plots is inapplicable to radar that use “pulse bursts or other nonsimple 
waveforms.” 
10.2.3.2 Matching Loss Lm 
Section 1.4.1 presents Hall’s radar equation (1.20), in which the effective detecta-
bility factor is used to increase the basic detectability factor D(n) by five loss fac-
tors: Dx = D(n)LmLpLcLxL o. The matching loss Lm is defined as the ratio of peak 
output SNR of the matched filter to that of the mismatched filter, given the same 
input. It is calculated for a signal voltage spectrum A( f ) and filter response func-
tion H( f ) as

Figure 10.7 shows the loss as a function of the product of pulsewidth  and receiv-
er noise bandwidth Bn for an uncoded rectangular pulse with different filter types. 
Other than the (sinx)/x matched filter, the best performance is Lm = 0.5 dB ob-
tained with a Gaussian filter, which represents a cascade of several single-pole 
filters with and overall response Bn = 0.8. 
Figure 10.8 shows the matching loss as a function of time-sidelobe level for a 
weighted linear-FM waveform with different weighting functions. The curves 
follow those for illumination taper loss given in Figure 10.2(a).

10.2.3.3 Matching Factor M 
In Barton’s radar equation (1.23) and the accompanying modified Blake chart of 
Figure 1.2, Lm is replaced by the matching factor M. This factor includes two mod-
ifications to Lm: 
 When the receiver filter has Bn > 1 and the postdetection (video) bandwidth 
Bv  Bn/2, the matching loss Lm describes the reduction on SNR at the detec-
tion circuit. However, in many cases Bv < Bn/2 provides reduction in the noise 
leaving the receiver. The result is an effective bandwidth that is the lesser of 
Bn or 2Bv for rectangular filters, and otherwise is given by

The greater noise entering the envelope detector leads to a collapsing ratio 
Bn/Beff and causes a collapsing loss Lc (see Section 10.2.5.4). The product of 
Lm from (10.25) and Lc gives the correct matching factor M, which is general-
ly less than Lm calculated from Bn alone. The difference is often small enough 
to be neglected.  
 For Beff < 1 the peak SNR is reduced according to (10.24), but the output 
pulse is broadened and fewer noise samples reach the envelope detector dur-
ing the periods when signal is absent. This reduces the false-alarm rate and 
permits increasing the false-alarm probability, reducing the threshold and the 
required detectability factor Dx relative to that calculated using Lm alone. 
Since small changes in Pfa have little effect on D, this difference is often 
small enough to be neglected. 
In most cases, use of Lm from (10.25), Figure 10.7 or Figure 10.8 is sufficient-
ly accurate for use without the extra calculations involved in finding the effective 
bandwidth and the adjustment for false-alarm probability. 
10.2.4 
Beamshape Loss Lp 
The beamshape loss is the subject of Chapter 5, and applies to all radars during 
search and acquisition of a target unless the beam axis can be placed on the target 
within a small fraction of the beamwidth. In using the Blake chart or creating a 
vertical coverage chart (see Figure 1.6), the target position relative to the beam-
axis in elevation is included in the pattern-propagation factor F, and only the one-
dimensional beamshape loss appears as a multiplier of detectability factor in the 
denominator of the radar equation. However, when the search radar equation is 
used or when detection probability over a two-dimensional angle sector is calcu-
lated, the two-dimensional loss Lp2 from Sections 5.4 and 5.5 is used instead of F. 
Notations used in Chapter 5 to distinguish different beamshape losses are: 
 Lp0  =  one-coordinate loss with dense sampling; 
 Lp1  =  one-coordinate loss for general case; 
 Lp2  =  two-coordinate loss for general case; 
 Lpn  =  net beamshape loss after adjustment for beam spacing, as used in 
search radar equation; 
 LpT  =  two-coordinate loss for triangular beam grid.

Signal Processing Loss Lx 
The miscellaneous loss Lx that appears in the Blake chart consists of several com-
ponents listed below that result from signal processing that does not preserve the 
SNR at the receiver output. These are not necessarily the result of design defects, 
but may accompany steps necessary to reject false alarms from clutter and other 
interference. 
10.2.5.1 Binary Integration Loss Lb 
Binary integration uses a double-threshold system in which each of n pulses is 
applied to the first threshold to achieve probabilities of detection pd and false 
alarm pf. Outputs from the first threshold are accumulated over n pulses, and an 
alarm is issued when at least m outputs out of the n pulses are obtained. It is a sub-
stitute for video integration, and is sometimes called m-out-of-n integration.  
The probability of obtaining j outputs from the first threshold is

A comparison of the integration loss for optimum binary integration with the 
video integration loss Li(n) is shown in Figure 10.9. The extra loss with binary 
integration, beyond that for video integration, is the binary integrator loss, denot-
ed by Lb, and is approximately 1.4 dB for n 5. Accepting this approximation, the 
tedious processes of solving (10.29) for required single-pulse probabilities may be 
avoided by using the equations for video integration and increasing the signal pro-
cessing loss by Lb = 1.5 dB. This loss is often considered acceptable, both because 
of the saving in hardware complexity and the fact that 1-bit A/D conversion offers 
significant protection against interference from random pulses of large amplitude. 
No matter how large the interfering pulse, it can only add one to the count of first-

threshold crossings. For n 2, 3, and 4 the loss rises above the curve plotted in Fig-
ure 10.9, reaching 1.6, 2.2, and 2.4 dB, respectively.  
Also shown in Figure 10.8 is the curve for binary integration with m = 1, 
sometimes called cumulative integration. When cumulative integration is per-
formed over n > 1 scan, the difference between Li for video integration and Lb for 
m = 1 is the scan distribution loss (see Section 10.1.4). 
10.2.5.2 CFAR loss Lg 
CFAR loss results from use of an adaptive threshold that reduces false alarms 
from variable or non-Gaussian interference. A typical implementation is the 
range-cell-averaging CFAR shown in Figure 10.10. The envelope-detected out-
puts of m adjacent range cells are available simultaneously from a tapped delay 
line in which the center tap represents the detection cell. The m reference taps are 
averaged to form an estimate w of the noise and interference near the target within 
the radar beam, and the ratio of the detection cell amplitude xs to this average is 
used as the video output. In effect, the threshold level Et is scaled to the estimate 
of local noise rather than to an a priori value as in previous discussions. 
The estimate of interference level as the average of m adjacent samples is 
subject to error, so the weight w applied to that average must be set higher than 
the value applicable to a perfect estimate. Hence, the threshold, varying about the 
correct estimate, is too high most of the time, reducing Pd relative to that for a 
fixed threshold at the correct level. This requires an increase in SNR, by an 
amount that is called the CFAR loss. Figure 10.11 shows that loss for single-pulse 
detection (n = 1). 
The effective number of reference samples meff in Figure 10.11 is calculated 
as follows, where m is the number of taps in Figure 10.10:

10.2.5.3 Integrator Weighting Loss Lv 
The ideal video integrator process applies weights to each of the n pulses that 
match the envelope of the two-way antenna gain of a scanning radar. This is the 
process used in Chapter 5 to calculate beamshape loss Lp0 = 1.33 = 1.24 dB. Blake 
[13, 14] obtained a loss Lp = 1.6 dB by assuming an integrator with uniform 
weight over an optimum fraction of the half-power beamwidth, which added 0.27

dB of integrator weighting loss to the inherent beamshape loss. For other 
weighting functions (e.g., the exponential or double-exponential analyzed by 
Trunk [15, 16]), the loss Lv varies from 0.14 to 0.34 dB.  
Uniform weights are optimum for pulses received during the fixed beam 
dwell of an electronically scanned radar. 
10.2.5.4 Collapsing Loss Lc 
Collapsing loss is defined [17] as 
The increase in required input signal-to-noise ratio to maintain a given probability of detec-
tion when resolution cells or samples containing only noise are integrated along with those 
containing signals and noise. Note: This type of loss occurs, for example, when radar returns 
containing range, azimuth and elevation information are constrained to a two-dimensional 
display. 
The 2-D display collapses the information obtained from three dimensions. 
The collapsing ratio  is defined as 
 
m
n
n


 
(10.32) 
where n is the number of samples containing signal and noise and m is the number 
containing noise alone. The collapsing loss, when using a square-law detector,1 is 
calculated as in increase in integration loss Li, given by

when the false-alarm probability Pfa is held constant. In other cases, when the res-
olution cell is broadened by the collapsing process (e.g., excessive width of a 
range gate used for integration or broadening of the pulse from insufficient band-
width or display resolution), the false-alarm time may be held constant by allow-
ing an increased false-alarm probability Pfa and reducing the loss from (10.33) 
by the ratio of D(n) for Pfa to D(n) for Pfa:

10.2.5.5 MTI Losses Lmti 
Three MTI losses are recognized: 
 Noise correlation loss Lmti(a). Use of MTI does not change the average S/N of 
targets that are broadly distributed in velocity, but nevertheless introduces a 
requirement for greater signal input that increases the detectability factor Dx. 
Passage of noise through an x-pulse MTI canceler introduces partial correla-
tion over x successive outputs [19]. This reduces from n to an the number of 
independent noise samples available for integration in subsequent processing, 
where

(10.36) 
 An MTI system in which the signals are downconverted to baseband for pro-
cessing is best implemented with two parallel cancelers for the in-phase (I-
channel) and quadrature (Q-channel) components. If the quadrature canceler 
channel is not included, there is a further reduction factor of two in the num-

 Blind-phase loss Lmti(b). Use of only the in-phase bipolar video leads to rejec-
tion of the quadrature components of both noise and signal. The effect on in-
tegration is given by (10.37), but there is also an increase in target fluctuation 
loss. The Rayleigh target, having a chi-square distribution with 2K = 2 de-
grees of freedom, is converted to a Gaussian target (K = 1). The fluctuation 
loss is not significantly increased if the target changes phase sufficiently to 
appear at full amplitude in the I channel output at some time during to. How-
ever, in a batch-processed system where there is only one output sample, the 
fluctuation loss (in decibels) for a target with 2Kne degrees of freedom is 
doubled:

 Velocity response loss Lmti(c). The S/N ratio remains the same in passage 
through the canceler system, when averaged over all target velocities, but in-
dividual targets lying near the response null may be canceled or significantly 
suppressed by the MTI. This is a statistical loss, calculated as shown in Sec-
tion 10.2.5. The resulting loss is shown in Figure 10.12 as a function of detec-
tion probability, and is defined as the increase in input signal required to 
maintain the detection probability. Because of the high value of this loss at 
high Pd, PRF stagger or diversity is almost always used.

10.2.5.6 Pulsed Doppler Losses 
Several losses appearing in pulsed Doppler processors are discussed below. 
 Doppler filter matching loss Lmf. This is the loss relative to a filter matched to 
the envelope of the input pulse train received during the coherent integration 
time tf. It depends on the weighting applied during tf to obtain the desired fil-
ter sidelobes. The filter performance for a given sidelobe level can be found 
using the curves of Figure 10.7, replacing the pulsewidth factor with a filter 
bandwidth factor, and calculating the loss from the plotted values of efficien-
cy as

 Range gate matching loss Lm. When a range gate of width g is used at the in-
put to the Doppler filters, the combined response of this gate and the preced-
ing IF filter should match the transmitted pulse. If a wideband IF is used with 
a rectangular gate, the range gate loss is

If a short sampling strobe is used in place of the range gate, Lm is determined 
by the preceding IF filter, as with other types of radar. 
 Velocity response loss Lvr for pulsed Doppler. Section 9.6.4 discussed the 
fraction of target velocities within the blind speed of the waveform in which 
the response of a Doppler filter bank falls below 6 dB relative to response 
within the passband. In low- and medium-PRF radar, where target velocities 
may exceed the blind speed, PRF diversity is used to fill these regions of in-
adequate response, in order to preserve detection performance on targets that 
are aliased to within v/2 of the mean clutter velocity. In general, two or 
three PRFs are needed to fill all such regions out to the maximum target ve-
locity. Detection performance is reduced at velocities where response is inad-
equate at one or more frequencies. The input signal energy ratio must be in-
creased sufficiently to obtain the desired average Pd for targets distributed 
over the specified velocity region, and that increase is the velocity response 
loss. There is no general formula that expresses the velocity response loss, 
but the eclipsing-loss curves of Figure 10.4 also represent velocity response

loss as a function of detection probability if duty cycle Du is replaced by the 
fraction of velocities having filter response less than 6 dB. 
 Transient gating loss. When the coherent processing interval tf includes nf fill 
pulses to establish steady-state clutter inputs on clutter beyond the unambigu-
ous range, the processor must gate out those pulses to remove the initial tran-
sient before passing inputs to the Doppler filter. The transient gating loss re-
flects the resulting loss of input energy relative to nc pulses transmitted during 
the CPI:

10.2.5.7 Straddling Losses 
Whether electronic processing is carried out in analog or digital form, the four-
dimensional radar space is sampled at discrete points rather than continuously. 
Unless these points are spaced within a fraction of the resolution cell, the SNR on 
targets that are displaced from the nearest sample point will be reduced at the pro-
cessor output.  
 Range straddling loss Ler. Range gates or strobes are usually spaced by ap-
proximately , but a signal having a peak that arrives other than at the strobe 
or the center of the gate is passed with reduced amplitude. The amount of 
straddling loss depends on the pulse shape and gate duration as well as on the 
spacing. For rectangular pulses passed through a rectangular IF filter, the loss 
is shown in Figure 10.13 as a function of the spacing of a narrow strobe.

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
 Filter straddling loss Lef. Signals may also be centered at frequencies between 
the Doppler filters, introducing a filter straddling loss. When heavily 
weighted filters are used, they overlap within the 3-dB points, making this 
loss insignificant, as shown in Figure 10.14. 
 Angle Straddling Loss Lea. The beamshape loss accounts for the sampling in 
angle space by the scanning antenna beam. However, if the antenna scans 
continuously and integration or coherent processing is carried out in a single 
batch rather than continuously, the center of the batch may not coincide with 
the angle of the target. As a result, the peak of the echo envelope may strad-
dle two processing intervals, introducing an angle straddling loss. This loss is 
absent if, for example, a moving-window integrator is used rather than a 
batch process or pulsed Doppler coherent process. Division of the observation 
time into two or more batch processing intervals reduces straddling loss to a 
negligible level, but reduces the integration gain unless the batch outputs are 
subsequently integrated in a moving-window process. Overlapping pro-
cessing batches may also be used, but if the processing is coherent this pre-
cludes burst-to-burst PRF or RF agility. 
10.2.6 
Losses in Clutter Detectability Factor 
In Chapter 3 it was shown that the interference spectral density C0 contributed by 
clutter required adjustment before adding it to the density N0 of white Gaussian 
noise to form the total interference density. The two factors discussed here are 
applied to calculate the clutter detectability factor Dxc used in that adjustment.

For example, if clutter remains correlated over the entire integration time, the up-
ward adjustment in effective clutter spectral density is equal to the integration gain 
available on thermal noise. 
10.2.6.2 Clutter Distribution Loss Lcd 
Land clutter observed beyond the near region (see Figure 9.1) develops an ampli-
tude distribution broader than the Rayleigh distribution, usually described by 
Weibull or lognormal models. The result is either an increase in false-alarm prob-
ability as the clutter peaks pass a threshold set for Rayleigh clutter with the same 
average value, or an increase in threshold that reduces detection probability on 
targets. Sea clutter also tends toward a Weibull or other spread distribution at low 
grazing angles in high-resolution radar. 
A range-cell-averaging CFAR detector (Figure 10.9) is often used, based on 
the assumption of Rayleigh-distributed interference. With a large enough number 
of reference cells, it sets the threshold power, normalized to unity noise power, at 
a level given by (4.15):

for clutter with aw = 1.5, and to 0.05 for aw = 2. In an overland search area con-
taining 105 resolution cells, there would be 5,000 false alarms from land clutter in 
the latter case. While a human observer might be able to ignore these and detect 
targets in relatively clear regions of the display, effective measures to control false 
alarms are essential in any system using electronic detection. 
An approach used with MTI in many radars is to precede the canceler with a 
limiter that is adjusted to restrict the input to a level above noise equal to the MTI 
improvement factor. The large peaks of Weibull or lognormal clutter are then

suppressed by the MTI, but at the expense of spectral spreading that significantly 
reduces the available improvement factor, typically to near 20 dB [20]. In addi-
tion, signals that overlap these peaks are suppressed by the limiting action. The 
false-alarm probability is controlled, but at the expense of reduced detection prob-
ability in regions of heavy clutter. The performance is acceptable in most cases, 
because targets moving between the clutter peaks become visible even with the 
reduced improvement factor, providing interclutter visibility [21]. 
A two-parameter CFAR has been proposed as another possible measure [22]. 
In this system, samples in reference cells are used to estimate both the mean and 
variance of the clutter, and the mean is multiplied by a constant times the variance 
to establish the threshold When a two-parameter CFAR detector is used to adjust 
the threshold for non-Rayleigh clutter, the clutter distribution loss given by (3.8) 
for Weibull-distributed clutter is as shown in Figure 10.16. 
For a lognormal clutter model, the loss can be approximated by using in 
(10.46) or Figure 10.16 an equivalent Weibull spread given by

Figure 10.16 shows the clutter distribution loss of the two-parameter CFAR detec-
tor. It is clear that use of this approach will introduce a large loss in regions where 
aw > 1. 
10.2.6.3 Clutter Map Loss Lmap 
The clutter map is an alternative to limiting or two-parameter CFAR to reduce 
false alarms from the clutter peaks discussed in Section 9.6.5. The clutter map sets 
a threshold based on a long-term average for each map resolution cell taken over 
several successive search scans. It is effective against discrete clutter sources to 
which the range-cell-averaging CFAR detector would be relatively insensitive. 
The clutter map is characterized not by the loss in output SNR, such as im-
posed by a two-parameter CFAR detector over all resolution cells, but rather by a 
reduction in detection probability in those map cells containing significant clutter. 
Applying (3.2) and (3.10), the clutter improvement factor Im provided by MTI or 
other Doppler processing reduces the average interference-to-noise ratio to

where the approximation assumes that the output residue of the Doppler processor 
is uncorrelated (Lcd 1).  
The performance of an idealized clutter map, in which each map cell corre-
sponds to a radar resolution cell, can be modeled by assuming that the gain ap-
plied to signals within a map cell varies inversely with I0/N0:

Figure 10.17 shows the clutter map loss as a function of required detection proba-
bility for a Case 1 target in several clutter environments. For example, assume that 
Im = 40 dB, and that the average input clutter-to-noise energy ratio is C0/N0 = +30 
dB, giving c 10 dB = 0.1. The dashed curves in Figure 10.17 show that Pdav = 
80% can be achieved with a map loss of only 0.41 dB for Rayleigh  clutter (aw = 
1), with the loss rising to 1.6 dB for aw = 3 and to 3.8 dB for aw = 5. A detection 
probability of 90% incurs only 0.42 dB of map loss for Rayleigh clutter, but 1.9 
db for aw = 3 and  7 dB for aw = 5. These losses are much smaller than for other

methods of false-alarm control. The map also has two other advantages: it sup-
ports linear operation of all circuits preceding the MTI or Doppler filter, permit-
ting those circuits to achieve their theoretical improvement factors (see Section 
9.6, and when used to select MTI or normal video processing it permits detection 
of targets with zero radial velocity in cells without clutter, since it can select the 
processing path in response to the actual levels of clutter in each cell.

LOSSES IN VISUAL DETECTION 
Operator detection based on a display is a purely analog process, although the 
information presented may be reconstituted digitally and passed at a high refresh 
rate to the display rather than relying on persistence of the phosphor to retain the 
displayed image. However the display is refreshed, the factors below apply when 
the detection threshold is human rather than electronic. 
10.3.1 
Losses in the Visibility Factor 
The visibility factor V0(50) for a PPI display was discussed in Section 4.6 and plot-
ted in Figure 4.13 for Pd = 50%, as a function of the number of pulses n exchanged 
with the target per beamwidth, under “optimum viewing conditions.” The test 
signal used in developing V0 was of constant amplitude. 
If A comparison of V0(50) with the values of D0(50) for electronic detection, for 
n = 1 and n = 10 is shown in Table 10.5, with values for false-alarm probabilities 
of 104 and 106, since the visual detection process might have provided perfor-
mance within that range.

The average visual detection loss is 2.1 dB over the four listed cases. It would be 
2.9 dB if Pfa were 104 for the visual process, or 1.3 dB if Pfa were 106. There 
appear to be no data to determine which estimate is more nearly correct.

10.3.2 
Collapsing Loss on the Display 
The typical PPI display for visual detection in a medium-range surveillance radar 
presents pulses of  3 s width out to a range of 300 km, corresponding to 2,000 
s of delay. The radius of the display corresponds to 670 range cells. The PPI dis-
plays used in World War II had approximately 200 resolvable spots in the radius 
of the PPI, resulting in a collapsing ratio   3. While the beamwidth is normally 
wider than the angular resolution on the PPI at full range, there is also collapsing 
in angle for mid- and short-range targets. The collapsing ratio increases for shorter 
pulses, and the limited resolution of the human eye can add further collapsing. 
These losses explain at least part of the excess loss in the visibility factor. 
10.3.3 
Bandwidth Correction Factor Cb 
The bandwidth correction factor, expressed by (1.17), adjusts for the loss in target 
visibility resulting from departure from the optimum IF bandwidth Bn = 1.2/. The 
visibility factor, over a broad region near that value, remains close to the value for 
the optimum bandwidth, where it is  1.3–2.9 dB higher than the value for elec-
tronic threshold detection. 
10.3.4 
Operator Loss Lo 
Discrepancies between expected and achieved detection ranges in operational sys-
tems have often been attributed to the ill-defined operator loss. Blake [9, p. 370] 
states that 
The operator loss tends in practice to become an arbitrary factor to account for observed dis-
crepancies between computer and observed radar performance; and while in some cases it 
may be a valid explanation, in others it may be misused to conceal ignorance to why a radar’s 
actual performance is less than that predicted by calculations. In any case it is too vague a 
concept to employ in a range calculation aimed at evaluating the merit of a particular radar 
design or for other engineering purposes. 
The large number of losses listed in this chapter, many of which are uncertain 
even when the attempt is made to produce a complete loss budget, are a more like-
ly explanation of the reduced performance actually observed in tests. 
There are certainly physical and psychological problems that can reduce op-
erator performance relative to the V0 curves used to characterize what is expected 
under optimum conditions. Distractions from the observing task or absence of the 
operator from the display position reduce detection probability to zero over some 
periods. However, other than the few decibels excess in V0 as compared to D0, the 
use of an operator loss should be avoided in radar performance analysis.

10.4 
SUMMARY OF LOSS FACTORS 
This chapter has presented an inventory of the losses that must be included in 
some form in the radar equation to provide accurate performance predictions. 
Some of these are specifically called out in the equation, while others are embed-
ded in other terms. Some are constant regardless of operating conditions and de-
sired performance, while others depend on the environment and the target location 
in range and angles relative to the radar (and to the orientation of the face of an 
electronically scanned array). Still others are function of the detection probability 
desired, increasing steeply as Pd  1. 
Procedures for calculation of most of these losses have been offered and 
curves provided showing typical values. In other cases, analysis of the specific 
design details of the radar and its signal processor, lying beyond the scope of this 
general discussion, are necessary. While the number of factors to be considered in 
loss assessment is large, it is hoped that the material presented will be useful in 
improving the accuracy and consistency of radar range performance analysis. 
It is important in analysis, design, and operation of modern, software-
controlled radar systems to account accurately for the variation of system loss 
with search and target acquisition strategy. For example, beamshape loss is re-
duced by close spacing of beam positions, at the expense of allocating more 
transmitter energy and radar time to search of a given sector. Scanning the volume 
repeatedly, with lower Pd per scan and increased beam spacing, may require less 
total energy and time than performing a single scan with high Pd, especially for 
fluctuating targets. The optimum strategy requires careful balance between the 
beamshape losses discussed in Chapter 5 and statistical losses discussed in this 
chapter. Signal processing losses can be reduced by more dense sampling of 
range-Doppler space to avoid straddling loss. Unlike beamshape loss from sam-
pling in the two angle coordinates, this does not involve increasing transmitted 
energy or search time, requiring only greater processing throughput and memory. 
The cost (in hardware acquisition, size, weight, and power drain) of such over-
sampling decreases as Moore’s law reduces the required digital hardware. 
An area that has not been explored is the potential to oversample in angle 
space, without increasing energy and dwell time, by using multiple offset receiv-
ing beams surrounding the transmitting beam. In modern array radars this is pos-
sible with minimal added hardware by combining the monopulse sum and differ-
ence receiver outputs to form the offset beams. Parallel processors for the multiple 
beams are required for this mode of operation, but as the cost of the array and 
transmitter increase relative to receivers and processing, this may prove a more 
economical solution than scheduling closely spaced transmitting beams.  
A careful study of losses is essential if the radar design is to permit efficient 
use of the increasingly expensive energy and time of these modern systems. If the

detailed loss analysis of this chapter provides the basis for such studies, one objec-
tive of this book will have been achieved.

Contents of DVD 
The DVD in the back of this book contains Mathcad worksheets that apply the 
equations from the text to problems commonly encountered in using the radar 
equation. Printouts of each worksheet are also included in PDF format to permit 
readers without the Mathcad program to review the calculation procedures and 
generate worksheets in the language used by other mathematical programs. 
The worksheets were written in Mathcad 11, and should run also on subse-
quent versions of that program. The filenames are listed here by the chapter to 
which they relate. Methods of calculation and results obtained are summarized. 
Worksheets for Chapter 1 
1-1 Revised Blake Chart.mcd 
The Blake chart provides a convenient method for calculating radar detection 
range and recording the parameters used in the calculation. This worksheet im-
plements Blake’s procedure, as revised and shown in Figure 1.2 of the book. It 
requires separate calculations of the pattern-propagation factor, detectability factor 
and several loss terms that are inserted in the worksheet as user inputs. It includes 
subroutines for calculation of the sky temperature and atmospheric attenuation 
(including lens loss and the effect of any specified rain). The two-step iterative 
procedure for applying these attenuation terms is implemented automatically in 
the worksheet.  
1-2 Range in Thermal Noise.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the maximum detection range of a radar when thermal 
noise is the only source of interference. Propagation conditions may depart the 
simplified assumptions inherent in the Blake chart, and may include attenuation 
from rain. Detection range is calculated for either of two types of target trajectory: 
constant target elevation, or constant target altitude. In addition to the parameters 
entered in the Blake chart, the user enters data for other radar parameters such as 
the elevation beamwidth and local surface conditions, rain rate and extent. Effects 
of clutter are not included (see Worksheet 3-1).

Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
1-3 Required Pd.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the probabilities of track initiation and retention for a 
track-while-scan system, as functions of the scan number for different values of 
single-scan Pd. The criterion for track initiation is detection on two out of three 
scans following the initial detection. The criterion for dropping tracks is either two 
or three consecutive missed detections. The worksheet was used to generate Fig-
ures 1.7 and 1.8 of the book.

Worksheets for Chapter 3 
3-1 Range in Interference.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the maximum detection range of a radar, starting with 
benign conditions in which the propagation conditions may depart the simplified 
assumptions inherent in the Blake chart. Calculations are extended to environ-
ments with noise jamming and clutter, for which user inputs include propagation, 
clutter, jamming, and radar parameters that determine the effects of interference. 
Options are provided to permit skipping calculations for each jamming and clutter 
source to save computing time. 
3-2 CW and HPRF PD Range.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the clutter input energy and detection range of surface-
based CW and HPRF PD radars, considering surface and volume clutter, as dis-
cussed in Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4.6 of the book. The equations generate Figures 3.3, 
3.4, 3.5, 3.8, and 3.9 of the book.

3-3 Jamming.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the effects of noise jamming on radar interference level, 
and the requirements on repeater jammers operating in both mainlobe and 
sidelobe regions. 
Worksheets for Chapter 4 
4-1 Detectability Factor.mcd 
The detectability factor is defined as the input signal-to-noise energy ratio re-
quired to obtain specified probabilities of detection Pd and false alarm Pfa for a 
given number n of pulses integrated on a specified target type. This worksheet 
calculates the basic detectability factor (excluding matching, beamshape, and 
“miscellaneous signal processing losses” that are covered by Worksheet 10-1) as a 
function of Pd, Pfa, n, and target type, for single pulses and for video 
(noncoherent) integration, and the detection probability for specified input snr, Pfa, 
n and target type with and without integration. The target types include steady, 
Swerling Cases 1–4, and a generalized target providing ne independent samples 
during the integration period. Curves of integration and fluctuation loss are also 
generated, as shown in Figures 4.9 and 4.10 of the book. 
Worksheets for Chapter 5 
5-1 Beamshape 1-D.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the beamshape loss for one-dimensional scanning when 
the number of pulses per beamwidth is  1.5. The loss is defined as the increase in 
on-axis SNR required to maintain a given probability of detection. The reference 
for loss is the detectability factor for integration of the signal energy received dur-
ing scan through one beamwidth with the on-axis antenna gain. Results are ob-
tained here for both the case of constant energy per dwell is used (total energy for 
the scan increases as beams are overlapped) and of constant energy per scan, using 
either video integration or cumulative probability over the available samples. Two 
antenna tapers are considered: a Gaussian and a cosine illumination of a rectangu-
lar aperture. Steady and fluctuating targets are considered, and for the latter the 
signal can be correlated (Case 1) or uncorrelated (Case 2) from dwell to dwell. 
5-2 Beamshape 2-D Steady.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the beamshape loss on a steady target for one-
dimensional scanning when the number of pulses per beamwidth is  1.5. The 
reference for loss is the detectability factor that would apply using the on-axis 
antenna gain over the time required to scan one beamwidth. Results are obtained 
for two cases: constant energy per dwell, in which the total energy for the scan 
increases as beams are overlapped, and constant energy per scan, in which the 

414 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
energy per dwell is reduced as beams are overlapped. The beam pattern for cosine 
illumination is used. 
5-3 Beamshape 2-D Case 1.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-2 but for the Swerling Case 
1 target. 
5-4 Beamshape 2-D Case 2.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-2 but for the Swerling Case 
2 target. 
5-5 Beamshape 2-D Diversity.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-2 but for the a target that is 
correlated over each scan line but decorrelated from line to line. 
5-6 Beamshape Triangle Steady.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-2 but for the 2-D raster 
scan using a triangular grid of beam positions.  
5-7 Beamshape Triangle Case 1.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-3 but for the 2-D raster 
scan using a triangular grid of beam positions.  
5-8 Beamshape Triangle Case 2.mcd

scan using a triangular grid of beam positions.  
5-9 Beamshape Triangle Diversity.mcd 
This worksheet performs the same calculations as in 5-5 but for the 2-D raster 
scan using a triangular grid of beam positions.  
Worksheets for Chapter 6 
6-1 Noise Temperature.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the system input noise temperature of a radar with a 
narrow beam directed at a specified elevation angle. Effect of rain attenuation on 
sky temperature is not included, but a separate calculation for that is included in 
Worksheet 7-6. 
6-2 Sky Temperature.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the sky noise temperature for a narrow beam directed at 
a specified elevation angle, and plots results as a function of frequency for select-

 
Contents of DVD 
415 
ed beam angles, as in Figure 6.6 of the book. Effect of rain attenuation is not in-
cluded. Sky temperature for specific conditions may be found by entering those 
conditions at the end of the worksheet. 
6-3 Cascaded Receiver Stages.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the receiver noise temperature Te for a multistage re-
ceiver, with input parameters and output data as shown in Table 6.2 of the book. 
Worksheets for Chapter 7 
7-1 Standard Atmosphere.mcd 
This worksheet stores the parameters of the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere up to 
30 km altitude for use in radar propagation worksheets. Analytical approximations 
are given for temperature, pressure, water-vapor density, and refractivity as func-
tions of altitude. Parameters of the CRPL exponential reference atmospheres are 
listed, and the effective Earth’s radius constant is derived for each of these mod-
els. 
7-2 Attenuation and Noise.mcd 
This worksheet generates a table of tropospheric attenuation coefficients and cre-
ates continuous functions by interpolation. The atmosphere model from worksheet 
7-1 is used to calculate the refractive index profile for ray-tracing and to scale the 
attenuation coefficients to temperature and density of oxygen and water vapor as a 
function of altitude. These data are used to calculate the tropospheric attenuation 
as a function of range at specified elevation angles and radar frequencies, and to 
generate plots for Chapter 7.  
7-3 Attenuation at Frequency F.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the tropospheric attenuation as a function of range for a 
specified frequency F and beam elevation angle b, using expressions from the 
worksheet 7-2 that are modified to run more rapidly for the specified frequency. 
7-4 Weather Attenuation.mcd 
This worksheet applies expressions for rain attenuation derived by Blake, and 
combines these with a temperature correction factor from referenced sources to 
obtain attenuation coefficients for arbitrary temperature. Attenuation coefficients 
for snow and clouds are also calculated.  
7-5 Lens Factor.mcd 
The lens factor F 2
lens is the reciprocal of the two-way lens loss as defined by Weil, 
who provided plots of lens loss as a function of target range and elevation angle of 
the beam at the radar site. This worksheet calculates the lens loss and reproduces 

416 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
Weil’s plot. The method of solution is to use Blake’s ray-tracing formula to find 
the pathlength of the ray that reaches a target at a given altitude above the Earth’s 
surface. Two root-finding equations are then applied, the first finding the ray an-
gle as a function of the target’s range and true elevation, and second finding the 
true target elevation as a function of its range, as required to produce the plot for 
specific beam elevation angles. The two-way lens loss is given by the square of 
the ratio of a small increment of true target elevation to the corresponding change 
in beam angle at the radar. This ratio represents the spreading of energy in the 
beam as it travels through the refracting atmosphere. The lens factor 20log(Flens) 
in dB is the negative of the lens loss in dB. 
7-6 Total Loss at Frequency F.mcd 
This worksheet calculates, for a specified frequency and elevation angle, the trop-
ospheric absorption, lens loss, and weather attenuation as functions of range. The 
corresponding components of sky noise are also calculated. 
7-7 Ionosphere.mcd 
This worksheet performs calculations on ionospheric effects used in the radar 
equation: Faraday rotation loss and dispersion loss. The electron densities of the 
Chapman layers are modeled as in Figure 7.31 of the book. The total electron den-
sity as a function of a path to a specified altitude at specified elevation angle is 
calculated by integration to generate Figure 7.32. The corresponding Faraday rota-
tion is calculated for f0 = 100 MHz as a function of altitude (Figure 7.33), and for 
paths through the ionosphere as a function of frequency in daytime and nighttime 
at elevation angles of 0 and 90 (Figure 7.34). From these data, the Faraday rota-
tion losses, both as the average over the total rotation angle and as a statistical loss 
in reaching a specified Pd, are found (Figures 7.35 and 10.5). The loss from dis-
persion over the signal spectrum (Figures 7.36–7.39) is also found. 
Worksheets for Chapter 8 
8-1 Propagation Factor.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the propagation factor, including the reflected interfer-
ence and diffraction factors, as a function of target range and height. In order to 
produce smooth plots in a minimum computation time, the range and target height 
are varied in logarithmic steps between specified minimum and maximum values. 
The factor for a specific target location is calculated. 
8-2 Reflection Coefficient 
This worksheet calculates and plots the reflection coefficient as a function of graz-
ing angle, for a specified surface and wavelength, including its three components: 
(1) the Fresnel reflection coefficient for vertical and horizontal polarizations; (2) 

 
Contents of DVD 
417 
the specular scattering factor; and (3) the vegetation factor. The Fresnel coeffi-
cient is calculated using the Saxton and Lane expressions for dielectric constant of 
sea water and user inputs for land surfaces. The specular scattering factor is given 
by (8.57) in the book. The vegetation factor is calculated using the empirical mod-
el developed by Barton for use in Modern Radar System Analysis Software, Ver-
sion 3, and given by (8.61) in the book. 
Worksheets for Chapter 9 
9-1 Surface Clutter 
This worksheet calculates the reflectivity, propagation factor, and spectral pa-
rameters of land and sea clutter, as described in Sections 9.1–9.4 of the book. 
Plots of the propagation factor (Figures 9.2 and 9.3 in the book) are generated, as 
well as the empirical relationship of Weibull and lognormal spread parameters to 
propagation factor (Figure 9.4) and the products 0Fc
4 of Figures 9.5 and 9.8. 
9-2 Volume Clutter 
This worksheet calculates the reflectivity, propagation factor, and spectral pa-
rameters of rain and sea clutter, as described in Sections 9.5 of this book. Rain, 
snow, and cloud reflectivities are calculated using data from Battan’s Radar Ob-
servation of the Atmosphere and Sauvageot’s Radar Meteorology.  
9-3 Clutter Improvement Factor 
This worksheet calculates the clutter improvement factors of coherent and 
noncoherent MTI and pulsed Doppler processors. User inputs include the spectral 
parameters of the clutter, the radar waveform, and the parameters of the signal 
processor. 
Worksheet for Chapter 10 
10-1 Loss Factors.mcd 
This worksheet calculates the losses that enter into the radar equation that are not 
specific subjects of other worksheets (e.g., atmospheric attenuation and 
beamshape loss). Losses are considered under five headings: 
1. Those that reduce received signal energy: RF line loss and RF mismatch 
loss, polarization factor, and components of the range-dependent re-
sponse factor (STC factor, beam-dwell factor, eclipsing factor), scan and 
scan-sector losses.  
2. Losses in the search radar equation: elevation beamshape loss, beam-
width factor, aperture efficiency and illumination loss, scan distribution 
loss. 

418 
Radar Equations for Modern Radar 
3. Losses in antenna gain: dimensional tolerances, phase-shifter quantiza-
tion. feed and module phase and amplitude errors. 
4. Filter matching loss, including receiver and  pulse compression. 
5. Signal processing losses: binary integration loss, CFAR loss, collapsing 
loss, MTI and PD processing losses, straddling losses in all coordinates, 
losses in the clutter detectability factor, and clutter map loss. 
Supplemental Worksheets 
For the convenience of users of Modern Radar System Analysis Software, Version 
3.0, modified worksheets for several segments of that software are provided. The-
se replace the corresponding worksheets that the user has already installed from 
Version 3.0, but the remainder of those worksheets are still required to perform 
the radar system analysis. The modifications include corrections and additions to

About the Author 
David K. Barton is a radar system consultant, 
with a home and office in Hanover, New 
Hampshire. He attended Harvard College from 
1944 to 1949, with a two-year interruption for 
service in the U.S. Army at White Sands Prov-
ing Grounds. He returned to White Sands as a 
civilian engineer after receiving his A.B. in 
physics in 1949. In 1953, Mr. Barton trans-
ferred to the Signal Corps Laboratories at Fort 
Monmouth, New Jersey, to initiate develop-
ment of the AN/FPS-16, the first monopulse 
instrumentation radar. In 1955, he joined the 
staff at RCA, where the radar development was 
carried out, and participated in the test and 
evaluation of the system. For this work RCA 
awarded him in 1958 the first David W. 
Sarnoff Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering. Mr. Barton also 
scaled up that radar to create in 1960 the AN/FPS-49 radars for the Ballistic Mis-
sile Early Warning System, only recently replaced after 40 years of operation in 
Alaska and Great Britain. 
From 1963 to 1984 he was a consulting scientist with Raytheon Company in 
Wayland and Bedford, Massachusetts, where he originated the radar concepts for 
the AN/TPS-19 radar-controlled landing system for the U.S. Air Force, and con-
tributed to a number of other radar and guided missile studies and projects. He 
joined ANRO Engineering in 1984, engaging in radar and missile system studies 
until his retirement in 2004.  
Mr. Barton was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 1972 and to the National 
Academy of Engineering in 1997. In 2002, he received the IEEE Dennis J. Picard 
Medal for Radar Technologies and Applications. He has served on the scientific 
advisory boards of the U.S. Air Force, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the 
Army Research Laboratories. Since 1975 he has been the editor of the Artech 
House Radar Series, of which this book is approximately the 165th volume.
