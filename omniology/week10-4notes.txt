FLUID & ELECTROLYTE BALANCE 
Over the course of a day, we ingest about 2 liters of food and drink that contains varying amounts 
of ions and solutes. To maintain mass balance, what comes in and is not used must be excreted.  
Two of the major functions of the renal system are to maintain fluid volumes of the body by 
regulating Na+ and to maintain the osmolarity of the body by regulating water. Adjustments 
made by the kidney are slow (over hours) because they are mediated by hormones.

MEDULLARY GRADIENT   
The kidney can conserve water but cannot replenish lost water. Of the water lost by the body 
due to evaporation of sweat, breathing, and metabolism, only water which is excreted by the 
kidney can be regulated. When water is conserved, the urine becomes concentrated up to 1200 
mOsM (blood is 300 mOsM).  
 
Conservation of water is regulated by the peptide hormone, vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, 
ADH), which is secreted by the posterior pituitary.  When the body needs to eliminate excess 
water, copious amounts of dilute urine are made with an osmolarity as low as 50 mOsM. This is 
called diuresis. Drugs that cause diuresis are called diuretics. 
 
The kidneys control the concentration of urine by varying the reabsorption of water in the distal 
regions of the renal tubule. Here water moves across the tubular epithelial cells by osmosis. 
Recall that osmosis will not take place unless a concentration gradient for water exists. Within the 
kidney medulla, there exists a standing osmotic gradient (due to Na+ and urea) within the 
interstitial space (ISF) of 300-1200 mOsM. This gradient is established and maintained by 
nephrons, called the juxtamedullary nephrons which are located near the cortex-medulla 
boundary. The renal tubule of these nephrons, unlike the cortical nephrons, extend deep within 
the medulla. Both the loop of Henle and urea transporters located in the collecting ducts (CD) of 
the juxtamedullary nephrons contribute to the osmotic gradient within the medulla.

How does this work? In the medulla, the epithelial cells lining the renal tubule have selective 
permeability to water and ions (Fig 1). In the descending loop of Henle, the epithelial cells are 
impermeable to Na+ but permeable to water. This means that as the filtrate flows through the 
descending thin loop of Henle, it becomes progressively more hyperosmotic. Ultimately, at the 
bottom of the loop deep in the medulla, the loop filtrate reaches 1200 mOsM.  
 
In contrast, in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TAL), the epithelial cells are permeable to 
ions and impermeable to water. Here Na+, K+, and Cl- are reabsorbed (Na-K-2Cl, 2nd active 
transport) from the renal tubule, but water from the tubule cannot follow (Fig 1) due to the 
absence of aquaporin in the luminal surface of the epithelial cells. Because the epithelial cells of 
the TAL are NOT permeable to water, the tubular filtrate becomes hyposmotic (100mOsM) as it 
flows towards the cortex-medullary boundary. This filtrate will be dilute urine, if water is not 
reabsorbed in either the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct (CD).   
 
To prevent “washing out” of the standing osmotic gradient in the medulla, the blood in the 
capillary flows opposite to the flow of filtrate in the tubule (i.e., counter- current manner) (Fig 1).  
 
 
Figure 1. Schematic of the renal tubule shows the medullary gradient (300-1200 mOsM) versus the 
isosmotic state of the cortex (300mOsM). As water leaves the descending loop of Henle, it is removed by 
the capillary (red line). Flow within the capillary is opposite to that in the tubule (counter current). Note 
that the capillary “gains” Na+ on its downward path (right side of its loop) and “gains” water (left side of 
the loop) as it returns to the cortex.  
 
HORMONES & URINE CONCENTRATION  
In the DCT and CD, the osmolarity and ionic content of the urine can be altered. This is regulated 
by two hormones: antidiuretic (DH, vasopressin) and aldosterone. 
 
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) acts on the CD epithelial cells in the kidney medulla to increase 
their permeability to water. Recall that ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to 
either increased plasma osmolarity or a large decrease in plasma volume. Within the CD, 
activation of the ADH receptor results in the insertion of aquaporin 2 channels into the luminal 
plasma membrane. In the presence of the aquaporin 2 channels, water moves from the filtrate 
(urine) to the blood. The end result is more a concentrated urine and increased blood pressure.  In 
the absence of ADH, this tubule is impermeable to water and 18 L/day of urine is excreted 
(Table 1).

Vasopressin also increases facilitated transport of urea across the CD epithelial cells. Urea, a 
byproduct of protein metabolism, must be excreted by the kidney but it is also used to generate in 
part the osmotic gradient in the inner medulla. Urea transporters are located in the CD and within 
cells lining the thin loop of Henle and the medullary capillaries, as well as in red blood cells. 
These transporters enable rapid equilibration of urea preventing cell shrinkage in the inner (deep) 
medulla.  
 
Aldosterone regulates the movement of water and Na+ across the CD epithelial cells.   
The adrenal gland secretes aldosterone in response to either elevated plasma K+ or angiotensin II 
(see below). Aldosterone increases the expression of the Na+ and K+ channels on the luminal 
surface of the CD epithelial cells and the number of Na+-K+ ATPases in the basal surface of 
these cells. Consequently, Na+ is reabsorbed from the filtrate and K+ is secreted into the renal 
tubule from the blood. Because water follows Na+, aldosterone concentrates urine, increases the 
volume of the blood and increases blood pressure. Note that aldosterone is not secreted when 
plasma Na+ concentration is high.  
 
Renin - Angiotensin II- Aldosterone System (RAAS) is a third pathway that can alter the 
volume of the urine and blood pressure. This pathway works as follows. Each nephron has an 
osmo- and mechano-sensor, the macula densa, which signals to the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells 
(smooth muscle) of the afferent arteriole to regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  When 
the flow of the filtrate is low in the TAL, the macula densa triggers the JG cells to secrete renin 
into the blood. Renin, an enzyme, activates a cascade of signals in the blood to generate 
angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (Fig 2). Angiotensin II, in turn, increases the secretion of 
aldosterone from the adrenal gland and vasopressin (ADH) from the posterior pituitary.  
 
The RAAS pathway is NOT activated and aldosterone is NOT secreted when the osmolarity of 
the filtrate is high or when the volume of filtrate is high (Fig 3).

CHANGES IN BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS 
Water can be lost from the body by diarrhea, vomiting, and excessive sweating. If sufficient, this 
can lead to volume contraction and alter the size of the major fluid compartments of the body 
(ECF and ICF).  Fluid loss can include:  
 
1.  Loss of isosmotic fluid (i.e., volume depletion) from the ECF which leads to a decrease in 
blood pressure and the disruption of O2 and nutrient delivery to tissues. 
 
 
2.  Loss of hyposmotic water from the ECF which leads to an increase in the omolarity of the 
ECF and a decrease in ICF volume (i.e., cells shrink).    
 
In contrast, when an excess of fluid is ingested, then the ECF volume expands. In this condition 
blood volume is increased. If this increase in blood volume is sufficiently large, it can stretch the 
cardiac muscle cells of the atria. Stretching of the atrial muscle cells releases a hormone called 
atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). ANF relaxes the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of the afferent 
arteriole and thereby increases GFR and urine output. ANF also inhibits the reabsorption of Na+ 
by the renal tubule epithelial cells and thereby increases the loss of water and sodium from the 
body.  
 
DIURESIS & DIURETICS 
Increased urine excretion above 1mL/min is called diuresis. There are several causes including 
the following: 
 
Water diuresis occurs when the osmolarity of the plasma is decreased. This condition inhibits 
secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).    
 
Osmotic diuresis occurs when an osmotically active substance (such as glucose) is present 
within the renal tubule.  
 
Diuretics are drugs that increase loss of body water primarily by inhibiting Na+ reabsorption by 
the renal tubule. Diuretics act at different segments of the renal tubule (Table 2).

KEY CONCEPTS 
1. The kidneys’ primary functions are to maintain fluid volumes of the body by regulating salt 
balance and to maintain the osmolarity of the body by regulating water balance.  
2. Reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes is governed by concentration gradients and 
secondary active transport. 
3.    Healthy people use hormones to regulate osmolarity (ADH), to regulate K+ (aldosterone), 
and to regulate fluid volume (ADH, aldosterone, or ANF).  
4.    Diuresis is the excess loss of body water as urine. Diuresis may be caused by excess total 
body water, presence of osmotically active solutes within the renal tubules, and drugs 
(diuretics) which inhibit the reabsorption of Na+ across the tubular epithelium.
