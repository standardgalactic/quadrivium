About the Author
Tom Price has lived in and written about Washington, D.C., for more
than two decades. As a journalist who focuses on government and poli-
tics, he knows the ins and outs of official Washington. As the parent of 
a college-age Washington native, he’s discovered the best Washington
places for kids of all ages. As a longtime D.C. resident, he’s found fun 
and interesting Washington experiences for adults of all ages as well,
having repeatedly explored the city with his family and visiting friends.
From late 1982 through 1995, Tom was a correspondent in the Cox
Newspapers Washington Bureau. Since then, he has been a freelance
writer whose work has appeared in books, magazines, and newspapers
and on Internet sites. With his wife, Susan Crites Price, Tom is coauthor
of The Working Parents Help Book: Practical Advice for Dealing with the
Day-to-Day Challenges of Kids and Careers, which won a Parents’ Choice
Award, was a Scholastic Book Club selection, and has been featured 
by “Today,” “Oprah,” and other broadcast and print media. His most
recent book, written with former U.S. representative and ambassador
Tony Hall, is Changing the Face of Hunger: One Man’s Story of How
Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, Republicans and People of Faith Are
Joining Forces to Help the Poor, the Hungry and the Oppressed. Tom also is
author of Frommer’s Irreverent Guide to Washington. Previously, Tom, a
Pittsburgh native, reported for newspapers in Pennsylvania and Ohio.


Dedication
For Susan and Julie, who make me happy and proud.

Introduction
W
hen you visit Washington, D.C., you’re visiting the capital of the
world — a city with more power than any other on the planet,
and one filled with world-class tourist attractions as well.
It wasn’t always this way. Almost nothing stood on the sites of the White
House, Capitol, and other current U.S. government buildings when George
Washington selected the spot to become the new nation’s capital city in
1791, primarily because of its central location between the already quar-
relling North and South and its nearness to his beloved home, Mount
Vernon. As recently as the 1960s, critics described Washington as a cul-
tural backwater, a sleepy Southern town, a place without decent restau-
rants where the sidewalks were rolled up at dusk.
Washington has long had its shrines to freedom and its halls of 
government — the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Library 
of Congress, and the other government companions to the White House
and Capitol. But the city now also has many fine restaurants and hotels,
museums, galleries, and performing arts organizations.
Along with New York, Washington was a target of the terrorist attacks 
of September 11, 2001. American Airlines flight 77 was flown into the
Pentagon, across the Potomac River from D.C. in Northern Virginia. United
Airlines flight 93, which crashed in rural Pennsylvania, was believed to
have been destined for the White House or the Capitol. As I write this
book, tours of the White House and Pentagon are given only to select
groups, security has been ratcheted up everywhere, and ugly concrete
barriers block traffic and mar beautiful views throughout the city. But, like
New Yorkers, Washingtonians have been determined to resume normal
activities, which include playing host to many visitors. There is little that
you could have done here on September 10, 2001, that you can’t do today.
I’ve loved Washington since long before I moved here. For a journalist
who focuses on politics and government, there’s no better place to live
and work. Having lived in D.C. for more than 20 years now, I’ve come to
know it as deeply as I love it. I’m thrilled to be able to share that knowl-
edge with you.
About This Book
You probably picked up this particular book because you’re too busy to
wade through an overwhelming mass of information or you aren’t inter-
ested in spending weeks planning a five-day trip. Perhaps you’re a first-
time visitor to Washington, and you don’t know where to begin. Or

maybe you’re frustrated by all the detail in conventional guidebooks.
(You know what I mean: You want to find out when a museum opens,
and the author tells you how to build one.) Armed with Washington, D.C.
For Dummies, 4th Edition, you’ll feel like a capital insider in no time.
Think of this as a reference book. You can read it from cover to cover 
if you like (I’ll be flattered!), but more likely you’ll want to dip into the
chapters or sections that are the most interesting or important to you at
a particular moment. The Table of Contents and Index allow you to find
what you need when you need it — hotels, restaurants, sights, stores,
nightspots, and more.
This book doesn’t overwhelm you with choices, but it does give you
enough information to pick what’s best for you. When money is
involved, you’ll find options at various price levels.
Please note that travel information is subject to change at any time —
and this is especially true of prices. I therefore suggest that you write or
call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors,
editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experiences of
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we
encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a
close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves
and pickpockets.
I’ve offered lots of D.C. travel tips to visiting friends and family over the
last two decades, and that’s exactly what I’m offering you. When you’ve
finished your visit and are heading back home, I expect you’ll have
acquired some of the affection that I feel for this town and that you’ll
want to come back.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you get information quickly, I use some abbreviations and sym-
bols throughout this book. Washington, D.C., is referred to as
“Washington,” “D.C.,” or “the District.” (Its formal name is “Washington,
District of Columbia.”)

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

Reviews of hotels and restaurants are organized alphabetically. Handy
indexes help you locate them quickly by location, price, and cuisine.
Credit cards accepted are listed this way:

The dollar signs that accompany the hotel and restaurant reviews give
you a sense of their prices, as shown in the following table. For a hotel,
the dollar signs represent the average of the lowest and highest undis-
counted rate for a double-occupancy room for one night during high
season. For each restaurant, I’ve averaged the highest and lowest prices
for an appetizer or salad, main course, and dessert at dinner per person,
not including taxes and tips.

In the individual reviews, I give more specific information about costs. I
can’t, of course, tell you about all the special discounts that hotels and
restaurants sometimes offer, but I do mention hotels that often give
especially attractive deals. And prices, as you know, are subject to change,
so it’s a good idea to call ahead to confirm hours and prices and to ask
about special offers and discounts when you make your reservations.
You’ll find three kinds of listings in the hotel section — first reviews of
the best hotels in each price range, then a listing of some runners-up.
Don’t be shy about picking from the second list if you’re unable to get 
a room at one of the best. The runners-up also are fine places to spend
the night. I’ve also compiled a collection of some of the best bed-and-
breakfast accommodations in a wide range of prices. People often 
think B&Bs are found only in small towns or the countryside, but 
they also provide some of the most interesting — and sometimes 
most economical — places to stay in the city, too.
For hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map, a page
reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restaurant, or
attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area, it may
not be mapped.

Foolish Assumptions
I’ve written this book for both the frequent flier and the inexperienced
traveler. The assumptions I’ve made about both (and, truthfully, I hope
they’re not foolish!) are:
 As an inexperienced traveler, you may be trying to determine
whether or not to visit Washington, or you may be looking for help
in deciding when and how to make the trip.
 As an experienced traveler, you don’t want to spend much time
planning your trip, or you don’t have much time to spend in the
city once you arrive. You want quick, expert advice on how to get
the most out of your time and how to enjoy a hassle-free visit.
 Whatever your degree of travel experience, you’re not looking for 
a book that provides every piece of information available about
Washington sights or one that lists every hotel and restaurant in
the city. Instead, you want a book that focuses on the best places to
eat and sleep in all price ranges and the best ways to enjoy your
limited time here.
If you fit any of these criteria, Washington, D.C. For Dummies, 4th Edition,
is the book you’re looking for.
How This Book Is Organized
The Table of Contents at a Glance and complete Table of Contents at the
front of this book are useful tools for finding information quickly. At the
back of the book is an Appendix, which lists helpful service information
and phone numbers, and the index, the most useful tool for navigating
the book. The heart of Washington, D.C. For Dummies, 4th Edition, is
divided into six parts. Within each part are chapters that delve into
specifics. Each chapter is written so that you don’t have to read what
comes before or after it. When necessary, I refer you to other sections of
the book for more information.
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C.
Here’s an overview of Washington and a taste of what you can expect to
encounter when you visit. I’ve compiled a brief list of the best of every-
thing D.C. has to offer, as well as information about the weather, sea-
sons, and special events, to help you decide when you’d like to visit.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C.
What do things cost in Washington? What’s the best way to get here?
This part is where I tell you what you need to know to plan your visit
successfully. I also include information for travelers with special needs
or interests, such as families with kids, people with disabilities, seniors,
and gay and lesbian visitors.

Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C.
Okay, here’s where I really get into the good stuff. Meet D.C.’s best hotels
and restaurants in all price categories. Find out how to get around and
how to get along. Come with me through the city’s most interesting
neighborhoods. Discover the wonders of the underground Metrorail
system.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C.
The sights, of course, are why you’re coming. In Part IV, I tell you what
you want to know about the top sights (and some particularly interest-
ing lesser known attractions) and give you the skinny on tours and shop-
ping. I toss in some itineraries — at no extra charge (you’re welcome) —
as well as suggestions for excursions nearby.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: D.C. Nightlife
This part is where you find out what’s going on after the museums 
close and the government goes to sleep for the night. Washingtonians
may be known as workaholics who think “party” must be preceded by
“Republican” or “Democratic,” but D.C. has a vibrant after-dark scene as
well, from country, rock, and jazz clubs to world-class symphony, dance,
opera, and theater.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Not as famous as the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, perhaps, but the For
Dummies Part of Tens nevertheless is full of cool information. In this
part, you find the best places to view the city’s breathtaking skyline as
well as places that are worth driving to see — the only time driving is
worthwhile in D.C., I should add.
Appendix
At the back of the book is your Quick Concierge, a compendium of
handy information you may need while visiting Washington. In it, I
include phone numbers and addresses for area hospitals and pharma-
cies, tips for finding ATMs, information about where to take a broken
camera or which radio station plays your music, and other useful tips.
Check out this Appendix when searching for answers to the little ques-
tions that may come up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
You find the following icons (little pictures) scattered throughout the
margins of this guide. They call your attention to particular kinds of
information.

home.
This bull’s-eye alerts you to facts, hints, and insider information that can

Where to Go from Here
Now that you know what to expect from this book, you can start to plan
your visit — or, if you’re already in D.C., you can decide what to do right
now. See and do all you can. And have fun. Your tax dollars help to pay
for much of what you’ll encounter here, so go get your money’s worth.

 Finding the best stuff for kids
W
ashington, D.C., is much more than just the home of the United
States government. D.C. offers hotel choices that range from the
ultra-ritzy to the ultra-cheap; restaurants that feature many of the world’s
ethnic cuisines; and rich cultural, historical, scientific, and educational
museums and monuments.
One of Washington’s best selling points is that many of these top attrac-
tions are free. Unlike in London, Paris, Rome, or other major capitals,
you don’t have to open your wallet before you can open the doors to
most of the popular museums, galleries, and other sights. You don’t even
have to open doors to enjoy another pleasant sight — Washington’s
impressive landscape.
The car-free National Mall — lawns, gardens, ponds, and walkways —
stretches from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol and is bordered by
many of the Smithsonian’s facilities. The cherry trees along the tidal
basin are spectacular in the spring.
Whether you’re interested in touring the brick and cobblestone streets
of Georgetown or enjoying the Latin-influenced nightlife in Adams-Morgan,
this chapter shows you the best Washington, D.C., has to offer.
You can find the details on each location or activity later in this guide.
Throughout the book, look for the “Best of the Best” icon to highlight my
very top picks.

The Best Hotels
For more information on the hotels listed, see Chapter 9.
 Best power palaces: If you’ve got money, connections, or both —
or just want to act like you do — try staying at one of these spots
where lobbyists and government officials hang their hats, or just
hang out. You can’t beat the location of the opulent Willard
InterContinental, which has both the White House and D.C.’s city
hall in its sights. That’s why the powerful and those who seek to
influence them have been staying here since the middle of the 19th
century. Across Lafayette Square from the White House, the Hay-
Adams is another favorite among the rich and the politically con-
nected. Less expensive, but close to the Congressional action, the
Capitol Hill Suites counts U.S. representatives among its long-term
residents. Short-term tourist guests get dining privileges at the
Republican Party’s nearby Capitol Hill Club.
 Best charming hotels: Amidst all of Washington’s wealth and pre-
tensions, some accommodations become distinct by daring to be
true to themselves. The Tabard Inn exudes character and charm in
three adjacent town houses on a tree-lined street near Dupont
Circle. It also offers especially low prices in some rooms for guests
willing to share a bathroom down the hall. Exuding upscale charac-
ter and charm, The Jefferson is quiet and elegant and keeps its
guests coming back for its personalized service. The Morrison-
Clark Historic Inn and Restaurant scatters period antiques
throughout two 1864 Victorian Mansions that are listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.
 Best B&Bs: The D.C. Guest House is a 19th-century mansion, reno-
vated to the eclectic taste of its owners who lavish warm attention
on their guests. Equally striking is the 19th-century Swann House.
This luxurious mansion feels just like it must have when its wealthy
occupants lived the lush life in the early 20th century. For the budget-
minded, the Kalorama Guest House at Woodley Park offers clean,
comfortable, and relatively spacious rooms starting at $55 single and
$60 double. The afternoon sherry hour offers a touch of elegance.
 Best suites: Suites with cooking facilities — and sometimes sepa-
rate sleeping quarters — are wonderful for families looking to save
money on meals and to enjoy a little privacy. You get lots of choices
at Georgetown Suites, from a one-room studio to more luxurious
town house and penthouse accommodations. One Washington
Circle also offers a variety of floor plans, from “guest quarters”
with sleeping and sitting areas in one large room to “grand state-
rooms” with separate bedroom, dining area, living area, and one
and a half bathrooms. Most have kitchens and balconies. Business
travelers and families are attracted to The River Inn because of
spacious studios, large one-bedroom suites, and occasional super-
duper deals that drop the $300-plus rack rates to less than $120.
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C.

 Best hotels with international appeal: Because it stands not far
from the State Department, World Bank, Kennedy Center, and
George Washington University, the State Plaza attracts diplomats
and other international travelers bound for those government,
artistic, and educational venues. The location of Irish-owned Jurys
Normandy Inn — near diplomatic facilities in the exclusive Kalo-
rama neighborhood — makes it a popular spot for diplomats and
other international visitors as well. The French own the Sofitel
Lafayette Square and are quite proud of serving up art de vivre —
“the art of French living” — in the hotel’s restaurant food, bar
drinks, gift shop gifts, room décor, and even the staff’s uniforms.
 Best budget digs: Youthful idealists in Washington on a shoestring
and other budget-minded visitors find Hostelling International 
to be a simple but adequate place to spend the night, with rock-
bottom prices for dormitory-style rooms. For families and cost-
conscious touring groups, the centrally located Hotel Harrington
provides large rooms and suites starting at $99. The low-cost Red
Roof Inn chain operates an urban version of its roadside motels
near the Verizon Center, Convention Center, Chinatown, and many
attractions of the fast-growing Penn Quarter entertainment and arts
neighborhood.
The Best Restaurants
For more information on the restaurants listed here, see Chapter 10.
 Best power palaces: So you want to watch James Carville and Mary
Matalin duke it out over dinner? Grab a table at the Palm, where
the famous feast on steak and lobster. Senators and Supreme Court
justices hang out at The Monocle on Capitol Hill. Located near the
White House, the Occidental attracts presidential aides, journal-
ists, and lobbyists. Check out the photos of the powerful and the
famous who have been dining on this site for the last 100 years.
 Best for big spenders: Pretend you’re a member of Congress, for
whom (other people’s) money is no object, and sample the best
Washington food that lots of money can buy. Entrees start at $29
and the tasting menus are $110 to $145 at Le Paradou, an exquisite
contemporary French restaurant that opened in mid-2004. Also
exquisite and French (or “French/Californian,” as Chef Michel
Richard terms it) is Michel Richard Citronelle, where fixed-price
meals range from $85 to $150 and a seat at the chef’s table starts at
$275. Chef Roberto Donna’s private dining room at Galileo, which
he calls Laboratorio, charges atmospheric prices for spectacular
Italian food. All of which makes CityZen’s New American tasting
menus seem like bargains at $75 for three courses and $90 for 
five — plus wine, of course.
Galileo closed for renovations in 2006 and was scheduled to reopen
by fall 2007.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Washington, D.C. 11

 Best for fighting the deficit: In all-American tradition, Luna Grill &
Diner offers old-fashioned blue-plate specials and new age green-
plate specials for vegetarians. Booeymonger, a local deli chain, is
open from breakfast to late in the city, till not quite so late in the
suburbs. Another local chain, Firehook Bakery, offers inventive
sandwiches on its own breads and pours D.C.’s best coffee, locally
roasted Quartermaine.
 Best for debating foreign policy: It’s dreadfully undiplomatic to
pick out a handful of best international restaurants from the zillions
that do business in this very international town. But, here goes:
Montmartre really tastes and feels like France, as does Cafe La
Ruche for a lot fewer francs. Chef Vikram Sunderam terms Rasika’s
cuisine “modern Indian.” It’s superb and probably unlike any other
Indian dishes you’ve come across in the past. Authentic Italian
cooking comes from the kitchen at Obelisk, a small cafe near
Dupont Circle that offers a fixed-price menu with a few wonderful
selections each evening. City Lights of China serves up good
Chinese food in attractive surroundings, while the surroundings at
Eat First are as plain as its name but the food is a joy. For a fun
night out with a group, go sit on the floor and eat with your fingers
at Moroccan Marrakesh.
 Best for inexpensive international fare: You get real Neapolitan
pizza at Pizzeria Paradiso and 2 Amys. To nibble your way through
small plates of various nationalities, try Zaytinya for Mediterranean
meze or Jaleo for Spanish tapas.
 Best for romancing your number-one constituent: In cold weather,
reserve the table nearest the fire in Sea Catch’s front dining room,
where the walls are made of stone and wood paneling and floor-to-
ceiling windows overlook the C&O Canal. Fireside tables also beckon
in 1789 Restaurant, which occupies a 19th-century, Federalist-style
home in Georgetown. In warm weather, dine on the balcony over-
looking the C&O Canal.
 Best for prevoters: Kids as well as grownups cast ballots for 2
Amys and Pizzeria Paradiso. Not only is the food kid-friendly, but
these places are cheerful and noisy. The Tex-Mex Austin Grill
restaurants also are gaily noisy, and — downtown and in the 
suburbs — gaily decorated. The Old Ebbitt Grill draws White
House staff and pleases adult palates, but the large menu also
includes much of interest to children — burgers and finger-food
appetizers, for example. And kids’ wandering attention can be
directed to the hunting trophies and other odd stuff that’s scat-
tered throughout this large restaurant/pub.
The Best Attractions
For more information on the attractions listed here, see Chapter 11
unless otherwise indicated.
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C. 
12

 Best memorial: For me, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial wins
hands-down because of its idyllic setting on the Tidal Basin, its gor-
geous views of cherry trees and other Washington landmarks, its
suggestion of Tom’s home of Monticello, and the inspiring words
engraved around the rotunda. It also helps that Jefferson is my
favorite founding father. The Abraham Lincoln Memorial is a close
runner-up, however, for similar reasons. The view from the top of
the memorial’s steps is a breathtaking sweep of the entire National
Mall to the Capitol dome, Lincoln’s words are engraved on the
walls, and this was the site of many historical events, including
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, “I Have a Dream” speech.
 Best art galleries: The National Gallery of Art is one of the world’s
great art museums, and it keeps getting better. But the top spot in
Washington at this moment has to go to the American Art Museum
and the National Portrait Gallery, which share the Old Patent
Office Building in Penn Quarter. Reopened in mid-2006 after a six-
year renovation, the galleries’ art and venue both will wow you.
 Best places for art that moves: Hands down, this award has to go to
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is home
to the National Symphony, Washington Opera, Washington Ballet,
Washington Performing Arts Society, and many traveling shows, 
both classical and popular. See Chapter 15 for more information.
 Best spot to be emotionally moved: Somewhere there may be
someone who was untouched by a visit to the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum, but I have yet to meet him. More than a
reminder of Nazi atrocities, this museum also conducts memorable
programs about genocide. At Arlington National Cemetery, the
endless rows of plain white grave markers tug at your heart,
silently proclaiming the sacrifice of America’s military men and
women. Many famous Americans have more elaborate memorials
here, including presidents Kennedy and Taft. Emotions at the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial flow from the controversial nature of
that war and the constant presence of veterans and friends and rel-
atives of the dead, who search out specific names on the black
granite wall. The simplicity of young Chinese-American architect
Maya Lin’s design became a prototype for many later memorials
erected around the country.
 Best government building: The surroundings are a mess as I write
because of construction of an underground visitor center and ugly,
stop-gap security barricades, but the Capitol remains Washington’s
preeminent building. The dome is the number-one symbol of
American democracy. And the interior is a fascinating mix of the
American democratic spirit and ornate old European decoration.
With some luck, the construction will be done during the shelf-life
of this book, but don’t bet your tax refund on it.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Washington, D.C. 13

The Best Free Shows
For more info on the performing arts events listed, see Chapter 15.
 Best free classical music: For the best music ever written, per-
formed by a world-class orchestra, for free, under the stars, you
just can’t top the National Symphony’s free summer concerts at
the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Rock Creek Park and on the
Capitol’s west lawn.
 Best free play: You can equal the National Symphony’s excellence
(see preceding entry) with the best plays ever written and per-
formed by a world-class troupe, for free, under the stars. That
would be the Shakespeare Theatre’s no-charge summer perform-
ances, also at Carter Barron.
 Best free military music: The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air
Force bands present military concerts — where else? — at Carter
Barron and outside the Capitol.
 Best free who-knows-what: In the Kennedy Center’s Grand Foyer, 
the Millennium Stage presents free performances every single day at
6 p.m. Performers range from storytellers to headliners such as Bobby
McFerrin or the Pointer Sisters, although most are not well known.
The Best Stuff for Kids
For more information on the attractions listed, see Chapter 11.
 Best animals: With 2,400 animals on 163 acres of land, the National
Zoological Park — better known as the National Zoo — can keep kids
hopping till they run out of juice. If you get here during 2007, you may
be able to see Tai Shan, the first giant panda cub born and surviving
in D.C., before he’s sent off to his parents’ native digs in China.
 Best things to touch that you wouldn’t think you’d want to touch:
Children squeal with delight and parents feel a bit squeamish at the
National Museum of Natural History’s insect zoo. Pet a tarantula.
Hold a giant hissing cockroach. Crawl around in a model termite
mound.
 Best printed products: You wouldn’t think the National Postal
Museum would be a big hit with the small set, but the little museum’s
interactive exhibits have made it a children’s favorite. Kids also like
to tour the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, where stamps, cur-
rency, government bonds, and White House invitations are made.
Part of the reason is the jovial tour guides, whose red neckties are
decorated with images of dollars.
 Best flying objects: Because kids love things that go zoom, the
National Air and Space Museum is must-see D.C. for families.
Luckily, for parents, big folks find this place fascinating as well.

W
ashington, D.C., is a city where knowledge is power, so it helps to
arrive knowing some background information (even if you don’t
intend to run for office). You should know who Pierre L’Enfant is and
where Lincoln was assassinated. And if you expect to carry on conversa-
tions with local politicos, you should know the different between “pork”
and “POTUS.”
History 101: The Main Events
It all began, of course, with dinosaurs, then saber tooth tigers, and 
then human beings who eventually came to be called Native Americans.
But what is now called Washington didn’t really start its journey to
becoming the capital of the United States until those Europeans started
exploring what they thought of as the New World. Capt. John Smith, of
Pocahontas fame, poked around the Potomac River near Washington in
1608, and another group of early European immigrants began to settle
along the Anacostia River here in 1622.
Midway through the next century, the river port of George Towne (now
Georgetown) was founded, named for King George of England, not the
father of the still-unfounded United States. (The Old Stone House, built
there in 1765, has survived to become one of modern Washington’s very
oldest buildings, on bustling M Street.) With George Towne, Maryland,
and Alexandria, Virginia, developing as river ports, the colonies didn’t
look to this area for anything related to government until the end of the

Revolutionary War, when the Continental Congress began casting about
for the best place to locate the new nation’s capital.
In 1790, the new U.S. Congress, in one of many North-South compro-
mises, authorized President Washington to select a site on the Potomac
River, in the northern reaches of the Southern states. Washington, a sur-
veyor by trade, picked the confluence of the Potomac and the Anacostia,
a few miles upstream from his home at Mount Vernon, and hired French
engineer Pierre L’Enfant to design the city. The District of Columbia,
named for Christopher Columbus, was a perfect diamond, 10 miles on
each side, straddling the Potomac River, with 69 of its square miles
donated by Maryland and the remaining 31 by Virginia. (Virginia reclaimed
its land in 1846, making the Potomac Washington’s southwestern border.)
The federal government finally moved to D.C. in 1800, with the Capitol
and the Executive Mansion still unfinished. Fifteen years later, those
seminal structures of American democracy had to be rebuilt after being
burned by the British in 1814 during the so-called War of 1812. The refur-
bishers painted the president’s house white, and it’s been called the
White House ever since.
In the succeeding centuries, Washington has grown with the government
it houses and changed with the nation that government leads. During
the Civil War, President Lincoln ringed the capital city with forts and
insisted on completing the Capitol’s dome. As the government expanded
to fight the depression, the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration
hired the unemployed to build the new bureaucracies’ headquarters.
The Pentagon, the world’s largest office building, sprang to life during
World War II. Magnificent Union Station was opened during the heyday
of railroad travel in 1907, National Airport when commercial aviation
was coming into its own in 1941, and Metrorail in 1976 when the Wash-
ington region’s leaders realized they needed a subway system to move
their booming population off the ever-more-congested highways and
streets. In this new era of terrorism, on September 11, 2001, hijackers
crashed American Airlines flight 77 into a section of the Pentagon, which
was rebuilt and reopened in a year. (See the “Years to remember” side-
bar in this section.)
Many visitors don’t know this fact, but we D.C. residents don’t enjoy the
full benefits of U.S. citizenship because we don’t live in a state. We have
no voting representation in Congress, and Congress can override the
actions of our elected mayor and council. We are subject to all the obli-
gations of citizenship, however, including federal taxes and the draft.
That’s why the slogan on our license plates reads, “Taxation without 
representation.”

Architectural Basics
Washington architecture is a hodge-podge that just gets hodgier and
podgier as time runs on. Even though the city’s street plan largely fol-
lows architect L’Enfant’s original diamondlike approach, the buildings
that line the streets have been constructed willy-nilly according to the
whims of the owners and the tastes of the time.
Much like a medieval cathedral, the Capitol — D.C.’s most prominent
building — grew over the decades, and each section reflects not only the
vision of an architect but the on-site alterations of construction managers

as well. The Capitol Dome, perhaps the best-recognized symbol of
American self-government, wasn’t added until 1865. The West Front ter-
races were built between 1884 and 1892 and the East Front extension
from 1958 to 1962. As I write, the East Lawn is a mess, as an underground
visitor center is constructed.
You can find a real cathedral, the Washington National Cathedral, in the
residential Upper Northwest area. (See Chapter 8 for a description of the
neighborhood.) Under construction from 1907 to 1990, it was built the
old-fashioned way, “stone-on-stone,” with no structural steel for support.
The White House, designed by Irish architect James Hoban, was mod-
eled after an Irish country home. Columned porticos on the north and
south fronts were added later. The Old Executive Office Building next
door, sporting 900 Doric columns, is a surreal wedding cake in a style
dubbed Second Empire. Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery,
once the home of Robert E. Lee, is a classic plantation house, built by
slaves in Greek Revival style. It’s made of brick and covered by cement,
which was scored and painted to look like marble and sandstone. Union
Station is a marvelous Beaux Arts structure, built for the thriving rail-
road business at the beginning of the 20th century and restored as a
bustling transportation, shopping, eating, and entertainment center at
the century’s end.
Many government buildings and monuments pay tribute to ancient
Rome and Greece, with architects and committees again imposing their
own twists on the classical recipes. On a smaller, domestic scale, the 
residential streets of Georgetown and Capitol Hill are lined with 19th-
century town houses and mansions.
The Restaurant Scene
Washington doesn’t really have a distinct cuisine, and that’s not neces-
sarily a bad thing. Because every community in America is represented
in Congress, nearly every cuisine in America makes its way to at least
one eating establishment here. The same is true for the cuisines of the
world, because nearly every nation sends diplomats, journalists, and
business people to monitor and try to influence the U.S. government.
To the extent that any dishes can be called local, they’ve probably been
borrowed from Maryland’s nearby shore. If they’re in season and the
waiter assures you that they’re good, order up a crab-cake dinner or
sandwich. Or engage in the labor-intensive celebration of digging the
meat out of hard-shell crabs, an activity usually conducted on paper-
covered tables and accompanied by generous quantities of beer. Soft-
shell crabs, the same animal caught when it’s between hard shells, are
easier to eat.
The exception to the borrowed-cuisine rule is the half-smoke — a mild
sausage usually served on a hot dog bun. You’ll find half-smokes at
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C. 
18

nearly every sidewalk food cart and in many short-order eateries. The
only thing special about this sausage is that it doesn’t seem to be sold
under that name anyplace else.
For a more detailed look at D.C. food and restaurants, see Chapter 10.
The Local Lingo
What Washington lacks in unique food, it more than makes up for in
unique language — the jargon of politics and government. You’ll hear 
it spoken not only when you tour the halls of Congress but when you
eavesdrop on conversations in a restaurant, along the sidewalk, or on a
Metrorail train.
If you’re fluent in this jargon, then you know that a lawmaker doesn’t
propose a piece of legislation; he drops a bill. The heads of the powerful
House subcommittees that control spending bills are not chairmen;
they’re the college of cardinals. A gaggle is not a gathering of geese but a
gathering of reporters around a news source. You could write a book
about this stuff. In fact, several people already have. Check out Hatchet
Jobs & Hardball: American Political Slang, by Grant Barrett (Oxford
University Press).
Here are a few definitions of words or phrases you may hear and wonder
about as you wander about D.C.
 Advance man: A political operative who prepares an event before
the candidate arrives.
 Background: Interviewer-interviewee agreement by which the
information imparted can be reported but the source’s identity
must be kept confidential.
 Carpetbagger: Politician who moves into a new community to seek
power.
 Dark horse: Candidate who probably can’t win.
 Eleventh Commandment: GOP tradition — often honored in 
the breach — that Republicans should not speak ill of other
Republicans.
 Fat cat: Someone with lots of money.
 Gentle lady: What the gentlemen of the House call their female col-
leagues because, for some reason, just plain “lady” doesn’t suffice.
 Gerrymander: To draw odd-shaped legislative districts in order to
benefit the party in power.
 Hack: A low-ranking party worker who does what he’s told.
 Junket: A government official’s all-expenses-paid trip that has ques-
tionable value to government.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Washington, D.C. 19

 Lame duck: Government official who has been defeated or can’t
run for reelection.
 Off the record: Information that can’t be published.
 The other body: What the House calls the Senate and the Senate
calls the House.
 Pork: Legislated benefits for a small group rather than for the
national interest.
 POTUS: In acronym-obsessed Washington, the President of the
United States.
 Red tape: Bureaucratic rules that slow down action.
 SCOTUS: The Supreme Court of the United States.
 Smoke-filled room: Where politicians cut deals without public
scrutiny, and where today smoking probably isn’t allowed.
 Think tank: Organization that conducts research and analysis.
 Veep: The vice president.
 Waffle: Not taking a clear stand.
Recommended Movies and Books
My journalistic background may bias my analysis, but I think the best
tell-it-like-it-is Washington movie is All the President’s Men, starring
Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as then-young Washington Post
reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who broke the Watergate
scandal. This wonderful flick somehow manages to be entertaining while
showing how reporters really go about their (often tedious) jobs. A spec-
tacular overhead shot of Woodstein (as the pair was nicknamed) doing
research in the Library of Congress’s Main Reading Room marvelously
evokes two little guys tackling an enormous challenge. My favorite slice
of dialogue occurs when a big-shot politician issues the quintessentially
Washingtonian threat that if Woodward publishes certain information,
“our relationship will be over.” The young and politically unconnected
Woodward ponders for a moment and then replies, “We don’t have a
relationship.”
You can find many good books about Washington and the game of poli-
tics, starting with the real Woodward and Bernstein’s All the President’s
Men (Simon & Schuster), upon which the movie was based. Their boss,
Washington Post Co. publisher, president, and chair Katharine Graham,
collected and annotated more than 100 pieces about Washington that
were published posthumously as Katharine Graham’s Washington
(Vintage) in 2002. The annotations record the Washington of her lifetime,
from 1917 to preterrorist 2001, and showcase (sometimes surprisingly)
the words of John Dos Passos, Russell Baker, David Brinkley, Will Rogers,
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C. 
20

James Thurber, Simone de Beauvoir, and many more people. Theodore H.
White’s The Making of the President 1960 (Buccaneer) chronicles the
inside workings of the Kennedy-Nixon campaign race and changed politi-
cal reporting forever. In The Boys on the Bus (Random House), Timothy
Crouse reveals how the campaign press corps gets its inside stories.
Woodward again — this time with co-author Scott Armstrong — exposed
the inside workings of the Supreme Court in The Brethren (Island).
Not all Washington books are nonfiction — or particularly serious. This
town has spawned quite a few good mystery writers. Margaret Truman,
President Harry’s daughter, writes the “Capital Crime Series,” with (so
far) more than a dozen murder-mysteries set in various Washington loca-
tions: Murder in the White House (Fawcett), Murder in Georgetown
(Fawcett), Murder at the Library of Congress (Fawcett), Murder at
Ford’s Theatre (Ballantine), Murder on Capitol Hill (Fawcett), Murder
in the Supreme Court (Fawcett) . . . You get the bloody picture. Elliott
Roosevelt, son of President Harry’s predecessor, wrote such a successful
murder-mystery series that, since his 1990 death, his publisher (St.
Martin’s Minotaur) keeps issuing “Elliott Roosevelt Mysteries” written
by other (still living) authors. The detective-hero is Elliott’s mother, First
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and the murders often take place in a very vio-
lent White House. While alive, Elliott penned such titles as The White
House Pantry Murder (St. Martin’s), Murder in the Oval Office
(Avon), and Murder in the Rose Garden (St. Martin’s).
For hard-boiled private-eye action set in Washington’s mean streets not
often traversed by politicians or tourists, check out George Pelecanos’s
works, such as Right as Rain, Hell to Pay (both published by Warner),
or, most recently, The Night Gardener, in which homicide victims’
bodies turn up in D.C.’s community gardens.

Chapter 3
Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Joining (or avoiding) the crowds
 Understanding D.C.’s weather
 Choosing a season to visit
 Exploring Washington’s annual events
L
ife in Washington is affected by two kinds of seasons — Mother
Nature’s and Congress’s. Deciding when to visit will determine what
you can see, how much you pay, how many people you battle at the
attractions, and how your body feels about the weather.
Discovering the Secret of the Seasons
You can’t choose a bad time to visit D.C. if your primary goal is to see
the sights and you’re not concerned about the crowds, the temperature,
or the humidity. You can tour the museums, monuments, and govern-
ment buildings any season. Cultural, entertainment, and sports activities
are always going on. And shops are happy to provide their wares when-
ever you walk in with money.
Overall, the best times to visit D.C. are spring and fall — April through
mid-June and September through mid-November. Temperature and
humidity tend to be moderate. Flowers are on display in the spring. The
weather in the fall can be close to ideal. Congress is likely to be at work,
and cultural and entertainment activities are running full force.
Unfortunately, spring also brings crowds. I’ve always believed that all
Americans should visit Washington at least once. But it’s easy to grum-
ble as you pick your way through gangs of middle-school students block-
ing sidewalks as they wait for their tour buses to arrive.
In terms of expense, visiting in the spring means that you find fewer
lodging bargains, especially during the work week when business travel-
ers fill the hotels. In addition, events like the Cherry Blossom Festival
are so popular that hotels and restaurants can charge top prices.

You can find more bargains in hotter summer months, as hotels try to fill
the rooms that empty during Congressional vacations by offering money-
saving package deals. You can also enjoy a great deal of free, outdoor
entertainment in the summer.
If you’re anxious to see government in action, keep in mind that Congress
tries to take lengthy recesses in August and near year’s end. Another
strike against August is that it can feel like an equatorial rainforest —
excruciating heat, even more excruciating humidity, and frequent,
vicious thunderstorms. The National Weather Service says July is hotter
and has more rain, but August always feels worse.
Washington does get a real winter most years, usually with snow and
some periods of extreme cold in January and February, even though for
many years the city government seemed not to understand the concept
of snow and how to plow it. If you don’t mind the cold, Washington looks
gorgeous after a snowfall, especially when the Congressional Christmas
tree is on display at the foot of Capitol Hill. And the city has lately been
doing a better job of clearing the streets when the snow falls.
That said, why don’t you slip Vivaldi into your CD player and consider
the pros and cons of Washington’s four seasons?
Spring: Blooming beautiful in D.C.
Spring is a popular time for D.C. visits because:
 The days are clear and comfortable, and Washington is at its most
lush and beautiful.
 Gardens on and around the Mall (around the entire city, for that
matter) bloom with tulips, daffodils, cherry blossoms, dogwoods,
and azaleas.
However, keep in mind the following springtime pitfalls:
 Washington’s weather is always fickle. Scattered among the gor-
geous spring days are an occasional preview of summer’s heat,
humidity, and thunderstorms, along with a sporadic period that
feels a bit too cool. Wear layers of clothing and bring rain gear.
 Tourists, especially busloads of schoolchildren, pour in like a mon-
soon. Expect crowds, longer lines, and more traffic.
Summer: Having fun in the D.C. sun
Benefits of a summer visit include:
 The kids are out of school.
 Many hotels offer money-saving packages.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 23

 Many museums offer extended hours.
 Free events, such as outdoor concerts, are plentiful.
On the other hand:
 Summer means major heat, folks. And humidity. Both make fre-
quent appearances until well after Labor Day. (See Table 3-1 for
month-by-month averages of D.C.’s temperature and rainfall.)
 The influx of summer vacationers can mean longer-than-usual lines
at attractions and cold-drink vendors.
 Some theaters are dark (or at least darker) in July and August. If
you’re hoping to see a production by one of Washington’s theater
companies, check to make sure that it has summer offerings.

Fall: Harvest good times in Washington
If you don’t have to worry about school schedules, fall probably is the
best time to travel to D.C.:
 The weather is as good as it gets. Heat and humidity drop as the
calendar wears on.
 Lines are shorter; crowds are smaller.
 Entertainment and cultural opportunities abound.
But watch out for:
 Congress reconvenes, and the convention scene heats up, filling up
hotels and restaurants, particularly during the work week.
 Traffic can be worse than in summer. (But you’re too smart to drive
around Washington anyway, aren’t you?)
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C.

Winter: A great place to celebrate the holidays
Winter brings visions of softly falling snowflakes and holiday cheer,
although the snow often holds off until the holidays are over. Advantages
of a winter visit mean:
 You don’t need to worry about heat and humidity.
 Lines at museums and other attractions are short or nonexistent.
 Colorful, often free, holiday events are plentiful from December into
January.
 Airlines and tour operators offer good deals.
 When snow piles up on the ground, you get picture-postcard views
of the Capitol, the White House, and other photogenic buildings
and monuments.
 Congress and the White House set up their competing Christmas
trees. (The Congressional tree is better!)
Winter does have its downsides, however:
 While its average temperatures look good on paper, Washington
always is visited by some extremes. A damp, windy, 40-degree day
on the Mall can feel colder than zero in Alaska. And D.C. does get
real cold and windy winter weather — subzero temperatures and
even the occasional blizzard — if only for short spells.
 You have fewer opportunities for outdoor activities.
Washington’s Calendar of Capital Events
D.C.’s date book is jam-packed with special events. Some holidays cele-
brated throughout the country are extra-special here (Independence
Day, for example). I list available dates and times (note that D.C. is in the
Eastern Time Zone), but please double-check specifics before planning
your vacation around an event; they’re subject to change. See the Friday
“Weekend” section of the Washington Post for comprehensive, up-to-date
listings.
Because the easiest way to get around D.C. is by Metrorail — the local
subway — the event listings include the Metrorail stops closest to them.
The site listings in Part IV give detailed directions. Unless otherwise
noted, the events are free.
January
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, Birthday (% 202-426-6841; www.nps.gov/
linc; Metro: Foggy Bottom–George Washington University) is celebrated
in word and music on the third Monday in January at the Lincoln Memo-
rial, site of the great civil rights leader’s “I Have a Dream” speech.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 25

Inauguration Day, U.S. Capitol (Metro: McPherson Square, Federal
Triangle, Archives-Navy Memorial, Federal Center Southwest, Capitol
South, Union Station), occurs at noon on January 20 every fourth year,
the day the president is sworn in at the Capitol. A parade along Pennsyl-
vania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House follows the swearing
in. You need political contacts to get a seat on the Capitol lawn or on the
parade route bleachers. (A friend with an office window or balcony that
overlooks the route is good, too.) Otherwise, head for that long stretch
between Congress’s and the president’s workplaces that morning — the
earlier, the better. The next presidential inauguration is January 20, 2009.
January is Washington’s coldest month, so the inauguration can be a
bone-chilling event. Be prepared!
February
During Black History Month, African Americans’ struggles and achieve-
ments are commemorated in numerous ways throughout the city.
Museums, libraries, and other sites feature readings, speeches, musical
performances, and other events. Check these Web sites: National Park
Service (www.nps.gov/ncro/PublicAffairs/Calendar.htm), Smith-
sonian Institution (www.si.edu/events), and the Washington Conven-
tion and Tourism Corp. (www.washington.org).
On February 12, at noon, at the Lincoln Memorial, wreath-laying, band
music, and a dramatic reading of the Gettysburg Address mark Abraham
Lincoln’s Birthday, Lincoln Memorial (% 202-426-6841; www.nps.gov/
linc; Metro: Foggy Bottom–George Washington University).
March
As with Black History Month, many Washington institutions commemo-
rate the achievements of women during Women’s History Month, vari-
ous locations. You can find information on the Internet from the National
Park Service at www.nps.gov/ncro/PublicAffairs/Calendar.htm,
the Smithsonian Institution at www.si.edu/events, and the Washington
Convention and Tourism Corp. at www.washington.org.
March to April
At the Smithsonian Kite Festival, Washington Monument grounds 
(% 202-633-1000; Metro: Smithsonian), you can compete, watch the
experts, or just find a place to fly your own kite. The Smithsonian
Associates and the National Air and Space Museum sponsor this care-
free Washington tradition, usually in late March or early April, in con-
junction with the Cherry Blossom Festival.
Daily events bloom all over town during the National Cherry Blossom
Festival, at various locations (www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.
org), which runs for about two weeks in March and April. The official
highlight is the parade near the end of the festivities. But the real stars
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C. 
26

are the cherry blossoms, especially those around the Tidal Basin, and
they make their appearances whenever they darn well please. Click
“Bloom Watch” at the festival’s Web site for info on projected peak
blooming dates. The blooms provide a great backdrop and canopy for a
picnic at the Tidal Basin or on the Washington Monument Grounds.
Since 1878, presidents have invited children to roll eggs on the White
House lawn the Monday after Easter at the White House Easter Egg Roll
(% 202-456-7041; www.whitehouse.gov/easter; Metro: McPherson
Square). Modern presidents have added entertainment — inside and
outside the White House grounds — to occupy the youngsters during
the inevitable waits in line. Free tickets timed for entrance are distrib-
uted first-come, first-served at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion on the south-
west corner of 15th and E streets NW. Most tickets are distributed
beginning at 7:30 a.m. Saturday, with some additional tickets made avail-
able beginning at 7:30 a.m. Monday. Lines can be gargantuan. Children of
all ages can attend, as long as at least one child is 7 or younger and no
more than two adults are in the group.
Note: Rules for Egg Roll admission are subject to change from year to
year, so be sure to check before your visit. Outdoor events are also
affected by bad weather.
April
For four days in mid-April, more than 100 artisans from around the coun-
try, selected from more than 1,000 entrants, display their expertise at
basketry, ceramics, decorative fiber, furniture, glass, jewelry, leather,
metal, mixed media, paper, wearable art, and wood during the Smith-
sonian Craft Show, National Building Museum, 401 F St. NW (% 888-
832-9554; www.smithsoniancraftshow.org; Metro: Judiciary Square).
The Smithsonian calls this “the nation’s most prestigious juried exhibi-
tion and sale of contemporary American crafts.” Admission is $15 for
adults; $12 for seniors, students, military, and Smithsonian Associates;
free for children 12 and younger (but strollers are not permitted). If you
come with 11 friends, you can purchase 12 tickets in advance for $120.
May
What better place to mark Memorial Day than Washington, D.C., the site
of so many memorials? Ceremonies abound at monuments to American
heroes of the past. One of the most moving begins with a wreath-laying
at 11 a.m. at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery,
where members of the Army’s 3rd Infantry, the Old Guard, place flags at
more than 260,000 graves just prior to the weekend (% 703-607-8000;
www.arlingtoncemetery.org). Usually, the president or another high-
ranking government official participates.
One of the most pleasant places to be on Memorial Day weekend is on 
a blanket or a folding chair on the Capitol’s West Lawn as the National
Symphony Orchestra presents its Memorial Day Concert at 8 p.m. on
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 27

Sunday (% 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600; www.kennedy-center.org/
nso; Metro: Capitol South, Union Station, Federal Center Southwest).
The rain date is Memorial Day itself, but the concert is rarely postponed
unless the weather is truly terrible. With the performers enclosed in a
band shell and a national audience looking on via PBS, the concert isn’t
rescheduled lightly. This event is eclectic, with classical, popular, and
patriotic music performed by the orchestra and glamorous guest stars,
and it draws a big crowd.
You can catch the dress rehearsal at 7:30 p.m. the day before the National
Symphony’s Memorial Day concert at the Capitol.
June
Traditional music, crafts, and ethnic foods from the United States and
around the world fill the Mall with enticing sounds, sights, and scents
from late June through early July during the Smithsonian Festival of
American Folklife (% 202-275-1150; www.folklife.si.edu/center/
festival.html; Metro: Smithsonian). One of Washington’s premier out-
door events, the festival typically highlights one or two states and for-
eign countries.
July
The nation’s capital does it up big for the nation’s Independence Day
Celebration. Highlights include the parade along Constitution Avenue
starting a little before noon, the National Symphony Orchestra concert
(again with big-name guests) on the Capitol’s West Lawn at 8 p.m., and
the fireworks launched from around the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting
Pool shortly after 9 p.m. Oh, and the Smithsonian Festival of American
Folklife (see preceding entry) is in full swing! Expect big crowds, espe-
cially at the Capitol for the concert. Popular spots for viewing the fire-
works include the Mall, the Jefferson Memorial, the Ellipse behind the
White House, the Marine Corps (Iwo Jima) Memorial, and areas along
the Virginia side of the Potomac River that can be reached from George
Washington Memorial Parkway parking lots.
Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, July 4 visitors to the Mall have had to
pass through security checkpoints. You can’t have alcoholic beverages,
glass bottles, fireworks, or grills on the Mall or other surrounding federal
land, including the banks of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers.
Here’s another place the locals go to watch the fireworks: the Key
Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River between Georgetown and
Arlington. Get there early to grab a railing-side spot. There’s no seating,
and you can stand on the sidewalks only (not in the traffic lanes).
To avoid the July 4 crowds, you can catch the same show (sans fire-
works) at the Capitol concert dress rehearsal at 7:30 p.m. July 3.
Part I: Introducing Washington, D.C.

August
On an August evening each year, the U.S. Army Band performs Tchai-
kovsky’s rousing “1812 Overture” (Sylvan Theater at the Washington
Monument; % 703-696-3399; www.mdw.army.mil; Metro: Smithsonian),
accompanied by cannon fire from the Presidential Salute Gun Battery of
The Old Guard (the 3rd Infantry Regiment). Call or check the Web site
for the exact date (% 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600; www.kennedy-
center.org/nso).
September
Washingtonians mark the end of summer by toting blankets and folding
chairs to the Capitol Lawn and listening to the National Symphony
Orchestra perform its Labor Day Concert (% 800-444-1324 or 202-
467-4600; www.kennedy-center.org/nso; Metro: Capitol South, Union
Station, Federal Center Southwest) with some guest celebrities. The con-
cert starts at 8 p.m. on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend.
During the Kennedy Center Open House, Kennedy Center (% 800-444-
1324 or 202-467-4600; www.kennedy-center.org; Metro: Foggy Bottom–
George Washington University), the hall and grounds of the performing
arts center showcase performances in music, theater, and dance, along
with special activities for kids. This event is popular, so be prepared to
encounter lines for the inside events.
Hundreds of thousands of parents, grandparents, and children flock to
the National Mall for the two-day Black Family Reunion (% 202-737-
0120; www.ncnw.org/events/reunion.htm; Metro: Smithsonian), a cel-
ebration of African-American heritage. The festival features music, food,
arts, crafts, and pavilions dedicated to such subjects as health, sports,
and education.
If reading’s your thing, you can get your fill of books, book-signings,
author speeches, and other things literary at the National Book Festival
(% 888-714-4696; www.loc.gov/bookfest; Metro: Smithsonian). It’s
free, on the Mall, and sponsored by the folks at the Library of Congress,
who know a thing or three about the subject at hand.
October
The famous Marine Corps Marathon (% 800-786-8762; www.marine
marathon.com) is so popular that registration for the 34,000 (!) runners’
slots fills up in less than three days. Go to the Web site to find out when
registration opens (probably in May). The race, on the last Sunday of
October, is nicknamed the “Marathon of the Monuments” for good reason.
It starts near the Iwo Jima statue at the edge of Arlington Cemetery and
winds through Georgetown and the core of D.C., passing the major
memorials, Smithsonian museums, White House, Capitol, and Pentagon
before returning to the starting point. You don’t have to be a world-class
runner to participate. Many highly fit amateurs rise to this challenge. If
you’re not a runner, stake out a spot along the route and watch.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29

November
During the Veterans’ Day Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery 
(% 703-607-8000; www.arlingtoncemetery.org; Metro: Arlington
Cemetery), the president or another high-ranking government official
lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at 11 a.m. November 11.
December
In early December, a member of the First Family throws a switch to light
the large Christmas tree in the Ellipse. The White House Christmas Tree
Lighting (www.pageantofpeace.org/opening.htm; Metro: Federal
Triangle) kicks off the Pageant of Peace, which continues most of the
month. Features include a Yule Log, a circle of smaller trees — each deco-
rated on the theme of a state, territory, or the District of Columbia —
and musical performances from 6 to 8:30 p.m. most nights. Free tickets
for the lighting are distributed first-come, first-served at the Ellipse
Visitor Pavilion on the southwest corner of 15th and E streets NW. One
person can get four tickets, and they can disappear in less than an hour.
People have been known to get in line nine hours early! Tickets usually
are distributed on the first Saturday in November. Check this Web site
for details: www.nps.gov/whho/pageant.htm. Tickets aren’t needed for
the rest of the pageant.
Keep in mind that it gets bitterly cold in Washington in the winter from
time to time. If it’s cold when you visit, bundle up good, or you may
spend all your time at the pageant huddled beside the burning Yule Log.
During the Kennedy Center Holiday Celebrations (% 800-444-1324 or
202-467-4600; www.kennedy-center.org; Metro: Foggy Bottom–George
Washington University), the performing arts center hosts holiday-
themed events throughout the month, including dancing in the Grand
Foyer on New Year’s Eve and a Christmas Eve performance of Handel’s
Messiah by the National Symphony and the National Cathedral’s Choral
Society.

his part helps you get serious about planning your 
visit. Here you ﬁnd the nitty-gritty about options — and
costs — for your trip. I compile some tips for keeping your
possessions safe and what to do if you lose something. Then I
give advice for folks with special needs or interests: families,
seniors, travelers with limited mobility, and gay and lesbian
visitors to D.C.

W
hen I was a newspaper reporter, a joke around the Washington
bureau was that the only guy on staff who thought D.C. living
costs were reasonable was the guy who transferred from Tokyo!
Washington is not a cheap place to live, especially when it comes to
housing. But, believe it or not, the District can be a reasonably priced
place to visit. Many attractions and events are free, and you can take
cheap public transportation to most places. You also can use this book
to find good deals at places where prices often are sky high.
Planning Your Budget
No matter how clever a traveler you are — unless you’re staying with
friends who feed you and schlep you around town — you can’t avoid
opening your wallet to eat here, sleep here, get here, get around here,
and enjoy some of Washington’s entertainment options.
Transportation
D.C. offers many forms of local transportation. Some are easier on your
pocketbook — and stress level — than others.
The most expensive — and nerve-shattering — is driving yourself. If you
drive to D.C., park your car when you get here and don’t touch it until
you leave. Even then, you may be charged $20 or more each night for
parking at your hotel. (For a list of other typical D.C. costs, see Table 4-1.)
No one in his or her right mind drives while sightseeing here. The streets
are too crowded. There’s not enough street parking. Garage parking fees
reach the stratosphere. All the circles, squares, and meandering avenues
make for mind-numbing traffic patterns. Washington is full of important
people — or people who think they’re important — and they drive as
though the function of all other vehicles is to get out of their way.

The good news is that cabs are relatively cheap, the Metrorail subway
system is one of the best in the world, and the Metrobuses can take you
just about any place you want to go.
Metrorail (% 202-637-7000; www.wmata.com) is the first choice for
moving around town, because it’s fast, clean, comfortable, and reason-
ably priced. You can find stations near most major attractions. It starts
running at 5 a.m. Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. on weekends, and
closes at midnight Sunday through Thursday, 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
Fares, based on distance traveled, range from $1.35 to $2.35 per trip,
except during weekday rush hours and after 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday;
then, the range is $1.35 to $3.90. When you travel among the main attrac-
tions from Capitol Hill to Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom, you pay just
$1.35 at any time. Up to two children ages four and younger ride free
with a paying adult. If you travel during peak morning and evening com-
mute time, expect standing-room-only, packed-like-sardines crowds on
the trains. Get comprehensive information about routes, schedules, and
fares at the service windows in the Metro Center Station. Informational
signs and manned kiosks are located at every station entrance.

34

Most Metrobuses (% 202-637-7000; www.wmata.com) run all the time,
but less frequently in the wee hours and on weekends. The fare is just
$1.25, unless you stumble onto one of the few express buses that cost $3.
Bus-to-bus Metro Transfers are free. Transferring from Metrorail to
Metrobus costs 35¢. Get the transfer from a machine in the station
where you enter the Metrorail system. There is no bus-to-rail transfer
discount.
Taxis cost less than in most big cities, but the bizarre fare structure can
baffle longtime residents as well as first-time tourists. D.C. taxis don’t
have meters. Instead, the city is divided into zones, and you’re charged
according to the zones you travel through. You see a map — with north
NOT at the top! — posted in the back seat of the taxi. A cab ride to a des-
tination within the same zone costs $6.50. Crossing into another zone
makes the fare $8.80, and it continues to increase as more zones are
entered. Then add $1.50 for each passenger older than five who accom-
panies you, $1 for trips during the 7 to 9:30 a.m. or 4 to 6:30 p.m. week-
day rush hours, 50¢ to $2 for luggage handled by the driver depending
on its size, and $2 if you telephone for a cab instead of hail it on the
street. There’s a $1.75 surcharge for single passengers at National
Airport and a $2.50 surcharge when the DC Taxicab Commission
declares a snow emergency. If you take a D.C. cab into the suburbs (to
an airport, for example), you’re charged by the mile as the cabby reads
it on his odometer. The good news for tourists is that Zone 1 contains
many major attractions, including the Capitol, White House, and
Smithsonian museums on the Mall. The bad news is that humidity, air
pressure, and phases of the moon can alter the fare calculations — or, at
least, it seems that way. The fare downtown from National Airport is
about $12. It’s about $55 from Dulles and $60 to $65 from Baltimore/
Washington International. D.C. cabbies are allowed to pick up additional
passengers without the consent of the original passenger, as long as the
original passenger doesn’t have to go more than 5 blocks out of the way.
(The driver needs the original passenger’s consent if the subsequent
passenger has a pet or other animal, unless it’s a service dog.) In that
circumstance, each passenger pays full fare for his or her trip, so it’s to
the cabby’s advantage to double up. But it seldom happens. Washington
cabbies cruise major government/business/tourist areas and usually are
easy to find during the day and early evening. Off-hours and off-the-
beaten-track, cabs can be nearly impossible to hail. Try outside a major
hotel. Or pay the surcharge to summon a taxi by phone. Two of the
bigger D.C. taxi organizations are Diamond Cab (% 202-387-6200) and
Yellow Cab (% 202-544-1212).
To find out a fare before you ride, call the D.C. Taxicab Commission at
% 202-645-6018, or check out the D.C. government’s cool fare calculator
at www.citizenatlas.dc.gov/atlasapps/taxifare.aspx.
Another option is to sit back and relax on Tourmobile (% 202-554-5100,
888-868-7707; www.tourmobile.com), an open-sided tram that makes
about 15 stops near top tourist sites daily except December 25. The
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35

Tourmobile is a great way to get an overview of the top attractions and
is especially attractive to families, the elderly, travelers with disabilities,
and the weary of all ages. For $20 ($10 for children 3 through 11, free for
younger kids), you can get off and reboard as many times as you want
between 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and ride until 4:30 p.m. You can buy tick-
ets from the driver (no credit cards) or at Tourmobile ticket booths.
The final good news for travelers watching their wallets is that D.C. is
pedestrian friendly. Because many of the top sights are close to each
other, walking often is the best way to travel between them. Just watch
for those self-obsessed Washington drivers.
Lodging
You can spend as little as $32 a night for a bed in dormitory-like rooms
at Hostelling International (% 202-737-2333; hiwashingtondc.org) or
pay $4,200 for a night in the best suite at the Willard InterContinental
(% 888-424-6835 or 202-628-9100; www.washington.intercontinental.
com). In between those extremes, you’ll find it just about impossible to
obtain undiscounted, high-season rates below $125. Without landing a
special deal, you’ll have to view anything less than $200 as a modest
price. But deals abound. If you make like Sherlock Holmes, you may be
able to sleuth your way to a room for less than $100 at a no-frills hotel or
a B&B. (See Chapter 9 for hotel listings.)
If you have a flexible schedule, you can save by visiting D.C. when things
are slow and hotels slash prices to fill rooms. That would be Thanksgiving
through New Year’s, July, August, and weekends year-round.
You also can save by putting a little extra effort into your hotel search.
Check a couple of online travel agencies, such as Expedia.com and
Travelocity.com. If a hotel has a toll-free phone number, call it and the
local number as well. Check the hotel’s Internet site, too. After a reserva-
tion clerk quotes you a price, ask whether he’s got anything better. Then
ask again. It’s amazing how often you’ll find different prices with each
query. Also be sure to mention your membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-
flier programs, hotel frequent-sleeper programs, and any other corporate
rewards programs. Government employees often qualify for discounts.
Dining
As with lodging, you can spend whatever you want to dine in D.C. One
Italian chef, the highly regarded Roberto Donna, illustrates this fact by
himself. Prices at Galileo (% 202-331-0880; www.robertodonna.com),
Donna’s downtown restaurant, are high. But Donna also runs restaurants
within that restaurant, where prices are both substantially higher and
downright bargains. In Laboratorio, Donna’s private dining room with
open kitchen, you’ll pay $125 for a weekend dinner, or $200 with per-
fectly matched wines. Galileo’s bar serves inexpensive lunches, and at
dinner offers appetizers, pastas, main courses, side dishes, and desserts
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
36

for $12 or less. Also at lunch, Donna periodically fires up a barbecue and
sells sandwiches for less than $10.
Galileo was scheduled to be closed for remodeling until late summer or
early fall of 2007.
Food bargains are scattered throughout the city. Not surprisingly, many
Asian and Mexican/Southwestern restaurants offer tasty meals at modest
prices. D.C. is experiencing a boom in restaurants that serve little dishes
in the $5 to $10 range — Spanish tapas and Mediterranean meze, for
instance. And the District has some home-grown diners, delis, and bak-
eries that serve inexpensive salads, sandwiches, and soups — even blue-
plate specials — for less than $10.
You also can save while sampling expensive restaurants by opting for
early-bird specials, post-theater menus, and fixed-price deals, as well as
eating your main meal at lunch when prices are lower. (See Chapter 10
for restaurant listings.)
Sightseeing
Seeing the sights is Washington’s best bargain. You can walk into almost all
of D.C.’s top attractions for free. (See Chapter 11 for attractions listings.)
Shopping
Washington’s no New York, London, or Paris when it comes to shopping.
And, in this case, the comparison’s not in D.C.’s favor. Once again, you
can spend at any level. Major department stores and other national
chain shops are scattered around town. But the most interesting 
shopping is that which is unique to Washington or at least special to
Washingtonians.
Most museums and galleries have shops built upon their exhibits — 
jewelry, textiles, and other crafts at the American Indian Museum
(% 202-633-1000; www.nmai.si.edu), astronaut ice cream at the Air
and Space Museum (% 202-633-1000; www.nasm.si.edu), prints of the
National Gallery’s paintings (% 202-737-4215; www.nga.gov), and the
annual White House Christmas ornament at the White House Visitor
Center (% 202-208-1631; www.nps.gov/whho/planyourvisit/
indooractivities.htm). Washingtonians tend to be avid readers, so
you can choose from many bookstores, from those at many museums to
niche stores devoted to gay/lesbian, feminist, African-American, and
New Age literature.
Quaint and rowdy Georgetown is stuffed with quaint and rowdy shops
that sell antiques, art, vintage comic books, movie posters, biker boots,
and exotic clothing. Union Station (% 202-289-1908; www.unionstation
dc.com) contains a multilevel shopping mall with chain stores and small
shops specializing in American and international crafts. Washingtonians
frequent Adams-Morgan, the city’s most ethnically diverse neighbor-
hood, for imports, unusual clothing, and secondhand goods.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

For flea market action, head for Capitol Hill’s Victorian-era Eastern
Market (% 202-544-0083; www.easternmarket.net) on Sundays. For 
a miniature version of Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive, explore Wisconsin
Avenue where it crosses the D.C.-Maryland border in the Friendship
Heights neighborhood. If your vacations must include a discount mall
visit, drive 26 miles south on I-95 (yuck!) to enormous Potomac Mills
(% 800-826-4557, 703-496-9301; www.potomacmills.com).
Nightlife
If you want to catch a big show, concert, or major dance performance,
you’ll pay $20 to $80 for most seats. If your budget won’t stretch that far,
Washington — the land of the freebie — will come to your rescue.
The Kennedy Center’s Millennium Stage (% 202-467-4600, 800-444-
1324; www.kennedy-center.org/programs/millennium) serves up
free entertainment nightly throughout the year. The National Symphony
Orchestra (% 202-467-4600 and 800-444-1324; www.kennedy-center.
org/nso) and military bands play free outdoor concerts at several sites
throughout the summer. The Shakespeare Theatre (% 202-547-1122;
www.shakespearetheatre.org) performs outdoors for free for about 
a week each summer.
Most Washington bars and nightclubs don’t impose cover charges,
although you may be unpleasantly surprised at what they charge for
beverages.
TicketPlace (% 202-842-5387; www.ticketplace.org) sells tickets at a
discount for same-day performances Tuesday through Saturday. Sunday
and Monday tickets are sold on Saturday, and there are some other
advance sales. You can call for recorded information around the clock.
The TicketPlace box office, at 407 7th St. NW between D and E streets, is
open Tuesday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. You also can purchase some tickets online Tuesday
through Friday from noon to 4 p.m. Some tickets are available only
online and not at the box office. After service charges are added, the box
office sells tickets for 62 percent of face value. Online sales are 67 per-
cent of face value.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
To conserve your cash, follow these tips:
 Visit in the off season. In Washington, that means Thanksgiving
through New Year’s, July, August, and weekends year-round. That’s
because Congress tries to be away at those times, so fewer busi-
ness travelers are in town.
 Travel midweek. You sometimes can find cheaper flights on
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. When you ask about airfares,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
38

see whether you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Package it. You sometimes can save money by booking a package
that includes airfare, hotel, sightseeing, restaurant perks, and
maybe even ground transportation. For particulars, call a travel
agent or visit an online travel agency (see Chapter 5).
 Rent a kitchen. Dining out three times a day adds up, even if you
take all your meals at hamburger joints and pizza parlors. Book a
hotel room or suite with a kitchen, and you can make breakfasts
and late-night snacks for a lot less than you’d pay at restaurants. A
refrigerator and microwave are particularly handy when you’re
traveling with kids.
 Opt for kids-stay-free hotels. You can save money at hotels that let
kids stay free in their parents’ room. Ask whether two double beds
or a sofa bed or rollaway is available.
 BYOM (bring your own munchies). Toss pre-purchased snacks
into your backpack each day. They’re cheaper than buying them in
vending machines or from tourist-area stands. Easy access to
appropriate munchies helps keep the younger tourists contented.
 Bring a water bottle for each member of your party. Refill the bot-
tles from water fountains as you trek around town. This way, you
avoid paying for pricey sodas or bottled H2O. And having water on
hand makes it easy for you to stay hydrated — an important health
concern in hot weather.
 Take Metrorail or hoof it. You can get around D.C. on the cheap by
utilizing the subway and your feet. If you’re planning to take at least
five Metrorail (% 202-637-7000; www.wmata.com) trips in a day,
purchase an all-day fare card for $6.50, and you can get on and off
the subway as many times as you like after 9:30 a.m. on weekdays
and all day on weekends and holidays. For $22, a seven-day short-
trip pass covers any fare up to $2.20, which will take you between
most tourist attractions. You can pay the extra cost of more-
expensive trips at the Exitfare machine when leaving the station.
An unlimited seven-day pass costs $33. You can buy the passes at
station vending machines marked “Passes/Farecards,” and from
sales personnel at the Metro Center Metrorail station and some
retail stores. When you’re not taking the subway, walk. Or hop the 
30-series buses for trips along all of Wisconsin Avenue, most of
Pennsylvania Avenue, and M Street in eastern Georgetown. Passes
for unlimited bus riding (except on special express buses) cost $3
for a day and $11 for a week.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 39

 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at a top restaurant,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories may be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the FBI T-shirts, Washington Monument key
chains, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than usual (unless you happen to eat
out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let your mind slip
into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about watching your wallet.
But, those factors aside, the only type of payment that won’t be quite 
as available to you away from home is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span
the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which network
you’re on and then call or check online for ATM locations at your desti-
nation. Make sure that you know your personal identification number
(PIN) before you leave home, and don’t forget to find out your daily with-
drawal limit before you depart. Also keep in mind that many banks
impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM. On
top of this charge, the bank from which you withdraw cash may add its
own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees within the United States, go to
www.bankrate.com and click on the “checking and savings” tab. For
international withdrawal fees, ask your bank. You can find 24-hour ATMs
on nearly every street corner in D.C., it seems, as well as in hotel lob-
bies, many public buildings, and some grocery stores and restaurants.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You also can withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the phone number on the
back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually
takes five to seven business days, though some banks will provide the
number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or
some other personal information.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
40

Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash 
as needed. Keep in mind, however, that you’ll likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. So, if you’re withdrawing
money every day, it may be cheaper to pay the traveler’s checks fee —
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You also can get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; AmEx gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1-percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can
obtain Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices and for a fee by
calling % 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call
% 800-223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they’re
stolen or lost. You can get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover that your wallet has been lost or stolen, and file a report at the
nearest police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may
require a police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card
companies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers in the United States:
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-
1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com).
Taxing Matters
The D.C. general sales tax is 5.75 percent, restaurant tax is 10 percent,
and hotel tax is 14.5 percent. Maryland’s sales and restaurant taxes are 
5 percent. An additional 1-percent to 10-percent lodging and amusement
tax may be imposed by Maryland localities. Virginia’s general sales tax is
4.5 percent, with local options for taxes on lodging, restaurants, and
admissions to events.

Getting to Washington, D.C.
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how to get here
 Comparing Washington’s airports and train station
 Finding the best fares
 Considering a package tour
O
ne of Washington’s assets is an abundance of ways to get here. D.C.
has terrific train service between here and New York. If train travel
is your thing, you can find service up and down the East Coast, with less
appealing routes to and from the west. Metropolitan Washington also
has three major airports, all served by major airlines. And, of course, the
city is connected to the Interstate Highway System — though driving
into town is no fun, and driving in town is even worse.
Flying to Washington, D.C.
The city’s three major airports compete with each other and encourage
price competition among the airlines. Each has distinct advantages and
disadvantages for the traveler.
Check if your hotel offers free or inexpensive transportation to and from
the airport or offers a discount on the SuperShuttle van.
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (% 703-417-8000; www.
metwashairports.com/national), known to locals simply as “National,”
is the most convenient. Washington Dulles International Airport
(% 703-572-2700; www.metwashairports.com/dulles), known, natu-
rally, as “Dulles,” is 26 miles west of downtown in what used to be the
Virginia countryside. Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood
Marshall Airport (% 800-435-9294; www.bwiairport.com) is 33 miles
northeast of D.C. and is known by its acronym, “BWI.”
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
Republican members of Congress, who didn’t think enough things had
been named for the 40th president, bestowed this rather lengthy moniker
on the airport. (It’s located in Arlington, Virginia, and is managed by a
regional authority.) The locals, for the most part, still call it National.

Nomenclature aside, National is a marvelous airport. The original termi-
nal, opened in 1941 on the eve of America’s entry into World War II, is a
historic structure that is being restored and will stay in use. The new ter-
minal, opened in 1997, is a striking, modern architectural triumph, with
picture-window views across the Potomac River to Washington’s land-
marks. The views from planes arriving from the north and west are spec-
tacular as well, especially after dark, as you can clearly see Washington’s
most familiar buildings and monuments from the approaching aircraft.
The new terminal was designed by renowned architect Cesar Pelli and
has original art incorporated throughout it.
The food options at National are decent for an airport, including a few
sit-down chain restaurants such as Legal Sea Foods and T.G.I. Friday’s. If
you find yourself in need of last-minute gifts or souvenirs, you can choose
from a couple dozen shops, including a Smithsonian Institution store.
The airport is compact and easy to get around. With all the security
added in the wake of September 11, 2001, National is probably the 
safest airport in the world to fly into or out of. And you can’t beat the
convenience.
Metrorail Yellow Line and Blue Line trains connect National with down-
town D.C. stations in less than 20 minutes for about $1.35 to $1.65. A taxi
to downtown costs about $11 to $12 (before tip) and takes 15 to 20 min-
utes (depending, of course, on Washington’s notorious traffic). Super-
Shuttle (% 800-258-3826; www.supershuttle.com) provides door-to-
door shared van service to downtown for about $13 for one passenger,
$8 for each additional passenger.
National’s downside includes the fact that it is “national.” If you want to
fly here nonstop from outside the United States, Montreal, Toronto, or
Bermuda, you have to touch down at Dulles or BWI. The airport also has
fewer long-distance flights within the United States. Noise restrictions
limit traffic late at night and early in the morning. And, because it’s so
close to the city, the airport has a high demand for its flights, so you find
fewer bargains at National than at Dulles or BWI. “Fewer” doesn’t mean
“none,” however. If you book early and follow the tips listed in the sec-
tion “Getting the best deal on airfares,” later in this chapter, you can find
good prices at National as well.
The following airlines serve National Airport: Air Canada, Air Tran,
Alaska, American, ATA, Continental, Delta, Frontier, Midwest, Northwest,
Spirit, United, and US Airways. The airport also is served by the regional
carriers Allegheny and American. (See the Quick Concierge at the back
of this book for complete listings of phone numbers and Web sites.)
Washington Dulles International Airport
Like Reagan Airport, Dulles also sports impressive architecture: the
soaring main terminal. Designed by highly regarded architect Eero
Saarinen, it opened to many oohs and ahs in 1962. The airport’s main

D.C. Metropolitan Area
Chapter 5: Getting to Washington, D.C. 45
attractions today are its international and long-haul domestic service
and its sometimes-better fares than those found at National. At Dulles,
you can even catch a flight on Aeroflot . . . should you happen to want to
catch a flight on Aeroflot.
Dulles’s main disadvantage is location — of the airport itself, within met-
ropolitan Washington, and of the facilities within the airport. The cab ride
to D.C. takes about 45 minutes in favorable traffic and costs about $55.
The SuperShuttle (% 800-258-3826; www.supershuttle.com) van
charges $22 for the first passenger and $10 for each companion.

Travel within the airport is a bit of a challenge as well. Dulles has grown
and grown. As new terminals were added, airport architects didn’t
bother to connect them. Not many of Dulles’s gates are at the main ter-
minal. As a result, for most travelers, entering the terminal is just the
beginning of their airport journey. If you land at Dulles, you’ll probably
deplane at one of the so-called “midfield” terminals. You then make your
way to a loading zone where you board a monstrous bus (euphemisti-
cally called a “mobile lounge”). You then debus at the main terminal.
Some of these contraptions take passengers directly to and from the
planes.
One time when I flew out of Dulles, I hopped onto the wrong mobile
lounge, which took me to the wrong midfield terminal, which left me
puzzling for a bit over why I didn’t see any signs to my gate. When I fig-
ured out what I had done, I had to take another mobile lounge back to
the main terminal and then another back to the right midfield terminal.
Fortunately, because I had arrived at the airport early, I still caught my
flight. This escapade is one of many reasons I always leave myself a lot
of extra time when I set out for an airport — and even more when the
airport is Dulles.
The cheapest trip from Dulles to D.C. is by the 5A express Metrobus,
which drops you at L’Enfant Plaza, a couple blocks south of the National
Mall, which has a Metrorail station, or at the Rosslyn Metrorail station in
Virginia, across the river from Georgetown. The ride costs $3. It departs
Dulles every 40 to 50 minutes from 5:50 a.m. to 11:40 p.m. on weekdays.
Hourly weekend service is offered from 6:32 a.m. to 11:40 p.m.
Airlines serving Dulles Airport are: Aeroflot, Air Canada, Air France, 
Air Tran, ANA, American, Austrian, British Airways, Continental, Delta,
Ethiopian, JetBlue, KLM Royal Dutch, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Max Jet,
Northwest, SAS, Saudi Arabian, South African, Southwest, Sun Country,
TACA, TED, United, US Airways, and Virgin Atlantic. (See the Quick
Concierge at the back of this book for complete listings of phone num-
bers and Web sites.)
Baltimore/Washington International 
Thurgood Marshall Airport
BWI’s mouthful of a moniker exceeds even National’s, but at least it was
the locals who decided to add the name of the native son who grew up
to become a prime leader of the Civil Rights movement and the first
black justice of the Supreme Court. BWI’s prime attraction is price. Its
distance from Washington means airlines have to try a little harder to
attract D.C. clientele. That means that often — though not always — you
can find cheaper airfares at BWI than at National.
BWI’s disadvantage is, like Dulles’s, location. By cab, you’re 45 to 60 
minutes and $60 to $65 away from downtown D.C., if the traffic flows
smoothly. The SuperShuttle (% 800-258-3826; www.supershuttle.
com) van service sets you back $31 for the first passenger and $11 for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
46

each companion. At least when you walk into BWI’s terminal, though,
you don’t have to take a bus to your plane.
As at Dulles, Metrobus runs a $3 express from BWI — this one to the
Greenbelt Metrorail station. The B30 bus leaves the airport every 40
minutes between 6:58 a.m. and 10:50 p.m. weekdays, 9:38 a.m. to 10:48
p.m. weekends. From the Greenbelt station, the Metrorail ride to Penn
Quarter costs between $2.35 and $3.05 and takes about 25 minutes.
On weekdays, you also can ride the MARC train (% 800-325-7245;
www.mtamaryland.com) from BWI to Union Station for $6. Trains run
between 5 a.m. and 9:46 p.m. The interval between trains varies from 13
minutes to two hours, but usually is less than an hour. The trip takes 25
to 35 minutes. Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) runs trains
frequently on the same route from before 7 a.m. until after midnight.
Tickets range from $11 to $37, and the trip takes 25 to 35 minutes.
BWI is served by these airlines: Air Canada, Air Jamaica, Air Tran,
American, British Airways, Continental, Delta, Frontier, Icelandair,
Mexicana, Midwest, North American, Northwest, Pan Am Clipper
Connection, Southwest, United, US Airways, and USA3000. (See the
Quick Concierge at the back of this book for complete listings of 
phone numbers and Web sites.)
Getting the best deal on airfares
Deregulation of the U.S. airline industry has brought a flood of dis-
counted fares to the market. The problem is . . . a flood of different 
fares is on the market. How do you find the best one for you?
If money’s no object, you may choose to fly first class or the less pricey
but still premium business class. If money is an object, but you must buy
a ticket on short notice, you can be stuck with a full-fare coach ticket.
The high cost of full-fare coach — theoretically, the low-cost way to
travel — can be shocking. Susan and I had to travel between D.C. and
Chicago several times on business a few years ago. We were able to plan
several weeks ahead on all but one occasion, and we were able to buy
round-trip tickets for between $200 and $300 each. Once, however, our
client summoned us on short notice, and each ticket cost more than
$1,200 — on the client’s tab, thank goodness.
If you want bargains, then you don’t want plain vanilla coach fares. You
want . . . bargain fares. And you, or your travel agent, have to work a bit
to find the best ones.
Checking many sources to save
Taking full advantage of the magic of computers, airlines now practice
what is called yield management. Ticket prices are adjusted day-by-day —
hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute — based on what the computer knows
about the history of ticket-purchasing on a particular flight and how
sales are going right now. The goal is to fill the plane and sell every
Chapter 5: Getting to Washington, D.C. 47

ticket at the highest possible price. That means you’re not going to get a
bargain on a flight that’s heading toward a sellout. But, because the air-
line wants to fill every seat — the seat’s always there, and if no one’s in
it, it’s not producing any income — you can find cut-rate fares on flights
in danger of taking off without a full load.
The way for you to take advantage of this system is to check every pos-
sible source of information about ticket prices and to keep your travel
plans as flexible as possible. That’s because studies have shown that the
cheapest ticket doesn’t always show up in the same information source.
To maximize your chances of finding it, you need to telephone the air-
lines, visit their Internet sites, check for newspaper ads, call a travel
agent, and visit online travel agencies as well.
Finding bargains on the Internet
If contacting multiple sources is more hassle than you’re willing to
endure and you’re comfortable on the Internet, checking several Web
sites probably is your best bet. Visit a couple online travel agencies,
such as Travelocity (travelocity.com), Expedia (expedia.com), and
Orbitz (orbitz.com). (Canadian travelers should try www.expedia.ca
and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents can go for expedia.co.uk
and opodo.co.uk.) For last-minute trips, Site59 (www.site59.com) in
the United States and LastMinute (www.lastminute.com) often have
better deals than the major-label sites.
Finally, visit the Web sites of the airlines that the online agencies say
have the lowest fares to see whether you can get them even lower. Check
the sites of airlines that you know fly the route you want to travel. And,
if you try to collect miles in a particular frequent-flier program, check
that airline’s Web site, too.
Start your search as early as possible, but check back at the last minute
as well; prices can drop on flights that aren’t selling well. At the airlines’
and travel agencies’ Web sites, you can register for e-mail notices that
alert you to last-minute deals on routes you specify or on any routes in
case you may find one tempting.
If you can be flexible about travel dates or time of day, you increase 
your chances of finding the best bargain. Be alert for packages that save
money by combining airline, hotel, and other reservations in a single
purchase.
Be aware that the cheapest tickets are likely to carry the stiffest 
restrictions — no refunds and high penalties for making changes 
in your itinerary.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, Price-
line (www.priceline.com) offers low prices in exchange for travel on a
“mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious
change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-known
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
48

carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to Chicago
via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m.
flight are pretty high. Note: In 2004, Priceline added nonopaque service
to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times, and
airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Another online travel service is SideStep (www.sidestep.com). It pur-
ports to “search 140 sites at once” and allows you to open a browser and
purchase flights from the sites that they search. The advantage is that it
searches low-cost airlines — such as Southwest — while other online
travel agencies do not.
Some airlines offer discounts to older passengers. If you think you may
qualify, be sure to ask. The discounts may not apply to the lowest fares,
however, so it still pays to search. Southwest Airlines is notable for offer-
ing senior discounts on its already low fares.
Many airlines offer free tickets to children younger than two who don’t
occupy a seat. I urge you to think carefully about the implications of this
arrangement before you take advantage of it. There’s a reason that air-
planes have seat belts and that the pilot urges you to keep your seat belt
fastened when you’re not standing in line at the potty. Things — including
passengers — can get thrown around the cabin if the plane runs into tur-
bulence, and sometimes the turbulence is unexpected. Picture your
child flying out of your lap in that situation. The Federal Aviation
Administration recommends that children who weigh less than 40 pounds
ride in an approved child safety seat (car seat) that is properly belted
into the airplane seat. Make sure that your safety seat is labeled “certi-
fied for use in motor vehicles and aircraft.” To encourage this practice,
some airlines offer discounted tickets for children younger than two.
To give your kids — and you! — a little more room on your flight,
request seats behind the bulkhead. You’ll have to store all your bags in
the overhead bins, however, because you won’t have a seat in front of
you to place them under.
Adults can get more leg room by asking for a seat in the emergency exit
row. Usually you can’t do this till you arrive at the airport, and some air-
lines now are charging extra for the extra space.
Getting to D.C. without Leaving the Ground
You don’t have to fly into Washington. D.C.’s railway station is a tourist
attraction in its own right. The bus probably is the cheapest way to get
here. And you can always drive, although dealing with your car once you
arrive can be a major headache.
Chapter 5: Getting to Washington, D.C. 49

Riding the rails
Whenever I travel up the East Coast, as far as New York, I take the train.
Rail tickets aren’t necessarily cheaper than airfare, but the train is soooo
much more pleasant. The seats are bigger and much more comfortable.
You can walk about with ease. You can sit at a table in the club car and
eat, or play cards, or have a cup of coffee or beer while spreading the
newspaper out before you. You can work, if you’re so inclined. You
arrive at and depart D.C. right on Capitol Hill. Union Station — built at
the beginning of the 20th century in the heyday of rail travel — is a mar-
velous place, with Metrorail and tour-bus stations inside and a taxi stand
outside. The food court has a huge selection of places where you can
buy great eats for the trip. Whenever the Price family goes to New York
for an outing, the vacation starts as the train pulls out, and we picnic on
food we bought at the station.
The trip between New York and Washington takes from about 2 hours
and 45 minutes to 3 hours and 30 minutes, depending on which train you
choose. The Acela Express is faster and more comfortable than the
garden variety trains that make more stops along the way. In my experi-
ence, the premium service isn’t worth the premium price. Like the air-
lines, Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) offers special deals.
Except for weekday Acela service, up to two children ages 2 to 15 can
ride for half price with a paying adult, and one younger child can ride
free on an adult’s lap. Students and veterans can buy discount cards.
Discounts also are offered to riders 62 or older, military personnel, and
members of some organizations, such as AAA or AARP.
In the Washington–New York corridor, train travel can be faster than
flying. You can arrive minutes before the train departs the station. You
travel from and to the heart of each city. It’s a rare day when rain, fog, 
or snow disrupts the schedule. You can catch a train in the Boston-
Washington corridor just about any time you want. Service from else-
where is less frequent and not competitive with air travel in terms 
of time.
Taking a car
I live in D.C. Therefore, I drive in D.C. But you don’t have to, and I advise
you not to.
Driving to D.C. is another issue. For a family, it can be less expensive
than air or rail travel, and some people just prefer to drive. The traffic
on the region’s highways is horrendous, especially at rush hour (which
starts earlier and ends later with each passing day). But once you’re in
town, you can park your car and leave it alone until you’re ready to go
home. However, be aware that parking fees tend to be as horrendous as
the traffic, often $20 or more per day. When you make your reservation,
ask your hotel whether it offers parking and what it charges. Make sure
that you’re sitting down when you ask this question.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
50

If you’re driving to Washington, you may save money by booking a sub-
urban hotel that offers free parking and is near a Metrorail station. It
may take you longer to get to your first sightseeing stop of the day, but
Metro remains fast and cheap, even from the farthest suburb. From
Shady Grove, at one end of the Red Line in suburban Maryland, for
example, the 34-minute trip to Metro Center costs $3.90 in rush hour and
$2.35 at other times. When you’re researching hotels, ask how long it
takes to walk to the Metro station, whether there’s free shuttle service,
or what it costs to take a cab and how easy it is to get one. You can park
at some Metrorail stations, but competition for the spaces is heavy and
starts before the rooster crows.
If you do drive to Washington, you encounter the Capital Beltway (I-495),
which surrounds the city like a medieval moat — filled with raging driv-
ers instead of raging sea monsters. Beware all who enter: There are
speeders, chronic lane-changers, and vicious road-ragers . . . or one
enormous parking lot. Surviving the Beltway is challenge number one.
Challenge number two is to actually get into the city.
Assuming that you’re traveling to Washington on the Interstate Highway
System:
 If you arrive from the northwest, you’ll be on I-270; follow the I-495
signs to Virginia. Immediately after crossing the American Legion
Memorial Bridge into Virginia, take the George Washington Parkway
east to I-66 east. That will take you across the Theodore Roosevelt
Memorial Bridge into Washington on Constitution Avenue near the
Lincoln Memorial.
 From the west, I-66 is a straight shot onto Constitution Avenue.
 From the south, take I-95 to I-395 and then follow signs into
Washington.
 From the northeast on I-95, there is no direct route into town. The
easiest way (using that term loosely) probably is to stay on I-95
south after it merges with I-495, and then take the Baltimore-
Washington Parkway (Maryland Route 295) south to U.S. 50 west,
which runs through the heart of D.C.
 From the east, you’ll probably be on U.S. 50, which you can take
into the middle of town.
Easily accessible on foot and by the Metrorail, Washington is your worst
driving nightmare: confusing traffic circles, often poor signage, and
streets that dead-end and then resume their course farther along. That’s
not to mention scarce and expensive parking. Traffic is heavy from
predawn to post-sunset. One wrong turn in D.C., and you may end up in
Virginia. I had lived in Washington for years — I do mean years! — before
I could consistently negotiate the drive from National Airport to my home
in Upper Northwest without missing a turn and finding myself on a free-
way to Virginia after I had entered the District.
Chapter 5: Getting to Washington, D.C. 51

AAA (% 800-763-9900; www.aaa.com) and some other automobile clubs
offer free maps and driving directions to their members. If you’re a
member, give your club a call.
Riding the bus
For travelers on a tight budget, the bus probably is the cheapest way to
reach D.C. from most cities in the Northeast. Bus fares typically cost less
than half the price of regular train tickets. As I write this book, Peter Pan
(% 800-237-8747; www.peterpanbus.com) and Greyhound (% 800-231-
2222; www.greyhound.com) both were charging $37 for one-way tickets
between Washington and New York.
Both bus lines run express service between Washington and New York
City. Travel time on the express routes is listed at 4 hours and 20 min-
utes, but with good road conditions, the drivers can cut some time off
the run. The D.C. bus terminal, 1005 1st St. NE, is a 4-block walk to the
Union Station Metrorail stop that you would not want to make at night,
so plan on cabbing to your destination if you arrive then.
If you decide to ride the bus to D.C., make sure that you book express
service, or you may end up spending a lot more time on the road than
you expected.
Choosing a Package Tour
Sometimes you can save money by purchasing a package tour. This type
of tour doesn’t mean that you have to follow a guide around town. It’s
simply a way of buying your airfare and accommodations at the same
time. Because the packager buys in bulk, it sometimes can sell to you for
less than you’d pay by shopping on your own. Some packages also
include local transportation, meals, admission to events or attractions,
and local tours.
Prices can vary greatly. Some packages offer a better class of hotel than
others. Some offer the same hotels for lower prices. Some offer flights on
scheduled airlines. Others book charters. In some packages, your choice
of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some let you choose
an escorted tour. Others allow you to add on just a few excursions or
escorted day trips without booking an entirely escorted tour.
The best place to start looking for packages is the travel section of your
local Sunday newspaper or in the nearest major newspaper if your paper
is too small to attract this kind of advertising. You also can find packages
in the back of national travel magazines, at the Internet travel agency
sites, and at the Internet sites of many airlines and hotel chains. The
Internet sites often let you build a package by choosing among hotels,
flight times, and other options. Car rentals are offered, too, but you really
don’t want a car in D.C. unless you plan to use it to leave town.

DRIVING INTO D.C.
If you drive to Washington, ask your hotel for directions.
• From the Northwest: Take I-270, follow I-495 signs to Virginia, go east on George Washington
   Parkway, then go east on I-66, which will take you onto Constitution Ave.
• From the West: Take I-66 onto Constitution Ave.
• From the South: Take I-95, go north on I-395, then follow signs into Washington.
• From the Northeast: Take I-95, then go west on U.S. 50, which becomes New York Ave.
• From the East: Follow U.S. 50 into town.

Chapter 5: Getting to Washington, D.C. 53

Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of
the biggest packagers in the Northeast. American Express Vacations
(% 800-297-2977; www.americanexpress.com/travel) is another
good option. Their Web sites can direct you to the office nearest your
home if you want to meet a travel agent face-to-face.
Airlines also offer packages to varying destinations. If you’ve already
picked your hotel, ask whether it offers land/air packages.
If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the
Better Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go
online at www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, find
another packager.

hen you travel, do you need to find places that interest and
accommodate children? Do you have special interests or needs
related to your age? Do you need to find places with easy access for the
disabled? Do you want to seek out gay-friendly activities and venues?
This chapter is the right spot to find what you’re looking for. And don’t
worry: Washington is friendly to everyone.
Finding Family-Friendly Fun in D.C.
Washington is one of the most family-friendly destinations around.
Those yellow school buses migrate here all year round for good reason:
Class trips to Washington are rites of passage, like braces and pimples.
Many attractions have special sections and programs for children.
Washington’s abundant parkland offers countless places for kids to let
off steam. Restaurants entice the young and restless with kids’ menus or
half-portions, booster seats and high chairs, crayons, coloring books,
and other pacifiers. The best ones offer menus for children that range
far beyond the traditional hot dogs, french fries, and peanut-butter-and-
jelly sandwiches.
When you check hotels, ask about special rates for families and perks
such as free or lower-priced food for kids in hotel restaurants. When you
want some time without the kids, many hotels can link you up with baby
sitters. Ask the concierge.

When you’re traveling with kids, a suite with kitchen facilities can be a
great place to stay. With a refrigerator and microwave, you can eat
breakfast before setting out on your adventures, and you can return for
a midday snack and nap, which is a great way for the little ones to
recharge. Separate sleeping areas — perhaps a bedroom and a living
room with foldout sofas — let your kids enjoy their own space (and TV),
while you relish some peace and privacy. Bring some snacks.
Many Washington attractions offer colorful, age-appropriate workbooks
that enhance youngsters’ visits. Some host family film sessions, work-
shops, and educational programs for children. In museums, ask at the
information desk. Kid-friendly food is available at most museum restau-
rants as well. At National Park Service sites, ask about the Junior Ranger
program.
Some national parks’ Web sites have a button labeled “for kids” that
takes you to information about kid-friendly places and activities.
Washington’s parks are listed at this Web site: data2.itc.nps.gov/
parksearch/state.cfm?st=dc.
Hands-on exploring in D.C.
Children want to do more than look when they’re on vacation. Here’s a
small sampling of the things kids can do in D.C.
 Pet a tarantula (well, kids think it’s cool!) at the National Museum
of Natural History’s insect zoo.
 Touch a moon rock and peer into John Glenn’s Friendship 7 space
capsule at the National Air and Space Museum.
 Attend a family concert at the Kennedy Center and touch the musi-
cal instruments during the “petting zoo” period.
 Ride the carousel on the National Mall.
 Say “hi” to the pandas at the National Zoo.
And that list is just a teeny-tiny sampling.
Frolicking in wide, open spaces
Washington’s parks offer an open invitation for your kids to behave like,
well, kids. They can run around, ride the carousel, or fly a kite on the
mammoth lawn known as the National Mall. If they’d prefer to frolic on
water, your family can rent pedal boats under Mr. Jefferson’s gaze on the
Tidal Basin. Or you can take a hike in the middle of the Potomac River
on Theodore Roosevelt Island. For more detailed information on the
best activities for families, check out Frommer’s Washington, D.C. 
with Kids.

Drafting a plan for your clan
To start your family vacation off right, let your kids get involved in the
planning. They can start by writing to the Washington, D.C., Convention
and Tourism Corp., 901 7th St. NW, 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20001, or
going to the Web site www.washington.org for general information.
The computer-literate can find useful and interesting information at the
Web sites listed throughout this book. In addition to the preceding park
service site, check out:
 Smithsonian Institution for children: smithsonianeducation.
org/students
 White House Web site for kids: www.whitehouse.gov/kids
 National Zoo: natzoo.si.edu
Throughout this book, this Kid Friendly icon marks the best places and
activities for children.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
If you’re a senior citizen, you’re (finally!) eligible for some special bene-
fits when you travel. Senior citizen can be defined as being a lot younger
than many may expect — 50 years old for AARP membership, for exam-
ple, and 55 for many discount programs.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) includes
Washington in its educational tours for travelers 55 and older (and a
spouse or companion of any age). Nine D.C. programs, ranging from one
to five nights, are being offered as I write this book. A one-day program,
organized with the American Foreign Service Association (the profes-
sional association of U.S. diplomats), looks at the United States’ foreign
policy challenges. A six-day program explores the Smithsonian in depth.
Another visits major memorials, monuments, museums, and historic
sites.
Savings for the senior set
As you plan your trip, and after you arrive, always ask whether any
restaurant, lodging, attraction, or form of transport has a senior rate.
Carry identification that shows your age, and you may end up with sig-
nificant savings over your younger counterparts.
You may want to check out the benefits of joining AARP (known as the
American Association of Retired Persons prior to setting its focus on
recruiting baby boomers before they reach retirement age). Various 
discounts are available to AARP members, and local chapters run 
programs — including tours — for members. Information is available 
at % 888-687-2277 or at the AARP Web site at www.aarp.org.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 57

American citizens and permanent residents who are at least 62 can buy a
Golden Age Passport, which gives you lifetime free entrance to all prop-
erties managed by the National Park Service (% 888-467-2757; www.
nps.gov/fees_passes.htm) and some other federal facilities. At places
that charge a per-vehicle fee, the passport admits all passengers. If the
fee is per person, the passport admits you, your spouse, and your chil-
dren. The passports are sold for $10 at park service facilities that charge
an entrance fee. Besides free entry, the passport gets you a 50 percent
discount on federal-use fees charged for such facilities as camping,
swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours, although the discount
sometimes applies only to the pass holder.
Most park service sites in Washington are free anyway. The pass does
save you a few bucks at the Great Falls parks in Maryland and Virginia,
which I recommend for a nearby excursion, and at the Frederick
Douglass National Historic Site.
Here are some additional ways for you to save money just by revealing
your birth date:
 Many hotel chains offer senior discounts. Always ask when making
a reservation. You may have to register and pay a fee to join a sen-
iors club.
 Although most U.S. airlines no longer routinely offer lower fares to
older travelers, you still can find special deals for seniors. American
(% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com) offers lower fares to 65-and-older
travelers on some flights, for example. United (% 800-720-1765;
www.silverwingsplus.com) has created a “Silver Wings Plus” pro-
gram for those who are at least 55, but it costs $240 a year. Southwest
(% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com) offers discounts on its
already usually low fares to travelers 65 and older. So, when you
book your flight, it pays to ask.
 Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) travelers ages 62 and
older receive a 15 percent discount on most train tickets and 10
percent off the North America Rail Pass for 30 days worth of travel
in the United States and Canada. The discount doesn’t apply to
weekday Acela Express service, to sleeper accommodations, or on
the Auto Train between Washington’s Northern Virginia suburbs
and Florida.
 Seniors 65 and older can buy half-price Metrorail fare cards in the
Metro Center Station ticket office (12th and F streets NW) and at
many stores, including Safeway and Giant grocery stores. You also
can ride buses for 50¢. In both cases, you must provide some proof
of your age (driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport).
Asking about senior discounts pays off, even if you don’t consider your-
self to be a senior citizen. You don’t necessarily have to be 65. Many
establishments — restaurants, theaters, and museums — offer discounts
at age 62, while some even begin as early as age 55.

More senior resources
For more information on senior traveling, check out these publications:
the magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.travel50andbeyond.com), and
the book Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50 (McGraw-Hill), by Joann
Rattner Heilman.
Traveling without Barriers: 
D.C. for the Disabled
Washington is a highly accessible city for disabled visitors, and all major
transportation providers offer services to help the disabled traveler get
here in the first place.
To scope things out, check out Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-
2979; www.access-able.com). The Web site lists travel agents who
have experience serving individuals with disabilities and provides some
information about accessibility to lodging, transportation, and attrac-
tions for major cities around the world, including D.C. It also provides
leads for renting wheelchairs and other health-care equipment.
Getting to, and around, town
Tell your air, rail, or bus carrier ahead of time if you need any assistance —
both when you make your reservation and again when you check in at
the airport or station. If you travel with a Seeing Eye dog or other serv-
ice animal, ask about rules for taking it with you.
If you need special accommodations or assistance, Amtrak asks you to
make your reservation by telephone (% 800-872-7245) or at a ticket
counter, rather than online. The railroad also operates text telephone
service (TDD/TTY) from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern time at % 800-523-6590.
If you need accessible sleeping accommodations on an overnight train,
Amtrak suggests you reserve at least 14 days before your trip. The rail-
road makes all bedrooms available to all passengers after that time.
Amtrak offers discounted fares to disabled passengers. You must pur-
chase tickets by phone or at a ticket counter, and you must show docu-
mentation of your disability at the ticket counter and when boarding the
train. Acceptable documentation includes a transit system disability ID
card, a membership card from a disabilities organization, or a letter from
a physician.
If you require the assistance of a personal care attendant and provide
notice 24 hours in advance, Greyhound (% 800-752-4841; www.
greyhound.com) lets the attendant travel for half fare. If you’re 
traveling alone and alert Greyhound 48 hours prior to your travel, 
the company can arrange assistance along your route.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 59

The National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that is essen-
tially the same as the Golden Age Passport described earlier in this
chapter in the section “Savings for the senior set.” The access passport
is free to citizens or permanent residents who are visually impaired or
permanently disabled, regardless of age. You can get one at a park serv-
ice facility that charges a fee by showing proof of medically determined
disability and eligibility for receiving benefits under federal law. In addi-
tion to the benefits conferred by the Golden Age Passport, the Golden
Access Passport covers admission for a care assistant if you travel with
one. You can get more information at % 888-467-2757 or www.nps.
gov/fees_passes.htm.
Visitors with disabilities find Metrorail an excellent way to get around
D.C. Every station has elevators, as well as fare-card vending machines,
entrance gates, and telephones, all built to accommodate wheelchairs.
For the hearing-impaired, blinking lights along the edge of the track
announce the arrival of trains, and (for everyone’s convenience) newly
installed announcement signs give information about the approaching
train. A bumpy surface has been placed along platform edges to help the
vision-impaired locate the edge. Elevator control panels and signs in the
stations contain Braille. On the train, bells chime and announcements
occur when the doors are about to open or close, and the driver
announces each station. All Metrobuses kneel for easier access, and
almost all have low floor ramp or a lift. The TTY number for Metro 
information is % 202-638-3780.
Metro gives passengers with disabilities the same discounts available to
seniors, but they must possess valid proof of disability. If the individual
doesn’t already have a Medicare card, however, the discount probably
isn’t worth the paperwork for someone who’s visiting for a few days or
even a few weeks.
Unfortunately, Metrorail’s elevators are notorious for breaking down, a
minor inconvenience for most passengers but a major problem for
anyone with a mobility problem. (Metro management was severely
embarrassed a few years ago when a frustrated man in a wheelchair —
who had encountered several out-of-service elevators — screamed an
obscenity and was ticketed. Management quickly apologized, tore up the
ticket, and gave the man complimentary passes.) When entering the
Metrorail system, ask the attendant whether elevators are working at
your destination. You can also call % 202-962-1212 for information on
elevator outages. When elevators are out, Metro provides shuttle buses
to serve those stations. Ask the attendant where to catch them.
All Tourmobile trams are accessible to passengers who can climb two
or three steps. The company also has vehicles with wheelchair lifts
which must be ordered in advance. For information, call % 703-979-
0690. City Scooter Tours (% 888-441-7575; www.cityscootertours.
com) rents and offers guided tours of the Mall and Tidal Basin areas on
sit-upon powered “mobility scooters.”

Building accessibility
The Smithsonian Institution’s museums, as well as most other public
museums and attractions, are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
Many films aired in museum theaters offer narrated audiotapes for the
vision-impaired. Most live theaters have infrared headsets for the vision-
and hearing-impaired. Live productions often feature at least one signed
performance during the run. Call the theater for specifics. Some older
facilities are less accessible than the newer ones, but that’s far from uni-
versal. The best bet is to call ahead to make sure that the facility can
accommodate your needs.
The Smithsonian, including the Zoo, offers many accommodations to visi-
tors with disabilities. Get information at www.si.edu/visit/visitors_
with_disabilities.htm. The Smithsonian’s central information
number is % 202-633-1000 (TTY 202-633-5285). Service animals and
power scooters are permitted in all Smithsonian facilities. Most exhibi-
tion videos are captioned or have scripts available. You can get scripts
for audio tours. Manual wheelchairs can be borrowed for free on a first-
come, first-served basis at information desks. Companion-care rest-
rooms are available at the National Air and Space Museum, National
Museum of Natural History, and Hirshhorn Museum, and more are
planned.
You may find that some old properties, historic inns, and bed-and-
breakfasts are inaccessible, but most major D.C. hotels and restaurants
are. Ask specifically when you make a reservation. If you book through a
travel agency or tour group, be sure to make your needs known.
For more information
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include Moss-
Rehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of 
accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for Accessible Travel
and Hospitality) (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership
fees: $49 adults, $29 students and seniors 63 and older), which offers a
wealth of travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed rec-
ommendations on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour 
operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services; and the American
Foundation for the Blind (AFB) (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a
referral resource for the blind or visually impaired that includes informa-
tion on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs.
Also check out the quarterly magazine Emerging Horizons ($16.95 per
year, $21.95 outside the U.S.; www.emerginghorizons.com).
Resources for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Washington has a large and vibrant gay and lesbian community, so 
the city is a welcoming place for GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 61

transgender) visitors. Just ask our two gay City Council members, one of
whom was a Republican until he turned independent to protest the GOP’s
“indifference, intolerance, and injustice.” The traditional center of gay life
is Dupont Circle, but gay and lesbian Washingtonians are thoroughly inte-
grated into neighborhoods throughout the city. Gay and lesbian tourists
are likely to be made welcome wherever they decide to visit.
Gathering gay and lesbian information 
about Washington
The prime source of news for and about D.C.’s gay community is the
Washington Blade (www.washingtonblade.com), a weekly newspaper
that’s been hitting the streets here since 1969. It’s filled with local,
national, and international news, plus information about entertainment
and community resources. It’s widely available for free throughout 
the city.
Washington’s premier gay and lesbian bookstore is Lambda Rising, at
1625 Connecticut Ave. NW (% 202-462-6969; www.lambdarising.com).
The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay-rights political
action organization, operates an Action Center and Store at 1629
Connecticut Ave. NW (% 202-232-8621).
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com): Spartacus International Gay Guide (Bruno
Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide), a good guide-
book focused on gay men, and the Damron guides (www.damron.com),
with separate annual books for gay men and lesbians.
Getting to and staying in D.C. the gay-friendly way
Many travel agencies offer tours and itineraries specifically for gay 
and lesbian travelers. The International Gay and Lesbian Travel
Association (IGLTA) (% 800-448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org)
is the trade association for the industry and offers an online directory of
gay-friendly travel businesses. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-
2681; www.abovebeyondtours.com) offers tours and independent
travel arrangements for gay travelers. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951;
www.nowvoyager.com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned
and -operated travel service.

Among the gay-friendly hotels listed by IGLTA are:
 Hotel Helix. 1430 Rhode Island Ave. NW. Metro: Farragut North or
McPherson Square (% 202-462-9001 or 800-706-1202; www.hotel
helix.com).
 Hotel Madera. 1310 New Hampshire Ave. Metro: Dupont Circle 
(% 202-296-7600 or 800-430-1202; www.hotelmadera.com). See
Chapter 9.
 Hotel Rouge. 1315 16th St. NW. Metro: Dupont Circle (% 202-232-
8000 or 800-738-1202; www.rougehotel.com). See Chapter 9.
 Topaz Hotel. 1733 N St. NW. Metro: Dupont Circle (% 202-393-3000
or 800-775-1202; www.topazhotel.com).
For really special accommodations, make a reservation at the D.C. Guest
House (1337 10th St. NW 20001; Metro: Mt. Vernon Square; % 202-332-
2502; www.dcguesthouse.com), a recently renovated 1876 mansion.
Gourmet breakfast is served in an elegant dining room. You’ll feel like
guests in a home because this place is lovingly restored and operated by
four friends who spread their personal, eclectic tastes throughout the
truly stunning mansion.

“A
re we there yet?” Well, not quite. But after I share with you a
few more details, you’ll be ready to stick your plans in your
pocket and begin enjoying D.C.
Renting a Car — Not!
I live in D.C. Therefore, I drive in D.C. But you don’t have to, and I advise
you not to. (See Chapter 5 for reasons why you don’t want to get behind
the wheel.) Ask all who live here. They’ll tell you that, even with the grid
system, getting from place to place can be confusing, and the cost of
parking can take a large chunk out of your budget. You can rely on shut-
tle, taxi, bus, or rail service from the airport or train station. Use Metro-
rail and your own two feet for sightseeing — or buses and taxis when
necessary.
If you decide you really want or need to drive despite my warnings, see
the next section.
Getting the best rental rate
If you insist on renting a car, keep in mind that car-rental rates vary
widely. The price depends on many factors: the size of the car, the
length of time you keep it, where and when you pick it up and drop it off,
where you go in it, and a host of other factors. Asking the following key
questions can save you big bucks:

 Is the weekend rate lower than the weekday rate? Ask whether
the rate is the same for a Friday morning pickup as it is for one on
Thursday night. If you keep the car five or more days, a weekly rate
may be cheaper than the daily rate.
 Are you charged a drop-off fee if you return the car to a location
that’s different from where you picked it up? If, for example,
you’re leaving town from a different airport from the one you
arrived at or you’re driving to another city in a rental car, the com-
pany may tack on a hefty charge to leave it in a location other than
the original pickup point.
 Is the rate cheaper if you pick up the car at the airport instead of
a location in town? One location may be more practical than the
other, so don’t forget to factor convenience into your decision.
 Do you get a special rate for being a member of AAA, AARP, 
frequent-flier programs, or other organizations? Such member-
ships can get you discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Can you have the discounted rate you saw advertised in the local
newspaper? Be sure to ask for that specific rate; otherwise, you
may be charged the standard (higher) rate.
 Is age an issue? Many car-rental companies add on a fee for drivers
younger than 25, while some don’t rent to younger drivers at all.
Adding up the costs of renting a car
On top of the standard rental prices, you need to watch out for other
charges that may be applied. The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)
absolves you of responsibility to pay for damage to the vehicle in
exchange for a hefty daily fee. Check with your auto insurance agent and
the credit-card company you use to rent the car. You’re probably already
covered.
Car-rental companies also may try to sell you liability insurance (to
cover you if you harm others in an accident), additional liability insur-
ance (to increase the coverage you already have), personal accident
insurance (to cover injury to yourself or your passengers), and personal
effects insurance (to cover possessions that you carry in the rental car).
If you don’t know whether you’re already covered, check with your auto
and homeowner’s insurance agent(s). You may not need to purchase
this extra coverage. If your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals,
however, or if you don’t have auto insurance, definitely consider the
additional coverage. Ask the car-rental agent to explain it to you thor-
oughly and make sure that you understand the explanation. Unless
you’re toting around the Hope diamond — and you don’t want to leave
that in your car trunk anyway — you probably can skip the personal
effects insurance. But driving around without liability or personal acci-
dent coverage is never a good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other
people may not be, and liability claims can be complicated.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

Some rental-car companies also offer refueling packages, which means
that you pay for an entire tank of gas up front and don’t face extra
charges if you fail to return the car with a full tank. This service may be
convenient, but the best way to save money is to fill the tank yourself at
a gas station just before you return to the rental lot. The refueling pack-
age makes sense only if you routinely run late and face penalty charges
for returning the car without a full tank.
Frequent fliers can cheer themselves up with the knowledge that most
car rentals are worth at least 500 miles in their frequent-flier accounts.
Be sure to show your card.
Booking a rental car on the Internet
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can 
make comparison-shopping and renting a car much easier. The major
online travel agencies — such as Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter
Living (www.smarterliving.com) — have search engines that dig up
discounted car-rental rates. Enter the size of the car you want, the
pickup and return dates, and the city where you want to rent, and you’ll
be quoted prices. Pick the deal you want and make your reservation at
the site. As with buying airline tickets, checking the car-rental compa-
nies’ sites can pay off, too.
Travel and Medical Insurance: 
To Buy or Not to Buy?
Three primary kinds of travel insurance are available: trip cancellation,
lost luggage, and medical. Trip cancellation insurance is a good idea for
some people, but lost luggage and additional medical insurance don’t
make sense for most travelers. Be sure to explore your options and con-
sider the following insurance advice before you leave home:
 Trip cancellation insurance. If you pay a large portion of expensive
vacation costs up front, consider purchasing this type of insurance.
When you buy a package tour, insurance comes in handy if the
packager or tour company defaults, a member of your party
becomes ill, or (heaven forbid!) you experience a death in the
family and aren’t able to go on vacation. You probably won’t be
reimbursed if you cancel your trip just because you change your
mind. Reasons that qualify for reimbursement can range from sick-
ness to natural disasters to the State Department declaring your
destination unsafe for travel. Insurers usually don’t cover general
fear — as many travelers discovered when they tried to cancel
trips in October 2001 because they were wary of flying.
Note: Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
66

convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure that the tour company is a reputable one,
however. Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from
your tour or cruise company, saying it’s better to buy from a “third-
party” insurer than to put all your money in one place.
 Lost luggage insurance. Your homeowner’s insurance should cover
stolen luggage if your policy encompasses off-premises theft. Check
your existing policies or ask your insurance agent before you buy
any additional coverage. Airlines are responsible for up to $2,500 for
checked luggage they lose on domestic flights. If you plan to check
items more valuable than the standard liability — and if your valu-
ables aren’t covered by your homeowner’s policy — get baggage
insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package
or buy “BagTrak” from Travel Guard (see listing later in this sec-
tion). Don’t buy insurance at the airport, because it’s usually over-
priced. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with
you in your carry-on luggage, as many valuables (including books,
money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
 Medical insurance. If you get sick while on vacation, your existing
health insurance should cover your expenses. But keep in mind that
some HMOs may differ on the benefits they offer while you travel.
You may want to review your policy or ask your agent before leaving
home, especially if you’re coming to Washington from overseas.
If you think you need additional insurance, make sure that you
don’t pay for more coverage than you need. You also should call
around to find a good deal on insurance. Here are some reputable
issuers of travel insurance:
• Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com)
• Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com)
• Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travel
insured.com)
• Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.
travelex-insurance.com)
Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a credit card.
By law, consumers can get their money back on goods and services not
received if they report the loss within 60 days after the charge is listed
on their credit card statement.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

Staying Healthy When You Travel
If you suffer from a chronic illness, consult your doctor before your
departure. For conditions like epilepsy, diabetes, or heart problems,
wear a MedicAlert Identification Tag (% 888-633-4298 or 209-668-3333;
www.medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condi-
tion and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-
hour hotline.
Most health insurance policies cover you if you get sick away from 
home — but check, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO or traveling
from overseas. Always carry your insurance ID card with you.
Pack prescription medications in your carry-on luggage and carry pre-
scription medications in their original containers with labeling showing
they were prescribed for you. Also bring along copies of your prescrip-
tions in case you lose your pills or run out. And don’t forget sunglasses
and an extra pair of contact lenses or prescription glasses.
CVS (www.cvs.com), Washington’s major drugstore chain (with more
than 40 D.C. area locations), has three stores with 24-hour pharmacies
near tourist-frequented neighborhoods:
 Dupont Circle: 6 Dupont Circle NW (Metro: Dupont Circle; % 202-
785-1466)
 West End: 2240 M St. NW (Metro: Dupont Circle; % 202-296-9876
pharmacy, 202-296-9877 main)
 Upper Northwest: 4555 Wisconsin Ave. NW (Metro: Tenleytown; 
% 202-537-1587)
If you need immediate medical attention, head for the emergency 
room at one of the following District hospitals. In a true emergency, 
call % 911 for an ambulance. If it’s not an emergency and you drive, 
call for directions.
 Children’s National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Ave. NW, Upper
Northwest (% 202-884-5000)
 George Washington University Hospital, 900 23rd St. NW, down-
town (% 202-715-4911)
 Georgetown University Hospital, 3800 Reservoir Rd. NW, George-
town (% 202-444-2119)
 Sibley Hospital, 5255 Longboro Rd. NW, Upper Northwest (% 202-
537-4000)
 Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving St. NW, Upper Northwest
(% 202-877-7000)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
68

Washington’s hospitals also can refer you to a physician if you don’t
really need emergency room care. Try calling one of the following hospi-
tals for a referral:
 George Washington University Hospital (% 888-449-3627)
 Georgetown University Hospital (% 202-342-2400)
 Sibley Hospital (% 202-537-4638)
 Washington Hospital Center (% 202-877-3627)
If you need a dentist, call the District of Columbia Dental Society Referral
Service (% 202-547-7615).
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis — or, as it’s known in the world of flying, economy-
class syndrome — is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a
potentially deadly condition that can be caused by sitting in cramped
conditions, such as an airplane cabin, for too long. During a flight (espe-
cially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch your legs every
60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventative meas-
ures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of
water, and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of
deep vein thrombosis, heart disease, or other condition that puts you at
high risk, some experts recommend wearing compression stockings or
taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask your physician about the
best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain
or swelling, or even shortness of breath.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
It used to be that travelers wondered if their hotel room would have a
phone and if they should use a pay phone anyway to save money. Now it
seems everyone travels with a cellphone and an e-mail account, and the
question becomes whether your cellphone works in a strange city and
where you can find Internet access.
Using a cellphone across the United States
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in Washington. But
take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out. If you need to stay in touch at a destination where
you know your phone won’t work, you can rent a phone that does from
InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or at a
rental-car location. Beware that rates can be steep.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be happy to know that GSM
(Global System for Mobiles) service is available in Washington. But, to
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

be safe, you should ask your wireless provider whether your phone will
work here.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have many ways to check the Internet and e-mail on the road.
Using your own laptop or hand-held device gives you the most flexibility.
A growing number of hotels offer Internet access in rooms or at a busi-
ness center — or by wireless anywhere in the facility. Ask about charges
first, or you may be unpleasantly surprised at check-out time. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
You also can take advantage of a growing number of cybercafes, where
you can go online while you sip a beverage or nibble at lunch, often for 
a fee. At Kramerbooks & Afterwards (1517 Connecticut Ave. NW, just
above Dupont Circle; % 202-387-1400; www.kramers.com), you can
check e-mail for free at the bar. Many Starbucks offer wireless Internet
access. You can search for other Washington cybercafes at www.cyber
captive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
All D.C. public libraries (% 202-727-0321; www.dclibrary.org) offer
free Internet access. The main library is the downtown Martin Luther
King Library (901 G St. NW at 9th Street; % 202-727-0321). The West
End Branch (% 202-724-8707) is at 1101 24th St. NW at L Street. The
Georgetown Branch (% 202-282-0220) is at 3260 R St. NW at Wisconsin
Avenue. On Capitol Hill, the Southeast Branch (% 202-698-3377) is at
403 7th St. SE at D Street. Call for hours, which vary.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). Your home ISP may be able to
forward your e-mail to the Web-based account automatically.
Some Internet Service Providers (ISP) have local access numbers
around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing a local
call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask 
how you can use your current account in Washington, and how much it
will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, you can get
Internet access through i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.
i2roam.com).
Bring your own connection kit — extension electric cord, phone cord,
and Ethernet cable — or find out if your hotel supplies them to guests.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided that your “target” PC is on
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Washington, D.C. 
70

and has an always-on connection to the Internet. The service offers top-
quality security, but if you’re worried about hackers, use your own
laptop rather than a public computer to access the GoToMyPC system.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
Post-9/11 security procedures have made flying a lot less fun than it
used to be. Generally, you’re fine if you arrive at the airport one hour
before a domestic flight and two hours before an international flight.
Add at least another half hour to work your way through Dulles, maybe
an extra hour if you’re checking bags. If you’re in line and worrying that
you might miss your flight, tell an airline employee and you’ll probably
be moved up in line if necessary.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID ready to show at check-in, the security check-
point, and sometimes even the gate. (Children younger than 18 don’t
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. In addition, E-tickets have made paper
tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-
counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in
from your home computer. Online check-in involves logging on to your
airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing your board-
ing pass — airlines even offer you bonus miles when you do so! If you’re
using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you used to book the
ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print your boarding pass from the
kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and
a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat,
you’ll be able to do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller air-
lines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure that these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is
also a good way to avoid lines, although not all airlines offer it; call
before you go.
Repeated changes in airport security rules can confuse passengers and
lead to long checkpoint lines. If you have trouble standing for long peri-
ods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline can provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up your trip through security by removing all metal items
(keys, watches, jewelry, coins, buttons, hair decorations, large belt buck-
les, cellphones, and so on) from your pockets and your body and placing
them in you carry-on bag. Don’t wear a bra with metal wiring. If you’ve
got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat
with the security screeners.
At the metal detector, you’ll have to remove your shoes and coats and put
them in a bin for examination by the X-ray machine. If you haven’t put
your metal items in your luggage, you’ll have to put them in a bin as well.
If you carry liquids, gels or aerosols on board (mouthwash, toothpaste,
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

deodorant, shaving cream, and so forth) they must be in 3-ounce or
smaller containers. And all of them must be placed in a single, quart-size,
zip-top, clear plastic bag. The bag must be placed on the X-ray conveyor
belt or in a bin.
You can bring larger amounts of prescription and over-the-counter med-
ications as well as other liquids, gels, and aerosols that are medically
necessary, including prosthetics. You can bring baby formula or breast
milk if you are traveling with the baby or small child who consumes it.
These need to be separated from other items and declared to a security
screener.
If you’re carrying a laptop computer, you must take it out of its carrying
case and place it on the X-ray conveyer belt.
You cannot take other liquids, gels, or aerosols — such as coffee or soft
drinks — past the screening area. You can by them in the secure area,
then carry them onto the plane with you.
The list of prohibited items is long but based on common sense: things
you could use to hurt other people, especially sharp objects and items
you could wield like a weapon. In other words, no knives, scissors with
blades longer than 4 inches, baseball bats, ski poles, guns, ammunition,
hatchets, hammers, screw drivers more than 7 inches long, brass knuck-
les, martial arts weapons, explosives, fuels . . . you get the picture.
Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item,” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in
it, it’s still considered a personal item.
Airport screeners may decide to search your checked luggage by hand.
You can purchase luggage locks that allow screeners to open and relock
a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary. Look for Travel Sentry cer-
tified locks at luggage or travel shops and Brookstone stores (you can
buy them online at www.brookstone.com). Luggage inspectors can use
a special code or key to open these locks, which are approved by the
TSA. For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org. If
you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut
off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search your luggage.
Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security,
except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children. If you’re an
escort, you have to get a pass at the check-in counter.
For the latest word on all airport security rules, visit the Transportation
Security Administration’s Web site at www.tsa.gov.

Part III
Settling into
Washington, D.C.

In this part . . . 
I
n this part, you get into the real details: Washington’s best
hotels (and a few runners-up), the best restaurants, and
the best places to catch a quick snack or have a drink with a
capital view. Because you need to know how to get to all
these great places, I also give you the lowdown on D.C.’s
spectacular subway system, comprehensive network of bus
routes, confusing taxi fares, and state-themed avenues (on
which you should never, ever drive).

Chapter 8
Arriving and Getting
Oriented
In This Chapter
 Arriving in Washington by plane, train, or auto
 Discovering Washington’s neighborhoods
 Acquiring visitor information
 Making your way around town
You can get to Washington easily by train or plane and, in a sense, 
by automobile. Once you’re here, a car is not the best bet for local
transportation — D.C.’s world-class Metrorail system is. After you settle
in, you’ll discover that Washington’s most interesting neighborhoods are
fairly close to each other and easy to navigate.
Finding the Way to Your Hotel
The train takes you right to Capitol Hill, where Union Station is an easy
cab or subway ride away from the hotels that are most attractive to
tourists. National Airport is nearly as convenient, but you’ll face a bit of
a trek from Dulles or Baltimore/Washington International.
Signs for taxis and other ground transportation are posted in the air-
ports’ baggage claim areas, as well as outside the terminals. Taxis stop
at Union Station’s main front doors. At National Airport and Union
Station, you also see signs to on-site Metrorail stations.
From Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
National is Washington’s most convenient airport. It’s close to town, is
easy to get around, and has terrific transportation connections. It’s also
an attraction in its own right, thanks to the eye-popping terminal that
opened in 1997. The new terminal has been divided in half and given the
names Terminal A and Terminal B. The old terminal is called C.
Two information desks are located on the main concourse in the new
terminal, and one is near the baggage claim area of the old terminal.

ATMs are on the main concourses in the old and new terminals and in
the baggage claim area of the new terminal. Currency exchange serv-
ices are offered at two customer service centers in the new terminal’s
main concourse.
Before you leave home, find out whether your hotel offers complimentary
shuttle service. If not, the cheapest and quickest way into town is Metro-
rail. You pay $1.35 ($1.55 in rush hour) for a 12-minute ride on Metrorail’s
Yellow Line from National to the Archives-Navy Memorial Station, which 
is about halfway between the White House and the Capitol. The trip to
Metro Center takes about 18 minutes and costs an extra dime in rush hour
because you have to change trains or take a long loop on the Blue Line.
Rush-hour fares are charged on weekdays before 9:30 a.m. and from 3 to 
7 p.m. You also pay the surcharge when the trains run after 2 a.m. Usually
trains run from 5 a.m. till midnight Monday through Thursday, 5 a.m. to 
3 a.m. Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday, and 7 a.m. until midnight Sunday.
Hours may vary on holidays and during special events.
A taxi to downtown costs about $11 to $12 (before tip) and takes about
15 minutes (depending, of course, on Washington’s notorious traffic).
To avoid price gouging, ask for the fare before you get in a cab. D.C. cabs
don’t have meters. (The suburban cabs do.) Fares are calculated accord-
ing to an arcane zone system, which is displayed on a nearly indecipher-
able map in the cab’s back seat. To be safe, ask your hotel ahead of time
to estimate the fare from the airport. Allow plenty of time to get to the
airport for your return flight if you travel weekdays from 6 to 10 a.m. 
and 3 to 8 p.m. For more information on taxi fares, see Chapter 4.
From Dulles International Airport
Dulles is in suburban Virginia, about 26 miles from downtown D.C. To get
into town, pick from the following options.
 The cab ride to downtown Washington takes about 45 minutes in
favorable traffic and costs about $55.
 The SuperShuttle van (% 202-296-6662 or 800-258-3826; www.
supershuttle.com) charges $22 for the first passenger, $10 for
each companion.
 The best bargain is the 5A express Metrobus, which runs from
Dulles to L’Enfant Plaza near the National Mall in D.C. or to Rosslyn,
Virginia, just across the river from Georgetown. At both stops, you
can enter the Metrorail system or hail a taxi. The bus costs $3. It
departs Dulles every 40 to 50 minutes from 5:50 a.m. to 11:40 p.m.
on weekdays, and hourly from 6:32 a.m. to 11:40 p.m. weekends.
Dulles’s ATMs are on both levels of the main terminal and on mid-
field concourses A, B, C, and D. Currency exchange services are
located on the upper level of the main terminal and on midfield
concourses B, C, and D. An information counter is on the lower
level of the main terminal.

Getting into town from the Airports
• From Dulles International Airport:
   Take the Dulles Airport access road (the only road out) to I-66 east through the Virginia
   suburbs and over the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge (still I-66), which lands you on Constitution
   Avenue and the western edge of the national Mall near the Lincoln Memorial.
• From Baltimore Washington International Airport:
   Take the airport access road to Highway 295 (Gladys Spellman Parkway; also known as the
   Baltimore-Washington Parkway) south to Route 50 west (New York Avenue).
• From Reagan National Airport:
   Take the George Washington Memorial Parkway north to the 14th Street Bridge, 
   which dumps you onto…14th Street! Just follow the signs to Washington.

Washington, D.C., Airports
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

From Baltimore/Washington International Airport
BWI often has the least expensive airfares. But it’s also the farthest away
from the heart of D.C., so getting from the airport to your hotel takes
longer and costs more money.
By cab, you’re 45 to 60 minutes and $60 to $65 away from downtown
Washington if the traffic flows smoothly. The SuperShuttle (% 800-258-
3826; www.supershuttle.com) van service charges $31 for the first pas-
senger and $11 for each companion.
As at Dulles, Metrobus runs a $3 express from BWI — this one to the
Greenbelt Metrorail station. The B30 bus leaves the airport every 40
minutes between 6:58 a.m. and 10:50 p.m. weekdays and 9:38 a.m. to
10:48 p.m. weekends. From the Greenbelt station, the Metrorail ride to
Penn Quarter costs between $2.35 and $3.05 and takes about 25 minutes.
On weekdays, you also can ride the MARC train (% 800-325-7245;
www.mtamaryland.com) from BWI to Union Station for $6. The interval
between trains varies from 13 minutes to two hours, but usually is less
than an hour. The trip takes 25 to 35 minutes. Amtrak (% 800-872-7245;
www.amtrak.com) runs trains frequently on the same route from before
7 a.m. until after midnight. Tickets range from $11 to $37, and the trip
takes 25 to 35 minutes. A courtesy shuttle operates between BWI Airport
and the nearby BWI Rail Station.
ATMs and information desks are scattered throughout the airport.
Currency exchange services are available on the upper level by 
Pier C and on both levels of the International Pier.
From Union Station
Amtrak has great service in the Northeast Corridor. In my experience,
it’s the most efficient way to travel from New York to Washington and
from points between. Trains arrive a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol at
historic Union Station, a tourist attraction unto itself (see Chapter 11).
You can make taxi and Metrorail connections here.
From the Union Station Metrorail station, you pay $1.35 to ride a few
minutes to most hotels you’d be likely to stay at in central D.C. Taxi
fares are more complicated. (See Chapter 4 for an explanation.) To get
from Union Station to most of Washington’s prime tourist areas, you’ll
pay the cabbie $6.50 to $8.80, plus $1.50 for each additional passenger,
plus possibly more add-ons — plus a tip.
An Amtrak information station is in the middle of the gates area, and
there’s a tourist information stand in the Main Hall.
Arriving by car
They say you shouldn’t subject yourself to seeing the making of either
law or sausage. To that, I will add driving in Washington. Driving to
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
78

Washington isn’t much fun, either — at least not when you get close to
D.C.’s infamous Beltway. If you do drive here on a weekday, try to sched-
ule your arrival at the Beltway between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. — or after 
8 p.m. — to avoid the worst of the rush-hour insanity, which seems never
to go away entirely.
When you make your hotel reservations, ask for directions. To help visu-
alize the territory, see the “Driving to D.C.” map on p. 53.
Once you get to your Washington destination, park your buggy and leave
it parked until you leave. You’ll be much happier if you get around town
via Metrorail, Metrobus, taxi, or your own two feet.
If you drive to a hotel in town, be prepared to pay $20 or more to keep
your car in a garage each day.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Many first-time visitors are surprised to find that Washington is not all
marble and memorials. Even in the most populated areas, you can find
grass, trees, flowers, and places to chill. You can discover much more in
Washington than the White House, the Capitol, and the other familiar
places featured on the nightly news. In fact, the District has several dis-
tinct and distinctive neighborhoods. You can explore their different
facets during your visit and leave with a kaleidoscope of impressions. To
get you started, here are thumbnail sketches (and a handy map) of D.C.’s
major ’hoods.
Adams-Morgan
Vibrant and diverse — that’s Adams-Morgan, whose main crossroads
are 18th Street and Columbia Road NW, north of Dupont Circle. This
neighborhood’s ethnic restaurants, boutiques, and jumping nightlife
draw fun-seekers, especially in the evening and on weekends. Then,
Adams-Morgan is packed, and parking is nearly impossible. The Dupont
Circle and Woodley Park-Zoo Metrorail stations are a hike, but doable for
the physically fit. There are no hotels in Adams-Morgan, and after party-
ing at night most people head to other parts of town to sleep. After dark,
take a taxi or the no. 98 Metrobus, which runs from the Woodley Park-
Zoo Metrorail Station from about 6 p.m. to 3:15 a.m. weeknights, from
9:50 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. Saturdays, and from 6:05 p.m. to 12:15 a.m.
Sundays. Be sure to exercise your street smarts.
Capitol Hill
The Hill, as it is known around Washington, extends from the U.S. Capitol
in three directions: north, south, and east. Two of the three branches of
the federal government live here, as do a lot of people. In addition to
housing the Congress and the Supreme Court, Capitol Hill is a charming
residential neighborhood, with 19th-century houses, brick sidewalks,

WHAT’S DOING WHERE?
• ADAMS-MORGAN
   This neighborhood is vibrant and diverse.
   Come here to enjoy ethnic restaurants,
   boutiques, and nightspots.
• CAPITOL HILL
   Congress dominates Capitol Hill, and the 
   Supreme Court has its digs here, too.  
   But the Hill also is a charming residential
   neighborhood, with a bustling old-fashioned 
   market and gorgeous old Union Station.
• CHINATOWN
   D.C.’s Chinatown is quite small, but it’s got
   some very good restaurants and a large
   ornamental gateway.
• DUPONT CIRCLE
   Day or night, there’s always something doing  
   in Dupont Circle.  Pop into the galleries, 
   restaurants, boutiques, and nightspots that
   abound there. 
  
• FOGGY BOTTOM/WEST END
   As laid back as Dupont is lively, Foggy Bottom  
   boasts quiet residential streets, George 
   Washington University, the State Department,  
   and the Kennedy Center.
• GEORGETOWN
   The oldest part of D.C., Georgetown
   encompasses exclusive residential streets,
   Georgetown University hangouts, lots of
   wildly diverse shops, restaurants, and 
   nightspots. 
• NATIONAL MALL
   The Mall is lined with museums, dotted with  
   memorials, and bordered by government   
   headquarters buildings.
• PENN QUARTER
   A constantly expanding collction of galleries,
   restaurants, nightspots, and theaters makes 
   Penn Quarter a lively center of arts and
   entertainment.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

and tree-lined streets. You also find Union Station, the National Postal
Museum, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the historic — and lively —
Eastern Market, and quite a few restaurants, watering holes, and mom-
and-pop stores popular with the lawmakers, congressional staffers, lob-
byists, and journalists who work — and sometimes live — here. The
neighborhood brims with vitality and a persona uniquely its own.
Unfortunately, the area closest to the Capitol has become an eyesore
and a travel nightmare because of construction projects and stop-gap
security devices thrown up around government buildings. The Hill is
another place to watch your step after dark, particularly beyond the
Capitol grounds and the first few blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue SE.
The perks of staying on Capitol Hill are
 In addition to having easy access to the Hill’s attractions, you can
walk to the Mall or hop Metrorail to anywhere. The Hill is served by
Red, Blue, and Orange Line stations.
 If you arrive and depart by train, your lodging is conveniently close
to Union Station, which also is a great place to eat and shop.
 This area is easier on your pocketbook than many other D.C. 
neighborhoods.
On the downside
 Although the area has its pocket parks (small, welcome green spots
in the midst of urban surroundings), it has less elbow room than
other sections of the city.
 You won’t encounter many problems in the immediate vicinity of
the major hotels and attractions, but the farther you go from the
Capitol, the less safe you’ll be at night.
Downtown
Office buildings, shops, hotels, restaurants, and some government head-
quarters (including the White House) vie for space in this central area,
which runs roughly from 10th to 22nd streets NW, north of Pennsylvania
Avenue and south of the Dupont Circle neighborhood. Once as scintillat-
ing as white bread, the area now attracts nighttime and weekend visitors
thanks to redevelopment along Pennsylvania Avenue, the addition of
high-quality restaurants, and the endurance of long-standing theaters.
Downtown’s K Street is used as shorthand for lawyers and lobbyists,
even though most of them have their offices elsewhere. Connecticut
Avenue sports high-class shopping.
The advantages of staying downtown are
 You’re within walking distance of major attractions and Metrorail
stations for the Red, Blue, and Orange lines.
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
82

 Many of the city’s best restaurants are located here, as are a large
number of inexpensive eateries frequented by downtown workers
at lunch time.
On the other hand
 You can pay a high price for the convenient location.
 Much — though not all — of the area loses its vitality when the
office workers go home for the night.
Dupont Circle
One of Washington’s liveliest neighborhoods around the clock, the
Dupont Circle area is an ideal spot for people-watching. (Check out the
street musicians and chess players in the heart of the circle itself.) Early
in the morning, workers arrive at the embassies, businesses, think tanks,
and other nonprofit organizations that set up their headquarters here.
The area’s many restaurants feed people from breakfast through dinner.
The neighborhood is filled with art galleries and specialty shops. The
nightspots keep hopping until well after midnight. Kramerbooks (“open
early to late, seven days a week,” and never closing on weekends)
offered food, drink, and live music long before that became de rigueur
for all bookstores. Dupont Circle is the traditional hub of Washington’s
gay community, which parties in the neighborhood’s gay-oriented night
spots and shops — among many other places — at Lambda Rising book-
store and the Human Rights Campaign store.
On the upside
 This area is hip, trendy, lively, colorful, more interesting, and less
homogenized than most of the other neighborhoods in town.
 You’re close to some of the city’s best nightlife and dining.
 You can find reasonable prices here, too.
The drawbacks are
 You’re further from major tourist attractions than you would be in
several other areas, although you can easily hop onto Metro.
 All that after-dark partying means the area can get very noisy at
night.
 In a city full of traffic and parking horrors, this neighborhood can
be particularly nightmarish.
Foggy Bottom/West End
Insiders call the State Department “Foggy Bottom” because that’s the
neighborhood in which its headquarters stand, and the name seems per-
fect for the obfuscating parlance that marks much diplomatic dialogue.
George Washington University also occupies an ever-expanding portion
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

of the neighborhood. That leaves an ever-shrinking piece of the pie to
Foggy Bottom’s charming residential streets of brick row houses, Lilli-
putian gardens, and mature trees. Here, you also find the Kennedy
Center, the Watergate complex, and quite a few hotels. The neighbor-
hood got its name, by the way, because much of it was low, swampy land
that produced much fog and mist, and later was an industrial area
(called “Funkstown”) that was engulfed in smoke and smog.
Foggy Bottom encompasses the area west of the White House, east of
Georgetown, and south of Pennsylvania Avenue. West End refers to the
small neighborhood surrounded by Foggy Bottom, downtown, Dupont
Circle, and Georgetown. There you find office buildings and a few hotels
and restaurants.
The pros:
 You’re close to the White House, Kennedy Center, State Department,
George Washington University, the infamous Watergate, and
Georgetown.
 You can hop Metrorail or the 30-series Metrobuses for longer trips.
 A very pleasing European ambience pervades the neighborhood.
 Foggy Bottom is quieter than other sections of town.
The only con is that the quiet also means that the area usually has less
excitement than elsewhere.
Georgetown
One of Washington’s best-known neighborhoods was established before
the District of Columbia was a gleam in George Washington’s eye.
Fragments of a former era, when Georgetown was a bustling tobacco
port, endure in the residential architecture and the cobblestone and
brick streets off the main drags.
On Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, however, the mood is far from gen-
teel, especially on weekends. A mix of shops, restaurants, and night-
spots draws the young — and the young at heart — from D.C., the
suburbs, local universities, and all over the world. Georgetown
University, Dumbarton Oaks, the C&O Canal, the “Exorcist Steps” (fea-
tured in the movie), and some of the city’s most exclusive residences
contribute to Georgetown’s enduring cachet.
Georgetown has no Metrorail station, but 30-series Metrobuses run on
Wisconsin and on M to Pennsylvania Avenue. You can hike in from the
Foggy Bottom–GWU Metrorail Station. Georgetown Metro Connection
shuttle buses run from the Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, and Rosslyn
stations from 7 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 
2 a.m. Friday, 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Saturday, and 8 a.m. to midnight Sunday.
Fare’s $1.50 — or 35¢ with a Metrorail transfer. Another bus, the DC
Circulator, runs from Union Station, through downtown, to Wisconsin
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
84

Avenue and M Street, Georgetown’s main intersection. Tickets cost a
buck, 35¢ with transfer. The bus runs from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.
Staying in Georgetown is great because
 Like Dupont Circle, Georgetown jumps a lot more than most of
Washington.
 An abundance of shopping, dining, and nightlife is within walking
distance.
 Walk just northwest of Wisconsin and M, and you’re in another col-
lege community — Georgetown University.
 Walk just northeast and you enter Washington’s most exclusive res-
idential neighborhood, home to some of the richest, most powerful,
and most famous people in the world.
On the other hand
 If you seek tranquillity, especially at night, stay elsewhere. The
noise on weekends (when the student population comes out to
party) can grow very loud.
 Georgetown has no Metrorail station, so you have to hail a cab, hop
a bus, or hike to Foggy Bottom or (believe it or not) the Rosslyn
Station in Virginia.
 Georgetown can get very crowded. Traffic is bad at all times and is
particularly horrendous during rush hour, on weeknights, and
throughout the weekends.
The National Mall
Washington’s long, long lawn stretches from the Capitol to the Lincoln
Memorial and is where you find many museums, monuments, and
memorials. The Mall is lined by major Smithsonian Institutions and is
across the street from major federal government offices. You encounter
somber contemplation at places such as the Vietnam War Memorial and
joyful play on the grass and walkways (kite-flying, cycling, jogging,
strolling, and squirrel-watching).
There’s no point reviewing the pluses and minuses of staying on the
Mall, because there’s no place to sleep there (unless you pitch a tent,
which tends to be frowned upon).
Penn Quarter
Not so long ago, Penn Quarter was just an obscure, run-down corner of
Downtown. Now it’s one of the places to go, for several reasons. Bordered
by 10th Street, 6th Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Massachusetts
Avenue, Penn Quarter booms with a constantly increasing number of
restaurants, shops, galleries, and the Verizon Center sports and concert
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

arena. The area also encompasses much of what’s left of D.C.’s minuscule
Chinatown.
You’ll like Penn Quarter because
 It’s equaled — maybe surpassed — Georgetown, Dupont Circle, and
Adams-Morgan as a place to cut loose at night.
 It’s got several superb, and moderately priced, restaurants.
 If art galleries are your thing, you’ll find plenty here.
You may have second thoughts when
 You realize how noisy and crowded the place can be at night and
on weekends.
Upper Northwest
The Upper Northwest area is essentially everything north and west of
what I describe in the preceding sections. It’s mostly nice residential
neighborhoods, D.C.’s best public schools, some office buildings, and
the restaurants, theaters, and retail establishments that serve them.
Some hotels and tourist attractions, notably the Washington National
Cathedral and the National Zoo, are here. I live in this neighborhood, but
I take visitors elsewhere to sightsee. Where Wisconsin Avenue crosses
into Maryland is an area that I refer to as Washington’s Rodeo Drive — a
number of exclusive stores (plus some discounters) for those who are
inclined to expend substantial vacation bucks on shopping.
Some good points for staying here:
 Families appreciate the area’s proximity to the National Zoo, a
major child-pleaser, on Connecticut Avenue.
 You find Washington’s answer to Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive near
the Friendship Heights Metrorail Station.
 Washington National Cathedral is on upper Wisconsin Avenue.
The only bad thing is that you’ll be taking Metrorail, Metrobus, or a taxi
to see most of the sights.
Gathering Information after You Arrive
If you need information after you arrive in Washington, head for one or
more of these spots:
 Washington, D.C., Visitor Information Center, on the ground floor
of the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center Building, 1300
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, at the Federal Triangle Metrorail Station 
(% 866-324-7386; www.dcvisit.com). From March 15 through
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
86

Labor Day, the center is open 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays and 
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays. The rest of the year, it’s open 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. weekdays, closed weekends.
This center is a full-service spot. Staff members can answer your
questions, and you can pick up free brochures. You can buy Metro
fare cards, theater tickets, and sightseeing tickets. You can use its
computers to find out information about hotels, restaurants, and
events and can even book a hotel reservation.
 The White House Visitor Center, in the Commerce Department
Building, 15th and E streets NW, near the Federal Triangle Metrorail
Station (% 202-208-1631; www.nps.gov/whho/planyourvisit/
index.htm). At press time, White House tours are limited to groups
of at least ten who get tickets from a member of Congress. But the
National Park Service continues to operate this visitor center, which
isn’t in the White House.
It’s open 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day except Thanksgiving, Decem-
ber 25, and January 1. You can find information here about other
parts of Washington in addition to the White House. You can use
restrooms, telephones, and water fountains and obtain first aid if
you need it.
 The Smithsonian Information Center, in the “Castle,” 1000 Jeffer-
son Dr. SW, on the National Mall, near the Smithsonian Metrorail
Station (% 202-633-1000; TTY 202-357-1729; www.si.edu/visit/
infocenter/start.htm; e-mail info@si.edu). Stop here for infor-
mation about the Smithsonian and other attractions. Watch an 18-
minute video for an overview of the institution. Peruse a model of
the Mall to help you locate your first stop. Find attractions and
Metro and Tourmobile stops using an electronic map. Pick up a free
guide in any of seven languages. Grab a bite to eat in the cafe.
This center also has information about events elsewhere in the city.
Your kids can access information from the video-display monitors
while you challenge the staff with your questions. If you’re on over-
load, ask one of the volunteers for help in planning your itinerary.
On your way out, you may want to pay your respects to British sub-
ject James Smithson, whose bequest gave birth to the institution.
His crypt is just inside the Jefferson Drive entrance. The center is
open 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily except December 25.
Getting Around Washington
Washington can be a challenge to navigate, particularly for a newcomer.
But once you know the basics, you can negotiate the tourist areas with
ease.
D.C. has streets, avenues, roads, drives, places, squares, circles — and
probably some other arteries that have slipped my mind. The avenues,
roads, drives, and places go every which way. Roadways run into physical
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

barriers and disappear, only to reappear again several blocks away.
Circles and squares pop up in your way and leave you searching for your
route on the other side. But the street-naming system is based on a grid
that extends throughout the city. If you understand how the street-naming
system works, you can find almost any address and figure out where you
are most of the time.
The key to the city: Getting from here to there
When D.C. was created from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia, it was
a perfect square, 10 miles on a side, with one corner pointing due north.
In due course, Virginia was given back most of Southwest D.C. and a por-
tion of Northwest, which is why the district now has an irregular shape
defined by the Potomac River along its border with Virginia.
The street-naming system, based on the original square, has endured.
The city is divided into quadrants, and all the streets are known by the
quadrant they’re in: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE),
and Southwest (SW).
Understanding the District’s directions
The Capitol dome is the center of D.C. geography. Three streets — North
Capitol, East Capitol, and South Capitol — run in those directions from
the Capitol grounds. You won’t find a West Capitol Street, but you can
imagine it running due west from the Capitol down the center of the
National Mall. These streets define the boundaries of the four quadrants.
All of Washington’s numbered streets run north-south, counting from 
the Capitol. First Street NE is the first street east of North Capitol Street.
First Street NW is the first street west of North Capitol Street. First Street
SE is the first street east of South Capitol Street. Just to confuse things,
here and there you encounter a Half Street, which is closer to Capitol
Street than a portion of First Street.
Washington’s east–west-running streets all have names that — in most
cases — work through the alphabet as they get further north and south
of East Capitol Street and the middle of the National Mall. The streets
closest to East Capitol and the middle of the Mall are named for letters —
A Street, B Street, and so on. As you continue north and south and the
alphabet is exhausted, you run into streets with two-syllable names —
Adams, Bryant, Channing, and so on. Then you hit three-syllable names
(Allison, Buchanan).
Unfortunately, you find numerous exceptions to these rules. For some
reason — or perhaps for no reason at all — no J, X, Y, or Z streets exist.
Some streets break the alphabet and syllable rules. And the roadways
that aren’t streets — avenues, roads, drives, places — do whatever they
feel like doing.
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
88

If you understand the basic street grid, you can find almost any address
and figure out where you are most of the time. If you’re looking for 450 H
St. NW, you know it’s in the Northwest quadrant of the city, eight streets
north of the middle of National Mall, between 4th and 5th streets. If
you’re looking for 850 4th St. NE, you know it’s in the Northeast quad-
rant, between H and I streets.
You’ll notice I said “almost.” The numbered streets don’t mess around.
But some named streets defy the alphabet and syllable standards. And,
because there is no J Street, the block between K and L is the 1000 block.
I’m sorry. At least you’ll be able to estimate locations within a few blocks.
(And then you can ask directions!)
Movin’ around on Metro
Washington’s extensive public transportation system makes getting
around the city a cinch. Metrorail, called Metro by locals, is the city’s
subway system. Rail stations open at 5 a.m. on weekdays and at 7 a.m.
on weekends. Final trains leave stations around midnight Sunday through
Thursday and around 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday. If you’re traveling late
at night, check the exact time of the last train leaving the station you’ll
be using. The schedule is posted at the kiosks in each station. You can
reach Metro information at % 202-637-7000 (TTY 202-638-3780) or
online at www.wmata.com. Request a Metro Visitor’s Kit by calling 
% 888-638-7646 or 202-962-2733. You can find visitors information
online at www.wmata.com/riding/visitors/visitors.cfm.
Finding Metrorail stations
To find a Metrorail station on Washington’s streets, look for the brown
pole topped by the letter M and the station name. You should see a col-
ored stripe beneath the M to indicate the line or lines that stop there.
The different Metrorail lines are named for colors — Red, Blue, Orange,
Yellow, and Green. Trains are well marked, but sometimes trains from
different lines (such as Blue and Orange) use the same tracks. If you’re
unsure, ask the station manager or another waiting passenger. If you find
yourself on the wrong train, hop off and take a train back to the station
where you made the mistake.
Metrorail’s cars are air-conditioned, and the seats are upholstered.
Stations are clean and well lighted. Though Metrorail is showing its age
(not unlike most people), a major effort is underway to replace tired
escalators, refurbish old trains, and put new trains on the rails.
Trains run every few minutes during rush hour, less often at other times,
least often late at night. I always carry reading material for use when I’m
sitting on the train and waiting at the station. Or you can use your trans-
portation time to people-watch.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 91

Paying your way on Metro
Getting around via Metrorail is relatively inexpensive. Fares are based on
distance traveled and time of day. Off peak, the minimum fare is $1.35. 
You pay less than $2.25 for most trips within D.C., even during rush hour
(weekdays before 9:30 a.m. and from 3 to 7 p.m.). There’s also a surcharge
after 2 a.m. You can buy fare cards from vending machines inside the sta-
tions. The machines accept coins (from nickels to quarters) and bills
(from $1 to $20). Some machines take credit cards. Bear in mind that the
machines return up to only $5 in change — in coins only — so make sure
that you use small bills when you buy a low-value fare card. Experiencing
difficulty? Ask the station manager — or a nearby local — for help.
Estimate the amount of fare you need throughout your D.C. stay and buy
one fare card per person with that amount on it. That way, you don’t have
to stop at a fare card vending machine each time you want to take a ride.
Each passenger needs a fare card. One or two children younger than 5 can
ride free with a paying passenger. Disabled persons and seniors 65 and
older can ride for half price with a special fare card, but they must pos-
sess valid proof of disability or age. For the senior discount, identification
can be a driver’s license or birth certificate. If the disabled person doesn’t
have a Medicare card, however, the discount probably isn’t worth the
paperwork for someone who’s visiting for a few days or even a few weeks.
A convenient place to purchase the half-price fare cards is the sales office
inside the Metro Center Metrorail Station. You can get to it through the
station’s 12th and F streets entrance or by taking a train to the station.
The sales office is open weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The cards
also are sold at some stores, including some Safeway and Giant groceries.
One-day rail passes cost $6.50 and allow unlimited rides for a single
weekday after 9:30 a.m. or all day Saturday and Sunday. You can buy
them at all Metrorail stations.
After you insert your fare card in the entrance gate, it’s stamped and
returned. Don’t walk off without it (as many visitors do). You need to
reinsert it in the exit gate at your destination, where the card is returned
if value is left on it. If you underestimate the fare, you can add what’s nec-
essary at the Addfare machines found near the exit and entrance gates.
Hints for smooth riding on Metrorail
First-time passengers sometimes find the system intimidating. Follow
these tips, and you should enjoy a smooth ride. (Should you start to
hyperventilate, just ask a station attendant for help.)
 Use the maps. Wall-mounted maps and the lists of station-to-station
fares are posted in Metrorail stations. Take your time in locating
the station closest to your destination. When in doubt, ask the sta-
tion manager. You can get maps at Metrorail stations. You can
download a map from the Metro Web site at www.wmata.com/
metrorail/colormap.pdf.
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
92

 Hold onto your fare card when it’s returned to you. Keep it handy
for reinsertion at your destination.
 Don’t board the wrong train. It sounds obvious, but the minute (or
two) that you take to note the station stops, listed on columns
inside the stations, is worth it.
 Do not eat, drink, or smoke on Metro or in the stations. This rule
is serious! Washington’s Metro is one of the cleanest subway sys-
tems in the world, and this rule is the reason for it. The police will
fine — and even arrest — you for sipping a soft drink or nibbling on
potato chips in a station or on a train. Keep your snacks in your
backpacks.
 Get a transfer ticket if you’re switching from Metrorail to
Metrobus. You can get one from a machine where you enter the
Metrorail system to start your trip, and it lets you transfer to a reg-
ular bus for 35¢ and to an express bus for $2.10. You can’t get a bus-
to-subway transfer.
 On the escalator, stand to the right and walk on the left. Blocking
walkers by standing on the left is considered exceedingly rude. A
columnist for the Washington Post staged a contest a few years ago
to come up with a name for people who stand to the left. The win-
ning entry: “Tourists.”
Traveling by Metrobus
Metrobuses run throughout Washington and its Maryland and Virginia
suburbs. Metrorail is faster and more comfortable. But the subway 
doesn’t go to as many places as the buses do. For tourists, the 30-series
buses are quite useful.
All 30, 32, 34, 35, and 36 buses travel down Wisconsin Avenue from the
D.C.-Maryland border to M Street in the heart of Georgetown. They then
go through the heart of downtown and along part of the National Mall on
their way to Capitol Hill and beyond.
To find Metrobus stops, look for the red, white, and blue signs with route
numbers. You can request a free map of all Metrobus Routes in D.C. and
Virginia, which is probably all you need to hit the major sights, by phon-
ing % 202-637-7000. A map of the D.C. and Maryland routes is available,
as well. You can download bus and rail maps at this Web site: www.
wmata.com/maps/maps.cfm. You also can get the maps at Metrorail 
stations and Metro sales offices.
Bus fare is $1.25, except for some suburban express routes that cost $3.
Bus-to-bus transfers are free; ask the driver of your first bus. Drivers
don’t make change, so you need to carry exact fare. Most buses run
daily around the clock — frequently during rush hour, infrequently in
the wee hours.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 93

Up to two children younger than 5 ride free with a paying passenger.
Seniors 65 and older and persons with disabilities can ride for 60¢. Valid
proof of age or disability must be presented when boarding. For seniors,
a driver’s license or birth certificate works. A disabled person needs a
Medicare card or a special Metro ID that, for a visitor, probably is more
trouble to get than it’s worth.
Other buses
The D.C. Circulator (http://dccirculator.com) and the Georgetown
Metro Connection (www.georgetowndc.com/shuttle.php) offer other
ways to get around central D.C.
The Georgetown shuttle buses connect this popular but Metrorail-starved
neighborhood with the Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, and Rosslyn Metro-
rail stations. Buses run from 7 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thurs-
day, 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday, 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Saturday, and 8 a.m. to
midnight Sunday. Fare’s $1.50, or 35¢ with a Metrorail transfer. The Con-
nection’s two routes intersect at Wisconsin and M. One travels mostly on
M between Rosslyn and Dupont Circle. The other runs mostly on Wiscon-
sin and K, from Foggy Bottom to Wisconsin’s intersection with R.
The Circulator has three routes. One runs mostly along K Street and
Massachusetts Avenue between Union Station and Wisconsin and M.
Another circles the National Mall on Independence Avenue, Constitution
Avenue, 17th Street, and 4th Street. The third travels north–south,
mostly on 7th and 9th streets, between the Convention Center and the
Southwest Waterfront. A ride costs $1 – 35¢ with Metro transfer. The
Circulator bus operates 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.
Taxi! Cabbing it in D.C.
Hailing a cab in Washington usually is a snap, except for late at night.
Stand on a main street, by a busy intersection, or in front of a hotel or
large office building to better snag a taxi. When I need to order a cab, I
call Diamond (% 202-387-6200, 202-797-5916, 202-797-5915, or, for air-
port service, 202-387-2600). Diamond’s not perfect, but I seem to get a
higher percentage of well-maintained cabs with knowledgeable drivers
with Diamond than with some other companies.
Strangers to D.C. may find the zone fare system baffling — as do the
locals. But if you ride a Washington cab, you have to deal with it. For
details, see Chapter 4.
Items left in a cab are supposed to be turned in to the D.C. Taxicab
Commission (% 202-645-6018, fax 202-889-3604; http://dctaxi.dc.
gov/dctaxi). If you leave something in a cab, phone, fax, or e-mail the
commission with this information: your name, daytime telephone number,
a brief description of the item (include model and phone number for
cellphone), and the date it was lost. Also have the name, ID number, and
vehicle license plate number of the cab, if you know it. If you have a

Taking a ride on Tourmobile
An excellent alternative mode of transportation for tourists is Tour-
mobile (% 202-554-5100, 888-868-7707; www.tourmobile.com), the
tram that stops by major tourist attractions and at points in Arlington
Cemetery. The $20 fare ($10 for children 3 through 11 and free for
younger kids) lets you ride all day with unlimited reboarding privileges.
That means you can ride the full route, listening to the tour guide’s nar-
rative, and get a good overview of most of the big attractions. Then you
can use the Tourmobile as a bus to go from place to place for the rest of
the day. A two-day pass is $30 or $15.
Trams stop about every 20 minutes at the red, white, and blue Tour-
mobile signs from 9:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. daily except December 25 and
January 1. Final reboarding is at 3:30 p.m. You can buy tickets from the
driver or at Tourmobile ticket booths.
All Tourmobile trams are equipped with priority seating for individuals
with disabilities and wheelchair storage space. Individuals with disabili-
ties who can transfer from their wheelchairs and climb three steps can
board any Tourmobile. Vehicles with lifts are dispatched when a request
is made to a Tourmobile driver or at a ticket booth. You can schedule
service by a lift-equipped vehicle in advance by calling % 703-979-0690
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily except December 25 and January 1.
Disabled riders can leave the tram at any stop and arrange a reboarding
time with the driver.
Walking through Washington
Like Nancy Sinatra’s boots, Washington is made for walking. In these
health- and budget-conscious times, putting mileage on your feet instead
of your wallet, fare card, or car makes sense. On foot, you discover
things that you may otherwise miss, things that make a trip special.
(When you get home, please write and tell me what they are.)
Try a Mall crawl, walking from museum to museum between the Capitol
and the Washington Monument. The museums are air-conditioned; you
can rest and rejuvenate in a restaurant or snack bar. Or stroll through
the residential side streets of Foggy Bottom and/or Georgetown.
Keep your wits about you when you walk. That’s not to say that D.C.
isn’t safe to walk around. It is, especially in the major tourist zones. It
just pays to be prepared.
Stride with a sense of purpose; dawdlers appear vulnerable, which is
just what professional pickpockets and muggers look for. Be alert in
crowds, where a bump from a pickpocket can easily be missed. Be aware
of your surroundings. Stow wallets, cash, credit cards, and travelers

checks in front pockets or a money pouch worn under your clothing.
Wear your purse across one shoulder and over the chest — bandolier
style. Lock your hotel room door, car doors, and trunk. Don’t leave lug-
gage or other items visible in your car when you park it. Lock valuables
in a safe deposit box (if not in your room, then at the front desk). Keep a
close eye on your pocketbook and camera. Hold onto your purse in a
restaurant. Don’t leave a purse or other bag unattended in public. Not
only might you lose it to a purse snatcher, you might lose it to law
enforcement officials who worry that there’s a bomb inside. Leave the
family jewels at home; what you do bring, don’t flash.
The safe zones include the major tourist areas and Metro. At night, 
use the buddy system and stick to the well-lighted, highly populated,
main commercial blocks — especially in Adams-Morgan, the U Street
Corridor, and Capitol Hill. The Mall used to feel safe round the clock, but
a couple of well-publicized muggings after dark in 2006 challenged that
complacency — as did a mugging that became a murder on a residential
street in Georgetown. If Metro’s service has stopped for the night, and
you’re still out on the town, take a taxi. Know your destination before
you set out. Hold your kids’ hands on city streets and sidewalks, on all
Metro escalators, and on Metro platforms.
On Capitol Hill, you won’t encounter many problems in the immediate
vicinity of the major hotels, restaurants, and attractions. But the farther
you go from the Capitol, the less safe you’ll be at night.
Driving your car
I have yet to meet a person who enjoys driving in Washington. The traf-
fic is oppressive and constantly getting worse. Washington also seems to
be cursed by an ever-growing number of drivers who drive as if no one
else is on the road. Street parking is at a premium. Garage parking will
consume your family’s lunch money.
If you plan on arriving by car, ask about parking rates at your hotel when
you make a reservation. It may prevent your requiring treatment for
shock when the final hotel tab is totaled up.

Best Hotels

B
ecause so many different kinds of people come to Washington with
regularity, the city has a wide variety of accommodations. The ideal-
istic young and penniless come here, perhaps to protest, to volunteer
for the many do-gooder groups in town, or just to see the sights. At the
other extreme, high-rolling lawyers and lobbyists arrive with no worries
about expense accounts because their clients will be picking up what-
ever tab is presented. The rest of the world, in the vast middle between
those extremes, is looking for budget, moderate, or moderately luxuri-
ous accommodations. Fortunately, visitors can find them all.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Some folks call a hotel, ask for a rate, and pay it with no more questions
asked. These are the same folks who go to an automobile dealer and pay
sticker price. You, however, aren’t going to mimic these people by
paying the first price you’re quoted, because you’re going to use the tips
that follow to find the best hotel room for your money.
Finding the best rates
If you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night, you’ll be
told the hotel’s maximum charge for that room — its rack rate. (During
your next hotel stay, take a peek at the fire and/or emergency directions
posted on the back of your door; the rack rates usually are posted on or
near these notices.) If a hotel can get away with collecting its rack rate
for a room, the management is very happy. But here’s the scoop: Hardly
anyone forks over the rack rate. Avoiding the rack rate is surprisingly
simple: Ask whether the hotel offers a cheaper or discounted rate. You

almost always get a better price! Better yet, don’t walk in off the street.
Make reservations ahead of time.
Room rates change with the season, as occupancy rates rise and fall. If a
hotel is close to full, it’s less likely to extend discount rates; if a hotel is
close to empty, it may be willing to negotiate. D.C. hotels are more likely
to negotiate with you on weekends and during low season.
Low season — low prices
The three best times of year to find deals on hotel rooms in D.C. are:
 Thanksgiving through New Year’s. Fewer travelers leave home and
hearth.
 July and August. Congress is in recess, and the city is in siesta
mode.
 Weekends throughout the year. Politicians (and the folks who
follow them) get outta town, leaving space for everyone else.
Between Thanksgiving and early January, the pace here slows down.
Many members of Congress take very long breaks from Washington.
(The House calls them “district work periods.” The Senate calls them
“recesses.” They’re usually actually a bit of both.) And folks in the rest of
the country are less likely to pack up for a Washington vacation during
the year-end holidays. With fewer people in town, hotels cut their rates.
During July and August, when the Senate and House office buildings are
morguelike because the elected officials are away for their summer recess/
work period, hotels woo visitors with lower charges. (For more on
Washington’s high and low seasons, see Chapter 3.) And on the week-
ends, the gang on the Hill heads home again, as do the visiting lobbyists,
and hotel rates again take a dip.
High season — high prices
High season in Washington is:
 Mid-March through June. Everyone wants to visit D.C. in the
spring, and who can blame them? The city blossoms in the warm
weather, but, alas, so do hotel prices.
 September through mid-November. Congress is back in session,
and Capitol Hill is hopping in fall. The weather outside may be
delightful, but it’s a safe bet that hotel prices will be frightful.
In spring, the Cherry Blossom Festival, good weather, and school dis-
tricts’ spring breaks historically draw visitors to the city in huge num-
bers. The weather is usually mild into June, and that keeps the crowds
coming. High season also occurs when the Capitol is a beehive of activ-
ity, and those who want to influence Congress converge.

Chapter 9: Checking In at D.C.’s Best Hotels 101

Surfing the Web for hotel deals
You can use the Internet to gather information and make hotel reserva-
tions. In fact, because so many different deals are available, your best
bet is to use both the telephone and the Internet when you search for
the best prices. Check several online sources as well.
Major hotel chains — and many individual hotels — book rooms online
the same way that airlines and Amtrak book transportation. (See the
Quick Concierge for chains’ Web addresses and phone numbers.)
Expedia offers a long list of special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of
rooms so that you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps to
counter claims that the best rooms are often held back from bargain
booking Web sites). Travelocity posts unvarnished customer reviews
and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating system. Also reli-
able are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. Be sure to get a confirmation
number and make a printout of any online booking transaction, in case
questions about your reservation arise.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline is even better for hotels than
for airfares; you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality level of
your hotel before offering up your money. On the down side, many hotels
stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. You must pay up
front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Be sure to go to the BiddingFor-
Travel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a
hotel room on Priceline; it provides information about recent winning
bids to help you decide how much to offer. Note: Some hotels don’t pro-
vide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities
when you book a room through opaque online services.
Room rates change with the season, as occupancy rates rise and fall. But
even within a given season, room prices are subject to change without
notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different from the actual
rate you receive when you make your reservation.
Reserving the best room
The amount you spend to bed down eats a big chunk of your travel dol-
lars. In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. Prices change, sometimes faster than room service can
deliver coffee and a bagel.
Calling your friendly travel agent
A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with certain hotels
than you can get by yourself. Often, the hotel gives the agent a discount
in exchange for steering his or her business toward that hotel.
Your travel agent may suggest a package deal (with airfare) and/or trav-
eling with a group. (See Chapter 5 for more on package tours.) Booking
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
102

with a group can be the best way to get the best deal. Not only do you
hand over the responsibility of planning the trip to someone else — the
tour operator — you often get a better rate. Hotels, joyful at the prospect
of booking 20 rooms instead of one or two, give tour operators a dis-
count that’s passed on to you.
Making your own hotel reservations
Hotel chains take telephone reservations through a central toll-free
number and at the individual hotels. (See the Quick Concierge at the
back of the book for toll-free numbers for the major chains.) Sometimes
the toll-free number and local numbers produce different rates. Your
best bet is to call both and see which provides a better deal.
Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs,
and any other corporate rewards programs, or whether you’re a govern-
ment employee, when you make your reservation. You never know when
doing so can save you a few dollars off your room rate.
After you make your reservation, ask a few more questions. These
inquiries can go a long way toward making sure that you secure the best
room for the best price.
 Always ask whether a corner room is available at the same price.
Sometimes a corner room has more space and more windows (with
views). And the corner location may mean a quieter environment. If
you’re located at the end of the hall, you don’t hear neighbors pass-
ing your room or using the elevator all night.
 Steer clear of construction zones. Be sure to ask whether the hotel
is renovating. If it is, request a room away from the renovation site.
The noise may be more than you want to deal with on your vacation.
 Request smoking or nonsmoking rooms. Be sure to indicate your
preference. Otherwise, you may get stuck with a room that doesn’t
meet your needs.
 Inquire about the location of the restaurants, bars, and night-
spots. These areas of the hotel can be sources of irritating noise.
On the other hand, if you want to be near the action, or if you have
a disability that makes it difficult for you to get around, you may
choose to be close to these amenities.
Even if you secure a relatively quiet room, strange noises, loud TVs, and
snoring partners can wreak havoc with your sleep. Carry earplugs when
you travel.
Arriving without a Reservation
Arriving in D.C. and then looking for a place to stay is not the preferred
way to find a bargain — or a room of any kind, for that matter. If you do
find yourself in this bind, call the major hotel chains and ask what they
Chapter 9: Checking In at D.C.’s Best Hotels 103

have available. (See the Quick Concierge at the back of this book for
their phone numbers.) Or try some local reservation services, such as
Capitol Reservations (% 202-452-1270, 800-847-4832; www.washington
dchotels.com), and Washington, D.C. Accommodations (% 202-289-
2220, 800-503-3330; www.dcaccommodations.com).
When it’s open, the Washington, D.C., Visitor Information Center (Ronald
Reagan International Trade Center Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW;
Metro: Federal Triangle; % 866-324-7386; www.dcvisit.com), helps
walk-ins book hotel rooms. From March 15 through Labor Day, it’s open
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays. The rest
of the year, it’s open 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays, closed weekends.
Washington’s Best Hotels at All Prices
In this section, I get down to the really important stuff: D.C.’s best hotels
at various price levels.
I provide reviews of these hotels and list them alphabetically. I also
include two indexes to help you quickly find the hotels you want to con-
sider. One index lists the hotels by price range, the other by neighbor-
hood. And I show the hotels’ locations on a map. In case these inns are
booked, I offer a list of runners-up.
Table 9-1 explains what the dollar-sign ratings in each listing mean. The
price range reflects the average of the highest and lowest prices quoted
for a standard double room for one night in high season.

Capitol Hill Suites

Capitol Hill
You become an instant Capitol Hill insider when you bed down here. You’re
2 blocks from the Capitol Grounds and across the street from the Library
of Congress’s Madison Building. You get dining privileges at the nearby
Capitol Hill Club, the Republican Party social club that’s next door to GOP
National Committee headquarters. And you may bump into one of the law-
makers who take advantage of the hotel’s long-term rates to make this
their Washington home. All suites have kitchenettes. The junior suites are
one-room efficiencies, with one queen bed and an armchair with ottoman
or sofa bed. Superior suites have two queen beds, an alcove for the kitch-
enette, and a sitting area with an armchair and ottoman or a sofa bed. The
one-bedroom suites have a king or queen bed and a separate living room
with a sofa bed. In decorating the hotel, the operators tried to capture

what they call the “traditional Capitol Hill” look. That means lots of navy
blue and burgundy, leather, marble, and cherry wood. Room rate includes
continental breakfast and use of a nearby health club. Valet parking is

Four Points by Sheraton

Downtown
This hotel has a room with a view, but it’s not the room you’ll be sleeping
in. Rather, it’s the heated indoor pool on the roof, one of many amenities
that make this place a good buy, especially if you snag an off-peak deal that
can run $125-a-night or less. From the pool, you get a panoramic look at
D.C., including the Capitol dome. Four Points offers concierge services,
room service, valet parking, fitness center, business center, and an on-site
restaurant. Each room has high-speed Internet access, two-line phones
with dataports and voice mail, a coffeemaker, and security safe designed
to accommodate a laptop computer. You can ask for a microwave and

Georgetown
Where Foggy Bottom meets Georgetown, you find one of Washington’s most
celebrity-friendly (and kid-friendly) hotels. The rich and famous love this
place because of its luxury and the staff’s discretion and impeccable serv-
ice. The concierge can rent you a tux, find you a toothbrush, or get you the-
ater tickets. You can take high tea or sip a cocktail in the Garden Terrace.
An indoor pool and a health club offer all imaginable amenities. If you want
to work — what? — the hotel has every imaginable business service as well.
George Washington never slept here, but Tom Hanks, Sheryl Crow, and
Nicolas Cage have. The hotel also brags about its service to “VICs” (Very
Important Children). Kids receive gifts and snacks at check-in. They can
use the hotel’s board games, videotapes, coloring books, kid-sized terry
bathrobes, toddler slippers, and teddy bears. Parents can request baby
necessities, such as a crib, high chair, and bottle-warmer. Children’s menus

Georgetown Suites

Georgetown
This Georgetown accommodation can be good for families because the
suites with bedrooms allow for some privacy and the kitchens enable you
to cook. I know cooking isn’t what most vacationers put on their itineraries.
But vacationing with kids can be much more pleasant when you can return
to your lodgings for meals, snacks, and naps. Here, your meal options
include a free continental breakfast. Your lodging choices include a one-
room studio “suite” (queen-size bed and sitting area with loveseat), a
“double double suite” (two double beds and a sitting area), or a one-bed-
room suite (king bed and separate living room with pull-out queen-size
sofa). A two-bedroom suite has two bathrooms, master bedroom with king
bed, a second bedroom with full bed, and a living room with queen sofa-
bed. All have a kitchen with refrigerator, coffeemaker, microwave, and dish-
washer. More-luxurious town house and penthouse accommodations are
available. The hotel has an exercise room and business center. The suites
are in two buildings. The main building, at 1111 30th St. NW, is quieter.
Additional perks: Local phone calls and high-speed Internet access are free.

George Washington University Inn

Foggy Bottom/West End
Located in a quiet, tree-lined residential section of Foggy Bottom, the
George Washington University Inn is an ideal place to park your suitcase if
you’re visiting the university or sampling the performing arts at the
Kennedy Center. The inn is essentially on the GWU campus; it’s about 3 long
blocks from the Kennedy Center. The short walk to the Foggy Bottom–GWU
Metrorail Station and to the 30-series Metrobus routes on Pennsylvania
Avenue makes visiting the rest of the city easy, too. The 95 rooms (31 of
which are one-bedroom suites) are relatively large, decorated in colonial
Williamsburg style, and come with mini refrigerators, microwaves, and

Hay-Adams

The Hay-Adams is such a Washington institution that its reopening after an
$18-million renovation was front-page news in the Washington Post’s busi-
ness section. It’s hard to imagine a better location for an upscale hotel —
directly across picturesque Lafayette Square from the White House. Built
in 1928, the Hay-Adams long has been a top choice of the rich, the power-
ful, and the simply famous. Sure, Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, and Meg
Ryan have stayed here. But so have Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart,
and Sinclair Lewis. The prime attraction of the Hay-Adams always will be
what it always has been — that location. Windows in the higher-level
rooms on the south side look across Lafayette Square to the White House,
with the Washington Monument in the distance. Now, all the amenities are
21st-century state-of-the-art. Impressed by hotel rooms with two tele-
phones? Every Hay-Adams room has three two-line phones, including a
cordless phone. You also get voice mail, a high-speed Internet connection,
a component audio system, 24-hour room service, business services, valet
parking, and — of course — the concierge. Will you pay mightily for this
luxury? Well . . . if you have to ask . . .

Capitol Hill
This Holiday Inn enjoys a choice location, about 2 blocks from Union

ities are strikingly decorated. Standard rooms now come with one king bed
and easy chair or sofa, or two queen beds with an easy chair. Every guest
room has free high-speed Internet access. The lobby, restaurant, and meet-
ing rooms enjoy Wi-Fi access. A large rooftop pool, which provides a great
view of the area, is open in summer. The fitness center has treadmills, step-

Hostelling International

Downtown
I promised you accommodations in all price ranges, and this one is the
lowest price you’re gonna get — at least anywhere you’ll want to stay,
unless you’re visiting a friend with a spare bed or space on the floor. If you
want candy, you better bring it with you because you don’t get Godiva on
your pillow here. And you can’t watch TV in bed. Whaddaya expect at
these prices? This 270-bed facility is basic. It is, however, clean and com-
fortable, with dorm-style rooms (all air-conditioned), and it’s just 3 blocks
from Metro Center. The rooms, some coed, sleep 4 to 12 guests. Bathrooms
are down the hall. But you get free continental breakfast, high-speed
Internet access, and use of a theater-style TV room with a 60-inch screen,
kitchen, dining room, luggage storage, lockers, and coin laundry. The
hostel organizes activities for guests, such as walking tours. The savvy
staff can help you with your itinerary. Families and couples can reserve
private rooms for themselves, but you must do so at least a month in
advance.

Hotel Harrington

When you think bargain and no frills, think Hotel Harrington. Family-owned
since it opened in 1914, the Harrington caters to groups, families, and
others looking for good value. It’s an easy walk to the White House, the
National Mall, and many other attractions, such as the FBI headquarters,
Ford’s Theatre, the National Theater, and MCI Center. In addition, the
Metro Center Metrorail Station is 2 blocks away for access to anyplace else
you’d like to go. If you’re traveling with your kids, a family suite is a good
idea. The suite includes two rooms (queen bed in one, two twin beds in
the other), two bathrooms, compact refrigerator, and coffee/tea maker.
Some extra-large rooms sleep up to six. You can have a fridge put into
many rooms. Toss in a load at the self-service laundry on the premises.
The hotel has three on-site restaurants, all reasonably priced, and plenty

Hotel Monaco

Penn Quarter
You get history with your sleep at the Monaco, a luxury hotel that resulted
from a three-year rehabilitation of a 19th-century government palace. It
was designed by two noted architects and served first as Washington’s
general post office and then as the Tariff Commission headquarters.
Robert Mills, architect of the Washington Monument, modeled his post
office design on the Temple of Jupiter in Rome; it opened in 1842. Thomas
Walter, an architect of the Capitol, designed the 1869 addition. As a guest,
you get marble columns outside and a mixture of the 19th and 21st cen-
turies inside. The spacious guest rooms have plush furnishings, work-
spaces, cordless phones, complimentary high-speed Internet access, and
a bust of Thomas Jefferson. The hotel even pampers your pet or lends you
a goldfish if you long for company during your stay. The Monaco also is
well located in D.C.’s new and growing arts and entertainment district.

Debuted in 1923, the Jefferson is still considered one of the city’s very best

return guests by name. Antiques, original art, and reproductions grace the
67 rooms and 33 suites, many with balconies, some with wood-burning fire-
places. Some rooms include canopied beds, and each room features two-
line telephones, speaker-phone, voice mail, fax machine, and Internet
access, along with video and CD player. Double-glazed windows mute the
traffic noise from 16th and M streets. The hotel has 24-hour room service
along with concierge and business services, a good restaurant, a com-

Jurys Normandy Inn
$$$
Dupont Circle
This relatively small, homey hotel is a bit out of the way, but not too far for
the accommodations when you can get a discount. It’s about 5 blocks
north of the Dupont Circle Metrorail Station, in the neighborhood known
as Kalorama, and about the same distance from the heart of Adams-
Morgan, which are two of D.C.’s most popular entertainment districts, with
plenty of restaurants and nightspots. The hotel is located in a neighbor-
hood of imposing residences and diplomatic facilities. (Check out the
French ambassador’s digs at 2221 Kalorama Rd., for a truly jaw-dropping
example.) If you stay here, you can call this intriguing neighborhood your
own for a brief spell. Jurys Normandy also truly is a bargain. For relatively
little money (for Washington), you get a comfortable room with free high-
speed Internet access, two-line phone with dataport, minifridge, cof-
feemaker, and complimentary newspaper on weekdays. Tea and coffee are

Jurys Washington Hotel
$$$$
Dupont Circle
Unlike its sibling, Jurys Normandy, this hotel is not out of the way at all. It’s
right on the northeastern edge of the Dupont Circle action. With its more
convenient location, Jurys Washington naturally is pricier than the
Normandy. But it still often offers really good deals. The Jurys hotels are
run by an Irish organization, Jurys Doyle Hotels of Dublin, and that’s
reflected in the Washington’s bar — Biddy Mulligan’s — which is styled as
an Irish pub, with the bar itself imported from the Old Country. The rooms
at Jurys Washington are large, pretty, and comfortable. They come with
the usual amenities, including high-speed Internet access. The hotel offers
room service, a business center, and an exercise room. Discounted rates
sometimes drop below $100.

Mandarin Oriental
$$$$$
Tidal Basin
If you’ve got the bucks to buy your way in, you’ll love the luxury of this
gorgeous, comfortable, and pampering hotel. Overlooking the Tidal Basin,
just 21⁄2 blocks south of the National Mall, the Mandarin is well located for
daytime sightseeing, but not for walking alone at night. The views from the
rooms and the public spaces are terrific, especially when the Tidal Basin’s
cherry blossoms bloom in spring. Depending on where you’re located, you
can look out to the Potomac River, Jefferson Memorial, Washington
Monument, and other highlights of the D.C. skyline. Rooms come with
more than the usual amenities, including large bathrooms, three phones,
high-speed Internet access, 24-hour room service, and twice-daily house-
keeping. Suites on the upper floors have high-definition televisions.
Replicas of Asian art from the Smithsonian’s Freer and Sackler galleries
hang throughout the Mandarin, and the hotel has its own gallery with
rotating exhibits. CityZen, one of Washington’s very best restaurants, is
on-site, as are Cafe MoZU, which serves good breakfast, lunch, tea, and
dinner, and the Empress Lounge, where you can get drinks and light fare

Morrison-Clark Historic Inn and Restaurant
$$
Penn Quarter
History and attentive service are hallmarks of this charming hotel that
waits for gentrification at the northeast edge of the Penn Quarter arts and
entertainment district. The name comes from the families who lived in the
two Victorian mansions that were combined to create the hotel. Built in
1864, the mansions now are listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. The rooms are individually decorated, some with period antiques.
Antiques also are on display throughout the public areas. Some rooms that
face L Street have porches and are particularly attractive. If you value
peace and quiet, ask for a room on the inner courtyard. If you’re here
between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday from spring into fall, step out-
side for the “Big Easy on the Veranda” — free hors d’oeuvres and a cash
bar. Try the house specialty, the vodka-and-Cointreau-based Steel Magnolia.

Foggy Bottom/West End
All but 10 of this hotel’s 151 units have kitchens, and most have balconies.
Among the deluxe touches: coffee beans and a grinder to use with the cof-
feemaker. All the units also have a free high-speed Internet connection,
two-line cordless telephones, a stereo with a CD player, and a video-game
console. The most luxurious units — the “grande staterooms” — feature
a separate bedroom with king-size bed, a dining area with table and six
chairs, living area with sofa bed, and a bathroom and a half. Even the sim-
plest “guest quarters” feel spacious, with sleeping and sitting areas in one
large room that includes a double bed and fold-out sofa or two double
beds. The strikingly modern décor is warmed with dark wood and fabrics
in beige, gold, and blue. You can take advantage of an on-site fitness

Hardly. Close to the Convention Center, Verizon Center (sports and big-

ness travelers and families. A king room includes a large desk in work area

Downtown
This hotel has been hosting big events since it opened in 1925; Cal
Coolidge’s inauguration was celebrated here. The Mayflower is big, luxu-
rious, and the setting for many meetings, conventions, and other public
events. You can bump into any big shot here. The guest rooms, as well as
the public areas, feature marble and mahogany. They also have your basic
modern traveler’s necessities — two-line phones, speaker phones, voice
mail, and dataports. Parents can obtain cribs and child care. The hotel has
a restaurant, coffee shop, lounge, 24-hour room service, concierge serv-
ices, and exercise equipment. The location is ideal — midway between
Dupont Circle and the White House, on top of the Farragut North Metrorail
station. Discounted rates sometimes drop as low as $139.

Ritz-Carlton Washington
$$$$$
Foggy Bottom/West End
This may be Washington’s most luxurious hotel — in terms of both facili-
ties and services. You can choose, for example, a 2,250-square-foot suite:
living room with fireplace, bedroom, dining room with seating for ten,
Jacuzzi, and private terrace. Or you can stay on the private Club Level,
where you get a key for the elevator, the lounge offers food and beverage
service all day, and a concierge is at your beck and call. If you like package
deals, the Ritz offered a special for the 2005 presidential inauguration 
that included private jet transportation, a personal butler, inaugural ball
tickets — and other stuff — for $150,000. The standard rooms feature
marble in the bathrooms, goose down or nonallergenic pillows to suit your
need, dataports, portable phones, and high-speed Internet access. And
then you have the “fitness center,” the adjacent Sports Club/LA — 100,000
square feet of just about any exercise and sports facility you can dream of
for $12 a day. But it’s the service that really marks the Ritz. Beyond daily
attentiveness, managers here think creatively about what additional serv-
ices you might want. For example, noting increased air-travel hassles, the
hotel introduced “luggage-less” travel for frequent guests. Leave your
clothes in your room, and the hotel will launder, dry clean, press, store
them, and then place them in your room when you return. And, on your way
out of D.C., grab some of the hotel’s “flight bites” to eat on the airplane.

The River Inn

Foggy Bottom/West End
The facilities and services at this all-suites hotel focus on the needs of 
business travelers. But the kitchens in all units and separate bedrooms in
some — coupled with discounts that can drop below $100 — make the
River Inn a good option for families as well. Business travelers especially
appreciate the large desk and good lighting, the lack of which drives me
crazy in many hotels. Every unit also comes with free high-speed Internet
access, sofa bed, dressing alcove with vanity, and grinder with beans to
use with the coffeemaker. The studios feel spacious. The one-bedroom
suites are truly large, with two or three couches and king-size beds. The
hotel also has an exercise facility.

called Le Bar, plus interior décor and staff uniforms created by French
designers. Rooms in this 1928 office building — renovated and opened as
a hotel in 2002 — are bright, airy, and cheerful. Velvet curtains, thick car-
peting, rich-colored upholstery, and black lacquered desks with chrome
legs provide the feel of luxury. The overall effect is a melding of early-20th-
century Art Deco with 21st-century style and amenities. The bathrooms
have separate tubs and showers. You can order room service around the

can save money by cooking meals in the suites’ kitchens. On a quiet Foggy
Bottom block, the State Plaza feels like a private residence in a condo or
apartment building. Spacious is the operative word. The largest suites (the
Grand Plaza) have a master bedroom, living room with queen sofa bed and
easy chair, a stylish and well-equipped kitchen, and a separate dining area.

been cobbled together from adjacent buildings that measure their age in
centuries. The Tabard isn’t that old, but it was created from three adjacent
Chapter 9: Checking In at D.C.’s Best Hotels 117

Victorian town houses on a tree-lined street in the Dupont Circle neigh-
borhood. Each of the 40 rooms is different, and they’re furnished with a
combination of antiques and — uh, well — pre-owned items. They’re
priced according to their size, view, location within the hotel, and whether
they have private bathrooms (five don’t). All rooms come with free conti-
nental breakfast and free admission to the Tabard’s fabulously equipped
health club — the Capital YMCA around the corner. The Tabard’s restau-
rant is wonderful, both for the setting and the New American cuisine. You
can dine in the garden in warm weather or sip a drink beside a fireplace
when it’s cold. The lounge is the proverbial comfortable old shoe, a well-
worn place for luxuriating by the fire, not for luxury. Be warned that the
Tabard has no elevator.

Willard InterContinental
$$$$$
Downtown
The Willard is another Washington hotel steeped in history. A stone’s
throw from the White House and the D.C. government’s headquarters, it’s
been a prime spot for the powerful and the power-seekers to hang their
hats since even before Henry Willard bought the old hotel that occupied
the site in 1850. Abraham Lincoln stayed for a while in Henry’s hostelry.
And Calvin Coolidge lived in the current building until Mrs. Harding
vacated the White House following her husband’s death in 1923. Heads of
foreign states stay here now. The current Willard — built in 1901, closed in
1968, opened after a thorough restoration in 1986, and given a major face-
lift in 2000 — is a large, ornate, and luxurious domicile. Take a walk through
Peacock Alley, the first-floor hallway, even if you don’t stay here, and take
a peek into the opulent Willard Room restaurant. If you do stay here, you’ll
have a room furnished in antique reproductions and equipped with the
latest electronics. The Jenny Lind Suite has a canopy bed and a Jacuzzi
that sits beneath a large, circular window that centers on the Washington
Monument. The 3,000-square-foot Thomas Jefferson Suite sports an oval
dining room that seats ten and looks down Pennsylvania Avenue to the
Capitol, a master bedroom with sitting area, a living room, and two bath-
rooms, one with a Jacuzzi. You can have it for $4,200 a night. Occasionally

The B&B Alternative
Many people associate bed-and-breakfast facilities with the New England
countryside or some quaint small town. In fact, Washington houses quite
a few B&Bs in a broad range of prices and styles of living. You can spend
what you would at a luxury hotel and be treated like royalty. You can find
terrific bargains at small guesthouses. What you’re sure to encounter at
the B&Bs introduced to you here are clean rooms, comfortable sur-
roundings, and a personal hospitality you would be hard-pressed to 
find at any hotel.
D.C. Guest House
$$$
Downtown
This 19th-century mansion is a wonderful find a bit off the beaten tourist
track but just 1 block from the D.C. convention center. It’s just what you’re
looking for in a B&B — a building with character, decorated according to
the personalities of the owners who provide attentive service because
they really want their guests to enjoy their stay. The four owners have
appointed the house with modern furnishings, original art, and African
artifacts. The eclectic ambience ranges from country manor to urban chic.
Guest rooms are large, warm, and comfortable. Two rooms have working
fireplaces, and most have private bathrooms. All rooms have wireless
Internet access, satellite TV, DVD player, and access to DVDs. You’re
served a gourmet breakfast in an elegant dining room. Almost unheard of
in Washington, you can park your car for free about a block away. As one
of the owners pointed out to me, that puts your car closer to your room
here than it would be in the parking garage of many large hotels. The
owners, by the way, really know how to shop in Washington. So, if shop-
ping’s your thing, ask them for suggestions.

Excellent location and excellent price mark this homey B&B on a relatively

You’re 3 blocks from the elevator and 4 blocks from the escalator at the
Woodley Park-Zoo Metrorail station, where you can catch the Blue Line to
Washington’s top sights. When you get back, you can unwind with cookies
and lemonade in the afternoon or sip some sherry in the evening. A single
room costs as little as $55, and a double is $60. The highest price is $135
for a two-room suite, with private bathroom, that sleeps up to six. No TV
or phone in rooms. Some rooms share bathrooms.

Dupont Circle
Stay here and you can pretend you’re visiting rich relatives at the turn of

furnished to the opulence it probably displayed in the early 20th century.
You have the run not only of your room, but of the entire first floor and
the second-floor balcony. Both are splendid for sitting and reading, chat-
ting, or just soaking up the ambience. This preservation of the past is not
done at the expense of modern amenities. In addition to fireplaces in some
rooms and suites, a couple also sport Jacuzzis. One mind-bending bath-
room has a high domed ceiling over an enormous bathtub and a giant rain
shower. All rooms have private bathrooms, robes, satin sheets, down pil-
lows, feather beds, TVs, phones, and free Internet access. (If you’re aller-
gic to feathers, the innkeepers will give you synthetic bedding.) If you want
a VCR or DVD player, ask. There’s also an in-ground pool — something you
don’t find very often in this densely developed neighborhood.

Dining and Snacking 
in Washington, D.C.
In This Chapter
 Understanding Washington’s eating habits
 Reviewing the best restaurants in all price ranges
 Finding snacks and meals to go
T
here’s a joke around Washington that you can identify the world’s
trouble spots by checking out the new restaurants in town. People flee
trouble overseas, whether it’s famine, war, or oppression. Washington —
the capital of the free world — is a beacon. Many refugees have started on
the road to the American Dream by opening a restaurant. As a result,
Vietnamese, Ethiopian, Afghan, and other exotic cuisines took root in 
the nation’s capital when times were particularly bad in the lands that
spawned them. Washington’s international influences and community 
provide a hungry and knowledgeable audience for the Chinese, French,
German, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Thai, Latin American, and
Middle Eastern restaurants you can find here. And, with Congress repre-
senting every corner of America, a variety of regional cuisines from
throughout the United States are represented as well.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
This section brings you up to speed on a few trends and technicalities
before you get down to the business of eating. You can find more news
about D.C. dining in the Washington Post (www.washingtonpost.com),
and Washingtonian magazine (www.washingtonian.com). Click “City
Guide” on the Post’s home page, and “Restaurants” on Washingtonian’s.
The current trends
A key sign that Washington’s dining scene really is on a long-term up-tick
is the creativity and diversity of its food and chefs.

 The number one trend right now is sheer quality. This is a big deal,
because it wasn’t so long ago that the nation’s capital was consid-
ered the nation’s backwater when it came to food. Now, however, a
few really, really good restaurants open each year, adding to D.C.’s
expanding roster of top-notch dining spots. Among the most recent
additions: the New American CityZen, whose chef, Eric Ziebold,
previously cooked at California’s famed French Laundry, and the
Modern Indian Rasika, where chef Vikram Sunderam works the
magic he nurtured first in India and England. They join such estab-
lished world-class venues as the Italian Galileo, Kinkead’s seafood
restaurant, the French/Belgian Marcel’s, the French/Californian
Michel Richard Citronelle, and the French Le Paradou.
 The biggest things in Washington dining right now continue to be
little things, and that’s a trend that’s accelerating. We’ve discov-
ered the pleasure of strolling into a good restaurant with a group of
friends, ordering nice wine, and spending several hours sharing
nibbles of small dishes. Mediterranean meze is on the menu at
Zaytinya, a strikingly stylish new restaurant in the Penn Quarter
arts-theater-entertainment district. Jaleo, in the same neighbor-
hood and in two suburbs, offers an enormous choice of Spanish
tapas. At Mini Bar, a special section within Café Atlántico (also in
the neighborhood), Chef José Andrés whips up tiny creations that
spring from his mind rather than one particular cuisine — potato
mousse with caviar and vanilla oil, for example, or foie gras sur-
rounded by cotton candy! Head up to Dupont Circle and dip little
pieces of meats, fruits, vegetables, and breads into hot pots of
cheeses, broths, and melted chocolate at the Melting Pot, a fondue
emporium. In Upper Northwest, 2 Amys offers Italian tidbits along
with its superb Neapolitan pizzas. The best way to sample the
superb cuisine at the aforementioned Rasika is to pick among
Sunderam’s many small-plate offerings.
 The other great trend, which also continues to accelerate, is the
proliferation of not-your-father’s hotel restaurants. A growing
number of Washington hostelries are turning their dining space
over to great chefs. CityZen is in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, for
instance, and Michel Richard Citronelle in the Latham. Other very
good hotel restaurants include Poste in the Hotel Monaco, Circle
Bistro in One Washington Circle Hotel, Bistro Bis in the Hotel
George, and the Tabard Inn in, well, the Tabard Inn.
The lunch scene
Washingtonians do lunch in just about every way imaginable. The infa-
mous three-martini lunch has pretty much faded into the past. But busi-
ness lunches remain a big deal — a way for lobbyists, lawmakers,
administrators, political operatives, and journalists to share info in a
relaxed setting without cutting into their crowded business days. Most
Washingtonians on most days, however, gobble quick soups and sand-
wiches in lunch rooms, grab sandwiches and soft drinks and head for a

What this routine means to you is that you can find lots of spots for
grabbing decent quick lunches. And, because many of the top restau-
rants are open for lunch, you can sample some of the city’s best dining
in smaller portions for smaller prices at midday.
Eating like a local
Both high-class and inexpensive eateries are scattered throughout the
city. Here’s what makes some neighborhoods distinctive, food-wise.
 Capitol Hill: Despite their low standing with the general public,
members of Congress and their aides are in general a hard-working
bunch, so you can find lots of spots for quick lunches on Capitol
Hill. Restaurants, cafeterias, and carry-outs are scattered through-
out the Capitol and the congressional office buildings. The food
court on the bottom floor of Union Station is one of the largest and
most diverse you’ll find anywhere.
 Downtown: This area is Washington’s business center, so you can
find many fine-dining establishments, plus delis and sandwich
shops, on most corners. Buy a sandwich, chips, and soft drink and
find a nearby park for people-watching.
 Georgetown, Dupont Circle, Adams-Morgan, Penn Quarter: These
areas are D.C.’s party spots, so lots of vibrant restaurants and
saloons line the streets. You can eat, drink, dance, and check out
the street scenes. What’s left of Chinatown — a fair number of
Chinese restaurants and the Chinatown Gate — occupies a north-
ern section of Penn Quarter.
 The National Mall: The Mall is lined with museums and galleries,
and the bigger ones will feed your stomach as well as your eyes.
You also can find a lot of street vendors nearby, hawking hot dogs,
sausages, chips, candy, and soft drinks.
Making reservations
While you can find lots of spots for lunch without much of a fuss or wait,
accomplishing this feat is a bit trickier later in the day. Regarding restau-
rant dinner reservations: If you can make them, do!
If you know your plans, make your reservations several days in
advance — even before you leave home. Reserve for lunch, too, if you
can. Otherwise, you can decrease the size of the lunch lines you wait in
by arriving before 11:45 a.m. or after 1:30 p.m.
If you’re a Web head, you can make reservations at many D.C. restau-
rants by surfing over to OpenTable at www.opentable.com and clicking
on the “Washington” link. OpenTable also provides descriptions of the
restaurants, reviews, maps, and links to the restaurants’ Web sites.

Dressing to dine
Washington is a working town, so it’s filled with suits, wingtips, and sen-
sible pumps. You’ll encounter them in restaurants at breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, as well as in government, media, and business offices. But
Washington has a pretty forgiving dress code. Few restaurants block
your entrance if you’re dressed more casually. (I note those that do in
the reviews that follow.) I doubt you’ll get thrown out of many places for
wearing jeans, although you may feel out of place at the nicer restau-
rants. If you love to dress up, go for it. Washingtonians don’t look down
on you for that, either. Though I wouldn’t recommend it, you can wear a
tux most places without raising eyebrows. Enough black-tie affairs occur
in this town that people are used to seeing the penguin look on Metrorail
or hustling down the street.
Smoking in restaurants
By law, Washington’s restaurants and bars now are smoke-free, except
for cigar and hookah bars and outdoor areas such as sidewalk cafes. The
ban also covers offices and apartment building lobbies. The law lets you
smoke in your hotel room. Establishments, of course, are free to impose
stricter limitations of their own, and smoke-free hotel rooms have
become pretty ubiquitous.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Spending oodles on noodles (and steak and swordfish) is easy in D.C.,
but it’s not required. Here are some suggestions for keeping your food
bill under control:
 When you want to sample an expensive restaurant, do so at
lunchtime. You can still get the acclaimed food, but you don’t pay
so much.
 Buy carryout and picnic on a park bench or on the National Mall.
You can find many lovely, shaded spots among the memorials.
 Take advantage of fixed-price, early bird, pre-theater, and post-
theater menus. Check your watch as well as the hours restaurants
offer specials. If you arrive five minutes late, you’ll pay full price.
You snooze, you lose.
 Split appetizers and desserts — and even main courses — with
your dining companions. Many restaurants serve sinfully large por-
tions. If you have access to a refrigerator and microwave, ask for
doggie bags. You can heat up the leftovers for an in-room meal —
like room service without the service (or the service fee).
 Ask the prices of the dishes that are described by the waiter
rather than listed on the menu. They can shock you.

Washington’s Best Restaurants
Now it’s finally time to feed your faces, folks! While you loosen your belt
buckle, I’ll help you figure out where you’d like to eat.
I’ve compiled reviews of the best restaurants in all price ranges, arranged
alphabetically for easy reference. The price range, location, and the type
of cuisine follow each restaurant’s name. After the reviews, you can find
all the restaurants indexed by location, so you can find a place near the
attractions you visit, by price, so that you can budget accordingly, and
by cuisine, so that you can satisfy your individual tastes. The restaurants
also are marked on handy maps.
Restaurants designated as kid-friendly in this chapter have a kids’ menu
and/or cuisine that appeals to a younger palate.
Each review contains two price indicators. There’s a dollar symbol, for a
quick look at the average price of a dinner without beverages. I also list
the range of prices for main courses on the restaurant’s menu. I added
up the costs of the least expensive and most expensive appetizer or
salad, main course, and dessert at dinner, not including taxes and tips,
and then averaged the highest- and lowest-priced meals to come up with
the dollar-sign ranking.
Prices change over time, and the cost of your meal obviously depends on
what you order. One reason I don’t include beverage costs in my price
categories is that ordering top-shelf cocktails and expensive wines can
produce a $$$$$ bill at a $$$ restaurant. Sticking to a lower-priced entree
and drinking coffee (or water) can squeeze a $$$$ restaurant into a $$$
bill (not that I recommend water over wine at gourmet restaurants).
Here’s what you can expect meals to cost. Prices in Table 10-1 are per
person, not including drinks.

Amma Indian Vegetarian Kitchen
$
Georgetown
INDIAN/VEGETARIAN
Amma is a wonderful example of the amusing diversity of Georgetown.
This quiet, unassuming restaurant — with quiet, unassuming staff — sits
right next to the Jinx Proof Tattoos & Piercing Parlor on bustling M Street.
Amma offers you numerous ways to sample Indian vegetarian cooking at
bargain prices. If you’re new to Indian cuisine, try one of the house spe-
cials, which let you sample several dishes.

Austin Grill
$$
Penn Quarter and Upper Northwest
SOUTHWESTERN
Our family hits the Austin Grill often. You get good Tex-Mex food in a festive
atmosphere served by friendly staff. The grill gives you lots of choices. You
can make a meal from several appetizers. Vegetarians may like the porto-
bello mushroom and spinach quesadilla, although I think it would benefit
from some extra spices. I like the Austin Special — one chicken and one
cheese enchilada covered with three sauces. The kids’ menu has Tex-Mex
dishes, along with burgers, a PB&J sandwich, carrot and celery sticks, and
free ice cream for dessert. The original, which is a bit funky, is on Wisconsin
Avenue above Georgetown. Tourists are more likely to encounter the new
and spacious grill in the Penn Quarter arts-and-entertainment area near
MCI Center.

Bistro Bis
$$$$
Capitol Hill
FRENCH
The food at Bistro Bis is an excellent modern American interpretation of
classic French bistro and brasserie cooking. The setting represents a
modern American nod toward classic bistro style. From the zinc bar with
two-story mirror to the spacious leather booths, Bis is eye-catching, com-
fortable, bustling, and noisy. The menu changes frequently, so I can’t tell you
for sure what you’ll find. When Susan and I last dined here, we especially
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 133

liked our main courses — roasted chicken with a sauce that included bits of
bacon and spinach, and pan roasted rockfish. For dessert, the passion fruit
mousse in a chocolate cup with raspberries is tart and refreshing. The
caramel and chocolate tart is rich. The simplest dishes — grilled tuna,
seared salmon, or braised short ribs, for example — often are the best. Also
very good are seared sea scallops with garlic, tomato, olives, parsley, and
eggplant.

Bistrot Du Coin
$$$
Dupont Circle
FRENCH
This noisy, bustling, crowded place is jam-packed with people who are
enjoying their food and each other’s company. The long, narrow, high-
ceilinged, brightly lighted room with wooden tables covered by butcher
paper feels just like a Paris hangout, where everybody knows the waiters,
the waitresses, the bartenders, and the clientele. Sit on the caned chairs,
try to translate the French signs on the walls, and admire the French
prints. Du Coin serves very good French comfort food — beef burgundy,
roast chicken, rabbit stew, snails with garlic butter, and the like. The menu
is huge and includes soups, salads, pâtés, sandwiches, and, of course,
dessert. If you’re partial to Roquefort cheese — which I am — start your
feast by ordering the green salad with Roquefort, walnuts, croutons, and
a tangy dressing. The mushroom soup’s yummy, too.

Bistrot Lepic & Wine Bar
$$$
Georgetown
FRENCH
This neighborhood gathering place in upper Georgetown is filled with
diplomats, world travelers, and others who revel in real French food. Chef
Bruno Fortin began to learn the art of French cooking in his parents’
restaurant in Brittany, then hopped around Europe and North America
before settling into Washington and opening Lepic (named for a street he
lived on in Paris) in 1995. Like other good French chefs in America, Fortin
offers traditional French dishes and his own improvisations on them. Start
with the mussel soup with leeks and potatoes. Then try the grilled trout
with carrot sauce, potato-crusted salmon, or sautéed sea scallops with
ginger broccoli mousse. The dining room is small, bustling, and pleasant,

with sunny yellow walls. Fortin added a second-floor wine bar to create
space for drinking and nibbling appetizers.

The Brickskeller
$$
Dupont Circle
AMERICAN
If you’ve left your college days long behind you, visiting the Brickskeller
may make you think you’ve gone back. Your college town has to have a
(smaller) tavern like this one. It’s got red brick walls. It’s got red-and-white
checkered tablecloths. It’s got beer cans and bottles as a primary deco-
rating motif. It’s got Janis Joplin on the jukebox. It’s got surprisingly good
food. And, my, does it have beer — more than 1,000 brands are advertised.
The fish and chips here are really good. The juicy burgers, spicy chicken
wings, and French fries also are good choices. You get an enormous pile of
fried onion rings for $3.95. If you crave alternatives to standard pub fare,
you can order pasta, salmon, beef steak, and several renditions of buffalo
(not the kind with wings).

B. Smith’s
$$$$
Capitol Hill
SOUTHERN
Under the ornate, soaring Beaux Arts ceiling of what once was the
President’s Room in Union Station, Washingtonians now dine on innova-
tive versions of Southern, Cajun, and Creole cooking. Share the red beans
and rice appetizer before diving into your main courses. B. Smith’s house
special is called Swamp Thing, with mixed seafood over greens in a mustard-
based seafood sauce. Executive Chef Rahman Harper also has come up
with a dish he calls Southern Surf & Turf — fried lobster tail and molasses
braised short ribs with shitake quinoa. Traditional jazz groups entertain 
on Friday and Saturday nights. Because of the 30-foot ceilings and hard
surfaces, this place can get noisy.

Bullfeathers
$$
Capitol Hill
AMERICAN
Because of its location near the Capitol and the price and quality of its
food and drink, Bullfeathers is a prime lunch, dinner, and elbow-bending
spot for House staffers and the journalists who cover them when Congress
is in session. When Congress shuts down — around the year-end holidays,
for instance — you could hold a paint-ball tournament in here and not hit
anybody. Most people come for the burgers and other sandwiches, but the
restaurant offers a full dinner menu. There are lots of munchie specials
from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Saturday and drink specials from 4 to 8
p.m. The restaurant says its name comes from Teddy Roosevelt’s favorite
euphemism, which is slung around quite a bit during those aforemen-
tioned congressional sessions.

Busboys and Poets
$$
U Street Corridor
AMERICAN
This hip gathering place is a restaurant, bookstore, theater, bar, coffee
house, and Internet cafe rolled into one. The food is good and the enter-
tainment eclectic at this new addition to the rapidly gentrifying section of
U Street. Busboys and Poets draws writers, activists, singles, and families.
The restaurant serves salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and burgers. You also

Café La Ruche

Georgetown
FRENCH
My wife and daughter like to eat in this little restaurant off Georgetown’s
beaten path because it reminds them of France. From the outside, you can
imagine it as a house in the French countryside (if you ignore the sur-
rounding buildings). Inside, it’s like a well-worn neighborhood hangout in
Paris (though the TV at one end of the dining room intrudes upon the fan-
tasy). Unfortunately, at times, indifferent service can remind you of Paris
as well. To start, try the traditional French onion soup. You can make a
meal of the salade Niçoise. The quiches are delicious. And the desserts are
wonderful. (Get the fruit tart, and you can pretend it’s health food. I do.)
Weekend brunch, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., is a treat and, at $11, is one of the
best bargains in town. When the weather’s nice, you can eat outside.

TEXAS BARBECUE
How’s this for incongruity? In Washington’s Chinatown stands a tiny
restaurant with autographed pictures of U.S. politicians on the walls and
Texas barbecue on the menu. Most of the politicians are Texans, which is
appropriate since this restaurant is run by transplanted Texan Nick
Fontana. Capital Q is authentic enough to attract Texas expatriate diners
and was picked to cater the party that House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(of Texas) threw for 4,000 of his closest friends at the 2000 Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia. Order the beef brisket or pulled pork

CHINESE
Good food served by a friendly staff in pleasant surroundings — what
more do you want in a Chinese restaurant? City Lights has a large and
varied menu, and the owners invite you to ask the chef to accommodate
your personal tastes. My family has become especially fond of the hot-and-
sour soup, spring rolls, and Seafood Delight (shrimp, scallops, crab, and
vegetables stir-fried in a light sauce). The restaurant is also noted for its
Peking duck, eggplant with garlic, and tangy Szechwan lamb. Many veg-
etable dishes are on the menu. In addition to serving you inside, City Lights
has a substantial takeout menu and delivers to nearby hotels. Keep that
thought in mind if you want to picnic on a park bench or collapse in your
room after a particularly grueling day of seeing the sights.

CityZen
$$$$$
Tidal Basin
MODERN AMERICAN
There’s still a buzz about CityZen, even though it really can no longer be
considered a new restaurant, having opened in 2004. The warm colors and
soft lighting make this a welcoming, soothing room, with a touch of
whimsy. Windows along one wall reach from the floor to the high ceiling.
Enormous lamps — shaped like normal table lamps — fit with the soaring
height of the room. You can glimpse Chef Eric Ziebold and his assistants
preparing your dinner in the open kitchen. You know a great deal of care
has gone into preparing an exquisite dining experience when the chef sends
out several amuse-bouche offerings to begin the meal — on our visit a tasty
mushroom fritter, a thin pumpkin soup to be sipped from a small cup, and
a quail egg and ham salad which the waiter offers to top with shaved black
salt from the Himalayas. Three styles of bread arrive with two kinds of
butter, one identified as sweet butter from Pennsylvania, the other as lightly
salted butter from Vermont. You order from a tasting menu — $75 for 
three courses, $90 for five, $80 for a five-course vegetarian tasting. The 
five-course menu is set by the chef. You’re given a half-dozen choices for
each course of the three-course tasting. Vegetarians can piece together 
a three-course veggie dinner as well. The selections change frequently, so
making recommendations is problematic. The best of our tastings were
two appetizers, artichoke ravioli, and a tartiflette with duck confit; a main
course of poached fluke topped with lemon sauce and salty, buttery sea
urchin; and two complex desserts, a poached pineapple guava with rose-
mary cake and guava sorbet, and a poached pear with pastry and candied
walnut ice cream. CityZen offers a large selection of wines by the glass
priced from $10 to $20.

Clyde’s
$$
Georgetown, Penn Quarter, Upper Northwest
AMERICAN
Like its sibling Old Ebbitt Grill, Clyde’s of Georgetown was one of my
favorite places to eat when I managed to find an excuse to visit Washington
long before we moved here. Then, it was a comfortable old saloon with
some unusually good food, especially (to my taste) the omelets. A 1996
renovation modernized the place, while aiming to maintain a saloonlike
atmosphere — oak bar, plank flooring, checkered tablecloths. But the
Garden Room now looks like all those other family-friendly pubs that hang
artifacts all over the place. In this case, models of antique airplanes dangle
below the skylight. Clyde’s is still a place for hamburgers and other bar
fare, but the ever-changing menu is quite ambitious, with special attention
to incorporating fresh produce from mid-Atlantic farms. Always order the
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 139

light and fluffy omelet if it’s offered. We’ve also had good luck ordering
pear salad with blue cheese and walnuts, linguine with mussels, rockfish,
and crab cakes. Clyde’s is a local chain now, with Clyde’s of Chevy Chase
feeding shoppers in the Friendship Heights upscale shopping area that I
call Washington’s Little Rodeo Drive, and Clyde’s of Gallery Place hosting
hordes of revelers in the Penn Quarter arts and entertainment district.

more expensive opportunity to taste additional outstanding dishes in
Laboratorio, a private dining room where a 10- to 12-course tasting menu

is served for $110 on weekdays and $125 on weekends, with an additional
$75 option for matched wines. Now he’s gone the opposite direction, and
he’s added bargain-priced meals at lunch and dinner in the bar area 
and outdoors in nice weather. Donna calls the bar area Osteria del Galileo,
and offers lunch and dinner guests appetizers, pastas, main courses, side
dishes, and desserts for $12 or less. On some days at lunch in nice weather,
he sets up a grill outside and conjures up chicken, pork, sausage, and
meatball sandwiches for $5 to $6. You have to call or get on his e-mail list
to find out when Galileo’s grilling. Epicures are advised to reserve well

Dining with Dubya: Politico hangouts
So you wonder where the president likes to grab a bite outside the White House? Or
where members of Congress and lobbyists feed their faces and bend their elbows
between roll calls?
Well, President George W. Bush isn’t known to frequent D.C. eateries, and when he
does he seems to choose modest digs. Like his father, he’s shown up at the Peking
Gourmet Inn in suburban Falls Church, Virginia (6029 Leesburg Pike; % 703-671-8088).
My daughter ran into him one night at the Cactus Cantina (3300 Wisconsin Ave. NW,
1 block north of the National Cathedral; % 202-686-7222), a good Tex-Mex spot.
(Ironically, she had stopped there before going off on a school field trip to see a play that
was highly critical of an execution Bush approved when he was Texas governor.)
Nevertheless, one of her bolder classmates approached the president and asked whether
he would pose for a picture with the group, and he graciously agreed. Then, every kid with
a cellphone — whether red state or blue state in their political leanings — immediately
called relatives and friends to tell who was eating at the next table.
You’ll find senators, lobbyists, and Supreme Court justices at The Monocle; senators,
lobbyists, and Senate staffers at the Dubliner; Senate staffers and lobbyists at Bistro
Bis. House staffers and the occasional representative frequent Bullfeathers. White
House folks hit the nearby Occidental and Old Ebbitt Grill.
The number-one see-and-be-seen place in town is The Palm. You might bump into lob-
byists at any of the preceding restaurants because their jobs revolve around govern-
ment folks, and they have the expense accounts to afford it.

ebrating a birthday. Garrett’s menu features soups, salads, pasta, burgers,

the “Huntington Hash” — pulled chicken and roasted potatoes topped with
gravy and served with fresh fruit and coleslaw. Desserts include such
down-home favorites as bread pudding, brownie a la mode, apple crisp,

SOUTHERN
Ready for some “nouveau soul food”? That’s how the chef once described
the cuisine at Georgia Brown’s, a Southern restaurant that bases its cook-
ing on the traditions of South Carolina’s Low Country — with a twist. And
just what does that produce? How about fried green tomatoes stuffed with
herbed cream cheese, served on green tomato relish with lemon-cayenne
mayonnaise and watercress? It’s a superb, rich dish that four can share as
an appetizer or side dish. Or what about sweet potato cheesecake? Or a
vegetarian croquette? You can find plenty of traditional home cooking, too,
like fried chicken, pork chops, catfish, gumbo, shrimp, and grits. This New
South is vegetarian-friendly, with several veggie selections on the menu,
including a sampler. Portions are large. The dining room is warm and
comfy. A popular jazz brunch occurs from 10 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. Sunday. The

Hank’s Oyster Bar
$$$
Dupont Circle
SEAFOOD
Anxious to hang out her own shingle after succeeding famously at the
hotel restaurant 15ria, Chef Jamie Leeds decided to open a local dining
spot in her own neighborhood near Dupont Circle. The result is this small
seafood house, inspired by the Pearl Oyster Bar in New York and named
for her late father, an avid fisherman. Oysters — raw and fried — are, of
course, the first order of business here, along with other seafood dishes,
notably crab cakes, lobster rolls, oyster po’ boys, calamari, popcorn
shrimp, and clams. But Leeds was known for comfort cooking at 15ria, and
she’s brought her “meats and two” specials to Hank’s. That would be two
sides with a meat dish such as molasses-braised short ribs, smothered
pork chops, or roasted chicken. For weekend brunch (11 a.m.–3 p.m.), she
adds sourdough French toast and crab-cake eggs Benedict to the menu.
Following the neighborly theme, Leeds offers fish sticks, french fries, ham-
burgers, and macaroni-and-cheese for the kids. Leeds shops for fresh pro-
duce at the Dupont Circle farmers’ market in season, and buys oysters
from oyster farmers whose standards she has checked. This is a small
restaurant with tightly packed tables, and it doesn’t take reservations. If
you don’t like crowds or waiting for a table, come before or after normal
meal times.

Loosely translated, jaleo means revelry or racket. Neither is in short
supply at this lively, colorful tapas bar and restaurant with walls of win-

perusing a menu of 50 tapas and main courses. Because sharing is an
unspoken rule, Jaleo is fun with a group. The Sunday brunch (11:30 a.m.–
3 p.m.) attracts locals en route to a nearby attraction or an afternoon
siesta. You can graze here nightly for a week and not sample everything.
Because I like so many things here, it’s hard to focus on a few recommen-
dations. Let me do my duty and steer you toward the spinach sautéed with
pine nuts, apples, and raisons; chorizo sausage with garlic mashed pota-
toes; roasted eggplant with onions; fried calamari; grilled asparagus; and
garlic shrimp. Don’t eat too many of these choices, though, because you
must sample dessert — and share it, too. The warm Basque cake with
cream, cinnamon-vanilla sauce, and ice cream is wonderful, as is the flan
and the chocolate-nut mousse. A world-traveler friend declared Jaleo’s cafe
con leche “compares favorably with what I’ve had in Mexico and Spain.”

Le Paradou
$$$$$
Penn Quarter
FRENCH
If you’ve got 150 bucks to spend on a nine-course tasting menu, Le Paradou
is the place for you. Superstar chef Yannick Cam and business partner
Michael Klein have spared no effort or expense in offering the finest dining
experience at this contemporary French restaurant, which opened in mid-
2004. The earth-toned décor with commissioned contemporary art is ele-
gant but comfortable. From the pre-appetizer amuse of paper-thin smoked
salmon with crème fraîche to the dessert of thin crispy pastry, caramel ice
cream, nuts, and warm cherries and quince, the food is exquisite. Ask the
waiter’s advice when ordering à la carte. If you spring for a fixed-price meal
and something doesn’t strike your fancy (put off by foie gras?), ask the
waiter to suggest a substitute. Be really nice, and maybe he’ll bring you
the post-dessert dessert, a plate of thumbnail-sized mini treats. I’ve heard
some complaints about the service recently, but no one questions the high
quality of the food. You can’t eat cheap here, but you can taste Chef Cam’s
cooking for a lot less in the attractive bar and lounge, at the sidewalk
tables in nice weather, or at lunch. Men are expected to wear jackets in the
main dining room.

potatoes, such as grilled vegetables and vegetarian pasta. Try the fried
sweet potatoes or gravied mashed potatoes. There’s a Blue Plate Special
every day (lasagna, fried chicken, pork ribs) and a Green Plate Special for
vegetarians (veggie pasta, portobello parmigiana). How ’bout apple pie
and ice cream for dessert? Luna entertains kids with whimsical murals on
the walls and booths — and with a menu that contains plenty of kid-

Malaysia Kopitiam
$$
Dupont Circle
MALAYSIAN
There’s a good chance you’ve never tasted Malaysian cooking. But, when
you do, it’ll remind you of other Asian cuisines, notably Chinese, Thai, and
Indian. Washington is blessed with a good Malaysian eatery ready to help
you understand the unfamiliar. First, the lengthy menu describes the
dishes and contains photos to show you what they look like. Next,
owner/host Leslie Phoon and his staff stand ready to answer questions
and offer advice. (His wife, Penny, is the chef.) On your way in, check the
chalkboard for specials. Try not to be distracted by the tiki bar décor. If
you want suggestions from me, try the wok wok shrimp. The shrimp are
served on a bed of lettuce with a sweetish cream sauce. A dining com-
panion likened beef hor fun — stir-fried flat rice noodles with beef, bean
sprouts, and Chinese spinach — to the ubiquitous Thai dish, pad thai.
Assam sambal shrimp is stir-fried with red onions and red peppers in a
spicy/sour sauce. Nyonya chicken is another spicy entree, this one with
cucumbers. If you’re not into hot stuff, don’t worry: An entire menu section
lists nonspicy entrees. Vegetarians will appreciate the section devoted to
vegetable dishes.

MOROCCAN
This Moroccan restaurant is just plain fun. Suspend your disbelief, and you

Greenstreet in old Casablanca. The adventure starts when you knock on
the closed front door, it opens, and you’re escorted through a curtain into
an enormous dimly lighted dining room decorated from floor to ceiling in
intricate colored patterns. After you settle into cushions around a low
brass table, you wash your hands, which are your primary eating utensils
for the evening. The seven-course meal is served family style, and you
scoop up the food with bread or your fingers. Think eggplant, cucumber,
phyllo pastry, almonds, cinnamon, olives, dates, raisons, honey, couscous,
two meat courses (one perhaps a kebab), fruit, pastries, and mint tea. This
place is most fun with a group — I’d say about ten people — but the restau-

Martin’s Tavern

Georgetown
AMERICAN
Martin’s is a real Washington institution. Every president since Harry
Truman has eaten here, and Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,
and Richard Nixon were Martin’s regulars when they served in Congress.
A huge proportion of Georgetown University students eat here, too, as do
Georgetown residents and other Washingtonians looking for an old-style,
neighborhood tavern in which to sip a beer, grab a bite, or enjoy nice
weather in the narrow sidewalk cafe. William S. Martin, a 19th-century Irish
immigrant, opened this place in 1933 with his son William G. The founder’s
great-grandson Billy and Billy’s wife Gina are the proprietors today. Tiffany
lamps and a mahogany bar mark the atmosphere inside. The menu runs to
crab cakes, corned beef and cabbage, fish and chips, Welsh rarebit, calves
liver, strip steak, burgers, and sandwiches.

The name no longer is quite appropriate for this formerly tiny pizza-and-

is what draws the hordes here. But Matchbox — which expanded in fall
2006 — offers a full menu that ranges from burgers to such entrees as
pepper-crusted yellowfin tuna on sesame sticky rice with stir-fried veg-
etables. I think the veggie pizza is especially good. Non-veggies should
check out the delicious and unusual crab cake in crispy phyllo pastry.

The Melting Pot
$$$$
Dupont Circle
FONDUE
As with Marrakesh, the Melting Pot is a great place to bring a group for a
festive evening of drinking and dipping and dining (although you also have
the choice of a “Lovers Lane” of dimly lighted booths for two). Here, how-
ever, you’re not dipping your fingers into the pot in front of you. (It’s not
recommended with boiling oil!) Instead, you’re strongly encouraged to use
fondue forks. The ambience here is a combination of sophisticated and
whimsical. The restaurant is modern and attractive. Lights come in the
shapes of forks and pots and tiny spots suspended over the tables. Don’t
worry if steam from your fondue pot obscures your dining companions
across the table. It’s from the boiling water beneath the cooking chamber.
(A member of my large party here once described the experience “like get-
ting a facial.”) The suggested way of proceeding is to begin with melted
cheese (my favorite is cheddar with beer, garlic, and other seasonings)
into which you dip breads, vegetables, and apples. The main course
(shrimp, steak, chicken, scallops, vegetables — even lobster) is dipped in
a hot broth. The burgundy-based broth seems best for beef, but many like
the simple oil because it doesn’t import its own taste to the foods being
cooked. You make dessert by dipping strawberries and other items — even
marshmallows — into melted chocolate. The more dippers in your party,
the more variations you can concoct with the different ingredients to heat
and to dip. “Fondue Feasts” — the Melting Pot’s version of tasting menus
from salad to dessert — serve two dippers for $82 to $92.

Chef Michel Richard has earned a reputation as one of the best French
chefs in America. His restaurant actually bills its offerings as “French/

offers fixed-price dinners from $85 to $150 and a chef’s table from $275 (all
before beverages). The appetizers may include a lobster tart, eggplant gaz-
pacho, or crab tempura. For the main course, how about roasted monk-
fish with spinach, oyster ravioli and watercress sauce, or wild rockfish
with crab risotto and saffron potato purée? For dessert, try a rich and
creamy raspberry vacherin cheese or petits fours. At these prices, gen-
tlemen are expected to wear a jacket — and to be gentlemen! You can eat
for less — but not for cheap — in the lounge or on the terrace. You also can
test Citronelle’s wares at breakfast. In addition to serving these haute cui-

the waiters sing. Fortunately, they deliver pretty good food. For starters, I
recommend the poached pear salad with apple, honey roasted walnuts,
cheese, greens, and cranberry vinaigrette. At the end, the Key lime pie is
refreshing, the chocolate soufflé tasty. In between, your choices range from
sandwiches to steak. Nightly specials and vegetarian options always grace

cessful run in the 2004 presidential campaign and spent most of his life on
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 149

the road. Now that he’s back as a rank-and-file senator, you may bump into
him here again. The Monocle staff is solicitous. Steak, lobster, and crab
cakes are popular items. The pork rib chop with pommery mustard sauce
is especially good. At lunch, go for the hamburger. Not surprisingly, the
menu also has a good selection of martinis.

Capitol Hill
FRENCH
Just a few blocks from the House office buildings and the U.S. Capitol, this
little restaurant reminds you of what you love about Paris. Appearances
outside and in — including the sidewalk cafe — suggest a modest eatery
on some French side street. The food tastes that way, too. The waitress
doesn’t speak clear English, but she does deliver a mean basket of crispy-
crusted French bread. From then on, you have to choose, and I suggest a
wonderful salad of endive, walnuts, and blue cheese to start. The sautéed
cod with garlic mashed potatoes makes for a homey main course, and the
roasted salmon with leeks and risotto tastes pretty darn good, too. For
dessert, there’s no contest. If it’s offered, grab the berry tart.

which you can have prepared mild or spicy. The sushi menu is large and
reasonably priced. Other popular dishes include drunken noodles (with
stir-fried minced chicken in basil, pepper, and onion sauce), spring rolls,
and chicken satay (with slightly spicy peanut sauce). The décor is sophis-

The Occidental quite likely fits your image of a Washington power hangout.

are covered with more than 2,000 autographed photos of Occidental
diners, from Buffalo Bill Cody through Huey Long and various Kennedys up
to Oprah Winfrey and contemporary politicians. The dining rooms (above
the grill is a more formal room with the same menu) were opened in 1986,
but the restaurant traces its roots on essentially the same site to 1906. The
Occidental had been known for steak and lobster, which remain on the
menu. But when Chef Rodney Scruggs took over in 2005, he started tempt-
ing diners with such offerings as she-crab soup, wild mushroom ravioli,
and a lamb salad. You can spend a lot less for a hamburger or other sand-
wich at lunch and still soak up the atmosphere.

SEAFOOD
This is a festive place that’s an especially good restaurant for larger par-

Oceanaire and feel as if they’ve stepped onto the set of a 1930s movie. The
menu evokes that earlier age, and the restaurant was designed to suggest
a 1930s ocean liner. The teens, however, debated whether they were sup-
posed to be inside a ship — or under water, because of the fish mounted
on the walls and the blue cast to the lighting. However you interpret the
décor, oyster lovers can choose among a dozen varieties. The crab cakes
are nearly all meat. The fried foods are tops. It’s hard to go wrong order-
ing the fresh fish broiled. Portions are large — for sharing or taking home
for another meal.

Old Ebbitt Grill
$$$
Downtown
AMERICAN
Before we moved to Washington, one of my favorite places to visit here
was the Old Ebbitt Grill, ensconced in a narrow, 19th-century building that
made you feel like Teddy Roosevelt might walk through the door. That
building was demolished in 1983, and the restaurant moved into new digs
just around the corner from the White House. The new Old Ebbitt is a large,
handsome establishment that evokes older times with mahogany, velvet,
marble, and brass, as well as collections of antique steins, hunting tro-
phies, and decoys. This place is a lunchtime and after-work gathering place
for folks employed in the area — including White House staffers — so
many customers order burgers and other bar fare. But the diverse menu
changes daily, featuring what’s fresh from local farmers, and there’s a sub-
stantial oyster bar. For me, the highlight of one visit — other than spotting
Newt Gingrich with his most recent wife — was superb strawberry short-
cake with whipped cream. The Virginia farm that produced the berries was
credited on the menu. The staff tends to be friendly and nice to kids, and
many kid-friendly items are on the menu — from the very good burgers to
finger-food appetizers.

STEAKHOUSE
This is the ultimate old-school Washington power place, even though it’s

autographed caricatures of Palm patrons past and present, many of whom
will be familiar to you. And you can spot regulars seated at their favorite
tables as easily as you can find them painted upon the walls. (Think Larry
King, James Carville, Tim Russert, and George Bush the First.) One time
Susan was here with an out-of-town companion, and no sooner finished
describing the place as a celebrity magnet when Carville walked in. The
Palm has billed itself as “the place to see and be seen,” and that certainly
is true. It’s also the place to eat large steaks (how about a 36-ounce New
York strip for two?) and large lobsters (3 pounds or more at market price).
The strip steaks and lobsters are top-notch, by the way, and the fried
onions and creamed spinach come highly recommended as well.

Pizzeria Paradiso
$$
Dupont Circle/Georgetown
PIZZA
Pizzeria Paradiso is so popular — because it’s so good — that the original
Dupont Circle spot spawned an offspring restaurant in Georgetown. Then
the Georgetown location expanded into its downstairs, creating a beer and
pizza parlor dubbed Birreria Paradiso. This is excellent pizza prepared in
the traditional Neapolitan manner. The light, thin crust is baked in a wood-
burning oven and topped with whatever you request. To taste real
Neapolitan pizza, order the Margherita, which comes with tomato, basil,
and mozzarella cheese. The Atomica is spicy, thanks to the hot pepper
flakes combined with the tomato, salami, black olives, and mozzarella.
Paradiso also serves sandwiches, salads, and desserts. And the Birreria
offers 80 bottled beers and 17 on tap. But it’s the pizza that sets Paradiso
apart from Washington’s other restaurants, with the exception of the sim-
ilar 2 Amys in Upper Northwest. It’s bustling and it serves pizza, so it’s
obviously a good place to take kids. It’s also a good spot when you’re look-
ing for takeout. The restaurants are small — especially the tiny Dupont
Circle original — and they don’t take reservations. So it’s wise to phone
ahead to check the likely waiting time for a table.

Poste
$$$$
Penn Quarter
MODERN AMERICAN
I’m happy to report that Poste found a chef (Robert Weland) who could
keep his job. That’s a big deal for this extremely good-looking restaurant
that seemed capable of enticing chefs into its kitchen but incapable of
developing a long-term relationship. When Weland arrived here in May
2004 (from Guastavino’s in New York), he became Poste’s third chef since
the restaurant’s opening in July 2002. Poste occupies one of the most strik-
ing and historical spaces in the D.C. dining world — the mail-sorting room
of the 1842 General Post Office which, after an 1859 expansion, housed the
Tariff Commission. Sixteen feet above the floor is the original cast iron ceil-
ing with skylights. Floor-to-ceiling cupboards, filled with cooking utensils,
cover one wall. Another is hung with large mirrors. The plush booths pro-
vide comfortable seating, and you have the choice of outdoor tables in
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 153

nice weather. The place can get noisy, and the trip to the bathroom
becomes an adventure; you have to walk through the lobby of the adja-
cent Hotel Monaco, then climb the stairs or take the elevator to the second
floor. As for the food, Weland prepares a seasonal menu, and he’s so into
freshness that he’s put a greenhouse on the terrace so he can take herbs
straight from the plant to the kitchen as he cooks. If it’s on the menu, try
the salmon poached in olive oil with horseradish and chives. If you like
rabbit, this is the place to get it — braised in red wine with poppy seed
egg noodles, caramelized fennel, and wild mushrooms. The Key lime tart
makes for a refreshing dessert. If you’re a crème brûlée aficionado, Poste’s
version is fabulous.

The Prime Rib
$$$$$
Downtown
STEAKHOUSE
If you want to visit the first half of the last century during your D.C. vaca-
tion, eat at Oceanaire one night and Prime Rib the next. At Prime Rib, the
1940s atmosphere comes from subdued lighting, black lacquered walls,
brass trim, leather chairs and booths, tuxedoed waiters, a piano and bass
playing supper club music after 7:30 p.m., and the requirement that gen-
tlemen wear jacket and tie. The food is impeccable — prime beef, of
course, but also a wide selection of seafood, plus a little lamb, pork, veal,
and chicken. This place is called the Prime Rib for a reason, so you ought
to have a good excuse for ordering something else. If you crave seafood,
order the crab cake for your appetizer.

Rasika

MODERN INDIAN
The food here is just plain wonderful. Executive Chef Vikram Sunderam —
who came to Washington from his native India via London’s Bombay
Brasserie — insists he does traditional Indian cooking, deviating only by
substituting fresh locally grown meats and produce for some traditional
Indian ingredients. But there’s clearly a creative touch in this chef’s hands.
The result — which the restaurant labels “modern Indian cuisine” — is
quite pleasing. You can order a multicourse meal, with appetizer, salad,
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C.

main course, and dessert. Or you and your dining companions can graze
among Rasika’s small-plate offerings. The palak chaat is a spectacular
salad of crispy, deep-fried baby spinach, served with sweet yogurt and
tamarind date chutney. The tandoori black cod is moist, tender, rich, and
truly melts in your mouth. For dessert, pick the apple jalebi, which a fellow
diner described as an Indian beignet. It’s a crispy battered and deep-fried
apple ring, topped with a sweet glaze and served warm with cardamom
ice cream. Rasika also offers a three-course pre-theater menu for $28, a
chef’s tasting menu for $50 ($70 with paired wines), and a vegetarian tast-
ing menu for $36 ($56 with the wines). Rasika’s décor is modern, light, and
airy, suggesting India with hanging silk panels and strings of glass beads.
Lots of hard surfaces means the dining room can become noisy. The large
windows along the front wall unfortunately look out on the loading docks
of buildings across D Street.

This is PC food for people with lots of organically grown greenbacks.
Everything possible on Nora’s menu is produced without chemicals, hor-

with an asterisk. Most likely, it’s wild fish or foraged mushrooms, for which
no certification exists. The water is triple-filtered to remove chlorine, bac-

eratives that grow their crops beneath the forest canopy to protect native
trees and wildlife. Even the staff’s shirts are made from organic yarn, and
Nora strives to patronize winemakers who don’t use chemicals in their
vineyards. Oh, and did I say the food is sophisticated and delicious and
that the dining room — decorated with antique quilts — is attractive and
comfortable?

Sea Catch

SEAFOOD
Hidden in the back end of a courtyard off 31st Street, between M Street

an attractive place to eat good food year-round. In warm weather, tables

on an outdoor terrace overlook the canal. When it’s cold, you still can view
the canal through floor-to-ceiling windows. Fireplaces in two of the dining
rooms make this restaurant a pleasant and romantic place to dine when it’s
really cold. I especially like the front dining room, which has stone walls,
windows facing onto the canal, wood paneling, ceiling beams, and one of
those fireplaces. To start your meal here, try the mixed green salad topped
with grapefruit, avocado, and crushed hazelnuts. You can’t beat the crab
cakes for your main course or appetizer. The lobster is quite good, too. If
you like your tuna rare, Sea Catch holds that out as a signature dish.
Susan’s word for the crème brûlée here is “wonderful.”

Sette Osteria
$$$
Dupont Circle
ITALIAN
Sette Osteria is a popular haunt in bustling Dupont Circle. By fairly early
in the evening, you’re likely to find young professionals three-deep at the
bar, standing, drinking, chatting, glancing at the large-screen TVs, and jug-
gling slices of superb pizza from the wood-fired oven. This is a modern,
airy, attractive restaurant that’s full of hard surfaces: bare tables, bare
walls, tile floors, and floor-to-ceiling windows onto R Street and
Connecticut Avenue. Combined with the lively bar scene, this makes for a
lot of noise — and, by the way, kid-friendliness — as a result. (On a recent
visit we saw children in high chairs and an infant being passed from lap to
lap around a table as the adults took turns eating.) Sette’s pizzas boast a
thin, chewy crust under excellent toppings. Sharing one is a great way to
start your meal. I really like the pizza ai funghi, which is topped with mush-
rooms, mozzarella, and tomato. Other good choices include the four-
cheese pizza and the salsiccia e cime di rapa, which is topped with
mozzarella, pork sausage, chili peppers, and broccoli rabe. For the main
course, I highly recommend the cavatelli pasta with mild Italian sausage,
broccoli rabe, and pecorino cheese. If you like gnocchi — many people
find this pasta too dense and pasty — Sette’s gnocchi alla Sorrentina is
served in a fine sauce of tomato, mozzarella, and basil.
Sette doesn’t take reservations. To avoid a wait, arrive by 6 or 6:30.

1789 Restaurant
$$$$$
Georgetown
AMERICAN
Washington gastronomes held their collective breath when Executive Chef
Ris Lacoste turned in her toque at this Georgetown institution. Could a
successor maintain 1789’s status as one of D.C.’s very best restaurants for
romance and special occasions? The answer, we now know, is “yes.” Since
commandeering the kitchen at the beginning of 2006, Nathan Beauchamp
has preserved the best of 1789 while steadily putting his own stamp on
the place. You’re still served by attentive, knowledgeable, tuxedoed wait-
ers in long white aprons and busboys in white jackets. Male guests are still
required to wear jackets, and everyone seems happy to dress up for the
formal dining rooms anyway. The first-floor room with a fireplace is still
the best spot to dine, especially if you’re sharing a special meal with a sig-
nificant other. When I first sampled Beauchamp’s fare — with my signifi-
cant other, by the way — Susan and I were blown away from the start by
the escargot in a crispy pastry shell with garlic-onion-mushroom purée.
The crab soup was a light broth with generous helpings of lump crabmeat,
corn, scallions, and other vegetables. The moist pork chop was accompa-
nied by tasty/sweet greens. The dessert pastries — mine lemon, Susan’s
peach — were equally appealing. Beauchamp offers a three-course, pre-
and post-theater menu for $35 and a five-course tasting menu for $65. The
restaurant, which takes its name from the birth year of the United States
government and Georgetown University, occupies a 19th-century Federal-
style house. It’s decorated with antiques and historical prints. It’s the
opposite of hip and attracts a lot of older diners. But younger folks come,
too, for the romantic setting — and superb food.

Tabard Inn

MODERN AMERICAN
This is one of my wife’s favorite Washington restaurants — for the setting
as much as for the food. It truly is an inn, with sleeping, eating, and drink-
ing facilities scattered among three adjoining town houses near Dupont
Circle. The dining rooms are comfortable and lively at meal times. You can
have a drink by the fireplace in the winter and dine in the garden when it’s
warm. Chef Pedro Matamoros worked at the Tabard under two previous,
well-regarded, chefs — David Craig and Andrew Saba. Though Matamoros
is a native of Nicaragua with a special interest in French and Italian cui-
sine, he is keeping alive the Tabard’s tradition of Modern American cook-
ing, with changing seasonal menus and an emphasis on fresh local
ingredients. The seafood dishes always have tended to be the best here.

The Tombs

Bill Clinton ate and drank in this basement pub, as has nearly every other
student who has wandered the halls of Georgetown University since 1962.
Faculty and townsfolk frequent the place, too. It is, on the one hand, a col-
lege tavern. But it’s an unusually good-looking and well-maintained one.
And the food is quite good, too, thanks to the Tombs’ relationship with the
fabulous 1789 Restaurant upstairs. The crab cakes are superb — sweet,
moist, and perfectly seasoned. The veggie burger is fat and juicy. The
french fries are sublime — tasty, salty, crisp on the outside, moist in the
middle. The waiters automatically refill your iced tea and soft drinks as
well as your coffee.

Tony Cheng couldn’t decide between fish and meat, so he put Tony

Restaurant is a bit of a misnomer, because you can order poultry, beef,
pork, and vegetarian dishes there as well. But the seafood is the specialty,
and it always pays to check what’s fresh, including what’s swimming in the
tank. Downstairs, you pick your own ingredients for two different meth-
ods of cooking. Choose meats and vegetables for the chefs to sear quickly
on the grill. Or pick vegetables, meats, and seafood that you cook yourself
in a pot of boiling stock at your table. You finish the meal by eating the fla-
vorful stock.

PIZZA
This is real Neapolitan pizza, particularly the “pizze d.o.c.” offerings, which
follow the recipes of the Italian government’s “denominazione di origine
controllata” regulations. The pizzas here have thin, chewy crusts. I like the
d.o.c. Margherita, named after Italy’s first queen and topped with tomato
sauce, cheese, and basil. A Margherita “extra” enhances the flavor with
whole, sweet, fresh cherry tomatoes. The d.o.c. versions are meatless, with
fewer toppings than many Americans like. You can design your own pie
from a list of two dozen toppings if you prefer. Be sure to sample the side
dishes, such as the polpettini al forno (meatballs), suppli a telefono
(breaded rice balls stuffed with cheese and fried), and deviled eggs with
pesto sauce. The pizzas aren’t big enough to make a shared meal, the way
you’re used to doing in a typical American pizzeria. But two can share a
pizza when you add a couple of the sides or a salad. The restaurant is
cheery, with shiny black-and-white tile and sunny paint on the walls. The
décor makes for noise, which is one reason it’s kid-friendly. Other reasons
include the food, the highchairs, and the cheerful staff. For big folk, there’s
a wine bar in one corner.

Vidalia

Maybe it’s because I like jazz clubs, but it’s never bothered me that Vidalia

of the stairs. So let me reassure you that at the bottom you find a cheerful
restaurant with good food. Vidalia brought modern Southern cooking to
Washington as Arkansan Bill Clinton was moving into the White House in
the early 1990s. Proprietor/chef Jeffrey Buben calls Vidalia’s cooking
“American cuisine with a subtle southern influence.” That means five-
onion soup for an appetizer, shrimp and grits for the main course, and
Georgia pecan pie with bourbon caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream,
and a crisp praline chocolate cookie for dessert, for example. When Buben
puts more emphasis on the modern, he comes up with dishes such as
Tasmanian sea trout wrapped in phyllo with herb butter, crisp pork belly,
honey cap mushrooms, beluga lentils, and pinot noir essence.

Zaytinya
$$
Penn Quarter
MEDITERRANEAN
The worst thing about Zaytinya is that you can make reservations only for
lunch and from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. when patrons can be assured of a table
before they head off to a nearby theater. This popular spot fills up rapidly
after that. So the best solution may be to arrive here around 6:30 and then
linger over several rounds of Mediterranean mezes (small plates) while
enjoying the view of the bustling street scene outside the floor-to-ceiling
windows. This strategy is especially good in spring or autumn, when you
can watch night fall outside and the dining room become warmed by soft
lighting inside. This stunningly attractive, modern restaurant is two sto-
ries high in the main dining room, with dark wood tables and chairs, white
walls, and tiers of candles that cast soft light from the wall opposite the
windows. Entrees are on the menu, but you should pass on them and let
your waiter help you select mezes to share. If you’re a vegetarian, you’ll
be pleased to note that 70 percent of these dishes were made for you. The
kolokithokeftedes (zucchini-cheese patties) are light and tasty, fried crisp
on the outside but creamy within. A nice alternative to the cooked mezes
comes from one of the two salads that are based on tomatoes, cucumbers,
red onions, and green peppers. Chef José Andrés is especially proud of the
manty nejla, little pastas stuffed with beef in a yogurt sauce. The prepara-
tion is so labor-intensive that it can’t turn a profit, he said, but it belongs
on the menu as a statement of the restaurant’s intentions.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Washington is full of workaholics who eat at their desks and tourists
who eat on the run, so the city is full of places where you can grab
snacks and light meals. Because Washington has so many parks — from
huge expanses like the National Mall to small green areas suitable for
alfresco dining scattered all around town — getting picnic food to go is a
great idea.
Quick and cheap
Because of office workers downtown, you’ll find an inexpensive lunch
spot on nearly ever corner and at many points mid-block. Elsewhere,
they’re not as common. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find a neighbor-
hood that doesn’t have a few modest eateries that are quick and cheap.
One of my favorites goes by the nonsense name Booeymonger (3265
Prospect St. NW at Potomac Street in Georgetown, % 202-333-4810; and
5252 Wisconsin Ave. NW at Jenifer Street near the D.C.-Maryland border
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
160

in Upper Northwest, % 202-686-5805). The Wisconsin Avenue deli is a
Price family hangout, because it’s just a few blocks from home, the eat-in
and takeout service is fast, and the food is good. (We’ve got Booeymonger
frequent-eater cards!) My wife has a thing for the Manhattan — roast beef,
spinach, bacon, cheddar cheese, and dressing on a baguette — and the
carrot cake. In delis, I tend to go for hot pastrami on rye with mustard.
When in a healthy mood, however, I order Booey’s Pita Pan, a veggie and
cheese sandwich. The menu has lots of sandwiches, salads, and sides to
choose from (some with silly names), and you can get a full breakfast in
the morning. The Georgetown Booey is open from 8 a.m. to midnight daily,
the Wisconsin Booey is open from 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.
Another place I like a lot is Chipotle (1837 M St. NW, % 202-466-4104;
3255 M St. NW, % 202-333-8377; 1629 Connecticut Ave. NW, % 202-387-

Ave., in the Friendship Heights shopping district, % 301-654-6661). I
know it’s a chain, but it’s much more attractive — and the food is much
better — than the typical fast-food joint. Burritos and tacos are made
fresh as you order them in the cafeteria line and instruct the cooks on
which ingredients you want. And you can grab a beer or margarita to
quench your thirst.
Coffee shops
Besides a zillion branches of a certain Seattle coffee empire,
Washingtonians have many sources for their caffeine fixes.
One of the most interesting is Kramerbooks & Afterwords Cafe (1517
Connecticut Ave. NW, just above Dupont Circle; % 202-387-1400).
Bookish coffee spillers have been gathering at the cafe inside this book-
store since long before the national chains discovered how to sell food
and drink with reading materials. You can get a caffeine or lit fix here
just about any time you need one, because this place is open Monday
through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., and ’round the clock from
7:30 a.m. Friday to 1 a.m. Monday.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 163

6:30 a.m. weekdays. Some close on weekends. Call the location you’re
interested in for specifics.
Breakfast spots
To check out the power breakfast scene, head for a hotel dining room
near the White House or Capitol. The Lafayette Room at the Hay-Adams
(1 Lafayette Sq. at 16th and H streets NW; % 202-638-6600) and the
Willard Room at the Willard InterContinental (1401 Pennsylvania Ave.
NW between 14th and 15th streets; % 202-628-9100) are good places to
start. So is the Old Ebbitt Grill (675 15th St. NW between F and G
streets; % 202-347-4800).
At Kramerbooks & Afterwords Cafe (1517 Connecticut Ave. NW, just
north of Dupont Circle; % 202-387-1400), you can crack a book with
your soft-boiled egg.
If you want to jump-start your engine, not the economy’s, try the Luna
Grill and Diner (1301 Connecticut Ave. NW at N Street; % 202-835-
2280). Another place for a fast, cheap — and good — breakfast is at
Booeymonger (3265 Prospect St. NW at Potomac Street in Georgetown,
% 202-333-4810; and 5252 Wisconsin Ave. NW at Jenifer Street in Upper
Northwest, % 202-686-5805).
Tea for two (or one)
The United States has come a long way since the Boston Tea Party.
Instead of throwing it into the harbor, Americans now drink it in great
quantities. In Washington, several hotels are doing their part to perpetu-
ate the upper-crust British tradition of high tea. In this context, high tea
is a light meal with small, trimmed sandwiches (no crusts!), little cakes,
and — of course — pots of fresh-brewed tea.
If you take high tea, you can pass on a big meal at dinnertime and opt for
a snack later in the evening.
Get fancy and refined at the Four Seasons Hotel (2800 Pennsylvania Ave.
NW at 28th Street; % 202-342-0444). Soak up the view of Rock Creek
Park from the Garden Terrace Lounge and nibble on finger sandwiches,
breads, tartlets, scones with Devonshire cream, fresh-brewed tea, and a
nip of sherry (for medicinal purposes only). Teatime is 2 to 5 p.m. daily.
Wednesday through Sunday, a pianist performs.
You can learn Chinese tea ritual at Ching Ching Cha (1063 Wisconsin
Ave. NW near the C&O Canal in Georgetown; % 202-333-8288). The set-
ting is serene and enhanced by classical Chinese music. The parlor lists
more than two dozen teas from China and Taiwan, plus meals, snacks,
and desserts. You also can purchase loose tea to take home. The restau-
rant is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C. 
164

Treating fine tea like fine wine, the Park Hyatt Washington (24th and M
streets NW; % 202 419 6755) has opened a “tea cellar” and offers rare
teas that can sell for several hundred dollars a pot. (Others go for con-
siderably less). Teas are available all day, tea with pastries daily 2:30 to
4:30 p.m.
You can tour and take tea at the Washington National Cathedral
(Massachusetts and Wisconsin avenues NW; % 202-537-8993) on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays, except for some holidays. The tour starts at
1:30 p.m. inside the West Entrance on Wisconsin and finishes high up in
the Pilgrim Observation Gallery, where you can gaze through arched
windows at the city and beyond. Cost is $22 per person. Reservations
are required — often far in advance — and are accepted up to six
months ahead of time.
Where to find picnic supplies
Visitors intent on cramming in a lot of sights often prefer quick bites to
spending an hour or two in a restaurant. Most delis and coffee shops —
as well as many full-service restaurants — gladly pack your order to go.
Don’t think of this to-go service as just fast food, however. Think of it as 
a picnic. You can find park benches all over the place, as well as many
small park areas. I particularly like Lafayette Square, across Pennsylvania
Avenue from the White House, and you can find lots of room on the Mall
and around the Tidal Basin. (I’ll pray for the pigeons and squirrels to
leave you alone. You can do your part by not feeding them.)
Dean & Deluca’s Georgetown shop (3276 M St. NW, east of 33rd Street;
% 202-342-2500) is a great place to put together a picnic. It offers a
wide selection of sandwiches, salads, and desserts, as well as gourmet
groceries. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can picnic in Dean &
Deluca’s outdoor cafe, take your food south of M to the C&O Canal
National Park, or go further south to the Georgetown waterfront.
Another option is to get food to go at the Smithsonian museums, then
take it outside to eat on the Mall.
You can find good, basic sandwich shops throughout the city — several
per block in many places. Among those that I can vouch for, should you
pass them in your wanderings, are Au Bon Pain, Booeymonger, Bread &
Chocolate, Chipotle, Corner Bakery, Firehook Bakery, La Madeleine,
Vie de France, and the Wall Street Deli — all with multiple locations.
Chocolates and sweets
Does your sweet tooth need a fix? Head for Bread & Chocolate (666
Pennsylvania Ave. SE, between 6th and 7th streets, on Capitol Hill, 
% 202-547-2875; 2301 M St. NW, in the West End, % 202-833-8360; or
5542 Connecticut Ave. NW, at Morrison Street, in Upper Northwest, 
% 202-966-7413). This bakery/restaurant makes marvelous pastries.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 165

Sample the strudels, tortes, and pies at Cafe Berlin (322 Massachusetts
Ave. NE, east of 3rd Street; % 202-543-7656), also located on the Hill.
Back in Upper Northwest, buy a cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory
(5345 Wisconsin Ave. NW, between Jenifer Street and Western Avenue;
% 202-364-0500). Choose among 35 varieties of calorie-laden, artery-
clogging cheesecakes — or a bunch of other sweets. (You may find a
slice too rich to consume in one sitting and want to share with your
companions. I can’t imagine why.) Kron Chocolatier (5300 Wisconsin
Ave. NW; % 202-966-4946) is across the street in the Mazza Gallerie.
This shop sells all manner of world-class chocolate. Try the chocolate-
dipped strawberries.
We all scream for ice cream
Washington’s gone kind of ice-cream crazy, with lots of shops, many of
them local, some of them unusual.
At the Cold Stone Creamery (3508 Connecticut Ave. NW, north of
Ordway Street in Upper Northwest; % 202-237-2605), you pick your ice
cream flavor and goodies to mix into it — candy bar chunks, for exam-
ple, or hot fudge sauce. The clerk scoops the ice cream onto a cold
stone (natch) and then mashes your additives into it.
For another unique treat, check out Dolcezza Argentine Gelato Cafe
(1560 Wisconsin Ave. NW, at Q Street in Georgetown; % 202-333-4646).
Here you get Argentinean ice cream, which is extra creamy and rich. For
traditional U.S. ice cream in Georgetown, head for Thomas Sweet (3214
P St. NW, east of Wisconsin Avenue; % 202-337-0616).
If the ice cream craving strikes you at Dupont Circle, walk on up to
Sweet Licks (1704 R St. NW, west of 17th Street; % 202-797-2736).
Gifford’s, a locally made ice cream presence in the D.C. area since 1938,
has shops in Penn Quarter (E and 10th streets NW; (% 202-347-7755)
and Friendship Heights (21 Wisconsin Circle, just north of the intersec-
tion of Wisconsin and Western avenues NW; % 301-652-8965).
On Capitol Hill, Ben & Jerry’s (% 202-842-2887) and Häagen-Dazs
(% 202-789-0953) both dish up their rich and creative flavors in 
Union Station. You’ll also run into Ben & Jerry’s at the Hill’s Eastern
Market (327 7th St. SE, between Pennsylvania Avenue and C Street; 
% 202-546-2253) and Downtown in the Old Post Office Pavilion (1100
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, at 11th Street; % 202-842-5882). Ben, Jerry,
Häagen, and Dazs pop up in several other spots around town, as well.
Food court extraordinaire
The lower level of Union Station houses the largest and most diverse
food court I’ve ever seen. Sure, you can buy hamburgers and pizzas, and
if that’s what the kids desire, that’s fine. Those with more cosmopolitan
Part III: Settling into Washington, D.C.

tastes will want to take a stroll around the entire court before making
their selections.
You can find the usual national chains, but also branches of local
restaurants and a wide range of cuisines — Indian, Greek, Chinese,
Cajun, Italian, barbecue, pizza, salads, pasta, sushi, deli items, baked
goods, and gourmet coffee among the vast selection of edibles. If that
doesn’t satisfy you, you can take the escalator up to the next level,
where other food establishments — from fast-food stands to full-serve
restaurants — are scattered among the train gates and boutiques.
Meals on the Mall
You’ll be spending lots of time in the museums along the National Mall —
and trudging from one to the other. You can ease your hunger and 
quench your thirst in many of them. Some three million people eat in the
Smithsonian Institution’s cafeterias and restaurants each year. The food
spots tend to be open when the museums are. All are happy to add to
your American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa bills.
The best place to eat on the Mall is the Mitsitam Café in the National
Museum of the American Indian. I’m not talking relative to the
mediocre offerings at most of the museums; I’m talking really good,
Native American–inspired food, including sandwiches, entrees, soups,
and desserts.
In addition to one of the world’s great collections of fine art, the National
Gallery of Art offers the next-best dining options on the Mall — the
Cascade Cafe in the concourse between the East and West buildings, and
the Pavilion Cafe, in the Sculpture Garden.
The Cascade Cafe with a view of a waterfall, is a large cafeteria with a
wide choice of food. The dining area is bright and airy, the walls hung
with prints from the gallery’s collection. For $7.15, you can get one of the
best dining deals in Washington — soup and half a big sandwich. I rec-
ommend the wild mushroom soup, which is spicy and rich. When I’m at
the nearby D.C. courts building on jury duty — which, in Washington,
comes every two years like clockwork — I often wander down here
during lunch break.
The Pavilion Cafe is a glass-enclosed shelter in the Sculpture Garden. We
stopped in one noon after a 7-inch snowfall, warmed ourselves with chili
and tomato-herb bread, and gazed at the serene winter view outside. They
hand out enormous salads here, and sandwiches so stuffed that a dining
companion complained of the tuna salad sandwich: “There’s too much
tuna.” In winter, you can sit inside and watch the ice skaters outside. In
warm weather, you can eat at outdoor tables. Friday evenings from late
May to mid-September, jazz groups perform here from 5 to 8:30 p.m.
Elsewhere in the gallery, you’ll find an espresso bar that also serves
gelato, panini, and sweets; the Terrace Café, overlooking the atrium,
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Washington, D.C. 167

which offers salads, sandwiches, and desserts; and the Garden Cafe,
which serves full meals à la carte or from a buffet. Susan likes the
Garden Cafe for the setting, but I find the selection too small and the
prices too large.
Here are your other options:
 National Air and Space Museum: The Mezza Café offers sand-
wiches, soups, and salads. The Wright Place Food Court is fran-
chise village, with McDonald’s, Donato’s Pizza, and Boston Market.
In nice weather, an outdoor kiosk sells snacks.
 National Museum of Natural History: At the Fossil Cafe, you can
eat sandwiches, salads, and desserts at tables that are natural his-
tory exhibits themselves. The self-service Atrium Café offers fast
foods. From 6 to 10 p.m. Fridays, you can eat, drink, and listen to
live music at the Smithsonian Jazz Café for a $10 cover charge
(kids 12 and younger free).
 The Castle: This cafe serves coffee, sandwiches, desserts, and
snacks.
 Hirshhorn Museum: There’s an outdoor cafe here from late spring
through summer.
Drinks, with a view
Enjoy a cocktail while drinking in a primo view at the Sky Terrace of the
Hotel Washington (515 15th St. NW, at Pennsylvania Avenue; % 202-638-
5900). Between May and October, this spot is a favorite for catching a sun-
downer. Keep it simple and stick to a cheese platter or a sandwich if you
eat here. While you ogle the landscape, see how many buildings you can
identify. You can almost peer into the East Wing of the White House.
For a view of the Potomac River — and of younger Washingtonians hus-
tling for companionship of the opposite sex — mosey on down to
Georgetown’s Washington Harbour complex (3000 K Street, at Thomas
Jefferson Street) on a warm evening. Grab a table at one of the outdoor
watering holes, sip a drink, nibble on some appetizers, and watch the
people strolling along the riverwalk, the boats sailing on the river, and
the planes flying into and out of National Airport.

Part IV
Exploring
Washington, D.C.

In this part . . . 
You’re here to see the sights, and this part points you to
the best. I start with the biggies — the Capitol, the
Washington Monument, and the like. I also cover places that
might be less familiar to you, such as the Phillips Collection
and the Textile Museum. In case you’re interested in buying
as well as looking, I introduce you to the best of Washington’s
shopping scene. I also give tips on things to do outside of
Washington, including some suggested itineraries — for the
government groupie, for example, or the family with kids. If
you don’t want to take responsibility for your entire D.C. visit,
I point you to some guided tours.

Chapter 11
Discovering Washington,
D.C.’s, Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Visiting Washington’s most interesting memorials and monuments
 Getting cultured at museums and galleries
 Seeing your tax dollars at work in government buildings
 Entertaining your little kids and teens
 Finding guides to take you on tours
You came to Washington to see the sights, and this chapter gives 
you the scoop on Washington’s premier attractions (memorials, gal-
leries, topless bars — just wanted to see if you were paying attention —
and so on).
The following reviews give you the lowdown on what you find at each
place, as well as the specifics on hours, admission fees (if any), and any
helpful tips for visiting an attraction.
One of the most pleasant things I reveal is that, in the capital of the land
of the free, most of the attractions are free.
The Top Attractions from A to Z
For more information on the architecture and historical background of
some of D.C.’s attractions, see Chapter 2.
American Art Museum
Penn Quarter
The most impressive art on display here may be the building itself, which
was erected between 1836 and 1867 and which the American Art Museum
now shares with the National Portrait Gallery. Walt Whitman described it as
“the noblest of Washington buildings.” Constructed to house the U.S. Patent
Office, it’s also been called a “temple to the industrial arts,” one of the finest
Greek Revival structures in the country, and simply “The Old Patent Office

Building.” The Smithsonian Institution, which runs both museums, shut the
place down in 2000 for what turned into a six-year renovation that cost sev-
eral hundred million dollars. The result is stunning — both in the restora-
tion of the marvelous structure and the creation of superb viewing space
for the objects on display. The project restored marble floors, exposed
hidden skylights, added 30,000 square feet of gallery space, and made it
easier for visitors to move about the building. The galleries are extremely
well-lighted, so it’s easier to appreciate the art than it is in many other
museums. A new glass-walled conservation center allows visitors to watch
conservators at work. The museum owns 41,000 pieces of American art,
beginning in the 17th century. The collection covers the gamut of what
American artists have produced, including works by such notables as
Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart, James McNeill Whistler, Robert
Rauschenberg, Peter Paul Rubens, and Grandma Moses — along with folk
art from many of America’s ethnic groups. One of the most eye-popping
pieces is a gigantic folk-art installation, covered with aluminum foil, titled
Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations’ Millennium General Assembly.
Don’t miss it.
You can eat in the museum, but you shouldn’t. The surrounding neigh-
borhood is full of great places to eat, from cheap to very, very expensive.

Arlington National Cemetery
Virginia
There’s something overwhelming about the tens of thousands of simple
grave markers that march in perfect formation across Arlington’s hills and
valleys. In their presence, it’s impossible not to be moved by the enormity
of the sacrifice of the military men and women who fought to preserve
America’s freedom and to enforce its sometimes-controversial foreign poli-
cies. More than 260,000 war dead and veterans (and their dependents) are
buried here.
Stop first at the visitor center, look around, pick up a map, and then take
the short walk to the memorial to the nearly two million women who have
served in the military since the American Revolution. Return to the visitor
center and buy a ticket for the Tourmobile. The sprawling cemetery is
hilly. Unless you’re in great shape and have lots of time, I don’t advise cov-
ering it entirely on foot. The Tourmobile stops at the major sights. You can
get off, explore the cemetery as long as you like, and then re-board to con-
tinue your tour. Before boarding for the first time, use the visitor center’s
restrooms — you won’t find more until you get to Arlington House, where
Robert E. Lee once lived with his wife, Mary Custis Lee, Martha
Washington’s great-granddaughter.
The first Tourmobile stop is at the grave of President John F. Kennedy,
where his widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also is buried, along with

their two infants who died before the president. The president’s brother,
Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated during his own presidential cam-
paign in 1968, is buried nearby. These gravesites have commanding views
of the capital city.
The next Tourmobile stop is at the Tomb of the Unknowns, where the
guard is changed every hour on the hour from October to March and every
half-hour April to September. It’s a somber ceremony.
When you get to Arlington House, also known as the Custis-Lee Mansion,
you can take a free self-guided tour between 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., except
December 25 and January 1. The Robert E. Lee Museum at the house
opens at 8:30 a.m. The grave of Pierre L’Enfant, who drew up the plans for
the capital at George Washington’s request, is nearby. He was moved here
from a pauper’s grave and now enjoys a breathtaking panorama of his 
masterwork.
After you return to the visitor center, you can take a ten-minute walk to
the Marine Corps Memorial, yet another moving scene that portrays the
immortal photograph of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima during
World War II.
Expect to spend two to three hours at these sights.
Remember that Arlington is a cemetery, so please conduct yourself — and
be sure that your children conduct themselves — accordingly. Burials
most likely will take place while you visit — two dozen occur many days.

The buck may stop in the White House, but it starts here, where printers
and engravers make money, postage stamps, Treasury bonds, and White
House invitations. No free samples! However, you can purchase a souvenir
(such as uncut or shredded currency) in the visitor center, and play with
interactive displays.
March through August, you must get free, timed tickets on the day you
tour, and people line up early. One person can get up to four tickets. The
ticket kiosk is on Raoul Wallenberg Place on the 15th Street side of the
building. The kiosk opens at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday, except Federal
holidays, and tickets usually are gone by 9 a.m. Evening tours are offered
May through August. Without tickets, you can skip the tour and enter the
visitor center through the tour entrance on the 14th Street side. Tickets
aren’t required for tours September through February. Figure on spending
an hour here (not including the wait to get in).

Security has been tightened substantially at government facilities since
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Bureau of Engraving and
Printing closes to the public when the Homeland Security Department
raises the terrorist threat level to code orange.
Your U.S. representative and senators can help you with tickets to gov-
ernment buildings, such as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Phone
them way ahead of time, tell them what you want to do, and ask what they
can do for you.

Capitol
Capitol Hill
As the home to Congress and the most common symbol of American
democracy, the Capitol belongs on every visitor’s must-see list. The famil-
iar architecture, the historic art inside, and the ornate decoration are other
aspects that make the Capitol an interesting stop. Unfortunately, con-
struction of a visitor center under the Capitol’s East Lawn — along with
various makeshift, post-9/11 security barriers — has turned much of the
area around the Capitol into an eyesore and obstacle course. But take
heart; the architect of the Capitol said he “expected” the center to be com-
pleted and opened by the time of your visit. (On the other hand, it was
supposed to be done during 2005!)
The Capitol dominates the Washington landscape. The 180-foot-high dome
is topped by a statue titled Freedom. Inside, the Rotunda serves as the
heart of the Capitol. Above the Rotunda, in the canopy of the dome, you
see Constantino Brumidi’s fresco, The Apotheosis of Washington, which
portrays the first president as a godlike character flanked by such alle-
gorical figures as Liberty, War, Victory, and Fame. Statues of prominent
Americans — and some not so prominent — fill Statuary Hall and stand
throughout the building. Most importantly, of course, the building con-
tains the House and Senate chambers, and the offices of top congressional
leaders and some of the most powerful committees.
You can obtain free tickets for guided tours from a member of Congress or
first-come, first-served at the Capitol Guide Service Kiosk along the curv-
ing sidewalk near First Street SW and Independence Avenue beginning at
9 a.m. Monday through Saturday. Lines can get quite long in spring and
summer — and tickets can run out — which is why contacting your rep-
resentative or senators ahead of time is a good idea. Expect to spend one
to two hours here, not counting the time you wait to get in.
Your U.S. representative and senators can arrange for you to join a special
Capitol Guide Service tour that’s conducted before the public tours. Some

members of Congress — and their aides — are happy to lead constituents
on tours themselves. Call your state’s representative or senators far ahead
of your visit and ask what they might do for you.
If the House or Senate is in session, you can watch the proceedings from
a visitor’s gallery. Call your representative or a senator for tickets.
If you do take a seat in a visitors gallery, don’t be surprised if nothing excit-
ing is going on. While the chambers fill for roll-call votes and during
extremely important debates, usually only a handful of members is on the
floor. You can witness the surreal scene of a grandiloquent senator pro-
pounding profoundly on the greatest issues of the day, with only one or
two other members, one or two reporters, a few congressional staffers —
and C-SPAN cameras — looking on.
See map p. 178. Capitol Guide Service Kiosk, near 1st Street SW and Independence
Avenue. % 202-225-6827. (Call senators at % 202-224-3121, representatives at 
% 202-225-3121.) www.aoc.gov. Metro: Capitol South. Walk north 1 block on 1st
Street SE, turn left on Independence Avenue for 3 blocks, and then go right on 1st
Street SW for 1 block. Admission: Free. Tours: 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Mon–Sat except
Thanksgiving and Dec 25. First-come, first-served tour tickets distributed at kiosk
beginning at 9 a.m.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial
Tidal Basin
This monument to a U.S. president illustrates the latest trend in monument
architecture. It is, shall I say, monumental in size — telling the 32nd presi-
dent’s biography as well as honoring him on a 71⁄2-acre site. Walking through
four open-air “rooms,” one for each of Roosevelt’s terms, you revisit the
Great Depression, World War II, and other notable aspects of his 12-year
presidency, the longest ever. The memorial features statues of his first lady,
Eleanor, an important public figure in her own right, and Roosevelt’s
beloved dog Fala. Note how Fala’s statue shines where visitors pet it.
You can see FDR’s wheelchair and other memorabilia in the information
center. Restrooms are located at each end of the memorial. Allow 30 min-
utes to an hour to visit.
See map p. 178. West Basin Drive SW at Ohio Drive. % 202-426-6841. www.
nps.gov/fdrm. Metro: Smithsonian. From the Independence Avenue exit, walk
west on Independence until you’re sure that you’ve gone too far and then turn left on
West Basin Drive; total walking time about 30 minutes. The Tourmobile stops here, or
you can take a taxi. Admission: Free. Open: Outdoor memorial always open; staffed
daily 8 a.m.–midnight except Dec 25.
Holocaust Memorial Museum
Tidal Basin
I have yet to meet a soul unmoved by a visit to this museum. Prepare to be
emotionally drained when you leave. The museum recommends that chil-
dren younger than 11 not visit the permanent collection, but they can view
other exhibits. Prepare older children for what they’ll see and hear.

Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 187

The museum remembers the six million Jews who were murdered and the
millions of others who were murdered or oppressed during the Holocaust.
Multimedia exhibitions document this obscene chapter of history. Upon
entering, each visitor picks up an identity card of a Holocaust victim,
which personalizes the museum experience.
The self-guided tour begins with the rise of Nazism. Then, the Nazis’ “Final
Solution” is depicted. Aboard a freight car that was used to transport Jews
to Treblinka, visitors listen to recordings of survivors. Another section is
dedicated to the liberation of the concentration camps and to the non-
Jews who, at great risk, hid Jews.
Time-specific tickets are required to view the permanent exhibits, which
occupy the bulk of most visitors’ time at the museum. They’re available
free beginning at 10 a.m. by the museum’s 14th Street entrance for same-
day visits, but usually are depleted quickly. One person can pick up ten
passes. People often line up early. You can get tickets ahead of time for
$1.75 from Tickets.com (% 800-400-9373; www.tickets.com).
Other exhibits don’t require tickets. Among them is “Daniel’s Story,” which
is appropriate for families even with young children. The museum recom-
mends that parents also take children younger than 11 to the orientation
film, the Wexner Learning Center, the Children’s Tile Wall, and the Hall of
Remembrance.
Most people spend two to three hours in the museum; many visitors spend
a lot more time.

Closed Yom Kippur and Christmas.
Jefferson Memorial
Tidal Basin
This memorial is my favorite, partly because Thomas Jefferson is my
favorite founding father and partly because the setting is marvelous. A 19-
foot statue of Jefferson stands atop a six-foot pedestal inside the memor-
ial’s columned rotunda, which is akin to Jefferson’s designs for his
Monticello home and the University of Virginia. Jefferson quotations are
carved into the memorial’s interior.
The memorial, located on the southeast bank of the Tidal Basin, com-
mands a spectacular view of the Washington Monument and the White
House to the north. The scene is gorgeous in the spring when the cherry
blossoms bloom, and awe-inspiring after dark with Jefferson’s statue
standing behind you and Washington’s other illuminated landmarks glow-
ing in the distance. A bookstore and restrooms are in the basement. Park
rangers deliver talks upon request. Count on spending 15 to 45 minutes
here depending on whether you listen to a ranger’s talk — more if you get
mesmerized by the view.

426-6841. www.nps.gov/thje. Metro: Smithsonian. From the Independence
Avenue exit, walk 2 blocks west on Independence and then left on Raoul Wallenberg
Place to the Tidal Basin path. It’s a 15- to 25-minute walk. A Tourmobile stop is at the
memorial, or you can take a taxi. Admission: Free. Open: Always; staffed daily 9:30
a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Korean War Veterans Memorial
National Mall
Before Vietnam, another undeclared war helped to drive a once-popular
president (Truman) from office, cost more than 50,000 American lives, and
left the nation in a mood more inclined to forget a conflict than to memo-
rialize it. Finally, on the 42nd anniversary of the armistice that ended the
fighting — but which has not yet officially sealed the peace — the Korean
War Veterans Memorial was dedicated on July 27, 1995, by the presidents
of the United States and South Korea, Bill Clinton and Kim Young Sam.
Statues depicting an infantry unit on patrol are the focal point of the
memorial. Park rangers give talks upon request. A bookstore, restrooms,
and concessions are at the site. Allocate at least 15 minutes for touring.
See map p. 183. French Drive SW and Independence Avenue, southeast of the Lincoln
Memorial. % 202-426-6841. www.nps.gov/kowa. Metro: Foggy Bottom–George

and then left on French Drive. Or walk from the Tourmobile’s Lincoln Memorial stop.
Or take a taxi. Admission: Free. Open: Always; staffed daily 9:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Library of Congress
Capitol Hill
The general public can’t borrow books at this library, the world’s largest,
but you can do research here (and I have). The collection — 130 million
items on 530 miles of bookshelves — is built upon Thomas Jefferson’s per-
sonal library of 6,487 volumes.
The main building, named for Jefferson, is an ornate Italian Renaissance
structure that you can tour. If you saw the movie All the President’s Men,
you’ll remember a mind-boggling overhead shot of Woodward and
Bernstein doing research in the Main Reading Room, which you can view.
Another highlight, the Great Hall, soars 75 feet from marble floor to stained
glass ceiling. The Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz are among
artifacts on permanent display. The building also houses changing
exhibits, as well as film showings and concerts.
Stop first at the Jefferson Building’s visitor center, inside the ground level
1st Street SE entrance. Get tour tickets and ask what’s going on, not only
in the Jefferson Building, but in the library’s nearby Madison and Adams
buildings as well. Figure on spending one to two hours here if you take the
tour. Naturally, at Congress’s library, a representative or senator can get
you into a special tour.

Lincoln Memorial
National Mall
Okay, I confess: The Lincoln Memorial is up there with the Jefferson. If you
were forced to pick the greatest president, Lincoln would be in the final
four. And, like Jefferson’s, Lincoln’s memorial is an awe-inspiring place.
Once again, you have an oversized sculpture of the president inside a
structure that, in this case, has become as familiar as the Capitol and the
White House. (It’s on the back of the penny!) The Gettysburg Address and
Lincoln’s second inaugural address are inscribed on the walls. And the
vista is spectacular, looking the length of the Mall, past the World War II
Memorial and the Washington Monument to the Capitol.
The Lincoln Memorial has been the sight of some of America’s most impor-
tant political demonstrations, from Marian Anderson singing here in 1939,
to Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963, to the Vietnam
War protests. The Memorial has a visitor center and restrooms, and rangers
give talks on request. You can spend 15 to 45 minutes — or more — here,
depending on your interest, and it’s awe-inspiring at night. From the back,
you look into Arlington National Cemetery and see the perpetual flame on
Kennedy’s grave.
See map p. 183. West end of the Mall at 23rd Street between Constitution and
Independence avenues. % 202-426-6841. www.nps.gov/linc. Metro: Foggy
Bottom. Walk south 8 blocks on 23rd Street. Tourmobile stops here, or you can take
a taxi. Admission: Free. Open: Always; staffed daily 9:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
National Air and Space Museum
National Mall
This museum is crammed with significant artifacts of flight and exhibits
that teach the history and science of flight. You can stand beside John
Glenn’s Friendship 7 capsule, in which he became the first American to
orbit Earth, while gazing upon Neil Armstrong’s Columbia command
module, which first carried men to the moon. You can see Charles
Lindbergh’s ocean-crossing Spirit of St. Louis, Chuck (The Right Stuff)
Yeager’s sound-barrier-breaking X-1, a space station, a space rock . . . I have
no room to do the collection justice.
Orville and Wilbur Wright’s Flyer used to hang from the ceiling in the
Milestones of Flight Gallery, near Glenn’s and Armstrong’s capsules.
There, in a few feet of museum space, the 20th century progressed from
“man cannot fly” to “man can walk on the moon” — in just 65 years by four
guys who lived within 160 miles of each other in Ohio! Having covered
Glenn the senator — and worked for newspapers in the Wright brothers’
Dayton that circulated up to Armstrong’s Wapakoneta — I always found
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
190

that spot particularly meaningful. To mark the centennial of the Wrights’
first flight — December 17, 1903 — the museum moved the Flyer to a spe-
cial exhibit about “The Wright Brothers & the Invention of the Aerial Age.”
It’s been extended for an indefinite run.
Because the Air and Space Museum is on every visitor’s agenda, arriving
when the doors open or late in the day is wise. Get a map at the informa-
tion desk and decide whether you want to take a free guided tour, rent an
audio tape tour, or fend for yourself. Next, purchase tickets for one of the
movies on the multistory IMAX screen and consider buying tickets for the
Albert Einstein Planetarium’s tour of the universe.
An hour can slip by in what seems like seconds in this enormous, exhibit-
packed place. Kids love it here. Allow at least two to three hours. If you’re
with me or my nephew Jason the pilot, you’ll be here all day!

National Archives
Downtown
The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States,
the Bill of Rights, a 1297 version of the Magna Carta, and numerous other
historical documents reside in the Archives, which has become much
more visitor friendly because of a spectacular renovation. Those familiar
with the old Archives, where you squinted to glimpse documentary treas-
ures behind thick glass, will be especially pleased with the new Archives,
where history is explained with multimedia presentations, interactive
exhibits, and other state-of-the-art technologies. In the Charters of
Freedom hall, for instance, visitors for the first time can see all four pages
of the Constitution. The displayed documents have been made more easily
seen by children and people in wheelchairs. Multimedia exhibits display
documents and make their historical importance easier to understand.
“Documents” today include photographs, films, and television recordings.
Watch Harry Truman deliver the first televised presidential address —
about a 1947 international food crisis. At the Archives gift shop, you can
buy copies of documents as well as books, CDs, and games based on the
institution’s collections. Beyond being a tourist attraction, the Archives is
the nation’s record-keeper (official name: National Archives and Records
Administration). Anyone can conduct research within the billions of doc-
uments the Archives preserves.
Figure on spending at least a half hour viewing the main exhibits. Be
warned: If history interests you, this place could capture your attention
for hours or days.
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 191

If you can plan six weeks in advance, the Archives recommends that you
make a reservation by sending an e-mail to visitorservices@nara.gov.
Waits of an hour or more may be encountered during March, April, May,
Thanksgiving weekend, and the week between Christmas and New Year’s.
To join a guided tour, you must reserve by phoning % 202-357-5450.

Day weekend through Labor Day; to 5:30 p.m. daily after Labor Day through Mar; to
7 p.m. Apr through Memorial Day weekend. Closed Dec 25.
National Gallery of Art
National Mall
The National Gallery is two buildings — East and West — connected by an
underground walkway. The Gallery owns more than 100,000 works from
the Middle Ages to the present. Important works are on exhibit through-
out both buildings, and the gallery always is mounting special exhibitions,
some of international importance.
The West Building is a treasure chest of European art from the 13th into
the early 20th centuries and American art from the 18th to the early 20th.
It includes the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Western
Hemisphere.
I.M. Pei designed the starkly modern East Building, which, appropriately,
houses the gallery’s 20th-century and contemporary art. An immense
Calder mobile dominates the soaring central court. You also see works by
Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, and Jackson Pollock here.
In the Micro Gallery, near the Mall entrance to the West Building, you can
use a computer terminal to identify the works you want to see and then
print a map that shows you where they’re located. In addition to the
exhibits, the Gallery presents daily tours of the collection, a concert series,
lectures, and films. The shops sell some of Washington’s best souvenirs —
reproductions of the gallery’s masterworks in many forms. The Gallery
even has a children’s shop. You need at least two hours for a cursory taste
of the National Gallery’s treasures.
Families take note: Kids — as well as adults — enjoy the outdoor Sculpture
Garden, across 7th Street from the West Building. It even has an ice-skat-
ing rink in the winter.
In addition to housing sculpture, the garden hosts live jazz performances
5 to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays from late May to mid-September.

National Museum of American History
National Mall
If the Smithsonian is the nation’s attic — as it’s often called — then this
museum is the corner where the heirlooms are kept: three million pieces
of vintage Americana.
A highlight here always has been the original Star-Spangled Banner, the
giant flag that inspired the national anthem during the battle for Fort
McHenry in Baltimore in 1814. You also can take a look at first ladies’
gowns, a Samuel Morse telegraph, an Alexander Graham Bell telephone,
George Washington’s military uniform, Abraham Lincoln’s top hat,
Muhammad Ali’s boxing gloves, Duke Ellington’s sheet music, Julia Child’s
kitchen . . . even Howdy Doody. And that’s not even scratching the surface.
Exhibition halls let you concentrate on things (agriculture equipment,
power machinery, musical instruments), while others explore social phe-
nomena (First Ladies’ roles in politics, Americans at war, sports in
American life).
The hands-on history and science rooms are designed for youngsters (or
oldsters) five and older. Kids conduct experiments in the science room. In
the history room, they can climb on a high-wheel bicycle or transmit a
telegram. When the rooms are busy, you’re given timed tickets that let you
in later in the day.
You need at least two hours here, and this museum is another one in which
you could spend an entire day and then come back for more.
The National Museum of American History closed for renovations in 2006
and was scheduled to re-open in summer 2008. In the interim, some of the
museum’s holdings were to be displayed in other Smithsonian facilities.
See map p. 178. Between Constitution Avenue NW, Madison Drive, and 12th and 
14th streets. % 202-633-1000. http://americanhistory.si.edu. Metro:
Smithsonian. From the Mall exit, walk north across the Mall to the museum on your
left. Admission: Free. Closed until summer 2008. Likely hours when reopened: Daily
10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed Dec 25.
National Museum of the American Indian
National Mall
The Smithsonian’s newest museum has caused quite a stir. Not only has it
proved to be enormously popular, it’s also been quite controversial.
Leaders of Indian organizations were intimately involved in the planning of
the museum (including choosing the name), and critics complain that it’s
too heavy on Native American myths and too light on hard science.
You can decide for yourself by perusing the contents of the 250,000-square-
foot facility which opened in fall 2004. The museum has acquired 10,000
years worth of artifacts from all the Americas — far more than can be dis-
played at one time. You also can shop at two museum stores and eat in the
Mitsitam Café. (“Mitsitam” means “let’s eat!” in the Delaware and Piscataway
Indian language.) The cafe — the best place to eat on the Mall — serves
Native foods from throughout the Western Hemisphere.
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 193

The museum’s exterior architecture is designed to evoke a stone mass
carved over time by wind and water.

nmai.si.edu. Metro: L’Enfant Plaza. From the 7th Street/Maryland Avenue/
Smithsonian Museums exit, walk 2 blocks northeast on Maryland, then right on
Independence and left on 4th. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed
Dec 25.
National Museum of Natural History
National Mall
Kids dig dinosaurs, right? And bugs. And giant 3D movies. So they gotta love
this place! From the moment you walk in and encounter the huge African
elephant in the Rotunda, your children will be squealing with delight. And
the museum has plenty to interest the bigger folks, too. While the National
Gallery may boast that it has artworks stretching back 800 years, artifacts
at the Natural History Museum measure their years in billions.
When you’re done ogling the elephant, pick up a museum map at the
nearby information desk. Then consider buying tickets for the 90-foot-high
IMAX Theatre. If you’d like to join a tour, they leave from the elephant
exhibit in the Rotunda Tuesday through Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
Children go gaga at the insect zoo, where they can touch creepy crawly
critters and slither through a model of a termite mound, and they love to
explore Dinosaur Hall. Other highlights, for visitors of all ages, include the
Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals — where you find a moon rock, the
45.5 carat Hope Diamond, and many other baubles — and the exhibit on
Ice Age mammals, which includes a giant ground sloth, a saber-toothed
cat, and an American mastodon.
Humans are part of natural history, too, so the museum contains exhibits
about evolution and various human cultures. One may argue that a high
mark in human evolution was the development of jazz, and every Friday
from 6 to 10 p.m. the museum presents live music with food, drinks, and
IMAX films for a $10 cover (children 12 and younger free).
Plan on spending two to four hours here (not counting jazz night).

National Portrait Gallery
Penn Quarter
This gallery really is more about history than about art. Congress estab-
lished it to collect portraits of folks who have made “significant contribu-
tions to the history, development, and culture of the people of the United
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
194

States.” Because of the renovated facility (see American Art Museum
review for details), the well-informed displays, and the eclectic nature of
the collection, it’s fun to learn history through portraits. All the presidents
are here, of course, and many other powerful political leaders. But there
also are significant contributors from other aspects of American life —
Calvin Klein, for example, and Mia Hamm, Toni Morrison, Pocahontas,
Frederick Douglass, Chief Joseph, Lucille Ball, Janis Joplin, Miles Davis,
Jackie Robinson, Roberto Clemente, Susan B. Anthony, Cesar Chavez, Rosa
Parks . . . and Shari Lewis with Lamb Chop. The portraits come in many
media, not just oil on canvas. My favorite is a sculpture by cartoonist Pat
Oliphant of President George H.W. Bush, appearing possibly naked, lean-
ing forward to pitch a horseshoe. Think the Russian Portrait Gallery could
portray Vladimir Putin that way? Is this a great country, or what?

National Zoo
Upper Northwest
Hands-down the most kid-friendly place in town, the National Zoological
Park (that’s “zoo” to you) shows off 2,000 critters big and small around 163
acres of hills and valleys, with most of the animals in compounds designed
to resemble their natural habitat. Be sure to wear your walking shoes and
comfortable clothing, ’cause you’ll be doing lots of hiking here. The best
time to see animal activity is early morning or around dusk; midday, many
animals are napping and/or hiding away from zoo-goers.
Grab a map and schedule of events at the Education Building near the
Connecticut Avenue entrance. Zookeepers conduct demonstrations and
give talks throughout the park. It’s always fun to be around at feeding time
and when the elephants and seals put on performances.
Giant pandas have been the top attraction here since Richard Nixon was
president and China sent a pair to mark the improvement in the two
nations’ relationship. It wasn’t until mid 2005, however, that the current
adult pandas — Mei Xiang and Tian Tian — finally produced an offspring
who survived. Little Tai Shan immediately became the zoo’s First Animal,
and he has been a cutie to watch. Unfortunately, China gets to claim him
sometime during 2007, so consider yourself truly fortunate if you get here
in time to check him out. Otherwise, wish for his parents to get lucky again
and provide us with another kid to observe.
The giant pandas’ habitat is part of the zoo’s newest improvement, the
Asia Trail. Walk it and check out the new digs for sloth bears, red pandas,
small-clawed otters, fishing cats, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant
salamanders. Next planned for the trail: a better crib for the elephants,
who currently share their 1930s-era Elephant House with a giraffe, three
hippos, and two capybaras, which are gigantic rodents.
Hungry for other zoo highlights?

Remember that bar scene from Star Wars? Step into the other-worldly
Invertebrates House, and you’ll imagine that’s where you’ve landed.
Occupants range from octopuses and lobsters to cockroaches and ants.
The spiny lobster especially looks like he could be running that bar, or
ordering up some ethereal drink there.
At the Think Tank, you can look in as scientists study animal thinking,
including inquiring into orangutans’ language. Researchers test apes’ abil-
ity to use and understand word symbols. Outdoors and 50 feet overhead,
the apes use the Orangutan Transportation System to commute between
the Think Tank and the Great Apes House. I’ve never seen them swinging
there, but Julie’s caught them perched on the towers the line is connected
to as it runs above zoo walkways. Zoo officials assure that the apes are too
good at swinging to fall and too smart to jump all that way to the ground.
They may relieve themselves while up there, however, so don’t stand
beneath one.
The Amazon River Basin’s tropical habitat is re-created in Amazonia to
accommodate macaws, sloths, monkeys, avocadoes, cocoa trees, pira-
nhas, poison frogs, and others. It’s a great place to warm up in the winter.
There are lizards and turtles and snakes, oh my, at the Reptile Discovery
Center. Yucky for grownups, groovy for kids. More serene is the
Pollinarium, where hummingbirds and butterflies flit about, pollinating
plants.
Take your children to the Kids Farm, and they can pet or groom cattle,
donkeys, and goats, check out chickens and ducks, and play with interac-
tive educational displays. At the Pizza Garden, they can play on an over-
sized pie while learning about pizza ingredients, where they come from,
and how they’re grown. Tomatoes, basil, peppers, wheat, and other ingre-
dients are grown here. For the parents, there are benches. Kids three to
eight can crawl through Prairie Playland — which mimics the nearby
prairie dog village — popping their heads up through openings and look-
ing around just like the prairie dogs do.
The zoo is a large park with many walking paths and grassy areas where
you can sit and picnic. Locals run and hike through here. D.C. organiza-
tions hold group picnics here. One zoo neighbor was such an avid zoo
walker that his funeral was held here.
It’s easy to spend the entire day here, and then want to come back for
more. Take it easy. Flop for a while under a tree. Bring some food or grab
lunch or a snack at one of the — let’s call them “adequate” — refreshment
stands.
If you eat at the Maine Cafe, go all the way to the back of the dining room
and you’ll find tables at windows that overlook nearby zoo facilities.
Despite its name, Woodley Park-Zoo is not the best Metrorail station to use
on the way to the zoo. Here’s what the locals do: On the way to the zoo, use
the Cleveland Park station and then walk south on Connecticut Avenue
from the East Side exit. When leaving the zoo, walk south on Connecticut
to the Woodley Park-Zoo station. You walk a tad further, but more down-
hill and less uphill. The L1, L2, and L4 Metrobuses run from Dupont Circle
all the way up Connecticut Avenue to Maryland, stopping at the zoo. The

zoo provides parking, but charges $4 for the first hour, $12 for up to three
hours, and $16 for more than three hours.

Supreme Court
Capitol Hill
The majestic Supreme Court building looks as if it has been standing since
the birth of the republic — the Roman Republic. In fact, the court was the
last of the three government branches to get its own digs. The nine jus-
tices didn’t move into this classic temple until 1935. Previously, they occu-
pied a nook in the Capitol. This place is another one where a member of
Congress — with lots of notice — can get you into a guided tour. Other-
wise, you can wander around yourself, check out the exhibits on the
ground floor, and attend a lecture in the courtroom.
By far, the best thing to do here is attend a one-hour argument. The topic
can be front-page news around the world — defining freedom of speech,
setting limits on the death penalty — or it can pick at arcane details of a
commercial contract. No matter, it can be grand entertainment — with jus-
tices interrupting the lawyers, casting wry asides, or causing the court-
room to convulse in laughter with an on-the-money wisecrack. The court’s
right wing is most notable in the comment department. Antonin Scalia is
the most humorous — or scathing, depending on the moment — justice.
Clarence Thomas almost never opens his mouth.
The court hears arguments between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (sometimes only
in the morning) on many Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from
October into late spring, usually two weeks on and two weeks off. Lines
form on the plaza when arguments are being heard — one for listening to
an entire argument, the other for taking a three-minute peek. Come early
if the argument is big news. You can spend an hour here, more if you attend
an argument or take a tour.
See map p. 178. 1 1st St. NE (at Maryland Avenue). % 202-479-3211. www.supreme
courtus.gov. Metro: Capitol South. Walk north 21⁄2 blocks on 1st Street. Admission:
Free. Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Lectures, when courtroom not in use, every
hour on the half-hour 9:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m. Closed Federal holidays.
Vietnam Veterans Memorial
National Mall
Depending on your age and your circumstances, this memorial can be the
most emotional spot in Washington. The war divided the country, and the
surviving soldiers came home feeling unappreciated. The private Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Fund lobbied for a memorial on the Mall and raised
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 197

money to build it. The organizers wanted to honor the soldiers and steer
clear of the war’s politics. Maya Lin — a Chinese-American Yale University
student who grew up in Ohio — created the winning design.
Like the war, the simple memorial — a black granite V carved into the
ground — was controversial. To appease those who wanted a more tradi-
tional patriotic monument, a flagpole and a statue of three soldiers was
placed near the wall. Later a statue of three female military nurses, tend-
ing to a wounded soldier, was added.
Nevertheless, it’s the Wall — with its 58,250 names of the dead and 
missing — that commands the attention of visitors and eloquently com-
memorates the soldiers’ sacrifice. Park rangers are available to discuss
the memorial and help if you’re looking for individual names. So, usually,
are Vietnam-era vets. You can find a bookstore, restrooms, and conces-
sions in the area. You can spend as little as 15 minutes here, more as you’re
moved.

Memorial. % 202-426-6841. www.nps.gov/vive. Metro: Foggy Bottom. Walk

Admission: Free. Open: Always; staffed daily 9:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Washington Monument
National Mall
This towering marble obelisk is one of the most recognizable sights in
America. The view from the top is the most spectacular in Washington. You
can get free time-specific tickets for riding the elevator to the top on the day
of your visit at the monument’s ticket kiosk near 15th Street and Madison
Drive beginning at 8 a.m. One person may get up to six tickets. Tickets dis-
appear quickly in spring and summer, and the line sometimes starts form-
ing by 7:30 a.m., so arrive early. You can buy tickets in advance by calling 
% 800-967-2283 or on the Internet at http://reservations.nps.gov.
The charge is $1.50 per ticket, plus 50¢ per order.
The ride to the top takes just 70 seconds. You can stare out the windows
as long as you like. You descend at a slower speed so that you can view the
monument’s interior. The grounds contain exhibits, a bookstore, rest-
rooms, and concessions. On summer evenings, military bands perform
here, and the monument provides a gleaming exclamation point for the
Fourth of July fireworks.
You pass through security screening to enter the monument. Food, drinks,
and large bags are prohibited. If you wear a pacemaker or other medical
device that a magnetometer may affect, tell a ranger so that you can go
through alternative screening. Figure on a 30-minute visit, not counting
time in line.

White House
Downtown
Is it just me, or does everybody wonder why, if security can screen pas-
sengers to get on airplanes, they can’t screen visitors for White House
tours? As I write this book, things are looser than during the first couple
years after 9/11. But you still can’t just walk up to the White House gate
and get into a tour line. You must form a group of at least ten people and
make a reservation — up to six months ahead — through a senator or rep-
resentative. Check by Internet or phone to see whether things improve for
your visit.
If you do get in, you’ll see just a fraction of the president’s mansion, which
is not only the president’s home and office but also work space for the
highest ranking presidential aides and (usually) the White House press
corps. (The press room is being remodeled as I write, and the press has
been chased across the street to temporary digs.) The best time to visit is
when the place is decorated wonderfully for Christmas.
If you can’t get in, you’ll have to content yourself with strolling the perime-
ter of the grounds, gazing through the fence, and marveling at the bizarre
architecture of the Old Executive Office Building next door. You also can
visit the White House Visitor Center, which, strangely enough, is located
in the Great Hall of the Commerce Department building, on Pennsylvania
Avenue between 14th and 15th streets. There, you find ranger talks,
exhibits, a gift shop, and restrooms.

World War II Memorial
National Mall
Like the Mall’s newest museum (the National Museum of the American
Indian), the newest memorial arrived awash in controversy. First was the
controversy over why it took so long to erect this memorial to the troops
who fought America’s biggest war — even after memorials to the later
Korean and Vietnam conflicts were dedicated. It was opened finally on
April 29, 2004, and was dedicated on May 29, two days before Memorial
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 199

Day. Second was the controversy over the location, smack dab in the
middle of the Mall between the long-standing Lincoln Memorial and
Washington Monument. Critics objected that it would disrupt the hal-
lowed view from Lincoln’s seat to the Capitol dome, which had been inter-
rupted only by Washington’s thin obelisk. Finally was the controversy over
the design. After Maya Lin’s spare plan for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
had been emulated in later memorials all around the country, the World
War II Memorial came in big and bulky and ornate.
It’s my personal judgment that the memorial does not damage the view.
You can see it from Lincoln’s steps, but you’ve always been able to see
Washington’s obelisk, too. I do agree with the critics that the memorial is
way overdone. The giant plaza bakes in the summer (come in spring or
fall). The memorial is too big, with too many elements — pillars, wreaths,
arches, fountains, pools, stars, eagles, quotations, bas reliefs. The most
telling critique I’ve heard focuses on symbolism, which is what memorials
are about: There’s a tall pillar with a wreath for each state and territory
that fought in the war, which emphasizes separatism when in fact the
country was never more unified.
The beauty of America, of course, is that each visitor can decide for him-
self. You can check Lincoln’s view. You can study the new memorial up
close. As with the Vietnam Memorial, the time you choose to spend here
depends to a great extent on your personal relationship with this war. Plan
on at least 15 to 30 minutes.
There are restrooms, water fountains, and an information kiosk near the
memorial.
See map p. 183. 17th Street NW, between Constitution and Independence avenues.
% 202-619-7222. www.nps.gov/nwwm. Metro: Smithsonian. From the Independence
Avenue exit, walk west to 17th, then turn right. Admission: Free. Open: Always; staffed
daily 9:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
As a world capital — arguably the world’s capital — Washington really
does have something to interest everyone, or at least nearly everyone. In
this section, I identify places of particular appeal to kids, historians, art
aficionados, gardeners, and architecture buffs.
Especially for kids
If you have children with you, you should make a point to check out the
following sights, perfectly suited for young visitors. Washington is both a
fun and important destination for the younger members of the family,
with most of the national monuments and museums having a child-
focused aspect. Children love several of Washington’s top sights. In the
preceding section, be sure to check out the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of
American History, the National Museum of Natural History, and, of
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
200

course, the National Zoo. Here are some more spots that are particu-
larly attractive to kids — and, luckily, to their parents as well.
National Aquarium
Downtown
Kids can find relief from the heavy-duty sightseeing by ducking into this
little hideaway in the Commerce Department building. Youngsters can
watch sharks and other water creatures get along swimmingly. (It’s lucky
for the rest of the fish that a separate tank holds the piranhas.) Although
this aquarium doesn’t boast the latest in technological advances, it dis-
plays some 1,000 specimens of marine life (including alligators) in 80
exhibits. Kids can dip their hands into the touch tank and pet a horseshoe
crab. Feeding time is 2 p.m. daily, different carnivores on different days. A
visit here sets you back 45 minutes or more.
See map p. 202. 14th Street NW between Constitution and Pennsylvania avenues, in
the Commerce Department building. % 202-482-2825. www.nationalaquarium.
com. Metro: Federal Triangle. Walk half block north on 12th Street, left on
Pennsylvania 2 blocks, and then left on 14th. Admission: $5, seniors and military per-
sonnel $4, children two–ten $2, younger than two free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; last
admission 4:30 p.m. Closed Thanksgiving, Dec 25.
National Geographic Society’s Explorers Hall
Downtown
The National Geographic Society explores the universe, so you can
encounter exhibits on just about anything in Explorers Hall. Kids can be
enthralled by some of the changing topics. As I’m writing this book, for
example, featured exhibits include “Bizarre beasts: past and present” and
photos by the 2006 wildlife photographer of the year. Call or check the
Web site to find out what’s going on before you decide to attend. While
you’re here, you also can check out the National Geographic Store’s stock
of nature books, photography, globes, maps, and back issues of the mag-
azine. Plan on spending at least an hour.
See map p. 202. 17th and M streets NW. % 202-857-7588. www.national
geographic.com/explorer. Metro: Farragut North. From the L Street exit, walk
east on L 1 block and then go left at 17th. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec 25.
National Postal Museum
Capitol Hill
This museum, dedicated to the history of stamps and the postal service,
delivers, by extension, a large slice of American history. Interactive
exhibits make it a hit with children. Tour a Southern Railway mail car, look
up at mail planes, and discover the real story of the Pony Express. The
museum is located in the old City Post Office Building, which operated
from 1914 through 1986. There’s a museum store and a functioning post
office on site. Upstairs, part of the old post office has been transformed

into a Capitol City Brewing Company pub, one of those places that caters

Especially for teens
I have it on good authority, from teenagers who wish to remain anony-
mous, that the zoo is a cool place for teens to hang out. So is the Air and
Space Museum (see “The Top Attractions from A to Z,” at the beginning
of this chapter, for both listings). Here are some other places where local
teenagers like to go, and that visiting teens likely would enjoy as well.
International Spy Museum
Downtown
The interactive exhibits and gee-whiz spyware and spy lore grab young
folks’ attention and that of many older visitors as well. This museum has
been very popular, so you’re advised to purchase your time-specific tick-
ets in advance. That’s right, I said “purchase.” This spot is a privately oper-
ated enterprise and one of the few museums in town where you have to
pay to enter. That drops it way down the priority list when you’re decid-
ing how to spend your time in Washington. The crowds also can make it
difficult to get to some of the interactive exhibits.
Because of the subject matter here — violence, deception, terrorism —
the museum recommends that visitors be at least 12 years old, even
though discounted tickets are available for children ages 3 to 11.
Once inside, you encounter the latest in interactive museum technology,
along with old and new spy tools. You can see a Revolutionary War letter
written by George Washington to authorize establishment of a spy network
in New York in 1777. You can enter a mockup of an intelligence agency’s
21st-century operations center, which displays information about the latest
developments in espionage. Among the 68,000-square-foot museum’s many
artifacts are an Enigma cipher machine from World War II Germany, a U.S.
Army M-209 cipher machine from the same era, a Soviet overcoat with a
buttonhole camera, a CIA disguise kit, and (shades of Maxwell Smart!) a
shoe with microphone and radio transmitter concealed in the heel.
Instruments of violence, as well as of intelligence-gathering, are on display.
A U.S.-made bomb was disguised as a lump of coal to be planted in enemy
coal bins during World War II; it exploded when shoveled into a locomo-
tive’s engine, a ship’s boiler, or a factory’s furnace. A double-barreled
poison-gas gun enabled KGB agents to kill silently with a spray of cyanide.
Another KGB weapon — a single-shot pistol — was disguised as a lipstick
tube. On a lighter note, some exhibits explore the public’s fascination with
espionage — from Junior G-Man toys in the 1930s to James Bond and
Austin Powers movies today.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
204

The museum tells the story of spying from Biblical times to the present,
with a heavy emphasis on the Cold War. Visitors are invited to adopt a
secret identity and to try to maintain it under interrogation, to break
codes, to identify disguised spies, to eavesdrop, and to be the target of
eavesdroppers. There’s a museum store, of course, and two eateries —
Spy City Cafe, for quick meals, and Zola, a full-scale Modern American
restaurant.
Peter Earnest (what a great name for a spy!), the museum’s executive
director, spent 36 years with the CIA. His advisory board includes former
CIA and KGB officers. The museum is located in five restored buildings,
one of which once housed a Communist Party district headquarters. It’s
within easy eavesdropping distance of the FBI across the intersection. The
average visitor spends two hours with the permanent exhibits, an hour
and a quarter in the special exhibits.
See map p. 202. 800 F Street NW (between 8th and 9th streets). % 866-779-6873 or
202-393-7798. www.spymuseum.org. Metro: Gallery Place-Chinatown. From the
9th and G streets exit, walk 1 block south on 9th, cross F, and then turn left on F.
Admission: Adults $16, children 5–11 $13, younger children free, seniors 65 and older
and military and intelligence personnel $15. Hours vary, usually opening no later than
10 a.m., closing no earlier than 6 p.m. Last admission two hours before closing. Call
or check Web site for specifics. Closed Thanksgiving, Dec 25, Jan 1.
Georgetown
Teens have been making Georgetown their own since the days of pegged
pants and poodle skirts. Shops, restaurants, and the overall scene enter-
tain teenagers in this historic neighborhood, which is centered on the
intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street NW. The variety of people
makes it perfect for people-watching. And — teens can be cruel — some
youngsters get great joy from observing the frustration of drivers inch-
ing along in Georgetown’s always-gummed-up traffic.
Commander Salamander (1420 Wisconsin Ave.), Urban Outfitters (3111
M St.), and Up Against the Wall (3219 M St.) are among the shops that
cater to younger shoppers. The Commander (“Nobody calls it the
Commander!” my teenager daughter admonishes me) offers punk-style
clothing, colored wigs, and off-the-wall gifts — think “devil ducks,” red
rubber duckies with devil’s horns. The Outfitters stock slightly offbeat
clothing and accoutrements in a wide price range — fuzzy lamps (why
not?) for decorating a teen’s bedroom and lots of CD accessories. The
Wall folks may be distinguished primarily by what’s free — lots of loud
music. Check out Beyond Comics (1419 Wisconsin Ave.) for comic
books and related toys, dolls, T-shirts, and other such stuff. If your kids
are suffering shopping-mall withdrawal, they can find scores of chain
stores in Georgetown Park (3222 M St.); one of the best for young adults
is H&M, which sells inexpensive but trendy clothing. I won’t tell your
teens about Jinx Proof Tattoos and Piercing Parlor (3289 M St.) or Mrs.
Natalie the palm reader (1500 Wisconsin Ave.).
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 205

A kajillion restaurants are in Georgetown, give or take a few bazillion,
many of them inexpensive and many ideal for carryout food. Before they
actually entered college, Julie and her chums liked to sample college life
by getting sandwiches at Wisemiller’s Grocery & Deli (12361⁄2 36th St.),
near the Georgetown University campus, then finding a seat on a con-
venient wall or set of steps, or heading to the little park south of M near
34th. Dean & Deluca (3276 M St.) is a great place for gourmet carryout,
and it has outdoor tables.
Georgetown is especially well-stocked with ice cream parlors. Dolcezza
Argentine Gelato Cafe (1560 Wisconsin Ave. at Q Street) scoops
Argentinean ice cream. Thomas Sweet (3214 P St. east of Wisconsin) is
locally grown. If your kids are into national brands, Georgetown entices
them with Ben & Jerry’s (3135 M St.) or Häagen-Dazs (3120 M St.).
The 30-series Metrobuses run along Pennsylvania Avenue, M Street, and
Wisconsin Avenue. Georgetown Connection shuttle buses connect with
the Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom–George Washington University, and
Rosslyn Metrorail stations. Another bus, the DC Circulator, runs from
Union Station, through downtown, to Wisconsin Avenue and M.
Energetic teens have no trouble walking from the Foggy Bottom station,
north on 23rd Street to Washington Circle, left around the circle to
Pennsylvania Avenue, and then left on Pennsylvania to M.
Dupont Circle
Like Georgetown, Dupont Circle has all the necessities for people-watching,
eating, and shopping. The park in the circle is a haven for chess players,
recuperating bicycle messengers, and assorted other characters.
Beadazzled (1507 Connecticut Ave.) sells beads (you couldn’t guess?) from
$1 to $100 a piece, plus already-made jewelry and crafts. Kramerbooks &
Afterwords (1517 Connecticut Ave.) is a bookstore where you can eat,
drink, listen to music, and . . . well . . . browse for books. Pizzeria Paradiso
(2029 P St.) is one of the two best pizza parlors in the city and also makes
sandwiches to go. Look at any three doorways in the Dupont Circle area,
and one probably leads into a place to eat. Dupont Circle has its own
Metrorail Station, so it’s really easy to get to.
Union Station
Young people are drawn to Union Station like iron filings to a magnet.
Come here any afternoon or weekend if you don’t believe me. Who’d
have thought that a train station would morph into an upscale mall and
entertainment center? Union Station has all the right stuff that young
people crave: a nine-screen movie theater complex, more than 50 retail-
ers, and a lower-level food court with dozens of vendors. You can eat in
a restaurant or in the brightly decorated food court. Or you can carry
your food outside to the fountain. A Metro stop is right in the basement.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
206

Sports
If your teens are sports buffs, they’ll find Washington to be one of the
best professional sports towns in the country. We’ve got the NFL
Redskins, the NBA Wizards, the NHL Capitals, the WNBA Mystics, the
Major League Soccer D.C. United — and now, after three decades when
the national pastime abandoned the nation’s capital, the Major League
Baseball Nationals. Georgetown University plays big-time college bas-
ketball. The University of Maryland, in suburban College Park, has been
fielding nationally ranked basketball and football teams recently.
Verizon Center (601 F St. NW) is a superb arena and home to the
Wizards, Mystics, Capitals, and some Georgetown games. RFK Stadium
(2400 East Capitol St.) has gray hair and lacks the modern amenities of
skyboxes for the rich, but it’s still a beautiful setting for soccer and base-
ball. The cheap seats in the upper deck behind home plate are really
pretty good. (Bring binoculars.) A Metrorail station is practically in
Verizon Center’s basement, and RFK has a station, too. The Redskins’
FedEx Field (1600 FedEx Way, Landover, MD) is not easily accessible,
but ’Skins tickets are nearly impossible to get anyway.
Music
Verizon Center and RFK Stadium also are venues for big-time pop-music
concerts, as are other stages around town. To keep up with who’s per-
forming, check the ads and listings in the Washington Post — particularly
the Friday “Weekend” section — as well as the Post’s online entertainment
guide (http://eg.washingtonpost.com).
Especially for history buffs
Deciding which attractions fall into this category is a tough call, because
history infuses everything here. When you’re done with the monuments,
memorials, and federal buildings I cite earlier in this chapter, take a look
at these attractions:
Ford’s Theatre & Peterson House
Downtown
Closed for more than a century after President Lincoln was assassinated
here on April 14, 1865, Ford’s Theatre became a showcase for plays and
concerts again in 1968. You can attend a performance here. And you can
tour the scene, viewing the presidential box as it looked the night John
Wilkes Booth shot the president during a performance of Our American
Cousin.
In the basement, the Lincoln Museum displays the clothing Lincoln was
wearing that night, the .44 caliber Derringer that Booth used, and other
memorabilia associated with Lincoln and the assassination. Across the
street, you can visit the place where Lincoln died, the Petersen House, 516
10th St. NW. You can spend about an hour touring the two locations.

ances, rehearsals, and work on set.
Frederick Douglass National Historic Site
Anacostia
This 21-room house was home to Frederick Douglass, the 19th-century
abolitionist and civil rights leader, who was born a slave and eventually
served as a District of Columbia Council member, D.C.’s U.S. marshal, and
U.S. minister to Haiti. The home and visitor center feature original fur-
nishings and tell the story of Douglass’s remarkable life. Be sure to see the
short film for an overview of his life. A bookstore and restrooms are on-
site. Space is limited, so call ahead to find the best time to visit and to
make a reservation. Plan to spend an hour here.
See map p. 202. 1411 W St. SE (at 14th Street). % 800-967-2283 or 202-426-5961.

Newseum
Downtown
Journalism has been called the “first rough draft of history,” which is why
I’m putting this institution in this section of this book. The Newseum hasn’t
reopened as I write this, so I have to rely on what the Newseum folks have
announced rather than my own eyes. But, if it’s anything like its prede-
cessor — and it should be better! — everyone, including kids, will find a
visit enjoyable and educational. People involved in the news business will
love checking this place out. Everyone who is affected by news — and
that’s everyone — should come to get a better understanding of how and
why the news is reported as it is. The earlier Newseum, across the
Potomac River in Rosslyn, made the story of journalism come to life with
state-of-the-art technology. This new Newseum, scheduled to open in fall
2007, will be state-of-the-artier. The institution will explore five centuries
of news history and offer behind-the-scenes looks at how news is gathered
and published in print and electronic media. Visitors will be able to watch
television news feeds from around the world, see displays of 80 newspaper
front pages each day, and have electronic access to more than 500.
Freedom is the Newseum’s key theme, and it will display key documents
in freedom’s evolution, including rare editions of the Magna Carta, 
the Federalist Papers, and the first pamphlet printing of the U.S.
Constitution. Documenting another key moment in the march of freedom,
the Newseum will display fragments of the Berlin Wall. Other features:
an exhibit on revered radio and television newsman Edward R. Murrow,
a documentary about the “Golden Age” of television news from 1954 to
1969, a gallery of Pulitzer Prize–winning photojournalism, a gallery
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C.

devoted to news coverage of the 9/11 attacks, and a memorial to more
than 1,600 journalists killed while reporting the news. The building also
will house a food court and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.
See map p. 202. 555 Pennsylvania Ave. NW (at 6th Street). % 888-639-7386 or
703-284-3544. www.newseum.org. Metro: Archives/Navy Memorial. From the Metro
exit, walk toward the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue 1 block. Opening in Fall 2007.
Admission: Not determined. Open: Hours not determined.
Old Stone House
Georgetown
In the heart of Georgetown — and easy to pass given its diminutive size —
is one of Washington’s oldest buildings. Built in 1765, it predates the United
States and the District of Columbia. It’s furnished as it was when
Georgetown was a thriving tobacco port. Ask the ranger to tell you about
the place. Most visitors are struck by the interior space, or lack thereof. Be
sure to look out back at the lovely garden, abloom from April to November.
You can also bring lunch and join picnickers who brown-bag it on the lawn.
Plan to spend 15 minutes here, more if you do lunch.
See map p. 202. 3051 M St. NW (between 30th and 31st streets). % 202-426-6851.
www.nps.gov/olst. Take Georgetown Connection shuttle bus from Dupont Circle
or Rosslyn Metrorail station to M and 30th or Thomas Jefferson Street or ride 30-
series Metrobus or the Circulator. Admission: Free. House open: Daily noon–5 p.m.
Garden open: Daily during daylight hours. Closed Dec 25.
Woodrow Wilson House
North of Dupont Circle
After his term ended in 1921, Woodrow Wilson, America’s 28th president,
lived the last three years of his life in this Georgian Revival home, which
was built in 1915. Depending on how you view Bill Clinton’s current resi-
dency status, Wilson was the only president to live in Washington after his
term expired. (Bill and Hillary bought a D.C. house after she was elected
U.S. senator from New York, but their official residence is in the state she
represents.) Many of the gifts Wilson received from world leaders — as
well as his inaugural Bible, specs, and a shell casing from World War I —
are among the artifacts displayed in the house. According to the docents,
the residence/museum looks very much as it did when Wilson lived in it.
Touring the place properly takes about an hour.
See map p. 202. 2340 S St. NW (between 23rd and 24th streets). % 202-387-4062.
www.woodrowwilsonhouse.org. Metro: Dupont Circle. From the Q Street exit,
walk 2 blocks west on Q, right on Massachusetts Avenue 4 blocks, right on 24th

up Massachusetts. Or take a taxi. Admission: $7.50, seniors $6.50, students $3, chil-
dren younger than seven free. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 209

Especially for art lovers
Art galleries paint many D.C. neighborhoods, but the biggest concentra-
tion is in Georgetown, around 7th Street NW in the Penn Quarter neigh-
borhood, and on the National Mall. For the Georgetown galleries, take
the Metro to Foggy Bottom, walk north to Pennsylvania Avenue, then
walk to where Pennsylvania ends at M Street. You also can take the
Georgetown Connection shuttle bus from the Foggy Bottom, Dupont
Circle, or Rosslyn Metrorail station, or ride the Circulator. Many galleries
are on M and along Wisconsin Avenue between M and R streets. To
reach the 7th Street galleries, between D and G streets, take the Metro to
the Archives-Navy Memorial station and walk north on 7th.
The top gallery in town, of course, is the National Gallery, which I tell
you about in the first section of this chapter. Also see the first section
for the American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. I can’t
tell you about all the other galleries around Georgetown, Penn Quarter,
and the Mall, but these are some of the best:
Corcoran Gallery
Downtown
You can find Washington’s first art museum — and D.C.’s largest private
art museum — just a block from the White House. The Corcoran was
founded in 1869 “for the purpose of encouraging the American genius.” Its
collection traces America’s artistic development from colonial times to the
present. It also contains a significant number of European works. Julie likes
to come here to see the works of students in the Corcoran College of Art
and Design. The Corcoran has a cafe, a noteworthy museum shop, and an
auditorium which hosts concerts, films, and other activities. Tours of the
collection leave from the information desk at noon Wednesday through
Saturday, plus 7:30 p.m. Thursday, and 2:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
Figure on spending about an hour here.

Freer and Sackler Galleries of Art
National Mall
Although these neighboring galleries store and display their collections in
separate buildings, they’re connected by underground exhibition space and
together comprise the Smithsonian’s Museum of Asian Art. The Freer also
contains the world’s finest collection of Whistlers (James McNeill Whistler,
that is), and of some other American artists from the late 19th and early
20th centuries. If you’ve never seen the Peacock Room, that alone is reason
to visit the Freer. Take the guided tour (from the information desk daily at
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
210

12:15 p.m. except Wed and Federal holidays) to discover the fascinating
history behind Whistler’s stunning dining room, created for a London town
house and moved to the Mall after the owner’s death. Sackler tours leave
its info desk at the same time.
The Freer houses a world-renowned collection of art from Asia and the
Near East. Highlights include Chinese paintings, Japanese folding screens,
Korean ceramics, Buddhist sculpture, and Indian and Persian manuscripts.
The Sackler’s highlights include early Chinese bronzes and jades, Chinese
paintings and lacquerware, ancient Near Eastern ceramics and metalware,
South and Southeast Asian sculpture, and Islamic arts. Budget at least a
half-hour for each museum.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
National Mall
I get a charge out of standing directly beneath Kenneth Snelson’s 60-foot-
high “Needle Tower,” just outside the Hirshhorn, and looking straight up.
I must admit that much abstract and contemporary art is not to my taste.
But some of it turns me on, and this aluminum-and-steel, TV-tower-like
structure is one example.
If modern and contemporary art is your thing, then the Hirshhorn is your
museum. All the top guns are here: Benton, Christo, Close, Gorky, Miró,
O’Keeffe, Warhol, Bacon, de Kooning, Matisse . . . you get the — uh —
picture. And, of course, the museum has many special exhibits. Across
Jefferson Drive is the sunken Sculpture Garden, with more than 60 works
by Rodin, Moore, Calder, and others (a particularly neat place in winter
when the statues are draped in snow).
You can catch a museum tour at 10:30 a.m. and noon weekdays, noon and
2 p.m. weekends. Sculpture Garden tours are offered (weather permitting)
Monday through Saturday at 10:30 a.m. June through September. Inquire

National Museum of Women in the Arts
Downtown
Housed in a landmark Downtown building that once served as a Masonic
Temple, the privately managed National Museum of Women in the Arts has
compiled a collection of 2,700 works by more than 800 artists since
Wilhelmina Cole Holladay and Wallace F. Holladay began compiling their
personal collection in the 1960s. That collection comprised the core of the
museum when it was incorporated in 1981 and moved into its current
quarters in 1987. The museum seeks to acquire the works of women artists
of all periods and all nationalities.

Phillips Collection
Dupont Circle
In the former home of collector and benefactor Duncan Phillips, you find
the works of modern artists and of the earlier artists who influenced them.
The Phillips bills itself as America’s first museum of modern art, but it also
believes in showing “the continuum of art and artists influencing their suc-
cessors through the centuries.” Duncan Phillips collected El Greco, for
example, because he was the “first impassioned expressionist.” The
Phillips is noted for Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings. You
find Renoir’s Luncheon of the Boating Party here, as well as works by such
other notable artists as van Gogh, Monet, Degas, Gauguin, Cézanne,
Rothko, Matisse, de Kooning, Hopper, and O’Keeffe.
When you tour the original galleries of the Phillips, you really do feel as if
you’re exploring a private collection in an elegant private home. An expan-
sion completed in 2006 gives the Phillips modern exhibition space as well.
In addition to increasing display space, that project added a 180-seat audi-
torium, a hands-on activity room, a courtyard, a new cafe, and a new shop,
among other facilities. You can join an introductory tour of the collection
on Saturday and of any special exhibition on Friday, both at 11 a.m.
Classical music concerts are presented here at 4 p.m. Sundays October
through May, lectures and other programs on Thursday evenings.

Renwick Gallery
Downtown
Across from the White House, this striking Second Empire building shows
off American crafts from the 19th century to the present. Rotating exhibits
from the gallery’s permanent collection are displayed in the second floor
galleries.
Among the more notable are Larry Fuente’s Game Fish, with its glittering
scales of game pieces, buttons, and beads, and Albert Paley’s Portal Gates,
made from forged steel, brass, copper, and bronze. Temporary exhibits of
American crafts and decorative arts are shown on the first floor. Wood turn-
ing, leaded glasswork, and quilts are just a few of the crafts to be featured.

Textile Museum
North of Dupont Circle
More than 17,000 objects, dating from 3,000 B.C. to the present, are held in
the Textile Museum’s collection. It all started with George Hewitt Myers’s
Chinese silks, tapestries, and hand-woven Oriental rugs. The gift shop is
noteworthy, too, featuring silk scarves and ties, Tibetan rug squares, and
other interesting items. Susan bought an Oriental rug mouse pad here.

Stopping to smell the roses: Gardens and peaceful spots
You can find a lot of green spaces in and around Washington, many
dating back to the founding of the city, and some even before that time.
The temperate climate (well, in the spring and fall, anyway) means that
the gardens are blooming pretty much throughout the year.
Dumbarton Oaks
Georgetown
If you’re looking for a place to entertain both kids and grandparents, the
Dumbarton Oaks gardens fit the bill. In fact, the first time Susan and I
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 213

checked out this place, it was with my parents and our then-little daugh-
ter in tow. The big folks loved exploring the plantings. Julie loved running
around and letting off steam.
Robert and Mildred Bliss — wealthy collectors of Byzantine and pre-
Columbian art and of books on gardens — purchased this 19th-century
mansion in 1920, then restored and expanded it over the years. In 1940,
they donated the building, some of the grounds, their collections, and an
endowment to Harvard University, which uses the property as a study
center and museum.
The mansion hosted the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations — international
discussions that laid the foundations for the United Nations — in 1944.
The art from the Byzantine Empire is considered by many the most impor-
tant Byzantine collection in America. Mildred Bliss employed noted land-
scape gardener Beatrix Farrand to design the gardens, which were
envisioned as a unique American incorporation of elements from tradi-
tional French, English, and Italian gardens. They’re in bloom from early
spring through fall. Blooming starts in mid-March and April with cherry
trees, forsythia, wisteria, azaleas, dogwood, lilacs, and magnolias and ends
in October with chrysanthemums.
The mansion, with its art displays, has been closed during a lengthy ren-
ovation. It was scheduled to reopen during 2007.

Enid A. Haupt Garden
The Mall
This 4.2-acre park, located between the Smithsonian Castle and
Independence Avenue, is a pleasant place to rest when you’re touring the
National Mall. It’s named for the woman who endowed it, an heir to the
Annenburg publishing fortune and a one-time editor and publisher of
Seventeen magazine who loved gardens and could afford to finance them.
The Haupt Garden actually is a collection of gardens that grow above the
underground sections of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, the
National Museum of African Art, and the S. Dillon Ripley Center’s
International Gallery. The Parterre is a large flower bed, lined with benches,
in which designs are formed with the dirt, grass, shrubs, and flowers. The
Moongate Garden was inspired by the Temple of Heaven in Beijing; it fea-
tures a circular granite “island” and granite walkways that bridge the water.
Catch your breath, rest your feet, and reflect before moving on to the next
museum.

Lafayette Square
Downtown
Once part of the White House North Lawn and now separated from the
lawn by Pennsylvania Avenue and the White House fence, Lafayette Square
is a marvelous place for sitting, snacking, or even stretching out on the
grass. Gazing to the south, you see the White House with the Washington
Monument peeking over the roof in the near distance. To the west are his-
toric houses that lead you to feel you’re visiting a 19th-century town
square. You can check out an ethnically diverse collection of statues —
Marquis de Lafayette, for whom the square is named, the Comte Jean de
Rochambeau, Thaddeus Kosciusko, Baron Frederich von Steuben, and
Andrew Jackson on horseback.
The park attracts lunching workers from nearby office buildings, resting
tourists, and a diverse collection of demonstrators who like to display
their signs at the president’s door. Over the centuries, the land has accom-
modated a farmhouse, an apple orchard, a cemetery, and a racetrack.
According to the National Park Service, it’s also home to “the highest den-
sity of squirrels per square acre ever recorded.” Try to ignore the post-
9/11 security barriers.

United States Botanic Garden
Capitol Hill
The nation’s greenhouse sits in a sort of no-man’s land just west of Capitol
Hill, but not really on the National Mall. Because it’s run by Congress, I call
it a Capitol Hill attraction. And attractive it is, having just been through a
major-major-major renovation.
About 4,000 plants are on display inside the Conservatory. More are in the
gardens just outside the Conservatory and across Independence Avenue
in Bartholdi Park. The park also contains the Bartholdi Fountain, created
for the 1876 International Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia by Frederic
Auguste Bartholdi, the French designer of the Statue of Liberty.
Ask at the information desk about free 45-minute tours of the Conservatory
that are conducted from time to time. Or you can just wander about on
your own. The conservatory is particularly appealing in winter, when it
serves as a tropical respite from the cold. It’s a great place to visit in the
Christmas season, when poinsettias brighten holiday spirits.

Especially for architecture buffs
Just about every building on the D.C. tourist itinerary has something to
offer architecture enthusiasts. You can spend hours — days — studying
the details of the great government buildings, such as the Capitol, the
White House, the Supreme Court, and the Library of Congress. Many of
the monuments are architectural triumphs, such as the Jefferson
Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and
the Washington Monument, to name a few. If you take the train to Beaux
Arts Union Station or fly into National Airport, you’re instantly exposed
to the fascinating architecture of these transportation hubs.
Mount Vernon
Virginia
One reason George Washington placed the capital where he did is its prox-
imity to Mount Vernon, the Founding Father’s plantation. This estate
across the Potomac River is about 15 miles and more than 200 years away
from modern-day D.C. A stop at the riverside mansion, meticulously
restored down to the original paint colors on the walls, is the perfect com-
plement to a visit in the federal district bearing George’s name. The land
was granted to Washington’s great-grandfather in 1674. G.W. lived here
most of his life, with time out for being a soldier and a president. He died
and was buried here in 1799. What a setting! He certainly had an eye for
prime real estate.
Mount Vernon is a typical 18th-century aristocratic estate. Learn about
George and his times in the new orientation and education centers.
Explore the house and grounds on your own. Guides are stationed
throughout the mansion to answer your questions. Take a minute, espe-
cially with youngsters, to inspect the family kitchen and outbuildings
where baking, weaving, and washing took place. George and other family
members are interred in a tomb a short walk from the mansion.
Mount Vernon commemorates the Presidents’ Day holiday, the third
Monday in February, by admitting visitors for free and hosting a wreath-
laying at Washington’s tomb, with music and military exercises by the U.S.
Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps. On February 22, Washington’s actual
birthday, anyone who is named George or was born on that date gets free
admission.
From late November to early December, candlelight tours of the mansion
are conducted from 5 to 8 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Costumed charac-
ters, including Martha Washington, speak with the tourists. Tickets go on
sale November 1 and do sell out.
Mount Vernon hosts special events throughout the year, including hands-
on activities for children. Call to find out what’s going on during your visit.
The grounds are a great place for little kids to explore — and run off
energy — while their parents take turns touring the house.
Mount Vernon has a food court and a full-service restaurant, the Mount
Vernon Inn (% 703-780-0011; www.mountvernon.org/visit/dining).

National Airport
Virginia
Because travelers often heed advice to get to the airport early, they find
themselves with lots of time on their hands. If you have extra time, you
may want to tour National Airport on your way out of town. Here’s how
much of an attraction this place is: Just before the new terminal opened in
1997, thousands of Washingtonians showed up for an open house.
What you find here is the historically interesting old Terminal A and the
modern new terminal. Because of heightened security, only ticketed pas-
sengers are allowed access to the gate concourses. But you can see much
of the interesting stuff from outside those security checkpoints.
State-of-the-art when it opened in 1941, Terminal A was designed to be
both “modern” and reflective of the area’s Colonial and Neoclassical archi-
tecture. It was built on a curve and features a multilevel waiting room with
picture windows that look over the runways to the Washington skyline
across the Potomac River. It will be restored to its 1941 condition and con-
tinues to house gates, ticket counters, and concessions.
The new terminal also offers picture-window views of Washington land-
marks. The first things you notice, of course, are the glass and metal in the
walls, ceilings, and roof, with 54 domes designed to suggest Thomas
Jefferson’s contributions to architecture. Works by 30 artists are incorpo-
rated into the floors, walls, windows, and other elements of the terminal
in various materials, including stained glass, marble, terrazzo, cast bronze,
hammered aluminum and copper, painted steel, porcelain, enamel, paint
on board, and paint on canvas. As a practical, functioning airport, it’s easy
to navigate and has an unusually good collection of eating and shopping
spots.

National Building Museum
Downtown
The best place to begin an architecture tour of Washington is the National
Building Museum, dedicated to architecture, design, engineering, con-
struction, and urban planning. The museum itself occupies a fascinating
building. Designed in 1881 and opened in 1887, it was constructed to house
the Pension Bureau, a predecessor of today’s Department of Veterans
Affairs.
Among the building’s most striking features is a 3-foot-high terra-cotta
frieze that wraps for 1,200 feet around the entire exterior. Designed by
Caspar Buberl, the frieze depicts a parade of Civil War soldiers. Working
before the advent of modern air-conditioning and efficient electric light-
ing, architect Montgomery C. Meigs employed a system of windows, vents,
and open archways to bathe the Great Hall in light and air. The Great Hall
has a central fountain and eight 75-foot-tall Corinthian columns that are
among the tallest interior columns in the world. Its monumental dimen-
sions and spectacular appearance make the Great Hall a popular site for
major events, including presidential inaugural balls. (If you’d like to host
a party here, rental fees start at $11,000.)
The focus of the museum is on the building process, architectural styles,
and construction techniques. The collection contains 40,000 photographs,
68,000 prints and drawings, 100 linear feet of documents, and 2,100 objects
such as construction materials and architectural fragments. Planned spe-
cial exhibits include “Reinventing the Globe: A Shakespearean Theater for
the 21st Century,” in which five architects and set designers create hypo-
thetical Shakespearean theaters for this century (through Aug 27, 2007),
“House and Home: 400 Years of Domestic Architecture” (opening spring
2008), and “Designing the World of Tomorrow: America’s World’s Fairs of
the 1930s” (opening late 2008 or early 2009). A long-term exhibit is
“Washington: Symbol and City,” which tells the story of how the nation’s
capital grew to its current form.
Family-oriented programs are scheduled throughout the year; call or check
the museum’s Web site for details. Exhibits sometimes contain interactive
elements aimed at youngsters. In the Building Zone, kids ages three to six
can erect their own structure.

The Octagon Museum
Foggy Bottom
The Octagon is a museum of architecture and an architecturally interest-
ing building. It’s also a place where international history was made.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
218

President and Mrs. Madison fled to this mansion after the British set fire
to the White House during the War of 1812. It was here that Madison
received and signed the Treaty of Ghent, which ended that war. The OSS,
predecessor to the CIA, set up shop in the Octagon during World War II,
and the National Trust for Historic Preservation was headquartered here
immediately afterward.
Built between 1799 and 1801, the Octagon is one of the oldest structures
in the Capital and one of the best examples of Federal architecture in the
country. The Octagon was designed by William Thornton, the first archi-
tect of the U.S. Capitol. Strangely, it doesn’t have eight sides. While it’s not
known how the Octagon acquired its name, it may have come from the
round entrance hall. According to the American Architectural Foundation,
round rooms in the 18th century often were formed from eight angled walls
that were plastered smooth into a circle and were referred to as “octagon
salons.” The house was built for John and Ann Ogle Tayloe, who raised 15
children in the Octagon and continued to live here until their deaths —
John’s in 1828, Ann’s in 1855.
Visitors can tour the house and explore exhibits. If you tour the building,
you see the Octagon as it looked during the last 11 years of John Tayloe’s
life. The museum collection includes more than 100,000 architectural
drawings, 30,000 historic photographs, 760 pieces of decorative arts, and
nearly 14,000 archeological artifacts and architectural fragments from the
building and its grounds, as well as scrapbooks, sketchbooks, manu-
scripts, and models.
The Octagon was closed to the general public for a long-term improvement
project which began in 2006. During that project, pre-arranged tours were
available only to groups of at least ten. Call to find out if that’s changed at
the time of your visit.

Union Station
Capitol Hill
This is Washington’s back-to-the-future headquarters. After years of blight,
Union Station has become the most bustling hub in town. The train is the
very best way to travel in the Washington–New York corridor today.
Hordes of subway travelers use the Metrorail station here daily. Maryland
and Virginia commuter trains converge here. Cabs line up for business.
Tour buses come and go. And — as I detail in Chapter 12 and elsewhere in
the book — Union Station is a great place for shopping, eating, movie-
going, and teens hanging out. More than 25 million people pass through
this place every year.
The building is, indeed, a railroad palace. It was designed in grand Beaux
Arts style by Daniel Burnham, who gathered inspiration from the Diocletian
Baths and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. When construction was 
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 219

completed in 1908, Union Station occupied more land area than any other
U.S. building and there was no bigger train station in the world. Presidents
really used the President’s Room (now home to B. Smith’s Restaurant), and
kings, queens, and other world leaders passed through with regularity.
Airplanes and interstate highways drove the station into a long decline.
But a monumental renovation campaign led to a spectacular reopening in
1988, and now you can gaze upon the grandeur that welcomed travelers
nearly a century ago — with a lot of new amenities.
A fountain and statue of Columbus stand outside the building, along with
a replica of the Liberty Bell. The facade is festooned with eagles. Inside,
sculptures of Roman soldiers by Augustus Sant-Gaudens stand guard over
the Main Hall, which features a 96-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The East
Hall boasts stenciled skylights. At the east end of the East Hall, be sure to
peek into B. Smith’s to see the soaring ceilings and ornate architecture of
the President’s Room.

Washington National Cathedral
Upper Northwest
The cathedral, founded to serve all faiths (though it’s affiliated with the
Episcopal denomination), raises its towers higher than anything else in
Washington and can be seen throughout D.C. and into the Virginia suburbs.
President Theodore Roosevelt and the bishop of London participated in
the laying of the foundation stone, which came from a field near Bethlehem,
in 1907. Like its European predecessors, this cathedral — officially named
the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul — wasn’t built in a day.
Constructed in the traditional “stone-on-stone” method (no structural
steel), the building was completed in 1990.
You can find much to see and do here, outside as well as inside. Guided
tours of the cathedral leave from the west entrance off Wisconsin Avenue
daily. Check this Web site (www.cathedral.org/cathedral/visit/
tour.shtml) for details of this and other tours. You can rent an audio tour
or wander about on your own. Whatever you do, be sure to check out the
gardens as well as the interior.
The real business of the church — weddings, funerals, worship services, and
the like — supersedes touring. Some programs are offered on irregular sched-
ules, so calling before you visit is wise. Kids 6 to 12 enjoy the Gargoyle’s Den,
held in the crypt classroom Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. They can try
stone carving, make a gargoyle, work with stained glass and mosaics, and
learn about cathedral construction. After the workshop, children can join 
a supervised scavenger hunt around the cathedral. Children should have
adult companions. Fee varies from $1 to $5. Youngsters 10 and older enjoy
the gargoyle tour, 2 p.m. on the fourth Sunday of each month from April
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C.

through October, also 6:30 p.m. on the fourth Thursday May through July,
$5. Bring binoculars, and look for Darth Vader.
The cathedral is a bit off the standard tourist path, but you can grab a
good lunch or dinner at several neighborhood restaurants:
 2 Amys (see review in Chapter 10). This place serves the best pizza
in town — real Neapolitan pizza, with thin, chewy crust. It’s a great
spot for kids.
 Cactus Cantina (3300 Wisconsin Ave. NW, north of Macomb Street;
% 202-686-7222), a large, boisterous Tex-Mex spot with an outdoor
dining area, where my daughter once encountered President Bush
II and his entourage.
 Cafe Deluxe (3228 Wisconsin Ave., south of Macomb; % 202-686-
2233), a bistro with indoor and outdoor tables and an eclectic menu
of New American and traditional comfort foods with a twist: burgers,
chicken pot pie, grilled meatloaf with Creole sauce, pan roasted hal-
ibut with corn and asparagus sauté, and penne pasta with chicken
and asparagus.
You can take tea after a tour of the Cathedral itself on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays, except for some holidays. Tour begins at 1:30 p.m. inside the
west entrance off Wisconsin Avenue. Tea is served at tour’s end in the
Pilgrim Observation Gallery, where you can gaze through arched windows
at the city and beyond. It costs $22 per person, and you need to make reser-
vations as early as six months ahead of time by calling % 202-537-8993.

Seeing Washington by Guided Tour
Travelers with limited time and/or limited mobility can benefit from taking
a general orientation tour. So can visitors who like to check out the forest
before inspecting the trees. Guided tours also make sense for those with
kids in tow, seniors, and travelers with special interests. In Washington,
you can tour historic, cultural, and even scandal-ridden sites. And you can
do it by bus, bike, boat, motorized scooter, and foot — for an hour or for a
day or more.
Chapter 11: Discovering Washington, D.C.’s, Best Attractions 221

General orientation tours
Tourmobile (% 202-554-5100; www.tourmobile.com) takes the prize as
the best general tour operator in the city. The area’s largest sightseeing
organization is licensed by the National Park Service and operates its
trams year-round.
The company’s American Heritage Tour makes about two dozen tram
stops on or near the Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue, then heads off to
Arlington Cemetery for another four stops. You can get off and on the
trams as often as you like during the day. Some visitors remain on board
for an entire loop, listening as the Tourmobile guide points out places of
interest and discusses their history, then take a second go-round, getting
off at spots that interest them.
Using Tourmobile is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with the major
tourist areas. One-day tickets cost $20 for adults, $10 for kids 3 to 11, and
free for younger tots. You can purchase tickets from the driver or at ticket
booths at select boarding points along the tram route. Tourmobile runs
from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily except December 25 and January 1. Final
reboarding is 3:30 p.m.
If you find the prospect of tackling both D.C. and Arlington in one day
too taxing, Tourmobile offers a separate Arlington Cemetery Tour. The
cost is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors 65 and older, $5 for children 3 to 11,
and free for those younger. You can purchase tickets at the Arlington
Cemetery Visitors Center. This tour departs the visitor center daily
except December 25 from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. from April through
September and 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. the rest of the year.
Old Town Trolley (% 202-832-9800; www.historictours.com/
washington) operates much like Tourmobile, except you ride in a bus
outfitted to look like an old-time trolley car. You can get on and off the
trolley whenever the spirit moves you. It takes about two and a quarter
hours for a trolley to complete one loop. First departure from Union
Station is at 9 a.m. Trolleys stop running at 5:30 p.m., 4:30 p.m. in winter.
(Inquire about the final departure from the last stop you plan to use.)
Trolleys don’t run July 4, December 25, Thanksgiving, the Sunday of
Memorial Day weekend, and during the Marine Corps Marathon. Prices
are $32 for adults, $16 children ages 4 to 12, younger kids are free.
For the same prices, the Trolley will take you on a two-and-a-half-hour
Monuments by Moonlight tour that lets you see D.C.’s memorials and
monuments illuminated in all their nighttime glory — at least during part
of the tour. The guides let you in on such secrets as which president’s
ghost haunts Congress. (Which ones don’t?) The tour departs nightly
from Union Station at 6:30 p.m. during fall and winter and 7:30 p.m. in
spring and summer. It doesn’t run January 1, July 4, Thanksgiving,
December 25, or December 31. Reservations are required. The best time
to take this tour is late fall and winter, when the entire Moonlight Tour
actually takes place after dark.

You can buy discounted tickets at the Old Town Trolley Web site.
Gray Line (% 800-862-1400; www.grayline.com) offers an extensive
array of D.C. tours, as well as trips to Maryland and Virginia attractions
by motor coach, usually from the Gray Line terminal in Union Station.
Always call ahead to confirm departure times and points because
they’re subject to change. Here’s a sampling of the company’s touring
options.
 L’il Red Trolley Tours are similar to Tourmobile and Old Town
Trolley and make a continuous loop around Washington. Some
stops include the Capitol, the National Zoo, Arlington Cemetery,
and several spots along the Mall. Riders can hop on and off as they
choose. The tour costs $25 for adults, $10 for children.
 The Public Buildings Tour is a nine-hour trek past and through
monuments, museums, memorials, government buildings, and his-
torical sites. The tour starts at 8:30 a.m. Monday through Saturday
and costs $45 for ages 12 and older, $22 for kids 3 to 11, younger
kids free.
 Gray Line starts its three-hour after-dark tour nightly at 7:45 p.m.
except on January 1, July 4, Thanksgiving, December 24, December
25, and December 31. Cost is $35 for ages 12 and older, $17 for ages
3 to 11, free for younger.
 A nine-hour Combination Tour takes in top D.C. sites plus visits to
Arlington National Cemetery, George Washington’s Mount Vernon
home, and Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The tour departs at 8:30
a.m. daily except Thanksgiving, December 25, January 1, and July 4.
It costs $57 for those 12 and older, and $28 for kids 3 to 11, younger
free.
Gray Line also runs excursions to Monticello, Colonial Williamsburg, and
Gettysburg.
The people who bring you the Old Town Trolley also run DC Ducks
tours (% 202-832-9800; www.historictours.com/washington), an
entertaining combination of history and silliness. Utilizing amphibious
vehicles that transported troops and supplies during World War II, they
take visitors past several major D.C. attractions before plunging into the
Potomac to float past more sights. The 90-minute keels-on-wheels tours
depart daily on the hour from Union Station 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in spring
and summer. Tours may be cancelled in bad weather, so it pays to phone
ahead. Tickets cost $28 for ages 13 and up, $14 for children 4 to 12.
Younger kids ride free and discounts are available at the Web site. The
drivers will be wise-quacking, and eventually so will you.
DC Ducks seating is first-come, first-seated, so show up early or you may
have to wait another hour for your ride.

River tours
Hit the deck and see the capital city’s pretty face from the Potomac —
on a real boat, not a duck. For a 45-minute narrated float, take one of the
Capitol River Cruises’ boats from Georgetown’s Washington Harbour
dock (bottom of 31st Street). The cruise runs hourly noon to 8 p.m.
every day April through October, and until 9 p.m. Memorial Day through
Labor Day. The cost is $12 for adults and $6 for kids 3 to 12. Call % 800-
405-5511 or 301-460-7447 or visit its Web site at www.capitolriver
cruises.com.
Canal rides
Board a mule-drawn canal boat for a trip along the historic C&O Canal.
The Georgetown is berthed in (where else?) Georgetown, near the
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park visitor center (1057
Thomas Jefferson St. NW, just south of M Street). From early April
through October, the boat plies the canal for delightful one-hour rides,
manned (and womaned) by volunteers in period clothing, while National
Park Service rangers narrate. Schedules vary, so call % 202-653-5190 or
check the Web at www.nps.gov/choh for details. Tickets are $8, seniors
$6, kids $5.
Bike tours
Several guided bicycle tours are available through Bike the Sites (% 202-
842-2453; www.bikethesites.com). The Capital Sites Tour covers
everything between the Lincoln Memorial and the Supreme Court. The
journey lasts three hours and covers 7 to 8 miles of easy pedaling, nearly
all on flat land. Other tours of between two and three and a half hours
focus on landmarks at night, monuments, sculptures, and D.C.-based
movies. There also are special tours for families with kids. The guide
stops frequently so bikers can consume some history and humor with
their granola bars. Most tours cost $40, $30 for kids 12 and younger, and
include bike, helmet, water, and snack. Tours leave from a purple and
yellow kiosk on 12th Street NW between Pennsylvania and Constitution
avenues, across 12th from the Federal Triangle Metrorail Station. Call for
times and to make reservations.
If you want a bike to explore Washington on your own, Bike the Sites will
be happy to rent one to you.

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Visiting the big brands and unique local shops
 Exploring great shopping neighborhoods
 Hitting the outdoor markets
 Shopping for specific needs
I
know that shopping isn’t your top reason for coming to Washington.
And I know that, to the extent you’d like to taste some of the shop-
ping Washington has to offer, you don’t want to visit the same national
chains you can find back home. So, as I consider the shopping that you
may want — or need — to do here, I’ll clue you in to the local shops, as
well as the familiar names.
Surveying the Shopping Scene
You won’t find much clothing, furniture, or fashion made in D.C. Wash-
ington focuses more on making laws, rules, regulations, and headlines.
But the Washington area does have artists and craftspeople whose work
is displayed in D.C. galleries. And certain shops seek out interesting
products that aren’t found in run-of-the-mill retail establishments.
You’ll find the best buys to be had are at the museum and gallery shops,
because they make an effort to sell things related to their collections —
things you can’t locate in your average suburban shopping mall.
It’s impossible to talk about the best times to find sales or general shop-
ping hours anymore. Shoppers demand sales, so the typical retailer puts
on some kind of sale most of the time. Retailers also set their shopping
hours according to their perceptions of their customers’ work schedules
and shopping habits, and as part of special promotions.
Call ahead if you want to know a certain store’s hours. Otherwise, you
can be fairly confident that most D.C. stores will be open at least from
late morning to early evening. You’re more likely to find late-night shops
in late-night entertainment areas.

Don’t forget to factor in your contribution to the local government’s cof-
fers when you consider the price of an item. The sales tax is 5.75 percent
in Washington, 5 percent in Maryland, and 4.5 percent in Virginia. Thank
you for your support!
Checking Out the Big Names
Washington lost its last local department store name — Hecht’s — 
when Federated Department Stores decided to tag everything Macy’s
or Bloomingdale’s. Hecht’s old flagship store Downtown, at the Metro
Center Metrorail Station, is now a Macy’s (1201 G St. NW; % 202-628-
6661). Hecht’s old Friendship Heights store — which previously had
been Woodward & Lothrop, another deceased local business — was 
torn down, and a new Bloomingdale’s is being built on the site.
Neiman Marcus (% 202-966-9700; www.neimanmarcus.com) — the
Texas-based emporium that sells six-figure Christmas gifts and is pick-
eted regularly by antifur activists — anchors one side of Mazza Gallerie,
an urban shopping mall at 5300 Wisconsin Ave. It’s right at the Friend-
ship Heights Metrorail Station.
Lord & Taylor, best known for women’s clothing, is at 5255 Western Ave.
NW, also near the Friendship Heights Metrorail Station (% 202-362-
9600; www.lordandtaylor.com).
Saks Fifth Avenue’s Maryland store is a rather regal structure that
stands oddly alone in the midst of its own large parking lot at 5555
Wisconsin Ave. (% 301-657-9000; www.saksfifthavenue.com). The
Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store sits across Mazza Gallerie’s main lobby
from Neiman Marcus, at 5300 Wisconsin Ave. NW (% 202-363-2059).
Taking It to the Street
Old-fashioned markets of various kinds are still alive and kicking in
Washington. The early dog gets the flea — or something like that —
when shoppers battle for bargains at flea markets. Don’t be afraid to bar-
gain for your bargain. A lot of folks think that’s the main reason to fre-
quent flea markets. The best one in Washington is Capitol Hill’s Eastern
Market (7th Street SE, between C Street and North Carolina Avenue; 
% 202-544-0083; www.easternmarket.net; Metro: Eastern Market). It’s
a riot of activity on weekends. Scores upon scores of farmers, grocers,
artists, craftsmen, and vendors peddle their wares inside the historic
market building and in the open spaces and storefronts that surround it.
Chefs join the locals and party-givers who shop here on Saturday, when
the produce and flowers are especially plentiful. Activity occurs all week
long inside the Victorian-era building, where various butchers, bakers,
fishmongers, and grocers have their permanent stands in the South Hall.
The North Hall has been turned into an arts-and-crafts center, open

Hunting Down Best Buys in D.C.’s 
Prime Shopping Zones
During your time in D.C., perhaps as a break from all that sightseeing,
you may want to check out the following shopping areas. Each neighbor-
hood has its own unique characteristics.
Adams-Morgan
Adams-Morgan is jammed with restaurants, clubs, and interesting 
shops — and with people trying to get into them. The heart of this ethni-
cally diverse neighborhood beats at 18th Street NW and Columbia Road.
Take Metrorail to the Woodley Park-Zoo-Adams-Morgan Station, walk
south 1 long block on Connecticut Avenue, left 5 long blocks on Calvert
Street, and then bear right a half block to 18th and Columbia. In evenings
and on weekends, you can take the no. 98 Metrobus from the station to
Calvert and Columbia. It runs from 5:59 p.m. to 3:15 a.m. weeknights,
from 9:50 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. Saturdays, and from 6:05 p.m. to 12:15 a.m.
Sundays. After dark, it’s best to take the bus or a taxi.
You can enjoy a number of secondhand and one-of-a-kind stores here
selling clothing, antiques, foodstuffs, and other items. On Saturday, you
can find a farmers’ market at 18th Street and Columbia. Check out a
haunt of decorators and do-it-yourselfers at The Brass Knob (2311 18th
St. NW; % 202-332-3370), for architectural acquisitions recovered from
demolished houses and office buildings.
When you enter a Metrorail station to begin your trip, get a transfer
ticket from the machine on the mezzanine level. Hand the bus driver the
transfer and 35¢.
Carry exact fare; the drivers don’t make change. You don’t get a dis-
count when you transfer from bus to train. Transfers between buses are
free within a two-hour period.
Connecticut Avenue/Dupont Circle
The shopping on Connecticut Avenue changes flavor as you walk north
from the Farragut North Metrorail Station at K Street to the Dupont
Circle Metrorail Station and beyond. Between K and M streets, where
many lawyers and lobbyists ply their not-unrelated trades, you can
browse such traditional clothiers as Brooks Brothers (1201 Connecticut
Ave.; % 202-659-4650); Talbot’s (1122 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-887-6973);
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
230

and Burberry’s (1155 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-463-3000). Clothing bar-
gain hunters will like Filene’s Basement (1133 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-
872-8430). Women who need a little something to wear to a black-tie
affair at the White House shop at Rizik’s (1100 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-
223-4050), which has been offering designer garments and excellent
service since 1908.
As you get closer to Dupont Circle, shoppers and shopkeepers are less
likely to be wearing suits and carrying briefcases and more likely to be
outfitted in jeans and unnatural hair colors. Check out the galleries,
booksellers, secondhand stores, and specialty boutiques in this lively
neighborhood, which is one of Washington’s major entertainment cen-
ters, home to many nonprofit organizations, and the heart of D.C.’s gay
community. Try Kramerbooks & Afterwords for books, food, and drink
into the wee hours (1517 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-387-1400). The staff
at Beadazzled (1507 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-265-2323) can help you
make a necklace from a large selection of beads. In search of a kimono
and fan? Look no further than Ginza (1721 Connecticut Ave.; % 202-
331-7991). Lambda Rising (1625 Connecticut Ave.; 202-462-6969) is
D.C.’s leading gay/lesbian-oriented bookstore. The Human Rights
Campaign, America’s largest gay rights political action organization,
runs a store at 1629 Connecticut Ave. (% 202-232-8621).
Georgetown
Many art galleries, antiques stores, and specialty shops help make
Georgetown one of Washington’s liveliest neighborhoods from morning
until after midnight. This community is truly diverse, sporting some of
the city’s most expensive residences, Georgetown University, and its stu-
dent rooming houses. Folks from all walks of life stroll the commercial
blocks defined by M Street NW, Wisconsin Avenue, and nearby side
streets. You see old women with blue hair and young women with 
blue hair — just different tints. Walk from the Foggy Bottom–George
Washington University Metrorail Station, or take a 30-series Metrobus,
Circulator bus, or Georgetown Connection shuttle. You’ll recognize the
major national chain stores when you walk past them, so let me concen-
trate on some others — local, or at least unusual.
 Movie Madness (1083 Thomas Jefferson St.; % 202-337-7064) sells
movie posters.
 Commander Salamander (1420 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-337-2265)
sells punkish clothing, colored wigs, and off-the-wall gifts. This
store is popular with teens.
 The Phoenix (1514 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-338-4404) has been sell-
ing Mexican folk art and bric-a-bracs, handcrafted silver jewelry,
and those peasant blouses once favored by Joan Baez since 1955.
 For some comic relief — and more — check out Beyond Comics
(1419 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-333-8650) for comic books and the
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 231

toys, dolls, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia that the comic charac-
ters spawn.
 Up Against the Wall (3219 M St.; % 202-337-9316) sells trendy
clothes for teens and young adults.
 Shake Your Booty (3225 M St.; % 202-333-6524) supplies boots —
and shoes — to folks inclined to shake their thing.
 Lush (3066 M St. NW; % 202-333-6950), popular in Great Britain,
opened one of its first U.S. stores here to sell fresh-made bath
bombs, soaps, and other natural beauty products.
 H&M (3222 M St. NW; % 202-298-6792), from Sweden, a hip inter-
national chain store, offers trendy, inexpensive clothing for the
whole family.
 Old Print Gallery (1220 31st St. NW; % 202-965-1818) offers the
area’s largest selection of antique prints and maps.
 K Baby (3112 M St. NW; % 202-333-3939) targets babies — 
and their mommies who crave high-end clothing and nursery
accessories.
 Sugar (1633 Wisconsin Ave. NW; % 202-333-5331) boutique
attracts celebrities in search of hot designers’ clothes plus jewelry
made by local designers.
 Appalachian Spring (1415 Wisconsin Ave. NW; 202-337-5780) car-
ries a wide selection of American crafts made of wood, glass, and
fiber.
 If you suffer mall withdrawal, you can find a slew of upscale
national chains at Georgetown Park (3222 M St.; % 202-342-2688).
Union Station
A magnificent railway terminal, Union Station (50 Massachusetts Ave.
NE; % 202-289-1908; www.unionstationdc.com; Metro: Union Station)
serves Washington in multiple ways — train station, Metrorail station,
intercity bus depot, tour bus departure point, taxi stand, fast-food court,
full-service restaurant station, and super shopping destination. National
chains are well represented here. But you also encounter some unique
shops as well.
The most interesting spot here is the East Hall Gallery. The gallery’s
central open area contains small stands that sell a variety of jewelry,
arts, and crafts. Encircling the open area are stores, one of which,
Appalachian Spring (% 202-682-0505), is a favorite of my family. My
daughter acquired a wonderful monkey puppet (whom she named
“Fred”) here when she was young. Each time we return, we check to
assure ourselves that Fred’s younger relatives do, indeed, still hang out
here. The quilt on Susan’s and my bed comes from the Appalachian
Spring Georgetown store, the first, which opened in 1964. Originally,
Appalachian Spring dealt exclusively in arts and crafts from the
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
232

Appalachian Mountains. Now it carries original works from throughout
the United States.
Right outside the East Hall is a coin shop operated by the U.S. Mint
(% 202-289-0609). Elsewhere in the station are a cigar shop that goes
by the moniker President Cigars (% 202-289-2559) and a Discovery
Channel Store (% 202-842-3700), run by the TV/Internet empire that’s
headquartered in Washington’s Maryland suburbs.
If you get hungry here, you’ll have no trouble finding something to eat.
Several full-service restaurants are scattered around the station. (See
Chapter 10 for B. Smith’s.) The lower-level food court is enormous and
offers a wide variety of cuisines.
Upper Wisconsin Avenue
Just outside the Friendship Heights Metrorail Station is what I call
Washington’s Rodeo Drive. A few blocks of Wisconsin Avenue, on both
sides of the Washington-Maryland border, provide retail space for some
of the best-known names in up-up-up-scale shopping. (I happen to live
near here, so I’ll tell you about the downscale stores — where I shop —
as well.)
If Tiffany and friends appeal to you, gather up your titanium credit cards
and follow me. I’ve already mentioned Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks’s men’s
store, Neiman Marcus, and Lord & Taylor. Also ready to sell you expen-
sive goods in this neighborhood are Saks Jandel (5510 Wisconsin Ave.;
% 301-652-2250); Tiffany & Co. (5481 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-657-8777);
Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche (5510 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-656-8868);
Ralph Lauren (5471 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-718-4223); Barney’s New
York (5471 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-634-4061); Max Mara (5471 Wiscon-
sin Ave.; % 301-656-0581); Louis Vuitton (5555 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-
656-2191); Cartier (5471 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-654-5858); Jimmy
Choo (5481 Wisconsin Ave.; % 240-223-1102); Gucci (5481 Wisconsin
Ave.; % 301-986-8902); and Bulgari (5481 Wisconsin Ave.; % 301-966-
8610).
Now, just so you don’t get the wrong idea about my neighborhood, let
me tell you that you can have an eclectic shopping experience here if
you want it. Neiman’s and Saks’s men’s stores are major anchors of the
Mazza Gallerie (5300 Wisconsin Ave.) shopping mall. So is discounter
Filene’s Basement (% 202-966-0208). Across Jenifer Street from Mazza
and across 44th Street from Lord & Taylor sits another discounter, T.J.
Maxx (% 202-237-7616). Across Wisconsin from Mazza is another
indoor mall, Chevy Chase Pavilion. Next door is Loehmann’s (5333
Wisconsin Ave. NW; % 202-362-4733), an off-price mecca since the first
store opened in Brooklyn in 1921. New merchandise, including a small
amount for men, appears regularly, and women flock to the famous Back
Room for their favorite designers’ clothes at 30 percent to 65 percent off
regular retail.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 233

The easiest way to get to the area is to take Metrorail to the Friendship
Heights Station and follow the signs to the Western Avenue exits. After
you go through the Metro gate and up the escalator, you find yourself in
a sort of rotunda, with four exits to choose from. The hard left takes you
to the Western Avenue and 44th Street exit and Mazza Gallerie. The soft
left takes you to the Wisconsin and Western avenues exit, from where
you can walk up Wisconsin toward the upscale stores in Maryland.
Straight ahead is the Western Avenue and Military Road exit, which
takes you toward Clyde’s restaurant and the new Collection of Chevy
Chase shopping area where some of the upscale stores are located. The
doors to your right take you right into Chevy Chase Pavilion.
This neighborhood presents you with numerous dining options. See
reviews of Clyde’s, Booeymonger, and Chipotle in Chapter 10. You can
get good, huge meals at the Cheesecake Factory (5335 Wisconsin Ave.;
% 202-364-0500) in the Pavilion, but you may have to wait at meal times
because they don’t take reservations. At Maggiano’s Little Italy (5333
Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-966-5500), they take reservations but don’t seem
to know what they’re for; you can make a reservation, show up on time,
and still have to wait. What really irks me, in addition to that, is that while
they think nothing of keeping you waiting, they won’t seat you until your
entire party has arrived, even if you’re only one short. Another Italian
option is Lia’s (4445 Willard Ave., just west of Wisconsin, 1 block north
of Western; % 240-223-5427). Yet another is Famoso (5471 Wisconsin
Ave.; % 301-986-8785), in the Collection of Chevy Chase shopping area.
In the front end of Maggiano’s, the Corner Bakery (% 202-237-2200)
serves sandwiches, salads, and pastas. Chadwick’s (5247 Wisconsin; 
% 202-362-8040) is a neighborhood hangout; I find the burgers, salads,
and crab cakes to be best. Bambule (5225 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-966-
0300) serves tapas and has comfortable lounge seating and outdoor
dining in good weather. Cosi (5252 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-537-9000)
sells soups, salads, and sandwiches, as does Panera (4459 Willard Ave.;
% 301-951-5858) near Lia’s. Fancier and more expensive is the French/
Mediterranean restaurant Matisse (4934 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-244-
5222). The best way to enjoy the wonderful Indian food at Indique
Heights (2 Wisconsin Circle, above the bus terminal at the Western-
Wisconsin intersection; % 301-656-4822) is to order from the small-
plates menu. Also on the circle are Potomac Pizza (19 Wisconsin Circle;
% 301-951-1127) and Gifford’s Ice Cream (21 Wisconsin Circle; 
% 301-652-8965).
For a look at a real Friendship Heights neighborhood institution, walk
south on Wisconsin Avenue to Garrison Street and check out Rodman’s
(5100 Wisconsin Ave.; % 202-363-3466). It’s sort of a 21st-century gen-
eral store. Someone from our house comes here nearly every day — to
buy milk or bread or wine or toothpaste or bath beads or toilet paper or
a kitchen gadget or a birthday card or to get a watch repaired or to pick
up a prescription. This place is, after all, a pharmacy . . . and an interna-
tional food emporium and an electronics shop. Okay, you get the picture.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
234

(And you can get film and developing services, including digital prints.)
If you need something that fits on a shelf, you just may find it here. If
you’re here at the right time, you may catch Roy Rodman roaming the
aisles, negotiating a deal with a wholesaler on his portable phone. I was
here once, after a blizzard, when grocers around town were running out
of basics, and I noticed with surprise that Rodman’s had lots of milk. I
commented on this irony to a clerk, who told me that a milk truck had
broken down in front of the store the day before, and Mr. Rodman had
negotiated to buy the whole load.
Shopping for Specialties in D.C.
Are you looking to buy a specific product rather than to browse a shop-
ping area? Check this section to find what you’re looking for.
Bookstores
Washington is a literary town, so you can buy books in lots of places.
Here’s a sampling:
 It’s off the beaten tourist path, but Politics and Prose (5015 Con-
necticut Ave. NW; % 202-364-1919) is a wonderful bookstore. It’s a
neighborhood institution in a neighborhood that happens to have
lots of writers. So, beyond the books for sale, something is always
going on here. C-SPAN is taping a writer who’s reading from or talk-
ing about his book. An author is signing books or celebrating a new
publication. (The coming-out party for the first book Susan and I
wrote was here.) You may bump into George Will or Tim Russert
while browsing in the current affairs section. A funky coffee house
is in the lower level. Take an L-series Metrobus from Dupont Circle
or catch a cab.
 Before it became a universal requirement that bookstores house
cafes, Kramerbooks & Afterwords (1517 Connecticut Ave. NW; 
% 202-387-1400) was serving up food, drink, and live music with
its printed products. I’m talking full bar, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
and late supper. This place is open from 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily,
and around the clock from Friday morning until 1 a.m. Monday.
Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday, including all night. Did I
mention that they sell books?
 Olsson’s Books & Records is Washington’s local bookstore chain,
with two shops in the city and others in the suburbs, including one
at Reagan National Airport (% 703-417-1087). The stores survive
in an era dominated by national chains by focusing on their com-
munities. Each store’s manager stocks reading matter and music
that he knows his clientele is most interested in. You’ll find more
theater, film, and music at the location that’s next door to the
Shakespeare Theater in the Penn Quarter arts and entertainment
district (418 7th St. NW; % 202-638-7610 for books, 202-638-7613
for music), and more ecology and politics for the activists who
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 235

work around Dupont Circle at that branch (1307 19th St. NW; 
% 202-785-1133 for books, 202-785-2662 for music).
 Bargain hunters and collectors browse the shelves of Second Story
Books by Dupont Circle (2000 P St. NW; % 202-659-8884). It’s
Washington’s premier used and rare books store and also has two
locations in the suburbs. Proprietor Allan Stypeck is a host of “The
Book Guys” nationally syndicated radio show. Together, the three
stores have more than a million books, manuscripts, maps, prints,
paintings, and vintage posters.
 You can get your Borders Books & Music fix downtown at 600 
14th St. NW (% 202-737-1385) and 1801 L St. NW (% 202-466-4999),
in Upper Northwest’s Friendship Heights shopping area (5333
Wisconsin Ave. NW; % 202-686-8270), and at National Airport 
(% 703-416-1590).
 Barnes & Noble stores are downtown (555 12th St. NW; % 202-347-
0176) and in Georgetown (3040 M St. NW; % 202-965-9880).
 There’s a B. Dalton in Union Station (% 202-289-1724).
Cameras
If you need to get a camera repaired, want to buy some photographic
equipment, or need expert advice on the best film for what you plan to
shoot (if you’re among the dwindling crowd that still uses film), here are
two reputable companies that buy, sell, and repair equipment and sell
and process film.
 Penn Camera is at 1015 18th St. NW (% 202-785-7366).
 I’ve bought a camera, other equipment, and film — and sought
advice — from Pro Photo (1902 I St. NW; % 202-223-1292). I was
referred there in the first place by a professional photographer.
Music and Gifts
So what you really want is music for your ears? Olsson’s, Borders, and
Barnes & Noble sell music as well as books. See the previous section for
details.
A really unusual and interesting spot to look for unique gifts is Pangea
Artisan Market and Cafe (2121 Pennsylvania Ave. NW; % 202-872-6432).
It’s run by the World Bank to support artisans in developing countries.
You’ll find high-quality handbags, jewelry, table settings, and other
crafts. You also can learn about the people who make them. And, yes,
you can eat at the cafe.
Bibliophiles, music lovers, and collectors shouldn’t overlook the
museum and gallery stores.

Following an Itinerary:
Three Great Options
In This Chapter
 Planning a three-day exploration
 Getting a fix on the government
 Having fun in Washington with kids
S
o many sights, so little time! Is that your problem? Allow me to 
help with some suggested itineraries for seeing the top Washington
sights in just three days, for seeing government in action, and for explor-
ing D.C. with kids.
Refer to Chapter 10 for restaurant reviews and Chapter 11 for details
about the top sites.
Exploring Washington in Three Days
Direct from the Rectangular Office (sorry, mine’s not oval), here is a
three-day agenda for visiting the cream of Washington’s top sights and
getting a taste of the city.
As of this writing, the White House is not open for tours by the general
public. If it does reopen — or if you’re in a group that qualifies for a 
tour — you’ll want to put it on your itinerary, too. Call % 202-456-7041
or check www.whitehouse.gov/history/tours for information and
updates.
Save your Washington time for touring — not for standing in line — by
buying advance tickets to the Washington Monument and the Holocaust
Museum.
Day one
Start your Washington touring by getting an overview on the Tourmobile.
Get on board at the stop closest to your hotel (drivers sell tickets) or 
at Union Station. Ride the whole route, taking in the sights from the

comfort of your seat. Then continue on the Tourmobile to the Smith-
sonian Institution museum on the National Mall that interests you
most. (Depending on where you first boarded the Tourmobile, you may
save time by getting off across the Mall from your museum destination
rather than riding all the way to the museum’s door.) Spend some time
at that museum and have lunch there or at a nearby museum on the
Mall.
In the afternoon, take the Tourmobile to Arlington National Cemetery
and transfer to Tourmobile’s Arlington tour. Get off at each of the stops
to visit the Kennedy gravesites, witness the changing of the guard at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, and explore Arlington House.
Have dinner in Georgetown. After dinner, stroll M Street and Wisconsin
Avenue to absorb the Georgetown nightlife. Treat yourself to an ice
cream cone at Dolcezza Argentine Gelato Cafe or Thomas Sweet.
Day two
If the Supreme Court is hearing arguments today, get in line on the court
plaza before 10 a.m. and take a look. One line lets you take a quick peek;
the other enables you to see the entire hour-long performance. Whether
or not you take in an argument, plan on touring the Court, the Capitol,
and the Library of Congress.
Before you leave home, contact your representative or a senator for 
tickets to the special congressional tours conducted in each of these
buildings.
Act like an insider and grab lunch in a congressional cafeteria. Enter
any House or Senate office building and ask a guard for directions.
When you’re done on Capitol Hill, if you have time, visit another museum
on the Mall or the American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery
in the Old Patent Office Building. Then return to the Hill for a quick, inex-
pensive dinner in Union Station’s spacious lower-level food court or at
one of the informal restaurants that are scattered around the building.
Afterward, take Gray Line’s three-hour Washington After Dark Tour,
which leaves from the bus line’s terminal in the station.
Day three
Use your advance tickets for a morning visit to the Holocaust Museum
and a late afternoon ride to the top of the Washington Monument. In
between, try to squeeze in some time at the National Gallery of Art,
where the Cascade Cafe inside or the Pavilion Cafe in the Sculpture
Garden are good places for lunch. After you leave the Washington
Monument, stroll down the Mall to take in the memorials to those who
fought in World War II, Vietnam, and Korea, as well as the Lincoln
Memorial.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
240

If fine dining interests you and you don’t mind paying for it, eat at
Kinkead’s, one of Washington’s very best restaurants and one of my
favorites. Otherwise, check out the reviews for the $ and $$ restaurants
in Chapter 10. In warm weather, cap off your D.C. visit by having a drink
with a view on the Sky Terrace at the top of the Hotel Washington.
Washington for Government Groupies
Many put their faith in oysters and chocolate, but Henry Kissinger
declared that — based on personal experience — power is the greatest
aphrodisiac. Should you agree with Henry — the former secretary of
state, national security adviser, and all-around powerful person — join
the government groupie patrol at the following sights. (Even if you’re not
a government groupie or a political junkie, you may want to tag along
just to see where all those tax dollars of yours go.)
Contact your U.S. representative or one of your senators far in advance
of your visit to Washington. Ask him or her for VIP touring tickets and
for a pass to the visitors galleries in the House and/or Senate cham-
bers. Also ask about stopping by to see the office — or all three of 
them — while you’re in town.
Government Groupie Morning is much like Day Two of the three-day
tour. If the Supreme Court is hearing arguments today, get in line on the
court plaza before 10 a.m. As a government groupie, you’ll want to wit-
ness the entire hour-long event. When you’re not in the courtroom, tour
the Court, the Capitol, and the Library of Congress. If they’re in session,
stop by the chambers to watch Congress at work.
You’ll definitely want to have lunch in a government cafeteria. Ask a
guard in any House or Senate office building for directions. If you feel
more judicial than legislative, eat in the Supreme Court cafeteria.
Post-9/11 security has wreaked havoc on Government Groupie Day by
severely restricting tours of the White House and the Pentagon. To get
into the White House as I write this book, you have to be in a group of at
least ten people and make reservations through a member of Congress.
The Pentagon also is restricted to certain groups. Check the White
House status at % 202-456-7041 or www.whitehouse.gov/history/
tours or the Pentagon at % 703-697-1776 or pentagon.afis.osd.mil.
If you can’t get into the president’s mansion, you can stop by the White
House Visitor Center — which is at 1450 Pennsylvania Ave. NW — and
then take a stroll over to 1600 Pennsylvania and gaze longingly through
the fence.
Now, head back to the Hill and grab a drink at Bullfeathers (410 1st St.
SE at D Street), a popular hangout for House staffers, or the Dubliner
(520 North Capitol St. NW at F Street), which draws folks from the Senate
side. For dinner, drop some bucks at one of these government groupie
gathering places:
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Three Great Options 241

 The Monocle, a dining spot for senators, Senate staffers, the occa-
sional Supreme Court justice, and others who have business on the
Senate side of Capitol Hill.
 The Palm, where you may run into Larry King or James Carville or
at least see their caricatures on the wall.
Touring Washington Family Style
Don’t despair if the grandparents change their minds about staying with
the children so that you can enjoy a nice, relaxing adult vacation. Bring
the younger generation along! Washington is a very kid-friendly place.
Just take lots of breaks and carry snacks.
With kids younger than eight . . .
Go directly to the National Zoo. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. 
Go to the zoo. Pick up a map and schedule of events at the Education
Building near the Connecticut Avenue entrance when you arrive.
Children particularly enjoy watching the animals being fed and the
training sessions. The more active the animals, the more enthralled the
kids will be. That makes the seals and the monkeys good bets. Check
out the Orangutan Transportation System, to see whether any apes are
using their high-strung cable to swing from building to building right
over your head. Small kids sometimes find it easier to identify with the
small animals in the Small Mammal House. Children also seem to have a
strange fascination with the lizards and snakes at the Reptile Discovery
Center. Exclusively for kids are the Kids Farm, where they can groom
animals and engage in other hands-on activities, and the Prairie Play-
land, which kids three to eight can crawl through. Everyone, of course,
loves the pandas.
If you don’t spend the entire day at the zoo (It can happen!), head 
for the National Mall and the old-fashioned carousel in front of the
Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building. Other kid-friendly happen-
ings on the Mall include:
 The Insect Zoo and Dinosaur Hall in the Museum of Natural
History
 Just about any of the airplanes and space vehicles in the Air and
Space Museum
 The sculpture gardens outside the National Gallery and the
Hirshhorn Museum
In addition, not far from the Mall is the National Aquarium, where chil-
dren can pet a horseshoe crab in the touch tank.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
242

With kids eight and older . . .
The National Zoo and the Air and Space Museum work for kids of all
ages (including me!). So do the IMAX Theatre presentations in Air and
Space and the Natural History museums. Buy a kite in Air and Space
and fly it on the Mall — a long-standing tradition. These older kids also
like the Bureau of Engraving and Printing tour.
The beauty of Washington for families is that it’s hard to have an interest
that isn’t represented in the city somewhere. Ask your youngsters what
they’re interested in, and you should be able to find a museum — or at
least a museum section — that’s dedicated to the subject. Washington
also has sports, music, movies, and pizza.
With teens . . .
Touring Washington with teens is easy (knock on wood). At the very
least, they’ll be interested in the places they’ve read about in their his-
tory classes.
To be a bit more specific: The gadgets and pop culture references at the
International Spy Museum are especially attractive to teens. Lots of
teens enjoy people-watching, and the sidewalks of Georgetown teem
with watchable people. Lots of Georgetown shops cater to the teen and
young-adult crowd as well. Let them explore the enormous variety of
eatables at the Union Station food court.
To avoid feeling like you’re dragging your teens around the city, ask
them to thumb through this book, especially Chapter 11, and let them
take the lead in planning some of your family’s activities. See Chapter 11
for specific ideas.

Going Beyond Washington:
Three Great Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Visiting Old Town in Alexandria, Virginia
 Exploring Annapolis, Maryland
 Taking a trip to Baltimore
P
oliticians work their butts off to get elected so they can come to
Washington. Then they spend as little time here as possible —
heading back home for as many Fridays through Mondays as they can,
so they can maximize their time with their constituents and be reelected
to come back. You can play that game, too, getting out of Washington for
a day — even overnight — to check out some nearby attractions. This
chapter describes three destinations within an hour or less of the White
House (in case that’s where you stay).
Day Trip #1: Discovering Old 
Town in Alexandria, Virginia
Like Georgetown, Alexandria was a bustling river port before anyone
had even dreamed of a District of Columbia — or of a United States for
D.C. to be the capital of. When the time came to plan for revolution,
George Washington and other Founding Fathers did some important
planning in what is now called Alexandria’s Old Town, which is where
you’ll want to spend your time. The river and 18th-century buildings are
still here to put you in touch with Alexandria’s history. There are both
inexpensive and fine-dining restaurants, along with countless shops sell-
ing a wide variety of goods. The waterfront is still active, though prima-
rily with pleasure craft. The local economy now bustles with overflow
from the capital city up the river, tourism, and a rather large artists’
colony operating in an old military weapons plant. In February, locals
and visitors unpack their powdered wigs for the giant Washington’s
Birthday Parade.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 245

Getting to Old Town
If you drive to Old Town, go west on Independence Avenue. As you
approach the Lincoln Memorial, watch closely for signs to Arlington
Memorial Bridge. After you cross the bridge, turn right out of the traffic
circle and then exit left, following the signs to National Airport. After you
pass the airport, the parkway becomes Washington Street in Alexandria.
The heart of Old Town is along King Street, both left and right of Wash-
ington Street.
Thumbs down on driving here in rush hour, when the 8 miles from D.C.
may feel more like 80. And be warned that traffic almost always creeps
on Old Town’s narrow streets, and finding parking is a hassle, especially
on weekends.
Out-of-town visitors can get free 24-hour parking permits at the Ramsay
House Visitors Center (221 King St., east of Fairfax Street; % 800-388-9119
or 703-838-5005; www.funside.com). Park your car at a two-hour meter
and put in some change. At the visitor center, give your license plate
number and show identification that proves you’re from out of the area.
Then put the pass in your car. You can renew it once. Old Town has
about 20 parking lots and garages.
If you’re coming for the day and don’t have luggage in tow, Metrorail is a
better transportation bet. Take the Yellow Line train toward Huntington
or a Blue Line toward Franconia-Springfield. Get off at the King Street
Station. You’re now at the western edge of Old Town. You can start
strolling east on King to explore everything Old Town has to offer. (The
first couple blocks don’t look like much, but you’ll soon start using
words like quaint and charming to describe what you’re seeing.) Or you
can catch a DASH bus (% 703-370-3274; www.dashbus.com) at the
Metrorail Station. The 2, 5, and 7 buses travel from the station to near
the eastern end of King Street. Fare’s a buck — or 35¢ with a Metrorail
transfer; up to two kids age four and younger ride free with an adult. The
Dash About shuttle takes passengers for free between the Metro station
and the visitors center Friday 7 p.m. to midnight, Saturday 10 a.m. to
midnight, and Sunday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Taking a tour
Alexandria offers so many tours they bump into each other as they
move around town. The Ghost and Graveyard Tour seems to be the
most popular, but I like the Horse-Drawn Carriage Ride better.
A guide wearing 18th-century clothes and carrying a lantern leads
Alexandria Colonial Tours’ Ghost and Graveyard Tour (% 703-519-
1749; www.alexcolonialtours.com), which, of course, takes place at
night. A guide leads the group through Old Town’s old streets, with
patter that’s a mixture of real cultural history and old-time stories. The
stories describe Alexandria residents who supposedly died in some
unfortunate way that caused them to return to haunt the living. The
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
246

group is “abandoned” in a graveyard, but it’s not too hard to find your
way out. The one-hour tour starts from the Ramsay House Visitors
Center, 221 King St. (east of Fairfax Street), at 7:30 and 9 p.m. Friday and
Saturday, and 7:30 p.m. Sunday from mid-March to mid-November,
weather permitting. During June to November, tours also are scheduled
on Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $8 for tourists 13
and older, $6 for military personnel, $5 for children ages 7 to 12, and free
for those younger than 7.
Another fun way to see Old Town is in a horse-drawn carriage. Olde
Towne Horse and Carriage (% 703-765-8976) offers rides Wednesday
through Sunday except when it’s raining, snowing, above 90 degrees or
below 40. You’ll clip-clop slowly through Old Town’s quieter back streets.
It’s a quiet, relaxing excursion. You have to call ahead for reservations.
Tickets cost $10 per person for a 15- to 20-minute ride. For $75, you can
rent the whole carriage to take up to six people on a one-hour ride.
As a river city, Alexandria also offers a number of boat tours from the
marina at Cameron and Union streets.
With the Potomac Riverboat Company (% 877-511-2628, 703-548-9000;
www.potomacriverboatco.com), you can cruise to, tour, and return
from George Washington’s Mount Vernon home; see Washington’s monu-
ments from the water; or take a water taxi trip between Alexandria and
31st Street NW in Georgetown. Prices range from $11 to $32, $11 to $30
for seniors 60 and older, and $7 to $19 for children. Boats run on varied
schedules from April through October.
Seeing the sights
Write, call, or stop at the Ramsay House Visitors Center (221 King St.,
east of Fairfax Street; % 800-388-9199 or 703-838-5005; www.funside.
com), a replica of the early-18th-century house built by William Ramsay,
a Scottish merchant and a founder of Alexandria. The center provides
brochures, maps, and a special events calendar. Pick up the free Official
Visitors Guide, which contains, among other things, directions for an
Old Town walking tour. You also can purchase admission tickets for
many historic homes and sights. Ramsay House is open daily from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., except Thanksgiving, December 25, and January 1.
If you plan to visit historic Gadsby’s Tavern, Carlyle House, and Lee-
Fendall House, you can save a bit by buying the Tricorn Ticket, which
gets you into all three places for $9 for adults and $5 for children 11 to 17.
The two buildings that comprise Gadsby’s Tavern (134 N. Royal St.,
south of Cameron Street; % 703-838-4242; www.gadsbystavern.org)
were constructed in 1785 and 1792 and were operated by John Gadsby
from 1796 to 1808. Many Revolutionary leaders slept, ate, met, and were
entertained here — including George and Martha Washington, John
Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and the Marquis de Lafayette.
The buildings and furnishings have been restored to their 18th-century
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 247

appearance. Guided tours are conducted a quarter before and past each
hour: April through October Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sunday and Monday from 1 to 5 p.m.; November through March
Wednesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 1 to 
4 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving, December 25, and January 1. Tours cost 
$4 for adults, $2 for children 11 to 17, free for younger children who are
with a paying adult. The tavern is still functioning, so you can eat here
daily from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m., or take Sunday Brunch
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Come for the atmosphere rather than expecting
gourmet cooking. The ham and crab in puff pastry is pretty good.
We heard a fascinating and thorough recounting of the history and archi-
tecture of the Carlyle House (121 N. Fairfax St., south of Cameron Street;
% 703-549-2997; www.carlylehouse.org) during a 45-minute tour of
this impressive 18th-century mansion. It was built of stone in 1752 by
John Carlyle, a Scottish merchant and another founder of the city. It is
said that the home’s Colonial Georgian architecture is patterned on a
Scottish country house. British Gen. Edward Braddock set up headquar-
ters here for a while during the French and Indian War, and five colonial
governors met here to plan the campaign against the French and Indians
along the Ohio River. You can take a break from touring by relaxing in
the gardens out back. Tours are conducted on the hour and half hour
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday noon to 
4 p.m. Tickets cost $4 for adults, $2 for children ages 11 to 17, and free
for younger kids.
Historical figures from the 18th to the 20th centuries owned the prop-
erty on which the Lee-Fendall House (614 Oronoco St., east of N. Wash-
ington Street; % 703-548-1789; www.leefendallhouse.org) stands.
Gen. “Light Horse Harry” Lee — a Revolutionary War leader and the
father of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee — sold the lot for the house 
to his cousin Philip Richard Fendall in 1784. The last of the Lee family
moved out in 1903. In 1937, the house became the property of United
Mine Workers President John L. Lewis, one of the most important labor
leaders in U.S. history. Lewis lived here until his death in 1969. The
house is restored to its Victorian appearance when Lee family members
lived here during the 1850 to 1870 period. The house is open Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.
Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for students ages 11 to 17, and free for
younger children. Phone ahead if you plan a weekend visit because the
house sometimes closes for private functions.
Shopping in Old Town
Right after World War I and again during World War II, the Torpedo
Factory (105 N. Union St., at Cameron Street; % 703-838-4565; www.
torpedofactory.org) did manufacture torpedoes. Now, it’s an arts
center, with 82 working studios, six galleries, and more than 165 painters,
sculptors, weavers, and other artists who work in full view of the public.
Visitors are invited inside the artists’ studios to observe and make 
purchases. While you’re here, take a look at the unearthed artifacts on
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C.

display in the Alexandria Archaeology Museum (% 703-838-4399; oha.
ci.alexandria.va.us/archaeology), which occupies space in the
factory. The factory is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is
free. It’s also free to visit the museum, which is open Tuesday through
Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Both facilities are closed Easter, Thanksgiving,
July 4, December 25, and January 1.
Farmers have been displaying their produce in Alexandria’s Market
Square since the city was born. Today, the Farmers’ Market (301 King
St., between Royal and Fairfax streets) occupies the square in front of
City Hall from 5:30 to 10:30 a.m. every Saturday year-round. As befitting
a market in a 21st-century tourist area, the market offers arts and crafts,
as well as fruits, vegetables, and baked goods. It’s a great place to nibble
your breakfast while strolling around and looking at what’s for sale. Get
some coffee, some fresh-squeezed orange juice, and a couple of pastries.
You can find a place to sit on a wall or some steps if you have trouble
chewing and walking — and juggling several cups and bags — at the
same time.
I can’t begin to do justice to the multitude of shops that stretch from the
river to the King Street Metrorail Station. So I’ll just highlight a few of the
most interesting ones.
Ten Thousand Villages (915 King St.; % 703-684-1435; www.tenthousand
villages.com) is a unique shop that sells fair-trade crafts from around
the world — mostly from poorer countries or neighborhoods. The shop
is part of a global organization that pays the craftsmen or farmers
(coffee is sold here) a fair wage for their work, which is more than they
usually earn. But the prices remain attractive. Also importing folk arts
and crafts — most from Latin America — is Gossypia (325 Cameron St.;
% 703-836-6969; www.gossypia.com). Here you encounter decorative
items, rugs, pillows — and bridal dresses. Elder Crafters (405 Cameron
St.; % 703-683-4338) offers works by crafters older then 55. Some of you
might think that’s a bit early to be called “elder,” but AARP is out recruit-
ing 50-year-olds now, so there you go. You can find a wide range of prod-
ucts here, from the kind of simple crafts you run into at a church bazaar
to gorgeous quilts with price tags that flirt with $1,000. Much of the stuff
here is kid-oriented — clothes, toys, and the like. Arts Afire (1117 King
St.; % 703-838-9785; www.artsafire.com) sells primarily — but not
exclusively — American-made arts and crafts. It probably won’t surprise
you to learn that My Place in Tuscany (1127 King St.; 703-683-8882;
www.myplaceintuscany.com) sells brightly colored handmade ceram-
ics from Italy.
For real decadence, leap over to Barkley Square Gourmet Dog Bakery
& Boutique (1 Wales Alley; % 703-519-7565), which proffers exactly
what its name implies. Get your dog some gourmet biscuits, or some
fancy toys, or some exclusive clothing.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 249

If cooking’s your thing, drop in on La Cuisine (323 Cameron St.; 703-836-
4435). The foodies there sell cooking utensils, cookbooks, spices, oils,
and chef’s clothing. Misha’s Coffeehouse and Coffee Roaster (102 South
Patrick St.; 703-548-4089) roasts coffee (surprise!) on the premises 
and sells brewed coffee for consumption inside or on a bench on the
sidewalk.
A Likely Story (1555 King St.; % 703-836-2498; www.alikelystory
books.com) is a children’s bookstore, as well as a place to buy toys,
games, puzzles, stuffed animals, and other kid stuff. A really big religious
bookstore, Pauline Books and Media (% 703-549-3806), sits at 1025
King St.
The Christmas Attic (125 S. Union St.; % 703-548-2829; www.christmas
attic.com) is an enormous Christmas store, open year-round, that
became so big and successful it opened a second shop (107 N. Fairfax
St.; % 703-548-4267). The second shop is called House in the Country,
but you can find some pretty uncountrified things here. “Christmas” is
defined broadly enough there to encompass other holidays, evidenced
by their stock of scary Halloween accoutrements, among others.
Where to dine in Alexandria
One of the best places to dine in Alexandria is Vermilion (1120 King St.,
west of Henry Street; % 703-684-9669; www.vermilionrestaurant.com),
a warm and comfortable Modern American spot. Try to get a table by a
second floor window, where you can look down at the activity along King
Street while savoring the quiet, soft atmosphere inside. In keeping with
the name, most of the interior is done in shades of red — a red brick
wall, red fabric draped from the ceiling and along another wall. The floor
is a warm wood. Gas lights glow along the brick wall, and candles burn
on the tables. Start your meal by chewing on some of the superb French
bread while enjoying a generous serving of steamed mussels in a rich,
salty, buttery sauce. The baby spinach salad’s also good. For a main
course, opt for the tender, tasty pork chop if it’s on the changing menu.
Lots of revelers crowd into the downstairs bar, which has its own menu,
but it’s a bit too smoky for my nostrils. Main courses run from $17 to
$30. Vermilion is open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner is 5:30 to 
10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
Reservations are recommended.
For a break from Alexandria’s 18th- and 19th-century history, sample a
bite of 20th-century history at the Majestic Cafe (911 King St, between
Patrick and Alfred streets; % 703-837-9117; www.majesticcafe.com).
As you approach the Majestic, the Art Deco facade and the movie-
theater-like neon sign proclaim its movie-theater-like name. An earlier
Majestic Cafe fed Alexandrians a couple blocks away in the 1930s and
1940s, and at this site from 1949 to 1978. In 2001, the Majestic reopened
as a Modern American restaurant with strong Southern influences. It
quickly became one of Alexandria’s best dining sites. Just as this edition
of Washington, D.C. For Dummies was heading for the printer, the Majestic’s
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
250

management changed hands. But it should retain its high quality
because it’s going to be run by the folks who operate another one of
Alexandria’s top spots, Restaurant Eve. The menu was slated to include
traditional American dishes and home-style deserts. Main courses at
dinner are expected to cost between $15 and $22. Approximate operat-
ing hours are to be 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. daily for lunch, 5:30 to 10 p.m.
Sunday through Thursday for dinner, and until 11 p.m. Friday and
Saturday. Reservations are recommended.
The Hard Times Cafe (1404 King St., at West Street; % 703-837-0050;
www.hardtimes.com) earns a spot in my family’s heart because of the
bizarre focus of its menu — Texas and Cincinnati chili. When Susan and I
lived in Dayton, Cincinnati chili parlors were all around, and I developed
a fondness for the spicy stuff. For the uninitiated, Texas chili is made
with coarse-ground or chunked beef. Cincinnati chili, originally con-
cocted by Greek immigrants, uses fine-ground beef in a tomato sauce
with sweeter spices, including cinnamon. Adding to Cincinnati chili’s
uniqueness is the tradition of serving it with spaghetti, beans, onions,
and cheese (a “five-way”) — or any combination thereof. Keeping up
with the new times, the Hard Times folks now offer vegetarian chili. 
Hard Times opens at 11 a.m. daily and closes at 11 p.m. Sunday through
Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday. A bowl of chili costs $7,
more when you add those optional ingredients. Chili dogs cost $6.79.
Reservations are not accepted.
The Union Street Public House (121 S. Union St., between King and
Prince streets; % 703-548-1785; www.usphalexandria.com) has long
been a favorite for its casual, neighborhood saloon ambience, bar food,
and local beer. Old brickwork, gas lamps, and polished wood enhance
the pubby-clubby atmosphere. Dinner entrees — crab cakes, fish and
chips, lobster, ribs, and pasta — range from $10 to $25, with sandwiches
from $8 to $15. A kids’ menu is available. The restaurant is open Monday
through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday
from 11:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., with
Sunday brunch from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The bar stays open till 1:40 a.m.,
and serves a light menu until midnight Sunday through Thursday and 
1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Reservations accepted for parties of eight 
or more, except Friday and Saturday evenings.
Spending the night in Alexandria
The best-located hotel in Alexandria is the Old Town Hotel (480 King St.,
east of Pitt Street; % 800-368-5047 or 703-549-6080). This six-story, red
brick hotel stands a block from Market Square in the heart of Old Town.
The décor — from the lobby to the rooms — is replica colonial. Rooms
tend to be large. Some have balconies overlooking a courtyard. The
hotel offers a pool, exercise equipment, and the usual in-room amenities.
On-site parking costs $10 a night. There’s free shuttle service to National
Airport and the King Street Metrorail Station. Rack rates start at $249 for
a double. But deep discounts are available during off-peak times.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 251

Day Trip #2: Visiting Annapolis, Maryland
One more historic and lower key alternative to Washington is Annapolis,
another port since the 18th century. Annapolis remains a hub for mar-
itime businesses, pleasure boaters, and the U.S. Navy. This is the home
of the U.S. Naval Academy, as well as of St. John’s College, which is
noted for its unique Great-Books-based curriculum and its consistent
victories over the midshipmen in an annual croquet tournament.
Annapolis also serves as Maryland’s capital, so it’s not exactly a sleepy
town. But stroll among the historic buildings and sit for a while by the
water, and you’ll feel some serenity that’s harder to find in the big city.
A vocal and active preservation group oversees the historic district,
some think with an iron fist. But the efforts have paid off handsomely:
No high-rises, billboards, fast-food restaurants, or out-of-place modern
buildings interfere with the architectural integrity of downtown.
Getting there
Traveling to Annapolis is a rare time during your Washington visit when
a car comes in handy. The drive from downtown D.C. takes about an
hour. Leave Washington to the east via New York Avenue, which is U.S.
50, and follow 50 all the way. As you approach Annapolis, take Exit 24,
Rowe (rhymes with cow) Boulevard. From there, you can follow signs to
the visitor center, which is near two parking garages in the Historic
District.
Tune your radio to 1620 AM as you approach the city for warnings
about parking during special events.
On-street parking is a buck an hour from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. daily. After
two hours, you must move the car. You’ll find it a lot easier to park in a
garage or at the Navy-Marine Corps Stadium, which is off Rowe at Taylor
Avenue.
Stadium parking is $5 all day. A free shuttle to the visitor center, Historic
District, and City Dock leaves the stadium on the hour and half hour
from 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends.
Another shuttle runs more frequently to the visitor center and govern-
ment buildings. Shuttles don’t run on some holidays. Call % 410-263-
7964 for information.
The Gotts Court Garage, off Calvert or Northwest street by the visitor
center, is $1.25 to a maximum $10 on weekdays and $4 on weekends. Off
Main Street closer to the City Dock, the Hillman Garage charges $10
maximum every day and tends to fill earlier.
The local traffic agents are as vigilant as vultures awaiting fresh road kill.
You really don’t want to park in an illegal spot.

Dillon’s Bus Service (% 800-827-3490 or 410-647-2321; www.dillonbus.
com) operates limited service between D.C. and Annapolis for $4.25 one
way. Greyhound’s (% 800-229-9424; greyhound.com) limited service is
$16 one way, $31 round-trip.
Seeing the sights
Annapolis is a working state capital whose history stretches back more
than 300 years. More than 1,500 historic buildings are scattered among
the narrow brick streets and alleys. The city is almost always crowded
with people working, playing, sailing, eating, and studying.
To work out how you want to spend your time in Annapolis, write or call
the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Conference and Visitors
Bureau, 26 West St., Annapolis, MD 21401 (% 888-302-2852, 410-280-
0445), open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Thanksgiving, December 25,
and January 1, or surf over to www.visit-annapolis.org. Once you
arrive in town, you can get information from the bureau’s visitor center,
which is just off Church Circle. You also can pick up maps and literature
and ask questions at the visitor information booth next to the public
restrooms at the City Dock. It’s open the same hours from April to early
October, then limited hours on weekends through November.
Three Centuries Tours (% 410-268-7600) leads several different walking
itineraries of the Historic District, the Capitol, and the Naval Academy.
Discover Annapolis Tours (% 410-626-6000; www.discoverannapolis.
com) shuttles visitors through 350 years of history and architecture
aboard minibuses with big windows. The hour-long tour leaves from 
the Visitor Center at 26 West St., the 40-minute tour from History Quest
at 99 Main St. Call or check the Web site for departure times, which vary
according to the season. The hour-long tour costs $15 for adults, $7 for
ages 11 to 15, $3 for younger kids. The shorter tour costs $13, $6, and 
$3. This tour is good for persons with disabilities, those who can’t walk
long distances, and the terminally lazy. All others should get out there
and walk!
The Historic Annapolis Foundation (% 800-603-4020 or 410-297-6656;
www.annapolis.org) rents four different digital audio tours at 99 Main
St. The tours cover Annapolis highlights, Annapolis during the Revolu-
tion, Annapolis in the Civil War, and African-American Annapolis. You’ll
spend one to three hours on a tour. Call to find out when the recordings
are available.
Watermark Cruises (% 410-268-7600; www.watermarkcruises.com)
sails from the City Dock to view Annapolis Harbor, as well as the U.S.
Naval Academy and the banks of the Severn River. Go with the flow. The
40-minute narrated tour leaves every hour on the hour from noon to 
3 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends late March to mid-May;
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekends mid-
May to early September; and from noon to 4 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
254

to 6 p.m. weekends from early September to early October. Tours are
offered on an irregular basis afterwards. Cost is $10 for adults and $4 for
ages 3 to 11, free for younger kids. Cruises lasting 90 minutes are offered
at 12:30, 2:30, and 4:30 p.m. daily mid-May to early September, weekends
mid-April to mid-May and early September to early October. Call about
other offerings, such as an all-day cruise on the Chesapeake Bay.
You don’t need a guide to walk the length of City Dock to the water and
enjoy the panorama from Susan Campbell Memorial Park. Get a double-
scooper from Storm Brothers Ice Cream Factory (130 Dock St.; % 410-
263-3376) and drip across the street to the sea wall along Ego Alley,
appropriately named for the informal parade of boats and flesh that
takes place on summer weekends. Where Ego Alley dead-ends, across
from Market House, is a life-size bronze of Roots author Alex Haley
reading to several children. The sculpture commemorates the landing of
Haley’s ancestor, Kunta Kinte, aboard the slave ship Lord Ligonier in 1767.
Check out the architecture as you ascend Main Street from City Dock 
to Church Circle and the harbor view from the Maryland Inn (58 State
Circle; % 410-263-2641). Independently owned businesses are A.L.
Goodies General Store (112 Main St.; % 410-269-0071) for souvenirs, 
T-shirts, and fudge; Avoca Handweavers (141 Main St.; % 410-263-
1485) for woolens and household accessories from the British Isles; 
and Chick and Ruth’s Delly (165 Main; % 410-269-6737), an Annapolis
institution since the 1960s. (See the next section, “Where to dine,” for
more information.)
History buffs may want to detour to the Banneker-Douglass Museum
(84 Franklin St.; % 410-514-7618; www.bdmuseum.com), dedicated to
preserving Maryland’s African-American heritage; it’s named for
Benjamin Banneker, who helped survey and lay out the District of
Columbia, and Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery to become a
leader of the abolition movement. From the top of Main Street, go left at
Church Circle and then left at Franklin. The museum is housed in the old
Mount Moriah A.M.E. Church. The museum’s exhibits change periodi-
cally. Call ahead to find out about current shows. It’s open Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Saturday from noon to 4 p.m.
Admission is free.
If you go right onto Church Circle from Main Street and right again at
School Street to State Circle, you discover Annapolis as state capital.
The State House (% 410-974-3400), the oldest state capitol building in
continuous use, still watches over the town below. Construction began
in 1772, and the original section was completed in 1779. It served as the
U.S. Capitol from November 1783 to August 1784 when the Continental
Congress met in the Old Senate Chamber. View the grounds and public
areas on your own or take the free tour, daily at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. When
you exit the rear of the building, cross Lawyers Mall, with its statue of
Thurgood Marshall, to Government House, the official residence of
Maryland’s governor. Because the governor lives here, you can’t just
walk in to tour.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 255

On State Circle are some of the town’s premier shops and galleries.
Annapolis Pottery (no. 40; % 410-268-6153; www.annapolispottery.
com) is a workshop/gallery with a wide selection of attractive and func-
tional pieces. The Maryland Federation of Art Gallery (no. 18; % 410-
268-4566; www.mdfedart.org), in a restored 1840 building with exposed
brick and modern lighting, mounts solo and small group exhibits of multi-
media works and three national shows per year.
From State Circle, turn down Maryland Avenue, with its many home
design and antiques shops, boutiques, and galleries. Reminiscent of a
gentler era and a lot less touristy than Main Street, Maryland Avenue
merits exploration. Shops line the cobblestone street from State Circle
to Prince George Street. Stop in the Aurora Gallery (no. 67; % 410-
263-9150) a few doors from the State House, with its American-made
crafts, pottery, jewelry, paintings, and sculpture (some created by the
artist-owners). The Dawson Gallery (no. 44; % 410-269-1299) sells
18th-, 19th-, and early-20th-century American and European paintings.
Among the gallery’s better-known customers is Harrison Ford, who pur-
chased paintings here while filming Patriot Games in Annapolis.
Anyone who’s been in Annapolis five minutes knows it’s a sailing mecca.
Many people come here from all over the country to learn to sail. If you’re
one of them, try the Annapolis Sailing School (601 6th St.; % 800-638-
9192, 410-267-7205; www.annapolissailing.com), where I’m told you
can learn the basics in a weekend.
If you’re not going to take the helm yourself, feel the wind on your 
face aboard the 74-foot schooner Woodwind (% 410-263-7837; www.
schoonerwoodwind.com), which sails from 80 Compromise St. Several
cruises run at varying times daily mid-April through October. Call or
check the Web site for details. The two-hour cruise costs $31 to $34, $29
to $32 for seniors 60 and older, and $20 for kids younger than 12.
Annapolis lays claim to numerous fine examples of 18th- and 19th-
century architecture. As you tour, notice the colored plaques on many
buildings designating their historic status and the period in which they
were built. (An explanation is provided in the Annapolis Visitors Guide,
available at the visitor center.) Check out the William Paca House and
Garden (186 Prince George St.; % 410-267-7619; www.annapolis.org/
paca-house.html). Paca (pronounced Pay-ca) was a wealthy planter
who signed the Declaration of Independence. The Georgian mansion,
built between 1763 and 1765, nearly succumbed to the wrecker’s ball in
1965. The Historic Annapolis Foundation stepped in, restoring the house
and gardens to their former grandeur. Tours are offered once an hour on
the half hour Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday
from noon to 5 p.m. from late March through December, and Friday
through Sunday noon to 5 p.m. from late January to late March. It’s
closed Thanksgiving Day and December 25. Call or check the Web site
for details. Admission to the garden is $5. Garden plus house tour is $8,
seniors $7, children 6 to 17 $5, younger kids free.
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
256

Many people use the words “Annapolis” and “U.S. Naval Academy”
interchangeably. Whatever you call it, the academy is a must-see. If you
park downtown, it’s a five-minute walk from City Dock via Randall Street
to King George Street and Gate 1, the visitors’ entrance. Since September
11, 2001, tourists aren’t permitted to drive onto the academy grounds
(or “onboard,” as the sailors say). The exception is a vehicle with a
handicapped license plate or permit, which is allowed on campus through
Gate 1 after an inspection. To get information before you arrive, call 
% 410-263-6933 or visit the academy’s Web site for tourists at www.
navyonline.com.
At the Armel-Leftwich Visitor Center, just inside Gate 1, you can watch
the short film To Lead and to Serve, check out the interactive exhibits,
peruse the gift shop, and join a guided tour of the academy. The center
displays a sample midshipman’s room; Freedom 7, the space capsule in
which Navy Commander Alan Shepard became the first American to take
a suborbital flight into space; a howitzer gun; the original wooden figure-
head of the USS Delaware, and an exhibit on the life and times of John
Paul Jones, the Revolutionary War commander.
The center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. March through December
and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. January and February. It’s closed Thanksgiving,
December 25, and January 1. Tours cost $8, seniors 62 and older $7, 
elementary and secondary school students $6, preschoolers free. July
through August, the tours run from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, and 12:30 to 3 p.m. Sunday. From December through March,
they run Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Sunday
from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. April through June and September through
November, the tours run Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Sunday from 12:30 to 3 p.m.
During the academic year (Sept–May), try to hook up with a morning
tour that allows you to see noon meal formation in front of Bancroft Hall.
For information and tickets to athletic events, call the Naval Academy
Athletic Association (% 800-874-6289; www.navysports.cstv.com).
Where to dine
Café Normandie (185 Main St.; % 410-263-3382) is a cozy, plant-filled
French bistro. Come for a hearty breakfast on weekends (eggs, omelets,
and French toast). All week, it’s is a good place for lunch (tomato-crab or
onion soup, grilled chicken, or crepes), or dinner (shrimp, beef many
ways, seafood-filled crepes). The best desserts are ice-cream or fruit-
filled crepes. The restaurant is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
to 10:30 p.m., Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday from 8 a.m. 
to 10 p.m. Dinner main courses run from $13 to $28. Reservations are
recommended.
From May to October, visit Cantler’s Riverside Inn on Mill Creek (458
Forest Beach Rd.; % 410-757-1311; http://cantlers.com) and dig into
a pile of steamed fresh Maryland blue crabs. This place is packed in
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 257

summer, especially on weekends. The best strategy is to arrive at off
times. Have an early or late lunch or a very early dinner. Otherwise, you
may find the crabs AWOL. When the crabs are out of season, try the
steamed shrimp, and fried or broiled fish. The inn is about a 15-minute
ride from City Dock. Cantler’s opens daily at 11 a.m. and closes at mid-
night Friday and Saturday and 11 p.m. the rest of the week. Reservations
accepted only for parties of ten or more Monday through Thursday.
With its long wooden bar, chatty bartender, high-decibel noise level, and
garage-sale accessories, Riordan’s (26 Market Space; % 410-263-5449;
www.riordans.com) is a quintessential neighborhood saloon. The
servers are pleasant and efficient, the food is consistent and reasonably
priced, and the beer is cold. Start with cheddar-bacon potato skins or a
seafood appetizer and then move on to a burger or roast beef sandwich.
The soups are, um, super, especially the New England clam chowder and
crab vegetable. The à la carte Sunday brunch (mimosa or glass of cham-
pagne included) is an Annapolis tradition — and a bargain, with entrees
all less than $10. At lunch and dinner, a kids’ menu lists burgers, chicken
tenders, and pasta. Hours are Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to
1:30 a.m. and Sunday 10 to 1:30 a.m. Sandwiches and entrees run $8 to $15.
Chick and Ruth’s Delly (165 Main St.; % 410-269-6737; www.chickand
ruths.com) has anchored the corner of Main and Conduit streets since
the 1960s, before Annapolis became a yuppie outpost. Come for the
breakfast platters (served all day), the tasty sandwiches (named for
Maryland politicians and local characters), milkshakes, malts, or banana
splits. Try the delly fries (home fries with plenty of pepper and onions).
The kitschy décor — orange Formica countertops and bagel light-pulls
are décor? — is pure 1950s. So are the cheeky waitresses and the prices.
Except for the crabs, almost everything’s under $10. The Delly is open
Sunday through Thursday 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday
till 12:30 a.m.
Griffin’s (22–24 Market Space; % 410-268-2576; www.griffins-city
dock.com) feels like a pub, stocks a dozen or more draft beers, and
dishes out enormous portions. It serves up creative cooking, as well. 
On a recent visit, Susan, Julie, and I agreed that the portobello mush-
room sandwich was very good. The greens in a very good — and 
very interesting — salad were topped with coconut-breaded shrimp,
almonds, and dried cranberries. The fries came as they’re supposed 
to — crunchy on the outside, warm and soft in the middle. Sandwiches
range from $7.50 (burger) to $15 (crab cakes), and main courses are $12
(ribs) to $27 (steak). Griffin’s is open 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through
Saturday, 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday.
Spending the night in Annapolis
The Annapolis Marriott Waterfront (80 Compromise St.; % 888-773-0786
or 410-268-7555; www.annapolismarriott.com) stands just where its
name proclaims. Most of the rooms have water views, and some have
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
258

waterfront balconies. If you bring a boat, you can tie it up at the
Marriott’s dock. This comes at a price. Rack rates start at $319 double.
For rooms around $200 or less, try Gibson’s Lodgings (110 Prince George
St.; % 877-330-0057 or 410-268-5555; www.gibsonslodgings.com) —
two historic town houses and a late-20th-century addition. These facili-
ties also are conveniently located a block from the city dock.
Day Trip #3: Taking a Trip to Baltimore
Washington and Baltimore have long shared their residents. Some D.C.
workers live in Baltimore and commute because the cost of living is
lower. Between the time the Baltimore Colts snuck away to Indianapolis
and the Cleveland Browns deserted Cleveland to become the Baltimore
Ravens, Baltimore football fans had to content themselves with following
the Washington Redskins. For more than three decades, D.C. baseball
fans made the trek up to watch the Baltimore Orioles, because the
nation’s pastime deserted the nation’s capital until the Montreal Expos
moved to Washington in 2005 to become the Nationals. The Washington
Wizards NBA team used to be the Baltimore Bullets. And, to the extent
Baltimore has hockey fans, they have to go to D.C. to watch the NHL
Capitals.
There are more reasons for a Washington visitor to travel up to Balti-
more for a day or two — starting with the food, the harbor, the history,
the art, and fun for kids.
Getting there
Baltimore’s an easy jaunt from D.C. by any mode of transportation. To
drive from downtown Washington, take New York Avenue (U.S. 50) east.
Shortly after you leave the city, go north on the Baltimore-Washington
Parkway (Maryland 295), which will take you right into downtown
Baltimore. After you pass the Ravens’ and Orioles’ stadiums, turn right
on West Pratt Street to get to the Inner Harbor. Several parking garages
stand near the Inner Harbor. The closest has entrances on Calvert and
South streets, to the left off Pratt as you pass the Inner Harbor while fol-
lowing the directions above. The downtown-to-downtown drive shouldn’t
take more than an hour, depending on both cities’ traffic conditions, of
course.
Maryland Rail Commuter (% 800-325-7245; www.mtamaryland.com)
runs MARC trains between Baltimore’s Penn Station and D.C.’s Union
Station for $7 one way on weekdays. Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.
amtrak.com) runs trains every day for as low as $14 one way. Grey-
hound (% 800-231-2222; www.greyhound.com) also charges about $14
for the bus ride. The trip takes about an hour on MARC trains, 30 to 40
minutes on Amtrak, 55 to 95 minutes by bus.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 259

Seeing the sights at Inner Harbor
There’s lots to do within a very compact area at the Inner Harbor. First,
you can check in at the Baltimore Visitor Center (401 Light St.; % 877-
225-8466) for info on the best things to see in the city. If you need it, the
folks here also can help you book a hotel room, make restaurant reserva-
tions, and buy tickets to attractions and events.
Harborplace (along Pratt and Light streets at the Inner Harbor; % 410-
332-0060; www.harborplace.com), built right along the water, is a large,
modern shopping-eating-drinking complex. You’ll find more than 100
shops, restaurants, and fast-food spots here — most of them national
chains. This is not where to go for Baltimore’s best cooking. But it’s fun
to grab a seat and a drink on one of the balconies that overlook the
water. Musicians often perform along the Inner Harbor’s walkways — 
I caught a very good doo-wop group one evening.
Your children will find lots to do in this area. Luckily, you’ll find that
accompanying them is pretty interesting, too.
Baltimore’s National Aquarium (501 E. Pratt Street; % 410-576-3800;
www.aqua.org) puts Washington’s little basement fish tank to shame.
The aquarium’s 115,000 square feet of floor space hold tanks with more
than a million gallons of water. More than 14,000 creatures call this place
home — not just fish, but frogs, crocodiles, and other water-loving ani-
mals as well. The big hit with kids is the dolphin show. In addition to
entertaining you, the trainers explain how they get these water-dwelling
mammals to do their tricks.
This kids are going to want to sit in the front row and squeal with delight
when the soaring dolphins splash them. You, on the other hand, will
want to be sure to sit in the splash-free zone.
Tickets are $22, seniors 60 and older $21, children 3 to 11 $13, younger
kids free. Add in the dolphin show, and the prices jump to $25, $24, and
$14. Friday after 5 p.m. you can get in for $8. The aquarium is open
January, February, November, and December Saturday through Thursday
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday till 8 p.m. Though closing hours are the same
March through June and September through October, opening hours are
at 9 a.m. July to late August the aquarium is open daily 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Closing time during the last week or so of August is 6 p.m. Saturday
through Thursday. Closed Thanksgiving, December 25.
Another kid-magnet stands at the other end of Harborplace — the
Maryland Science Center (601 Light St.; information line % 410-685-
5225, live operator 410-685-2370; www.mdsci.org). This place is jam-
packed with interactive exhibits that parents like to play with almost as
much as the kids. (Did I say “almost”?)
The center is run by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, which has 
been promoting science since 1797. The academy aims to teach while

entertaining, so a lot of painless education occurs here. The dinosaur
exhibit, for example, addresses evolution and climate change. The
largest skeleton on display — 45 feet long, 15 feet tall — goes by the
marvelous name “giganotosaurus.” Interactive activities include a pale-
ontological dig. Another exhibit — called TerraLink — is full of high-
tech, hands-on activities that show how the Earth’s environment, water,
and land interact. You see how volcanoes erupt, how wind shapes sand
dunes, and how tornadoes and hurricanes go about their destructive
work. Other exhibits deal with the human body, medicine, magnetism,
light, sound, and the Chesapeake Bay’s ecosystem. There’s a planetar-
ium and an IMAX theater. The Kids Room was specifically designed for
children younger than eight. Memorial Day through Labor Day, the
center is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The rest of the year, it’s open
Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed December 25. Tickets cost $15, seniors
60 and older $14, children 3 to 12 $10. Additional charges for planetar-
ium, films, and special exhibitions.
Not far from the aquarium and the science center is yet a third place for
children, Port Discovery (35 Market Place; % 410-727-3042; www.port
discovery.com). It’s a marvelous three-story play land for kids ages
two to ten.
The first thing you see when you walk in the door is a mini soccer pitch.
There’s a gigantic climbing area with giant slides and a zip line. Kids can
build things with giant (I keep using that word!) tinker toys. There also
are interactive educational exhibits and arts-and-crafts programs.
Port Discover is open October through May Tuesday through Friday 
9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.;
Memorial Day through Labor Day Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m., Fridays early July through late August till
8 p.m.; after Labor Day through September Friday 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Closed Thanksgiving
and December 25. Tickets cost $11, children younger than two are free.
Taking in Baltimore’s art scene
Baltimore boasts a rich cultural heritage. Here are three of the best
places to check out the city’s art.
Consider the three buildings themselves to be part of the art at the
Walters Art Museum (600 N. Charles St.; % 410-547-9000; www.the
walters.org). The newest addition, opened in 1974 and renovated in
2001, presents a starkly modern face, with a four-story glass entryway,
glass atrium, and hanging staircase. Henry Walters’s original gallery,
built between 1904 and 1909, was modeled on Italian Renaissance and
baroque palaces. The sculpture court features a marble floor, columns,
and a two-story skylight. Touring the third building, which was con-
structed between 1848 and 1850, is like perusing a private art collection
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
262

in a mansion. Don’t fail to climb the spiral staircase which leads to a
stained glass dome.
The collection of more than 28,000 objects stretches from ancient Egypt
to late-19th-century Europe. Works also come from Greece, Rome, the
Islamic world, Asia, and America. In addition to paintings and sculp-
tures, the Walters shows off rare books, mummy masks, medieval armor,
and Art Deco jewelry. You’ll find works by Monet, Manet, Delacroix,
Raphael, El Greco, and other masters.
The Walters puts on many children’s programs. Call ahead to see what
might be on tap during your visit.
The Walters is open Wednesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and till 8 p.m. Friday. Closed most federal holidays and December 24.
Admission is free.
All three of these museums have in-house eating facilities. At the
Baltimore Museum of Art, Gertrude’s (% 410-889-3399; www.john
shields.com/restaurant/rest/gertrudes.html) is a popular desti-
nation in its own right for crab cakes and Sunday brunch. The museum
also can give you a map that shows other restaurants in the area. A lot
of them are moderately priced to attract Johns Hopkins University stu-
dents. There’s good crab soup and interesting fry-bread sandwiches at
Rocky Run Tap & Grill (3105 St. Paul St.; % 410-235-2501; www.rocky
run.com), a typical college pub.
Maryland’s largest art museum, the Baltimore Museum of Art (10 Art
Museum Dr.; % 443-573-1700; www.artbma.org) houses a distinguished
and eclectic collection. The Cone Collection was assembled by two
Baltimore sisters — Claribel and Etta Cone — who bought works by
Matisse and Picasso from the artists at their studios, and also acquired
paintings by Cézanne, Gauguin, van Gogh, and Renoir.
Among the vast array of other items you won’t have time to see in one
visit are painting and sculpture from around the world and throughout
history, decorative arts, furniture, silver, textiles, and folk art. Period
rooms from six Maryland houses have been reassembled here, and there
is a gallery of miniature rooms with furnishings. Among the artists repre-
sented: Manet, van Dyck, Rembrandt, Rodin, Botticelli, Warhol, Johns,
Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein, Calder, as well as photographers Man Ray,
Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Weston.
If you’ve got kids in tow, check at the information desk for children’s
activities.
The museum is open Wednesday through Friday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and till 9 p.m. on the first
Thursday of each month. Closed January 1, July 4, Thanksgiving, 
and December 25. Admission is free. There’s a fee for some special 
exhibitions.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 263

Baltimore’s most unusual arts spot is the American Visionary Arts
Museum (800 Key Hwy.; % 410-244-1900; www.avam.org). It is essen-
tially a showcase for art by amateurs — or, as the museum itself puts it,
“art produced by self-taught individuals, usually without formal training,
whose works arise from an innate personal vision that revels foremost in
the creative act itself.” It’s not folk art, the museum says, because it’s not
tied to any long-lived cultural tradition. So, what kind of art do you
encounter here? Well, before you enter the building you’ll have a hard
time missing the 55-foot-tall, multicolored, wind-powered “Giant Whirligig.”
Most of the inside space is devoted to changing exhibitions. Examples of
what you might find: sculptures made of toothpicks or bottle caps, deco-
rated funeral urns, or installations covered with aluminum foil. At first
glance, this all seems quite whimsical and silly. But the museum is dead
serious about the motivations and messages of these untaught artists.
Exhibition themes can be heavy — even disturbing. Because much of
what’s here is obviously attractive to children, the museum warns you
when material is inappropriate for young eyes.
The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed
Thanksgiving and December 25. Admission is $12; seniors 55 and older,
children 7 and older, and students $8; younger than 6 are free.
Touching through Baltimore’s history
The Star Spangled Banner still waves — or at least a replica does — at
Fort McHenry (2400 E. Fort Ave.; % 410-962-4290; www.nps.gov/fomc),
3 miles southeast of the Inner Harbor and across the Patapsco River
from Fells Point, which we will visit next. It was from here that U.S.
troops prevented British warships from approaching Baltimore during
the War of 1812. The battle occurred near the end of the war, in Septem-
ber 1814, and was observed by Francis Scott Key, a prisoner on a British
ship. Key penned the poem that later was set to music and became the
U.S. national anthem.
The fort stayed in service until the 1920s, when it became a national
park, later redesignated as a national monument and historic shrine. It
looks pretty much as it did when Key watched the battle and wondered
if the flag still flew. You can wander through all the buildings in the fort,
walk around the perimeter and down to the riverside, and check out the
exhibits in the visitor center. The fort is open early June through early
September daily 8 a.m. to 7:45 p.m., till 4:45 p.m. the rest of the year.
Admission to the fort is $7, children 15 and younger free. No charge to
enter the visitor center and grounds around the fort.
While the Inner Harbor development is new, glittery, and synthetic, Fells
Point (% 410-675-6750; www.fellspoint.us) remembers the city’s
gritty origins and growth as an important maritime center. Today, more
than 30 million tons of cargo pass through Baltimore’s port every year.
Back in 1726, William Fell founded a shipbuilding company in Baltimore’s
oldest neighborhood which later took his name. Cobblestone streets are
Part IV: Exploring Washington, D.C. 
264

still lined with 18th and 19th century houses here today. Streets carry
old English names, such as Shakespeare, Fleet, and Thames.
If you were a fan of the old television show Homicide: Life on the
Street, you’ll recognize the beat-up entrance to the police station on
Thames Street that served as that show’s precinct headquarters. The
Broadway Market, on Broadway between Lancaster and Fleet streets, is
a collection of shops, delis, restaurants, and greasy spoons that serve up
flowers, fruit, deli meats, baked goods, candy, coffee, pizza, sandwiches,
fried chicken, and other simple food. The best thing to do in this neigh-
borhood is to wander among the antique shops, clothing boutiques,
restaurants, and bars, primarily along Broadway and Thames, south of
Fleet. Corduroy Button (1628 Thames St.; % 410-276-5437) sells chil-
dren’s clothing. Dudley & Max (1625 Thames St.; % 410-522-7735) 
sells clothing and other things for pets. Another Period in Time (1708
Fleet St.; % 410-675-4776) is an antique shop. Silk Road (905 S. Ann St.;
% 410-675-1705) sells Oriental rugs, textiles, and home furnishings.
There’s a Ten Thousand Villages at 1621 Thames St. (% 410-342-5568).
(See the Alexandria shopping section for more details about this chain
of fair-trade stores.)
You might do a double-take when a horse-drawn cart full of produce
goes clip-clopping by. These streets sport a broad range of eating estab-
lishments of various ethnic extractions, and I saw no evidence of a fast-
food chain. See the next section for a review of Bonaparte’s charming
French cafe, and “Spending the Night in Baltimore” for a review of the
Admiral Fell Inn.
Where to dine
I think it’s in the Constitution that if you go to Baltimore you must eat
crab. One of the classic places to do so is Obrycki’s (1727 E. Pratt St.; 
% 410-732-6399; www.obryckis.com),which has specialized in Mary-
land blue crab since the 1940s. Everything here is about the food. You
eat at a plain table with paper napkins and paper placemats. The cav-
ernous dining room, broken up by red brick archways, is filled with
happy customers. If you close your eyes, you might think you’re on a
construction site. But it’s just the sound of determined diners hammer-
ing away at their hard-shell crabs to get at the delectable meat inside.
There are easier ways to eat crab here, and I confess to taking those
routes. The cream of crab soup is excellent, the bowl brimming with
crab meat. The lump crab meat sautéed in butter is rich and delicious.
The baked potato is cooked to perfection. The bread pudding makes an
excellent dessert. Obrycki’s bakes its own version of Key lime pie, which
is more tart than most. Main courses cost from $15 (for grilled chicken
breast, but who would want that here?) to $30 (for a seafood combina-
tion). Obrycki’s opens daily at 11:30 a.m. In spring and fall it closes
Monday through Friday at 10 p.m., Saturday at 11 p.m., and Sunday at
9:30 p.m. In summer it stays open till 11 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
The restaurant closes from mid-November to mid-March.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 265

Baltimore, which has a Little Italy, may be as well known for Italian cook-
ing as for crab. To sample the Italian, try La Tavola (248 Albemarle St.;
% 410-685-1859; www.la-tavola.com), which serves excellent food at
reasonable prices. Start with the antipasto Italiano, a generous selection of
Italian meats and cheeses over a bed of arugula. An excellent pasta course
is perfectly-al-dente rigatoni, with sautéed eggplant and mozzarella in a
flavorful tomato sauce. Mafalde alla Fiorentina is a hearty dish of wide
pasta served with spinach, raisins, pine nuts, and ricotta cheese, sea-
soned with nutmeg and cinnamon. Service here is both warm and profes-
sional, the atmosphere in the dining room serene. Main courses cost from
$12 (pasta with tomato sauce) to $22 (for a couple of seafood dishes). La
Tavola opens at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday through Sunday, closes at 10:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday, 10 p.m. Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday.
Bright and cheerful Bonaparte Breads (903 S. Ann St.; % 410-342-4000) is
a pleasant place to grab lunch or take a snack break while you’re tooling
around Fells Point. Order a sandwich at the counter and grab a leather
upholstered chair by the floor-to-ceiling windows that look toward boats
tied up at the dock across the narrow street. In nice weather, you may see
pleasure boaters conducting their version of a tailgate party — sharing
food and drinks with friends beside their boats. You’ll be tempted to stay
here a long time. The chairs are comfy, and the room is attractive. An
ornate clock — the kind you used to see all the time outside banks — is
suspended from one of the yellow walls. The floor is tile, the ceiling wood.
I was disappointed in the tomato quiche. But the tuna salad, on an excel-
lent baguette, was quite good — and big enough for two to share. Fruit
tarts, like those served here, are one of my major weaknesses. Most of 
the soups, sandwiches, and quiches are $7 to $8. Bonaparte is open daily
8 a.m. to 6 p.m., but only breads and pastries are available after 3 p.m.
As I write this, the hottest restaurant in town is Charleston (1000 Lan-
caster St.; % 410-332-7373; www.charlestonrestaurant.com). It’s
expensive, excellent, and unusual. Charleston’s name explains its roots,
as a Modern American restaurant with Southern influences. Some of that
stays on the menu today — gulf shrimp with andouille sausage and grits,
for instance. But owners Cindy Wolf and Tony Foreman shut the place
down for a bit in 2005 to refurbish both the dining room and the menu.
Now Chef Wolf offers diners a large number of choices of small plates
with which to build their own meals — three to six courses for $67 to
$102, with dessert thrown in for free. Wolf also offers a chef’s menu, and
looking at a recent one is probably the best way to get an idea of what
this restaurant is all about: bisque of lobster, crab, and shrimp; scram-
bled eggs with white truffle; salmon tartare with cucumber and sesame
seeds; grilled lamb tenderloin with basmati rice, lentils, and cucumber
yogurt; morbier cheese; and a crème brûlée trio of vanilla bean, roasted
chestnut, and cinnamon caramel flavors. Charleston is open Monday
through Saturday from 5:30 to 10 p.m.

Spending the night in Baltimore
You can’t beat the location of the Hyatt Regency Baltimore (300 Light
St.; % 888-591-1234 or 410-528-1234; www.hyatt.com). It’s just across
the street from Harborplace — and it’s got its own bridge to get there.
We had a spectacular view of the Inner Harbor from the glass-enclosed
elevator that lifted us to our room, and from the room itself. The just-
renovated rooms are large, and the beds extremely comfortable. The
rooms have all the expected amenities. The hotel has several restau-
rants, including the top-floor Pisces with a more-than-spectacular view.
You can order room service from 6 a.m. till midnight, swim in the out-
door pool in the summer, work out in the gym, jog on the track, play on
the tennis courts, or soak in the hot tub. Rack rates start at $399, but
I’ve found deals as low as $149 off peak. Self-parking is $27, valet $36.
Just down the street from the Hyatt is the even more luxurious Inter-
Continental Harbor Court (550 Light St.; % 800-824-0076 or 410-234-
0550; www.harborcourt.com). Independently owned and operated since
it opened in 1986, the Harbor Court joined the InterContinental chain in
2006. The sitting room of the entrance lobby is called the Library, and its
walls are lined with old books. Pull a few off the shelves, and you may be
surprised to find that many are in foreign languages. Standard rooms
come with bay window, easy chair, table, and desk. One-bedroom suites
have a living-dining area, two bay windows, and an enormous bath. For
$3,500 you can bed down in the Presidential Suite, containing such accou-
trements as a grand piano, wet bar, full kitchen, sitting and dining areas,
and one or two bedrooms. I always wonder what kind of people shell out
$3,000 or more for a hotel room. In this case, the most recent occupant
was Bruce Willis, in town to film another Die Hard movie (no. 412, I think).
The Harbor Court has a large indoor pool, spa, fitness center, outdoor
tennis court, racquetball court, two restaurants, and a lounge. Double
rooms start at $359. Discounts to below $200 are sometimes available.
You say you’ve fallen in love with Fells Point and don’t want to leave?
Well, get yourself a room at the Admiral Fell Inn (888 S. Broadway; 
% 410-522-7377; www.admiralfell.com), cobbled together from 
eight adjoining buildings, some dating to the 18th century. Because the
Admiral’s rooms are in different buildings — from different centuries —
they differ in design and furnishing. There’s a partial canopy bed here,
four-poster with lace canopy there, two rooms sharing a balcony over
there. One bi-level suite has a downstairs living room with a working fire-
place, an upstairs bedroom, a microwave, a fridge, and a Jacuzzi. Each
room is named for a Maryland historical figure, and a plaque outside the
door displays a brief biography. All rooms have television, air-conditioning,
and a private bathroom. Photos of Baltimore, most for sale, decorate 
the inn’s walls. There’s a nautical-themed bar, a basement restaurant
with exposed stone walls, and a library with wood-burning fireplace.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Washington: Three Great Day Trips 267

Rates run from $199 for a standard room to $500 for a suite. The inn
tacks on an additional $10-a-day “destination fee” that covers unlimited
local and domestic long distance phone calls, high-speed Internet access,
access to a hotel computer and printer, newspaper, and a shuttle to vari-
ous parts of town. Valet parking costs $25. Ask about packages.

Part V
Living It Up After
Dark: D.C. Nightlife

In this part . . . 
W
hen it comes to nightlife, D.C. ain’t New York. For
many Washingtonians, this is ﬁrst, foremost, and
almost always a place to work. Period. But that doesn’t mean
you can’t enjoy D.C. after dark. This part gives you the low-
down on where to ﬁnd the best shows, concerts, neighbor-
hood watering holes, and music/dance clubs — plus I’ll tell
you about D.C.’s high culture (symphony, opera, and dance),
which is top-notch and constantly getting better. Washington
is the land of freebies, even when it comes to music and thea-
ter, so you can scratch your cultural itch without opening
your wallet.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter
 Getting information and tickets
 Dining before the curtain goes up
 Knowing what’s hot on the cultural scene
 Taking in a play, concert, or dance performance
U
nlike the famous cherry trees, Washington’s cultural scene knows
no particular season and blooms year-round. Over the years, a
dazzling array of theatrical venues has sprouted for residents and visi-
tors alike.
Getting the Inside Scoop 
on the D.C. Arts Scene
You could spend your entire Washington visit in the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts (2700 F St. NW, between New Hampshire
Avenue and Rock Creek Parkway; concerts % 800-444-1324 or 202-467-
4600, tours 202-416-8340; www.kennedy-center.org) and partake of
just about every type of performance you enjoy.
The center, a living memorial to the martyred president, is both a per-
formance venue and a tourist attraction in its own right. It also was a
long time a-coming.
President Eisenhower signed legislation creating a “national cultural
center” in 1958. Kennedy himself was an ardent fundraiser for the proj-
ect. After Kennedy’s assassination, Congress designated the center as
his memorial. President Johnson broke ground in 1965. The center
finally opened in 1971, during the Nixon presidency, with a performance
of Leonard Bernstein’s “Requiem” for Kennedy.

Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 273

Today, the center is a world-class cultural venue, with concert hall,
opera house, movie theater, and other facilities. It’s home to the
National Symphony and the Washington National Opera. It also hosts
numerous local and traveling troupes in all the performing arts.
The halls outside the performance venues are truly grand. More than 
40 nations donated building materials and works of art. Great views 
are to be had from the top-floor restaurants and promenade. You can
attend performances here, including daily free performances on the
Millennium Stage. And you can take a tour.
The center is open daily from 10 a.m. until 30 minutes after last perform-
ance. Tours are conducted Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Admission is free to the
building. You pay, of course, for tickets to most performances.
The box office, in the Kennedy Center Hall of States, is open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sundays and holidays from noon
to 9 p.m. For a 10-percent surcharge, you can place a phone order from
10 a.m. until 9 p.m. daily by calling % 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600.
Tickets can be purchased online, again with a 10-percent surcharge, at
www.kennedy-center.org/tickets. You can get further ticket informa-
tion from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily by calling % 202-467-4600.
Free shuttle service is available from the Foggy Bottom–George
Washington University Metrorail Station every 15 minutes from 9:45 a.m.
until midnight Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. until midnight Saturdays,
noon until midnight Sundays, and 4 p.m. until midnight on federal holi-
days. Look for signs to the left as you get off the station escalator.
You can obtain tickets for “VIP” tours of the center from members of
Congress.

Fabulous freebies
The best news for those traveling on a tight budget is that free performances are as
much a part of Washington as spin doctors and negative campaign advertising.
The Kennedy Center offers free shows on the Millennium Stage in the Grand Foyer
daily at 6 p.m. Audiences enjoy midsummer nights’ freebies when the Shakespeare
Theatre plays outdoors in Rock Creek Park’s Carter Barron Amphitheatre, off 16th
Street and Colorado Avenue NW. The National Symphony and military bands present
free outdoor concerts at several sites from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The
National Mall has become an outdoor theater for screening classic movies in the
summer. The Washington National Opera occasionally projects a live performance
onto a screen on the Mall. Horrendous weather unfortunately discouraged all but a
few true buffs from taking in Madame Butterfly in November 2006.

Half-price tickets for some Kennedy Center performances are available in
limited numbers to full-time students through graduate school, seniors 65
and older, enlisted military personnel in grades E-1 to E-4, and people on
fixed incomes below $5,000 a year or with permanent disabilities. If you
have a disability, you can order tickets by phone. Others must get them
at the box office. Tickets are available in advance for opening nights and
some other performances. The rest are sold on performance day, begin-
ning at noon for matinees and 6 p.m. for evening shows. Except for ele-
mentary and secondary school students, you must produce proof of
eligibility — student or military ID card, Medicare card, driver’s license,
or other government document indicating age or income. Those with dis-
abilities can show an ID card obtained from Kennedy Center.
All these events occur at just one venue. Year-round, on any given 
day, you can count on finding performing artists on many stages in
Washington.
The play’s the thing
In a city that generates more than its share of political theater, dramatic
and musical theater also thrives.
Broadway-bound shows and resurrected classics account for much the-
atrical activity at the Kennedy Center (See contact information above.)
Arena Stage (1101 6th St. SW, at Maine Ave; % 202-488-3300; www.arena
stage.org), on the other hand, presents new works, reinterprets older
works, and offers a diverse mix of shows. Now more than 50 years old,
Arena can brag about a distinguished life so far: It was the first not-for-
profit theater in the United States, the first regional theater to transfer a
production to Broadway, the first regional theater invited by the U.S. State
Department to tour behind the Iron Curtain, and the first regional to win 
a Tony.
D.C.’s diminutive Theater District — I don’t think I’ll compare it to
Broadway — spans a portion of Downtown and Penn Quarter, east of 
the White House. The most active stages are:
 National Theatre (1321 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, between 13th and
14th streets; % 800-447-7400 or 202-628-6161, children’s programs
202-783-3372; www.nationaltheatre.org).
 Warner Theatre (513 13th Street NW, between E and F streets; 
% 202-783-4000; www.warnertheatre.com).
 Ford’s Theatre (511 10th St. NW, between E and F streets; % 202-
347-4833; www.fordstheatre.org).
 Studio Theatre (1501 14th St. NW, at P Street; % 202-332-3300;
www.studiotheatre.org), which focuses on contemporary works
by young artists, but is not limited to that. The 2004 season
included Tommy, The Who’s rock opera, for instance.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 275

 Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company (641 D St. NW, between 6th
and 7th streets; % 202-393-3939; www.woollymammoth.net),
which moved into new quarters in Penn Quarter in mid-2005.
Woolly presents plays that “explore the edges of theatrical style
and human experience.”
 Shakespeare Theatre (450 7th St. NW, between D and E streets; 
% 202-547-1122; www.shakespearetheatre.org). These thespi-
ans perform the bard and other playwrights at their marvelous the-
ater complex in Penn Quarter. Catch them for free in the summer at
Carter Baron Amphitheater (16th Street and Colorado Avenue NW;
% 202-426-0486; www.nps.gov/rocr/cbarron).
 The Folger Shakespeare Library (201 E. Capitol St. SE, at 2nd
Street; % 202-544-7077; www.folger.edu/whatson.cfm) provides
D.C.’s most interesting setting for theater-going. It’s a replica of an
Elizabethan theater. While Shakespeare’s plays obviously provide
the core of the Folger’s offerings, works by other playwrights are
performed as well, and the theater presents poetry readings and
concerts of early European music.
Hearing the sounds of music
The National Symphony Orchestra, one of the world’s best, plays in the
Kennedy Center Concert Hall (2700 F St. NW, between New Hampshire
Avenue and Rock Creek Parkway; % 800-444-1324, 202-467-4600; www.
kennedy-center.org/nso). In summer, these musicians take some of
their concerts outdoors. Leonard Slatkin is the musical director, with
other world-renowned conductors and musicians making guest appear-
ances. The symphony’s performances frequently sell out, so make your
reservations early.
Hot time: Summer in the city
If you visit Washington in summer and enjoy classical music, check 
out the National Symphony’s free concerts on the West Lawn of the
Capitol, on the Sunday of the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends,
and on July 4. You also can catch a free concert by the NSO several
times in summer at the Carter Barron Amphitheatre in Rock Creek Park
(16th Street and Colorado Avenue NW; % 202-426-0486; www.nps.gov/
rocr/cbarron). These events are some of the top perks of summer in
this city. The Capitol Lawn concerts are enormously popular, so you
need to arrive early and be prepared to go through security screening.
The symphony also performs outdoors in summer at Wolf Trap Farm
Park for the Performing Arts (1551 Trap Rd., Vienna, Virginia, off the
Wolf Trap exit from the Dulles Toll Road; % 703-255-1800; www.nps.
gov/wotr; more details in Chapter 18).
The rousing Fourth of July concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol
features the National Symphony, guest artists, celebrity hosts, and an
enthusiastic audience. The evening ends with a bang when the 1812
Overture accompanies the fireworks display on the Mall (or vice versa,
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: D.C. Nightlife 
276

depending on your viewpoint). Arrive early, be braced for crowds, and
bring something to sit on. You also can catch a live broadcast of the con-
cert on public television.
Beat some of the crowds at all these concerts by showing up the night
before for the dress rehearsal.
A night at the opera
Washington’s opera aficionados are thrilled that superstar tenor Placido
Domingo is general director of the Washington National Opera (2700 F
St. NW, between New Hampshire Avenue and Rock Creek Parkway, in
Kennedy Center; % 800-876-7372, 202-295-2400; www.dc-opera.org).
Under Domingo’s leadership, the troupe mounts classic shows and
pushes the envelope with modern material. The 2006–07 season, for
instance, included such standards as Puccini’s Madame Butterfly and
Wagner’s The Valkyrie — as well as the North American première of
Sophie’s Choice, Nicholas Maw’s adaptation of the William Styron novel
that was made into a hit movie starring Meryl Streep. When perform-
ances sell out, the opera sells standing room tickets at the box office and
by phone (% 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600) for $25.
Enjoying an evening of dance
The best in the dance world grace Washington’s stages. Such world-
class troupes as the Kirov, the Royal, the Joffrey, the Bolshoi, and the
American Ballet Theatre came here for the 2006–07 season alone. The
city also is quite proud of its own Washington Ballet (% 202-362-3606;
www.washingtonballet.org), which performs in several venues,
including Kennedy Center. Every Christmas season, the ballet performs
the Nutcracker at the Warner Theater.
Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
If you want to take in a play, concert, or dance performance during your
D.C. visit, it pays to do a little homework before you arrive. Surf to the
Washington Post Web site (www.washingtonpost.com) and click on “City
Guide” near the top of the home page. You also can peruse the Post’s
daily Style section, Sunday Arts section, and Friday Weekend magazine.
Tickets, please!
Competition for tickets to a popular performance can be keen. To get the
best seats (or any seats!) for a hit show, you need to buy tickets as far in
advance as possible.
If you order tickets over the phone, ask about the seat location; at the
box office, ask to see a diagram of the theater.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 277

To order tickets to most events, call Ticketmaster (% 800-551-7328 or
202-397-7328) or visit Ticketmaster’s Web site www.ticketmaster.com.
Expect to pay an outlandish surcharge. Tickets.com (% 800-400-9373;
www.tickets.com) pretty much covers what Ticketmaster doesn’t. 
Like Ticketmaster, expect to pay a high surcharge. If your hotel has a
concierge, he or she should be able to get tickets to many events. You
may have to pay a surcharge, and you should tip the concierge for the
service.

The best pre-theater dining
If you’re catching a theater performance, be seated for dinner no later than 6 p.m., as
most curtains go up at 7:30 or 8 p.m. Choose someplace near the theater, in case the
service is slow. (Wouldn’t you rather sprint a couple of blocks than hail a cab and
maybe miss Act I?) When you arrive at the restaurant, tell the host or waiter (or both)
that you’re going to an event and need to be out by a certain time. Order soon after
you’re seated and save the soufflé and other dishes requiring lots of preparation for
a non-theater evening.
Many restaurants offer pre-theater, fixed-price menus. This dinner usually includes
an appetizer or salad, entree, and dessert. Pre-theater specials usually are available
from 4:30 or 5 p.m. to 6 or 6:30 p.m. You can spend considerably less than you would if
you ordered à la carte.
If you have tickets for a show, consider the following pre-theater deals:
 Marcel’s (2401 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, at 24th Street; % 202-296-1166) has the
coolest pre- (and post-) theater deal. This highly acclaimed restaurant serves 
you dinner between 5:30 and 7 p.m., sends you by limo to the Kennedy Center for
your show, and then brings you back to the restaurant for dessert after the show,
all for $48.
 The pre-theater dinner at Circle Bistro (1 Washington Circle NW, at 23rd Street
and New Hampshire Avenue; % 202-293-5390) is served from 5 to 7 p.m. and 
costs $35.
 Near the Shakespeare and Ford’s theaters, Café Atlántico (405 8th St. NW,
between D and E streets;% 202-393-0812; www.cafeatlantico.com), serves
its pre-theater meal for $28 from 5 to 6:30 p.m.
 The restaurants in the Kennedy Center don’t offer pre-theater specials, but they
certainly are handy places to eat before a show. Reservations are recommended
at the full-service Roof Terrace Restaurant (2700 F St. NW; % 202-416-8555;
www.kennedy-center.org/visitor/restaurants.html). They’re not
accepted at the KC Cafe, which also is located on the roof terrace level.
See Chapter 10 for reviews of other restaurants. Ask restaurants near your theater
whether they offer a pre-theater special.

For cut-rate tickets to same-day performances, go to Ticket Place, which
moved in 2004 to a new location at 407 7th St. NW between D and E
streets, near the Gallery Place/Chinatown and Archives/Navy Memorial
Metrorail stations. Ticket Place sells same-day (and some advance-sale)
tickets for 62 percent of face value. The ticket booth is open Tuesday to
Friday between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. or Saturday between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Some tickets are sold on the Internet (www.ticketplace.org) for 67
percent of face value Tuesday to Friday noon to 4 p.m. Ticket Place
doesn’t sell tickets by phone but does provide recorded information at
% 202-842-5387. Because Ticket Place is closed Sunday and Monday,
tickets for those days sometimes can be purchased on Saturday. If you
can’t find a bargain here, you can pay big-time for Ticketmaster service
at the same location.
Some theaters set aside tickets for seniors and full-time students and
sell them the day of the performance. If you don’t ask, you don’t get!
Gamblers are advised to arrive at the box office a half-hour before cur-
tain time; sometimes unclaimed reserved tickets are available. If you’re
determined to attend a performance that’s sold out, ask about SRO
(standing room only) tickets. If someone leaves at intermission, you may
get lucky and snag a seat.
Curtain calls
Some people blame it on the preponderance of military officers and
bureaucrats in D.C. For whatever reason, Washingtonians are a punctual
lot, so you usually can count on the curtain rising on time. A good gen-
eral rule is to arrive at least 15 minutes early so that you can visit the
restroom and buy your overpriced snack. (I’ve seen the line to the ladies
room snake all the way to Kentucky five minutes before a performance.
Seldom, it seems, does that happen to us men.) Many venues will not
seat latecomers until a break in the program occurs — which may mean
intermission.
Dressing the part
A night at the theater no longer demands a suit and tie or dress and high
heels. Most Washington theatergoers are a shade or two less formal and
flamboyant. Knock yourself out and preen your feathers if that’s your
style, but the usher will show you to your seat no matter what your
attire — well, within reason. When in doubt, follow your mother’s advice
and “wash behind your ears, comb your hair, and look presentable.” Try
slacks or a skirt, a shirt or blouse, a jacket or sweater, a tie if you want.
Now, go make your entrance.
Finding Things for the Kids
Washington offers wonderful cultural opportunities for families, espe-
cially during the school year. Look to the following for entertaining pro-
ductions that are geared to youngsters.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 279

 The Discovery Theater (in the Ripley Center, just west of the
Smithsonian Castle, 1100 Jefferson Dr. SW; % 202-357-1500; www.
discoverytheater.si.edu) presents live performances for chil-
dren of all ages.
 The Kennedy Center (2700 F St. NW, between New Hampshire
Avenue and Rock Creek Parkway; % 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600;
www.kennedy-center.org/programs/family) presents many
youth and family programs. These include plays and musicals for
children and special concerts.
 Tickets are free for the children’s program “Saturday Morning at
the National Theatre” (1321 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, between 13th
and 14th streets; % 202-628-6161; www.nationaltheatre.org/
saturday/saturday.htm). Get them — first-come, first-served —
a half hour before each of the 9:30 and 11 a.m. programs. Recent
programs included Mother Goose and her Fabulous Puppet Friends,
Red Riding Hood, and Romeo and Juliet adapted for kids.
 The Washington Ballet’s Nutcracker, performed during the Christmas
season at the Warner Theatre (513 13th St. NW, between E and F
streets; % 202-783-4000; www.warnertheatre.com), is a treat for
everyone in the family. Tickets are sold through Ticketmaster 
(% 800-551-7328 or 202-397-7328; www.ticketmaster.com).
 The “petting zoo” before the National Symphony Orchestra’s
Family Concerts (2700 F St. NW, between New Hampshire Avenue
and Rock Creek Parkway; % 800-444-1324 or 202-467-4600; www.
kennedy-center.org/nso/programs/family) is a treat for bud-
ding young musicians and even those who don’t know they’re bud-
ding yet. The concerts are designed to appeal to anyone seven or
older. During the “zoo,” one hour before each concert, kids can go
up to the stage and handle instruments. After 3 p.m. concerts, per-
formers stay to answer children’s questions and to tell stories
about what it’s like to be a musician.

F
eeling thirsty for a chilled cocktail and some hot jazz? Longing to
find a pub that stores 1,000 beers in its fridge? Itching to rock the
night away? Longing for laughs? Rest assured, after the lights go off in
the White House, you can take the party elsewhere, such as Adams-
Morgan, Georgetown, Dupont Circle, or the ever-more-booming Penn
Quarter. It’s true that a segment of Washingtonians think a hit night is
popcorn and C-SPAN reruns. But lots of young people and a large cosmo-
politan population have spawned clubs, bars, and other nightspots that
appeal to D.C.’s multicultural citizenry.
Before you head off to strut your stuff, keep in mind that Washington’s
subway system doesn’t run around the clock. But Metrorail does run
later — and earlier — than it used to. The system opens at 5 a.m. week-
days and 7 a.m. weekends. It closes at midnight Sunday through Thursday
and 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Check when the last train leaves from the
station you plan to use at the end of your night of revelry. Leave yourself
plenty of time to get to the station, or you may find yourself having to hail
a cab. Be aware: D.C. cabs, plentiful during business hours, make like
Cinderella’s coach at night.
For a comprehensive listing of the entertainment happenings, see the
“Weekend” section of the Friday Washington Post. The free City Paper —
available in bookstores, restaurants, bars, and cafes all around town —
is another good source for information on what’s going on.

Focusing on the Music: The Best Jazz Clubs
D.C.’s premier jazz club is Blues Alley (1073 Wisconsin Ave. NW, in the
alley south of M Street; % 202-337-4141; www.bluesalley.com) in
Georgetown. All the top touring artists come here. Dizzy Gillespie,
Charlie Byrd, Stanley Turrentine, Ahmad Jamal, and Ramsey Lewis cut
live albums at the club. As I write this, the club’s menu of upcoming per-
formers includes Larry Coryell, Oregon, Mose Allison, Bucky Pizzarelli,
Stanley Clarke, and Arturo Sandoval. Blues Alley bills itself as a jazz
supper club and serves Creole cuisine, steak, and seafood from 6 p.m.
and lighter fare after 10 p.m. Reservations are recommended, and the
best way to get good seats is to book an early dinner. This place isn’t
cheap. In addition to the ticket charge, which varies with the popularity
of the musicians, there’s a $2.50 cover and $10 minimum. The aforemen-
tioned Allison was fetching $24, Pizzarelli $35, and Clarke more than $50.
If you opt for dinner, entrees run from $17 to $23. The club offers half-
price admission to students and congressional staff with ID for some 
10 p.m. shows Sunday through Thursday. Shows start at 8 and 10 p.m.
most nights.
The Bohemian Caverns (2001 11th St. NW, at U Street; % 202-299-0801;
www.bohemiancaverns.com) is a renovation and expansion of the
Crystal Caverns, which showcased such jazz greats as Duke Ellington,
Pearl Bailey, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie
Holiday from the ’20s to the ’60s. A full-service restaurant resides within
this multistoried jazz club. Call ahead for information on performances,
which aren’t scheduled every night. The club has a business-casual
dress code. Cover is usually $10 to $20.
Friday nights on Capitol Hill, upstairs at Mr. Henry’s (601 Pennsylvania
Ave. SE, at 6th Street; % 202-546-8412) is the place for jazz. This com-
fortable, popular restaurant is known as a gathering plays for gays and
lesbians, but it attracts lots of straight men and women for the music,
the food, and the laid-back atmosphere. You pay an $8 minimum to enter
the room where the music plays from 8:30 p.m.
Some restaurants and cafes present live jazz along with their food and
drink. Look them up in Chapter 10 for details. Traditional jazz groups
play on Friday and Saturday nights at B. Smith’s, in Union Station.
Georgia Brown’s serves a jazz brunch Downtown from 10 a.m. to 
2:15 p.m. Sundays. Kinkead’s, in Foggy Bottom/West End, offers live jazz
from 6:30 to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. From late May to mid-
September, jazz groups perform outdoors from 5 to 8:30 p.m. at the
Pavilion Cafe in the National Gallery of Art’s Sculpture Garden. From 6
to 10 p.m. Fridays, a portion of the National Museum of Natural History
becomes the Smithsonian Jazz Café, with food, drink, and live music for
a $10 cover (kids 12 and younger free).

Turning Up the Volume: Rock and Pop Venues
Many rockers believe the 9:30 Club’s (815 V St. NW, at Vermont Avenue;
% 202-393-0930; www.930.com.) state-of-the-art sound system makes it
the best place to hear pop music. It’s sure not the seats — there are 
very few!
Pink, Cat Power, Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Ice-T, Alanis Morissette — and Tony Bennett! — have played
here. The cover charge depends on the act. Call or check the Web site to
find out when performances are scheduled. The club’s only open when
someone’s playing, and you’re wise to get advance tickets for big-name
acts. Tickets are available through the club’s Web site and at the box
office, which is open Monday through Friday from noon to 7 p.m., and
during shows. When there’s a show, doors open Sunday through
Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m. The first act starts
45 to 75 minutes later. The 9:30 is in the U Street Corridor, an up-and-
coming entertainment district. But the club’s corner is still a pretty
skuzzy looking place. Stick with the crowd on your way to and from the
nearby Vermont Avenue exit of the U Street/Cardozo Metrorail Station.
Don’t go wandering down any dark side streets. If you drive, park in the
garage across the street for $10. It’s wise to make a parking reservation
with the club, which runs the garage. Or, just take a cab.
The coolest felines purr at the Black Cat (1811 14th St. NW, between S
and T streets; % 202-667-7960). You don’t pay a cover charge in the Red
Room bar, which has pool tables, pinball machines, a jukebox with an
eclectic selection of music, and a laid-back atmosphere. The ground
floor Backstage hosts poetry readings and films. The menu at the Food
for Thought Cafe satisfies vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike.
Things get hopping upstairs at Mainstage, the concert room which
showcases underground/alternative performers and has a dance floor
that holds 400. The Black Cat does not limit its musical tastes. Hip hop,
techno, swing, and folk are all heard here. Performers have included
Bright Eyes, the Roots, Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, Foo Fighters, Korn, 
We Are Scientists, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and — conceding nothing to 
nearby 9:30 — Pete Seeger. Cover charge in the concert room depends
on the act. You can get tickets at Ticketmaster (% 800-551-7328; www.
ticketmaster.com), and at the box office (cash only). Backstage tickets
are sold at the door only. Mainstage and Backstage open Sunday through
Thursday at 8:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 9:30 p.m. Mainstage open-
ing act starts 30 minutes later. Hours at the Red Room are Sunday
through Thursday 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday and Saturday 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
The cafe opens at the same times, and closes an hour earlier.
The big-big-big stars — the kind that can draw tens of thousands to 
a single concert — stop at the big-big-big venues. When Simon and
Garfunkel brought their reunion tour to town in late 2003, for example,
they set up shop at what is now called Verizon Center (601 F St. NW, at
6th Street; % 202-661-5000; www.verizoncenter.com). Verizon Center

also is where Bruce Springsteen and his fellow political-activist perform-
ers finished their ill-fated “Vote for Change” tour on the eve of the 2004
election. More recently, Bob Seger, Justin Timberlake, the Who, and
Christina Aguilera have been on the center’s schedule. Most nights, 
this is where you find the Washington Wizards National Basketball
Association team, the Washington Capitals National Hockey League team,
the Washington Mystics Women’s NBA entry, and some Georgetown
University basketball games.
Odd fact: When this used to be called MCI Center, it picked up the nick-
name the “Phone Booth.” When naming rights went to another tele-
phone company, the official name changed but the nickname stuck.
When the Phone Booth’s 20,000-plus concert seats aren’t enough, super-
stars take their acts to Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (East
Capitol Street at 22nd Street; % 202-547-9077; www.dcsec.com), which
can accommodate 55,000 or more. The Rolling Stones rocked RFK, as do
some giant music festivals. As a sports stadium, RFK is home to the D.C.
United Major League Soccer club and the Washington Nationals Major
League Baseball team. A new baseball park was scheduled to open on
South Capitol Street on Capitol Hill in 2008. A new soccer field also was
being discussed, so some wonder what RFK’s future will look like.
Another site for mammoth events is FedEx Field (I-495 Exit 16, Maryland;
% 301-276-6000; www.redskins.com/fedexfield), which seats more
than 90,000 for Redskins games. It’s in the middle of nowhere, a mile from
the nearest Metrorail station, Morgan Boulevard.
Shaking Your Groove Thing: Dance Clubs
Do you wanna dance? If so, see the preceding section of this chapter for
details about Black Cat, where rockers go to dance as well as listen to
top-name performers. Then consider these other venues, where danc-
ing’s the thing.
As you may expect, Club Heaven & Hell (2327 18th St. NW, at Columbia
Road; % 202-667-4355) welcomes both angels and devils. Check your
wings and pitchforks at this door in Adams-Morgan. Here, it’s Heaven
that sizzles. It’s a loud dance hall on the upper level (of course) that 
features different styles of music on different nights, sometimes live,
sometimes DJ-generated. On weekends, the pearly gates don’t close until
3 a.m. (2 a.m. Sun–Thurs). Doors open at 7:30 p.m. Hell, downstairs, is a
dark bar with jukebox and pool table.
Another Adams-Morgan nightspot, Madam’s Organ (2461 18th St. NW,
south of Columbia Road; % 202-667-5370; www.madamsorgan.com) —
the owner likes puns — was once named one of the 25 best bars in
America by Playboy magazine. Madam’s has a varied musical menu, 
with shows starting between 9 and 10 p.m. On Monday, it’s funky jazz.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: D.C. Nightlife 
286

Wednesday it’s bluegrass (with local TV news anchor Doug McKelway
sometimes sitting in on banjo). On other nights, you might encounter
blues, R&B, jazz, reggae, salsa, merengue, and/or a magician. You can eat
sandwiches, snacks, and “soul food” here. Redheads get half price on
Rolling Rock. The second floor bar is called “Big Daddy’s Love Lounge &
Pick-Up Joint.” The place describes itself as a “blues bar and soul food
restaurant where the beautiful people go to get ugly.” If you want noise,
body heat, and dancing, Madam’s is the spot for you. Or you can go out-
side on the roof deck to cool off — or order something from the tiki bar!
Madam’s is open Sunday through Thursday from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. and
Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. Cover usually is between $3
and $7.
Platinum (915 F St. NW, between 9th and 10th streets; % 202-393-3555;
www.platinumclubdc.com) is an upscale club with three dance floors
where the young and beautiful move to varied music. Check the Web site
for what’s playing when you want to go. Platinum has a VIP lounge that
takes table reservations and expects you to spend a lot on liquid refresh-
ments. It’s open 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday, and 9 p.m.
to 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, usually with a $10 to $20 cover. Admission is free
before 11 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday if you register first on the Web site.
If you’d like a view with your dancing, salsa on down to Zanzibar (700
Water St. SW, between 7th and 8th streets; % 202-554-9100; www.
zanzibar-otw.com). Actually, you’d best take a cab. This large, popular
dance club comes with picture windows that look out onto the boats
tied up in the Washington Channel. You can cool down on outdoor decks
during nice weather. Inside, year-round, the club sports multiple rooms,
bars, and dance floors on several levels. A fair number of tables and
comfortable seating are situated around the place. This club draws an
international, integrated clientele — especially Latin Americans and
those who like to dance to Latin music. Hours, special programs, and
cover charges vary. Call or check the Web site for details.
Hanging Out: D.C.’s Best Bars
After a rough day of sightseeing, kicking back with your favorite aperitif
can be therapeutic.
If you’re looking for a romantic spot where you can share some quiet
music with someone special, settle into the Blue Bar at the Henley Park
Hotel (926 Massachusetts Ave. NW, west of 9th Street; % 202-638-5200)
at the northwest edge of Penn Quarter. A pianist performs Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday evenings. The bar is softly lighted and is comprised
of a collection of cubicle-like spaces that enable you and your compan-
ion to feel a sense of privacy while you listen to the music. The bar has
no cover charge. The bar opens at 11:30 a.m. daily and closes at mid-
night Sunday through Thursday and 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. A light
menu is available.
Chapter 16: Bars, Stars, and Gee-tars: D.C. at Night 287

The well-worn comfort of the Tabard Inn (1739 N St. NW, between 17th
and 18th streets; % 202-833-2668; www.tabardinn.com/rest.htm)
near Dupont Circle makes it a perfect spot for a drink all year. It’s even
better in the winter, when you can cozy up to the fireplace. Every
Sunday, live jazz plays from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. The Old Ebbitt Grill (675
15th St. NW, between F and G streets; % 202-347-4800) has the feel of 
an old-fashioned men’s club, and as the evening wears on, that feeling
grows. This downtown tavern is big and has multiple bars, so you ought
to be able to find a spot that satisfies you. You have lots of choices in the
nibbles department as well. The lounge at Zola (800 F St. NW; % 202-654-
0999), with floor-to-ceiling windows looking at the street action in the
Penn Quarter arts and entertainment district, is a highly popular spot for
after-work unwinding. Zola prints an innovative cocktail and wine list. It
closes at 10 p.m. Sunday and at midnight the rest of the week.
Enjoy a panoramic view of Washington with your cocktail at the Sky
Terrace atop the Hotel Washington (515 15th St. NW, at Pennsylvania
Avenue; % 202-638-5900), just a block from the White House. From April
through October, weather willing, this outdoor restaurant is a wonderful
vantage point for watching the sun set over the city or the lights come
on at D.C.’s landmarks. You can order a meal or just get a drink until
12:30 a.m. daily.
For a beer with some atmosphere, drop in at a longtime Georgetown
hangout. Clyde’s (3236 M St. NW, between Wisconsin Avenue and
Potomac Street; % 202-333-9180) has helped to define eating and drink-
ing in Georgetown since 1963. A 1996 renovation replaced much of its
old-time-tavern atmosphere with the appearance of your typical, late-
20th-century, family-friendly theme bar (airplane models dangling from
the ceiling in one room, for example). But it’s still a comfortable spot for
a beer and a burger — whether bar munchies or a full meal. Clyde’s is
open Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. until midnight, Friday
11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. until
midnight.
If you prefer that worn, college-bar mystique, stroll east on M Street for
about 2 blocks to Garrett’s (3003 M St. NW, at 30th Street; % 202-333-
1033; www.garrettsdc.com) where the street-level bar will remind you of
some place where you drank and dug the jukebox in your past — except
that this jukebox is linked to the Internet and has a near-limitless selection
of songs. Listen, there’s Bob Dylan spittin’ out “Rainy Day Woman” like it’s
1966. Upstairs you find two more bars, a golf game, and a nice little restau-
rant. It’s open Monday through Thursday 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., Friday
and Saturday noon to 2:30 a.m., Sunday noon to 1:30 a.m.
Georgetown’s main college bar is The Tombs (1226 36th St. NW, at
Prospect Street; % 202-337-6668), which occupies the basement of 
a mid-19th-century house at the edge of the Georgetown University
campus. Students, faculty, and other neighborhood residents frequent
this comfortable, attractive pub, which once counted a young Bill
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: D.C. Nightlife 
288

Clinton among its regulars. The food is unusually good for a college
hangout because of its relationship with the excellent 1789 Restaurant
upstairs. The Tombs is open Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m.
to 1:15 a.m., Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:15 a.m., Saturday from 11 a.m. to
2:15 a.m., and Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 1:15 a.m.
Going International: Latin, Irish, 
and Russian Hot Spots
Want to add a little international flavor to your Washington nightlife? If
your tastes run to dancing and things Latin, you’ll enjoy Zanzibar,
described earlier in this chapter. If you’re interested in Latin dancing 
lessons, check when they’re being offered at Habana Village (1834
Columbia Rd. NW, between Biltmore Street and Belmont Road; % 202-
462-6310), an Adams-Morgan nightspot where salsa and merengue are
big Wednesday and Thursday from 6:30 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Friday and
Saturday till 2:30 a.m. The Chi Cha Lounge (1624 U St. NW, between 16th
and 17th streets; % 202-234-8400) entertains with Latin drinks, music,
and tapas. Oh, and also water pipes — but for smoking tobacco only. 
Chi Cha has a $15 minimum and is open Sunday through Thursday from
5:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., and Friday and Saturday till 2:30 a.m.
The Irish have been influential in American politics for a long time, so it
stands to reason that America’s capital would have its share of Irish
pubs. On Capitol Hill, side-by-side competition occurs between the
Dubliner (4 F St. NW, at North Capitol Street; % 202-737-3773; www.
dublinerdc.com) and Kelly’s Irish Times Pub (14 F St. NW, between
North Capitol Street and New Jersey Avenue; % 202-543-5433). Both
spots parcel out Irish beer, Irish food, and live Irish music. Both offer
sidewalk tables in nice weather. You find lots of Capitol Hill denizens
here — congressional staffers, journalists, lobbyists, and the occasional
legislator. The Times also attracts 20-somethings with a pop jukebox 
in the basement and is open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to
1:30 a.m. and Friday and Saturday until 2:30 a.m. Live music starts Friday
and Saturday at 10 p.m. The Dubliner is open daily from 11 a.m. until the
crowd thins out after midnight. Live music starts at 9 p.m. Monday
through Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday.
Pretend you’re part of the post-Soviet oligarchy at Russia House
Restaurant and Lounge (1800 Connecticut Ave. N.W., at S Street; % 202-
234-9433; www.russiahouselounge.com). This is truly a remarkable
spot, spun out of an organization founded to promote U.S.-Russia busi-
ness. The décor is elegant, designed to evoke the era of the czars. There
are, of course, large selections of vodkas, Russian beers and caviars. You
can order a full Russian meal in the restaurant.

Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
The best comedy in Washington is homegrown. The Capitol Steps
(www.capsteps.com) did, in fact, blossom on the Capitol steps.
Congressional staffers with talent saw the humor around them and
turned it into an enduring musical act. (Motto: “We put the mock in
democracy.”) I’m talking about songs like “It’s a Whole Newt World,”
“Send in the Clones,” “Don’t Cry for Me, Judge Scalia,” “Enron-Ron-Ron,”
and “Papa’s Got a Brand New Baghdad.” Following defeat of the Senate
Democratic leader in the 2004 election, the Steps penned “Hang Down
Your Head, Tom Daschle.” Following the Democratic resurgence in 2006,
they came up with “Springtime for Liberals” (to the tune of “Springtime
for Hitler” from The Producers) and “Everything’s Run by Pelosi”
(“Everything’s Coming up Roses”). They’ve been doing this act since 
the early ’80s (“The Wreck of the Walter Fritz Mondale,” “Dutch, the
Magic Reagan”). Now, they have a regular gig every Friday and Saturday
at 7:30 p.m. in the amphitheater of (don’t you love irony?) the Ronald
Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, between 13th and 14th
streets. You can purchase the $35 tickets from Ticketmaster (% 800-
551-7328 or 202-397-7328; www.ticketmaster.com), at the Ticketmaster
outlet at the D.C. Visitor Information Center in the Reagan Building or at
the door after 6 p.m. on the night of the performance.
Headliners on the national comedy club circuit (and subheadliners, too,
if the truth be known) perform at The Improv (1140 Connecticut Ave.
NW, between L and M streets; % 202-296-7008; www.dcimprov.com).
Ellen DeGeneres, Jerry Seinfeld, and Robin Williams have performed
here. So have a whole bunch of people I’ve never heard of, supposedly
with Comedy Central credentials. (Where does Tony Rock, Chris’s
younger brother, fit in?) Drinks and light meals are available. Show times
are Tuesday through Thursday at 8:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 8 and
10:30 p.m., and Sunday at 8 p.m. The cover varies with the lineup, and
there’s also a two-item (food or drink) minimum. You can make reserva-
tions in person at the box office, by phone, or from the Web site. You
must be age 18 to enter.
Painting the Town Rainbow: 
The Gay and Lesbian Scene
Gays’ full participation in the Washington community is only half
reflected in the city’s nightlife. There is a large and varied collection of
night spots for gay men, but just one dedicated to women — although
many attract both sexes. As you might expect, Dupont Circle has the
most gay-oriented night spots, but gay-focused clubs are scattered
throughout the city. Some attract a substantial straight clientele as well.
Among the most popular is JR’s Bar and Grill (1519 17th St. NW,
between P and Q streets; % 202-328-0090; www.jrswdc.com). The bar
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: D.C. Nightlife 
290

draws upscale gay men and has a big-screen TV at the bar and pool
tables on the balcony. JR’s is open Sunday through Thursday from 4 p.m.
to 2 a.m. and Friday and Saturday from 2 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Also attracting gay men in Dupont Circle is Omega DC (2122 P St. NW,
between 21st Street and Twining Court, entrance off Twining Court; 
% 202-223-4917), which scatters parties over two floors with several
rooms. There’s a piano bar, a cigar/martini bar, two more bars, a pool
table, and a 60-inch video screen. Omega DC is open Sunday from 7 p.m.
to 2 a.m., Monday through Thursday from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday from 
4 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Saturday from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Halo (1435 P St. NW, between 14th and 15th streets; % 202-797-9730;
www.halodc.com), about 41⁄2 blocks from Dupont Circle, is one of D.C.’s
newest and most popular night spots for gay men and women. Named
Washington’s best gay and lesbian bar by voters in the 2005 Washington
Post online readers’ poll — and best neighborhood bar, best place to
meet men, and best happy hour by The Washington Blade in 2006 — Halo
actually attracts neighborhood residents of all orientations. They come
to this comfortable place to relax, talk, eat, and sip cocktails. Halo is
open Monday through Thursday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday and Saturday 
5 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Sunday 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Capitol Hill boasts Remington’s (639 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, between 6th
and 7th streets; % 202-543-3113; www.remingtonswdc.com), a country-
western bar that offers Western dance lessons and attracts mostly gay
men. It’s open Monday to Thursday from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday and
Saturday from 4 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Sunday from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Mr. Henry’s (601 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, at 6th Street; % 202-546-8412)
lures a mixed gay/straight clientele for meals and for jazz Friday nights
on the second floor. This Capitol Hill institution is open Monday through
Saturday 11:15 a.m. until midnight and Sunday 10 a.m. until midnight.
There’s an $8 minimum to hear jazz on the second floor from 8:30 p.m.
Friday.
Capitol Hill also is home for Washington’s oldest bar for lesbians, Phase
One (525 8th St. SE, between F and G streets; % 202-544-6831). Like
Halo, this is a comfortable neighborhood bar. It’s got a pool table and
small dance floor and attracts gay women of all ages. It’s open Thursday
from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday and Saturday till 3 a.m. There’s live music
Thursday nights.
Noting the paucity of night spots specifically for lesbians, Bridget
Hieronymus has created A Different Kind of Ladies Night. Actually, it’s
“nights.” These essentially are happy hours for women that Hieronymus
organizes frequently in various bars around town. She describes her
goal as replicating a “hip, funky, martini-type bar where women could sit
around and actually talk and mingle and have a drink.” Venues agree to
offer drink specials and charge no cover. To find the next gathering,
check her Web site www.adifferentkindofladiesnight.com.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
A
h, tradition. The Part of Tens is to For Dummies books
what monument hopping is to Washington — essential.
In this part, I list the top ten views in D.C. and the top ten rea-
sons to (gulp) drive around the city.

Chapter 17
Top Ten D.C. Views
In This Chapter
 Discovering great places to see D.C. in all its splendor
 Looking from the monuments instead of at them
 Climbing to high spots that overlook the city
 Finding scenic spots for panorama photos
T
he monuments, monumental buildings, memorials, parks, fountains,
and flowers make Washington a stunning city to look at. If you flew
down the Potomac River into National Airport, you’ve already seen the
most impressive view. Here are ten others. Don’t forget your camera.
Washington Monument
It’s pretty widely agreed that the best view of Washington — that doesn’t
come from a flying machine — comes from the top of the Washington
Monument (between Constitution Avenue NW, Independence Avenue
SW, and 15th and 17th streets; % 202-426-6841; www.nps.gov/wamo;
advance tickets 800-967-2283 or http://reservations.nps.gov). You
take the fast elevator to the top, wander from window to window to get 
a panoramic view, then ride down more slowly so you can take a gander
at the monument’s interior. The elevator runs daily 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.
The monument’s closed December 25. See the monument’s listing in
Chapter 11 for details on getting tickets.
Old Post Office Tower
Ride the elevator to the top of the Old Post Office Tower (Pennsylvania
Avenue NW at 11th Street; % 202-606-8694; www.nps.gov/opot). From
the observation deck, 270 feet above the street, you can see a view of
downtown and beyond. Many people think this view is second only to
the vista from the Washington Monument (see preceding section).
While you’re here, take a look at the interior workings of the tower clock
and bells and visit the ninth-floor exhibit room. The tower is open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and weekends and holi-
days 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. From the first weekend in June through Labor

Day, it stays open till 7:45 p.m. Monday through Friday. Because the
observation deck is exposed to the elements, the tower may close in 
bad weather.
Arlington National Cemetery
When you ride the Tourmobile through Arlington National Cemetery
(% 703-607-8052; www.arlingtoncemetery.org), be sure to get off 
at Arlington House and walk around. One of the best panoramas of
Washington is viewed from the lawn here or from Pierre L’Enfant’s 
grave below the house. (For details on riding the Tourmobile through
Arlington, see Chapter 11.)
Washington National Cathedral
Washington’s highest points above sea level are the towers of the
Washington National Cathedral (Massachusetts and Wisconsin avenues
NW; % 202-537-6200; www.cathedral.org/cathedral), so the views
from those spots are among the best in the city. Unfortunately, tourists
can’t go all the way to the top. But the view from the Pilgrim Observation
Gallery is still pretty cool. One way to partake of that view is to have tea
in the gallery. (See Chapter 10 for information on making reservations.) 
Or you can visit on your own from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through
Friday (till 7:45 p.m. June–Labor Day), 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday, and 
8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Sunday. See the Cathedral’s listing in Chapter 11 for
details.
Lincoln Memorial
Take a break from reading the Gettysburg Address on the wall and 
gaze at the Reflecting Pool, the Mall, the World War II Memorial, the
Washington Monument, and the Capitol from the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial (23rd Street NW, between Constitution and Independence
avenues, on the National Mall; % 202-426-6841; www.nps.gov/linc).
Then walk around to the back of Lincoln’s place for a view across the
Potomac River of Arlington National Cemetery and the eternal flame
marking John F. Kennedy’s grave. The Lincoln Memorial is always open,
and the view is particularly impressive after dark. See Chapter 11 for
more details.
Jefferson Memorial
One of the reasons the Jefferson Memorial (East Basin Drive SW, on
southeast side of Tidal Basin; % 202-426-6841; www.nps.gov/thje)
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
298

is my favorite is the marvelous view here in spring, when the cherry
blossoms color the land around the Tidal Basin, and after dark year-
round, when Washington’s many alabaster buildings and monuments
gleam in their floodlights. Especially prominent is the White House,
where Jefferson once lived, and the monument to his fellow revolution-
ary and president, George Washington.
Roof Terrace of the Kennedy Center
You don’t need orchestra seats to visit the Kennedy Center (2700 F St.
NW, between New Hampshire Avenue and Rock Creek Parkway; % 800-
444-1324 or 202-467-4600; www.kennedy-center.org). In fact, one of
the best shows in town plays night and day, and it’s free. Although you
may want to dine in the Roof Terrace Restaurant (reservations % 202-
416-8555) or the KC Cafe (no reservations), which also is located on the
roof terrace level, you can feast on the view from the promenade outside
the restaurants without spending a cent. Circle the promenade once for
a 360-degree vista. The center is open daily from 10 a.m. until 30 minutes
after the last performance. See Chapter 15 for more details.
Sky Terrace
Come to this open-air rooftop restaurant for the view, not the food. If
you do eat at the Sky Terrace (in the Hotel Washington, 515 15th St. NW,
at Pennsylvania Avenue; % 202-638-5900), pick something simple, like a
sandwich. Or just have a drink. You’re here for the bird’s-eye view of the
White House at the next block and the rest of Washington further into
the distance. Arrive by 5:30 p.m. if you want to beat out the locals and
other tourists for a seat. The Sky Terrace is open daily 11:30 a.m. to
12:30 a.m. late April to mid-October.
Washington Harbour
Walk along the riverfront promenade at Washington Harbour, below K
Street at Thomas Jefferson Street in Georgetown, and gaze across the
Potomac toward Virginia. Dead ahead is Theodore Roosevelt Island. To
the left, you can make out the Watergate and, beyond it, the Kennedy
Center. To the right, Key Bridge connects Georgetown with Arlington,
Virginia. If you’re so moved, grab an outdoor seat at one of the harbor’s
restaurants and have a sip or a snack.
Chapter 17: Top Ten D.C. Views 299

West Front of the Capitol
One of the many victims of increased D.C. security is the marvelous view
from the steps and terrace on the West Front of the Capitol. It’s one of
the best places to watch the sun set over the Washington Monument,
Lincoln Memorial, and Potomac River. Seeing Washington’s marble land-
marks bathed in golden light, with purple and pink streaking the sky
over the Potomac, is an awesome sight. The view at others times of the
day and after dark ain’t too shabby either. Now you can catch a glimpse
of that view when you take a Capitol tour. Or you can walk across the
West Lawn to the base of the steps and check out a lower-level perspec-
tive. (See the Capitol’s listing in Chapter 11 for touring information.)

Chapter 18
If You Must Drive: Ten D.C.
Roadside Attractions
In This Chapter
 Finding the places worth the drive
 Discovering parks away from the Mall
 Sightseeing along the parkway
 Figuring out how to get there from here
I
know: If you’ve read any other chapter in this book, you’ve seen my
repeated warnings that you should not drive in Washington. This
chapter, though, goes contrary to that advice because I’m actually giving
you ten reasons to drive. I’ll just call this chapter — as members of
Congress do in the Congressional Record — a revision and extension of
my remarks. If you happen to have a car, you can find some sights that
are worth driving to. I’m not really advocating that you drive in central
D.C. but encouraging you to use your car to reach sights and attractions
that are mostly outside the District.
National Arboretum
The best time to visit the National Arboretum (3501 New York Ave. NE,
east of Bladensberg Road; % 202-245-2726; www.usna.usda.gov) is from
late April into late May, when the azaleas are in full riot, and crabapples,
dogwoods, peonies, roses, and irises also bloom. If you can’t make it
during that timeframe, though, don’t worry: The National Arboretum
always has something to see, such as magnolias in early spring and holly
berries in winter. Some man-made items will grab your attention as well,
such as 22 sandstone columns that were removed from the East Portico of
the Capitol during a renovation and now stand like an ancient ruin in the
arboretum.
This 446-acre site is a research and educational facility of the Agricultural
Department’s Research Service. Stop at the Administration Building to
pick up a map and guide, and to find out what’s blooming.

If the azaleas are in flower, you have to drive Azalea Road. You won’t
believe the cascade of colors! Pack a picnic.
From downtown D.C., go northeast on New York Avenue all the way to
the arboretum’s entrance (to the right). Watch carefully for the sign after
you cross the big Bladensberg Road intersection. Returning to down-
town is trickier because of traffic patterns. I suggest using the R Street
exit from the arboretum, which is near the Administration Building. Turn
left on Bladensburg and then right on Maryland Avenue, which carries
you right to the Capitol. Watch out for the jog around Stanton Park
Square at 6th and C streets. Arboretum grounds are open daily (except
Dec 25) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.
Clara Barton National Historic Site
Hard as it is to believe, when Clara Barton’s last home (5801 Oxford Rd.,
Glen Echo, Maryland, southwest of Macarthur Boulevard; % 301-320-
1410; www.nps.gov/clba) became part of the National Park Service in
1975, it was the first National Historic Site dedicated to the accomplish-
ments of a woman. The founder of the American Red Cross lived here
from February 28, 1897, until she died in her bedroom on April 12, 1912,
at the age of 90. Until she resigned as Red Cross president in 1904, her
residence was also the Red Cross headquarters and a warehouse for dis-
aster supplies.
To reach the site, go west on M Street out of Georgetown, then turn left
on Canal Road, which becomes Clara Barton Parkway. Then follow the
signs to the Clara Barton National Historic Site. The interior of the house
is shown by guided tour daily on the hour, with the first tour at 10 a.m.
and the last tour at 4 p.m. (closed Thanksgiving, Dec 25, and Jan 1).
Admission is free.
Because of traffic patterns, the easiest way to return to D.C. is to follow
Macarthur Boulevard till it ends at Foxhall Road. Bear right on Foxhall,
then turn left where Foxhall ends at Canal Road, and you’ll be on your
way into Georgetown.
Don’t leave Washington before 9:30 a.m. weekdays, when a portion of
Canal Road is inbound only.
Glen Echo Park
The National Park Service and a lot of volunteers have worked magic at
Glen Echo Park (7300 Macarthur Blvd., Glen Echo, Maryland, at Oxford
Road; % 301-320-1400, recorded information 301-634-2222; www.glen
echopark.org and www.nps.gov/glec), which stands essentially next
door to Clara Barton’s house. Glen Echo is an abandoned amusement
park that operated from about 1900 to 1968. I used to describe it as a

very strange place. When I walked around here — especially in winter
when it’s deserted — I felt like an archaeologist exploring some reason-
ably well-preserved ruin: You see the remains of the swimming pool over
here, the abandoned bumper car pavilion over there . . .
But the restoration is proving wondrous. The centerpiece is a marvelous
working carousel — with 40 horses, 4 rabbits, 4 ostriches, 1 giraffe, 1
deer, 1 lion, 1 tiger, 2 circus chariots, more than 1,000 lights, and lots of
mirrors. Equally impressive is the Art Deco Spanish Ballroom, a large
dance hall filled with polished wood and looking as enticing as it must
have when it opened in 1933 and Swing was becoming king. Trolley cars,
like those that brought Washingtonians out to the amusement park, are
on display.
Glen Echo once again rings with the laughter of children who come here
for the many arts programs, puppet shows, and other performances —
and, of course, the carousel. Adults of all ages participate in many arts
programs as well, such as pottery classes. And the ballroom once again
fills with music during dances and dance classes. Most dances are pre-
ceded by an instruction period for beginners. Call or explore the Web
site for details on the many other activities.
The park grounds and parking lot are open daily 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., except
Thanksgiving and December 25. The carousel operates May and June
Wednesday and Thursday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday noon
to 6 p.m.; July and August Wednesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
Saturday and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.; September Saturday and Sunday
noon to 6 p.m. Park admission is free. Carousel tickets are $1. There are
fees for other activities. Bring a picnic.
To get to Glen Echo Park, follow the directions to Clara Barton’s house.
You can’t miss it: It’s the abandoned amusement park with the stone
tower and trolley cars parked out front!
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal 
National Historical Park
The C&O Canal National Historical Park (11710 Macarthur Blvd.,
Potomac, Maryland, at the end of the road; % 301-767-3714; www.nps.
gov/choh) actually stretches along the old canal from Georgetown to
Cumberland, Maryland. In this chapter, I’m talking about the section of
the park at the Great Falls of the Potomac River in Maryland. My family
comes here regularly to picnic, stroll the boardwalk out to the falls, and
hike along the canal and into the bordering hills. The setting is beautiful.
You can brush up on your history at the visitor center in the old Great
Falls Tavern, which served canal boat passengers. You can bring a picnic
or buy simple foods at the park refreshment stand. From early April till
the end of October, you can take an hour-long ride on a replica of a canal
Part VI: The Part of Tens

boat. July through August, the boat floats Wednesday through Friday at
11 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday a 4:30 p.m. ride is
added. April through June, and September and October, the trips start
Wednesday through Friday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., Saturday and Sunday
also at 1:30 p.m. Tickets cost $2.
To get to Great Falls, follow the directions to Clara Barton’s house (see the
section “Clara Barton National Historic Site,” earlier in this chapter), but
stay on the Clara Barton Parkway until it ends at Macarthur Boulevard.
Follow Macarthur to the left until it ends in the park.
The park is open daily during daylight hours, and the visitor center oper-
ates daily from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Park and center close Thanksgiving,
December 25, and January 1. Admission is $5 per vehicle for a three-day
pass, $3 per individual who comes by bike or walking.
Great Falls Park
Directly across the Potomac River from the C&O Canal Park’s Great 
Falls area is Virginia’s Great Falls Park (9200 Old Dominion Dr., McLean,
Virginia, at Georgetown Pike; % 703-285-2965; www.nps.gov/grfa). You
see the same falls from the opposite side, can picnic and hike, and can
check out some additional history at Virginia’s park. A substantial visitor
center offers history and nature exhibits. Before he presided over the suc-
cessful launch of a new nation, George Washington presided over a failed
attempt to build a canal on this side of the Potomac. Remnants are visible.
Go west on M Street out of Georgetown, left on Canal Road, left over Chain
Bridge, right on Virginia Route 123 (Chain Bridge Road), and then right on
Virginia Route 193 (Georgetown Pike). Turn right at Old Dominion Drive at
the sign to the park.
The park is open daily from 7 a.m. until dark. The visitor center is open
daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and stays open somewhat later in spring and
summer. Admission is $5 per vehicle for a three-day pass, $3 per individ-
ual who comes by bike, horseback, or walking. There are riding trails in
the park, but it’s BYOH (bring your own horse).
Wolf Trap
The name here says it all: Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts
(1551 Trap Rd., Vienna, Virginia, off the Wolf Trap exit from the Dulles Toll
Road; % 703-255-1800; www.nps.gov/wotr). At the Filene Center — a
roofed, open-air theater with outdoor lawn seating as well — big-name
artists perform before audiences of up to 7,000 from May through
September. The Meadow Pavilion and the Theatre in the Woods host
workshops in theater and other arts and crafts. Performances are held
throughout the year in the Barns of Wolf Trap, a 352-seat indoor theater
built in two restored 18th-century barns.
Chapter 18: If You Must Drive: Ten D.C. Roadside Attractions 305

The word eclectic was created to describe Wolf Trap’s performance
schedule: the National Symphony Orchestra, the Wolf Trap Opera, pop,
rock, country, folk, Broadway musicals, operettas, and lots of stuff for
kids and for aging boomers. It’s becoming a summer tradition for my
sister and her husband to come for a visit that includes a trip to Wolf Trap
for some ’50s/’60s/’70s group that’s still keeping the candle burning —
the Kingston Trio, the Doobie Brothers, the Beach Boys, or Brian Wilson
on his “Smile” tour. Peter, Paul, and Mary have performed here several
times. We used to take Julie here for kids festivals. Most recently, she
thought it would be fun to come for the Mikado. (She was right!) Wolf
Trap has a restaurant (reservations are strongly advised), refreshment
stand, and lots of space for picnicking — and holding festivals — on 
the 117 acres of farm and forest land. You can bring your own food and
drink, including alcoholic beverages, but you can’t take them inside the
roofed part of the theater. To find out which performances might appeal
to you, phone % 703-255-1868 or surf to www.wolf-trap.org.
Drive west on Constitution Avenue to westbound I-66. Watch for signs to
Virginia Route 267 local exits (the Dulles Toll Road). After you’re on 267,
watch for signs to Wolf Trap. Admission to the park is free. Fees for per-
formances vary.
Don’t get on the toll-free Dulles Access Highway, which is restricted to 
airport traffic. There’s no exit before the airport, and you can be fined if
you’re caught using the highway for anything other than airport business.
Theodore Roosevelt Island
This little island in the middle of the Potomac River is a memorial to the
26th president’s history as an outdoorsman and advocate of conserva-
tion. Theodore Roosevelt Island National Memorial (George Washington
Memorial Parkway; % 703-289-2500; www.nps.gov/this) contains 91
acres of woods, 2.5 miles of trails, and a memorial plaza with an outsized
statue of Roosevelt. It’s a pleasant respite that’s actually inside the city
limits. It also helps to dramatically illustrate how the Republican Party
has changed since it was led by this man, who arguably was our most
environmentalist president. In 2005, the Republican chairman of the
House Resources Committee proposed selling it to developers! He didn’t
succeed.
Drive west on Constitution Avenue and continue straight across the
Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge to the George Washington Memorial
Parkway (northbound). The Roosevelt Island parking lot is to your right
immediately after you enter the parkway. Don’t miss it! The only entrance
is from the northbound lanes. The park is open daily from dawn to dusk,
and admission is free.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
306

George Washington Memorial Parkway
You can explore numerous interesting places along the George
Washington Memorial Parkway (% 703-289-2500; www.nps.gov/gwmp;
e-mail: gwnp_superintendent@nps.gov; mailing address: George
Washington Memorial Parkway Headquarters, Turkey Run Park, McLean,
VA 22101), which runs along the south and west bank of the Potomac
River from I-495 northwest of D.C. to Mount Vernon. Write, phone, or
e-mail parkway headquarters before your visit to ask for a map/brochure
to be mailed to you. Otherwise, look for it at National Park Service facili-
ties along the parkway. You also can ask whether parkway brochures are
available at other park service sites you visit in the Washington area.
Here are some spots worth a stop along the parkway:
 Turkey Run: Explore 700 acres of forest and hiking trails.
 Dyke Marsh: This 380 acres of tidal marsh, floodplain, and swamp
forest comprises the largest remaining freshwater tidal wetlands in
the Washington Metropolitan area and attracts bird-watchers.
 Fort Hunt: Batteries here guarded the river approach to Washington
from 1898 to 1918.
 Fort Marcy: The earthwork remnant is just one example of the
many forts that surrounded Washington during the Civil War.
 Netherlands Carillon: The 50-bell, 127-foot-tall carillon was 
given by the Dutch to express gratitude to the United States after
World War II. The bells strike the hour daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Carillonneurs present concerts Saturdays and national holidays
from 2 to 4 p.m. in May and September and 6 to 8 p.m. in June, July,
and August. During concerts, visitors are welcome to go up in the
tower to watch the carillonneur perform. Automated concerts
occur daily at noon and 6 p.m. On May 5, Dutch Independence Day,
you hear “The Netherlands’ National Anthem.” On July 4, by act 
of Congress, the largest bell tolls 13 times at 2 p.m. Patriotic songs
are played at 9:04 a.m. September 2, the moment the Japanese
armistice ended World War II. At 6 p.m. New Year’s Eve, you can
toast to “Auld Lang Syne.” (A bit early, don’t you think?)
 Marine Corps Memorial: This oversized sculpture of the famous
World War II photograph, by Joe Rosenthal, shows Marines raising
the U.S. flag during the battle for Iwo Jima.
 Gravelly Point: This is a popular spot for watching airplanes take
off and land at National Airport. If you have a boat, put it in the
Potomac here and view Washington’s landmarks from the water.
The parkway also provides access to Arlington National Cemetery (see
Chapter 11 for details), Mount Vernon (see Chapter 14), and Theodore
Roosevelt Island (see earlier in this chapter). At Alexandria, the parkway
runs through the city as Washington Street.
Chapter 18: If You Must Drive: Ten D.C. Roadside Attractions 307

From D.C., drive west on Constitution Avenue and continue straight
across the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge to the George
Washington Memorial Parkway (northbound). Or drive west on
Independence Avenue; as you pass the Lincoln Memorial, watch closely
for signs to the Arlington Memorial Bridge. After you cross the bridge,
turn right out of the traffic circle and then exit left to continue south-
bound or go straight to go northbound. The southbound route also is
marked to National Airport.
Do not sightsee along the parkway during rush hour. This road is a major
commuter artery on weekdays. Drive here on the weekend or from mid-
morning until mid-afternoon during the week. Also note: Some spots are
accessible only from the northbound or southbound lanes.
Rock Creek Park
This marvelous urban park (% 202-895-6070; www.nps.gov/rocr; mail-
ing address: 3545 Williamsburg Lane NW, Washington, DC 20008) winds
its way from the Potomac River near the Kennedy Center all the way up
to D.C.’s most northern tip. Write or phone the park headquarters before
your visit to request a map/brochure. In the park, you can find informa-
tion desks and activities at the following locations:
 The Nature Center (5200 Glover Rd. NW, south of Military Road;
www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/naturecenter.htm) is open
Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is closed
Thanksgiving, December 25, January 1, and July 4. The Nature
Center features exhibits on plants, animals, and habitats in the
park. It’s the starting point for guided and self-guided nature walks.
The hands-on Discovery room appeals to youngsters, as does the
planetarium’s kid-oriented shows on Wednesdays at 4 p.m. Other
planetarium presentations occur Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 
4 p.m. Restrooms are available.
 Peirce Barn (Tilden Street at Beach Drive) is open weekends from
noon to 4 p.m. Programs here tell about nearby Peirce Mill, an
early-19th-century water-powered grist mill that is closed for
repairs. Restrooms are available.
You can also ask for the Rock Creek Park brochure and map at other
National Park Service sites in the Washington area.
The park offers a wide range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, horse-
back riding, bicycling, picnicking, golf, tennis, and boating. The Nature
Center, Planetarium, and Peirce Barn conduct numerous programs for
children. The 4,000-seat Carter Barron Amphitheatre (16th Street and
Colorado Avenue NW; % 202-426-0486; www.nps.gov/rocr/cbarron)
hosts numerous outdoor performances, both paid and free, including
free summer concerts by the National Symphony Orchestra and free
plays by the Shakespeare Theatre.

Rock Creek Park Area
Chapter 18: If You Must Drive: Ten D.C. Roadside Attractions 309

To enter the park from central D.C., drive northwest on Virginia Avenue
to Rock Creek Parkway and turn right.
Rock Creek Parkway and Beach Drive are major commuter routes during
workday rush hours. South of Connecticut Avenue, the parkway is one-
way south from 6:45 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Monday through Friday and one-
way north from 3:45 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. those days. On weekends and
holidays, portions of Beach Drive are clogged with a different kind of
traffic — bicyclists, in-line skaters, walkers, and runners. The drive is
closed to motor vehicles from Broad Branch Road to Military Road, from
Picnic Grove 10 to Wise Road, and from West Beach Drive to the D.C.-
Maryland border from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on holidays and from 7 a.m.
Saturday until 7 p.m. Sunday on weekends.
National Air and Space Museum 
Steven F. Udvar–Hazy Center
You can fit only so many flying machines into a building in the middle of
Washington, so the Air and Space Museum decided to expand out into
the countryside — in a corner of Washington Dulles International Airport,
about 25 miles away, to be exact. The product of this expansion is the
Steven F. Udvar–Hazy Center (14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway,
Chantilly, Virginia, off Virginia Route 28, south of the airport’s main
entrance; % 202-633-1000; www.nasm.si.edu/museum/udvarhazy), an
enormous structure that opened in late 2003 and nearly quintupled the
museum’s display space.
There’s now plenty of room for such large artifacts as the Enola Gay, 
the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb; the Space
Shuttle Enterprise, the first shuttle, which was used in tests; and the 
SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane, the fastest and highest-flying jet
aircraft ever built, with a top speed of more than 2,200 mph at altitudes
exceeding 85,000 feet. About 270 aircraft and spacecraft now call Udvar-
Hazy home, as do more than 1,500 smaller items. It also has an aircraft
control tower, flight simulators, and a giant-screen IMAX Theatre.
Knowledgeable docents enrich the visitor’s experience by explaining dis-
plays and answering questions. You’ll spend one to two hours here —
more if you really study the exhibits.
Drive west on Constitution Avenue to westbound I-66. Watch for signs to
Virginia Route 267 local exits (the Dulles Toll Road). Just before you get
to the airport, take Exit 9A to Virginia Route 28, and then drive south 
31⁄2 miles to the Air and Space Museum Parkway. Follow signs to the
museum. Admission is free, but you’ll pay $12 for on-site parking. IMAX
tickets cost $8.50 to $10. Phone % 877-932-4629 for information about
the films. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., except
December 25.

If you’re calling a D.C. number from outside
D.C., dial 202. If you’re in D.C. and calling
D.C., no area code is needed. Dial 703 for
suburban Virginia. For most close-in
Maryland suburbs, dial 301. Annapolis and
Baltimore are 410, and some 443 area

ATMs
It’s hard to walk a block in D.C. without
encountering an ATM. They’re located in

front desk. White House Nannies (% 301-
652-8088 or 800-266-9024; www.white
housenannies.com) sends sitters to
hotels on short notice. Reserving ahead 
of time saves you money.
Business Hours
D.C. banks tend to be open from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Monday through Friday, with some
opening on Saturday morning. It’s really
impossible to talk about typical hours for
stores anymore. Most will open by 10 a.m.
and not close before 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Many are open into the
evening and on Saturday, and some open
Sunday afternoon. You’ll tend to find more
stores open at night in areas with substan-
tial nightlife, such as Georgetown.

Restrooms
One of the great things about being a
tourist in Washington is that you’re never
far from clean, safe, and free restrooms —
a particular benefit when you’re traveling
with young children. You can find them in
all the government buildings, all the
Smithsonian museums, the major monu-
ments, and the larger food courts. One
place you won’t find them easily is inside
the Metrorail system. In a truly extreme
emergency, ask a Metrorail station atten-
dant to let you use the station facility. Most
stations have restrooms that are supposed
to be available to the public on request, but
Metrorail resists wide use.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 313

Safety
Like any big city, Washington has street
crime. Luckily for you, the areas most 
frequented by tourists are the safest. Post-
9/11 concerns have heightened govern-
ments’ attention to security, especially
around government buildings, monuments,
museums, Metrorail, and other places
where large numbers of visitors are likely
to gather. In Adams-Morgan, the U Street
Corridor, and on Capitol Hill at night, stick
to the well-lighted, highly populated, main
commercial blocks. In fact, it’s best to stay
out of dark, deserted places all over town.
The Mall used to feel safe round the clock,
but a couple of well-publicized muggings
after dark in 2006 challenged that compla-
cency. If Metro’s service has stopped for
the night, and you still are out on the town,
take a taxi. Know your destination before
you get out of the cab. Hold your kids’
hands on city streets and sidewalks, on all
Metro escalators, and on Metro platforms.
Lock your hotel room door, car doors, and
trunk. Don’t leave luggage or other items
visible in your car when you park it. Lock
valuables in a hotel safe deposit box (if not
in your room, at the front desk). Keep a
tight hold on your pocketbook and camera.
Hold onto your purse in a restaurant. Carry
your cash and credit cards in a front pocket
or a concealed money pouch. Leave the
family jewels at home; what you do bring,
don’t flash. Don’t leave a purse or other
bag unattended in public. Not only might
you lose it to a purse snatcher, you might
lose it to law enforcement officials who
worry there might be a bomb inside.
Smoking
By law, Washington’s restaurants and bars
now are smoke-free, except for cigar and
hookah bars and outdoor areas such as
sidewalk cafes. The ban also covers
offices and apartment building lobbies. The
law allows you to smoke in your hotel
room. Establishments, of course, are free
to impose stricter limitations of their own,
and smoke-free hotel rooms have become
pretty ubiquitous.
Taxes
Sales tax on merchandise is 5.75 percent
in D.C., 5 percent in Maryland, and 4.5 per-
cent in Virginia. Restaurant taxes are 10
percent in D.C., 5 percent in Maryland, and
4.5 percent in Virginia. Hotel taxes are 
14.5 percent in D.C., 5 percent (plus another
1-percent to 10-percent local tax) in
Maryland, and about 10 percent in Virginia.
Taxis
D.C. taxis don’t have meters. You’re
charged according to the zones you travel
through — $6.50 within one zone, $8.80 for
two, and so on. See Chapter 4 for a more
detailed explanation of this complicated
fare system. Washington cabs usually are
easy to hail on the street. When I need to
order a cab, I call Diamond (% 202-387-
6200, 202-797-5916, 202-797-5915, or, for
airport service, 202-387-2600).
Time Zone
Washington is in the Eastern time zone. For
the correct time, dial % 202-844-2525. For
the official U.S. time, go to the National
Institute of Standards and Technology’s
Internet clock at www.nist.time.gov.
Transit Info
For Metrorail (subway) and Metrobus
information, call % 202-637-7000 or visit
the Metrorail Web site www.wmata.com.
Weather
For the D.C. weather conditions and fore-
cast, call % 202-936-1212, listen to WTOP
1500 am “on the 8s” (8 after the hour, 18
after, and so on), watch the Weather
Channel, or surf over to www.weather.

Where to Get More Information
If I haven’t packed enough information into this book for you, you can
consult the following resources for additional details.
Tourist information offices
 Call or write the Washington, D.C., Visitor Information Center, on
the ground floor of the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center
Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, at the Federal Triangle Metro-
rail Station (% 866-324-7386; www.dcvisit.com), and ask for a
free copy of the Washington, D.C., Visitors Guide, which contains
information about visitor services, hotels, restaurants, sights,
transportation, and tours. The organization’s Web site contains 
lots of info and updates you on events.
 For everything you want to know about the many Smithsonian
Institution facilities, check out the Smithsonian Information
Center, in the “Castle,” 1000 Jefferson Dr. SW, on the National Mall,
near the Smithsonian Metrorail Station (% 202-633-1000; TTY
202-357-1729; www.si.edu/visit/infocenter/start.htm; e-mail:
info@si.edu). The center also has information about events else-
where in the city.
Newspapers and magazines
 You can find the Washington Post online at www.washington
post.com. The Web site provides up-to-the-minute news, weather,
visitor information, restaurant reviews, and online discussions of
various subjects. Near the top of the home page, click “City Guide”
for voluminous information about attractions, lodging, and night-
spots, as well as restaurant reviews.
 For another informed perspective on all those things visitors like 
to know about a city, visit the Web site of Washingtonian, D.C.’s
leading local magazine (www.washingtonian.com). At the top of
the home page you’ll see links to information about restaurants,
art, sports, and other topics that might interest you. Check out
Washingtonian’s lists of D.C.’s 100 best restaurants, “cheap eats,”
and “dirt-cheap eats.”
Other sources of information
 Go to the Web site www.nps.gov/parks.html to access informa-
tion about National Park Service facilities. You can find detailed
information about all National Park Service sites, as well as individ-
ual listings for sites in the Washington area by name (Washington
Monument, for example). Or click on “Geographic Search” for a list
of all facilities in the Washington area.
 If you’re looking for information about National and Dulles air-
ports, go to the Web site www.metwashairports.com. It contains
Washington, D.C. For Dummies, 4th Edition 
318

everything you want to know about flight schedules, flight status,
ground transportation, terminal maps, and airport facilities.
Baltimore/Washington International Airport’s Web site is at
www.bwiairport.com.
 At the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Web site
(www.wmata.com), you can find timetables, maps, fare schedules,
and more information useful to riders of Washington’s buses and
subway.
 I particularly like the online map of the area around each
Metrorail station that you can find at www.stationmasters.com.
Click on “go to the Metrorail system map,” then click the station
you’re interested in.
