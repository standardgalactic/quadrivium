Preface
VMware is the industry leader in datacenter virtualization. Its vSphere 5.x suite of products 
provides a robust and resilient platform for virtualizing server and application workloads. 
The features available in vSphere 5.x simplify the management of resources, increase the 
availability of applications, and guarantee the performance of workloads deployed in the 
virtualized datacenter.
This book provides recipes for creating a virtual datacenter design using the features of 
vSphere 5.x by guiding you through the process of identifying the design factors and applying 
them to the logical and physical design process.
The book provides steps that walk you through the design process from beginning to end, 
right from the discovery process to creating the conceptual design; calculating the resource 
requirements of the logical storage, compute, and network design; mapping the logical 
requirements to a physical design; and finally creating the design documentation.
The recipes in the book provide guidance for making design decisions to ensure  
the successful creation, and ultimately the successful implementation of a VMware  
vSphere 5.x virtual datacenter design.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, The Virtual Datacenter, provides an introduction to the benefits of the virtual 
datacenter, the VMware vSphere products, and basic virtualization concepts. The chapter 
identifies the differences between a datacenter administrator and a datacenter architect. 
An overview of the VMware Certified Advanced Professional Datacenter Design (VCAP-DCD) 
certification is also covered.
Chapter 2, The Discovery Process, explains how to identify stakeholders, conduct stakeholder 
interviews, and perform technical assessments to discover the business and technical goals of 
a virtualization project. The chapter covers how to use tools, the VMware Capacity planner and 
Windows Performance Monitor, to collect resource information during the discovery process.

design. Details on selecting a virtual switch topology, designing for network availability, and 
the network requirements to support vMotion and IP-connected storage are also covered.
Chapter 7, The vSphere Compute Design, provides recipes for calculating the CPU and 
memory requirements to create the logical compute design. The chapter also covers  
cluster design considerations for High Availability (HA) and the Distributed Resource  
Scheduler (DRS).
Chapter 8, The vSphere Physical Design, explains how to satisfy the design factors by mapping 
the logical management, storage, network, and compute designs to hardware, to create the 
physical vSphere design. The chapter also provides details on creating a custom installation, 
on ISO to install ESXi, and on the best practices for host BIOS configurations.
Chapter 9, The Virtual Machine Design, looks at the design of virtual machines and 
application workloads running in the virtual datacenter. Recipes are provided for right-sizing 
virtual machine resources, enabling the ability to add virtual machine resources, and creating 
virtual machine templates. The chapter details the use of affinity and anti-affinity rules to 
improve application efficiency and availability. Converting or migrating physical servers to 
virtual machines is also covered in this chapter.
Chapter 10, Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity, covers options for backup, recovery, 
and continued operations in the event of a system failure. The chapter covers how to create 
backups of vSphere configurations so they can be quickly restored. The protection of virtual 
machines using VMware products for backup and replication is also covered in this chapter.

Introduction
This chapter focuses on many of the basic concepts and benefits of virtualization. It provides 
a quick overview of VMware virtualization, introduces the virtual datacenter architect, and 
lays some of the groundwork necessary for creating and implementing a successful virtual 
datacenter design using VMware vSphere 5.x.
We will also take a look at the VMware Certified Advanced Professional-Data Center 
Design (VCAP-DCD) certification, including a few tips that should help you prepare for and 
successfully complete the certification exam.
If you are already familiar with virtualization, this chapter will provide a review of many of the 
benefits and technologies of virtualization.
Since the focus of this book is on design, we will not go into great detail discussing  
the specifics of how to configure resources in a virtual datacenter. Most of you probably 
already have a good understanding of VMware's virtualization architecture, so this section  
will provide just a basic overview of the key VMware components that are the building blocks 
to the virtual datacenter.

The Virtual Datacenter
8
Virtualization creates a layer of abstraction between the physical hardware and the virtual 
machines that run on it. Virtual hardware is presented to the virtual machine granting access to 
the underlying physical hardware, which is scheduled by the hypervisor's kernel. The hypervisor 
separates the physical hardware from the virtual machine as shown in the following diagram:

The hypervisor
At the core of any virtualization platform is the hypervisor. The VMware hypervisor is named 
vSphere ESXi, simply referred to as ESXi. ESXi is a Type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor. This means 
it runs directly on the host's hardware to present virtual hardware to the virtual machines. In 
turn, the hypervisor schedules access to the physical hardware of the hosts.
ESXi allows multiple virtual machines with a variety of operating systems to run 
simultaneously, sharing the resources of the underlying physical hardware. Access to 
physical resources, such as memory, CPU, storage, and network, used by the virtual 
machines is managed by the scheduler or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) provided by 
ESXi. The resources presented to the virtual machines can be overcommitted; this means 
more resources than are available can be allocated to the virtual machines on the physical 
hardware. Advanced memory sharing and reclamation techniques, such as Transparent Page 
Sharing (TPS) and ballooning, along with CPU scheduling allow for overcommitment of these 
resources to be possible, resulting in greater virtual to physical consolidation ratios.
ESXi is a 64-bit hypervisor that must be run on a 64-bit hardware. An ESXi installation requires 
less than 150 MB of space for installation. It can be installed on a hard disk locally, a USB 
device, a Logical Unit Number (LUN) on a Storage Area Network (SAN), or deployed stateless 
on hosts with no storage. The small footprint of an ESXi installation provides a reduction in the 
management overhead associated with patching and security hardening.
With the release of vSphere 5.0, VMware retired the ESX hypervisor. ESX had a separate 
Linux-based service console for the management interface of the hypervisor. Management 
functions were provided by agents running in the service console. The service console has 
since been removed from ESXi and agents now run directly on ESXi's VMkernel.

Chapter 1
9
To manage a standalone host running ESXi, a Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) is 
provided for basic configuration and troubleshooting. A shell is available that can either be 
accessed locally from the console or remotely using Secure Shell (SSH). The esxcli and 
other commands can be used in the shell to provide advanced configuration options. An ESXi 
host can also be accessed directly using the vSphere Client. The ESXi DCUI is shown in the 
following screenshot:
The DCUI can be accessed remotely using SSH by typing the 
command dcui in the prompt. Press Ctrl + C to exit the remote 
DCUI session.

Virtual machines
A virtual machine is a software computer that runs a guest operating system. Virtual 
machines are comprised of a set of configuration files and datafiles stored on local or remote 
storage. These configuration files contain information about the virtual hardware presented to 
the virtual machine. This virtual hardware includes the CPU, RAM, disk controllers, removable 
devices, and so on, and emulates the same functionality as the physical hardware. The 
following screenshot depicts the virtual machine files that are stored on a shared Network 
File System (NFS) datastore:
The files that make up a virtual machine are typically stored in a directory set aside for the 
particular virtual machine they represent. These files include the configuration file, virtual disk 
files, NVRAM file, and virtual machine logfiles.
The following table lists the common virtual machine file extensions along with a description 
of each:
File extension
Description
.vmx
This is a virtual machine configuration file. It contains the configurations of 
the virtual hardware that is presented to the virtual machine.
.vmdk
This is a virtual disk descriptor file. It contains a header and other 
information pertaining to the virtual disk.
-flat.vmdk
This is a preallocated virtual disk. It contains the content or data on the 
disk used by the virtual machine.

Chapter 1
11
File extension
Description
.nvram
This is a file that stores the state of a virtual machine's Basic Input Output 
System (BIOS) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configurations.
.vswp
This is a virtual machine swap file. It gets created when a virtual machine 
is powered on. The size of this file is equal to the amount of memory 
allocated minus any memory reservations.
.log
This is a virtual machine logfile.
.vmsd
This is a virtual machine file used with snapshots to store data about each 
snapshot active on a virtual machine.
.vmsn
This is a virtual machine snapshot data file.
Virtual machines can be deployed using a variety of methods as follows:
f
f
Using the New Virtual Machine Wizard in the vSphere Client
f
f
By getting converted from a physical machine using the VMware Converter
f
f
By getting imported from an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) or Open Virtualization 
Alliance (OVA)
f
f
By getting cloned from an existing virtual machine
f
f
By getting deployed from a virtual machine template
When a new virtual machine is created, a guest operating system can be installed on  
the virtual machine. VMware vSphere 5 supports more than 80 different guest operating 
systems. These include many versions of the Windows server and desktop operating systems, 
many distributions and versions of Linux and Unix operating systems, and Apple Mac OS 
operating systems.
Virtual appliances are preconfigured virtual machines that can be imported to the virtual 
environment. A virtual appliance can be comprised of a single virtual machine or a group 
of virtual machines with all the components required to support an application. The virtual 
machines in a virtual appliance are preloaded with guest operating systems and the 
applications they run are normally preconfigured and optimized to run in a virtual environment.
Since virtual machines are just a collection of files on a disk, they become portable.  
Virtual machines can be moved from one location to another by simply moving or copying 
the associated files. Using VMware vSphere features such as vMotion, Enhanced vMotion, or 
Storage vMotion, virtual machines can be migrated from host to host or datastore to datastore 
while a virtual machine is running. Virtual machines can also be exported to an OVF or OVA to 
be imported into another VMware vSphere environment.

Virtual infrastructure management
VMware vCenter Server provides a centralized management interface to manage and 
configure groups of ESXi hosts in the virtualized datacenter. The vCenter Server is required to 
configure and control many advanced features, such as the Distributed Resource Scheduler 
(DRS), Storage DRS, and VMware High Availability (HA). The vCenter Server is accessed 
using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client. Many vendors provide plugins that 
can be installed to allow third-party storage, network, and compute resources to be managed 
using the vSphere Client.
The vCenter Server can be installed on a 64-bit Windows server. It can be run on  
dedicated physical hardware or as a virtual machine. When the vCenter Server is deployed 
on the Windows server, it requires either a Microsoft SQL or an Oracle database to store 
configuration and performance information. IBM DB2 databases are supported with vSphere 
5.1, but this support was removed in vSphere 5.5.
SQL Express can also be used for small environments of less than five hosts and 50 virtual 
machines. The database can either be installed locally on the same server as the vCenter 
Server or on a remote database server.
Another option for deploying the vCenter Server is the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA).  
The VCSA is a preconfigured, Linux-based virtual machine preinstalled with the vCenter Server 
components. The appliance includes an embedded database suitable for small deployments 
or a remote Oracle database.
Several other management and automation tools are available to aid the day-to-day 
administration of a vSphere environment: the vSphere Command-Line Interface (vCLI); 
vSphere PowerCLI provides a Windows PowerShell interface; vCenter Orchestrator can be used 
to automate tasks; and the vSphere Management Assistant (vMA) is a Linux-based virtual 
appliance that is used to run management and automation scripts against hosts. These tools 
allow an administrator to use command-line utilities to manage hosts from remote workstations.
VMware provides a suite of other products that benefit the virtualized datacenter. These 
datacenter products, such as vCenter Operations Manager, Site Recovery Manager, and 
vCloud Director, can each be leveraged in the virtual datacenter to meet specific requirements 
related to management, disaster recovery, and cloud services. At the core of these products is 
vSphere suite, which includes ESXi and the vCenter Server.

Understanding the benefits of virtualization
The following table provides a matrix of some of the core VMware technologies and the 
benefits that can be realized by using them. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list 
of all VMware technologies and features, but it does provide an insight into many of the 
technologies commonly deployed in the enterprise virtual datacenter.

f Resource efficiency
ESXi is VMware's bare-metal 
hypervisor that hosts virtual 
machines, also known as guests, 
and schedules virtual hardware 
access to physical resources.
HA
f
f Increased availability
HA restarts virtual machines in 
the event of a host failure. It also 
monitors and restarts the virtual 
machines in the event of a guest 
operating system failure.
vMotion and the 
VMware DRS

f Resource efficiency
f
f Increased availability
vMotion allows virtual machines to 
be live-migrated between hosts in a 
virtual datacenter. DRS determines 
the initial placement of the virtual 
machine on the host resources 
within a cluster and makes 
recommendations, or automatically 
migrates the virtual machines to 
balance resources across all hosts 
in a cluster.
Resource pools
f
f Resource efficiency
These are used to guarantee, 
reserve, or limit the virtual 
machine's CPU, memory, and disk 
resources.
VMware Fault 
Tolerance (FT)
f
f Increased availability
FT provides 100 percent uptime for 
a virtual machine in the event of 
a host hardware failure. It creates 
a secondary virtual machine that 
mirrors all the operations of the 
primary. In the event of a hardware 
failure, the secondary virtual 
machine becomes the primary and 
a new secondary is created.

the environment.
There are many others, and each technology or feature may also have its own set of 
requirements that must be met in order to be implemented. The purpose here is to show 
how features or technologies can be mapped to benefits, that can then be mapped to 
requirements and ultimately mapped into a design. This is helpful in ensuring that the 
benefits and technologies that virtualization provides, satisfy the design requirements.
Identifying when not to virtualize
Not all applications or server workloads are good candidates for virtualization. It is important 
that these workloads are identified early on in the design process.

Chapter 1
15
There are a number of reasons a server or application may not be suitable for virtualization. 
Some of these include the following:
f
f
Vendor support
f
f
Licensing issues
f
f
Specialized hardware dependencies
f
f
High resource demand
f
f
Lack of knowledge or skill sets
A common reason to not virtualize an application or workload is the reluctance of a vendor to 
support their application in a virtual environment. As virtualization has become more common 
in the enterprise datacenter, this has become uncommon; but, there are still application 
vendors that will not support their products once virtualized.
Software and operating systems licensing in a virtual environment can also be a challenge, 
especially when it comes to physical server to virtual machine conversions. Many physical 
servers are purchased with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) licenses, and 
these licenses, in most cases, cannot be transferred to a virtual environment. Also, many 
licenses are tied to hardware-specific information, such as interface MAC addresses or 
drive signatures. Licensing issues can usually be overcome. Many times the primary risk 
becomes the cost to upgrade or acquire new licensing. As with other potential design risks, 
it is important that any issues and potential impacts licensing may have on the design be 
identified early on in the design process.
Some applications may require the use of specialized hardware. Fax boards, serial ports, 
and security dongles are common examples. There are ways to provide solutions for many of 
these, but often with the risks associated with the ability to support the application or with the 
loss of one or more of the potential benefits of virtualizing the application, the better solution 
may be to leave the application on dedicated physical hardware. Again, it is important that 
these types of applications be identified very early on in the design process.
Physical servers configured with a large amount of CPU and memory resources where 
applications are consuming a large amount of these resources may not be good candidates 
for virtualization. This also holds true for applications with high network utilization and large 
storage I/O requirements. vSphere 5.1 supports virtual machines configured with up to  
64 Virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and 1 TB of RAM, but the high utilization of these configured 
resources can have a negative impact on other workloads in the virtual environment. These 
high-utilization workloads will also require more resources to be reserved for failover. The 
benefits of virtualizing resource-intensive applications must be weighed against the impact 
placed on the environment. In many cases, it may be better to leave these applications on 
dedicated physical hardware.

The Virtual Datacenter
16
Many administrators may lack knowledge of the benefits or skills to manage a virtualized 
datacenter. The administrator of a virtual environment must be well-versed with storage, 
networking, and virtualization in order to successfully configure, maintain, and monitor a 
virtual environment. Though this may not necessarily be a reason not to leverage the benefits 
of a virtualized environment, it can be a substantial risk to the acceptance of a design and 
the implementation. This is especially true with smaller IT departments where the roles of the 
server, application, storage, and network administrators are combined.
Each of these can introduce risks in the design. We will discuss how risk impacts the  
design process in much more detail in Chapter 2, The  Discovery Process, and Chapter 3,  
The Design Factors.
Becoming a virtual datacenter architect
The virtual datacenter architect or architect is someone who identifies requirements, designs 
a virtualization solution to meet those requirements, and then oversees the implementation 
of the solution. Sounds easy enough, right?
How to do itâ¦
The primary role of the architect is to provide solutions that meet customer requirements.  
At times, this can be difficult since the architect may not always be part of the complete  
sales process. Many times customers may purchase hardware from other vendors and look 
to us to help them "make it all work". In situations such as this, the purchased hardware 
becomes a constraint on the design. Identifying and dealing with constraints and other  
design factors will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, The  Discovery Process, and  
Chapter 3, The Design Factors.
The architect must also be able to identify requirements, both business and technical, 
by conducting stakeholder interviews and analyzing current configurations. Once the 
requirements have been identified, the architect must then map the requirements into 
a solution by creating a design. This design is then presented to the stakeholders, and if 
approved, it is implemented. During the implementation phase, the architect ensures that 
configurations are done to meet the design requirements and the work done stays within the 
scope of the design.
The architect must also understand best practice. Not just best practice for configuring the 
hypervisor, but for management, storage, security, and networking. Understanding best 
practice is the key. The architect not only knows best practice but understands why it is 
considered best practice. It is also important to understand when to deviate from what is 
considered best practice.

Chapter 1
17
There's moreâ¦
The large part of an architect's work is "customer facing". This includes conducting interviews 
with stakeholders to identify requirements and ultimately presenting the design to decision 
makers. Besides creating a solid solution to match the customer's requirements, it is 
important that the architect gains and maintains the trust of the project stakeholders.  
A professional appearance and, more importantly, a professional attitude are both  
helpful in building this relationship.
Using a holistic approach to datacenter 
design
The virtual datacenter architect must be able to take a holistic approach to datacenter design. 
This means that for every decision made, the architect must understand how the environment 
as a whole will be impacted.
An architect is required to be, at the very least, familiar with all aspects of the datacenter. 
They must understand how the different components of a datacenter, such as storage, 
networking, computing, security, and management, are interconnected, as shown in the 
following diagram:
Storage
Computing
Virtual
datacenter
design
Security
Network
Management
It has become very important to understand how any decision or change will impact the rest 
of the design. Identifying dependencies becomes an important part of the design process. If 
a change is made to the network, how are computing, management, and storage resources 
affected? What other dependencies will this introduce in the design? Failing to take a holistic 
approach to design can result in unnecessary complications during the design process and 
potentially costly fixes after the design is implemented.

How to do it...
You have been engaged to design a virtualization solution for a financial organization. The 
solution you are proposing is using 10 GB Converged Network Adapters (CNA) to provide 
connectivity to the organization's network in three 1U rackmount servers. The organization 
needs to separate a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) that is currently configured to be 
delivered over the CNA onto a physically separate network to satisfy a new compliance 
requirement. A 1 GB network will provide sufficient bandwidth for this network, and the 
network should be highly available. Single points of failure should be minimized.
To support this compliance requirement, you, the architect, must take a holistic approach to 
the design by answering a number of questions about each design decision, as follows:
f
f
Are there available network ports in the current rackmount servers or will a network 
card need to be added? If a card must be added, are there available Peripheral 
Component Interconnect (PCI) slots?
f
f
Will a dual port network card provide sufficient redundancy, or will the network need 
to be separated across physical cards? Are there onboard network ports available 
that can be used with a PCI network card to provide in-box redundancy?
f
f
Has the physical separate switch's hardware been obtained? If not, how long 
before the equipment is received and deployed? Will this have an impact on the 
implementation schedule?
f
f
How will the virtual switch need to be configured to provide the connectivity and 
redundancy that is required?
How it works...
The impact can be fairly significant, depending on some of the answers. For example,  
let's say the 1U rackmount server will not support the required network adapters needed  
to satisfy the requirement and a different 2U rackmount server must be used. This then  
raises more questions, such as is there sufficient space in the rackmount to support the  
new server footprint.
What if the requirement had been that the applications connected to this network be 
virtualized on separate physical server hardware and storage? What parts of the design  
would have to change? The architect must be able to understand the dependencies of each 
part of the design and how a change in one place may affect other areas of the design.
As you think through these questions, you should be able to see how a change to a 
requirement can have a deep impact on many other areas of the design. It becomes  
very important to identify requirements early on in the design process.

Passing the VMware VCAP-DCD exam
For vSphere 4 and vSphere 5, VMware released advanced exams testing the ability of a 
person to administer and design complex virtual environments. The exams for vSphere 5 are 
the VMware Certified Advanced Professional 5-Data Center Administration (VCAP5-DCA) 
exam, which focuses on administering a VMware vSphere environment, and the VMware 
Certified Advanced Professional 5-Data Center Design (VCAP5-DCD) exam, which focuses 
on designing a VMware vSphere environment.
The VCAP5-DCD exam tests your ability to design enterprise virtualized environments.  
To be successful, you must have an in-depth understanding of VMware's core components 
and the relationship they share with other components of the datacenter, such as storage, 
networking, and application services, along with a mastery of VMware's datacenter design 
methodologies and principles. All the exam objectives, including study resources, can be 
found in the exam blueprint. The exam blueprint can be found on the VCAP5-DCD page at 
http://www.vmware.com/go/vcapdcd.
Getting ready
Before you are eligible to take the VCAP5-DCD exam, you should have obtained the VMware 
Certified Professional 5âData Center Virtualization (VCP5-DCV) certification. Besides the 
training required for the VCP5-DCV certification, there is no other required training that must 
be completed in order to sit the VCAP5-DCD exam. When you are ready to schedule your 
VCAP5-DCD exam, you must submit an exam authorization request to VMware. When you 
submit the exam authorization request, VMware will verify that you have met the certification 
prerequisites and provide you with the access necessary to schedule the exam. It typically 
takes less than two business days to receive the exam authorization.
The exam consists of 100 questions and is scored using a scaled scoring system. You  
have 4 hours to complete the exam, and the exam has a scoring scale of 100-500 with a 
minimum passing score of 300. The questions are comprised of a mixture of multiple-choice, 
drag-and-drop, and design scenarios. Once you have submitted an answer for a question, you 
are not allowed to return to that question. It is important to note that there is also no way to 
flag an item for later review.
How to do itâ¦
The VCAP-DCD exam is one of the most challenging exams I have ever taken. Here are a few 
tips to help you prepare for and successfully sit the VCAP-DCD exam:

Practice time management: It is very important that you are aware of the amount of 
time you are taking on a question, and how much time remains. If you get hung up on 
a multiple-choice question, take your best guess and move on. Conserve time for the 
more complex, drag-and-drop and design scenario questions.
f

Introduction
This chapter will introduce you to the design factors and focus on the discovery phase of the 
design process.
The following image displays the phases of the design process:
Implementation
Logical design
Conceptual design
Discovery
Physical design
Approval

The Discovery Process
22
Discovery is the most important phase of the design process. It is also the most  
time-consuming. The discovery process includes a meeting with the stakeholders to  
determine business requirements that the design must meet. It also includes current  
state assessments to determine the technical requirements that the design must satisfy  
in order to meet the customer requirements, which in turn become the design requirements.
During the discovery process, an architect must interact with many different individuals in 
an organization to collect the necessary information that is needed to begin creating the 
conceptual design. Decision makers, strategic planners, facilities and maintenance providers, 
network administrators, storage administrators, application administrators, and application 
end users can, in some way, be impacted by or gain some benefit from a virtual datacenter 
design (some directly and others indirectly). Anyone that may be affected by the design should 
be identified to be included in the discovery process as early as possible.
The current state assessment is the process of collecting information about the physical 
resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, currently supporting the environment. 
Irrespective of whether the environment is physical servers, virtual servers, or a mix of virtual 
and physical servers, the current state assessment will identify the total resources available 
and the total resources actually in use.
There are a number of different tools available to perform a current state assessment of an 
environment. The tool used often depends on the size of the environment. VMware offers a 
Capacity Planner tool that provides a good way to automate this assessment. For a smaller 
environment of Windows servers, the Windows Performance Monitor (PerfMon) utility 
can be used to collect the current state information. For Linux systems, tools such as top, 
Kinfocenter, and Zabbix can be used to collect and analyze performance data.
Once the design factors have been identified and accepted, the design process continues with 
the logical and physical designs. The logical design maps the requirements to the resources 
required to satisfy the requirements. The physical design then maps the logical design onto 
the physical hardware that will provide these resources.
Identifying the design factors
The design factors are the primary considerations that influence the design. These factors 
define the function that the design must accomplish, how it should accomplish it, and what 
may prevent the design from accomplishing it.
How to do itâ¦
The design factors encompass much more than just the physical resources, such as the CPU, 
memory, and storage, necessary to run workloads in a virtual environment.

Chapter 2
23
Identifying the design factors needs the following requirements:
f
f
Functional and nonfunctional requirements
f
f
Constraints
f
f
Assumptions
f
f
Risks
How it worksâ¦
Requirements define what a design must do and how it should do it. Requirements can be 
business or technical. There are two types of requirements: functional and nonfunctional.  
The requirements should be clearly defined. A good design requirement is verifiable, 
traceable, feasible, and specific.
Functional requirements specify a specific function of the design or simply what a design 
must do. Functional requirements can be business or technical requirements. The design 
must provide a capacity for 10 percent growth over the next three years; this is an example  
of a functional requirement.
Nonfunctional requirements specify how the design must perform or operate. While a 
functional requirement defines something that the design must do, the nonfunctional 
requirement defines how or how well it must be done. System response time is an example of 
a nonfunctional requirement. Nonfunctional requirements become constraints on the design.
Assumptions are considered valid until they have been proven otherwise. These factors 
are considered to be true, but further discovery is required to validate them. As part of the 
design process, assumptions should be documented and then proven or disproven. Sufficient 
bandwidth being available between different sites to support site-to-site replication is an 
example of an assumption, if the bandwidth available between the sites or the bandwidth 
required for replication has not yet been identified.
Constraints place limits on the design choices. Constraints can be business policies or 
technical limitations. Using a specific vendor for a server's hardware is an example of a 
technical constraint. The project's budget and the deadlines are also common constraints. 
Nonfunctional requirements, since they specify how the design must perform or behave, will 
also become constraints on the design.
Risks may prevent the design from being successful. Risks should be clearly identified to 
minimize surprises that may prevent the successful implementation of the design. A good 
design will address and mitigate the risks.
Since the focus of this chapter is on design discovery, I felt it was important to provide this brief 
introduction to the design factors. We will dive much deeper into determining and defining the 
requirements, constraints, assumptions, and risks in Chapter 3, The Design Factors.

The Discovery Process
24
Identifying stakeholders
A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in or benefits from the design. A virtual datacenter 
design will have at least some impact on many, if not all, areas of an organization and not just 
those associated with technology.
How to do itâ¦
Identify the key stakeholders, including the following:
f
f
Project sponsors
f
f
Application owners and providers
f
f
System, network, and storage administrators
f
f
Application users
How it worksâ¦
Understanding the role of the stakeholders helps an architect to identify who can provide the 
information necessary to design a successful virtual datacenter solution. The details of the 
stakeholders and their roles are specified in the following table:
Stakeholders
Roles
C-level executives
f
f Strategic planning for the organization
f
f Setting up business policies and goals
f
f Budget approval

f Project sponsorship
Business unit managers or 
directors

f Managing day-to-day operations
f
f Influencing business policies and goals
f
f Make and/or influence decisions
Application owners
f
f Consumers of IT infrastructure
f
f Document the application and dependencies
f
f Manage the application functions
f
f Provide day-to-day support for the application

Project sponsors are typically C-level executives, vice presidents (VPs), or directors. The 
project sponsor may also be a committee formed by an organization to evaluate the solutions 
to business problems or to explore new business opportunities. These stakeholders are often 
the best resource for obtaining the business requirements that a design must satisfy. If there 
is a project or a need to explore opportunities, there is a business goal or need driving it. 
Project sponsors may make the final decision on whether a design has to be approved and 
accepted for implementation, or they may provide the recommendations for acceptance.
There's moreâ¦
Stakeholders or the project team will ultimately be the ones that sign off on or approve the 
design factors that will be the basis for the logical and physical design. These design factors 
are identified by analyzing the data collected from the stakeholder interviews and the current 
state assessments.
The stakeholder's consensus and acceptance of the design factors must be obtained before 
proceeding with the design process. If you skip this step, you will end up wasting your time 
and the time of the stakeholders, having to rework areas of the design when requirements are 
missed, changed, added, or removed.
Define the design factors and obtain acceptance from the project team or stakeholders before 
taking the next steps in the design process.

The Discovery Process
26
Conducting stakeholder interviews
During the discovery process, the primary source of information will be the stakeholder 
interviews. These interviews can be face-to-face meetings or can be done over the phone  
(or the Web). Interviews are not only helpful in collecting information about the business 
needs and technical requirements, but also keep the stakeholders engaged in the project.
How to do itâ¦
Following are examples of the questions that should be asked in order to determine the 
business requirements that will influence the design:
f
f
What are the business initiatives, challenges, and goals?
f
f
Are there Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) in place? What are they?
f
f
What are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
requirements?
f
f
Are there any compliance requirements?
f
f
Who are the SMEs associated with the project?
f
f
Who are the stakeholders?
f
f
Who are the decision makers?
f
f
Are there deadlines that the project must meet?
f
f
Is there a budget for the project? What is the budget for the project?
Following are examples of the questions that should be asked in order to determine the 
technical requirements that will influence the design:
f
f
Are there any current issues or technical pain points within the environment?
f
f
What are the technology initiatives, challenges, and goals?
f
f
How many servers will be virtualized as part of this project?
f
f
Is there a preferred vendor for the server, network, or storage?
f
f
Have any servers already been virtualized? What hypervisor is being used to host the 
already-virtualized servers?
f
f
What type of growth is expected over the next 3-5 years?
f
f
What Operation-Level Agreements (OLAs) are in place?
f
f
Is there a current network, system, storage, application documentation?

Chapter 2
27
How it worksâ¦
Meetings and interviews with stakeholders should maintain some type of structure or 
formality. Even if it is just a quick call, you should have some type of agenda. I know this may 
sound like overkill, but it will help you keep the call or meeting on track and, more importantly, 
help to ensure that you collect the information you need from the call or meeting.
There are some key items that will help determine the design factors, which are explained  
as follows:
f
f
Service-Level Agreements (SLAs): These are a part of a service contract where 
a service, its availability (uptime and access), and its performance (application 
response and transaction processing) are defined
f
f
Service-Level Objective (SLO): This defines specific objectives that must be achieved 
as part of the SLA
f
f
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): This is the amount of time in which a service must 
be restored after a disruption or disaster
f
f
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): This is the maximum amount of data loss 
acceptable due to a disruption or disaster
f
f
Operation-Level Agreements (OLAs): This is an internal agreement that defines 
relationships between support groups
Do not expect to complete the discovery in a single meeting or interview, especially for a large 
enterprise project. There will be follow-up questions that may need to be asked, and there will 
likely be questions that require more research to be answered.
In situations where more research is required, make sure that someone has been assigned 
with the responsibility to complete the research. Set an expectation on when the research 
should be completed and the information should be available. You want to avoid the "I thought 
so-and-so was getting that" situations and also keep the discovery process moving forward.
VMware Capacity Planner
VMware's Capacity Planner is an inventory and planning tool available to VMware partner 
organizations, which collects resource utilization information from systems, analyzes the 
data against industry-standard reference data, and provides the information needed to 
successfully consolidate the servers into a virtualized environment.

The Discovery Process
28
How to do itâ¦
Follow these steps to complete a Capacity Planner engagement:
1.	 Determine the amount of time for which the Capacity Planner engagement should 
run based on the business cycle.
2.	 Choose the type of Capacity Planner assessment to be run: a Consolidation 
Estimate (CE) or a Capacity Assessment (CA).
3.	 Deploy the Capacity Planner collector in the environment to be assessed.
4.	 Verify whether the collector is collecting performance metrics for the systems  
to be analyzed.
5.	 Collect metrics for the duration of the business cycle.
6.	 Generate Capacity Planner reports.
How it worksâ¦
A Capacity Planner engagement should typically run for at least 30 days to ensure that it 
covers a complete monthly business cycle. Thirty days is considered typical since this covers 
a monthly business cycle where the demand for resources increases during the end-of-month 
or beginning-of-month processing. It is important that the Capacity Planner capture these 
increases. The time frame for a Capacity Planner engagement can vary depending on the size 
and nature of the business.
There are two types of Capacity Planner assessments: the CE and the CA. The CE assessment 
provides the sizing estimates of the current environment, while the CA assessment provides 
a more detailed analysis of the current environment. The CE assessment helps demonstrate 
what can be achieved by virtualizing physical workloads, and the CA assessment provides 
guidance on how systems may be virtualized.
A Capacity Planner collector is installed in the environment that is being assessed. The 
collector runs as a Windows service and is configured using the VMware Capacity Planner 
Data Manager. The collector must be installed on a Windows machine, but inventory and 
performance data can be collected from both Windows and Linux/Unix servers. More than 
one collector may need to be installed for larger environments. A single collector can collect 
data from a maximum of 500 systems. The following screenshot depicts the VMware Capacity 
Planner Data Manager:

Chapter 2
29
The collector or collectors discover systems in the environment and collect inventory and 
performance data from the systems. The inventory includes information about the installed 
physical hardware, operating systems, and installed software.
If running the VMware Capacity Planner Data Manager 
on a Windows 7 workstation, use Run as Administrator.

Performance data metrics are collected on CPU utilization, RAM utilization, disk capacity, 
and disk I/O. This data is then sent securely to the VMware Capacity Planner Dashboard at 
https://optimize.vmware.com/ to be analyzed. The following screenshot shows the 
VMware Capacity Planner Data Manager processor utilization report:
There can be some challenges to setting up the VMware Capacity Planner. Issues with setting 
up the correct credentials required for data collection and configuring Windows Firewall and 
services to allow the data collection are common issues that may be encountered.
The following table includes the services and ports that must be open on target systems to 
allow the Capacity Planner collector to collect data:
Service

Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
TCP/135
NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)
TCP/137
NetBIOS Datagram Service (NBDS)
TCP/138
NetBIOS Session Service (NBSS)
TCP/139
Microsoft-DS
TCP/445
Secure Shell (SSH) (Unix/Linux only)
TCP/22
In order to collect data from Windows systems, Windows Management Instrumentation 
(WMI), Remote Registry, and PerfMon must be enabled on the target system. For data 
collection on Linux or Unix systems, port 22 must be open and the Secure Shell Daemon 
(SSHD) must be running. Account credentials provided must have at least local administrator 
rights on the target systems.

Once the inventory and performance data has been collected, the results can be analyzed 
and reports can be generated. Some of this information can be viewed and exported from the 
VMware Capacity Planner Data Manager, but detailed analysis reports are generated from the 
VMware Capacity Planner Dashboard at the following link:
https://optimize.vmware.com/
If server hardware constraints have been identified during the discovery process, report 
settings can be adjusted. These constraints will then be applied to the Capacity Planner 
reporting to determine and show the consolidation ratios that can be obtained using the 
different hardware configurations. The following screenshot shows the report settings:

The reports that are available include the Progress Report, which provides an overview  
of the status of the assessment; the Executive Summary Presentation, which provides a  
high-level summary of the assessment; and the Assessment Report, which provides 
information on consolidation ratios and recommendations. Custom reports can also  
be generated. The following screenshot shows the consolidation recommendations:
Using Windows Performance Monitor
The Microsoft Windows PerfMon can be used to collect performance information, such as CPU 
utilization, memory utilization, and disk I/O utilization of the Windows servers.
How to do itâ¦
In this example, Microsoft Windows PerfMon is used to collect disk I/O metrics using the 
following steps:
1.	 Open Performance Monitor and use the Data Collector Set wizard to create a  
user-defined data collector as displayed in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2

How it worksâ¦
The total number of IOPS and the I/O profile of a server are necessary to architect the 
storage required for a virtualized environment correctly. The IOPS and I/O profile are helpful 
in determining which Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) level to use with the 
number of and the type of disk to be used in order to support the server storage workload.
Windows PerfMon can also be configured to collect metrics associated with CPU and memory 
usage by simply adding the associated counters to the Data Collector Set.
There's moreâ¦
Most organizations will have some form of network-or resource-monitoring system in place, 
such as Nagios, SolarWinds, or Splunk. The information monitored and collected by these 
systems will be useful for the current state assessments. The SMEs should be asked if there 
is monitoring in place and for access to the data collected by these systems.
Many vendors also perform free infrastructure assessments. Often, these free assessments 
are not thorough enough to provide the details necessary for a complete current state 
assessment, but they can provide some good information. Again, the project SMEs will be 
asked if any type of assessments have been done.
Identifying dependencies
A dependency is a relationship among systems or services. During the discovery process, 
dependencies should be identified and documented. In Chapter 1, The Virtual Datacenter, we 
discussed the importance of taking a holistic view when designing a virtualized environment. 
Identifying dependencies is the key to the holistic approach of designing.
How to do itâ¦
An architect must identify dependencies in order to understand what effect a design decision or 
change may have on other services. The architect should identify the following dependencies:
f
f
Identify physical infrastructure dependencies
f
f
Identify application and service dependencies
How it worksâ¦
Dependencies can be service-to-service; for example, a web application depends on a 
frontend web server and a backend database. Dependencies can be service-to-infrastructure; 
for example, the web application requires a static IP address and a minimum of 10 MB of 
network bandwidth.

Chapter 2
39
Physical and infrastructure dependencies are generally easier to discover and are commonly 
documented. Applications will have dependencies, which include server resources, network 
resources, and storage resources. Infrastructure dependencies that are not documented are 
often readily discovered as part of the current state assessment. The following table is an 
example of how physical application dependencies can be documented.

Service-to-service or application-to-service dependencies can be a bit more difficult to 
discover. Application owners, application developers, application documentation, and 
application vendors will be the best sources for determining these dependencies.
The following diagram is an example of how service dependencies can be mapped  
and documented:
DHCP
AD
DNS
E-mail
OWA
File server
CMS
Database
Application server
Web server

The Discovery Process
40
Understanding the dependencies will help an architect to understand how a change made 
to one area of the design may have an effect on another area of the design. Mapping 
and documenting application dependencies will provide the necessary information to 
properly design a solution for business continuity and disaster recovery. Understanding the 
dependencies will also aid in troubleshooting issues with the design implementation.
Beware that there may be undocumented dependencies that are not easily discovered. This 
can often be a risk to the design, especially in an organization with a legacy of unsupported 
applications or applications developed in-house that have not been properly documented.
I have seen issues where a specific configuration such as an IP address or a file location 
has been hardcoded into an application and not documented. A change is made to the 
environment and hence the application becomes unavailable. Dependencies of this  
type can be extremely difficult to plan for and discover.

Introduction
During the discovery process, information is collected on the business and technical goals  
of the virtualization project. This information must be analyzed in order to determine the 
design factors.
The design factors that must be determined are as follows:

The Design Factors
42
Determining the requirements, making and proving assumptions, determining constraints, 
and identifying risks form the conceptual design. Business and technical design factors 
identified as part of the conceptual design will be mapped to the resources that are  
necessary to satisfy them during the logical design process.
In our example design, after conducting interviews with stakeholders and performing 
technical assessments of the environment, the following information has been collected about 
the project's goals, current environment, and business factors that will influence the design:
f
f
Currently, there are 100 physical servers, each hosting a single application.  
Each application services 10 customers.
f
f
The business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year.
f
f
Support growth over the next five years.
f
f
Application uptime and accessibility is very important.
f
f
Consolidate physical servers to reduce hardware costs associated with the 
maintenance and deployment of new application servers.
f
f
Not more than 20 application servers or 200 customers should be affected by a 
hardware failure.
f
f
There should be a one-hour maintenance window each month for application  
and hardware maintenance. Hardware maintenance is currently a challenge. Since 
hardware and application maintenance cannot be performed at the same time, the 
maintenance window does not typically provide the time required to perform both 
application and hardware maintenance.
f
f
Application servers run Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 as the operating system.
f
f
Each application server is configured with 8 GB of memory. The peak usage of a 
single application server is approximately 65 percent or approximately 5.2 GB.
f
f
Each application server is configured with two dual-core 2.7 GHz processors. The 
peak usage of a single application server is approximately 10 percent of the total  
or approximately 1 GHz.
f
f
Each application server is configured with 100 GB of disk space. Peak disk capacity 
usage of a single application server is approximately 65 percent of the total or 65 GB. 
Peak disk performance of a single application server is 50 IOPS with an I/O profile of 
90 percent read and 10 percent write.

Currently, the stakeholders are using HP DL360 servers. The infrastructure team is 
very familiar with the management and maintenance of these servers and wants to 
continue using them.

Currently, each physical server contains a single gigabit network interface card. Peak 
network usage is 10 Mbps.

If an application server fails, the current recovery time is around 8 hours. The solution 
should reduce this time to less than 4 hours.

The management team expects the implementation to be completed before the  
third quarter.

There is an approved project budget of $200,000.
In this chapter, we will use this information to determine the design factors in order to create 
the conceptual design. Throughout the design process, each design decision is mapped back 
to these design factors.
Identifying design requirements
The design requirements specify the functions that the design must perform and the 
objectives that the design must meet.
There are two types of requirements, functional requirements and nonfunctional 
requirements. Functional requirements specify the objectives or functions that a  
design must meet. Nonfunctional requirements define how the design accomplishes  
the functional requirements.
Typical functional requirements include the following:
f
f
Business goals
f
f
Business rules
f
f
Legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements
f
f
Application system requirements
f
f
Technical requirements
f
f
Administrative functions

The Design Factors
44
Typical nonfunctional requirements include the following:
f
f
Performance
f
f
Security
f
f
Capacity
f
f
Availability
f
f
Manageability
f
f
Recoverability
When identifying and defining the requirements, separate the functional requirements from 
the nonfunctional requirements; nonfunctional requirements are design constraints and will 
be documented separately.
Since functional requirements define what the design must accomplish, once identified and 
approved, these requirements typically cannot be easily changed during the design process.
How to do it...
1.	 Analyze the business and technical information collected during the discovery process.
2.	 Determine the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the design.
3.	 Document the design requirements.
How it works...
When defining the requirements, each requirement should be clearly stated and specified. 
Define requirements individually; multiple requirements should not be combined into a  
single requirement.
During the discovery process, the following information about the current size of the existing 
environment was identified:
f
f
Currently, there are 100 physical servers, each hosting a single application.  
Each application services 10 customers.
f
f
Not more than 20 application servers or 200 customers should be affected by a 
hardware failure.
f
f
Consolidate physical servers to reduce the hardware costs associated with 
maintaining and refreshing the hardware of the existing application servers.
One of the goals of the project is to consolidate the physical servers in order to reduce 
hardware costs. An example design requirement to support this might be as follows:
f
f
Consolidate existing physical servers

Chapter 3
45
This requirement is vague and with the information available from the discovery, the 
requirement should be more specific. Based on the number of existing physical servers and 
the maximum number of customers that should be impacted during a hardware failure, a 
better requirement example may be as follows:
f
f
Consolidate the existing 100 physical application servers down to five servers
Information about the expected growth of the environment was also discovered:
f
f
The business expects to add 50 new customers each year
f
f
Support growth over the next five years
Based on this information, there is a requirement that the environment must be designed to 
provide the capacity necessary to support future growth. An example requirement to support 
this might be:
f
f
Provide sufficient capacity to support growth
Again this requirement is very vague and does not provide any information about how much 
the growth will be or over what period of time is growth expected. From the discovery, it is 
known that the business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year. Each server 
hosts a single application, which will provide service for 10 customers. The solution should 
support growth over the next five years.
Using this information, a requirement that specifies the growth that should be supported and 
the time period over which this growth is expected is as follows:
f
f
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers over the next 
five years
The architect can also determine the availability of requirements for hardware maintenance 
and application resiliency:
f
f
A one-hour maintenance window each month for application and hardware 
maintenance. Hardware maintenance is currently a challenge. Since hardware and 
application maintenance cannot be performed at the same time, the maintenance 
window does not typically provide the time required to perform both application and 
hardware maintenance.
f
f
Application uptime and accessibility is very important.
f
f
Not more than 20 application servers or 200 customers should be affected by a 
hardware failure.
From this information, the requirement that might be identified is that the server hardware 
maintenance should not affect application uptime, and redundancy should be maintained 
during hardware maintenance operations.

The Design Factors
46
The problem with this requirement is that it includes two separate requirements;  
one requirement is for application uptime, and another requirement is for redundancy.  
These requirements should be split into two individual requirements.
Server hardware maintenance should not affect application uptime.
Provide N+2 redundancy to support a hardware failure during normal 
and maintenance operations.
There's more...
Once the functional requirements have been identified and defined, the requirements 
should be recorded in the design documentation as part of the conceptual design. There 
are a number of formats that can be used, such as bulleted lists and numbered lists, but a 
simple table works well. Assigning an ID to each requirement makes it easier to reference the 
requirement later in the design document.
ID
Requirement
R001
Consolidate the existing 100 physical application servers down to five servers
R002
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers over 
the next five years
R003
Server hardware maintenance should not affect application uptime
R004
Provide N+2 redundancy to support a hardware failure during normal and 
maintenance operations
Identifying design constraints
The design constraints are factors that restrict the options the architect can use to satisfy 
the design requirements. Once the functional and nonfunctional requirements have been 
identified, they are separated. The nonfunctional requirements that define how requirements 
must be satisfied become the constraints on the design.
Design constraints include the following:
f
f
Technology constraints such as hardware vendors, software solutions, and protocols
f
f
Operational constraints such as performance and accessibility
f
f
Financial constraints such as budgets

Chapter 3
47
Unlike functional requirements, the constraints and nonfunctional requirements may change 
during the design process. This holds true especially if the constraint introduces risks into 
the design. For example, if an identified constraint that requires a specific model of hardware 
to be used prevents the design from satisfying a functional requirement, the constraint may 
need to be changed or adjusted.
How to do it...
1.	 Analyze the business and technical information collected during the discovery process.
2.	 Determine the nonfunctional requirements of the design.
Â
Â
Nonfunctional requirements are constraints on the design
3.	 Identify any other constraints on the design.
4.	 Document the design constraints.
How it works...
As with functional requirements, when defining the nonfunctional requirements or constraints, 
they should be clearly stated and specified. Define each constraint individually; do not 
combine multiple nonfunctional requirements into a single constraint.
f
f
Currently, HP DL360 servers are used. The infrastructure team is very familiar with the 
management and maintenance of these servers and wants to continue using them.
This statement does not identify something the design must do. It is placing a constraint 
on the design by providing a specific type of hardware that should be used. Following is an 
example of the constraint that can be formed from this statement:
f
f
HP DL360 servers should be used for compute resources
Budgetary constraints affect nearly all the projects. There will likely be a limit on the amount 
of money a company will want to spend to accomplish a goal.
If a budget has not been established for a project, it is likely that 
the business has not committed to the project. Beware of the 
infinite budget.
During the design discovery, the following budget was identified for this project:
f
f
There is an approved project budget of $200,000
This budget constraint can simply be stated as: A project budget of $200,000.

The Design Factors
48
Operational constraints are also common. Often, there will be existing processes or policies in 
place that will need to be factored into the design. Often, you will need to accommodate the 
existing monitoring and management applications in the design. An example of an operational 
requirement is as follows:
f
f
Server logs are auditable and must be retained for six months. All logs should also be 
sent to a central Syslog server that is already in place.
Here, a functional and nonfunctional requirement can be identified. The functional 
requirement is that the server logs are auditable and must be retained for six months. This 
functional requirement defines something the design must do, but there is also a constraint 
on how the design must accomplish this, and that is by using Syslog to send logs to a central 
server. Based on this information, the constraint is as follows:
f
f
Syslog should be used to send server logs to an existing central Syslog server
There's more...
Constraints should be documented as part of the conceptual design. Just as you used a table 
to document the design requirements, using a simple table works well when documenting the 
design constraints. Each constraint is assigned an ID, so it can be easily referenced later in 
the design document.
ID
Constraint
C001
HP DL360 servers should be used for compute resources
C002
A project budget of $200,000
C003
Syslog should be used to send server logs to an existing central Syslog server 
Making design assumptions
Assumptions are made by the architect and have not yet been validated. Assumptions are 
accepted as a fact until they have been validated or not. As part of the design process, each 
assumption needs to be validated as a fact. If an assumption cannot be validated, a risk will 
be introduced into the design.
How to do it...
Any assumptions that are made will need to be defined and documented as follows:
1.	 Identify any assumptions that have been made about the design.
2.	 Document the design assumptions.

Chapter 3
49
How it works...
Common assumptions relate to power, space, and cooling. A common example of an 
assumption that an architect may make is as follows:
f
f
There is sufficient power, cooling, and floor/rack space available in the datacenter to 
support both the existing and consolidated environment during the migration
When working through the physical design, the power, cooling, and space requirements will 
need to be identified and the assumption validated. A goal of this project is to consolidate 
the existing physical servers. The overall need for power, cooling, and space will be reduced 
once the project is complete, But enough of these resources need to be available to support 
both the existing physical environment and the new consolidated environment during the 
consolidation process.
A requirement was identified based on the discovery information to provide N+2 redundancy.
R004
Provide N+2 redundancy to support a hardware failure during normal and 
maintenance operations
This requirement was defined based on the following discovery information:
f
f
A one-hour maintenance window each month for application and hardware 
maintenance. Hardware maintenance is currently a challenge. Since hardware and 
application maintenance cannot be performed at the same time, the maintenance 
window does not typically provide the time necessary to perform both application and 
hardware maintenance.
f
f
Application uptime and accessibility is very important.
What assumption may have been made when defining this requirement?
An assumption was made based on the importance of application uptime and accessibility 
that there should be sufficient resources to provide redundancy not only during normal 
operations but also in the event of a host failure, when a host may be unavailable due to 
maintenance being performed.
f
f
Resources should be provided to support a host failure during both normal and host 
maintenance operations
A requirement to support growth in the environment was also defined:
f
f
The business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year
f
f
Support growth over the next five years
R002
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers 
over the next five years

The Design Factors
50
An expected growth of 50 customers over the next year was identified, but the design  
is expected to support growth over the next five years. To create this requirement, an 
assumption was made that growth would be the same over years two through five.
f
f
Growth is calculated based on the addition of 50 new customers each year over the 
next five years.
The company may have a forecast for growth that exceeds this. If this assumption is incorrect, 
the design may not meet the defined requirement.
There's more...
Assumptions should be documented in the design document. As with documenting design 
requirements and constraints, use a table for this. Each assumption is assigned an ID,  
so that it can be easily referenced later in the design document.
ID

A001
Sufficient power, cooling, and floor/rack space is available in the datacenter to

Identifying design risks
Risks include anything that may prevent the design from satisfying the requirements.
Design risks include the following:
f
f
Technical risks
f
f
Operational risks
f
f
Financial risks
Risks are often introduced through constraints or assumptions that have not been proven. 
Risks resulting from assumptions are mitigated by validating them.

Chapter 3
51
How to do it...
Throughout the design process, design decisions should mitigate or minimize risks by 
following this process:
1.	 Identify any risks associated with the design requirements or assumptions.
2.	 Validate assumptions to reduce the risks associated with them.
3.	 Determine how design decisions will help mitigate or minimize risks.
How it works...
There are a few risks in the design based on the discovery information, assumption,  
and constraints.
As part of the discovery process, the following risk was noted:
f
f
Currently, there is no shared storage. The current system and infrastructure 
administrators are unfamiliar with the shared storage concepts and protocols.
These operational risks were identified during discovery. The operational risks can be 
minimized by providing implementation and operational documentation.
There is a technical constraint that may also introduce risks is as follows:
C001
HP DL360 servers should be used for compute resources
This constraint may introduce some risks to the environment if the capabilities of the HP 
DL360 servers are not able to fulfill the requirements. Can the servers be configured with the 
processing and memory required by the requirements? Are there enough expansion slots to 
support the number of network ports or HBAs required? It may be necessary to remove or 
change this constraint if the HP DL360 server is not able to fulfill the technical requirements 
of the design.
An assumption was also made with regards to the growth of the environment over the next  
five years.
f
f
Growth is calculated based on the addition of 50 new customers each year over the 
next five years
If this assumption is not validated and growth is forecasted by the company to be higher in 
two to five years, the design will be at risk to not meet the growth requirements. Validating  
this assumption will mitigate this risk.

The Design Factors
52
Creating the conceptual design
The conceptual design is created with the documentation of the requirements, constraints, and 
assumptions. The design documentation should include a list of each of the design factors. The 
conceptual design guides the design. All logical and physical design elements can be mapped 
back to the conceptual design in order to provide justifications for design decisions.
How to do it...
To create the conceptual design, follow the given steps:
1.	 Use the design factors to form the conceptual design.
2.	 Organize the design factors to be easily referenced during the design process.
3.	 Create high-level diagrams that document the functional blocks of the design.
How it works...
The conceptual design should include a brief overview that describes the key goals of the 
project and any factors that may drive the business decisions related to the project. The 
conceptual design includes all the identified requirements, constraints, and assumptions.
The following paragraphs explain an example of conceptual design:
The primary goal of this project is to lower hardware cost through the consolidation of physical 
application servers. The design will increase application uptime and resiliency and reduce 
application recovery time.
The design will attempt to adhere to the standards and best practices when these align with 
the requirements and constraints of the design.
Design requirements
Requirements are the key demands on the design. The design requirements are as follows:
ID
Requirement
R001
Consolidate the existing 100 physical application servers down to five servers
R002
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers over the 
next five years
R003
Server hardware maintenance should not affect application uptime
R004
Provide N+2 redundancy to support hardware failure during normal and 
maintenance operations

Chapter 3

Design constraints
Constraints limit the logical decisions and physical specifications. Constraints may or may not 
align with the design objectives. The design constraints are as follows:
ID
Constraint
C001
HP DL360 servers should be used for compute resources
C002
A project budget of $200,000
C003

Assumptions
Assumptions are the expectations of a system that have not yet been confirmed. If the 
assumptions are not validated, risks may be introduced. Assumptions are as follows:
ID
Assumption
A001
There is sufficient power, cooling, and floor/rack space available in the datacenter

A003

The conceptual design can also include diagrams that provide high-level overviews of the 
proposed design. Conceptual diagrams of the functional blocks of the design include the 
virtualization infrastructure, storage, servers, and networking. A conceptual diagram does not 
include specifics about resources required or hardware vendors. The following is an example 
of a conceptual diagram that shows how the virtualization infrastructure will leverage the 
existing physical network:

The diagram shows, at a very high level, how servers will be placed in a vSphere High 
Availability (HA) / Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) cluster. The existing physical 
network infrastructure will be leveraged to provide connectivity for IP Storage and the virtual 
machine networks. The diagram does not include any specifics about the type of servers, type 
of array, or the resources required, but it does provide an overview of how the different parts 
of the design will work together.

Introduction
This chapter discusses the design considerations that should be taken into account when 
designing the management layer of the virtual infrastructure. We will look at the different 
components that make up vCenter and how to size them correctly. This chapter also covers 
the different deployment options for vCenter and its components as well as the importance  
of availability, recoverability, and security of these components. The following diagram displays 
how management design is integrated into the design process:

Identifying vCenter components and 
dependencies
The vCenter Server provides the central configuration and management of the ESXi servers 
and the services provided by the virtual infrastructure. vCenter 5.1 is composed of several 
components and services such as the VMware Single Sign-On (SSO) server, the vCenter 
Inventory Service, the vCenter Server, and the vSphere Web Client.

Chapter 4
57
How to do itâ¦
Identify the following core components and services of vCenter 5.1:
f
f
VMware SSO: This provides identity management for administrators, users, 
and applications that interact with the VMware vSphere environment. Multiple 
Active Directory (AD) domains and Open Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
(OpenLDAP) authentication sources can be added to provide authentication to the 
vCenter management components.
f
f
VMware vCenter Inventory Service: This maintains application and inventory data, 
so inventory objects including datacenters, clusters, folders, and virtual machines 
can be searched and accessed.
f
f
VMware vCenter Server: This provides the configuration, access control, and 
performance monitoring of ESXi/ESX hosts and virtual machines that have been 
added to the inventory of the vCenter Server.
f
f
VMware vSphere Web Client: This allows the connections made to vCenter to 
manage objects in its inventory, using a web browser. Many of the new features and 
capabilities in Version 5.1 can only be configured and managed using the VMware 
vSphere Web Client.
How it worksâ¦
Each vCenter Server component or service has a set of dependencies. The following diagram 
illustrates these dependencies:
Authentication source
AD/OpenLDAP
V
ware Single Sign-On
M
Web Client
VMware Inventory
Service
VMware vCenter Server
Database
There's moreâ¦
The vCenter 5.1 installation CD includes several other tools that provide support and 
automation to deploy, manage, patch, and monitor the vSphere virtual environment.  
These tools can be installed on the same server as other vCenter Server components or  
on a separate server. The tools included in the vSphere virtual environment are as follows:
f
f
VMware vSphere Update Manager (VUM): This provides a central automated patch 
and version management for ESXi hosts and virtual appliances

The vSphere Management Design
58
f
f
ESXi Dump Collector: This collects memory dumps over the network in the event of 
an ESXi host encountering a critical error
f
f
VMware vSphere Syslog Collector: This enables network logging and combines the 
logs from multiple hosts
f
f
VMware vSphere Auto Deploy: This provides the automated deployment and 
configuration of ESXi hosts
f
f
VMware vSphere Authentication Proxy: This allows hosts to join a domain without 
using AD credentials
Selecting a vCenter deployment option
There are a number of deployment options available for deploying vCenter. The vCenter Server 
can be deployed on a dedicated physical server running a 64-bit Windows server operating 
system, on a virtual machine running a 64-bit Windows server guest operating system, or on a 
Linux-based virtual appliance. All vCenter components can be installed on a single server, or 
the components can be installed on separate virtual or physical machines.
How to do itâ¦
Regardless of the deployment option selected, the vCenter Server components must be 
installed and configured in a specific order so that the service dependencies are met.
The order of installation of the vCenter Server components is as follows:
1.	 vCenter SSO
2.	 VMware vCenter Inventory Service
3.	 VMware vCenter Server
4.	 VMware vSphere Web Client
5.	 Other vCenter tools and plugins (VUM, third-party plugins, and so on)

Chapter 4

The following diagram illustrates the order of installation of the vCenter Server components:

How it worksâ¦
Deploying the vCenter Server components on a virtual machine is a VMware recommended 
practice. When vCenter is deployed on a virtual machine, it is possible to take advantage 
of the portability and availability provided by the virtual infrastructure. One of the primary 
advantages of deploying vCenter components on virtual machines is that VMware High 
Availability (HA) can be leveraged to protect the management environment from a hardware 
failure or a virtual machine crash.
vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) is a preconfigured Linux-based virtual machine that  
has been optimized to run the vCenter Server and the associated services. It includes  
a PostgreSQL-embedded database that can be used for small deployments of five hosts  
and 50 virtual machines. A remote database connection can be configured to support  
larger deployments.
Limitations of the VCSA are as follows:
f
f
Microsoft SQL is not supported as a remote database.
f
f
VUM must be installed on a separate Windows server.
f
f
vCenter Linked Mode is not supported.
f
f
If the VCSA SSO server is used, it is configured in the basic mode. SSO must  
be installed on a separate Windows server if high availability or multisite  
modes are required.

The vSphere Management Design
60
The vCenter Linked Mode creates groups of vCenter Servers that can be managed centrally. 
Logging into one member of the vCenter Linked Mode group allows an administrator to view 
and manage the inventories of all the vCenter Servers in the group. VMware SSO now provides 
a similar functionality to all the vCenter Servers that are registered with the same SSO server, 
when managing them through the Web Client. The vCenter Linked Mode is available only when 
deploying the vCenter Server on a virtual or physical Windows server. The vCenter Linked 
Mode is not available with the VCSA.
The SSO server, vCenter Inventory Services, vCenter Server, vSphere Web Client server, and 
VUM can all be installed on a single Windows server, or each component can be installed 
on a separate server. Installing all the components on a single server simplifies deployment, 
while installing each component on a separate server allows the resources for each service 
to be adjusted as necessary. This flexibility may be useful in larger deployments but it adds 
complexity to the deployment.
Determining the vCenter system 
requirements
The minimum system requirements for the vCenter Server service are two CPUs of 2.0 GHz 
or faster and 4 GB of memory. When other services are installed on the vCenter Server or in 
larger environments, these minimum requirements may not provide the resources necessary 
to support vCenter deployment.
The size of the vCenter inventory, the number of hosts, and the number of virtual machines also 
have an impact on the amount of CPU and memory resources required. The minimum system 
requirements will support a small deployment of up to five hosts and 50 virtual machines.
How to do itâ¦
The following steps will help you to determine the vCenter system requirements:
1.	 Estimate the number of host and virtual machines that will be managed by the 
vCenter Server.
2.	 Determine whether all the vCenter Server components will be installed on a single 
server or on separate servers.
3.	 Size the vCenter Server to support the managed inventory.

Chapter 4
61
How it worksâ¦
The vCenter Server 5.1 system requirements based on inventory size are given in the  
following table:
Inventory size
Number of 2 GHz 
CPU cores
Memory
Size of database
50 hosts / 500 virtual machines
2
4 GB
5 GB
300 hosts / 3000 virtual machines
4
8 GB
10 GB
1,000 hosts / 10,000 virtual 
machines
8
16 GB
10 GB
If the vCenter Server has been deployed on a Windows virtual machine, enable Memory 
Hot Add and CPU Hot Plug in the virtual machine configuration. This will allow the CPU and 
memory resources to be added to the virtual machine without impacting the virtual machine 
uptime. This is shown in the following screenshot:

The vSphere Management Design
62
The vCenter Server components can be installed on separate physical or virtual machines. 
The following table lists the minimum requirements for each component, if the services are 
installed on separate physical or virtual machines:
Component
2 GHz CPU cores
Memory
Disk size
VMware SSO
2
3 GB
2 GB
Inventory Service
2

60 GB
Web Client

2 GB
If the SSO, vCenter Inventory Service, and vCenter Server are all installed on the same 
machine, the recommended minimum requirements are two CPUs of 2 GHz and 10 GB of 
RAM. If the databases are installed on the same machine, additional CPU, memory, and disk 
resources will be necessary.
The vCenter Server 5.1 virtual appliance is deployed with a configuration of 2 vCPUs and 8 GB 
of memory. The default can be adjusted based on the size of the inventory the appliance has 
to manage.
The vCenter Server virtual appliance memory requirements are given in the following table:
Inventory size
Memory
10 hosts / 100 virtual machines
4 GB
100 hosts / 1,000 virtual machines
8 GB
400 hosts / 4,000 virtual machines
16 GB
> 400 hosts / > 4,000 virtual machines
24 GB
All the necessary vCenter components are preinstalled and optimized on the vCenter Server 
virtual appliance. This includes the VMware SSO service, the vCenter Inventory Services, the 
vCenter Server, and the Web Client Server. The appliance also includes vSphere, the Syslog 
Collector, and the ESXi Dump Collector.
VUM cannot be deployed on the vCenter Server virtual appliance. If VUM is required in an 
environment managed by the virtual appliance, it must be installed on a separate physical or 
virtual environment supported by the Windows server.
There's moreâ¦
VMware and third-party plugins may require their own resources. For example, if VUM is 
installed on the same machine as other vCenter components, the CPU, memory, and disk  
size requirements will need to be adjusted to support the additional resources required.

Chapter 4
63
Selecting a database for vCenter 
deployment
The vCenter SSO, vCenter Server, and VUM each require a supported database to be deployed.
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following steps to select a database for the vCenter deployment:
1.	 Estimate the number of host and virtual machines that will be managed by the 
vCenter Server.
2.	 Choose a supported database platform that is suitable to support the  
vCenter inventory.
How it worksâ¦
The database stores configuration and performance information. The three database 
deployment options are as follows:
f
f
Use the embedded database on the VCSA or the bundled SQL Express database if 
installing vCenter on a Windows server
f
f
Install a full database server locally on the same server as the vCenter  
Server components
f
f
Connect to a database hosted on a remote server
The embedded database on the vCenter Server virtual appliance or the SQL Server Express, 
which can be deployed as part of the vCenter Server Windows install, is intended for small 
deployments of up to five hosts and 50 virtual machines. If the beginning inventory size is 
greater than five hosts and 50 virtual machines or there is expected growth beyond five hosts 
and 50 virtual machines, a different database option should be selected.
Reasons to use the embedded or SQL Express database are as follows:
f
f
A small environment of less than five hosts and 50 virtual machines with no  
expected growth
f
f
Easy to install and configure
f
f
Free! No need to license a separate database server software

The vSphere Management Design
64
Databases are created as part of the installation process when using the 
bundled SQL Express or embedded database option with the SSO and vCenter 
Server. If a full installation of a database server is used, these databases and 
the ODBC connections required for them are manually created.
Installing a full SQL or Oracle database locally on the same Windows server as the vCenter 
components is supported, but this increases the amount of resources necessary for the 
vCenter Server. Additional memory up to 4 GB may be required depending on the size of the 
vCenter inventory. Hosting the database locally on the same server is fully supported and can 
provide faster access since the access to the database does not rely on network resources.
Reasons to choose a locally installed database are as follows:
f
f
Fast database access, which is not dependent on network resources
f
f
If using a SQL database, the vCenter Server components and the required databases 
can be protected using vCenter Server Heartbeat
A full installation of SQL or Oracle can also be performed on a separate physical or virtual 
machine. The vCenter components access the databases hosted on the remote database 
server. The creation of the databases and the configuration of the vCenter components is 
the same as with a full database installation on the same server as vCenter. Accessing the 
databases requires network resources; because of this, a network congestion or a network 
outage can affect the accessibility of the databases.
Reasons to choose a remotely installed database are as follows:
f
f
Leverage an existing database server already available in the environment.
f
f
Separation of roles is another reason. Database administrators are responsible for 
administering the database servers, while virtual administrators are responsible for 
administering the virtual environment.
f
f
High availability to the databases can be provided using Microsoft or Oracle clustering.
f
f
Reduces the amount of resources that need to be allocated to the vCenter Server.
There's moreâ¦
If installing the SQL Express database to support the vCenter 5.1 Server on a Windows server, 
download and install SQL Server 2008 R2 Management Studio Express from Microsoft at 
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22985. This 
will provide a management interface to the SQL Express databases created by the SSO and 
vCenter Server installation.
If SQL Express is used and the environment grows beyond five hosts and 50 virtual machines, 
the databases can be migrated to a Standard, Enterprise, or Datacenter Edition of SQL  
server installation.

Determining database interoperability
VMware provides an online interoperability matrix in order to make it easy to determine which 
database versions are compatible and supported with which versions of VMware products.
How to do itâ¦
In order to determine database interoperability with VMware products, perform the  
following steps:
1.	 Visit http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/sim/interop_
matrix.php.
2.	 Select the Solution/Database Interoperability radio button.
3.	 In the Select a VMware Product option, select VMware vCenter Server and a 
Version from the respective drop-down boxes.
4.	 Add database versions using the database drop-down box. You can add multiple 
database versions.

The vSphere Management Design
66
The database's compatibility with the selected product will be displayed in the table. Hovering 
over the green check will display more specific information about the supported option.
How it works...
Verifying database product interoperability ensures the supportability of the database and the 
version that has been selected for use with a specific VMware product. The VMware Product 
Interoperability Matrixes are regularly updated by VMware when new database or VMware 
product versions are released.
Database and product interoperability should be checked for new installations, and this should 
be done prior to upgrading VMware products or applying service packs to database servers.
There's moreâ¦
The interoperability matrix can be used to determine database operability for all supported 
VMware products and solutions. It can also be used to determine supported upgrade paths 
and interoperability between different VMware solutions.
Choosing a vCenter Single Sign-On 
deployment mode
In vSphere 5.1, there are three deployment modes available for the vCenter SSO server. These 
are as follows:
f
f
Basic mode
f
f
High availability cluster mode
f
f
Multisite mode
The deployment mode that is chosen depends on the requirements of the design. Is high 
availability required? Will there be a SSO server located at multiple sites? Will vCenter  
Linked Mode be used? This recipe takes a look at the different deployment modes and  
how they are used.
SSO has been rewritten, and the deployment has been simplified in vSphere 5.5.  
vSphere 5.5 provides a single deployment option for single or multiple sites. The  
dependency on an external database has also been removed in vSphere 5.5.

Chapter 4
67
How to do itâ¦
To determine the SSO deployment mode for a vSphere 5.1 deployment, follow these steps:
1.	 Identify the use cases for each SSO deployment mode.
2.	 Select the SSO deployment mode based on the environment requirements.
How it worksâ¦
Basic mode deploys a standalone version of the SSO server. This is the most common 
deployment option and will meet the requirements of most environments. Multiple AD and 
OpenLDAP identity sources can be configured on an SSO server installed in basic mode. Local 
operating system identity sources can also be configured. If the SSO server is used with the 
vCenter Server virtual appliance, basic mode is the only available option.
Multiple vCenter Servers and multiple vCenter Inventory Services can be registered with the 
SSO server configured in basic mode. All the registered vCenter Servers can be managed 
by the vSphere Web Client. However, if the SSO server is unavailable, administrators will not 
be able to authenticate and will not be able to access the vCenter Server using the vSphere 
Client or the Web Client.
The following diagram illustrates how vCenter services authenticate against the SSO server 
deployed in basic mode:
Single Sign-On
basic mode
vCenter Inventory
Service
vCenter Server
SSO database
Identity sources
vCenter Server
vCenter Inventory
Service
High availability cluster mode installs two or more vCenter SSO servers in a high  
availability cluster configuration. This is the most complex installation mode since it  
requires a third-party load balancer to determine if the SSO server has failed and then  
redirect authentication requests to another SSO server in the cluster.
Each SSO server installed in high availability mode uses the same database and contains the 
same AD or OpenLDAP identity sources. High availability mode does not support using local 
operating system user accounts for authentication.

The vSphere Management Design
68
A load balancer that is enabled by a third-party Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is required to 
facilitate failover between the SSO servers configured in high availability cluster mode. The 
load balancer should be configured to provide failover only. Load balancing between SSO 
servers configured in high availability mode is not supported.
The following diagram illustrates how vCenter services authenticate against SSO deployed in 
high availability cluster mode:
Single Sign-On
High Availability
vCenter Inventory
Service
vCenter Inventory
Service
Single Sign-On
High Availability
vCenter Server

Identity sources

vCenter Server
In a deployment where servers are installed at multiple locations, SSO servers can be 
installed in multisite mode to provide faster access by allowing access to the authentication 
services that are local to the vCenter Server they support. Each SSO server in a multisite 
deployment has its own database and is configured to AD and OpenLDAP sources located 
at the same location. Multisite mode is required when using vCenter Linked Mode between 
vCenter Servers at multiple sites.
The following diagram illustrates how vCenter services authenticate against SSO deployed in 
multisite mode:
vCenter Inventory
Service
vCenter Server

Chapter 4
69
Multisite mode does not provide failover between the SSO servers at different sites. If the SSO 
server at one site fails, vCenter authentication at that site will also fail even if SSO servers at 
other sites are still functional.
There's moreâ¦
Regardless of the mode chosen, the SSO server database is separated from the vCenter 
Server database. A periodic of Sign-On configuration and database should be taken, so it  
can be restored in the event of a system failure or database corruption.
The procedure for backing up and restoring the SSO configuration can be found in this 
VMware knowledge base article at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2034928. The SSO 
database should be backed up using the method supported by the database server software.
Designing for management availability
The availability of the management functions of an environment becomes more critical; for 
example, in virtual desktop environments and other self-service provisioning environments. 
In these environments, if the vCenter Server is unavailable, so is the ability to provide the 
provisioning of services.
If the environment does not provide these type of services, the ability to manage the 
environment, especially during a failure or disaster, is also critical. How can you troubleshoot 
an issue with a virtual machine or a group of virtual machines if the primary tool that is used 
to manage the environment is unavailable?
How to do itâ¦
To properly design for management availability, follow these steps:
1.	 Identify management environment dependencies.
2.	 Identify the potential single points of failure in the management environment.
3.	 Create a management design that ensures high availability of the  
management components.
How it worksâ¦
When designing the management network, single points of failure should be minimized. 
Redundant network connections and multiple network interfaces connected to separate 
physical switches should be configured to provide connectivity.

The vSphere Management Design
70
The storage that hosts the management components should be configured to support  
the capacity and performance of the management components. The storage should  
also be configured to be highly available, so that a disk or path failure does not interrupt 
management operations.
If the vCenter Server is running on a virtual machine, it can be protected with HA. If the host 
that vCenter is running on or the operating system crashes, the vCenter Server is restarted 
on a surviving host. There will be some downtime associated with the failure, but the vCenter 
Server services will be restored.
In environments where the vCenter Server provides provisioning, such as a virtual desktop or 
self-service cloud environments, the vCenter uptime is critical. In environments where vCenter 
is installed on a physical machine and HA is not an option, vCenter Server Heartbeat can be 
used to protect the vCenter Server. vCenter Server Heartbeat protects the vCenter Server, the 
supporting components, and the databases from network, hardware, and application failures. 
Design considerations for using vCenter Server Heartbeat to protect the vCenter Server are 
covered in detail in the Using vCenter Server Heartbeat to provide availability recipe later in 
this chapter.
Sufficient resources should be dedicated to the vCenter Server and its components. We 
discussed correct sizing of the vCenter Server earlier in the chapter. Sizing vCenter correctly 
and reserving resources ensures not only performance but also availability. If a virtual 
machine is running on the same host as the vCenter Server or one of its components and it 
consumes too much of the host resources, it may impact the performance and availability 
of the vCenter Server services. Applying resource reservations to the vCenter Server will 
prevent resource contention. Another means of preventing resource contention is by designing 
a separate cluster to host the management components. Management cluster design is 
discussed in the Designing a separate management cluster recipe in this chapter.
Backing up the vCenter Server components
In order to recover the vCenter Server components in the event of an outage that results 
in data loss or data corruption, it is necessary to perform backups of the databases and 
the vCenter Server configurations. The vCenter SSO, the vCenter Inventory Service, and the 
vCenter Server each have specific configuration information that should be backed up.
The frequency of backups depends on the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) that has been 
defined for the management environment. The RPO defines the maximum period of data loss 
that can be tolerated as a result of an outage. If the RPO has been determined to be four 
hours, this means backups should occur at least every four hours.

Chapter 4
71
How to do itâ¦
If the VCSA with the embedded database is used, a backup of the database can be taken 
using the following procedure:
1.	 Secure Shell (SSH) into the vCenter Server virtual appliance.
2.	 Change the path to /opt/vmware/vpostgres/1.0/bin.
3.	 Run ./ pg_dumpÂ EMB_DB_INSTANCEÂ -UÂ EMB_DB_USERÂ -Fp -c > Backup_
Filename.
4.	 Enter the EMB_DB_PASSWORD when prompted.
5.	 The configuration file located at /etc/vmware-vpx/embedded_db.cfg contains 
the EMB_DB_INSTANCE, EMB_DB_USER, and EMB_DB_PASSWORD values.
Back up the vCenter SSL certificates using the following steps:
1.	 The rui.key file is the private key, the rui.crt file is the certificate, and the rui.
pfx file is the concatenation of the rui.key and rui.crt files in the PFX format. All 
of these files are required and should be backed up.
2.	 The vCenter SSL certificates' location depends on the operating system on  
which the vCenter Server has been installed. These files can be stored at the 
following locations:
Â
Â
For Windows Server 2008, these files are located at C:\ProgramData\
VMware\VMware VirtualCenter\SSL
Â
Â
For Windows Server 2003, these files are located at C:\Documents 
and Settings\All Users\Application Data\VMware\VMware 
VirtualCenter\SSL
Â
Â
On the vCenter Server virtual appliance, the files are located at /etc/
vmware-vpx/ssl
To back up the vCenter Inventory Service on a Windows server, use the following steps:
1.	 Stop the VMware vCenter Inventory Service using services.msc.
2.	 Open a command prompt and change the path of the folder to that of the vCenter 
Inventory Service installed at directory\Infrastructure\Inventory 
Service\scripts and run the script backup.bat using the following commands:
> cd vCenter_Install_Directory\Infrastructure\Inventory Service\
scripts
> backup.bat -file backup_filename
3.	 When the backup is completed, the message Backup Completed successfully will be 
displayed. Start the VMware vCenter Inventory Service using services.msc.

The vSphere Management Design
72
To back up the vCenter Inventory Service on the VCSA, complete the following steps:
1.	 Log in to the vCenter Server virtual appliance as root.
2.	 Stop the vCenter Inventory Service by running the following command:
# serviceservicevmware-inventory-service stop
3.	 Change the path of the folder to /usr/lib/vmware-vpx/inventoryservice/
scripts/ and run the script backup.sh using the following commands:
# cd /usr/lib/vmware-vpx/inventoryservice/scripts
# ./backup.sh -file backup_filename
4.	 When the backup is completed, the message Backup Completed successfully will be 
displayed. Restart the vCenter Inventory Service using the following command:
# serviceservicevmware-inventory-service start
To back up the SSO Configuration, follow these steps:
1.	 Open a command prompt using Run as administrator.
2.	 Change the path of the folder to that of the vCenter SSO installed at directory\
Infrastructure\SSOServer\scripts and run the sso-backup.wsf script 
using the following commands:
>cdSSO_install_directory\Infrastructure\SSOServer\scripts
> cscript sso-backup.wsf /z
3.	 The vCenter SSO configuration backup is stored in a ZIP file, Single Sign On.zip, 
located on the administrator's desktop.
How it works...
How backups are done depends on the database software that is used to host the database. 
For example, if the database is a Microsoft SQL database, a backup can be performed on 
demand in the SQL Management Studio or as a scheduled SQL job. Third-party backup tools 
can also be used to back up the vCenter and SSO databases.
The vCenter Server database and the SSO database should be backed up regularly, 
depending on the RPO that has been defined for the management components.
SSL certificates are used by the vCenter Server to encrypt communications between the ESXi 
hosts in the environment. The database password is encrypted using the certificates, so the 
certificates are also required for vCenter to access its database. These SSL certificates should 
be regularly backed up.
The vCenter Inventory Service, SSO configurations, and even the database should be backed 
up to ensure that each of these services can be restored.

Chapter 4
73
There's moreâ¦
There are a number of third-party tools available that can be leveraged to back up virtual 
machines. If the vCenter Server components are installed on a virtual machine or if the 
vCenter Server virtual appliance is deployed, these third-party tools can be used to take full 
virtual machine backups. This simplifies the backup and recovery process. These third-party 
backup tools also simplify backup testing since the full virtual machine can be recovered in an 
isolated or sandbox environment.
Using vCenter Server Heartbeat to provide 
vCenter availability
vCenter Server Heartbeat is a separately licensed product available from VMware that 
provides high availability clustering of VMware vCenter Server. vCenter Server Heartbeat can 
be used to protect both the vCenter Server components and the vCenter databases from 
operating system, application, network, and hardware failures. vCenter Server Heartbeat can 
only be used to protect the vCenter Server deployed on a Windows server. It cannot be used to 
protect the vCenter Server virtual appliance.
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following steps for using vCenter Server Hearbeat to provide availability:
1.	 Identify the use cases for protecting the vCenter Server with vCenter Server Heartbeat.
2.	 Understand the architecture of the vCenter Server Heartbeat cluster.
How it worksâ¦
vCenter Server Heartbeat provides multiple methods of protection, which include  
Physical-to-Virtual (P2V), Virtual-to-Virtual (V2V), and Physical-to-Physical (P2P). Protection 
can be provided over the Local Area Network (LAN) for high availability or over the Wide Area 
Network (WAN) for disaster recovery.
The vCenter Server Heartbeat software is installed on a primary or production server and a 
secondary or ready-standby server. The primary server assumes the active role during normal 
operations, while the secondary server assumes the passive role. The active server is visible 
on the network using the Principal IP address, and the passive server is hidden from the 
public network until a switchover or failover operation changes the roles of the primary and 
secondary servers.
A separate control channel is used to provide communications between the vCenter Servers 
being protected. Each server requires two IP addresses, one for the control channel and one 
for management.

The vSphere Management Design
74
The control channels of the communications between the active and passive server and 
controls failover and data transfers from the active server to the passive server. The control 
channel is also used by the passive server to monitor the active server's status. The control 
channel can use the same interface as the principal network, but using a separate dedicated 
Network Interface Controller (NIC) for the control channel is recommended. The following 
diagram shows the network channel between the active and passive servers:
The Principal IP address is used to access the services on the active server. This IP address 
can be moved between the primary and secondary server when roles are switched from active 
to passive. When a switch or failover occurs, the Principal IP address is removed from the 
previously active server and reassigned to the new active server.
The Management IP address is used to access the server when it is in the passive role. The 
Management IP address is a static address on the same network interface and on the same 
subnet as the Principal IP address. This address is used by administrators to manage the 
passive server.
vCenter Server Heartbeat can protect vCenter across the WAN. The requirements for 
protecting vCenter over the WAN with vCenter Server Heartbeat are as follows:
f

A routable IP address for the channel network

Minimum 1 MB of bandwidth between sites

Rights to add/update/remove DNS records

Securing the management components
Securing the management components is critical. If the vCenter Server is compromised, a 
great deal of damage can be done, from powering off virtual machines to completely deleting 
virtual machines from disks.
We will not dive deep into the configuration of security, instead we will just take a look at some 
of the key best practices that should be considered when designing the management layer.
How to do itâ¦
There are a number of security practices that can be implemented to harden the management 
environment as follows:
f
f
Place the vCenter Server and other management components on a separate physical 
network or Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). Providing a network separation of the 
management components from production networks used by virtual machines makes 
it easier to configure firewall access to the management components.
f
f
Use VUM to apply critical security patches to hosts. ESXi already has a very small 
attack service, but critical security patches are released from time to time and should 
be installed as soon as possible.
f
f
Set permissions on vCenter inventory objects based on roles. Everyone who 
accesses the vCenter Server should not be set up as an administrator. Use roles and 
permissions to assign only the necessary permissions that a user needs in order to 
perform his/her role.
f
f
Replace self-signed certificates with Certificate Authority (CA) signed user 
certificates. Communication with and between vCenter components is secured  
using SSL certificates. The default SSL certificates are self-signed certificates  
that are created during installation. These self-signed certificates are vulnerable 
to man-in-the-middle attacks since the certificate warnings are commonly ignored. 
The PDF document from VMware on replacing SSL certificates can be found at 
http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/vsp_51_vcserver_esxi_
certificates.pdf.
f
f
Use ESXi lockdown mode on hosts managed by vCenter. Lockdown mode ensures 
that all access to ESXi hosts is authenticated by the vCenter Server. Once lockdown 
mode is enabled, direct access to the host is no longer available except through the 
Direct Console User Interface (DCUI).

The vSphere Management Design
76
ESXi lockdown mode is used very rarely, and I do not understand why this is the case. 
Environment security is greatly increased by limiting the ability to directly access ESXi hosts. 
Lockdown mode can be enabled when first adding a host to the vCenter inventory. Lockdown 
mode can be easily disabled and enabled at any time in order to directly access a host if 
necessary for support or troubleshooting. The following screenshot displays the lockdown 
mode host configuration in the vSphere Web Client:
When lockdown mode is enabled, the host can still be managed using the vSphere  
Client connected to the managing vCenter Server, VMware PowerCLI, or VMware vSphere 
Command-Line Interface (vCLI). The only difference is that access is authenticated through 
the vCenter Server, instead of using a local account on the ESXi host. While lockdown mode is 
enabled, access to the host through SSH is unavailable.
There's moreâ¦
Beyond applying best practice for securing vCenter components, best practice for securing the 
operating systems hosting the vCenter components should also be applied. This best practice 
is as follows:
f
f
Unnecessary services should be removed or disabled
f
f
Windows firewall should be correctly configured to allow access to the  
management services
f
f
Windows security updates should be applied when available
f
f
Access to the operating system should be tightly controlled

Chapter 4
77
Designing a separate management cluster
The management components of a virtual environment can be resource intensive. If you are 
running vCenter and its dependencies as virtual machines in the same cluster as the cluster 
managed by the vCenter server, the resources required by the management infrastructure 
must be factorized into the capacity calculations of the logical design. Creating a separate 
management cluster separates the resources required by the vCenter components from the 
resources required by the applications hosted in the virtual infrastructure.
How to do itâ¦
Management cluster best practice is as follows:
f
f
CPU and memory resources to support management applications
f
f
Multiple network interfaces and multiple physical network switches to minimize the 
single points of failure in the management network
f
f
Multiple paths to the storage in order to minimize the single points of failure in the 
storage network
f
f
Storage designed to support both the capacity and the performance required for 
management applications
To correctly size the management cluster, the services that will be hosted in the cluster need 
to be identified. The following questions also need to be answered:
f
f
Will the cluster also provide the resources needed for the vCenter or SSO databases?
f
f
What about other management tools, such as vCenter Operations Manager, vCenter 
Log Insight, or other third-party management tools?
How it worksâ¦
The design of a management cluster follows the same process as designing a cluster  
hosting the production applications. Requirements need to be identified and the logical  
design process for storage, networking, and computing resources must be followed. 
Functional requirements for the management network will likely include high availability, 
minimizing single points of failure, and quickly recovering failed components.

The vSphere Management Design
78
There's moreâ¦
When vCenter Server Heartbeat is used to protect the vCenter Server running on a virtual 
machine, anti-affinity rules can be used to ensure that the primary and secondary servers run 
on separate hosts within the cluster. This prevents both the primary and secondary servers 
from running on the same host, which reduces the likelihood of a hardware failure impacting 
the vCenter operations.
Affinity rules can also be used to keep virtual machines together. For example, keeping the 
virtual machine running the vCenter Server and the virtual machine running the vCenter 
Server database on the same host reduces the load on the physical network since all 
communication between the two servers never leaves the internal host network.
If hosting vCenter in the same cluster, affinity and anti-affinity rules can be used to keep the 
vCenter Server running on specific hosts so that it can be easily located in the event of the 
vCenter Server being unavailable.

Introduction
Storage is an essential component of vSphere design and provides the foundation for 
the vSphere environment. A solid storage design that addresses capacity, performance, 
availability, and recoverability is the key to a successful vSphere design. The following  
diagram displays how a storage design is integrated into the design process:

The vSphere Storage Design
80
Several storage options and protocols are supported in a vSphere environment. The 
architecture chosen for a vSphere deployment depends on the capabilities and features 
needed to meet the design requirements.
This chapter will cover calculating the storage capacity and performance requirements, sizing 
datastores, and selecting a storage protocol. The calculations for the recipes in this chapter 
will be based on the following requirements identified in Chapter 3, The Design Factors:
f
f
There are 100 application servers
f
f
Each application server is configured with 100 GB of disk space. The peak disk 
capacity usage of a single application server is approximately 65 percent of the total 
or 65 GB. The average disk performance of a single application server is 50 IOPS with 
an I/O profile of 90 percent read and 10 percent write.
f
f
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers over the  
next 5 years.
Identifying RAID levels
A Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) combines multiple physical disks into a 
single unit of storage. The advantages in speed, reliability, and capacity can be realized 
depending on which RAID level is selected. RAID provides the first level of protection against 
data loss due to a disk failure.
How to do it...
In order to select the proper RAID level to support the virtual workloads, you need to perform 
the following steps:
1.	 Identify the different RAID levels and capabilities.
2.	 Select an appropriate RAID level to support a virtualized workload based on capacity 
and performance requirements.
How it works...
RAID0 stripes disks together to appear as a single disk with a capacity equal to the sum of all 
the disks in the set. RAID0 provides excellent performance and capacity efficiency, but offers 
no data protection. If a disk fails in a RAID0 set, the data is lost and must be recovered from a 
backup or some other source. Since this level offers no redundancy, it is not a good choice for 
production or mission-critical storage.

Chapter 5
81
The following diagram illustrates the disks in a RAID0 configuration:
RAID1 duplicates or mirrors data from one disk to another. A RAID1 set consists of two disks 
and data is written on both the disks, which can then be read from either disk. If one of the 
disks fails, the mirror can be rebuilt by replacing the disk. The following diagram illustrates 
disks in a RAID1 configuration:
RAID 1+0, RAID1/0, or RAID10 is a stripe of multiple mirrors. RAID10 provides excellent 
redundancy and performance, making this the best option for mission-critical applications. 
RAID10 is well-suited for applications with small, random, write-intensive IOs such as high 
transaction applications, large messaging applications, or large transactional database 
applications. A RAID10 set can recover from multiple drive failures as long as two drives  
in the same mirror set do not fail.
Both RAID1 and RAID10 have a capacity efficiency of 50 percent since half of the disks in a 
RAID1 or RAID10 set are used to store the mirrored data. The following diagram illustrates 
disks in a RAID10 configuration:

The vSphere Storage Design
82
In RAID5, data is striped across several drives and parity is written equally across all the drives 
in the set. The parity allows for the recovery from a failure of a single drive in the set. This 
level offers a balance of performance and capacity and is suitable for storing transactional 
databases, web servers, application servers, file servers, and mail servers. The following 
diagram illustrates disks in a RAID5 configuration:
The capacity efficiency of a RAID5 set is calculated using the formula [(n - 1) / n] * 100, where 
n is equal to the number of disks in the set. For example, a RAID5 set containing four 100 GB 
disks would provide 75 percent of the total capacity or 300 GB.
[(4-1)/4]*100 = 75%
(100GB * 4) * .75 = 300GB
RAID6 is similar to RAID5, except that the two parity blocks are written and distributed equally 
across all the drives in the set. The second parity increases the write penalty but protects 
against two drive failures in the set. File archiving and file servers are common workloads 
hosted on RAID6.
The capacity efficiency of a RAID6 set is calculated using the formula [(n - 2) / n] * 100, where 
n is equal to the number of disks in the set. A RAID6 set containing six 100 GB disks would 
provide approximately 67 percent of the total capacity or 400 GB.
[(6 - 2) / 6] * 100 = ~67%
(100GB * 6) * .67 = ~400GB
There's more...
To increase the redundancy of a RAID set, hot spares should be configured in the array. The 
hot spares are used to automatically replace a failed drive in a RAID set temporarily, until the 
failed drive can be replaced. A single hot spare can be configured to provide protection for 
multiple RAID sets.

Chapter 5

Calculating storage capacity requirements
Capacity is usually measured in Gigabytes (GB) or Terabytes (TB). Capacity should include 
the total space needed to support the current, the space needed to support growth, the space 
needed for virtual machine swapfiles, and the additional slack space for snapshots and other 
virtual machine data.
How to do it...
In order to calculate the storage capacity requirements, you need to perform the following steps:
1.	 Determine the capacity required to support the current workloads.
2.	 Determine the capacity required to support future growth.
How it works...
Capacity is calculated to support the current and future growth based on the design 
requirements as follows:
Current Capacity = 100 Virtual Machines x 100 GB = 10 TB
Growth Capacity = 25 Virtual Machines x 100 GB = 2.5 TB
20% Slack space = 12.5 TB x .20 = 2.5 TB
Capacity = 12.5 TB + 2.5 TB = 15 TB
Each virtual machine will have a swapfile or .vswp file that is created when the virtual 
machine is powered on. The size of the .vswp file for each virtual machine is equal to  
the size of the allocated memory minus the memory reservation.
vSwap Capacity = (100 Virtual Machines + 25 Future Virtual Machines) x 8 GB of  
Memory = 1 TB
The total capacity needed to support the requirements is 16 TB.
There's more...
The application servers are configured with 100 GB of disk space, but the maximum space 
that is actually consumed by a server is only 65 GB. Resizing the virtual machine disk or using 
thin provisioning can reduce the required amount of storage capacity significantly.

The vSphere Storage Design
84
Since only the actual used space is consumed, thin provisioning virtual machine disks allows 
for the disk capacity to be over allocated, which means that more capacity can be allocated  
to the virtual machine disks than what is actually available on the datastore. This increases 
the amount of management oversight required to monitor the capacity. vCenter datastore 
alarms can be configured to monitor over allocation and datastore usage to assist in  
capacity management.
Determining storage performance 
requirements
Disk performance is measured in Input/Output per Second (IOPS). One disk read request or 
one disk write request is equal to one I/O.
How to do it...
The IOPS required to support an application is calculated based on the percentage of  
read I/O, the percentage of write I/O, and the write penalty of the RAID level the workload  
will be hosted on.
To calculate the IOPS requirements, perform the following steps:
1.	 Determine the number of IOPS a workload requires.
2.	 Identify the percentage of read I/O to write I/O for the workload.
3.	 Determine the write penalty of the RAID level that will host the workload.
4.	 Calculate the IOPS the storage must be capable of providing to support the workload.
How it works...
To get the total amount of required IOPS, multiply the number of workloads by the number of 
Functional Application IOPS.
Total IOPS = (100 current workloads + 25 future workloads) * 65 IOPS = 8125 IOPS
To calculate the Functional IOPS required for a specific workload, use the following formula:
Functional Workload IOPS = (Workload IOPS * %Reads) + ((Workload IOPS * %Writes)  
* Write Penalty)
The write penalty is based on the number of I/O operations a specific RAID configuration 
requires for a single write request. Writing data to multiple disks in a mirror or parity 
calculations in a RAID5 or RAID6 configuration adds I/O operations to the write request.  
The write request is not completed until the data and parity are written to the disks.

Chapter 5

The following table illustrates the write penalty based on the RAID levels:
RAID
Write Penalty
0
1
1
2

4
6
6
10
2
Based on the requirements of 50 IOPS per workload with 90 percent reads and 10 percent 
writes on the storage configured in RAID5, the actual workload IOPS would be 65 IOPS.
Functional Application IOPS = (50 * .90) + ((50 * .10) * 4) = 65 IOPS
Each disk in a storage array is able to provide a number of IOPS. The number of IOPS a single 
disk can deliver is calculated from the average latency and the average seek time of the disk. 
The formula to calculate disk performance is as follows:
IOPS = 1 / (average latency in milliseconds + average seek time in milliseconds)
The following table lists some approximate IOPS provided, based on the spindle speed and the 
drive type:
Drive Speed
~ IOPS
SSD
> 2500
15k SAS/FC
175
10k SAS/FC
125
7200 NL-SAS/SATA
75
5400 SATA
50
Based on the number of IOPS required, there will be a need of 47 15k SAS drives to support 
the workload.
8125 IOPS / 175 IOPS per Drive = 46.4 or 47 15k SAS drives
The same workload on drives configured in RAID10 sets would require 40 15k SAS drives to 
provide the required IOPS.
Functional Workload IOPS = (50 * .90) + ((50 * .10) * 2) = 55 IOPS
Total IOPS = (100 current workloads + 25 future workloads) * 55 IOPS = 6875 IOPS
6875 IOPS / 175 IOPS per Drive = 39.3 or 40 15k SAS drives

The vSphere Storage Design
86
There's more...
Many arrays provide a caching mechanism using memory or SSD disks to increase the 
number of IOPS the array can deliver. This allows a few slow drives to deliver a higher number 
of IOPS. This caching can greatly reduce the number of drives needed to deliver the same 
number of IOPS by writing to a faster cache instead of writing directly to disks. FAST Cache of 
EMC and Flash Cache of NetApp are examples of vendor-specific SSD caching technologies 
that can be used to increase storage I/O performance.
Calculating storage throughput
The data transfer rate or throughput is the rate at which data can be read from or written to 
the storage device and is typically measured in MB/s.
How to do it...
Throughput should be calculated in order to ensure that the storage controllers and disk can 
support the required data transfer rates. Throughput is also used to correctly size the storage 
connectivity bandwidth.
To calculate storage throughput requirements, perform the following steps:
1.	 Determine the I/O size of the workload.
2.	 Determine the number of IOPS required to support the workload.
3.	 Calculate the throughput required.
How it works...
Throughput is calculated by multiplying the I/O size of the workload by the number of IOPS. 
Transactional databases and application servers typically have an I/O size between 4k 
and 64k, whereas file archiving applications, backup applications, and media streaming 
applications typically have larger I/O sizes from 64k to 1024k.
To calculate the throughput, the following formula is used:
Throughput = Functional Workload IOPS * IO Size
Using the Functional Workload IOPS from the previous recipe and an I/O size of 8k, the 
throughput required can be calculated as follows:
Throughput = 6875 * 8k = 55 MB/s

Chapter 5
87
Network Interface Card bandwidth is usually expressed in Mbps. To convert MB/s to Mbps, 
simply multiply by 8.
Bandwidth Mbps = 55 MB/s * 8 = 440 Mbps
The array would need to support a throughput of atleast 55 MB/s, and the connectivity 
bandwidth would need to be sufficient enough to support atleast 440 Mbps.
Storage connectivity options
vSphere supports multiple storage protocols and connectivity options. Storage can be 
directly connected to a host, or storage can be centralized and shared with multiple hosts. 
Shared storage is required when implementing many vSphere features such as VMware 
High Availability (HA), VMware Fault Tolerance (FT), and VMware Distributed Resource 
Scheduling (DRS).
How to do it...
In order to determine the storage connectivity requirements, perform the following steps:
1.	 Identify the supported storage protocols and connectivity options.
2.	 Select the storage protocol and connectivity that supports the design requirements.
How it works...
Performance, availability, and costs are all factors that should be considered when choosing 
a storage connectivity option. The following table provides a quick overview of the different 
storage connectivity options and how they compare with each other in terms of performance, 
availability, and costs:

Direct attached or local storage is storage directly attached to a host. Since this storage is  
not shared, many VMware features will not be available for virtual machines hosted on the 
local storage.

The vSphere Storage Design
88
Best practices when using Direct attached or local storage are as follows:
f
f
Configure RAID to provide protection against a hard disk failure.
f
f
Use a hardware RAID controller that is on the VMware HCL.
Fibre Channel (FC) is a block-level, low latency, high-performance storage network protocol 
that is well-suited for workloads with high I/O requirements. The FC protocol encapsulates the 
SCSI commands into the FC frames. A Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapter (HBA) is required to 
connect the host to the storage network or fabric. FC HBAs can provide a throughput of 2, 4, 
8, or 16 Gbps depending on the capabilities of the HBA and the FC network. FC uses zoning 
and LUN masking to configure which hosts can connect to which targets on the SAN.
The cost of deploying FC-connected storage can be significantly higher than other options, 
especially if an existing FC infrastructure does not already exist.
The best practices when using FC are as follows:
f
f
Use multiple HBAs in the host to provide multiple paths from load balancing  
and redundancy.
f
f
Ensure all HBAs and switches are configured for the same speed. Mixing the speed of 
HBAs and switches can produce contention at the FC switch and SAN.
f
f
Use single-initiator single-target zoning. A single HBA, the initiator, is zoned to a single 
array target, the target. A separate zone is created for each host HBA.
f
f
Mask LUNs presented to ESXi hosts from other devices.
f
f
Ensure firmware levels on FC switches and HBAs are up-to-date and compatible.
iSCSI provides block-level storage access by encapsulating SCSI commands in TCP/IP. iSCSI 
storage can be accessed with the iSCSI software initiator, included with ESXi through a 
standard network adapter, or using a dependent or independent iSCSI HBA.
f
f
A dependent iSCSI adapter depends on VMware networking and iSCSI configuration 
for connectivity and management.
f
f
An independent iSCSI HBA provides its own networking and configuration for 
connectivity and management. Configuration is done directly on the HBA through  
its own configuration interface.
Throughput is based on the network bandwidth, the speed of the network interface card  
(1 Gbps or 10 GbE), and the CPU resources required to encapsulate the SCSI commands  
into TCP/IP packets.
The cost of implementing iSCSI is typically significantly lesser than implementing FC. Standard 
network adapters and network switches can be used to provide iSCSI connectivity. Using 
dedicated iSCSI HBAs not only increases performance, but also increases cost. The price 
of 10 GbE switches and 10 GbE adapters continues to drop as the deployment of these 
becomes more widespread.

Chapter 5
89
The best practices when using iSCSI are as follows:
f
f
Configure multiple vmks bound to multiple vmnics to provide load balancing and 
redundancy for iSCSI connections.
f
f
Use network cards with TCP/IP Offload Engine (TOE) enabled, to reduce the stress 
on the host CPU.
f
f
Use a physically separate network for iSCSI traffic. If a physically separate network is 
not available, use VLANs to separate iSCSI traffic from other network traffic.
f
f
Enable jumbo frames (MTU 9000) on the iSCSI network.
The Network File System protocol or NFS can be used to access virtual machine files  
stored on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. Virtual machine configuration files,  
disk (VMDK) files, and swap (.vswp) files can be stored on the NAS storage. vSphere currently 
supports NFS Version 3 over TCP. Throughput is based on the network bandwidth, the speed 
of the network interface card (1 Gbps or 10 GbE), and the processing speed of the NAS. 
Multiple paths can be configured for high availability, but load balancing across multiple  
paths is not supported with NFS.
The cost of implementing NFS connectivity is similar to iSCSI. No specialized network 
hardware is required. Standard network switches and network adapters are used and  
there is no need for specialized HBAs.
The best practices when using NFS-connected storage are as follows:
f
f
Use a physically separate network for NFS traffic. If a physically separate network is 
not available, use VLANs to separate NFS traffic from other network traffic.
f
f
Hosts must mount NFS exports with root access.
f
f
Enable jumbo frames (MTU 9000) on the NFS network.
Fibre Channel of Ethernet (FCoE) encapsulates Fibre Channel in Ethernet frames. A 
Converged Network Adapter (CNA) that supports FCoE is required or a network adapter  
with FCoE capabilities can be used with the software FCoE initiator included with ESXi.
A common implementation of FCoE is with Cisco UCS blade chassis. The connectivity for 
TCP/IP network and FCoE storage traffic is converged between the chassis and the Fabric 
Interconnects. The Fabric Interconnects splits out the traffic and provides the connectivity 
paths to the TCP/IP network and storage network fabrics.
The best practices when using FCoE are as follows:
f
f
Disable the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on the switch ports connected to  
FCoE adapters
f
f
Ensure the latest microcode is installed on the FCoE network adapter
f
f
If the FCoE network adapter has multiple ports, configure each port on a  
separate vSwitch

The vSphere Storage Design

There's more...
The VMware vSphere Storage Appliance (VSA) is a software-based storage solution that 
allows the local storage across multiple ESXi hosts to be presented as a single shared NFS 
datastore. The following diagram illustrates how the VSA creates a cluster of localhost storage 
to provide shared storage to the vSphere environment.
The VSA is deployed as a virtual appliance and runs on several ESXi hosts to provide a VSA 
cluster access to the local storage resources of the host. A VSA cluster can consist of two or 
three ESXi hosts. Management of the cluster is accomplished with the VSA Manager plugin 
that is installed on a vCenter Server. The VSA is managed using the vSphere Client or vSphere 
Web Client.
Storage path selection plugins
Mutlipathing allows more than one physical path to be used to transfer data between the ESXi 
hosts and the storage array. In the event of a failure in a storage path, the host or hosts can 
switch to another available path. Multipathing also provides load balancing by distributing the 
storage I/O across multiple physical paths.

Chapter 5
91
How to do it...
To determine the multipathing policy, we perform the following steps:
1.	 Identify the different native multipathing policies available and the capabilities of 
each policy.
2.	 Select a multipathing policy based on the number of paths and the array type used.
3.	 Change the default multipathing policy using the esxcli command.
4.	 Configure the multipathing policy on the storage devices presented to the ESXi host.
How it works...
The VMware Native Multipathing Plugin (NMP) supports storage arrays listed on the VMware 
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). NMP provides path selection based on the array type by 
associating a set of physical paths with a storage device or LUN.
The Storage Array Type Plugin (SATP) monitors the available storage paths, reports changes 
in the path status, and initiates failover between paths when needed. The Path Selection 
Plugins (PSP) determine which available path to use for I/O. There are the following three 
Native Multipathing PSPs available:
f
f
Fixed: The host always uses a preferred path if the preferred path is available. If the 
preferred path fails, another available path is selected and used until the preferred 
path becomes available. This is the default policy for active/active storage devices.
f
f
Most Recently Used (MRU): The host uses the most recently used path. If the current 
path fails, another path is selected. I/O does not revert to the previous path when it 
becomes available. This is the default policy for active/passive storage devices.
f
f
Round Robin (RR): I/O is rotated through all active paths. This provides load  
balancing across all physical paths available to the hosts. This PSP can be  
used on active/passive or active/active arrays.
Array vendors may provide their own path selection plugins to provide storage multipathing. 
The use of third-party MPPs will depend on array-and-vendor best practices. The NMP can be 
used for any supported array.
The optimal PSP to choose is dependent on the recommendations of the array vendor.
By default, a PSP is set based on the SATP used for the array. The SATP to use is identified by 
the Pluggable Storage Architecture (PSA) using a set of claim rules that base the selection 
on the vendor and model of the array. The SATP then determines the default PSP to be used.

The vSphere Storage Design
92
The NMP PSP policies are as follows:
f
f
VMW_PSP_MRU: for Most Recently Used
f
f
VMW_PSP_FIXED: for Fixed
f
f
VMW_PSP_RR: for Round Robin
The default PSP for an SATP can be changed using the following esxcli command:
esxcli storage nmp satp set âdefault-psp=<psp policy to set>  
--satp=<SATP_name>
Using the command line changes the default PSP for all new devices identified by the SATP. 
The PSP for an individual device or LUN can also be changed. This can be done in the vSphere 
Client or vSphere Web Client by managing the paths for a single storage device on a host.
To change the PSP of a device using the vSphere Client, navigate to Host and Clusters | 
Hosts | Configuration | Storage Adapters, and select the storage adapter that services the 
paths you want to modify. In the Details section of the Storage Adapters window, right-click 
on the device you want to modify the PSP on and select Manage Paths.
The following screenshot displays path management in the vSphere Client:

From the Manage Paths window, select the Path Selection with the drop-down menu and 
click on Change.
The following screenshot displays how to select and change the path selection policy for a 
device using the vSphere Client:
Changing the default PSP for an SATP or the PSP for a device can be done without impacting 
normal operations. A change made to the PSP for a single device takes effect immediately. 
Changing the default PSP for the SATP changes only the settings of newly discovered devices 
and not the PSP settings of the current devices.
Sizing datastores
A datastore is a logical representation of storage presented to an ESXi host where virtual 
machine files are stored. A datastore can be a VMFS formatted volume, an NFS export,  
or a path on the local ESXi filesystem.

The vSphere Storage Design
94
How to do it...
Design requirements, virtual machine disk size, IOPS, and recovery are all factors that can 
determine the number of virtual machines to store on a single datastore. The size of the 
datastore is calculated based on the number of virtual machines per datastore and the  
size of the virtual machines.
1.	 Determine the number of virtual machines per datastore based on the capacity, 
performance, and recovery requirements.
2.	 Understand the impact the SCSI reservations may have on datastore sizing.
3.	 Understand how recovery time impacts datastore sizing.
How it works...
A design factor that was identified in Chapter 3, The Design Factors, specified that no more 
than 20 application servers should be affected by a hardware failure. Applying the same 
requirement to datastore sizing would mean that no more than 20 application servers should 
be hosted on a single datastore.
Number of VMs per datastore * (VM disk size + .vswp size) + 20% = Minimum datastore size
The datastore size for 20 application server workloads each with 100 GB of disk storage and 
8 GB of RAM with no reservations plus 20 percent for slack would be approximately 2.5 TB.
20 * (100GB + 8GB) + 20% = 2,592 GB or ~ 2.5TB
The storage backing the datastore has to provide enough IOPS to support the virtual 
machines running on it. If a virtual machine generates 50 IOPS and there are 20 virtual 
machines on the datastore, the storage must be able to support 1000 IOPS.
The maximum size of a VMFS5 datastore is 64 TB.
Block storage formatted as a VMFS volume is susceptible to SCSI reservations or locking of 
the entire LUN for a very short period of time by a single host. A few operations that cause 
SCSI reservations to occur are as follows:

With the introduction of VMFS5 along with the vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI) 
hardware-assisted locking feature, the impact of SCSI reservations is minimized. If an array 
does not support the VAAI hardware-assisted locking feature, then the number of virtual 
machines per datastore may need to be decreased to reduce the impact of LUN locking for 
SCSI reservations.
The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) must also be taken into account when determining the 
size of a datastore. If the datastore is lost or becomes inaccessible, how long will it take to 
restore the virtual machines that were running on it?
Size of Datastore / GBs recovered per hour <= RTO
If 500 GB is to be recovered per hour, the time to recover a failed datastore can be calculated 
as follows:
2.5 TB / 500GB = 5 hours to recover
If the RTO for the applications or workloads running on the datastore is less than 5 hours, the 
datastore would need to be resized to ensure recovery would take place within the defined RTO.
There's more...
Multiple datastores can be aggregated to create a datastore cluster. A datastore cluster is a 
collection of the member datastore resources with a shared management interface. vSphere 
Storage DRS manages the datastore cluster resources to determine the initial placement and 
on-going balancing of virtual machine VMDKs across the datastores in the cluster. Datastore 
clusters are supported for both VMFS and NFS datastores.
A few recommended practices when using datastore clusters and Storage DRS are as follows:
f
f
Cluster datastores with similar IOs and capacity characteristics
f
f
Use separate datastore clusters for replicated and nonreplicated datastores
f
f
Do not mix NFS and VMFS datastores in the same cluster
f
f

When a virtual machine is placed on a datastore cluster, Storage DRS determines which 
datastore in the cluster the files will be stored in, based on space utilization and/or 
performance. The following diagram is a logical representation of the virtual machines  
placed on a datastore cluster:

Introduction
To effectively design a virtual network infrastructure, a design architect must understand 
the virtual network architecture, including which features are available and how they are 
configured. This chapter contains recipes a design architect can use to design a virtual 
network architecture that provides the capacity and availability required to support the  
virtual infrastructure.

The vSphere Network Design
98
The logical network design includes calculating the network capacity or bandwidth required 
to support the virtual machines, and determining the capacity required to support VMware 
technologies such as vMotion and Fault Tolerance. If IP-based storage connectivity is required, 
the design must account for the networking necessary to support storage traffic as well.

This chapter discusses the different virtual network switch technologies available in vSphere 
and the different features available in each. This chapter also covers how load balancing and 
teaming are used to improve network utilization efficiency and increase availability. Network 
capacity resource management using traffic shaping and network I/O control are also covered.
Determining network bandwidth 
requirements
Bandwidth refers to the capacity of the network and is measured in either gigabits per 
second (Gbps) or megabits per second (Mbps). The bandwidth required is based on the 
amount of data transferred or the throughput required by the virtual machines. Most modern 
networks are capable of transferring data at 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps. Network adapters that 
support 40 Gbps have recently become available.
The number of physical network adapters in each host required to support a solution is 
dependent on the amount of bandwidth required to support virtual machine network traffic, 
the number of virtual switches required, and the network redundancy requirements.
From the case example in Chapter 3, The Design Factors, the following information is used to 
help calculate the network bandwidth requirements:
f
f
Cisco switches are used for network connectivity. Separate VLANs exist for 
management connectivity and production application connectivity.
f
f
No more than 20 application servers, or 200 customers, should be affected by 
hardware failure.
f
f
Currently, each physical server contains a single gigabit network interface card.  
Peak network usage is 10 Mbps.

Chapter 6
99
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Calculate the total amount of bandwidth required to support virtual machine network 
traffic using the following formula:
Total Number or Virtual Machines x Bandwidth per Virtual Machine (Mbps) = Total 
Bandwidth Requirement (Mbps)
2.	 Calculate the amount of bandwidth required per host. This is dependent on the 
maximum number of virtual machines that can be run on a single host.
3.	 Determine the network requirements for other vSphere services and features,  
such as vMotion, iSCSI, NFS, and Fault Tolerance.
4.	 Select the type and number of network adapters to provide the network connectivity 
required to support design requirements.
How it worksâ¦
The physical network infrastructure must be capable of supporting the total throughput 
requirement of the environment. The total throughput requirement is calculated by multiplying 
the number of virtual machines by the throughput required by a single virtual machine:
100 Virtual Machines x 10Mbps = 1000 Mbps Total
The throughput required for a single host is calculated by multiplying the number of virtual 
machines that will run on a host by the throughput required by a single virtual machine:
20 Virtual Machines x 10 Mbps = 200 Mbps per Host
Network adapters are generally capable of delivering throughput equal to approximately  
80 percent of the adapter speed, for example, 800 Mbps for a 1-Gbps network adapter.  
A single gigabit Ethernet connection would provide sufficient bandwidth to support the  
virtual machine throughput requirements calculated previously. An additional network  
adapter would be required to support failovers.
There are also network bandwidth requirements to support VMkernel interface network 
connectivity for management, vMotion, IP storage, and Fault Tolerance. The minimum 
bandwidth requirements for VMkernel network connectivity are as follows:
f
f
Management: 100 Mb
f
f
vMotion: 1 Gb
f
f
IP storage: This is dependent on the amount of storage throughput required but is 
limited to the bandwidth of a single path
f
f
Fault Tolerance: 1 Gb

The vSphere Network Design
100
Sufficient physical network connectivity and bandwidth must be included in the design to 
support these services.
Network connectivity can be provided using multiple 1 Gb network adapters, or 10GbE 
Converged Network Adapters (CNA) can be used to carry multiple network traffic types, 
including virtual machine network traffic and VMkernel (management, vMotion, FT, and IP 
storage) network traffic on a single 10GbE network adapter.
Management vmk
vMotion vmk
iSCSI vmk

Virtual Switch (vSwitch or vDSwitch)

Host1
When CNAs are used to provide physical uplink connectivity to virtual switches, traffic 
shaping or Network I/O Control (NIOC) should be configured to ensure that sufficient 
network bandwidth is available to each traffic type serviced by the CNAs.

For a virtual machine with very high network I/O requirements, DirectPath I/O allows a 
physical network adapter to be passed through directly to the virtual machine.
The following screenshot shows how a virtual machine is provided direct access to a physical 
network card using DirectPath I/O:
Portgroup VLAN 10
Standard vSwitch
DirectPath I/O
Host1

Chapter 6
101
When DirectPath I/O is used, the network adapter is only made available to the virtual 
machine it is passed to and cannot be shared with other virtual machines. The full bandwidth 
capacity of the network adapter is available to the virtual machine. Because a virtual machine 
with DirectPath I/O configured is dependent on the physical network card in the host, it 
cannot be moved to other hosts using vMotion nor can it be protected using VMware HA. The 
exception to this is when using a Cisco UCS system that has a supported Cisco UCS Virtual 
Machine Fabric Extender (VM-FEX) distributed switch.
Standard or distributed virtual switches
The connectivity of the virtual network to the physical network in a vSphere 5 environment 
is accomplished using one of two virtual switch technologies: the standard virtual switch 
(vSwitch) or the virtual distributed switch (vDSwitch). VMware technologies such as VMware 
HA, VMware DRS, and Fault Tolerance require that virtual switch configurations be consistent 
across all ESXi hosts in a cluster.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify the features and capabilities of virtual standard switches and distributed 
virtual switches.
2.	 Based on the design requirements, determine which virtual switch technology should 
be selected to support them.
How it worksâ¦
The virtual switch technology chosen is dependent on the connectivity, availability, and 
manageability requirements and the features available on the virtual switch.
A standard virtual switch (vSwitch) is configured and managed independently on each 
ESXi host and supports up to 1024 virtual switch ports per vSwitch. Because vSwitches 
are configured on each individual host, it increases the administrative overhead required 
to support large environments. Advance network features such as port mirroring, NetFlow 
integration, and private VLANs are not available when using standard virtual switches. 
vSwitches are available at all vSphere license levels.
Several networks can use the same vSwitch, or networks can be separated across multiple 
vSwitches. Multiple physical uplinks can be associated with a vSwitch to provide redundancy 
and load balancing. vSwitches can be created with no physical uplinks to keep virtual 
machine network traffic isolated on a single host.

The vSphere Network Design
102
The following screenshot depicts a common logical network design using standard virtual 
switches to provide virtual machine network connectivity:
Portgroup VLAN 11
Standard vSwitch
Host1
Portgroup VLAN 10
Portgroup VLAN 11
Standard vSwitch
Host2
Portgroup VLAN 10
Virtual distributed switches (vDSwitches) are configured and managed by vCenter. A 
vDSwitch guarantees consistent network policy configurations and PortGroup configurations 
across all hosts with uplinks that are connected to it. In vSphere 5.1, a single vDSwitch can 
support 500 ESXi hosts and provide up to 60,000 virtual switch ports. vSphere Enterprise 
Plus Licensing is required to use vDSwitches.
Multiple physical uplinks from each host can be associated with a vDSwitch to provide 
redundancy and load balancing. A vDSwitch will not be available for use by a host without  
any physical uplinks associated with it:
The following screenshot depicts a logical virtual network design using a virtual  
distributed switch:
Host1
Portgroup VLAN 11
Virtual Distributed Switch
Host3
Host2
Portgroup VLAN 10

vCenter is required to manage vDSwitches. vCenter controls the configuration state and 
keeps track of virtual machine connection information for the vDSwitch. If the vCenter Server 
managing the vDSwitch is unavailable, new connections to the vDSwitch will not be possible.

Third-party virtual switches, such as the Cisco Nexus 1000v, can be used to extend the 
functionality of a vDSwitch. They provide an interface for provisioning, monitoring, securing, 
and configuring the virtual network using standard vendor network management tools.
Providing network availability
Network availability is obtained by minimizing Single Points of Failure (SPOF) and providing 
sufficient capacity. Multiple network ports, network adapters, and physical switches can be 
used to minimize single points of failure, and link aggregation can be used to provide load 
balancing across multiple network adapters.
vSphere virtual network configurations offer multiple NIC teaming and load balancing  
options. The options used are dependent on the number of network adapters available,  
the number of virtual machines connected, the physical network's topology, and the  
amount of bandwidth required.
How to do it...
1.	 Identify the availability options available on virtual switches and virtual  
switch PortGroups.
2.	 Determine the load balancing policies to provide availability based on  
design requirements.
3.	 Determine the network adapter teaming policies to provide availability based on 
design requirements.

The vSphere Network Design
104
How it worksâ¦
Load balancing distributes the network load across multiple available adapters. Load 
balancing policies are configured as part of the NIC Teaming and failover options on  
virtual switches, virtual machine PortGroups, and VMkernel interfaces.
The following screenshot illustrates the Edit Settings dialog for configuring Teaming and 
failover options on a virtual machine PortGroup on a standard virtual switch:
The following load balancing policies can be applied to virtual switches or virtual PortGroups:
f
f
Route based on originating virtual port: This is the default load balancing policy. 
When it is being used, the load is balanced based on the number of physical  
NICs and the number of virtual switch ports in use. Virtual port connections are 
distributed across the physical NICs available to the virtual switch. A virtual machine 
connected to the virtual port will always use the same physical NIC unless the NIC 
becomes unavailable.

Chapter 6
105
f
f
Route based on IP hash: This load balancing policy uses a hashing algorithm that 
determines the physical path based on the source and destination IP addresses of the 
virtual machine traffic. A virtual machine's network traffic can use multiple available 
NICs. This policy is used when using either EtherChannel or the LACP link aggregation.
f
f
Route based on source MAC hash: This load balancing policy is similar to the Route 
based on originating virtual port policy, except that the physical NIC used for virtual 
machine traffic is based on the virtual network adapter's MAC address and not the 
virtual port connection.
f
f
Use explicit failover order: This policy is not really a load balancing policy because 
network traffic always uses the physical NIC uplink that is configured as the highest 
ordered active physical uplink available.
f
f
Route based on physical NIC load: This is an additional load balancing option 
offered by vDSwitches that is not available to vSwitches. It is the most efficient 
because it distributes the load across active uplinks based on the actual workload  
of the physical NICs.
Redundancy in the virtual network is provided by configuring Failover order. These 
configurations define the physical uplinks that are actively used to pass network traffic,  
and those that are available stand in the event of an active uplink failing.
The available adapters are as follows:
f
f
Active adapters: These are adapters that are available for use by the virtual switch, a 
virtual machine network PortGroup, or a VMkernel interface.
f
f
Standby adapters: These are adapters that become active only in the event that an 
active adapter becomes unavailable.
f
f
Unused adapters: These adapters are unused. They will never be used by the virtual 
switch, a virtual machine PortGroup, or a VMkernel interface.
The following screenshot shows adapters configured in Active and Standby. If Active Adapter 
(vmnic0) fails, the Standby Adapter (vmnic1) will become active:

commonly used in small environments to provide connectivity and redundancy for the  
host management and vMotion networks:

Active Uplink
Standby Uplink
Network Failover Detection and Failback are settings that control how a network failure is 
detected and what happens when an Active adapter is returned to service after a failure.
How network failure is detected is configured using the Network Failover Detection option. 
Two failure detection options are available: Link Status Only and Beacon Probing. The Link 
Status Only option uses the link state, up or down, of the physical NIC to determine if the 
uplink is available. The Beacon Probing option detects network failures by sending and 
receiving beacon probes out to all physical uplinks on the virtual switch and can detect link 
state and switch failures. At least three active uplinks are needed for beacon probing to work 
effectively. The VMware Knowledge Base article located at http://kb.vmware.com/
kb/1005577 provides more information on how beacon probing works with virtual switches.
The Failback setting defines whether or not an Active adapter is returned to service if the 
adapter becomes available after a failure based on the value set for Network Failover 
Detection. If a physical switch fails and Failback is enabled with Link Status Only being used 
for Failover Detection, the adapter may become active and will be returned to service before 
the physical switch is available to pass traffic.
Virtual switch security
Security is an important factor that must be considered when designing virtual networks. 
Many of the same network practices that are used in the physical network can be applied to 
the virtual network. The virtual network provides several advantages to security, but it also 
introduces some challenges.
The security of virtual machine network traffic is critical along with the security of the 
VMkernel traffic to prevent attacks that may compromise the management, vMotion,  
Fault Tolerance, and IP storage networks.

Chapter 6
107
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify the available virtual switch security options.
2.	 Select a virtual switch security configuration based on design requirements.
3.	 Apply security best practices to create a virtual network design, separating  
virtual machine services and network traffic into security zones based on  
design requirements.
How it worksâ¦
Separate the virtual machine network traffic based on services and security zones.  
Use separate vSwitches or VLAN tagging on PortGroups to separate nonproduction, DMZ, 
Test/Dev, management, vMotion, IP storage, and production virtual machine network traffic. 
The following are some things to take care of:
f
f
The vSphere management network should be separated from other network traffic 
using a management VLAN or a physically separate network.
f
f
vMotion network traffic is transmitted unencrypted. It could be possible for an 
attacker to obtain the memory contents of a virtual machine during vMotion 
migration. The recommended practice is for the vMotion network to be on a separate 
VLAN or physically separated non-routable network from other production traffic.
f
f
iSCSI and NFS IP storage traffic is also typically unencrypted. IP-based storage 
should be logically separated on its own VLAN or on a separate physical non-routable 
network segment.
The following screenshot shows the Security settings that can be applied to a virtual  
standard switch:

The vSphere Network Design
108
Virtual switch security settings are as follows:
f
f
Promiscuous mode: This policy is set to Reject by default. Setting it to Accept allows 
for guest network adapters connected to the virtual switch to detect all network 
frames passed on the virtual switch.
f
f
MAC address changes: If this policy is set to Reject and the guest operating system 
changes the MAC address to a MAC address other than what is defined in the virtual 
machine configuration file, inbound network frames are dropped.
f
f
Forged transmits: Setting this policy to Reject will drop any outbound network frame 
with a source MAC address different from the one currently set on the adapter.
Network resource management
In a vSphere environment, physical network resources are shared across multiple virtual 
machines and services. The ability to ensure that sufficient capacity is available across shared 
resources thus becomes important. If a single virtual machine or a VMkernel network service, 
such as vMotion or Fault Tolerance, saturates the available network capacity, other virtual 
machines and services, including host management services, may be adversely impacted.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify the traffic shaping and network resource controls available on the virtual 
network switches.
2.	 Determine the network resources required for different traffic types: management,  
IP storage, vMotion, and virtual machine traffic.
3.	 Design traffic shaping or Network I/O Control policies to guarantee or limit network 
resources for the network traffic types based on design requirements.
How it worksâ¦
Traffic shaping is used to limit the amount of bandwidth available to virtual switch ports. 
Network IO Control (NIOC) is used to apply limits and guarantee traffic to different virtual 
network service types.
Traffic shaping can be configured on vSwitches, vDSwitch uplinks, VMkernel interfaces, and 
PortGroups to restrict the network bandwidth available to the network ports on the virtual 
switch. Traffic shaping is applied at all times, regardless of the amount of network capacity 
available. This means that if traffic shaping is enabled and configured on a virtual switch or 
PortGroup to limit the peak bandwidth to 1,048,576 Kbps (1 Gbps), only 1,048,576 Kbps of 
bandwidth will be used even if more bandwidth is available.

Chapter 6
109
The following bandwidth characteristics can be applied to the traffic shaping policy:
f
f
Average bandwidth: This is the allowed average load measured in Kbits/sec (Kbps)
f
f
Peak bandwidth: This is the maximum allowed load measured in Kbits/sec (Kbps)
f
f
Burst size: This is the maximum number of bytes, measured in Kbytes, that can be 
burst over the specified average bandwidth
Traffic shaping policies on a vSwitch apply only to egress or outbound traffic. vDSwitch traffic 
shaping policies can be configured for both ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic.
The following is a screenshot of the configuration screen for applying Traffic shaping to a 
virtual machine PortGroup on a standard virtual switch:
The following screenshot shows the Ingress traffic shaping and Egress traffic shaping 
settings that can be applied to a virtual machine PortGroup on a vDSwitch:

The vSphere Network Design
110
Unlike traffic shaping, NIOC provides control over network bandwidth for specific network 
protocols only during times of network contention. NIOC can only be enabled on vDSwitches.
Shares, limits, and Quality of Service (QoS) can be applied to network traffic types to limit and 
guarantee bandwidth to the different network traffic types, including the following:
f
f
Management traffic
f
f
vMotion traffic
f
f
IP storage traffic (NFS/iSCSI)
f
f
Fault Tolerance traffic
f
f
vSphere replication traffic
f
f
Virtual machine traffic
The following screenshot illustrates the Network I/O Control configurations of a vDSwitch:
Limit the settings as per the host. The Mbps limit set is applied to all hosts connected to 
the vDSwitch. Physical adapter shares define the share traffic of the available bandwidth on 
a physical NIC attached to the vDSwitch; a specific traffic type is allocated during a time of 
network bandwidth contention.

Chapter 6
111
The percentage of bandwidth a traffic type receives is based on the total number of shares 
available; for example, in the default configuration, the virtual machine traffic receives  
100 shares of the 400 (50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 50 + 50) shares available. The  
formula for this is as follows:
Shares Value / Total Available Shares = Percentage of Physical Network Bandwidth
Therefore, 100 / 400 = 25%.
The amount of bandwidth available to vMotion would be calculated based on the 50 shares 
allocated to the vMotion traffic as follows:
50 / 400 = 12.5%
Using private VLANs
Private VLANs (PVLANs) are an extension of the VLAN standard. PVLANs can be configured on 
virtual distributed switches to isolate traffic between virtual machines in the same VLAN.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify the types of private VLANs available and the functionality of each.
2.	 Determine the use cases for the PVLANs and identify if the PVLANs can be used to 
satisfy design requirements.
3.	 Design the PVLANs to meet design requirements.
How it worksâ¦
A primary PVLAN is created on a vDSwitch, and secondary PVLANs are associated with the 
primary PVLAN. There are three types of secondary PVLANs: Promiscuous, Community, and 
Isolated. They are depicted in the following diagram:
PVLAN
Promisuous (120,120)
PVLAN
Community (120,120)
PVLAN
Isolated (120,120)

The vSphere Network Design
112
The virtual machine connections in a Promiscuous PVLAN can communicate with all the 
virtual machine connections in the same primary PVLAN. When a primary PVLAN is created, a 
Promiscuous PVLAN is created with the same PVLAN ID as the primary PVLAN.
Virtual machine connections in a Community PVLAN can communicate with other virtual 
machine connections in the same Community PVLAN and virtual machine connections in the 
Promiscuous PVLAN. Multiple Community PVLANs can be associated to a single primary PVLAN.
Virtual machine connections in an Isolated PVLAN can only communicate with virtual 
machine connections in the Promiscuous PVLAN. Only one Isolated PVLAN can exist per 
primary PVLAN.
Private VLANs are created by editing the settings of a vDSwitch as follows:

Chapter 6
113
Once the PVLAN has been configured on the vDSwitch, a virtual machine network PortGroup is 
created with the PVLAN type and ID assigned as follows:
There's moreâ¦
In order for PVLAN traffic to be passed between ESXi hosts connected to a vDSwitch, the 
physical switch must be PVLAN aware and properly configured to support PVLANs. The 
process to configure PVLANs on a physical switch will vary from vendor to vendor. The 
following process shows the steps necessary to configure PVLANs on a Cisco IOS switch:
1.	 Enter the Cisco switch configuration mode:
switch# configure terminal
2.	 Enable the PVLAN feature on the switch:
switch(config)# feature private-vlan
3.	 Create the PVLAN on the switch, and set the PVLAN type:
switch(config)# vlan <vlan-id> 
switch(config-vlan)# private-vlan primary
4.	 Associate the secondary PVLANs with a primary VLAN:
switch(config-vlan)# private-vlan association <secondary pvlan>
5.	 The switch ports that are connected to the vDSwitch uplinks need to be configured to 
allow the PVLAN traffic:
switch(config)# interface GigabitEthernet1/1
switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk

IP storage network design considerations
iSCSI, NFS, and Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) are IP-based storage protocols supported 
in a vSphere 5.x environment. This recipe covers the design considerations when designing 
the IP networks that will be used for storage traffic.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify the network connectivity and virtual switch configurations required for IP-
connected storage.
2.	 Determine the best practices for providing connectivity for IP-connected storage.
3.	 Design the IP storage connectivity to meet design requirements.
How it worksâ¦
IP storage traffic should be separated from other IP traffic. This separation can be provided 
by either using physically separate hardware (network adapters and physical switches) or 
separate VLANs for IP storage traffic. The networks associated with IP storage should be 
directly connected and non-routable.
Multiple network paths to storage should be configured to provide redundancy and load 
balancing. Single points of failure should be minimized so that the loss of a single network 
path does not result in the loss of storage connectivity.
Software iSCSI, NFS, and Software FCoE each require a VMkernel interface to be created 
on a virtual switch. VMkernel interfaces used for iSCSI and FCoE must be bound to a single 
physical active adapter. Having more than one active adapter or a standby adapter is not 
supported with Software iSCSI or Software FCoE.
vSphere currently supports NFS v3 over TCP, and there is no multipathing available with this 
version of NFS. Using link aggregation will only provide failover and not load balancing. NFS 
will always use a single physical network path even if multiple VMkernels are configured. To 
manually load balance NFS traffic, create separate VMkernel ports connected to separate 
networks and mount separate NFS datastores.

Chapter 6
115
The VMkernel port binding for Software iSCSI is configured in the properties of the Software 
iSCSI adapter. Only VMkernel ports that are compliant will be available for binding, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
To enable the Software FCoE adapter, an NIC that supports FCoE offloads must be installed in 
the host. If a supported NIC is not installed, the ability to add the software FCoE adapter will 
not be available.

The vSphere Network Design
116
Physical network binding for FCoE is done when enabling a Software FCoE adapter. Compliant 
and supported physical adapters are available when adding the Software FCoE adapter. 
Separate FCoE adapters should be enabled and connected to each storage network fabric. A 
single ESXi host can support up to four software FCoE adapters. Each software FCoE adapter 
requires a dedicated VMkernel port bound to a dedicated physical adapter.
There's moreâ¦
Enabling jumbo frames on the network used for vMotion, iSCSI, or NFS can increase 
performance and throughput. With jumbo frames enabled, iSCSI or NFS packets can be 
transferred over the network in a single frame; there is no fragmentation. This decreases the 
amount of CPU overhead necessary to encapsulate and de-encapsulate IP storage packets.
Jumbo frames must be supported and enabled on the network from end to end; this  
includes the physical switches as well. In vSphere, jumbo frames are enabled either in  
the vSwitch configuration or on the vDSwitch uplinks by setting the value of MTU to 9000. 
Jumbo frames must also be enabled on VMkernel interfaces by setting the value of MTU for 
the PortGroup to 9000.
Many physical switches may require a reboot after the MTU size 
has been changed. If you are using jumbo frames for this, it is a 
good idea to configure the maximum MTU on the switch during 
the initial install.
To enable jumbo frames, set the value of MTU on the vSwitch/vDSwitch uplinks to 9000 as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
117
The MTU setting must also be changed to 9000 on a VMkernel interface on the vSwitch or 
vDSwitch as follows:
To enable jumbo frames on a Cisco switch, use the following command:
Switch(config)# system mtu jumbo 9000
The switch must be reloaded for the setting to take effect. The jumbo frames configuration 
can be tested from the ESXi shell using the vmkping command with the data fragment (DF) 
bit (-d) and size (-s) options set, as shown:
ESX1 # vmkping -d -s 8972 <IP_Address_of_IP_Storage_Array>
If jumbo frames is not configured correctly, vmkping will fail.
vMotion network design considerations
vMotion allows the running state of a virtual machine to be transferred from one ESXi host to 
another. The network traffic required for the migration uses the VMkernel interfaces that have 
been enabled for vMotion. vMotion connectivity between ESXi hosts is required when using 
Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) to balance the virtual machine load across hosts in a 
DRS-enabled cluster.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Identify vMotion network requirements.
2.	 Determine the best practices for configuring the network connectivity required to 
support vMotion.
3.	 Identify the benefits of keeping virtual machines together on the same host to 
minimize the network traffic that must transverse the physical uplinks.
4.	 Design the vMotion network connectivity to support design requirements.
5.	 Design DRS rules to support design requirements.

The vSphere Network Design
118
How it worksâ¦
vMotion requires, at a minimum, a single, active 1 Gb network adapter. A second standby 
adapter should be configured to provide redundancy for the vMotion network.
A vMotion migration can consume all available network bandwidth. If the vMotion network 
is shared with other network traffic, traffic shaping or NIOC should be enabled to prevent 
vMotion from impacting other virtual network traffic. If possible, vMotion should be configured 
on a separate physical network or separate VLAN.
vSphere 5 introduced the ability to configure multiple adapters for use with vMotion.  
Multiple-NIC vMotion allows for the bandwidth of multiple physical NICs to be leveraged  
by vMotion to speed up the migration of virtual machines between hosts:
Host1
Virtual Switch
vmk - vMotion-01
Active Uplink
Standby Uplink
vmk - vMotion-02
To configure Multiple-NIC vMotion, create multiple VMkernel interfaces with vMotion  
enabled. Configure each VMkernel interface to use a single Active adapter, and configure  
other available adapters as standby adapters. When a virtual machine is vMotioned,  
either manually or by DRS, all available links will be used for the vMotion traffic. More 
information on Multiple-NIC vMotion can be found in the VMware Knowledge Base  
article at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2007467.
There's moreâ¦
Network communications between virtual machines that are connected to the same virtual 
switch on the same ESXi host will not use the physical network. All the network traffic between 
the virtual machines will remain on the host.
Keeping virtual machines that communicate with each other together on the same host 
will reduce the load on the physical network; for example, keeping a web frontend server, 
application server, and database server together on the same host will keep traffic between 
the servers internal to the host.

Chapter 6
119
If the VMware DRS is configured on a vSphere Cluster, DRS rules can be configured on the 
cluster to keep virtual machines together on the same host.
In the following screenshot, a Virtual Machine Affinity Rule has been created to keep two 
virtual machines together on the same host:
With DRS enabled, the virtual machines assigned to the DRS rule will be vMotioned to run on 
the same host.
Virtual machine anti-affinity rules (Separate Virtual Machines) can also be configured 
to ensure that virtual machines run on separate hosts. This can be used when service 
redundancy is provided by multiple virtual machines, such as with multiple virtual domain 
controllers. Keeping virtual machines separate will ensure that a host failure does not impact 
service redundancy.

Introduction
This chapter covers logical compute design. Compute refers to the processor and memory 
resources required to support the virtual machines running in the vSphere environment. 
Calculating the required CPU and memory resources is an important part of the design 
process and ensures that the environment will be able to support the virtual machine 
workloads. Design decisions such as scaling up, scaling out, and clustering hosts are covered.

The vSphere Compute Design
122
In a physical environment where a single operating system or a single application is installed 
on a dedicated physical hardware, compute utilization usually averages 10 to 20 percent of 
the available resources. A majority of the memory and CPU resources are idle and wasted. In 
a virtual environment, the resources available are utilized by multiple operating systems and 
applications. It is not uncommon to see a usage of 65 to 80 percent of the available resources.

This chapter takes a look at the clustering hosts' resources in order to take advantage of 
the advanced VMware features: VMware High Availability (HA) and VMware Distributed 
Resource Scheduler (DRS). Reserving resources for failover and providing vMotion 
compatibility are also covered.
Calculating CPU resource requirements
There are several factors that must be considered when calculating CPU resources 
requirements, such as the amount of CPU resources required to support the current 
workloads, the amount of CPU resources required to support future growth, and the  
maximum CPU utilization threshold.
The following discovery information from Chapter 3, The Design Factors, will be used to 
calculate the CPU requirements:
f
f
Currently, there are 100 physical servers, each hosting a single application. Each 
application services 10 customers.
f
f
The business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year.
f
f
Support growth over the next five years.
f
f
Each application server is configured with two dual-core 2.7 GHz processors. The 
peak usage of a single application server is approximately 10 percent of the total or 
approximately 1 GHz.

Chapter 7
123
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Determine the amount of CPU resources required to support the current workloads:
Number of Workloads x CPU Speed in MHz or GHz = Current CPU Resources Required
2.	 Determine the maximum utilization threshold. This is the maximum percentage of 
available resources that should be consumed.
3.	 Determine the amount of growth in CPU resources that the environment  
should support.
4.	 Calculate the amount of CPU resources required:
Current Workload CPU Resources + Future Growth + Maximum Utilization Threshold 
= Total CPU Resources Required
How it worksâ¦
Calculating the required CPU resources necessary to support the current workloads is 
straightforward using the following formula:
Number of Workloads x CPU Speed in MHz or GHz = Current CPU Resources Required
100 x 1 GHz = 100 GHz
In order to determine the total CPU resources required, the amount required to support  
future growth must also be calculated. The amount of CPU resources required for future 
growth will be determined by the design requirements. Based on the requirements identified 
in Chapter 3, The Design Factors, the environment should be designed to support a growth of 
25 additional virtual machines over the next five years.
A maximum utilization threshold must also be determined and accounted for in CPU 
resource requirements. This threshold determines the maximum percentage of total CPU 
resources that will be consumed. It is unlikely that the environment would be configured to 
consume 100 percent of the CPU resources available. If the maximum utilization threshold 
is 75 percent, an additional 25 percent of CPU resources will be added to calculate the total 
CPU resources required:
Current CPU Resources Required + Future Growth = Total CPU Resources Required
100 GHz + (25 x 1 GHz) = 125 GHz
When the maximum utilization threshold is 75%, the calculation will be as follows:
125 GHz * (100/75) = ~167 GHz

The vSphere Compute Design
124
The environment must be designed to support the 167 GHz of CPU resources that are in turn 
required to support the current workloads, future workloads, and provide for a maximum 
utilization threshold of 75 percent.
Calculating memory resource requirements
There are several factors that must be considered when calculating memory requirements; 
these factors include the amount of memory required to support the current workloads, the 
amount of memory required to support future growth, the amount of memory required for 
virtual machine memory overhead, and the maximum memory utilization threshold.
As with CPU requirements, the discovery information from Chapter 3, The Design Factors, will 
also be used to calculate the memory requirements:
f

Currently, there are 100 physical servers, each hosting a single application. Each 
application services 10 customers.

f
The business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year.
f

f
f
Each application server is configured with 8 GB of memory. The peak usage of a 
single application server is approximately 65 percent or around 5.2 GB.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Determine the amount of memory resources required to support the current workloads:
Number of Workloads X Memory Usage = Current Memory Required
2.	 Determine the memory overhead required.
3.	 Determine the maximum utilization threshold. This is the maximum percentage of 
available resources that should be consumed.
4.	 Determine the amount of growth in the memory resources that the environment 
should support.
5.	 Determine any memory resource savings that may be realized from memory sharing 
(for example, Transparent Page Sharing (TPS)).
6.	 Calculate the amount of memory resources required:
Current Workload Memory Usage + Memory Overhead + Future Growth + Maximum 
Utilization Threshold - TPS Savings = Total Memory Resources Required

Chapter 7
125
How it worksâ¦
To calculate the amount of memory required to support the current workloads, the following 
formula is used:
Number of Workloads x Memory Usage = Current Memory Required
100 x 5.2 GB = 520 GB
The memory overhead of a virtual machine must also be accounted for when calculating 
memory requirements. The amount of memory required for an overhead depends on the 
configuration of the virtual machine. The number of vCPUs allocated to the virtual machine, 
the amount of memory allocated to the virtual machine, and the virtual hardware configured 
for the virtual machine will have an impact on the amount of memory required for overhead:
Typically, the memory overhead required for a virtual machine is between 20 MB and 150 MB. 
Memory overhead estimations based on the amount of RAM and the number of vCPUs can 
be found in the vSphere 5.1 documentation at http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/
index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc%2FGUID-B42C72C1-
F8D5-40DC-93D1-FB31849B1114.html and for vSphere 5.5 at http://pubs.
vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.
doc%2FGUID-B42C72C1-F8D5-40DC-93D1-FB31849B1114.html.
This may seem like a small amount of memory, but over dozens or even hundreds of virtual 
machines, it can have a significant impact on the amount of total memory required:
(Number of Workloads x Memory Usage) + (Number of Workloads x Memory Overhead) = 
Current Memory Required
(100 x 5.2 GB) + (100 x 50 MB) = 525 GB
To calculate the total memory required, future growth must be considered. When memory 
is calculated for growth, the memory overhead required to support the additional virtual 
machines must also considered.

The vSphere Compute Design
126
The maximum utilization threshold must also be determined for memory resources.  
This threshold defines what is the maximum percentage of the total memory resources  
that will be consumed. If the maximum utilization threshold is 75 percent, an additional  
25 percent of memory resources will need to be added in order to calculate the total  
memory resources required:
Current Memory Required + Future Growth * (100/Maximum Threshold%) = Total Memory 
Resources Required
525 GB + [(25 x 5.2 GB) + (25 x 50 MB)] * (100/75) = ~875 GB
875 GB of memory is required to support the current workloads, future growth, and a 
maximum utilization threshold of 75 percent.
There's moreâ¦
Transparent Page Sharing (TPS) is a memory sharing mechanism used by ESXi that allows 
virtual machine memory content that is same to be shared between the virtual machines on 
the same host by eliminating the redundant copies of memory pages.
The amount of memory saved by memory sharing depends on workload characteristics. Many 
nearly identical virtual machines may provide substantial resource savings due to memory 
sharing, while a more diverse workload will result in little, if any, gains from TPS.
When virtual machine workloads are similar, running the same guest operating system and 
the same or similar applications, a percentage of the memory used by the virtual machines 
will be the same:
Total Memory Resources Required â Percentage of TPS Savings = Total Memory Resources 
Required
875 GB â 25% = ~657 GB
If savings associated with TPS are applied, the total amount of memory required is 
approximately 657 GB. If the design required that the memory should not be overcommitted 
or reserved for each virtual machine, any potential savings for TPS should not be applied.
In order to take advantage of TPS, large memory pages would need to be disabled on the  
ESXi hosts. This is done by setting Mem.AllocGuestLargePage to 0. This configuration 
must be done on each host. Disabling large pages will increase sharing and decrease the 
amount of physical memory required, but it can have a performance impact, especially with 
memory-intensive workloads.

Chapter 7
127
Scaling up or scaling out
Once the total CPU and memory resource requirements have been calculated, the amount 
of resources per host must be determined. Host resources can be designed based on two 
resource-scaling methodologies, scaling up or scaling out.
When scaling up, fewer, larger hosts are used to satisfy the resource requirements. More 
virtual machines run on a single host; because of this, more virtual machines are also 
affected by a host failure.
When scaling out, many smaller hosts are used to satisfy the resource requirements.  
Fewer virtual machines run on a single host, and fewer virtual machines will be affected  
by a host failure.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Determine whether the host in the environment should scale up or scale out.
2.	 Determine the number of virtual machine workloads per host.
3.	 Based on the number of virtual machines per host, calculate the number of hosts 
required. This should also include the number of hosts required to support growth 
and failover:
(Number of Workloads / Number of Workloads per Host) + (Number of Future 
Workloads / Number of Workloads per Host) + Number of Failover Hosts = Number of 
Physical Hosts Required
4.	 Using the identified CPU requirements, calculate the CPU resources required  
per host:
Total CPU Resources Required / (Number of Physical Hosts Required - Failover Hosts) 
= CPU Resources per Host
5.	 Using the identified memory requirements, calculate the memory resources required 
per host:
Total Memory Resources Required / (Number of Physical Hosts Required - Failover 
Hosts) = Memory Resources per Host
How it worksâ¦
Many CPU and memory resources were calculated in the earlier recipes in this chapter and 
are stated as follows:
f
f
The total number of CPU resources required is 167 GHz
f
f
The total number of memory resources required, taking into account a 25 percent 
savings for Transparent Page Sharing, is 657 GB

The vSphere Compute Design
128
Based on the design factors, the determination can be made on whether a host should be 
designed to scale up or scale out. In this case, the following design information provides what 
is needed to size the individual host resources:
f
f
Currently, there are 100 physical servers, each hosting a single application. Each 
application services 10 customers.
f
f
No more than 20 application servers or 200 customers should be affected by a 
hardware failure.
f
f
The business expects to add 50 new customers over the next year.
f
f
Support growth over the next five years.
Based on the requirements, the total number of hosts required to support the current 
workloads, the future workloads, and the redundancy requirements can be calculated:
Total Hosts Required = (100 physical servers / 20 virtual servers per host) + [((50 new 
customers x 5 years) / 10) / 20] + 2 failover hosts = 8.25 = 9 Physical Hosts Required
Use the following to determine the number of CPU resources required per host (the failover 
hosts are not included here because these resources are effectively reserved for failover):
167 GHz / 7 = 23.8 GHz CPU per Host
Use the following to determine the number of memory resources required per host (as with 
CPU resources, the failover hosts are not included in the calculation):
657 GB / 7 = ~94 GB Memory per Host
Each physical host will need to be sized to support 20 virtual machines and will require  
23.8 GHz of CPU resources and 94 GB of memory resources.
There's moreâ¦
The requirements from Chapter 3, The Design Factors, are very specific about the  
maximum number of virtual machines that can be run on a host. This simplifies the scale-up 
or scale-out design decision. The following are a couple of other possible design requirements 
to work through in order to demonstrate the impact that scaling up and scaling out will have 
on resources.
f
f
What if a requirement was to virtualize the environment using three hosts? What 
resources would be required for each host? If there are 100 virtual machines, how 
many will be impacted during a host hardware failure?
f
f
What if the requirement was that each host should be configured with resources 
to support no more than 10 virtual machines? How will that change the number of 
resources required for each host? If there are 100 virtual machines, how many will  
be impacted during a host hardware failure?

Chapter 7
129
Determining the vCPU-to-core ratio
The number of virtual machine vCPUs allocated compared to the number of physical CPU 
cores available is the vCPU-to-core ratio. Determining this ratio will depend on the CPU 
utilization of the workloads.
If workloads are CPU-intensive, the vCPU-to-core ratio will need to be smaller; if workloads are 
not CPU-intensive, the vCPU-to-core ratio can be larger. A typical vCPU-to-core ratio for server 
workloads is about 4:1âfour vCPUs allocated for each available physical core. However, this 
can be much higher if workloads are not CPU-intensive.
A vCPU-to-core ratio that is too large can result in high CPU Ready timesâthe percentage  
of time that a virtual machine is ready but is unable to be scheduled to run on the physical 
CPUâwhich will have a negative impact on the virtual machine's performance.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Determine the number of vCPUs required:
vCPUs per Workload x Number of Workloads Per Host = Number of vCPUs Required
2.	 Determine the vCPU-to-core ratio based on the CPU utilization of the workloads. If 
the workloads are CPU-intensive, the vCPU-to-CPU-core ratio will be lower; for less 
CPU-intensive workloads, the ratio will be higher. The ratio of 4:1 is generally a good 
starting point for server workloads.
3.	 Calculate the number of CPU cores required to support the vCPU-to-CPU-core ratio:
Number of vCPUs x vCPU-to-core ratio = Number of Cores Required
How it worksâ¦
The vCPU-to-core ratio is calculated based on the number of vCPUs allocated and the number of 
physical CPU cores available. For example, if two vCPUs are allocated to each virtual machine:
2 vCPUs allocated to each virtual machine x 20 virtual machines = 40 vCPUs
In a design with 40 vCPUs that requires a 4:1 vCPU-to-core ratio, a minimum of 10 physical 
cores would be required.
If dual 8-core processors are used, the vCPU-to-core ratio can be calculated as follows:
2 x 8 Cores = 16 Total Cores
40 vCPUs and physical 16 Cores = 2.5 vCPUs to each physical core, or a 2.5:1  
vCPU-to-core Ratio

The vSphere Compute Design
130
Clustering compute resources
A vSphere cluster is a group of ESXi hosts. The CPU, memory, storage, and network resources of 
each host are combined to form a logical set of cluster resources. A vSphere cluster is required 
to facilitate the use of features such as vSphere HA, vSphere DRS, and Fault Tolerance.
A single vSphere 5.x cluster can contain up to 32 hosts. For vSphere features such as vSphere 
HA and DRS to work correctly, the configurations must be consistent across all hosts in the 
cluster. The consistency of shared storage and network configurations is a necessity.
How to do it...
1.	 Using the vSphere Web Client of vSphere Client, create a new vSphere cluster.
2.	 Enable vSphere High Availability on the cluster.
3.	 Enable vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduling on the cluster.
How it worksâ¦
A new cluster is created using either the vSphere Web Client or vSphere Client. Right-click on 
the datacenter object in which you want the cluster to be created and select New Cluster. The 
New Cluster dialog will open as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
131
A name must be provided for the cluster. Other cluster options, such as enabling DRS and 
vSphere HA can be configured during the new cluster creation or can be configured at a later 
time by editing the properties of the cluster.
Once the cluster has been created, hosts can be added to the cluster. New hosts are added to 
the cluster using the Add Host wizard by right-clicking on the cluster and selecting Add Host. 
Existing hosts can be added to the cluster by dragging-and-dropping the host inventory object 
into the new cluster. The cluster's Summary tab displays the available cluster resources, the 
cluster resource usage, and details of vSphere DRS and vSphere HA configurations.
Hosts within a cluster should be configured with similar compute resources. In a cluster where 
the VMware DRS is enabled, processor compatibility is required. Checking for processor 
compatibility is covered later in this chapter.

The vSphere Compute Design
132
Reserving HA resources to support failover
When vSphere High Availability (HA) has been enabled on a vSphere cluster, the virtual 
machines running on the cluster are protected from a host hardware failure or virtual  
machine guest operating system crash.
In the event that a host suffers a hardware failure or if ESXi crashes, the virtual machines are 
restarted on the surviving hosts in the cluster. Resources must be reserved in the cluster to 
guarantee that the necessary resources are available to restart the virtual machines.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Edit the settings of the vSphere cluster to enable High Availability.
2.	 Enable the HA Admission Control policy.
3.	 Select the HA Admission Control policy that should be applied to the cluster.
4.	 Define the failover settings required based on the HA Admission Control policy selected.
How it worksâ¦
VMware HA Admission Control ensures that enough physical resources are available to meet 
the CPU and memory reservation requirements needed to restart the virtual machines on 
surviving hosts, in case there is a host failure:
When HA Admission Control is enabled, virtual machines cannot be powered on if there are 
insufficient resources to meet the reservation requirements for the virtual machines protected 
in the HA cluster. The resource requirements are calculated based on the HA Admission 
Control policy selected.

Chapter 7
133
In vSphere 5.x, there are three HA admission control policies:
f
f
Define failover capacity by static number of hosts
f
f
Define failover capacity by reserving a percentage of the cluster resources
f
f
Use dedicated failover hosts
The Define failover capacity by static number of hosts policy (for vSphere client: Host 
failures cluster tolerates) reserves failover resources based on the slot size. The slot size 
is determined by the largest CPU and memory reservation for a virtual machine that has 
been powered on. The number of slots available in the cluster and the number of slots to be 
reserved based on the failover capacity selection are calculated by HA.
A single virtual machine with a large memory or CPU reservation will have an impact on the 
number of slots available. The value of Fixed slot size configured using the vSphere Web 
Client defines the amount of CPU and memory resources that make up a slot. In the versions 
of vSphere prior to 5.1, the slot size could be configured with the vSphere Client by setting the 
HA advanced options as das.slotCPUInMHz for CPU resources and as das.slotMeminMB 
for memory resources.
Using the Define failover capacity by reserving a percentage of the cluster resources policy 
(for vSphere Client: Percentage of cluster resources reserved as failover spare capacity) 
allows a percentage of the memory and CPU resources to be reserved to accommodate a  
host failure. This reservation is distributed across all hosts in the cluster. To guarantee 
resource availability in the event of a host failure, the percentage should be set to reserve 
the CPU and memory resources equal to a single host in a cluster; for example, for a 5-host 
cluster, 20 percent of cluster resources should be reserved. This will guarantee that enough 
resources are available to support a single host failure.
The Use dedicated failover hosts policy (for vSphere Client: Specify failover hosts) reserves 
a configured host to be available for failover. The hosts specified as failover hosts will not 
provide resources to virtual machines during normal operations. The host is a hot spare and 
virtual machines will only be started on the hosts.
If HA Admission Control is disabled, virtual machines can be powered on even if there are 
not enough resources available to ensure failover capacity. If surviving hosts are not able 
to provide the resources with reservations necessary to start virtual machines, the virtual 
machines will not be restarted when a host fails.

The vSphere Compute Design
134
Using distributed resource scheduling to 
balance cluster resources
The vSphere DRS determines the initial placement and balances resources across available 
host resources in a vSphere cluster. Virtual machine resources can be guaranteed or limited. 
Rules can be applied to keep virtual machines together on the same host or to ensure that 
virtual machines run on separate hosts.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Edit the settings of the vSphere cluster to enable vSphere DRS.
2.	 Select a value for the DRS Automation Level that should be applied to the  
DRS-enabled cluster.
3.	 Select a value for Migration Threshold that should be applied to the  
DRS-enabled cluster.
How it worksâ¦
vSphere DRS can be enabled when creating a new vSphere cluster or by editing the settings 
of an existing cluster:

Chapter 7
135
When DRS is enabled, the DRS Automation Level and Migration Threshold is set to 
determine how DRS will place and migrate virtual machines between hosts in the cluster in 
order to balance the resources across all hosts in the cluster.
If Automation Level is set to Manual, vCenter will make suggestions for initial virtual machine 
placement and virtual machine migrations. When a virtual machine is powered on, DRS 
makes a suggestion for the initial placement of the virtual machine based on the balance of 
cluster resources,  but this must be acknowledged by or can be changed by the administrator. 
Migrations will not be performed unless they are acknowledged by an administrator.
Setting Automation Level to Partially Automated will make vCenter automatically  
select a cluster host to place the virtual machine at power-on, but it will only make 
recommendations for virtual machine migrations. Migrations are not performed  
unless acknowledged by an administrator.
When Automation Level is set to Fully Automated, it allows vCenter to automatically 
determine the initial placement of virtual machines. This setting also causes vCenter to 
automatically migrate virtual machines between the hosts in the cluster in order to balance 
resource usage across all cluster hosts. When Automation Level is set to Fully Automated, 
virtual machines will also be automatically migrated to other hosts in the cluster when a host 
is placed in the maintenance mode.
The default DRS migration threshold will typically provide the best 
balance for most clusters. If cluster resources are not balanced or if too 
many DRS migrations are being invoked, the migration threshold can be 
adjusted to be either more conservative or more aggressive.
Migration Threshold determines how the cluster will be balanced when Automation Level is 
set to Fully Automated or how DRS recommendations will be generated when Automation 
Level is set to Manual or Partially Automated.
A conservative migration threshold setting will only cause virtual machines to migrate if the 
migration will result in a significant improvement in the balance of resources. Setting the 
migration threshold to be more aggressive will cause virtual machines to migrate if any benefit 
can be realized from the migration. Setting the migration threshold to be too aggressive can 
result in unnecessary virtual machine migrations or virtual machines constantly migrating in 
an attempt to aggressively balance the resources.

Ensuring cluster vMotion compatibility
vMotion provides for running virtual machines to be migrated between vSphere hosts. In order 
to facilitate live vMotion, the processors between hosts must contain the same CPU features 
and present the same instruction sets. Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) masks 
compatibility issues between the hosts in a cluster.
Enabling EVC on a cluster ensures that hosts added to the cluster 
in the future will not have vMotion compatibility issues.
Processors must be from the same manufacturer; EVC does not provide vMotion  
compatibility between Intel and AMD processors. EVC is not required to support HA  
across different processor types and only support live vMotion between hosts.
How to do itâ¦
1.	 Edit the settings of the vSphere cluster.
2.	 Change the value of EVC Mode to Enable EVC and select an EVC mode baseline.
How it worksâ¦
The EVC mode is enabled on the cluster when the cluster is created or by editing the 
Properties of the cluster. The EVC baseline is selected based on the processor manufacturer 
(EVC for AMD hosts or EVC for Intel hosts). The selected baseline compatibility is validated 
against all hosts in the cluster.
The following screenshot shows the EVC mode enabled for Intel hosts and the mode set to 
Intel "Sandy Bridge" Generation:

The EVC baseline configuration and the processor supported for each EVC baseline can be

During the physical design process, the hardware and configuration choices should map to 
the logical design and satisfy the functional and nonfunctional design requirements.
A design architect should answer the following questions about each design decision:
f
f
Does the design meet the requirements of the logical design?
f
f
Does the design satisfy the functional and nonfunctional requirements?
f
f
Is the selected hardware supported?
There will often be more than one physical solution that will meet the design requirements.
This chapter contains recipes for verifying whether or not our hardware is supported by 
checking VMware's Hardware Compatibility List, the physical design of storage, network,  
and compute resources, creating a custom ESXi image, and best practices for BIOS settings 
on a server running ESXi.
Using the VMware Hardware Compatibility 
List (HCL)
VMware's Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) is a database of all tested and supported 
physical hardware. The physical hardware chosen to support the created design must be 
checked against the HCL to ensure that it will be supported. This includes storage devices,  
I/O devices, and servers. It is important to ensure not only that the hardware vendor and 
model is supported, but also the firmware version of the hardware.
Verifying supportability against the HCL is important not only for new designs, but also  
when upgrading a design from one version to another on vSphere. Legacy hardware is  
often removed from the HCL when new versions of vSphere are released.
How to do itâ¦
To verify whether or not a certain hardware device is supported with the current version of 
vSphere, perform the following process:
1.	 Visit http://www.vmware.com/go/hcl/.
2.	 Select the type or category of device to determine its compatibility by selecting it 
using the What are you looking for dropdown. For example, if the compatibility of a 
Network Interface Card (NIC) is being determined, select IO Devices, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 8
141
3.	 Select values for Product Release Version, Brand Name, and IO Device Type, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

The vSphere Physical Design
142
4.	 Enter a value for Keyword, such as the model number. In this example, the search 
will be for NC364T, which is an HP quad port 1 Gb server adapter, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5.	 Clicking on the device model will display details about the device, the firmware 
versions that are supported, and the device driver used by ESXi, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 8
143
How it worksâ¦
The VMware HCL provides an easy-to-search online database of hardware that has been 
tested and is supported in a vSphere environment.
Hardware that is not listed on VMware's Hardware Compatibility List 
may still work with vSphere. However, if the hardware is not listed on 
the HCL, it may cause issues with obtaining support from VMware in 
the event of issues with the environment. Only hardware found on the 
HCL should be used in vSphere production environments.
Selecting the hardware type, VMware product and version, hardware vendor, device type, and 
supported features allows a design architect to quickly view and select supported hardware. 
Details about the supported firmware or BIOS versions, the availability of native drivers, and 
the requirement for third-party drivers can also be quickly viewed for hardware information on 
the HCL.
There's moreâ¦
VMware also provides compatibility guides. The compatibility guides can be accessed through 
a menu on the HCL page located at http://www.vmware.com/go/hcl. These guides 
provide details about the features supported by a specific piece of support hardware and can 
be seen in the following screenshot:

The vSphere Physical Design
144
The following screenshot is an excerpt from the Storage/SAN Compatibility Guide showing the 
support details of the EMC VNX5300 array:
Another important guide to reference is VMware's Product Interoperability Matrix, located 
at http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/sim/interop_matrix.php. 
This guide provides interoperability information about vSphere products, databases, and 
host operating systems. If multiple VMware products will be used in the storage design, 
their interoperability must be checked against the matrix to determine which versions are 
compatible with which products.
For example, if the VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is going to be used in a vSphere 
5.1 design, the interoperability matrix is checked to determine which versions of SRM are 
compatible with that version of vSphere:
The VMware compatibility guides are also available from the Product Interoperability 
Matrixes page.

Understanding the physical storage design
Storage is the foundation of any vSphere design. Properly designed storage is key for vSphere 
features, such as High Availability (HA), Distributed Resource Scheduling (DRS), and Fault 
Tolerance (FT), to operate correctly.
How to do itâ¦
Performance, capacity, availability, and recoverability are all factors that must be taken into 
account when determining the hardware and the configuration of the physical storage. The 
physical storage design requires the following steps:
1.	 Select a storage hardware that satisfies the logical storage design. This includes 
the storage array, storage host bus adapters, and any switching, fiber channel, or 
Ethernet that may be required to support storage connectivity.
2.	 Verify the compatibility of each storage hardware component using the VMware HCL.
3.	 Design the storage configuration to satisfy the design factors related to availability, 
recoverability, performance, and capacity.
How it worksâ¦
The physical storage design must meet the capacity and performance requirements  
defined by the logical storage design, and these requirements must be mapped back  
to the design factors.
The logical storage design identifies the capacity, IOPS, and throughput required to support 
the vSphere design. The design factors identify the functional requirements, such as 
availability and recoverability, and any constraints that may be placed on the physical design, 
such as using an array from a specific vendor or using a specific storage protocol.
The logical storage design specifications are as follows:
f
f
Storage capacity: 16 TB
f
f
Storage IOPS: 6250
f
f
I/O profile: 8k
f
f
I/O size: 90% Read / 10% Write

Total storage throughput: 55 MB/s

The factors that influence the physical storage design include the following:
f
f
Shared or local storage
f
f
Block storage or file storage
f
f
Array specifications, such as active/active or active/passive; the number of storage 
processors; and cache
f
f

(FCoE) as well as the type and number of disks and the RAID configuration
f
f
Support for VMware integration: vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI) and 
vSphere APIs for Storage Awareness (VASA)
f
f
Support for advanced storage technologies: de-duplication, tiering, and  
flash-based cache
f
f
Recovery Point Objective (RPO), which is the amount of data that will not be lost in 
the event of a disaster and the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), which is the amount 
of time it takes to recover the system and data in the event of a disaster
The chief considerations when choosing a storage platform are IOPS, throughput, and support 
for features such as VAAI, VASA, SRM and accelerated backups. Physical storage design 
should focus on both performance and capacity. The physical storage design must be able to 
meet the performance requirements of the design.
Meeting the design capacity requirements is typically easy to accomplish, but ensuring that 
the storage will meet the performance requirements takes a bit more work. The I/O profile of 
the workloads, number of IOPS required, types of disks used, and RAID level selected all have 
an impact on the storage performance. It is good practice to first design the storage to meet 
the performance requirements and then design to meet the capacity requirements.
Understanding the physical network design
Network connectivity must be provided for both virtual machine network connectivity and 
VMkernel connectivity. Physical switches, uplinks, virtual switches, and virtual PortGroups  
are all components of the physical network design.
How to do itâ¦
Performance, capacity, availability, and recoverability are all factors that must be taken into 
account when determining the hardware and the configuration of the physical network. The 
following steps are necessary to successfully complete the physical network design:
1.	 Select the network hardware that satisfies the logical network design, including 
physical network switches and network interface cards.

Chapter 8
147
2.	 Verify whether or not the network I/O device hardware, such as network interface 
cards and converged network adapters (CNA), is compatible and supported using 
the VMware HCL.
3.	 Design the physical network topology and virtual network configuration to satisfy the 
design factors related to availability, recoverability, performance, and capacity.
How it worksâ¦
The physical network design must satisfy the performance and availability requirements 
defined by the logical network design, which in turn must support the design factors. The 
logical network design identifies the capacity requirements and the design factors define the 
availability and recoverability requirements.
Besides providing virtual machine connectivity, many vSphere features, such as High 
Availability, vMotion, and Fault Tolerance, have specific virtual and physical network 
connectivity requirements that must be taken into account when designing the physical 
network. If IP-connected storage, iSCSI, or NFS is used, physical network connectivity for  
these must also be included as part of the physical network design.
The logical network design specifications are as follows:
f
f
Total virtual machine throughput: 1000 Mbps
f
f
Virtual machines per host: 20
f
f
Virtual-machine throughput per host: 200 Mbps
f
f
IP storage: iSCSI
f
f
Storage throughput: 55 MB/s

In the following diagram of an example virtual- and physical-network design, the VLANs and 
virtual standard switches have been configured to distinguish traffic types; single points of 
failure have been minimized using multiple uplinks and failover policies have been configured 
to provide redundancy and performance:
Creating the physical compute design
The physical compute design selects the CPU and memory resources to meet the 
requirements of the design. Besides the CPU and memory resources, the physical  
compute design also includes selecting the form factor to support the interface cards 
necessary to support the design.

Chapter 8
149
How to do itâ¦
As with other parts of the physical design, the performance, capacity, availability, and 
recoverability are all factors to consider in the physical compute design. The following  
steps can be performed to create the physical compute design:
1.	 Select server hardware that satisfies the logical compute design.
2.	 Verify the compatibility of each component of the compute hardware using the 
VMware HCL.
3.	 Configure compute resources to satisfy the design factors related to availability, 
recoverability, performance, and capacity.
How it worksâ¦
The logical compute design defines the capacity and performance requirements for CPU and 
memory resources.
The logical compute design specifications are as follows:
f
f
Total CPU resources: 167 GHz
f
f
Total memory resources (25% TPS savings): 657 GB
f
f
Number of virtual machines per host: 20
f
f
Number of hosts required (N+2): 9
f
f
CPU resources per host: 23.8 GHz
f
f
Memory resources per host: 94 GB
The hardware selected for the physical compute design must satisfy the resource 
requirements of the logical compute design. These resources include the CPU and memory 
resources. The physical hardware selected must also be able to support the network and 
storage connectivity resources defined in the logical network and storage design.
Along with the design requirements and constraints, the factors that influence the physical 
compute design include the following:
f
f
The required CPU resources

An example of a physical design using HP DL380 rack servers is shown in the  
following diagram:

Each rack server has its own connectivity. The following diagram shows how a rack server is 
connected to the network:
Another example of a physical design is using blade servers. This increases server density, 
while simplifying connectivity.
The following diagram is an example of a physical compute design using the Cisco UCS blade 
platform; the blades have been configured to support the logical requirements and multiple 
chassis have been chosen to eliminate single points of failure:

Creating a custom ESXi image
Drivers for some supported hardware devices are not included as part of the base ESXi image. 
These devices require a driver be installed before the hardware can be used in vSphere.
How to do itâ¦
Third-party drivers are packaged as vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs). A VIB file is similar 
to a ZIP archive in that it is a single file that includes an archive of the driver files, an XML 
descriptor file, and a signature file. VIB files have the .vib file extension.
The required drives can be installed after ESXi has been installed, using the esxcli command:
esxcli software vib install -v <path to vib package>
A custom ESXi image can also be created using the Image Builder tools included with 
PowerCLI. PowerCLI can be downloaded from https://www.vmware.com/support/
developer/PowerCLI/. Custom ESXi images can be used when deploying hosts using 
VMware Auto Deploy or custom images can be exported to an ISO to be used for installation or 
upgrades. Perform the following steps to create a custom EXSi image:
1.	 Download ESXi Offline Bundle from the My VMware portal. The following screenshot 
displays the ESXi Offline Bundle download link on the My VMware portal:

Chapter 8
153
2.	 Download the required third-party VIBs. This example uses the drivers of QLogic  
FC-FCoE downloaded from the My VMware portal, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Use Image Builder PowerCLI to add the ESXi Offline Bundle and third-party VIBs as 
software depots, as follows:
Add-EsxSoftwareDepot <pathtoESXiOfflineBundel.zip>
Add-EsxSoftwareDepot <pathto3rdPartyVIB.zip>
4.	 The following screenshot illustrates adding the Offline ESXi Bundle and  
third-party software bundles using the Add-EsxSoftwareDepot Image  
Builder PowerCLI command:

The vSphere Physical Design
154
5.	 List the available software packages to locate the Qlogic drivers and note the  
package names:
Get-EsxSoftwarePackage | where {$_.Vendor -eq "Qlogic"}
The following screenshot illustrates the use of the Get-EsxSoftwarePackage 
PowerCLI command to locate the package name of the third-party package that  
will be added to the new ESXi image:
6.	 List the available image profiles, using the following command:
Get-EsxImageProfile
The following screenshot illustrates the output of the Get-EsxImageProfile 
PowerCLI command that lists the available profiles:
7.	
Create a clone of an image profile to apply customizations to. The clone will allow the 
profile to be manipulated without making changes to the original profile:
New-EsxImageProfile -CloneProfile <ProfiletoClone> -Name 
<CustomProfileName> -Vendor Custom -AcceptanceLevel 
PartnerSupported

Chapter 8
155
The following screenshot illustrates the output of the New-EsxImageProfile 
PowerCLI command that creates a clone of an existing profile:
8.	 Add the software packages to the cloned image profile; this step is repeated for each 
package to be added to the new image profile:
Add-EsxSoftwarePackage -ImageProfile <CustomProfileName> 
-SoftwarePackage <SoftwarePackagetoAdd>
The following screenshot displays the output of the Add-EsxSoftwarePackage 
PowerCLI command when the third-party software package is added to the new  
ESXi image:
9.	 Create an ISO from the cloned image profile using the following command; the ISO 
will include the additional software packages:
Export-EsxImageProfile -ImageProfile <CustomProfileName> 
-ExportToIso -filepath <Pathtonew.iso>

The vSphere Physical Design
156
The following screenshot shows the Export-EsxImageProfile PowerCLI 
command. There will be no message output from the command if it completes 
successfully, but the ESXi image ISO will be created and made available in the 
provided path:
The new ISO image includes the third-party VIBs and can be used to install ESXi.
How it worksâ¦
The Image Builder PowerCLI commands are used to create a custom image from the ESXi Offline 
Bundle and the vendor-provided bundle. In order to maintain the smallest footprint possible, not 
all supported hardware drivers are included with the native ESXi installation package.
The ESXi Offline Bundle contains two profiles: one that includes VMware toolsâthe standard 
profileâand one without VMware toolsâthe no-tools profile. A clone of the profile is created 
and the vendor software is added to it. When all of the necessary software have been added 
to the profile, it is exported to an ISO image that can be used to deploy ESXi hosts.
Custom image profiles created using the Image Builder PowerCLI commands are also used 
when using Auto Deploy to deploy stateless or stateful hosts. The procedure for creating a 
custom image profile to be used by Auto Deploy is the same, with the exception of the profile 
being exported to the custom ISO.
There's moreâ¦
Custom ESXi ISOs are also provided by manufacturers. Cisco, HP, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and other 
hardware manufacturers provide these custom ESXi ISO images, which can be downloaded from 
the My VMware portal using the Custom ISOs tab, as illustrated in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
157
These custom ISOs are preconfigured to include the drivers necessary for manufacturer-
specific hardware.
Best practices for ESXi host BIOS settings
The BIOS settings will vary depending on the hardware manufacturer and the BIOS version. 
Supported BIOS versions should be verified on the VMware HCL for the hardware selected.
The following screenshot shows the HCL details of a Dell PowerEdge R620 with the supported 
BIOS versions:

The vSphere Physical Design
158
If the hardware is supported, but the running BIOS version is not supported, the BIOS should 
be upgraded to a supported version.
How to do itâ¦
The BIOS settings will vary depending on the hardware manufacturer and the BIOS version. The 
settings available along with the layout and access will vary depending on BIOS manufacturer 
and BIOS version. The following screenshot is an example of a BIOS setup utility:
The following settings are provided as a guideline for optimizing the BIOS for an ESXi 
installation. Ask the hardware vendor for recommendations on settings specific to the 
hardware and BIOS versions:
1.	 Enable Intel VTx or AMD-V.
2.	 Enable Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT) or AMD Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI).
3.	 Disable node interleaving if the system supports non-uniform memory  
architecture (NUMA).
4.	 Enable Turbo Boost if the processor supports it.
5.	 Enable Hyper-Threading (HT) if supported by the processor.
6.	 Set Intel Execute Disable (XD) or AMD No Execute (NX) to Yes.
7.	
Set power-saving features to OS Control Mode.

Chapter 8
159
8.	 Enable the C1E halt state.
9.	 Disable any unnecessary hardware or features (floppy controllers, serial ports, USB 
controllers, and so on).
How it worksâ¦
Intel VTx, Intel EPT, AMD-V, and AMD RVI are hardware-based virtualization technologies 
that provide extensions to perform tasks normally handled by software to improve resource 
usage and enhance virtual-machine performance. Enabling Intel VTx or AMD-V is required if 
the host will be running 64-bit guests.
If the design calls for disabling Large Memory Pages in order to realize 
the advantages of Transparent Page Sharing (TPS) at times other 
than when there is memory contention, the Intel EPT or AMD RVI must 
be disabled. Enabling EPT or RVI will enforce large pages, even if they 
have been disabled in ESXi.
If the system is NUMA-capable, the option to enable node interleaving, which will disable 
NUMA, may be available. Enabling NUMA, by disabling node interleaving, will provide the best 
performance. This ensures that memory accessed by a processor is local to that processor or 
in the same NUMA node as that processor.
Enabling Turbo Boost will increase efficiency by balancing CPU workloads over unused cores.
Intel Hyper-Threading allows multiple threads to run on each core. When HT is enabled, the 
number of logical processors available is doubled. Each core is able to accept two concurrent 
threads of instructions.
Setting the power-saving features to OS Control Mode will allow ESXi to manage power saving 
on the host. If OS Control Mode is not available or supported, power-saving features should 
be disabled. Enabling the C1E halt state increases power savings.

Converting physical servers with vCenter Converter Standalone
Introduction
Virtual machine design is just as important as physical hardware design and should be part of 
the physical design process. Correctly designing and configuring virtual machines with proper 
resource allocation will help increase consolidation in the virtual environment and ensure that 
a virtual machine has access to the resources that it requires to run the workloads efficiently.
A few questions that should be answered as part of the virtual machine design are as follows:
f

What resources will be assigned to individual virtual machines?
f
f
How will new virtual machines be deployed?
f
f
How will multiple virtual machines supporting an application be grouped  
based on dependencies?

resources and ensure availability?
f
f
How will physical servers be converted to virtual machines?

The Virtual Machine Design
162
This chapter will cover right-sizing virtual machines to ensure that they have the resources 
they require without over-allocating resources. The chapter will cover how to create a virtual 
machine template and quickly deploy a virtual machine.
Configuring the ability to add CPU and memory resources without taking the virtual  
machine out of production will also be covered, along with how to group virtual machines into 
applications or vApps. We'll also discuss using affinity and anti-affinity rules on a DRS cluster 
to reduce the demand on a physical network or to provide application availability in the event 
of a host failure. Finally, the chapter will demonstrate how to convert a physical server to a 
virtual machine.
Right-sizing virtual machines
Right-sizing a virtual machine means allocating the correct amount of CPU, memory, and 
storage resources required to support a virtual machine's workload. Optimal performance of 
the virtual machine and efficient use of the underlying hardware are both obtained through 
right-sizing virtual machine resources.
In a physical server environment, it is difficult to add resources. Because of this, physical 
servers are often configured with more resources than actually required in order to ensure 
there are sufficient resources available if the need for resources increases. Typically, physical 
servers only use a small percentage of the resources available to them; this means that a 
great deal of resources are constantly kept idle or wasted. Adding resources to a physical 
server also typically requires the server to be powered off and possibly even removed from the 
rack, which takes even more time and impacts production.
In a virtual environment, it becomes much easier to add CPU, memory, and disk resources to 
a virtual machine. This eliminates the need to over-allocate resources. Virtual machines are 
configured with the resources they require, and more resources can be added as the demand 
increases. If a virtual machine has been configured to use CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug, 
additional resources can be added without taking the virtual machine out of production.
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following steps for right-sizing virtual machines:
1.	 Determine the CPU, memory, and storage resources required by the virtual machine.
When sizing virtual machine resources, start with the minimum 
requirements and add additional resources to the virtual 
machine as needed.
2.	 Adjust the virtual machine CPU, memory, and storage resource allocation to meet the 
requirements of the workload without over-allocating.

Chapter 9
163
How it worksâ¦
Tools such as VMware Capacity Planner or Windows Perfmon can be used to determine the 
actual resources required by an application running on a physical server. Resources used by 
a virtual machine can be examined using the vSphere Client program. From the Summary tab 
on the summary page of a virtual machine, it is easy to determine what CPU, memory, and 
disk resources have been allocated to the virtual machine along with the current usage of 
each of these resources, as shown in the following screenshot:
Performance charts can also be used to provide information about CPU and memory usage 
over time. The real-time advanced memory performance chart shown in the following 
screenshot shows the memory metrics of the Win7Client virtual machine:

The Virtual Machine Design
164
The chart options can be adjusted to show metrics for the last day, week, month, or even the 
last year. These metrics can be used to determine if a virtual machine has been allocated 
more memory than required.
Once the resource requirements have been identified, the virtual machine resources can 
be modified or right-sized to ensure that a virtual machine has not been allocated more 
resources than required for the workload running on it.
vCenter Operations Manager (vCOPs) is a separate VMware product that can be used to 
monitor the resources used by a virtual machine and has capacity planning and efficiency 
monitoring specific to right-sizing virtual machines. More information on vCOPs can be found 
at http://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-operations-management/.
Enabling CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug
Adding CPU and memory resources to a virtual machine is a simple process. The process to 
add resources to a virtual machine is to power down the virtual machine, increase the number 
of vCPUs or amount of memory, and power on the virtual machine again.
In vSphere 4.0, two new features, CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug, were introduced 
to allow for virtual machine vCPUs and virtual machine memory to be increased without 
requiring for the virtual machine to be powered off. CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug 
must first be enabled on the virtual machine, which does require it to be powered off. Once 
enabled, however, CPU and memory resources may be added dynamically; powering off the 
virtual machine is not necessary.
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following steps to enable vCPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug for virtual machines:
1.	 Check the VMware Guest OS Compatibility Guide that can be found at http://
partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/pdf/VMware_GOS_Compatibility_
Guide.pdf to identify if vCPU and memory hot-adding is supported for the virtual 
machine guest operating system. The following screenshot is from the VMware Guest 
OS Compatibility Guide and shows the Hot Add Memory and Hot Add vCPU support 
for Windows Server 2008 Datacenter Edition R2 with Service Pack 1 on ESXi 5.x:
2.	 To configure CPU Hot Add or Memory Hot Plug for a virtual machine, it must be 
powered off first.

Chapter 9
165
3.	 To enable CPU Hot Add on the virtual machine, edit the virtual machine settings and 
expand the CPU settings. Select the Enable CPU Hot Add checkbox as shown in the 
following screenshot:
4.	 To enable Memory Hot Plug, expand the Memory settings and select the Enable 
checkbox for Memory Hot Plug (*) as shown in the following screenshot:

The Virtual Machine Design
166
5.	 Once CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug have been enabled for a virtual machine, 
the virtual machine can be powered back on.
6.	 vCPUs or memory can now be added to the running virtual machine without having to 
shut it down.
How it worksâ¦
Once CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug have been enabled on a virtual machine, it will not 
be necessary to power off the virtual machine to add additional vCPUs or additional memory.
Though vCPUs and memory can be added while the virtual machine is 
running, once Hot Add / Hot Plug has been enabled, some operating 
systems may require for the guest to be rebooted before the added 
vCPUs or memory is recognized by the operating system.
Enabling the CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug features does increase the virtual  
machine overhead reservation slightly. Also, remember that when a virtual machine's memory 
is increased, the virtual machine swap file (.vswp) also increases to the size of the allocated 
memory (minus any memory reservations). The swap file grows automatically when the virtual 
machine's memory is increased.
CPU resources do not have to be added in "twos". If a virtual machine 
requires the resources associated with three CPUs, three vCPUs 
can be assigned to the virtual machine. It is also not necessary to 
allocate virtual machine memory in GB increments; a virtual machine 
can be allocated 1,256 MB of memory if that is what is necessary to 
meet resource requirements.
With CPU Hot Add and Memory Hot Plug enabled, the removal of vCPUs and memory from a 
virtual machine will, more than likely, still require that the virtual machine be powered off or 
the operating system be rebooted before the resources are removed or before the removal of 
resources is recognized by the guest operating system.
Creating virtual machine templates
Virtual machines can be deployed quickly from prebuilt templates. Virtual machine templates 
are configured with minimum CPU, memory, and storage resources. The guest operating 
system and any prerequisite applications are installed in the template. Instead of taking hours 
(or even days in some cases) to install the operating system and prepare the server, once a 
template has been created, a new virtual machine can be deployed within minutes. Virtual 
machine templates not only allow for quick deployment but also help maintain consistency 
across virtual machines deployed in the environment.

Chapter 9
167
How to do itâ¦
The following steps are required to create a virtual machine template:
1.	 Create a virtual machine; configure the vCPU, memory, and storage resources; 
install the guest operating system; install the required applications; and apply any 
application or operating system updates or patches.
2.	 The virtual machine can be cloned to a template using the Clone to Template wizard 
as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 The virtual machine can also be converted to a template using the Convert to 
Template wizard as shown in the following screenshot:

The Virtual Machine Design
168
4.	 Once the virtual machine template has been created, new virtual machines can  
be deployed from the template using the Deploy VM from this Template wizard  
as shown in the following screenshot:
How it worksâ¦
When cloning a virtual machine to a template, the Clone to Template wizard allows the 
administrator to choose the datacenter, cluster, and storage to create the new virtual machine 
template. Cloning a virtual machine to a template can be done while the source virtual 
machine is powered on.
When a virtual machine is converted to a template, the virtual machine is converted locally; the 
template will have the same inventory properties (datacenter, cluster, and storage) as the virtual 
machine that has been converted. The virtual machine configuration file (.vmx) is changed to 
a template configuration file (.vmtx) when a virtual machine is converted. The virtual machine 
needs to be powered off in order to be converted to a virtual machine template.
The following screenshot shows the virtual machine template files on a datastore (the virtual 
machine template configuration file has been boxed in red):

Chapter 9
169
The virtual machine template file is similar to the .vmx file and contains configuration 
information about the virtual hardware presented to the virtual machine or template.
There's moreâ¦
A guest customization specification can be applied to a virtual machine that is being deployed 
from a template. The customization specification allows settings unique to the deployed virtual 
machine to be applied during the deployment process. These custom specifications include 
information such as the computer's name, licensing, IP address, and domain membership. 
The New VM Guest Customization Spec wizard is displayed in the following screenshot:

The Virtual Machine Design
170
The customization specification can be saved so it can be applied to future virtual machines 
deployed from templates. Guest customization specifications can also be applied when 
cloning a virtual machine.
Using vApps to organize virtualized 
applications
vApps can be used to group individual virtual machines with interdependencies into a single 
application. A common use case for this would be a multitier web application that requires 
a web server frontend, an application server, and the supporting database server. The 
application can then be managed as a single inventory object.
How to do itâ¦
The following steps are to be performed for using vApps to organize virtual machine workloads:
1.	 Create a new vApp by launching the New vApp wizard as shown in the  
following screenshot:
2.	 The method for creating the vApp (either creating a new vApp or cloning an existing 
vApp), the vApp name, the folder location, and the resource allocation settings are 
configured in the New vApp wizard as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
171
3.	 Once the vApp has been created, you can add virtual machines to the new vApp by 
dragging them into the vApp. The following screenshot shows a vApp containing the 
Prod1 and Prod2 virtual machines:

The Virtual Machine Design
172
4.	 The settings of the vApp can be edited. In the following screenshot, Start order 
is configured to start virtual machines in the vApp in a specific order. Start order 
ensures that virtual machines are started in order of their dependency when the 
vApp is powered on:
How it worksâ¦
A vApp is a container of virtual machines that support an application. Once placed in a vApp, 
startup and shutdown can be configured based on application dependencies, resources can 
be reserved or limited, and the entire vApp can be exported in the OVA or OVF format. A vApp 
can also be cloned to duplicate the application.

Chapter 9
173
Using VM affinity and anti-affinity rules
When virtual machines are powered on in a DRS cluster, vCenter determines where the virtual 
machines should be placed in order to balance resource usage across the cluster. The DRS 
scheduler runs periodically to migrate virtual machines using vMotion, to maintain a balance 
of resource usage across the cluster. Affinity or anti-affinity rules can be used to control where 
VMs are placed within a cluster. Affinity rules keep VMs on the same physical host, reducing 
the load on the physical network by keeping traffic between them from leaving the host.  
Anti-affinity rules keep VMs separated on different physical hosts, ensuring higher availability.
One case of an affinity rule would be to keep all of the virtual machines supporting an 
application on the same host. This would ensure that network communications between the 
virtual machines supporting the application do not traverse the physical network.
An example use case of an anti-affinity rule would be to keep multiple virtual Active Directory 
domain controllers running on separate hosts to ensure that all of the domain controllers are 
not affected by a host failure.
How to do itâ¦
The following steps are required for using VM affinity and anti-affinity rules:
1.	 DRS rules are created on the Settings page of a DRS-enabled cluster, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

The Virtual Machine Design
174
2.	 DRS rules can be created for three purposes: to Keep Virtual Machines Together 
on the same host, to Separate Virtual Machines across different hosts, or to assign 
Virtual Machines to Hosts, as shown in the following screenshot:
How it worksâ¦
With the DRS rules configured, the distributed resource scheduler will apply the rules when 
determining the placement of virtual machines when they are powered on or when migrating 
virtual machines to other hosts in order to balance the cluster resource usage.

Chapter 9
175
When an affinity rule has been configured to keep several virtual machines together, if DRS 
migrates one of the virtual machines in the rule, all the virtual machines configured will also 
be migrated to the new host. When an anti-affinity rule has been configured to keep virtual 
machines separated, DRS will not migrate a virtual machine to a host running another virtual 
machine configured in the rule.
Virtual Machine to Hosts rules can be created while keeping virtual machines on specific 
hosts or groups of hosts. These types of DRS rules are useful for keeping management virtual 
machines, such as vCenter Server, on specific hosts to make these virtual machines easier to 
find in the event of a failure.
Converting physical servers with vCenter 
Converter Standalone
There are two methods for virtualizing workloads running on physical servers. The workloads 
can be migrated into the virtual environment by creating new virtual machines, loading a 
guest operating system, installing applications, and migrating the application data to the new 
virtual machines; or, physical servers can directly be converted to virtual machines using 
VMware vCenter Converter Standalone.
How to do itâ¦
The following steps are required for using VMware vCenter Converter Standalone:
1.	 Download VMware Converter from http://www.vmware.com/web/vmware/
downloads.
VMware Converter can be installed either as a local installation or as a client-server 
installation. More information on installing VMware Converter is available in the 
VMware vCenter Converter Standalone guide found at http://www.vmware.com/
support/pubs/converter_pubs.html.
The local installation is used to convert the physical machine that the 
converter is installed on.
When installed using the client-server installation, the local machine 
becomes a server that can be managed remotely using the Converter 
Standalone client to convert physical servers.

The Virtual Machine Design
176
2.	 Once VMware Converter has been installed, the VMware vCenter Converter 
Standalone client is used to connect to the Converter server, either local or installed 
on a remote machine. The VMware vCenter Converter Standalone login dialog is 
shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 To convert a machine, select Convert machine to start the conversion wizard as 
shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 The first step of the conversion is to select the Source System type. This is the type 
of system that will be converted to the virtual environment. The source type can be 
Powered-on machine (physical or virtual), VMware Infrastructure virtual machine, 
Backup image or third-party virtual machine, or Hyper-V Server.

Chapter 9
177
5.	 Once the source type has been selected, specify the powered-on virtual machine's 
information. This is the machine that will be converted and can either be the local 
machine or a remote machine. To convert a remote machine, the IP address or name 
field must be filled in along with administrator credentials and the OS Family field. If 
converting the local machine, the user running the converter must have administrator 
access to the local machine. The following screenshot shows a sample Source 
System configuration to convert a remote powered-on machine:

The Virtual Machine Design
178
6.	 Once the source system information has been provided, the Converter Standalone 
agent will be installed on the source system. Once the conversion is finished, the 
agent can be uninstalled automatically or manually:
7.	
Once the Converter Standalone agent has been successfully installed, the 
destination system where the source system will be converted is configured. The 
destination type, the destination IP address, and the destination credentials are 
configured. The following screenshot shows the configuration of a vCenter Server  
as the Destination System:

Chapter 9
179
8.	 Information about the Destination Virtual Machine, such as the name and the 
virtual machine inventory placement, is then configured. The following screenshot 
shows the name and inventory placement for a physical-to-virtual conversion:

The Virtual Machine Design
180
9.	 The Destination Location is then selected, as shown in the following screenshot. 
This location is the datacenter, cluster, or host that the converted machine will be 
deployed to. The datastore where the converted machine configuration file (.vmx)  
will reside and the virtual machine version to use is also configured here:

Chapter 9
181
10.	 A number of options can be configured for the converted machine, including what 
virtual machine network to connect to, what datastore to deploy the converted disk to 
and in what format, and the device configuration. The following screenshot shows the 
Options configuration screen with the volume configuration for the machine that is 
being converted:

The Virtual Machine Design
182
11.	 The Summary screen is displayed where the conversion options can be reviewed 
before starting the conversion process. An example Summary dialog is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 9
183
12.	Once the conversion starts, the progress can be monitored in the VMware vCenter 
Converter Standalone client as shown in the following screenshot. The client allows 
for multiple conversions to be configured and run simultaneously:
How it worksâ¦
When a physical server is converted using vCenter Converter Standalone, the physical server 
is cloned into the virtual environment. This creates a copy of the physical server as a virtual 
machine containing a duplicate of the operating system, applications, and data from the 
physical server.
When the physical server is converted, new virtual hardware is presented to the virtual machine. 
The physical hardware that was associated with the virtual machines is no longer present and 
references to it should be removed. In Windows, this is done using the Device Manager.
During the physical-to-virtual conversion, the physical hardware is replaced 
with virtual hardware. During the conversion, references to the physical 
hardware and the associated drivers are not removed from the operating 
system. To remove non-present hardware from a Windows Server, set an 
environment variable devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices to 1. This 
will enable non-present devices to be visible in the Device Manager.
The conversion can be verified by booting the new virtual machine while it is disconnected 
from the virtual switch and checking that the operating system and applications were 
converted correctly. Once verified, the physical server can be powered off or removed from the 
network, and the newly converted virtual machine can be connected to the network.
The migration of servers and applications can be time consuming, and vCenter Converter 
Standalone provides a way to quickly convert physical servers to virtual machines.

Introduction
The factors that influence the design of the backup and recovery of the virtual datacenter 
are Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO defines the 
amount of data loss that is acceptable. RTO is the amount of time it should take to restore an 
application or service a workload after an outage.
The acceptable RPO and RTO should be defined for each workload. It is important to consider 
the application's dependencies when determining the RPO and RTO. Specifically, the RTO of 
an application will depend on the RTO of all of the application's dependencies. For example, 
if an application depends on a database server and the RTO of the database server is 
determined to be two hours, the RTO of the application itself cannot be less than two hours 
if the outage affects both the server running the application and the database server that 
supports the application.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
186
vSphere provides many options that provide the continued operation of the virtual machines 
and the workloads they run in the event of an outage. These solutions do not replace the need 
for virtual machine backups.
The following are two different methods for backing up virtual machine workloads:
f
f
Traditional backup using in-guest backup agents
f
f
Agentless backup using the vSphere Storage APIsâData Protection
The backup and recovery design should not only include virtual machines but also the 
backups of the virtual infrastructure configuration containing the management, network, and 
other configurations. This ensures that the virtual infrastructure can be restored after a failure 
within the infrastructure, such as a host failure or a vCenter failure.
Backing up vCenter and the supporting vCenter databases was covered in Chapter 4, The 
vSphere Management Design. This chapter will cover backing up some of the infrastructure 
components. This includes backing up the ESXi host and the virtual distributed switch 
configurations to ensure that the infrastructure can be restored in the event of an outage.
VMware provides several products to back up virtual machines and recover them in the 
event of a virtual machine or infrastructure failure. This chapter demonstrates many of these 
options including the deployment and basic configurations for the protection and recovery of 
virtual machines. The backup and recovery solution that will be selected will depend on the 
design factors.
Backing up ESXi host configurations
A full backup of an ESXi host is not necessary because the installation of ESXi is a quick 
and simple process. Host configurations should be backed up in order to quickly restore the 
configuration of a host in case ESXi needs to be reinstalled.
If hosts are deployed using Auto Deploy or the host configurations are stored in a host profile, 
the individual backups of host configurations may not be necessary but are a good way to 
ensure that a backup of the host configuration is available in case there is an issue with 
vCenter or a configured host profile.
How to do it...
The simplest way to back up ESXi host configurations is to use the vicfg-cfgbackup vCLI 
command as shown in the following steps:
1.	 Use the vicfg-cfgbackup vCLI command to create a backup of an ESXi  
host configuration:
vicfg-cfgbackup âserver <esxihostname> -s <pathtobackupfile>

Chapter 10
187
2.	 Use the vicfg-cfgbackup vCLI command to restore an ESXi host configuration 
from a backup:
vicfg-cfgbackup âserver <esxihostname> -l <pathtobackupfile>
How it worksâ¦
The vSphere Command-line Interface (vCLI) can be downloaded from VMware at  
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/ and installed on a Windows PC 
or Linux workstation. vCLI is also included as part of the vSphere Management Assistant 
(vMA) found at https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=352&dow
nloadGroup=VMA550, which can be deployed in the vSphere environment.
The ESXi backup is saved to the specified file. This file is not human-readable but contains the 
configuration information of the ESXi host and can be used to restore the configuration in the 
event that the host is lost and has to be reinstalled. The backup can also be used to return 
the host to a known good configuration if a configuration change is made that negatively 
impacts the host.
A configuration backup should be made before upgrading hosts or before making 
configuration changes to a host.
Restoring a host configuration using vicfg-cfgbackup will require the host to be rebooted 
once the restoration has been completed. This will cause any virtual machines on the host to 
be shut down. The host should be placed in the maintenance mode, and all running virtual 
machines should be vMotioned to other hosts if possible.
A full documentation on the vicfg-cfgbackup vCLI command can 
be found in the vSphere documentation at http://pubs.vmware.
com/vsphere-55/topic/com.vmware.vcli.ref.doc/
vicfg-cfgbackup.html.
There's moreâ¦
An ESXi host configuration backup can also be performed using PowerCLI with the Get-
VMHostFirmware PowerCLI cmdlet as shown in the following command line:
Get-VMHostFirmware âvmhost <hostname or IP Address> -BackupConfiguration 
âDestinationPath<PathtoBackupLocation>

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
188
The following screenshot demonstrates a host configuration backup using PowerCLI and the 
Get-VMHostFirmware cmdlet:
To restore the ESXi host configuration, the Set-VMHostFirmware PowerCLI cmdlet is used:
Set-VMHostFirmware âvmhost <hostname or IP Address> -Restore âSourcePath<
PathtoBackupLocation>
As with restoring the ESXi configuration using vicfg-cfgbackup, the host will be rebooted 
once the configuration is restored. The Set-VMHostFirmware cmdlet will not run against an 
ESXi host that has not been placed in the maintenance mode.
Configuring ESXi host logging
Having access to the ESXi host logs is required in order to troubleshoot or determine the root 
cause of an ESXi host failure. Redirecting host logs to persistent storage or to a Syslog server 
is especially important when a host has not been installed to persistent storage, for example, 
a stateless host deployed using vSphere Auto Deploy or a host that has been installed to a 
USB stick.
Logging may not seem to be a key component in disaster recovery. Having a proper backup of 
the host configuration allows a host to be quickly returned to a service, but if the root cause 
of the failure cannot be determined, preventing the failure from happening again cannot be 
guaranteed. Logs are the best source for performing analyses to determine the root cause of 
a failure and to determine the best course of action required to prevent future failures.

Chapter 10
189
How to do itâ¦
ESXi logs should be redirected to the persistent storage or sent to a central Syslog server 
in order to ensure that the logs are available for analysis after a host failure. The following 
process details how to configure ESXi logging:
1.	 To redirect host logs, select the host and edit Advanced System Settings on the 
Manage tab. Use the Filter box to display the Syslog settings, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
2.	 Edit the Syslog.global.logDir setting in order to set the datastore path to output the 
logs to. This can be set to a VMFS or NFS datastore, which has been configured on 
the host, as shown in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
190
3.	 Edit the Syslog.global.logDirUnique setting to create a unique subdirectory for each 
host under Syslog.global.logDir. This setting is useful if logs from multiple hosts are 
being stored in the same directory. The following screenshot displays the enabling of 
the Syslog.global.logDirUnique setting by selecting the Yes option:
4.	 If the host logs are set to a central Syslog server, edit the Syslog.global.logHost setting 
and enter the FQDN or IP address of the Syslog server. The following screenshot shows 
the advanced configuration option for setting Syslog.global.logHost:
How it worksâ¦
When Syslog.global.logDir is configured, host logfiles will be stored in the configured path. 
The following screenshot shows an example of a host configured with Syslog.global.logDir  
set to [datastore1] scratch/log and Syslog.global.logDirUnique set to Yes.

Chapter 10
191
With Syslog.global.logDirUnique set to Yes, a subdirectory with the FQDN of the host is 
created to store the logfiles. If Syslog.global.logHost has been configured, the host logs are 
sent to a centralized Syslog server. The host logs can be sent to multiple Syslog servers by 
separating the servers with a comma. The ESXi host logs can be configured to be stored on 
persistent storage and to also be sent to a central Syslog server.
Backing up virtual distributed switch 
configurations
Virtual distributed switch configurations can be exported to a file. The file contains the switch 
configuration settings and can also contain information of the dvPortGroup configurations. 
This file can then be used to restore the virtual distributed switch  configuration or to import 
the configuration into a different deployment.
Virtual distributed switch import, export, and restore operations 
are available in the vSphere Web Client.
Virtual distributed switch configurations should be exported before making changes to the 
distributed virtual switches in a production environment in order to ensure that the switch  
can be restored to an operational state in the event of a configuration error.
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following procedure to create a backup of the VDS configuration:
1.	 In the vSphere Web Client, right-click on the VDS to be exported. Navigate to All 
vCenter Actions | Export Configurationâ¦ as shown in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
192
2.	 Select an option depending on whether you want to export the distributed switch and 
all of the port groups or the distributed switch only. Selecting the Distributed switch 
only option exports only the virtual distributed switch configuration and does not 
include any configurations for the port groups associated with the dvSwitch. Give the 
exported configurations a short description as illustrated in the following screenshot:
3.	 Select Yes when the Confirm Configuration Export dialog is displayed. The Confirm 
Configuration Export dialog box is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
193
4.	 Select the local path to which you want to save the configuration, and specify a 
filename for the exported configuration, as shown in the following screenshot:
How it worksâ¦
Once exported, the configuration file will contain all of the settings for VDS and the 
dvPortgroup configurations. This file can then be used to restore the VDS configurations of an 
existing distributed switch or to import the configurations if VDS is accidently deleted or lost.
Restoring the VDS configuration from the exported configuration file is a simple process. 
Right-click on the VDS to be restored and navigate to All vCenter Actions | Restore 
Configurationâ¦, as shown in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
194
When restoring or importing a VDS from an exported configuration file, we can use one of the 
two options: Restore distributed switch and all port groups or Restore distributed switch 
only, as shown in the following screenshot:
When using the Restore distributed switch only option, only the distributed switch 
configuration is restored. The dvPortGroups and their associated configurations are not 
restored. If the Restore distributed switch and all port groups option is selected, the virtual 
distributed switch configuration and the associated dvPortgroups are restored. Note that 
during the restore process, the current settings of the distributed virtual switch and the 
associated dvPortgroups will be overwritten.
Deploying VMware Data Protection
vSphere Data Protection (VDP) is an easy-to-deploy, Linux-based virtual appliance that 
leverages EMC Avamar to provide a disk-based backup of the virtual machines. Two 
deployment options are available. The first option is VDP, which is included free with VMware 
Essential Plus or a higher licensing, and the second is VDP Advanced (VDPA), which is a 
separately licensed product. VDP facilitates deduplicated, full virtual machine image backups. 
These backups can be replicated to a remote Avamar grid or to another VDP appliance. VDPA 
includes agents for the message-level backups of Microsoft Exchange and the database 
backups of Microsoft SQL Server.
How to do itâ¦
In order to deploy VDP, perform the following steps:
1.	 Download the VMware Data Protection Appliance from http://www.vmware.com/
go/download-vsphere.

Chapter 10
195
2.	 Deploy the vSphere Data Protection Appliance from the OVA. Enter the appliance's 
network configuration information during the OVA deployment as shown in the 
following screenshot:
3.	 When the OVA deployment is complete and the VDP appliance is powered on, 
visit https://<vdp-ip-address>:8543/vdp-configure to complete the 
appliance's configuration. Log in to the appliance for the first time using the 
username root and the default password changeme.
4.	 Once you are logged in, the initial configuration wizard starts to configure the  
VDP appliance.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
196
5.	 The first step performed by the wizard is verifying the network settings, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
The wizard verifies whether the appliance's hostname can be resolved 
in DNS. Forward and reverse DNS entries will need to be configured 
before the network settings can be saved successfully.
6.	 The configuration wizard will then prompt you to choose the time zone. Select the 
time zone as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
197
7.	
The default VDP password must be changed. Enter the VDP password, taking note of 
the password requirements. The wizard will place green checks next to the rules that 
the password meets. The password must meet all the password rules, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
8.	 The VDP appliance is then registered with vCenter. Enter values for vCenter 
username, vCenter password, vCenter FQDN or IP, and vCenter port, as  
shown in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
198
9.	 Create a new storage for the VDP backups. This can be configured from 0.5 TB to 2 TB 
per VDP appliance. The Create Storage dialog is displayed in the following screenshot:
10.	 Choose where you want the VDP storage disks allocated. The storage disk can be 
stored with the appliance or on a specified datastore. The provisioning method for  
the storage disk can also be configured, as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 On completion of the VDP configuration, the following screen is shown:

12.	Select the Run performance analysis on storage configuration and Restart the 
appliance if successful checkboxes.
13.	When you are prompted to start the storage configuration, select Yes to begin 
the process. A status window is displayed as the configuration is applied. The 
configuration will take some time to complete, 30 minutes or more, and the appliance 
will reboot once the configuration process has been completed successfully. The 
following screenshot shows the configuration status window:
14.	 The progress can also be monitored using the Tasks tab in the vSphere Web Client as 
shown in the following screenshot:

15.	Once the configuration has been completed and the VDP appliance restarts, the 
vSphere Data Protection management option will be available in the vSphere Web 
Client. The following screenshot shows the VDP connection screen in the vSphere 
Web Client:
How it worksâ¦
During the VDP appliance OVA deployment, the initial network settings are configured which 
includes the network address of the appliance, the subnet mask, the default gateway, and the 
primary DNS.
Once the appliance has been deployed and powered on, the VDP configuration wizard is 
used to verify the network configurations, configure the hostname and domain, set the root 
password of the appliance, configure the timezone, and register the appliance with a vCenter 
server. The configuration of the storage for the virtual machine backups is also configured.
After the initial configuration and analysis has completed, the appliance will reboot and can 
then be managed using the vSphere Web Client. Backup jobs to protect virtual machines can 
then be created through the vSphere Web Client
Using VMware Data Protection to back up 
virtual machines
Virtual machine backups using the VDP appliance are created and managed using the 
vSphere Web Client connected to vCenter, where the VDP appliance has been registered.

Chapter 10
201
How to do itâ¦
Perform the following steps to create a backup job in order to protect virtual machines  
using VDP:
1.	 In the vSphere Web Client, select vSphere Data Protection and connect to the  
VDP appliance.
2.	 Select the Backup tab, and from the Backup job actions menu, select New, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Select the type of backup to be performed: either a Full Image, which is a  
complete backup of the virtual machine including all the disks and configurations,  
or Individual Disks, which are individual virtual machine disks (VMDKs), as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
202
4.	 Select the backup targets. Targets can be vCenter inventory objects including 
datacenters, clusters, resource pools, or individual virtual machines. The following 
screenshot illustrates selecting two individual virtual machines to be a part of this 
backup job:
5.	 Create a schedule of the backup job. The Schedule determines how often and when 
the backup job will run. The following screenshot demonstrates a daily schedule with 
the start time of 8:00 P.M.:

Chapter 10
203
6.	 Set a retention policy for the backup job. Retention Policy determines for how long 
the backups are retained. In the following screenshot, the retention policy has been 
set to 30 days:
7.	
Set a job name for the backup job. It can be helpful if the name is a short description 
of the backup job, as shown in the following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
204
8.	 A Ready to Complete screen is shown to allow the configuration settings to be 
reviewed, as shown in the following screenshot:
9.	 Once completed, the backup job is created and will run according to the  
configured schedule.
How it worksâ¦
Backup jobs are created in order to back up virtual machines or groups of virtual machines. 
Backup jobs include the backup targets, the backup schedule, and the backup retention policy.
The best RPO that can be obtained for a single backup job is 24 hours because only a single 
daily backup can be configured. If the RPO for a specific virtual machine or a group of virtual 
machines is less than 24 hours, multiple backup jobs will need to be created. For example, if 
the RPO for a virtual machine is 6 hours, four daily backup jobs configured to start at 12:00 
A.M., 6:00 A.M., 12:00 P.M., and 6:00 P.M. would need to be created to meet the RPO.
Once the backup jobs have run, the virtual machines can be restored to their original location 
or to a different location. Restoring to a different location provides a way to test the virtual 
machine backups without impacting the running virtual machine.
File-level restores can also be performed by connecting to the VDP appliance from the backup 
target. To access file-level restores, visit https://vdp-appliance-ip:8543/flr from  
the virtual machine that has been backed up. The file-level restore client is shown in the 
following screenshot:

205
The health of the appliance, current usage, and status of the backup jobs can be monitored 
using the Reports tab, as shown in the following screenshot:

Replicating virtual machines with vSphere 
Replication
vSphere Replication is included for free with vSphere Essentials Plus or higher. vSphere 
Replication allows virtual machines to be replicated between sites or between datastores on 
the same site. vSphere Replication leverages Change Block Tracking (CBT) to only replicate 
changes between the source virtual machines and the replication target.
vSphere Replication appliances are deployed at each site participating in replication. Multiple 
vSphere Replication appliances can be deployed to improve replication performance.
How to do itâ¦
To deploy vSphere Replication and configure a virtual machine for replication, perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Download the vSphere Replication appliance from http://www.vmware.com/go/
download-vsphere.
2.	 The vSphere Replication appliance is deployed from an OVA. During OVA deployment, 
the initial configuration of the administrator password, the database, and the 
management network IP address are configured as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
207
3.	 Once the vSphere Replication appliance has been deployed, it can be managed from 
the vSphere Web Client as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Replication can now be configured for virtual machines. To enable replication, 
right-click on the virtual machine to be replicated. Then, navigate to All vSphere 
Replication Actions | Configure Replication from the menu, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
208
5.	 The replication wizard walks through the configuration of Target site, Replication 
server, Target location, and Replication options. The following screenshot displays 
the Configure Replication wizard for a virtual machine:

Chapter 10
209
6.	 The Recovery settings menu allows you to configure Recovery Point Objective 
(RPO), time between replications, and the number of Point in time instances to keep 
of the replicated virtual machine. The best RPO that can be realized with vSphere 
Replication is 15 minutes. The following screenshot shows the configuration of an 
RPO of 15 minutes for the selected virtual machine:

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
210
7.	
Once replication for a virtual machine has been configured, the replication can be 
monitored in the vSphere Web Client. The following screenshot shows the status of 
Initial Full Sync on a virtual machine that has been configured for replication:
How it worksâ¦
After the initial synchronization has been completed, the vSphere kernel tracks the writes to 
the protected virtual machine and transfers only the blocks that have changed. The following 
diagram illustrates the traffic flow for a virtual machine replicated with vSphere Replication:
Changed Blocks

211
Here, VM1 has been configured for replication. Changed blocks are tracked and transferred to 
the target vSphere Replication appliance.
Once a replication has been set up, it can be recovered from the vSphere Replication 
management by selecting the replicated virtual machine and choosing Recover,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
Protecting the virtual datacenter with Site 
Recovery Manager
Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is a VMware product that provides a framework for automating 
the protection and failover between VMware virtualized datacenters. SRM is licensed as a 
separate product. Licensing is per VM protected and there are two license editions: Standard 
and Enterprise. The Standard Edition provides for the protection of up to 75 virtual machines, 
and the Enterprise Edition can protect an unlimited number of virtual machines.
A complete book can be dedicated to the implementation and use of SRM. This book is  
just meant to be a quick overview of the configuration and capabilities of SRM. More 
information on the implementation and use of SRM can be found in the SRM  
documentation at http://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/srm_pubs.html.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
212
How to do itâ¦
Protecting the datacenter using SRM is accomplished through the following process:
1.	 Identify the requirements of Site Recovery Manager.
2.	 Deploy Site Recovery Manager at the protected and recovery sites.
3.	 Configure connections between the protected and recovery sites.
4.	 Establish virtual machine replication between the protected and recovery sites.
5.	 Create resource mapping between the protected and recovery sites.
6.	 Create protection groups containing the virtual machines to be protected.
7.	
Configure recovery plans to automate the recovery of virtual machines.
8.	 Test the recovery plan to ensure that it will operate as expected.
How it worksâ¦
SRM does not provide for the protection of virtual machines. It provides a way to easily 
automate and manage the protection and failover of virtual machines. The SRM service 
runs on a Windows server and requires a supported database. Supported databases for the 
deployed SRM version can be found on the product and solution interoperability matrix at 
http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/sim/interop_matrix.php.
Virtual machines can be replicated between sites using either vSphere Replication or  
array-based replication. If array-based replication is used, a supported Storage Replication 
Adapter (SRA) is installed on the SRM servers at each site. SRA communicates with the array 
to control replication flow during normal, failover, and failback operations.
vSphere Replication can be deployed independently, or it can be deployed as part of the SRM 
installation. vSphere Replication connectivity between sites can be configured and managed 
from within SRM.
SRM configuration and management can only be done using 
the thick vSphere Client. It cannot be managed using the 
vSphere Web Client.

Chapter 10
213
The following diagram illustrates a basic SRM architecture using both vSphere Replication and 
array-based replication between the protected and recovery sites.

Compute resources (datacenters, clusters, and resource pools) and network resources on the 
protected site are mapped to the resources at the recovery site. For example, the port group 
named Production VM Network at the protected site is mapped to a port group named Failover 
VM Network at the recovery site. The resource must exist at the recovery site before they 
can be mapped. A placeholder datastore is configured to hold the protected virtual machine 
configuration files at the recovery site.
Protection groups are created and contain virtual machines that are protected. When virtual 
machines are added to a protection group, a placeholder configuration file is created at the 
recovery site on the placeholder datastore. Protection groups can be used to group virtual 
machines that should be recovered together to ensure that workload dependencies are met. 
For example, an application that includes a virtual machine running a web frontend and 
another virtual machine running the support database can be placed in a protection group to 
ensure that all of the workload dependencies are recovered when a failover is initiated.
Recovery plans contain protection groups. Multiple recovery plans can be created, and a 
protection group can be included in more than one recovery plan. For example, a recovery 
plan can be created for a single protection group to facilitate recovery, or a single application 
and another recovery plan can be created to include all the configured protection groups in 
order to facilitate the recovery of the entire site.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
214
As part of the recovery plan, the virtual machine startup order can be configured with virtual 
machine network options. If the virtual machine network configuration (IP address or DNS 
servers) needs to be changed during recovery, the virtual machine network options are set on 
the individual virtual machines in the recovery plan. VMware Tools must be installed on the 
virtual machines if network changes are required.
A recovery plan can be tested without impacting the protected virtual machines by running a 
recovery test. During the test, an isolated vSwitchâa vSwitch with no uplinksâwill be created 
at the recovery site. When virtual machines are recovered during the test, they are connected 
to this isolated switch. Once the test recovery has been completed, the virtual machine can 
be verified at the recovery site. Once the test has been completed and verified, the cleanup 
operation can be run to return the virtual machines to a protected state.

Implementing the design
Introduction
The design documentation provides written documentation of the design factors and the 
choices the architect has made in the design to satisfy the business and technical requirements.
The design documentation also aids in the implementation of the design. In many cases 
where the design architect is not responsible for the implementation, the design documents 
ensure the successful implementation of the design by the implementation engineer.
Once you have created the documentation for a few designs, you will 
be able to develop standard processes and templates to aid in the 
creation of design documentation.

The Design Documentation
216
Documentation can vary from project to project. Many consulting companies and resellers 
have standard documentation templates that they use when designing solutions. A properly 
documented design should include the following information:
f
f
Architecture design
f
f
Implementation plan
f
f
Installation guide
f
f
Validation test plan
f
f
Operational procedures
This information can be included in a single document or separated into different documents.
VMware provides Service Delivery Kits to VMware partners. These kits can be found on the 
VMware Partner University portal at http://www.vmware.com/go/partneruniversity, 
which provides documentation templates that can be used as a foundation for creating design 
documents. If you do not have access to these templates, example outlines are provided in 
this chapter to assist you in developing your own design documentation templates.
The final steps of the design process include gaining customer approval to begin 
implementation of the design and the implementation of the design.
Creating the architecture design document
The architecture design document is a technical document describing the components and 
specifications required to support the solution and ensure that the specific business and 
technical requirements of the design are satisfied.
An excellent example of an architecture design document is the Cloud 
Infrastructure Architecture Case Study White Paper article that can be 
found at http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/
cloud-infrastructure-achitecture-case-study.pdf.
The architect creates the architecture design document to document the design factors and 
the specific choices that have been made to satisfy those factors. The document serves as a 
way for the architect to show his work when making design decisions. The architecture design 
document includes the conceptual, logical, and physical designs.

Chapter 11

How to do it...
The architecture design document should include the following information:
f

Design methodology
f
f
Conceptual design
f
f
Logical management, storage, compute, and network design
f
f
Physical management, storage, compute, and network design
How it works...
The Purpose and Overview section of the architecture design includes the Executive Summary 
section. The Executive Summary section provides a high-level overview of the design and 
the goals the design will accomplish, and defines the purpose and scope of the architecture 
design document.
The following is an example executive summary in the Cloud Infrastructure Architecture Case 
Study White Paper:
Executive Summary: This architecture design was developed to support a 
virtualization project to consolidate 100 existing physical servers on to a  
VMware vSphere 5.x virtual infrastructure. The primary goals this design will 
accomplish are to increase operational efficiency and to provide high availability  
of customer-facing applications.
This document details the recommended implementation of a VMware 
virtualization architecture based on specific business requirements and VMware 
recommended practices. The document provides both logical and physical design 
considerations for all related infrastructure components including servers, storage, 
networking, management, and virtual machines.
The scope of this document is specific to the design of the virtual infrastructure and 
the supporting components.
The purpose and overview section should also include details of the design methodology the 
architect has used in creating the architecture design. This should include the processes 
followed to determine the business and technical requirements along with definitions of the 
infrastructure qualities that influenced the design decisions.

The Design Documentation
218
Design factors, requirements, constraints, and assumptions are documented as part of the 
conceptual design. Chapter 3, The Design Factors provides details on the key factors included 
as part of the conceptual design. To document the design factors, use a table to organize 
them and associate them with an ID that can be easily referenced.
The following table illustrates an example of how to document the design requirements:
ID
Requirement
R001
Consolidate the existing 100 physical application servers down to five servers
R002
Provide capacity to support growth for 25 additional application servers over the 
next five years
R003
Server hardware maintenance should not affect application uptime
R004
Provide N+2 redundancy to support a hardware failure during normal and 
maintenance operations
The conceptual design should also include tables documenting any constraints and 
assumptions. A high-level diagram of the conceptual design can also be included.
Details of the logical design are documented in the architecture design document. The 
logical design of management, storage, network, and compute resources should be included. 
When documenting the logical design document, any recommended practices that were 
followed should be included. Also include references to the requirements, constraints, and 
assumptions that influenced the design decisions.
When documenting the logical design, show your work to support 
your design decisions. Include any formulas used for resource 
calculations and provide detailed explanations of why design 
decisions were made.
An example table outlining the logical design of compute resource requirements is as follows:
Parameter
Specification
Current CPU resources required
100 GHz
*CPU growth
25 GHz
CPU required (75 percent utilization)
157 GHz
Current memory resources required
525 GB
*Memory growth
131 GB
Memory required (75 percent utilization)
821 GB
Memory required (25 percent TPS savings)
616 GB
*CPU and memory growth of 25 additional application servers (R002)

Chapter 11
219
Similar tables will be created to document the logical design for storage, network, and 
management resources.
The physical design documents have the details of the physical hardware chosen along with 
the configurations of both the physical and virtual hardware. Details of vendors and hardware 
models chosen and the reasons for decisions made should be included as part of the physical 
design.  The configuration of the physical hardware is documented along with the details 
of why specific configuration options were chosen. The physical design should also include 
diagrams that document the configuration of physical resources, such as physical network 
connectivity and storage layout.
A sample outline of the architecture design document is as follows:

Writing an implementation plan
The implementation plan documents the requirements necessary to complete the 
implementation of the design.
The implementation plan defines the project roles and defines what is expected of the 
customer and what they can expect during the implementation of the design.
This document is sometimes referred to as the statement of work. It defines the  
key points of contact, the requirements that must be satisfied to start the implementation, 
any project documentation deliverables, and how changes to the design and implementation 
will be handled.

How it works...
The purpose statement defines the purpose and scope of the document. The purpose 
statement of the implementation plan should define what is included in the document  
and provide a brief overview of the goals of the project. The purpose statement is simply an 
introduction so that someone reading the document can gain a quick understanding of what 
the document contains.
The following is an example purpose statement:
This document serves as the implementation plan and defines the scope of the 
virtualization project. This document identifies points of contact for the project, lists 
implementation requirements, provides a brief description of each of the document 
deliverables, deliverables, and provides an overview of the implementation process 
for the data-center virtualization project.
The scope of this document is specific to the implementation of the virtual  
data-center implementation and the supporting components as defined in  
the Architecture Design.
Key project contacts, their roles, and their contact information should be included as part of 
the implementation plan document. These contacts include customer stakeholders, project 
managers, project architects, and implementation engineers.

Chapter 11

The following is a sample table that can be used to document project contacts for the 
implementation plan:
Role

QA engineer
Support contacts for hardware and software used in the implementation plan may also  
be included in the table, for example, contact numbers for VMware support or other  
vendor support.
Implementation requirements contain the implementation dependencies to include the 
access and facility requirements. Any hardware, software, and licensing that must be  
available to implement the design is also documented here.
Access requirements include the following:
f
f
Physical access to the site.
f
f
Credentials necessary for access to resources. These include active directory 
credentials and VPN credentials (if remote access is required).
Facility requirements include the following:

The Design Documentation
222
A high-level overview of the steps required to complete the implementation is also 
documented. The details of each step are not a part of this document; only the steps  
that need to be performed will be included. For example:
1.	 Procurement of hardware, software, and licensing.
2.	 Scheduling of engineering resources.
3.	 Verification of access and facility requirements.
4.	 Performance of an inventory check for the required hardware, software, and licensing.
5.	 Installation and configuration of storage array.
6.	 Rack, cable, and burn-in of physical server hardware.
7.	
Installation of ESXi on physical servers.
8.	 Installation of vCenter Server.
9.	 Configuration of ESXi and vCenter.
10.	 Testing and verification of implementation plan.
11.	 Migration of physical workloads to virtual machines.
12.	Operational verification of the implementation plan.
The implementation overview may also include an implementation timeline documenting the 
time required to complete each of the steps.
Project documentation deliverables are defined as part of the implementation plan. Any 
documentation that will be delivered to the customer once the implementation has been 
completed should be detailed here. Details include the name of the document and a brief 
description of the purpose of the document.
The following table provides example descriptions of the project documentation deliverables:

the installation to verify whether or not the infrastructure continues 
to function correctly.
Operational procedures
This document provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to 
perform common operational tasks after the design is implemented.
How changes are made to the design, specifically changes made to the design factors, must 
be well documented. Even a simple change to a requirement or an assumption that cannot 
be verified can have a tremendous effect on the design and implementation. The process for 
submitting a change, researching the impact of the change, and approving the change should 
be documented in detail.

Developing an installation guide
The installation guide provides step-by-step instructions for the implementation of the 
architecture design. This guide should include detailed information about how to implement 
and configure all the resources associated with the virtual datacenter project.

The Design Documentation
224
In many projects, the person creating the design is not the person responsible for 
implementing the design. The installation guide outlines the steps necessary to  
implement the physical design outlined in the architecture design document.
The installation guide should provide details about the installation of all components, 
including the storage and network configurations required to support the design. In a complex 
design, multiple installation guides may be created to document the installation of the various 
components required to support the design. For example, separate installation guides may be 
created for the storage, network, and vSphere installation and configuration.
How to do it...
The installation guide should include the following information:
f
f
Purpose statement
f
f
Assumption statement
f
f
Step-by-step instructions to implement the design
How it works...
The purpose statement simply states the purpose of the document. The assumption 
statement describes any assumptions the document's author has made. Commonly, an 
assumption statement simply states that the document has been written, assuming that the 
reader is familiar with virtualization concepts and the architecture design.
The following is an example of a basic purpose and assumption statement that can be used 
for an installation guide:
Purpose: This document provides a guide for installing and configuring the virtual 
infrastructure design defined in the Architecture Design.
Assumptions: This guide is written for an implementation engineer or administrator 
who is familiar with vSphere concepts and terminologies. The guide is not intended 
for administrators who have no prior knowledge of vSphere concepts and terminology.
The installation guide should include details on implementing all areas of the design. It should 
include configuration of the storage array, physical servers, physical network components, and 
vSphere components. The following are just a few examples of installation tasks to include 
instructions for:
f

The validation test plan documents how the implementation will be verified. It documents 
the criteria that must be met to determine the success of the implementation and the 
test procedures that should be followed when validating the environment. The criteria 
and procedures defined in the validation test plan determine whether or not the design 
requirements have been successfully met.
How to do it...
The validation test plan should include the following information:
f
f
Purpose statement
f
f
Assumption statement
f
f
Success criteria
f
f
Test procedures
How it works...
The purpose statement defines the purpose of the validation test plan and the assumption 
statement documents any assumptions the author of the plan has made in developing the 
test plan. Typically, the assumptions are that the testing and validation will be performed by 
someone who is familiar with the concepts and the design.
The following is an example of a purpose and assumption statement for a validation test plan:
Purpose: This document contains testing procedures to verify that the implemented 
configurations specified in the Architecture Design document successfully 
addresses the customer requirements.
Assumptions: This document assumes that the person performing these tests has 
a basic understanding of VMware vSphere and is familiar with the accompanying 
design documentation. This document is not intended for administrators or testers 
who have no prior knowledge of vSphere concepts and terminology.

Chapter 11
227
The success criteria determines whether or not the implemented design is operating  
as expected. More importantly, these criteria determine whether or not the design 
requirements have been met. Success is measured based on whether or not the  
criteria satisfies the design requirements.
The following  table shows some examples of success criteria defined in the validation  
test plan:
Description
Measurement
Members of the active directory group vSphere administrators are able to 
access vCenter as administrators
Yes/No
Access is denied to users outside the vSphere administrators active 
directory group
Yes/No
Access to a host using the vSphere Client is permitted when lockdown mode 
is disabled
Yes/No
Access to a host using the vSphere Client is denied when lockdown mode is 
enabled
Yes/No
Cluster resource utilization is less than 75 percent.
Yes/No
If the success criteria are not met, the design does not satisfy the design factors. This can 
be due to a misconfiguration or error in the design. Troubleshooting will need to be done to 
identify the issue or modifications to the design may need to be made.
Test procedures are performed to determine whether or not the success criteria have been 
met. Test procedures should include testing of usability, performance, and recoverability. 
Test procedures should include the test description, the tasks to perform the test, and the 
expected results of the test.
The following table provides some examples of usability testing procedures:
Test description
Tasks to perform test
Expected result
vCenter administrator 
access
Use the vSphere Web Client to access 
the vCenter Server. Log in as a user 
who is a member of the vSphere 
administrators AD group.
Administrator access to the 
inventory of the vCenter 
Server
vCenter access: No 
permissions
Use the vSphere Web Client to access 
the vCenter Server. Log in as a user 
who is not a member of the vSphere 
administrators AD group.
Access is denied
Host access: lockdown 
mode disabled
Disable lockdown mode through 
the DCUI. Use the vSphere Client to 
access the host and log in as root.
Direct access to the host 
using the vSphere Client is 
successful

Test description
Tasks to perform test
Expected result
Host access: lockdown 
mode enabled
Re-enable lockdown mode through 
the DCUI. Use the vSphere Client to 
access the host and log in as root.
Direct access to the host 
using the vSphere Client is 
denied
The following table provides some examples of reliability testing procedures:
Test description
Tasks to perform test
Expected result
Host storage path 
failure 
Disconnect a vmnic providing 
IP storage connectivity from the 
host
The disconnected path fails, but 
I/O continues to be processed 
on the surviving paths. A network 
connectivity alarm should be 
triggered and an e-mail should 
be sent to the configured e-mail 
address.
Host storage path 
restore
Reconnect the vmnic providing IP 
storage connectivity
The failed path should become 
active and begin processing the 
I/O. Network connectivity alarms 
should clear.
Array storage path 
failure
Disconnect one network 
connection from the active SP
The disconnected paths fail on 
all hosts, but I/O continues to 
be processed on the surviving 
paths.
Management network 
redundancy
Disconnect the active 
management network vmnic
The stand-by adapter becomes 
active. Management access 
to the host is not interrupted. 
A loss-of-network redundancy 
alarm should be triggered and 
an e-mail should be sent to the 
configured e-mail address.
These are just a few examples of test procedures. The actual test procedures will depend on 
the requirements defined in the conceptual design.

Writing operational procedures
The operational-procedure document provides the detailed, step-by-step procedures required 
for the successful operation of the implemented virtual data-center design. These procedures 
should include monitoring and troubleshooting, virtual machine deployment, environment 
startup and shutdown, patching and updating, and any other details that may be required for 
the successful operation of the implemented design.
How to do it...
The operational procedures should include the following information:
f
f
Purpose statement
f
f
Assumption statement
f
f
Step-by-step procedure for daily operations
f
f
Troubleshooting and recovery procedures
How it works...
As with other design documents, the purpose statement defines the purpose of the 
operational-procedures document. The assumption statement details any assumptions the 
author of the plan made in developing the procedures.
Purpose: This document contains detailed step-by-step instructions on how to 
perform common operational tasks. This document provides a guide to performing 
common tasks associated with management, monitoring, troubleshooting, virtual 
machine deployment, updating, and recovery.
Assumptions: This document assumes that an administrator who uses these 
procedures is familiar with VMware vSphere concepts and terminology.

The Design Documentation
230
The operational procedure document provides step-by-step procedures for common tasks that 
will need to be performed by the administrator of the environment. Examples of procedures to 
include are as follows:
f
f
Accessing the environment
f
f
Monitoring resource usage and performance
f
f
Deploying new virtual machines
f
f
Patching ESXi hosts
f
f
Updating VMware tools and virtual-machine hardware
The operational procedure document should also describe troubleshooting and recovery. 
Examples of these procedures include the following:
f
f
Monitoring alarms
f
f
Exporting log bundles
f
f
Restoring a virtual machine from a backup
f
f
Environment shutdown and startup
The following screenshot is an example taken from an operational-procedures document that

Presenting the design
Typically, once the design has been completed, it is presented to the customer for approval 
before implementation.
In order to obtain customer approval, typically, a high-level presentation is given to the project 
stakeholders to provide details on how the design satisfies the requirements and the benefits 
associated with the design.
If you are not comfortable giving presentations, check out 
http://www.toastmasters.org/. Toastmasters can 
help you develop presentation skills and build confidence when 
speaking in front of people.

The Design Documentation
232
How to do it...
Presenting the design to stakeholders is a simple, but important, part of the design process:
1.	 Develop a presentation.
2.	 Present the design to the customer.
How it works...
The presentation should include the following information:
f
f
An overview of the design methodology
f
f
An overview of the discovery process
f
f
The design factors: requirements, constraints, and assumptions
f
f
A high-level overview of the logical and physical design
Remember to tailor your presentation to your audience. Keep the presentation at a high level, 
but be ready to provide details about the technical and business decisions made to support 
the design.
When presenting the design, explain the key design decisions and how they satisfy  
the requirements. Cover the entire design, but keep the presentation brief. Be ready  
to answer questions about the design and the reasons behind the design decisions.
Implementing the design
The final step of the design process is the implementation of the design.
Implementation takes the design from paper and puts it into practice. If time has been taken 
to create and correctly document a solid design, its implementation will be the easiest part of 
the process.

Chapter 11
233
How to do it...
The following steps are part of the design implementation:
1.	 Implementation of the documented design.
2.	 Validation and testing.
3.	 Review and delivery.
How it works...
Implement the design as documented in the architecture design. The implementation plan 
provides a guide to the implementation process, while the installation guide provides the 
details about performing the installation. The validation test plan is then used to test and 
validate the implementation against the design requirements.
Once the design has been successfully implemented, the design should be reviewed with the 
customer to identify any lessons learned for next steps. The documented deliverables are then 
provided to the customer.
Good luck.
