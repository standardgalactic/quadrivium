CHAPTER 1
STRAIGHT LINES
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:
1. Calculate the distance between two points.
2. Locate a point by dividing a line segment.
3. Define the inclination of a line and determine the line's slope.
4. Solve for the slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines.
5. Compute the angle between two lines.
6. Determine the equation of a straight line using the point-slope
form, the slope-intercept form, and the normal form.
7. Determine the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.
8. Calculate the distance from a point to a line.
INTRODUCTION
The study of straight lines provides an excellent introduction
to analytic geometry. As its name implies, this branch of
mathematics
is
concerned
with
geometrical
relationships.
However, in contrast to plane and solid geometry, the study of
these relationships in analytic geometry is accomplished by
algebraic analysis.
The invention of the rectangular coordinate system made
algebraic analysis of geometrical relationships possible. Rene
Descartes, a French mathematician, is credited with this inven-
tion; the coordinate system is often designated as the Cartesian
coordinate system in his honor.
1-1

You should recall our study of the rectangular coordinate
system in Mathematics, Volume 1, NAVEDTRA 10069-Dl, in
which we reviewed the following definitions and terms:
t---+----+~::+----+--I---+ x

1. The values of x along, or parallel to, the X axis
are abscissas. They are positive if measured to the right
of the origin; they are negative if measured to the left
of the origin. (See fig. 1-1.)
2. The values of y along, or parallel to, the Yaxis
are ordinates. They are positive if measured above the
origin; they are negative if measured below the origin.
3. The abscissa and ordinate of a point are its
coordinates.

• P(3.-2)
Any point on the coordinate system is designated by
naming its abscissa and ordinate. For example, the
abscissa of point P (fig. 1-1) is 3 and the ordinate is
- 2. Therefore, the symbolic notation for P is
Figure
I-I.-Rectangular
coordinate
system.
In using this symbol to designate a point, the abscissa is always
written first, followed by a comma. The ordinate is written last.
The general form of the symbol is
P(x,y)
DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS
The distance between two points, PI and Ph can
be expresssed in terms of their coordinates by using
the Pythagorean theorem. From your study of
Mathematics, Volume 1, you should recall that this
theorem is stated as follows:
In a right triangle, the square ofthe length ofthe
hypotenuse (longest side) is equal to the sum of the
squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
Let the coordinates of PI be (XhY.) and let those
of P2 be (XhY2), as shown in figure 1-2. By the
Pythagorean theorem,

where PIN represents the distance between XI and X2, P2N
represents the distance between YI and Y2, and d represents the
distance from PI to P2. We can express the length of PINin terms
of XI and X2 and the length of P~interms ofYI andY2 as follows:
d = V(X2 - XI)2 + 0'2 - YI)2
Although we have demonstrated the formula for the first quadrant
only, it can be proven for all quadrants and all pairs of points.
EXAMPLE: In figure 1-2, XI = 2, X2 = 6, YI = 2, and Y2 = 5.
Find the length of d.

By similar reasoning,
The X and y found as a result of the foregoing discussion are
the coordinates of the desired point, whose distances from PI and

INCLINATION AND SLOPE

~-----+-_L...-__ X
The angle a/inclination, denoted by the Greek let-
y
ter alpha (a), as portrayed in figure 1-4, views A and
B, is the angle formed by the line crossing the X axis
and the positively directed portion of the X axis, such
that 0 0 < a < 180 o.
The slope of any line is equal to the tangent of its
angle of inclination. Slope is denoted by the letter m.
Therefore,
m = tan a
Designating the coordinates of PI as (XltYI) and those
of P2 as (XhY2), we recall that
If the axes are in their conventional positions, a line,
such as AB in figure 1-4, view A, that slopes upward
and to the right will have a positive slope. A line, such
as CD in figure 1-4, view B, that slopes downward and
to the right will have a negative slope.
Since the tangent of a is the ratio of P2M to PIM,
we can relate the slope of line AB to the points PI and
P 2 as follows:
Figure 1-4.-Aogles of ioclioatioo.
so that
The quantities (X2 - XI) and (Y2 - Yd represent changes that
occur in the values of the X and Y coordinates as a result of the
change from P2 to PIon line AB. The symbol used by mathemati-
cians to represent an increment of change is the Greek letter delta
(A). Therefore, Ax means "the change in x" and Ay means "the
change in y." The amount of change in the x coordinate, as we
change from P2 to PI' is X2 - XI. Therefore,
1-6

and likewise,
Ay = Y2 - YI
We use this notation to express the slope of line AB as follows:
m - Ay
-Ax
EXAMPLE: Find the slope of the line connecting P 2(7 ,6) and
P I ( -1, -4).
SOLUTION:
Ay = Y2 - YI = 6 - ( - 4) = 10
Ax = X2 -
XI = 7 - ( - 1) = 8
Step (1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Note that the choice of labels for PI and P2 is strictly arbitrary.
In the previous example, if we had chosen the point (7,6) to be
PI and the point ( - 1, - 4) to be P 2 , the following results would
have occurred:
Ay = Y2 - YI = - 4 - 6 = -10
Ax = X2 -
XI = -1 - 7 = - 8
Step (1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Notice that this solution yields the same result as the last example.
A slope of 5/4 means that a point moving along this line would
move vertically +5 units for every horizontal movement of + 4
units. This result is consistent with our definition of positive slope;
that is, sloping upward and to the right.
If line AB in figure 1-4, view A, was parallel to the
X
axis,
YI
and
Y2
would
be equal
and
the
difference

1-7

We conclude that the slope of a horizontal line is O. We can also
reach this conclusion by noting that angle a (fig. 1-4, view A) is
0° when the line is parallel to the X axis. Since the tangent of 0 °
is 0, then
m = tan 0° = 0
The slope of a line that is parallel to the Yaxis becomes mean-
ingless. The tangent of the angle a increases indefinitely as a
approaches 90°. We sometimes say that m-oo (m approaches in-
finity) when a approaches 90 0.
SLOPES OF PARALLEL AND
PERPENDICULAR LINES
If two lines are parallel,
their slopes must
be equal.
Each line
will
cut
the
X
axis
at
the
same
angle
a
so
that if
m 1 = tan a and m 2 = tan a
then
We conclude that two
lines
which are
parallel have the
same slope.
Suppose that two lines are perpendicular to
each other, as lines L 1 and L 2 in figure 1-5. The
slope and angle of inclination of L 1 are m 1 and ai,
respectively. The slope and angle of inclination of
L 2 are m2 and ah respectively. Then the following
is true:
y
ml = tan al
m2 = tan a2
Although not shown here, the fact that a2 (fig.

cally. Because of this relationship

We conclude that if two lines are perpendicular,
the slope of one is the negative reciprocal of the slope
of the other. Conversely, if the slopes of two lines
are negative reciprocals of each other, the lines are
perpendicular.
EXAMPLE: In figure 1-6 show that line L 1 is
perpendicular to line L 2 • Line L 1 passes through
points P 1(O,5) and P 2( - 1,3). Line L 2 passes through
points P 2( -1,3) and P 3(3,1).

ANGLE BETWEEN TWO LINES
When two lines intersect, the angle between
them is defined as the angle through which one of
the lines must be rotated to make it coincide with
the other line. For example, the angle ~ (the Greek
letter phi) in figure 1-7 is the acute angle between
lines L 1 and L 2 •
Referring to figure 1-7,
We will determine the value of ~ directly from
the slopes of lines L 1 and L h as follows:
_
tan 0'2 - tan 0'1
- 1 + tan 0'1 tan 0'2
Figure 1-7.-Angle between two lines.
We obtain this result by using the trigonometric identity for the
tangent of the difference between two angles. Trigonometric iden-
tities are discussed in chapter 6 of Mathematics, Volume 2-A,
NAVEDTRA 10062.

Recalling that the tangent of the angle of inclination is the slope
of the line, we have
such that
Substituting these expressions in the tangent formula derived in
the above discussion, we have

subtract the acute angle between L 1 and L 2 from 180°. Referring
to figure 1-7,
1-11

If the obtuse angle in the previous example was to be found,
then
f = 180° - 36° 52'
=143°8'
If one of the lines was parallel to the Yaxis, its slope would
be infinite. This would render the slope formula for tan ~ useless,
because an infinite value in both the numerator and denominator
of the fraction
Im~ - ml
produces an indeterminate form.

However, if only one of the lines is known to be parallel to the
Y axis, the tangent of ~ may be expressed by another method.
Suppose that L 2 (fig 1-7) was parallel to the Yaxis. Then we
would have

If L 1 has a positive slope, then the acute angle between L. and

EQUATION OF A STRAIGHT LINE
In Mathematics, Volume 1, equations such as
2x+y=6
are designated as linear equations, and their graphs are shown to
be straight lines. The purpose of this discussion is to study the
relationship of slope to the equation of a straight line.
POINT-SLOPE FORM
Suppose that we want to find the equation of a straight line
that passes through a known point and has a known slope. Let
(x,Y) represent the coordinates of any point on the line, and let
(Xt,YI) represent the coordinates of the known point. The slope
is represented by m.
Recalling the formula defining slope in terms of the coordinates
of two points, we have
m =Y - Yl
X-Xl
1-13

EXAMPLE: Find the equation of a line passing through the
point (2,3) and having a slope of 3.
SOLUTION:
Step (1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Xl = 2 and Yl = 3
Y - YI = m(x - Xl)
:. Y - 3 = 3(x - 2)
Y - 3 = 3x - 6
or Y - 3x = -3
The point-slope form may be used to find the equation of a
line through two known points. The values of Xl, X2, Yl, and Y2
are first used to find the slope of the line; then either known point
is used with the slope in the point-slope form.
EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the line through the points
( - 3,4) and (4, - 2).
SOLUTION:
Step (1)
-2-4
-6
= 4+3 =T
(2)
Letting (x,y) represent any point on the line and using ( - 3,4) as
a known point, we have
-6
Y - 4 = T[x - ( - 3)]
7(y - 4) =
- 6(x + 3)
7y - 28 = - 6x - 18
7y + 6x = 10
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
Using (4, - 2) as the known point will also give 7y + 6x = 10 as
the linear equation.
SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM
Any line that is not parallel to the Yaxis intersects the Yaxis
at some point. The X coordinate of the point of intersection is
0, because the Yaxis is vertical and passes through the origin.
Let the y coordinate of the point of intersection be represented
1-14

by b. Then the point of intersection is (O,b), as shown
in figure 1-8. The y coordinate, b, is called the y
intercept.
The slope of the line in figure 1-8 is ~.
The value of Ay in this expression is y - b, where y
represents the y coordinate of any point on the line.
The value of Ax is x - °= x, so
Ay
y:- b
m=Ax=-x-
mx =y - b
y = mx+ b
This is the standard slope-intercept form of a straight

NORMAL FORM
Methods for determining the equation of a line usually depend
upon some knowledge of a point or points on the line. Let's now
consider a method that does not require advance knowledge con-
cerning any of the line's points. All that is known about the line
is its perpendicular distance from the origin and the angle
between the perpendicular and the X axis, where the angle is
measured counterclockwise from the positive side of the X axis.
In figure 1-9, line AB is a distance p away from the origin,
and line OM forms an angle e (the Greek letter theta) with the
X axis. We select any point P(x,y) on line AB and develop the

equation of line AB in terms of the x and y of P. Since P represents
ANY point on the line, the x and y of the equation will represent
EVERY point on the line and therefore will represent the line itself.
PR is constructed perpendicular to OB at point R. NR is drawn
parallel to AB, and PN is parallel to OB. PS is perpendicular to
NR and to AB. A right angle is formed by angles NRO and PRN.
Triangles ONR and OMB are similar right triangles. Therefore,
angles NRO and MBO are equal and are designated as 8'. Since
8 + 8' = 90
0 in triangle OMB and angle NRO is equal to 8', then
angle PRN equals 8. Finally, the x distance of point P is equal
to OR, and the y distance of P is equal to PR.
To relate the distance p to x and y, we reason as follows:
ON = (OR) (cos 8)
= x cos 8
PS = (PR) (sin 8)
= y sin 8
OM= ON+PS
p = ON+ PS
p = x cos 8 + y sin 8
This final equation is the normal form. The word "normal" in
this usage refers to the perpendicular relationship between OM
and AB.
"Normal"
frequently means
"perpendicular" in
mathematical and scientific usage. The distance p is always con-
sidered to be positive, and 8 is any angle between 0
0 and 360
0

EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the line that is 5 units away
from the origin, if the perpendicular from the line to the origin
forms an angle of 30
0 from the positive side of the X axis.
SOLUTION:
p = 5; 8 = 30

p = x cos 8 + y sin 8

PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES
The general equation of a straight line is often written with
capital letters for coefficients t as follows:
Ax + By + C = 0
These literal coefficients t as they are called t represent the numerical
coefficients encountered in a typical linear equation.
Suppose we are given two equations that are duplicates except
for the constant term t as follows:
Ax + By + C = 0
Ax + By + D = 0
By placing these two equations in slope-intercept form t we can
show that their slopes are equal t as follows:
y = ~ ~)x + (- ~)
y = ~ ~)x + (- ~)
Thus t the slope of each line is - AlB.
Since lines having equal slopes are parallel t we reach the follow-
ing conclusion: In any two linear equations, if the coefficients of
the x and y terms are identical in value and sign, then the lines
represented by these equations are parallel.
EXAMPLE:
Write the equation of a line parallel to
3x - y - 2 = 0 and passing through the point (5 t 2).
SOLUTION: The coefficients of x and y in the desired equa-
tion are the same as those in the given equation. Therefore t the
equation is
3x - y + D = 0
Since the line passes through (5t2)t the values x = 5 and y = 2 must
satisfy the equation. Substituting these t we have
3(5) - (2) + D = 0
D = -13
1-18

Thus, the required equation is
3x - y - 13 = 0
A situation similar to that prevailing with parallel lines involves
perpendicular lines. For example, consider the equations
Ax+ By + C = 0
Bx - Ay + D = 0
Transposing these equations into the slope-intercept form, we have
y = (- ~)x + (- ~)
y = (~)x+(~)
Since the slopes of these two lines are negative reciprocals, the
lines are perpendicular.
The
conclusion
derived
from
the
foregoing
discussion
is as follows: If a line is to be perpendicular to a given
line, the coefficients of x and y in the required equation
are found by interchanging the coefficients of x and y
in the given equation and changing the sign of one of
them.
EXAMPLE: Write the equation of a line perpendicular to the
line x + 3y + 3 = 0 and having a y intercept of 5.
SOLUTION: The required equation is
3x - y + D = 0
Notice the interchange of coefficients and the change of sign. At
the point where the line crosses the Yaxis, the value of x is 0 and
the value of y is 5. Therefore, the equation is
3(0) - (5) + D = 0
D = 5
The required equation is
3x - y + 5 = 0

3. x - y = -5
DISTANCE FROM A POINT
TO A LINE
We must often express the distance from a point to a line in
terms of the c0dficients in the equation of the line. To do this,
we compare the two forms of the equation of a straight line, as
follows:
General equation: Ax + By + C = 0
Normal form: x cos B+ y sin B- p = 0
The general equation and the normal form represent the same
straight line. Therefore, A (the coefficient of x in the general form)
is proportional to cos B(the coefficient of x in the normal form).
By similar reasoning, B is proportional to sin B, and C is propor-
tional to - p. Recalling that quantities proportional to each other
1-20

form ratios involving a constant of proportionality, let k be this
constant. Thus, we have
cos 8 - k
A
-
sin 8 - k
B
-
cos 8 = kA
sin 8 = kB
Squaring both sides of these two expressions and then adding,
we have
k 2 _
1
- A 2 + B 2
The coefficients in the normal form, ex-
pressed in terms of A, B, and C, are as
follows:
C
-p = ±V A 2 + B2
The sign of VA 2 + B 2 is chosen so as to
make p (a distance) always positive.
The conversion formulas developed in the
foregoing discussion are used in finding the
distance from a point to a line. Let p
represent the distance of line LK from the
origin. (See fig. 1-10.) To find d, the distance
from point PI to line LK, we construct a line
1-21
y
Figure I-IO.-Distance from a point to a line.

through PI parallel to LK. The distance of this line from the origin
is OS, and the difference between OS and p is d.
We obtain an expression for d, based on the coordinates of
PI' as follows:
OS = XI cos a + YI sin a
and
d = OS - p
= X I cos a + Y I sin a- p
Returning to the expressions for sin a, cos a, and -p in terms of
A, B, and C (the coefficients in the general equation), we have
In the formula for d, the denominator in each of the expressions
is the same. Therefore, we may combine terms as follows:
d =
xlA + y1B + C
VA 2 + 8 2
We use the absolute value, since d is a distance, and thus avoid
any confusion arising from the ± radical.
Note that the absolute value, I I' of a number is defined as
follows:
Ib I= b for b > 0
and
Ib 1= - b for b < 0
That is, for the positive number 2,

Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:

equation.

versa.
Figure 2-1.-Conic sections.
INTRODUCTION
This chapter is a continuation of the study of
analytic geometry. The figures presented in this
chapter are plane figures, which are included in the
general class of conic sections or simply "conics."
Conic sections are so named because they are all
plane sections of a right circular cone. A circle is
formed when a cone is cut perpendicular to its axis.
An ellipse is produced when the cone is cut obliquely
to the axis and the surface. A hyperbola results when
the cone is intersected by a plane parallel to the axis,
and a parabola results when the intersecting plane
is parallel to an element of the surface. These are
illustrated in figure 2-1.
When such a curve is plotted on a coordinate
system, it may be defined as follows:
A conic section is the locus of all points in a plane
whose distance from a fixed point is a constant ratio
to its distance from a fixed line. The fixed point is
the focus, and the fixed line is the directrix.
2-1
CIRCL.E
HYPERBOL.A
EL.L.IPSE
PARABOL.A

The ratio referred to in the definition is called the eccentricity
(e). If the eccentricity is greater than 0 and less than 1, the curve
is an ellipse. If e is greater than 1, the curve is a hyperbola. If
e is equal to 1, the curve is a parabola. A circle is a special case
having an eccentricity equal to O. It is actually a limiting case of
an ellipse in which the eccentricity approaches O. Thus, if
0< e < 1, it is an ellipse;
e > 1, it is a hyperbola;
e = 1, it is a parabola;
e = 0, it is a circle.
The eccentricity, focus, and directrix are used in the algebraic
analysis of conic sections and their corresponding equations. The
concept of the locus of an equation also enters into analytic
geometry; this concept is discussed before the individual conic
sections are presented.
THE LOCUS OF AN EQUATION
In chapter 1 of this course, methods for analysis of linear
equations are presented. If a group of x and y values [or ordered
pairs, P(x,y)] that satisfy a given linear equation are plotted on
a coordinate system, the resulting graph is a straight line.
When higher-ordered equations such as
X2 + y2 = 1 or y = V2x + 3
are encountered, the resulting graph is not a straight line.
However, the points whose coordinates satisfy most of the equa-
tions in x and yare normally not scattered in a random field. If
the values are plotted, they will seem to follow a line or curve (or a
combination of lines and curves). In many texts the plot of an
equation is called a curve, even when it is a straight line. This curve
is called the locus of the equation. The locus of an equation is
a curve containing those points, and only those points, whose
coordinates satisfy the equation.
At times the curve may be defined by a set of conditions rather
than by an equation, though an equation may be derived from
the given conditions. Then the curve in question would be the locus
of all points that fit the conditions. For instance a circle may be
said to be the locus of all points in a plane that is a fixed distance
from a fixed point. A straight line may be defined as the locus
2-2

of all points in a plane equidistant from two fixed points.
The method of expressing a set of conditions in analytical
form gives an equation. Let us draw up a set of
conditions and translate them into an equation.
EXAMPLE: What is the equation of the curve that
is the locus of all points equidistant from the two points
(5,3) and (2,1)?
SOLUTION: First, as shown in figure 2-2, choose
some point having coordinates (x,y). Recall from chapter
1 of this course that the distance between this point and
(2,1) is given by
V(x -
2)2 + (y -
1)2
The distance between point (x,y) and (5,3) is given by
V(x -
5)2 + (y -
3)2

Figure 2-2.-Locus of points equidis-
tant from two given points.
Equating these distances, since the point is to be equidistant from
the two given points, we have
V(x - 2)2 + (y -
1)2 = V(x -
5)2 + (y -
3)2
Squaring both sides, we have
(x - 2)2 + (y -
1)2 = (x - 5)2 + (y - 3)2
Expanding, we have
x 2 - 4x + 4 + y2 - 2y + 1
= X2 -
lOx + 25 + y2 - 6y + 9
Canceling and collecting terms, we see that
4y + 5 = - 6x + 34
4y = -6x + 29
y = -1.5x + 7.25
This is the equation of a straight line with a slope of minus 1.5
and a y intercept of + 7.25.
2-3

EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the curve that
is the locus of all points equidistant from the line
x = - 3 and the point (3,0).
SOLUTION: As shown in figure 2-3, the distance
from the point (x,y) on the curve to the line x =
- 3
IS
V[x - (- 3»)2 + (y - y)2 = V(x + 3)2
The distance from the point (x,y) to the point (3,0) is
V(x - 3)2 + (y - 0)2
Equating the two distances yields
Squaring and expanding both sides yields
x 2 + 6x + 9 = x 2 - 6x + 9 + y2
Canceling and collecting terms yields
y2 = 12x
which is the equation of a parabola.

THE CIRCLE
A circle is the locus of all points, in a plane that
is a fixed distance from a fixed point, called the
center.
The fixed distance spoken of here is the radius
of the circle.
The equation of a circle with its center at the
origin (fig. 2-5) is
V(x - 0)2 + (y - 0)2 = r
where (x,y) is a point on the circle and r is the radius
(r replaces d in the standard distance formula). Then
or
(2.1)
If the center of a circle, figure 2-6, is at some
point where x = h, y = k, then the distance of the
point (x,y) from the center will be constant and equal
to
v(x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r
or
(x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r 2

Equations (2.1) and (2.2) are the standard forms for the equation
of a circle. Equation (2.1) is merely a special case of equation (2.2)
in which hand k are equal to zero.
The equation of a circle may also be expressed in the general
form:
x2+ y2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0
where B, C, and D are constants.
(2.3)
Theorem: An equation of the second degree in which the
coefficients of the x2 and y2 terms are equal and the xy term
does not exist, represents a circle.
Whenever we find an equation in the form of equation
(2.3), we should convert it to the form of equation (2.2) so
that we have the coordinates of the center of the circle and
the radius as part of the equation. This may be done as shown
in the following example problems:
EXAMPLE: Find the coordinates of the center and the
radius of the circle described by the following equation:
x2+ y2 - 4x - 6y - 3 = 0
SOLUTION: First rearrange the terms
x2 - 4x + y2 - 6y - 3 = 0
and complete the square in both x and y. Completing the square
is discussed in the chapter on quadratic solutions in Mathematics,
Volume 1. The procedure consists basically of adding certain
quantities to both sides of a second-degree equation to form the
sum of two perfect squares. When both the first- and second-
degree members are known, the square of one-half the coefficient
of the first-degree term is added to both sides of the equation.
This will allow the quadratic equation to be factored into the sum
of two perfect squares. To complete the square in x in the given
equation
x2- 4x + y2 - 6y - 3 = 0
2-7

add the square of one-half the coefficient of x to both sides of
the equation
r - 4x + (2)2 + y2 - 6y - 3 = 0 + (2)2
then
(r - 4x + 4) + y2 - 6y - 3 = 4
(x - 2)2 + y2 - 6y - 3 = 4
completes the square in x.
If we do the same for y,
(x - 2)2 + y2 - 6y + (3)2 - 3 = 4 + (3)2
(x - 2)2 + (y2 - 6y + 9) - 3 = 4 + 9
(x - 2)2 + (y - 3)2 - 3 = 4 + 9
completes the square in y.
Transpose all constant terms to the right-hand side and
simplify:
(x - 2)2 + (y - 3)2 = 4 + 9 + 3
(x - 2)2 + (y - 3)2 = 16
The equation is now in the standard form of equation (2.2). This
equation represents a circle with the center at (2,3) and with a
radius equal to VT6 or 4.
EXAMPLE: Find the coordinates of the center and the radius

In certain situations you will want to consider the following
general form of a circle
x2 + y2 + Bx + Cy + D =°
as the equation of a circle in which the specific values of the
constants B, C, and D are to be determined. In this problem the
unknowns to be found are not x and y, but the values of the
constants B, C, and D. The conditions that define the circle are
used to form algebraic relationships between these constants. For
example, if one of the conditions imposed on the circle is that
it pass through the point (3,4), then the general form is written
with x and y replaced by 3 and 4, respectively; thus,
x2 + y2 + Bx + Cy + D = °
is rewritten as
(3)2 + (4)2 + B(3) + C(4) + D
= °
3B + 4C + D = - 25
Three independent constants (B, C, and D) are in the
equation of a circle; therefore, three conditions must be given to
define a circle. Each of these conditions will yield an equation
with B, C, and D as the unknowns. These three equations are then
solved simultaneously to determine the values of the constants,
which satisfy all of the equations. In an analysis, the number of
independent constants in the general equation of a curve indicate
how many conditions must be set before a curve can be completely
defined. Also, the number of unknowns in an equation indicates
the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously to
find the values of the unknowns. For example, if B, C, and D
are unknowns in an equation, three separate equations involving
these variables are required for a solution.
A circle may be defined by three noncollinear points; that is,
by three points not lying on a straight line. Only one circle is
possible through any three noncollinear points. To find the
2-10

equation of the circle determined by three points, substitute the
x and y values of each of the given points into the general
equation to form three equations with B, C, and D as the
unknowns. These equations are then solvedsimultaneously to find
the values ofB, C, and D in the equation which satisfies the three
given conditions.
The solution of simultaneous equations involving two variables
is discussed in Mathematics, Volume 1. Systems involving three
variables use an extension of the same principles, but with three
equations instead of two. Step-by-step explanations of the
solution are given in the example problems.
EXAMPLE: Write the equation of the circle that passes
through the points (2,8), (5,7), and (6,6).
SOLUTION: The method used in this solution corresponds
to the addition-subtraction method used for solution of equations
involving two variables. However, the method or combination of
methods used depends on the particular problem. No single
method is best suited to all problems.
First, write the general form of a circle:
x2+ y2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0
For each of the given points, substitute the given values for x and
y and rearrange the terms:
For (2,8)
For (5,7)
For (6,6)
4 + 64 + 2B + 8C + D = 0
2B + 8C + D = - 68
25 + 49 + 5B + 7C + D = 0
5B + 7C + D = -74
36 + 36 + 6B + 6C + D = 0
6B + 6C + D = -72
To aid in the explanation, we number the three resulting
equations:
2B + 8C + D = - 68
5B + 7C + D = -74
6B + 6C + D =
- 72
2-11
Equation (l)
(2)
(3)

The first step is to eliminate one of the unknowns and have two
equations and two unknowns remaining. The coefficient of Dis
the same in all three equations and is, therefore, the one most
easily eliminated by addition and subtraction. To eliminate D,
subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
2B + 8C + D = - 68
5B + 7C + D = -74
-3B +
C

Subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

6B + 6C + D = - 72
-B +
C
=-2
(1)
(-) (2)
(4)
(2)
( - ) (3)
(5)
We now have two equations, (4) and (5), in two unknowns that
can be solved simultaneously. Since the coefficient of C is the same
in both equations, it is the most easily eliminated variable.
To eliminate C, subtract equation (4) from equation (5):
-B+ C = -2
-3B+ C =
6
2B
= -8
(5)
( - ) (4)
B
= -4
(6)
To find the value of C, substitute the value found for B in
equation (6) in equation (4) or (5)
-B+C =-2
-( -4) + C = -2
C= -6
using (5)
(7)
Now the values of Band C can be substituted in anyone of the
original equations to determine the value of D.
If the values are substituted in equation (1),
2B + 8C + D = - 68
2( - 4) + 8( - 6) + D = - 68
- 8 - 48 + D = - 68
D = -68 + 56
D = -12
2-12
(1)
(8)

The solution of the system of equations gave values for three
independent constants in the general equation
x2+ y2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0
When the constant values are substituted, the equation takes the
form of
x2 + y2 - 4x - 6y - 12 = 0
Now rearrange and complete the square in both x and y:
(x2- 4x + 4) + (y2 - 6y + 9) - 12 = 4 + 9
(x - 2)2 + (y - 3)2 = 25
The equation now corresponds to a circle with its center at (2,3)
and a radius of 5. This is the circle passing through three given
points, as shown in figure 2-7, view A.
The previous example problem showed one method we can
use to determine the equation of a circle when three points are
given. The next example shows another method we can use to solve
the same problem. One of the most important things to keep in
mind when you study analytic geometry is that many problems
may be solved by more than one method. Each problem should
be analyzed carefully to determine what relationships exist
between the given data and the desired results of the problem.
Relationships such as distance from one point to another, distance
from a point to a line, slope of a line, and the Pythagorean
theorem will be used to solve various problems.

EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the circle that passes through
the points (2,8), (5,7), and (6,6). Use a method other than that
used in the previous example problem.
SOLUTION: A different method of solving this problem
results from the reasoning in the following paragraphs:
The center of the desired circle will be the intersection of the
perpendicular bisectors of the chords connecting points (2,8) with
(5,7) and (5,7) with (6,6), as shown in figure 2-7, view B.
The perpendicular bisector of the line connecting two points
is the locus of all points equidistant from the two points. Using
this analysis, we can get the equations of the perpendicular
bisectors of the two lines.
Equating the distance formulas that describe the distances from
the center, point (x,y), which is equidistant from the points (2,8)
and (5,7), gives
V(x - 2)2 + (y -
8)2 = V(x - 5)2 + (y - 7)2
Squaring both sides gives
(x - 2)2 + (y - 8)2 = (x - 5)2 + (y - 7)2
or
x 2 -
4x + 4 + y2 - 16y + 64 =
x 2 -
lOx + 25 + y2 - 14y + 49
Canceling and combining terms results in
6x - 2y = 6
or
3x - y = 3
Follow the same procedure for the points (5,7) and (6,6):
V(x - 5)2 + (y - 7)2 = V(x - 6)2 + (y - 6)2
Squaring each side gives
(x - 5)2 + (y - 7)2 = (x - 6)2 + (y - 6)2
or
x2 -
lOx + 25 + y2 - 14y + 49 =
x2 - 12x + 36 + y2 - 12y + 36
2-14

Canceling and combining terms gives a second equation in x and y:
2x - 2y = -2
or
X-Y= -1
Solving the equations simultaneously gives the coordinates of the
intersection of the two perpendicular bisectors; this intersection
is the center of the circle.
3x - y =
3
x - y = - 1 (Subtract)
2x
=
4
x
=
2
Substitute the value x = 2 in one of the equations to find the
value of y:
x-y= -1
2-y= -1
-y = -3
y=3
Thus, the center of the circle is the point (2,3).
The radius is the distance between the center (2,3) and one of
the three given points. Using point (2,8), we obtain
r = V(2 -
2)2 + (8 -
3)2 = V25 = 5
The equation of this circle is
(x - 2)2 + (y - 3)2 = 25
as was found in the previous example.
If a circle is to be defined by three points, the points must be
noncollinear. In some cases the three points are obviously
noncollinear. Such is the case with the points (1,1), ( - 2,2), and
( - 1, - 1), since these points cannot be connected by a straight
line.
However,
in
many
cases
you
may
find
difficulty
determining by inspection whether or not the points are collinear;
2-15

therefore, you need a method for determining this analytically.
In the following example an attempt is made to find the circle
determined by three points that are collinear.
EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the circle that passes through
the points (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).
SOLUTION: Substitute the given values of x and y in the
general form of the equation of a circle to get three equations in
three unknowns:
~ + y2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0
For (1,1)
For (2,2)
For (3,3)
l+l+B+C+D=O
B+C+D=-2
4 + 4 + 2B + 2C + D = 0
2B + 2C + D = -8
9 + 9 + 3B + 3C + D = 0
3B + 3C + D = - 18
Equation (1)
(2)
(3)
To eliminate D, first subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
2B + 2C + D =-8
B+ C+D= -2
B +
C
= -6
Next subtract equation (2) from equation (3):
3B + 3C + D = -18
28 + 2C + D =
-
8
B +
C
= -10
(2)
( - ) (1)
(4)
(3)

Then subtract equation (5) from equation (4) to eliminate one of
the unknowns:
B+C= -

B + C = -10
0+ 0 =
4
0=

2-16
(4)
( - ) (5)

This solution is not valid, so no circle passes through the three
given points. You should attempt to solve equations (4) and (5)
by the substitution method. When the three given points are
collinear, an inconsistent solution of some type will result.
If you try to solve the problem by eliminating both Band C
at the same time (to find D), another type of inconsistent
solution results. With the given coefficients you can easily
eliminate both A and B at the same time. First, multiply
equation (2) by 3 and equation (3) by - 2 and add the resultant
equations:
6B + 6C + 3D =
- 24
- 6B - 6C - 2D =
36
D =

3 (x) (2)
( +) - 2 (x) (3)
Then multiply equation (1) by - 2 and add the resultant to
equation (2):
- 2B - 2C - 2D =
4
2B + 2C + D = -8
-D= -4
D=
4
- 2 (x) (1)
(+) (2)
This gives two values for D, which is inconsistent since
each of the constants must have a unique value consistent
with the given conditions. The three points are on the straight
line y = x.

A parabola is the locus of all points in a plane
equidistant from a fixed point, called the/ocus,
and a fixed line, called the directrix. In the
parabola shown in figure 2-8, point V, which lies
halfway between the focus and the directrix, is
called the vertex of the parabola. In this figure
and in many of the parabolas discussed in the
first portion of this section, the vertex of the
parabola falls at the origin; however, the vertex
of the parabola, like the center of the circle, can
fall at any point in the plane.
Since by definition these two distances are equal,
we may set them equal:
V(x - a)2 + y2 =
X + a
Figure 2-8.-The parabola.
Squaring both sides, we have
2-18

Expanding, we have
Canceling and combining terms, we have an equation for the
parabola:
y2 = 4ax
For every positive value of x in the equation of the parabola,
we have two values of y. But when x becomes negative, the values
of yare imaginary. Thus, the curve must be entirely to the right
of the Yaxis when the equation is in this form. If the equation is
y2 = -4ax
the curve lies entirely to the left of the Yaxis.
If the form of the equation is
the curve opens upward and the focus is a point on the Y axis.
For every positive value of y, you will have two values of x, and
the curve will be entirely above the X axis. Wh~n the equation
is in the form
x 2 = - 4ay
the curve opens downward, is entirely below the X axis, and has
as its focus a point on the negative Y axis. Parabolas that are
representative of the four cases given here are shown in
figure 2-9.
When x is equal to a in the equation
y2 = 4ax
then
and
y = 2a

Figure 2-tO.-Sketch of a parabola.
SOLUTION: First plot the given information on a coordinate
system as shown in figure 2-10, view A. Figure 2-8 shows you that
the point (3,0) corresponds to the position of the focus and that
the line x = - 3 is the directrix of the parabola. Figure 2-8 also
shows you that the length of a is equal to one half the distance
from the focus to the directrix or, in this problem, one
half the distance from x = - 3 to x = 3. Thus, the length
of a is 3.
2-21

The second value required by the problem is the length of the
focal chord. As stated previously, the focal chord length is equal
to 4a. The length of a was found to be 3, so the length of the
focal chord is 12. Figure 2-8 shows that one extremity of the focal
chord is a point on the curve 2a or 6 units above the focus, and
the other extremity is a second point 2a or 6 units below the focus.
Using this information and recalling that the vertex is one-half
the distance from the focus to the directrix, plot three more points
as shown in figure 2-10, view B.
Now a smooth curve through the vertex and the two points
that are the extremities of the focal chord provide a sketch of the
parabola in this problem. (See fig. 2-10, view C.)
To find the equation of the parabola, refer to figure 2-10, view
D, and use the procedure used earlier. We know by definition that
any point P(x,Y) on the parabola is equidistant from the focus
and directrix. Thus, we equate these two distances:
V(x - a)2 + y2 = X + a
However, we have found distance a to be equal to 3, so we
substitute:
V(x - 3)2 + y2 = X + 3
We square both sides:
Then we expand:
x2 - 6x + 9 + y2 = x2 + 6x + 9
We cancel and combine terms to obtain the equation of the
parabola:
y2 = 12x
If we check the consistency of our findings, we see that the
form of the equation and the sketch agree with figure 2-9, view
A. Also, the 12 in the right side of the equation corresponds to
the 4a in the standard form, which is correct since we determined
that the value of a was 3. Or, since the curve is entirely to the
right of the Y axis, then we can apply the formula y2 = 4ax by
substituting a = 3 to give
y2 = 4(3)x
= 12x
2-22

NOTE: When the focus of a parabola lies on the Y axis, the
equated distance equation is
v(y - a)2 + J? = Y + a
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
Give the equation; the length of a; and the length of the focal
chord for the parabola, which is the locus of all points
equidistant from the point and the line, given in the following
problems:
1. The point (- 2,0) and the line x = 2
2. The point (0,4) and the line y = - 4
3. The point (0, -1) and the line y = 1
4. The point (1,0) and the line x = - 1
ANSWERS:
1. y2 =
- 8x, a = 2, f.e. = 8
2. x 2 = 16y, a = 4, f.e. = 16
3. x 2 = - 4y, a = 1, j.e. = 4
4. y2 = 4x, a = 1, j.e. = 4
Up to now, all of the parabolas we have dealt with have had
a vertex at the origin and a corresponding equation in one of the
four following forms:
1. y2 = 4ax
2. y2 = -4ax
2-23

3. xl = 4ay
4. xl = -4ay
We will now present four more forms of the equation of a
parabola. Each one is a standardized parabola with its vertex at
point V(h,k). When the vertex is moved from the origin to the
point V(h,k), the x and y terms of the equation are replaced by
(x - h) and (y - k). Then the standard equation for the parabola
that opens to the right (fig. 2-9, view A) is
(y - k)2 = 4a(x - h)
The four standard forms of the equations for parabolas with
vertices at the point V(h,k) are as follows:
1. (y - k)2 = 4a(x - h), corresponding to y2 = 4ax,
parabola opens to the right
2. (y - k)2 = - 4a(x - h), corresponding to y2 = - 4ax,
parabola opens to the left
3. (x - h)2 = 4a(y - k), corresponding to x2 = 4ay,
parabola opens upward
4. (x - h)2 =
- 4a(y - k), corresponding to x2 = - 4ay,
parabola opens downward
The method for reducing an equation to one of these
standard forms is similar to the method used for reducing
the equation of a circle.
EXAMPLE: Reduce the equation
y2 - 6y - 8x + I = 0
to standard form.
SOLUTION: Rearrange the equation so that the second-degree
term and any first-degree terms of the same unknown are on the
left side. Then group the unknown term appearing only in the first
degree and all constants on the right:
y2 - 6y = 8x -
1
Then complete the square in y:
y2 - 6y + 9 = 8x - 1 + 9
(y - 3)2 = 8x + 8
2-24

To get the equation in the form
(y - k)2 = 4a(x - h)
factor an 8 out of the right side. Thus,
(y - 3)2 = 8(x + 1)
is the equation of the parabola with its vertex at (- 1,3).
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
Reduce the equations given in the following problems to
standard form:
1. x2 + 4 = 4y
2. y2 - 4x = 6y - 9
3. 4x + 8y + y2 + 20 = 0
4. 4x - 12y + 40 + x 2 = 0
ANSWERS:
1. xl = 4(y -
1)
2. (y - 3)2 = 4x
3. (y + 4)2 = - 4(x + 1)
4. (x + 2)2 = 12(y - 3)

This is the equation of an ellipse in standard

length of the semimajor axis and b is the length
of the semiminor axis.
The curve is symmetrical with respect to the
X and Yaxes, so you can easily see that figure
2-14, view A, has another focus at (ae,O) and a
corresponding directrix, x = a/e. The curve also
has vertices at (± a,O).
The distance from the center through the
focus to the curve is always designated a and is
called the semimajor axis. This axis may be in
either the x or y direction. When it is in the y
direction, the directrix is a line denoted by the
equation

In the case we have studied, the directrix was denoted by the
formula
x=k
where k is a constant equal to ± a/e.
The perpendicular distance from the midpoint of the major
axis to the curve is called the semiminor axis and is always signified
by b.
The distance from the center of the ellipse to the focus is
called c. In any ellipse the following relations are true for
a, b, and c:
Whenever the directrix is a line denoted by the equation y = k,
the major axis is in the y direction and the equation of the ellipse
is as follows:
Refer to figure 2-14, view B. This curve has foci at (0, ± c) and
vertices at (0, ± a).
In an ellipse the position of the a2 and b 2 terms indicates the
orientation of the ellipse axis. As shown in figure 2-14, views A
and B, value a is the semimajor or longer axis.
In the previous paragraphs formulas were given showing the
relationship between a, b, and c. In the first portion of this discus-
sion, a formula showing the relationship between a, c, and the
eccentricity was given. These relationships are used to find the
equation of an ellipse in the following example:
EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the ellipse with its center
at the origin and having foci at (± 2V6,0) and an eccentricity

.
SOLUTION: With the focal points on the X axis, the ellipse
is oriented as in figure 2-14, view A, and the standard form of
the equation is

With the center at the origin, the numerators of the fractions
on the left are x2 and y2. The problem is to find the values of
a and b.
The distance from the center to either of the foci is equal to
c (fig. 2-14, view A), so in this problem
c= 2'./6
from the given coordinates of the foci.
The values of a, c, and e (eccentricity) are related by

An ellipse may be defined as the locus of
all points in a plane, the sum of whose
distances from two fixed points, called the
foci, is a constant equal to 2a. This is shown
as follows:
Let the foci be F 1 and F 2 at (± e,O), as
shown in figure 2-15. Using the standard form
of an ellipse,

so
= 2a
Whenever the center of the ellipse is at some point other than
(0,0), such as the point (h,k) in figure 2-16, views A and B, the
equation of the ellipse must be modified to the following
standard forms:
(x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = 1
a2
b 2
(2.8)
(2.9)
Subtracting h from the value of x reduces the value of the term
(x - h) to the value x would have if the center were at the origin.
The term (y - k) is identical in value to the value ofy if the center
were at the origin.
Whenever we have an equation in the general form, such as
Ax
2 + Cy 2 + Dx + Ey + F = °
where the capital letters refer to independent constants and A and
C have the same sign, we can reduce the equation to the standard
2-33

form for an ellipse. Completing the square in both x and y and
performing a few simple algebraic transformations will change
the form to that of equations (2.8) and (2.9).
Theorem: An equation of the second degree, in which the xy
term does not exist and the coefficients ofx2and y2 are different
but have the same sign, represents an ellipse with axes parallel
to the coordinate axes.
EXAMPLE: Reduce the equation
4x2+ 9y2 - 40x - 54y + 145 = 0
to an ellipse in standard form.
SOLUTION:
Collect terms
III x and y and remove the
common factors of these terms:
4x2 - 40x + 9y2 - 54y + 145 = 0
4(x2 - lOx) + 9(y2 - 6y) + 145 = 0
Transpose the constant terms and complete the square in both
x and y. When factored terms are involved in completing the
square, as in this example, an error is frequently made. The
factored value operates on the term added inside the parentheses
as well as the original terms. Therefore, the values added to the
right side of the equation are the products of the factored values
and the terms added to complete the square:
4(x2 - lOx + 25) + 9(y2 - 6y + 9)
= -145 + 4(25) + 9(9)
- 145 + 100 + 81
= 36
4 (x - 5) 2 + 9(y - 3)2 = 36
Divide both sides by the right-hand (constant) term. This
reduces the right member to 1 as required by the standard form:
4(x - 5)2 + 9(y - 3)2 = 1
36
36
(x - 5)2 + (y - 3)2 = 1

2-34

This reduces to the standard form
(x - 5)2 + (y - 3)2 = I
(3)2
(2)2
corresponding to equation (2.8). This equation represents an ellipse
with the center at (5,3); its semimajor axis, a, equal to 3; and its
semiminor axis, b, equal to 2.
EXAMPLE: Reduce the equation
3x2 + y2 + 20x + 32 = 0
to an ellipse in standard form.
SOLUTION: First, collect terms in x and y. As in the previous
example, the coefficients of x2 and y2 must be reduced to I to
complete the square in both x and y. Thus the coefficient of the
x 2 term is divided out of the two terms containing x, as follows:
3x2 + 20x + y2 + 32 = 0
3(x' + 2~X)
+ y' = - 32
Complete the square in x, noting that a product is added to the
right side:
3(x' + 2~X + '~) + y' = -32 + 3(1:)
3(X + '30)' + y' = -2889+ 300
3(X + '3°)' + y' ~ ';
3(X+ '3°)' +y' =~

developed in the section concerning the ellipse
were derived so that they are true for any value
of eccentricity. Thus, they are true for the
hyperbola as well as for an ellipse. Since e is
greater than 1 for a hyperbola, then
Therefore c > a > d.
Figure 2-17.-The hyperbola.
According to this analysis, if the center
of symmetry of a hyperbola is the origin,
then the foci lies farther from the origin
than the directrices. An inspection of figure 2-17
shows that the curve never crosses the Y axis.
Thus the solution for the value of b, the
semiminor axis of the ellipse, yields no real
2-37

value for b. In other wordst b is an imaginary number. This can
easily be seen from the equation
since c > a for a hyperbola.
Howevert we can square both sides of the the above equationt
and since the square of an imaginary number is a negative real
number we write
or
andt since c = aet
Now we can use this equation to obtain the equation of a
hyperbola from the following equationt which was developed in
the section on the ellipse:
and since
we have
This is a standard form for the equation of a hyperbola with
its centert Ot at the origin. The solution of this equation for y gives
which shows that y is imaginary only when x 2 < a2 • The curvet
therefore, lies entirely beyond the two lines x = ± a and crosses
the X axis at V1(atO) and V2( - atO)t the vertices of the hyperbola.
2-38

The two straight lines
bx + ay = 0 and bx - ay = 0
(2.10)
can be used to illustrate an interesting property of a hyperbola.
The distance from the line bx - ay = 0 to the point (XI ,yl) on the
curve is given by
d = bXI - aYI
V0 2 + b 2
(2.11)
Since (XI ,YI) is on the curve, its coordinates satisfy the equation
which may be written
or
Now substituting this value into equation (2.11) gives us
As the point (XItYI) is chosen farther and farther from the
center of the hyperbola, the absolute values for XI and YI will
increase and the distance, d, will approach zero. A similar result
can easily be derived for the line bx + ay = O.
The lines of equation (2.10), which are usually written

are called the asymptotes of the hyperbola. They are very
important in tracing a curve and studying its properties. The

Figure 2-18.-Using asymptotes to sketch a hyperbola.
asymptotes of a hyperbola, figure 2-18, are the diagonals of the
rectangle whose center is the center of the curve and whose sides
are parallel and equal to the axes of the curve. The focal chord
2b2
of a hyperbola is equal to -.
a
Another definition of a hyperbola is the locus of all points
in a plane such that the difference of their distances from two
fixed points is constant. The fixed points are the foci, and the
constant difference is 2a.
The nomenclature of the hyperbola is slightly different from
that of an ellipse. The transverse axis is of length 2a and is the
distance between the intersections (vertices) of the hyperbola with
its focal axis. The conjugate axis is of length 2b and is
perpendicular to the transverse axis.
Whenever the foci are on the Y axis and the directrices are
lines of the form y = ± k, where k is a constant, the equation of
the hyperbola will read
This equation represents a hyperbola with its transverse axis on
the
Y axis. Its asymptotes are the lines by - ax = 0 and
by + ax = 0 or

The properties of the hyperbola most often used in analysis
of the curve are the foci, directrices, length of the focal chord,
and the equations of the asymptotes.
Figure 2-17 shows that the foci are given by the points F I (c,O)
and F 2 ( - c,O) when the equation of the hyperbola is in the form
If the equation were
the foci would be the points (O,c) and (0, - c). The value of c is
either determined from the formula
or the formula
c = ae
Figure 2-17 also shows that the directrices are the lines
x = ± ~ or, in the case where the hyperbolas open upward and
downward, Y =
±~. This was also given earlier in this discussion

Note that you have no restriction of a > b for the hyperbola
as you have for the ellipse. Instead, the direction in which the
hyperbola opens corresponds to the transverse axis on which the
foci and vertices lie.
2-41

The properties of a hyperbola can be determined from the
equation of a hyperbola or the equation can be written given
certain properties, as shown in the following examples. In these
examples and in the practice problems immediately following, all
of the hyperbolas considered have their centers at the origin.
EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the hyperbola with an
eccentricity of 3/2, directrices x = ± 4/3, and foci at (± 3,0).
SOLUTION: The foci lie on the X axis at the points (3,0) and
( - 3,0), so the equation is of the form
This fact is also shown by the equation of the directrices.
Since we have determined the form of the equation and since
the center of the curve in this section is restricted to the origin,
the problem is reduced to finding the values of a2 and b2 •
First, the foci are given as (± 3,0); and since the foci are also
the points (± c,O), then
c=3

determined from the formula

results and is the equation of the hyperbola.
The equation could also be found by the use of other
relationships using the given information.

and, since
d=~e
or
a = de
substituting the values given for d and e results in
therefore,
a=2

With values for 0 and c computedt the value of b is found as

With a and b known t we find c by using the formula
c =V 9 + 16
c='125
c=5
From the form of the equation t we know that the foci are at the
points
and
so the foci = (± 5tO).
The eccentricity is found by the formula
c
e=-a

e=-3
Figure 2-17 shows that with the center at the origin t c and a will
have the same sign.
The directrix is found by the formula

Finally, the equations of the asymptotes are the equations of the
two straight lines:

and
bx - ay = 0
In this problem, substituting the values of a and b m each
equation gives
4x + 3y = 0
and
4x - 3y = 0

4x ± 3y = 0

would have its y intercept at the origin as shown in figure 2-18.

POLAR COORDINATES
So far we have located a point in a plane by giving the distances
of the point from two perpendicular lines. We can define the
location of a point equally well by noting its distance and bear-
ing. This method is commonly used aboard ship to show the
position of another ship or target. Thus, 3 miles at 35
0 locates
the position of a ship relative to the course of the ship making the
reading. We can use this method to develop curves and bring out
their properties. Assume a ftxed direction OX and a ftxed point 0 on
2-48

the line in figure 2-19. The position of any point, P,
is fully determined if we know the directed distance
from 0 to P and the angle that the line OP makes
with reference line OX. The line OP is called the
radius vector and the angle POX is called the polar
angle. The radius vector is denoted by (2, while e
denotes the polar angle.
Point
0
is
the
pole
or
origin.
As
in
conventional trigonometry, the polar angle is positive
when measured counterclockwise and negative when
measured clockwise. However, unlike the convention
established in trigonometry, the radius vector for
polar coordinates is positive only when it is laid off
on the terminal side of the angle. When the radius
vector is laid off on the terminal side of the ray
produced beyond the pole (the given angle plus 180°).
a negative value is assigned the radius vector. For this
reason, more than one equation may be used in polar
coordinates to describe a given locus. It is sufficient
that you remember that the radius vector can be
negative. In this course, however, the radius vector,
(2, will always be positive.

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
I. Conic section: A conic section is the locus of all points in a
plane whose distance from a fixed point is a constant ratio to
its distance from a fixed line. The fixed point is the focus, and
the fixed line is the directrix. The ratio referred to is called the
eccentricity.
2. Eccentricity:
If 0 < e < 1, then the curve is an ellipse.
If e > 1, then the curve is a hyperbola.
If e = 1, then the curve is a parabola.
If e = 0, then the curve is a circle.
3 . Locus of an equation: The locus of an equation is a curve
containing those points,
and only those points,
whose
coordinates satisfy the equation.
4. Circle: A circle is the locus of all points, in a plane that
is always a fixed distance, called the radius, from a fixed
point, called the center.
Theorem: An equation of the second degree, in which the
coefficients of the x2and y2 terms are equal and the xy term
does not exist represents a circle.
5 . Standard equation of a circle:
where (x,y) is a point on the circle, (h,k) is the center,
and r is the radius of the circle.
6. General equation of a circle:
x2+ y2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0
where B, C, and D are constants.
7 . Circle defined by three points: A circle may be defined by
three noncollinear points; that is, by three points not lying on
2-54

a straight line. Only one circle is possible through any three
noncollinear points. To find the equation of the circle
determined by three points, substitute the x and y values of each
of the given points into the general equation to form three
equations with B, C, and D as the unknowns. These equations
are then solved simultaneously to find the values of B, C, and
D in the equation that satisfies the three given conditions.
8. Parabola: A parabola is the locus of all points in a plane
equidistant from a fixed point, called the focus, and a fixed
line, called the directrix.
The point which lies halfway between the focus and the
directrix is called the vertex.
The focal chord is equal to 4a, where a is the distance from
the vertex to the focus.
A parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening to the
right has its focus at (a,O) and its directrix at x = - a; its
corresponding equation is y2 = 4ax.
A parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening to the
left has its focus at (- a,O) and its directrix at x = a; its
corresponding equation is y2 = - 4ax.
A parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening upward
has its focus
at
(O,a)
and its directrix at y =
- a;
its
corresponding equation is x 2 = 4ay.
A parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening downward
has its focus
at (0, - a) and its directrix at y = a;
its
corresponding equation is x 2 =
- 4ay.
9. Standard equations for parabolas:
1. (y - k)2 = 4a(x - h) (parabola opening to the right)
2. (y - k)2 = - 4a(x - h) (parabola opening to the left)
3. (x - h)2 = 4a(y - k) (parabola opening upward)
4. (x - h)2 =
~ 4a(y - k) (parabola opening downward)
where (h,k) is the coordinate of the vertex and a is the
distance from the vertex to the focus.
2-55

10. Ellipse: An ellipse is the locus of all points, in a plane
the sum of whose distances from two fixed points (the
foci) is a constant equal to 2a.
The ellipse is symmetrical with respect to the X and Yaxes,
so an ellipse with its center at the origin and its major
axis along the X
axis has foci at (± ae,O) or (±c,O),
vertices
at (± a,O),
and
directrices
at
x = ± ale;
its
2

corresponding equation is ;2 + ~ = 1.
An ellipse with its center at the origin and its major axis
along the Y axis has foci at (0, ± ae) or (0, ± c), vertices at
(0, ± a),
and directrices at y = ± ale;
its corresponding

equatIon IS b 2 + a2 = 1.
The distance from the center through the focus to the
curve
is
always
designated
by a and
is
called
the
semimajor
axis.
The
perpendicular
distance
from
the
midpoint of the major axis to the curve is called the
semiminor axis and is always signified by b. The distance
from the center of the ellipse to the focus is called c. The
eccentricity is designated bye, which is equal to cia.
The following relationships are true for a, b, and c in an
ellipse:
c = V0 2_ b2 or c2 = a2 - b2
b = V0 2 _ c2
or b2 = a2- c2
a = Vb2+ c2 or a2 = b2+ c
2
c<a
and
b<a
Theorem: ~n equation of the second degree, in which the xy
term does not exist and the coeficients of x2 and y2 are
different but have the same sign, represents an ellipse with
axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

12. General equation of an ellipse:
Ax
2 + Cy 2 + Dx + Ey + F = °
where the capital letters refer to independent constants
and A and C have the same sign.
13. Hyperbola: A hyperbola is the locus of all points in a plane
such that the difference of their distances from two
fixed points is constant. The fixed points are thefoei and the
constant difference is 2a.
The transverse axis is of length 2a and is the distance between
the intersections (vertices) of the hyperbola with its focal axis.
The conjugate axis is of length 2b and is perpendicular to the
transverse axis.
The focal chord of a hyperbola is equal to 2b2Ia.
A hyperbola with its center at the origin and transverse axis
along the X axis has foci at (± ae,O) or (± c,O), vertices
at
(±a,O), directrices
at
x = ±ale, and
asymptotes

15. General equation of a hyperbola:
Ax2 + ey 2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
where the capital letters refer to independent constants and
A and e have different signs.
16. Polar coordinates: The position of any point, P, is fully
determined if we know the directed distance, called the
radius vector, and the angle that the radius vector makes with
the reference line, called the polar angle. The radius vector
is denoted by Q, while edenotes the polar angle. The origin
is also called the pole.
The polar angle is positive when measured counterclockwise
and negative when measured clockwise. The radius vector is
positive only when it is laid off on the terminal side of the
angle. When the radius vector is laid off on the terminal side
of the ray produced beyond the pole (the given angle plus
180°), a negative value is assigned the radius vector.

INTRODUCTION
In chapter 1, the notationt was introduced to represent the
slope of a line. The straight line discussed had a constant
slope and the symbol Ay was defined as (Y2 - YI) and Ax
was defined as
(X2 - XI).
In this chapter we will discuss
the
slope of curves
at
specific
points
on
the
curves.
We
will
do
this
with
as
little calculus as
possible,
but
our
discussion
will
be
directed
toward
the
study of
calculus.

In figure 3-1 the slope of the curve is represented
at two different places by t.
The value of
t
on the lower part of the curve is extremely
close to the actual slope at PI because PI lies
on a
nearly
straight portion of the curve.
The value of the slope at P 2 is less accurate
than the slope near PI
because P 2 lies on a
portion of the curve that has more curvature
than
the
portion of the
curve
near
PI-
To
obtain an accurate measure of the slope of the
curve at each point, as small a portion of the
curve as
possible should
be
used.
When
the
curve
is
nearly
a
straight
line,
a
very small
error will occur when you are finding the slope,
regardless of the value of the increments Ayand Ax.
If the curvature is great and large increments
are used when you are finding the slope of a
curve, the error will become very large.
Thus, the error can be reduced to as small an amount as you
want provided you choose your increments to be sufficiently small.
Whenever the slope of a curve at a given point is desired, the
increments Ay and Ax should be extremely small. Consequently,
the arc of the curve can be replaced by a straight line,
which determines the slope of the line tangent to the curve
at that point.
You must understand that when we speak
of the line tangent to
a curve at
a specific
point, we are really considering the secant line,
which cuts a curve in at least two points. Refer
to figure 3-2. As point P 2 moves closer to point
PI, the slope of the secant line varies by smaller
and smaller amounts and causes the secant line
between PI and P 2 to approach PI. PI is then
extended to form the line tangent to the curve
at that specific point.
If we allow
to represent the equation of a curve, then t
is
the slope of the line tangent to the curve at P(x,y).
Figure 3-2.-Curve with secant line and
tangent line.

The direction of a curve is defined as the direction
of the tangent line at any point on the curve. Let 8
equal the inclination of the tangent line; then the
slope equals tan 8 and
~ = tan 8
is the slope of the curve at any point p(x,y). The angle
81 is the inclination of the tangent line at PI in figure
3-3. This angle is acute and the value of tan 81 is pos-
itive. Hence, the slope of the tangent line is positive at
point PI. The angle 82 is an obtuse angle, tan 82 is
negative, and the slope of the tangent line at point P2
is negative. All lines leaning to the right have positive
slopes, and all lines leaning to the left have negative
slopes. At point P 3 the tangent line to the curve is
horizontal and 8 equals O. This means that
~ = tan 0° = 0

TANGENT AT A GIVEN POINT
ON THE STANDARD PARABOLA
The fact that the slope of a curve is zero when the tangent line
to the curve at that point is horizontal is of great importance in
calculus when you are determining the maximum or minimum
points of a curve. Whenever the slope ofa curve is zero, the curve
may be at either a maximum or a minimum.
Whenever the inclination of the tangent line to
a curve at a point is 90°, the tangent line is vertical
and parallel to the Yaxis. This results in an infinitely
large slope where
t = tan 90 ° = 00
The standard parabola is represented by the
equation
y2 = 4ax
Let PI with coordinates (XltYI) be a point on the
curve. Choose P' on the curve, figure 3-4, near
the given point so that the coordinates of pi are
(X2,Y2). As previously stated
3-3

and
Ay = Y2 - Yt
so that by rearranging terms, the coordinates of p' may be
written as
Since p' is a point on the curve,
y2 = 4ax
the values of its coordinates may be substituted for x and y. This
gives
or
(3.1)
The point Pt(xhYt) also lies on the curve, so we have
yf = 4ax 1
Substituting this value for yf into equation (3.1) transforms it
into
Simplifying, we obtain
(3.2)
Divide both sides by Ax, obtaining
which gives
3-4

Solving for ~' we find
2a
-
Yt
(3.3)
Before proceeding, we need to discuss the term
in equation (3.3). If we solve equation (3.2) for l1y, we find
then
l1y(2Yt + l1y) = 4al1x
and
4al1x
l1y = 2Yt + l1y
Since the denominator contains a term not dependent upon l1y
or 11x, as we let I1x approach zero, l1y will also approach zero.
NOTE: We may find a value for I1xthat will make l1y less than
1; then when l1y is squared, it will approach zero at least as rapidly
as I1x does.
We now refer to equation (3.3) again and make the statement
~
so that we may disregard
I1x
2Yt.
since it approaches zero when I1x approaches zero.

Then

Ax= YI
(3.4)
The quantity ~ is the slope of the line connecting PI and
P'. From figure 3-4, the slope of the curve at PI is obviously dif-
ferent from the slope of the line connecting PI and P'.
As Ax and Ay approach zero, the ratio t
will approach
more and more closely the true slope of the curve at PI. We
designate the slope by m. Thus, as Ax approaches zero, equation
(3.4) becomes

m=-

Clearing fractions, we have

This is the equation of the tangent line to the parabola

y 2 = 8x
find the slope of the curve and the equation of the tangent line
at the point (2,4).

TANGENT AT A GIVEN POINT ON
OTHER CURVES
The technique used to find the slope and equation of the
tangent line for a standard parabola can be used to find the slope
and equation of the tangent line to a curve at any point regardless
of the type of curve. The method can be used to find these rela-
tionships for circles, hyperbolas, ellipses, and general algebraic
curves.
This general method is outlined as follows: To find the slope,
m, ofa given curve at the point PI (XhYI), choose a secondpoint,
P, on the curve so that it has coordinates (XI + Ax, YI + Ay); then
substitute each of the coordinates of p' and PI in the equation
ofthe curve and simplify. Divide both sides by Ax and eliminate
terms that contain powers of Ay higher than the first power, as
previously discussed. Solve for ~. Let Ax approach zero and
~ will approach the slope of the tangent line, m, at point PI.
When the slope and coordinates of a point on the curve are
known, you can find the equation of the tangent line by using
the point-slope method.
EXAMPLE: Using the method outlined, find the slope and
equation of the tangent line to the curve

EQUATIONS AND LENGTHS OF

In figure 3-5, the coordinates of point Pion
the curve are (XI,YI). Let the slope of the tangent
line to the curve at point PI be denoted by mi.

the tangent line passes, you can determine the
equation of that tangent line by using the point-
slope form.

in the following:

Notice that since the slope of the tangent line is ml and the
slope of the line which is normal to the tangent is m2 and
1
m2= --
ml
then the product of the slopes of the tangent and normal lines
equals - 1. The relationship between the slopes of the tangent and
normal lines is stated more formally as follows: The slope of
the normal line is the negative reciprocal ofthe slope ofthe tangent
line.
Another approach to show the relationship between the slopes
of the tangent and normal lines follows: The inclination of one
line must be 90° greater than the other. Then
82 =8 1 + 90°

The length ofthe normal is defined as that portion of the nor-

To illustrate the application of a parameter, we
will assume that an aircraft takes off from a
field, which we will call the origin. Figure 3-6 shows
the diagram we will use. The aircraft is flying on a
compass heading of due north. There is a wind blow-
ing from the west at 20 miles per hour, and the
airspeed of the aircraft is 400 miles per hour. Let the
direction of the positive Yaxis be due north and the
positive X axis be due east, as shown in figure 3-6.
Use the scales as shown.
One hour after takeoff the position of the aircraft, represented
by point P, is 400 miles north and 20 miles east of the origin. If
we use t as the parameter, then at any time, t, the aircraft's posi-
tion (x,y) will be given by x equals 20t and y equals 4OOt. The equa-
tions are
t (or 8) is called a parameter. The two equations
x = x(t) and y = y(t) [or x = x(8) and y = y(8)] are
called parametric equations.
MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE
x = 20t
and
y = 400t
and are called parametric equations. Notice that time is not
plotted on the graph of figure 3-6. The parameter t is used only to
plot the position (x,y) of the aircraft.
We may eliminate the parameter t to obtain a direct relation-
ship between x and y as follows:
If
x
t = 20
then
y = 400(:0)
y = 20x
and we find the graph to be a straight line. When we eliminated
the parameter, the result was the rectangular coordinate equation
of the line.

MOTION IN A CIRCLE
Consider the parametric equations
x = r cos t
and
y = r sin t
These equations describe the position of a point (x,Y) at any
time, t. They can be transposed into a single equation by squar-
ing both sides of each equation to obtain
y2 = r2 sin2t
and adding
Rearranging, we have
but
so that
which is· the equation of a circle.
This means that if various values were assigned to t and the
corresponding values of x and y were calculated and plotted, the
result would be a circle. In other words, the point (x,y) moves
in a circular path.
Using this example again, that is
x = r cos t
and
y = r sin t
3-20

and given that
Ax
m 2 = At = - r sin t
and
ml = ~ = r cos t
we are able to express the slope at any point on the circle in terms
of t.
NOTE: We may find the expressions fort and i7 by using
calculus, but we will accept them for the present without proof.
If we know ~ and t", we may find~, which is the slope of
a curve at any point.

EXAMPLE: Find the equations of the tangent line and the

If e = 45 0 is substituted in the parametric equations, then
x = 2 cos 45
0 = 2(Yf) = Vi
and
y = 2 sin 45 0 = 2(Yf) = Vi
The equation of the tangent line when e = 45
0 is
y - '12 = - 1(x - y'2)
or
x+ y = 2'12
The equation of the normal is
y - '12 = 1(x - y'2)
or
x-y=O
The length of the tangent is
j(gj' + (v'2)' = 2
The length of the normal is
j (Vi·- 1)2 + (Vi)2 = 2
The horizontal and vertical tangents of a curve can be found
very easily when the curve is represented by parametric equations.
The slope of a curve at any point equals zero when the tangent
line is parallel to the X axis. In parametric equations, if x = x(t)

easily by setting

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
1. Slope of a curve at a point:
~ = tan (]
where (] equals the inclination of the tangent line. If the line
tangent to the curve is horizontal, then
t
= tan 0
0 = 0
If the line tangent to the curve is vertical, then
Ay = tan 90 0 =
00
Ax
When the slope of a curve is zero, the curve may be at either
a maximum or a minimum.
2. Tangent at a given point on the standard parabola y2 = 4ax:
2a
m=-
YI
where a is the same as in the standard equation for parabolas,
and YI is the y coordinate of the given point (XJ,YI).
3. Tangent at a given point on other curves: To find the slope,
m, of a given curve at point P1(XJ,YI), choose a second point,
p', on the curve so that it has coordinates (XI + Ax,YI + Ay);
then substitute each of the coordinates of P' and PI in the equa-
tion of the curve and simplify. Divide both sides by Ax and
eliminate terms that contain powers of fly higher than the first
power. Solve for ~. Let Ax approach zero andt will approach
the slope of the tangent line, m, at point PI.
4. Equation of the tangent line:
Y - YI = m I(x - x I)
5. Equation of the normal line:
3-30

6. Relationships between the slopes of the tangent and normal lines: The slope of the
normal line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line.
The inclination of one line must be 90 0 greater than the other.
7. Length of the tangent: The length of the tangent is defined as that portion of the
tangent line between the point P1(XI,YI) and the point where the tangent line crosses
the X axis.
length of the tangent
=V(~'.)' + (Y,l'
8. Length of the normal: The length of the normal is defined as that portion of the
normal line between the point P1(XItYI) and the X axis.
length of the normal =V(Ylml)2 + (yt)2
9. Parametric equations: If the variables x and y of the Cartesian coordinate system
are expressed in terms of a third variable, say t (or 8), then the variable t (or 8) is
called a parameter. The two equations x = x(t) and y = y(t) [or x = x(8) andY =y(8)]
are called parametric equations.

CHAPTER 4
LIMITS AND DIFFERENTIATION
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:
1. Define a limit,
find the limit of indeterminate forms,
and apply limit formulas.
2. Define an infinitesimal, determine the sum and product of
infinitesimals, and restate the concept of infinitesimals.
3. Identify discontinuities in a function.
4. Relate
increments to
differentiation,
apply the general
formula for differentiation, and find the derivative of a
function using the general formula.
INTRODUCTION
Limits and differentiation are the beginning of the study of
calculus, which is an important and powerful method of
computation.
LIMIT CONCEPT
The study of the limit concept is very important, for it is the
very heart of the theory and operation of calculus. We will
include in this section the definition of limit, some of the
indeterminate forms of limits, and some limit formulas, along
with example problems.
DEFINITION OF LIMIT
Before we start differentiation, we must understand certain
concepts. One of these concepts deals with the limit of a
4-1

10
20
function. Many times you will need to find the
value of the limit of a function.
The discussion of limits will begin with an
intuitive point of view.
We will work with the equation
Y =f(x) = x
2
which
is
shown
in
figure
4-1.
Point
P
represents the point corresponding to
Y = 16
and
x=4
The behavior of y for given values of x
near the point
x=4
is the center of the discussion. For the present
we will exclude point P, which is encircled on
the graph.
We will start with values lying between and
including

The corresponding interval for y is between
and includes
y=4
and
y = 36
4-2
Figure 4·1.-(A) Graph of y = x 2 ; (8) value chart.

We now take a smaller interval, DE, about x = 4 by using
values of
x=3
and
x=5
and find the corresponding interval for y to be between
y=9
and
y = 25
inclusively.
These intervals for x and yare written as
O<lx- 4 1<1
and
9 <y< 25
As we diminish the interval of x around
x = 4 (intervals ON and JK)
we find the values of
to be grouped more and more closely around
y = 16
This is shown by the chart in figure 4-1, view B.
Although we have used only a few intervals of x in the discus-
sion, you should easily see that we can make the values about y
group as closely as we desire by merely limiting the values
assigned to x about
x=4
4-3

Because the foregoing is true, we may now say that the limit
of x 2 , as x approaches 4, results in the value 16 for y, and we write
lim x 2 = 16
x_4
In the general form we may write
lim f(x) = L
x_a
(4.1)
Equation (4.1) means that as x approaches a, the limit off(x) will
approach L, where L is the limit of f(x) as x approaches a. No
statement is made about f(a), for it mayor may not exist, although
the limit of f(x) , as x approaches a, is defined.
We are now ready to define a limit.
Let f(x) be defined for all x in the interval near
x=a
but not necessarily at
x=a
Then there exists a number, L, such thatfor every positive number
£ (epsilon), however small,
If(x) - L I < £
provided that we may find a positive number d (delta) such that
O<lx-al<d
Then we say L is the limit off(x) as x approaches a, and we write
lim f(x) = L
x_a
This means that for every given number £ > 0, we must find
a numberd such that the difference between f(x) and L is smaller
than the number £ whenever
O<lx-al<d
4-4

EXAMPLE: Suppose we are given £ = 0.1 and
.
x 2 +x-2
11m
3(
_ 1)
= 1
x_I
X
find ad> O.
SOLUTION: We must find a number d such that for all points
except
x = 1
we have the difference between f(x) and 1 smaller than 0.1.
We write
x
2 +x-2_ 1 <01
3(x - 1)
.
and
=(x + 2)(x -
1) _ 1
3(x -
1)
and we consider only values where
x =1= 1
Simplifying the first term, we have
(x + 2)(x -
1) _ x + 2
3(x -
1)
-
3
Finally, combine terms as follows:
4-5

so that
x-I
3
< 0.1
or
Ix-I 1<0.3
Therefore, d = 0.3 and we have fulfilled the definition of the
limit.
If the limit of a function exists, then
lim f(x) = f(a)
x_a
So we can often evaluate the limit by substitution.
For instance, to find the limit of the function x 2
-
3x + 2 as
x approaches 3, we substitute 3 for x in the function. Then
f(3) = 32 -
3(3) + 2
=9-9+2
= 2
Since x is a variable, it may assume a value as close to 3 as
we wish; and the closer we choose the value of x to 3, the closer
f(x) will approach the value of 2. Therefore, 2 is called the limit
of f(x) as x approaches 3, and we write
lim (x2 -
3x + 2) = 2
x_3

INDETERMINATE FORMS
When the value of a limit is obtained by substitution and it
assumes any of the following forms, another method for finding
the limit must be used:
These are called indeterminate forms.
There are
many
methods
of evaluating
indeterminate
forms.
Two
methods of evaluating indeterminate forms
4-7

are
(1) factoring and
(2) division of the numerator and
denominator by powers of the variable.
Sometimes factoring will resolve an indeterminate form.
EXAMPLE: Find the limit of

SOL UTION: By substitution we find
.
x 2 -
9
0
hm
_ 3 = 0
x_3
X
which is an indeterminate form and is therefore excluded as a
possible limit. We must now search for a method to find the limit.
Factoring is attempted, which results in
x 2 -
9
(x + 3)(x - 3)
x-3
x-3
=x+3
so that
lim (x + 3) = 6
x_3
and we have a determinate limit of 6.
Another indeterminate form is often met when we try to find
the limit of a function as the independent variable approaches
infinity.
EXAMPLE: Find the limit of
x* + 2x3 -
3x2 + 2x
3x* - 2x2 + 1
as x_oo.

LIMIT THEOREMS
To obtain results in calculus, we will frequently operate with
limits. The proofs of theorems shown in this section will be

INFINITESIMALS
In chapter 3, we found the slope of a curve at a given point
by taking very small increments of Ay and Ax, and the slope was
said to be equal to ~~. This section will be a continuation of
this concept.
DEFINITION
A variable that approaches 0 as a limit is called an infinitesimal.
This may be written as
lim V = 0
or
V-o
4-13

and means, as recalled from a previous section of this chapter,
that the numerical value of V becomes and remains less than any
positive number Eo
If the
lim V = L
then
lim V - L = °
which indicates the difference between a variable and its limit is
an infinitesimal. Conversely, if the difference between a variable
and a constant is an infinitesimal, then the variable approaches
the constant as a limit.
EXAMPLE: As x becomes increasingly large, is the term -; an
x
infinitesimal?
SOL UTION:
By
the
definition
of
infinitesimal,
if -;
x
approaches 0 as x increases in value, then -; is an infinitesimal.

an
infinitesimal.

EXAMPLE: As x approaches 2, is the expressionr -i - 4 an
x-
infinitesimal?
SOL UTION: By the converse of the definition of infinitesimal,
if the difference between x
2
- i and 4 approaches 0, as x
x-
approaches 2, the expression x
2
- i-4 is an infinitesimal. By
x-
direct substitution we find an indeterminate form; therefore, we
make use of our knowledge of indeterminates and write

SUMS
An infinitesimal is a variable that
approaches 0 as a limit. We state that
(
and
d,
in
figure
4-2,
are
in-
finitesimals because they both ap-
proach 0 as shown.
Theorem 1. The algebraic sum of
any number of infinitesimals is an
infinitesimal.
In figure 4-2, as (and d approach
0, notice that their sum approaches
0;
by
definition
this
sum
is
an
infinitesimal. This approach may be
used for the sum of any number of
infinitesimals.
PRODUCTS
Theorem 2. The product of any
number of infinitesima/s is an in-
finitesimal.
In figure 4-3, the product of two
infinitesimals, ( and d,
is an in-
finitesimal as shown. The product of
any number of infinitesimals is also
an infinitesimal by the same approach
as shown for two numbers.
Theorem 3. The product of a
constant and an infinitesimal is an
infinitesimal.
This may be shown, in figure 4-3,
by holding either ( or d constant and
noticing their product as the variable
approaches O.

CONCLUSIONS
The term infinitesimal was used to describe the term Ax as it
approaches zero. The quantity Ax was called an increment of x,
where an increment was used to imply that we made a change in
x. Thus x + Ax indicates that we are holding x constant and
changing x by a variable amount which we will call Ax.
A very small increment is sometimes called a differential. A
small Ax is indicated by dx. The differential of fJ is dfJ and that
of y is dy. The limit of Ax as it approaches zero is, of course,
zero; but that does not mean the ratio of two infinitesimals can-
not be a real number or a real function of x. For instance, no
matter how small Ax is chosen, the ratio :
will still be
equal to 1.
In the section on indeterminate forms, a method for evaluating
the form§was shown. This form results whenever the limit takes
the form of one infinitesimal over another. In every case the limit
was a real number.
DISCONTINUITIES
The discussion of discontinuties will be based on a comparison
to continuity.
A function, f(x) , is continuous at x = a if the following three
conditions are met:
1. f(x) is defined at x =
a.
2. The limit of f(x) exists as x approaches a or x-a.
3. The value of f(x) at x = a is equal to the limit of f(x)
at x = a or lim f(x) = f(a).
x_a
If a function f(x) is not continuous at
x=a
then it is said to be discontinuous at
x=a
4-16

We will use examples to show the above statements.
EXAMPLE: In figure 4-4, is the function
f(x) = X2 + X - 4
continuous at f(2)?
SOLUTION:
f(2) = 4 + 2 - 4
=2
and
lim x 2 + x - 4 = 2
x....2
and
lim f(x) = f(2)
x....2
Therefore, the curve is continuous at
x = 2
EXAMPLE: In figure 4-5, is the function
x 2
- 4
f(x) =
2
x-
continuous at f(2)?
SOLUTION:
f(2) is undefined at
x=2
and the function is therefore discontinuous at
x=2

However, by extending the original equation of
f(x) to read
f(x) =
4,x = 2
we will have a continuous function at
x=2
NOTE: The value of 4 at x = 2 was found by
factoring the numerator off(x) and then simplifying.
A common kind of discontinuity occurs when we
are dealing with the tangent function of an angle.
Figure 4-6 is the graph of the tangent as the angle
varies from 0
0 to 90
0
; that is, from 0 to ~. The
value of the tangent at ~ is undefined.
Thus the function is said to be discontinuous at ~.
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
In the following definitions of the functions, find
where the functions are discontinuous and then
extend the definitions so that the functions are
continuous:

INCREMENTS AND DIFFERENTIATION
In this section we will extend our discussion of limits and
examine the idea of the derivative, the basis of differential calculus.
We will assume we have a particular function of x, such that
If x is assigned the value 10, the corresponding value of y will
be (l0)2 or 100. Now, if we increase the value of x by 2, making
it 12, we may call this increase of 2 an increment or Ax. This results
in an increase in the value of y, and we may call this increase an
increment or Ay. From this we write
y + Ay = (x + AX)2
= (10 + 2)2
= 144
As x increases from 10 to 12, y increases from 100 to 144 so that
Ax = 2
Ay = 44
and
Ay _ 44 _ 22
Ax- 2 -
We are interested in the ratio ~~ because the limit of this
ratio as Ax approaches zero is the derivative of
y =f(x)
4-19

As you recall from the discussion of
limits, as I!J.x is made smaller, l!J.y gets
smaller also.
For
our
problem,
the
ratio ~~ approaches 20. This is shown in
table 4-1.
We may use a much simpler way to
find that the limit of ~~ as I!J.x approaches
zero is, in this case, equal to 20. We have
two equations
y + l!J.y = (x + I!J.X)2
and

By expanding the first equation so that
y +I!J.y = x2+ 2xI!J.x + (I!J.xy
and subtracting the second from this, we have
l!J.y = 2xI!J.x + (I!J.X)2
Dividing both sides of the equation by ax gives
~~ = 2x + ax
Now, taking the limit as ax approaches zero, gives
lim
l!J.y - 2x
b_O I!J.x-
Thus,

of y with respect to x. Other ways are

x = ~X_O I!J.x
4-20

Equation (1) has the advantage that it is exact and true for
all values of x. Thus if
x = 10
then
~ = 2(10) = 20
and if
x=3
then
~ = 2(3) = 6
This method for obtaining the derivative ofy with respect to
x is general and may be formulated as follows:
1. Set up the function of x as a function of (x + Ax) and
expand this function.
2. Subtract the original function ofx from the new function
of (x + Ax).
3. Divide both sides of the equation by Ax.
4. Take the limit of all the terms in the equation as Ax
approaches zero. The resulting equation is the derivative
off(x) with respect to x.
GENERAL FORMULA
To obtain a formula for the derivative of any expression in
x, assume the function
y =f(x)
so that
y + Ay = f(x + Ax)
Subtracting equation (4.2) from equation (4.3) gives
Ay = f(x + Ax) - f(x)
4-21
(4.2)
(4.3)

and dividing both sides of the equation by Ax, we have
Ay
f(x + Ax) - f(x)
fJ.x
Ax
The desired formula is obtained by taking the limit of both sides
as Ax approaches zero so that
lim
Ay = lim f(x + Ax) - f(x)
.ix_O Ax
.1x_O
Ax
or
dy = lim f(x + Ax) - f(x)
dx
Ax_O
Ax
NOTE: The notation*is not to be considered as a fraction
in which dy is the numerator and dx is the denominator. The
expression ~~ is a fraction with Ay as its numerator and Ax as
its denominator. Whereas, e:tx is a symbol representing the limit
approached by ~~ as Ax approaches zero.
EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENTIATION
In this last section of the chapter, we will use several examples
of differentiation to obtain a firm understanding of the general
formula.
EXAMPLE: Find the derivative, e:tx, for the function
y = 5x3 -
3x + 2

SOLUTION: Finding the derivative by
formula, we have
f(x + Ax)
= 5(x + Ax)3 - 3(x + Ax) + 2
(1)
and
y
Dividing both sides by Ax, we have
f(x + Ax) - f(x)
f(x + Ax) - f(x)

Thus we have a new method of graphing
an equation. By substituting different values
of x in equation (3), we can find the slope
of the tangent line to the curve at the point
corresponding to the value of x. The graph
of the curve is shown in figure 4-7, view A.

EXAMPLE: Differentiate the function; that is, find ~ of

Now take the limit of both sides as Ax-O so that

dx = x 2
To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point
where x has the value 2, substitute 2 for x in the expression for~.
EXAMPLE: Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve
f(x) = x 2 + 4
at
x=3
4-24

SOLUTION: We need to find ~, which is the slope of the
tangent line at a given point. Apply the formula for the
derivative as follows:
f(x + Ax) = (x + AX)2 + 4
and
f(x) = x 2 + 4
Expand equation (1) so that
f(x + Ax) = x 2+ 2xAx + (AX)2 + 4
Then subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
f(x + Ax) - f(x) = 2xAx + (AX)2
Now, divide both sides by Ax:
f(x + AA1- f(x) = 2x + Ax
Then take the limit of both sides as Ax-O:
(1)
(2)
Substitute 3 for x in the expression for the derivative to find the
slope of the tangent line at
x=3
so that
slope = 6
In this last example we will set the derivative of the function,
f(x), equal to zero and determine the values of the independent
variable that will make the derivative equal to zero to find a
maximum or minimum point on the curve. By maximum or
minimum of a curve, we mean the point or points through which
the slope of the tangent line to the curve changes from positive
to negative or from negative to positive.
4-25

NOTE: When the derivative of a function is set equal
to zero, that does not mean in all cases we will have
found a maximum or minimum point on the curve. A
complete discussion of maxima or minima may be found in most
calculus texts.
To set the derivative equal to zero, we will require that the
following conditions be met:
1. We have a maximum or minimum point.
2. The derivative exists.
3. We are dealing with an interior point on the curve.
When these conditions are met, the derivative of the function
will be equal to zero.
EXAMPLE: Find the derivative of the function
y = 5x3 – 6x2 – 3x + 3
set the derivative equal to zero, and find the points of maximum
and minimum on the curve. Then verify this by drawing the graph
of the curve.
SOLUTION: Apply the formula for dy as follows:
dx
f(x + ∆x) = 5(x + ∆x)3 – 6(x + ∆x)2 – 3(x + ∆x) + 3
(1)
and
f(x) = 5x3 – 6x2 – 3x + 3
(2)
Expand equation (1) and subtract equation (2), obtaining
f(x + ∆x) – f(x) =
5(3x2∆x + 3x∆x2 + ∆x3) – 6(2x∆x + ∆x2) – 3∆x
Now, divide both sides by ∆x, and take the limit as ∆x→0 so that
= 15x2 – 12x – 3

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
1. Definition of a limit: Let f(x) be defined for all x in the
interval near x = a. Then there exists a number, L, such that for
every positive number
£, however small, If(x) - L I< £,
provided that we may find a positive number 0 such
that 0 < I x - a I< o. Then we say L is the limit of f(x) as x
approaches a, and we write lim f(x) = L. This means that
for every given number £ > 0, we must find a number d such
that the difference between f(x) and L is smaller than the
number £ whenever 0 < I x - a 1< o.
2. Indeterminate forms:
Two methods of evaluating indeterminate forms are (1) fac-
toring and (2) division of the numerator and denominator by
powers of the variable.
3. Limit theorems:
Theorem 1. The limit ofthe sum of two functions is equal to
the sum of the limits:
lim If(x) + g(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x)
x_a

This theorem can be extended to include any number of
functions, such as
lim If(x) + g(x) + h(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x) + lim h(x)

Theorem 3. The limit ofthe product oftwo functions is equal
to the product of their limits:

is not equal to zero:

4. Infinitesimals: A variable that approaches 0 as a limit is called
an infinitesimal:
lim V = 0 or V-O
The
difference
between
a
variable
and
its
limit
is
an
infinitesimal:
If lim V = L, then lim V - L = 0
5. Sum and product of infinitesimals:
Theorem 1. The algebraic sum ofany nurnber ofinfinitesimals
is an infinitesimal.
Theorem 2. The product of any number of infinitesimals is
an infinitesimal.
Theorem 3. The product of a constant and an infinitesimal
is an infinitesimal.
6. Continuity: A function, f(x) , is continuous at x = a if the
following three conditions are met:
1. I(x) is defined at x = a.
2. The limit of I(x) exists as x approaches a or x-a.
3. The value of f(x)
at x = a is equal to the limit of
f(x) at x = a or lim f(x) = f(a).
7. Discontinuity: If a function is not continuous at x = a,
then it is said to be discontinuous at x = a.

Increment method for obtaining the derivative of y with
respect to x:
1. Set up the function of x as a function of (x + ax) and
expand this function.
2. Subtract the original
function of x
from
the new
function of (x + ax).
3. Divide both sides of the equation by ax.
4. Take the limit of all the terms in the equation as ax
approaches zero. The resulting equation is the derivative
of f(x) with respect to x.
10. General formula for the derivative of any expression in x:
dy = lim f(x + ax) - f(x)

11. Maximum or minimum points on a curve: Set the derivative of
the function, f(x), equal to zero and determine the values
of the independent variable that will make the derivative
equal to zero. (Note: When the derivative of a function is
set equal to zero, that does not mean in all cases the curve
will have a maximum or minimum point.)

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter on limits, we used the delta process
to find the limit of a function as Ax approached zero. We called
the result of this tedious and, in some cases, lengthy process the
derivative. In this chapter we will examine some rules used to find
the derivative of a function without using the delta process.
To find how y changes as x changes, we take the limit of
~ as Ax-O and write

Ay

Ax_O Ax

which is called the derivative of y with respect to x; we use the
symbol ~ to indicate the derivative and write
lim Ay = dy
Ax....O Ax
dx
In this section we will learn a number of rules that will enable
us to easily obtain the derivative of many algebraic functions. In
the derivation of these rules, which will be called theorems, we will
assume that

exists and is finite.
DERIVATIVE OF A CONSTANT
The method we will use to find the derivative of a constant
is similar to the delta process used in the previous chapter but in-
cludes an analytical proof. A diagram is used to give a geometrical
meaning of the function.
Theorem 1. The derivative of a constant is
zero. Expressed as a formula, this may be written
as

where c is a constant t the value of y is the same for all values of
X t and any change in x (that iS t Ax) does not affect y; then
ay = c - c = 0

and
Another way of stating this is that when x is equal to Xl and when
x is equal to Xl + Axt y has the same value. Therefore t

y + ay = c

The equation

represents a straight line parallel to the X axis. The slope of this
line will be zero for all values of x. Therefore t the derivative is
zero for all values of x.

DERIVATIVES OF VARIABLES
In this section of variables, we will extend the theorems of
limits covered previously. Recall that a derivative is actually a limit.
The proof of the theorems presented here involve the delta process.

SOLUTION:
f(x) = ax
and
f(x + Ax) = a(x + Ax)

INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Theorem 7. The derivative of an inverse function is equal to
the reciprocal of the derivative of the direct function.
In the equations to this point, x has been the independent
variable and Y has been the dependent variable. The equations
have been in a form such as
Y = x
2 + 3x + 2
Suppose that we have a function like
1

x = y 2 - Y
and we wish to find the derivative ~. Notice that if we solve for
y in terms of x, using the quadratic formula, we get the more com-
plicated function:

If we call this function the direct function, then

IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS
In equations containing x and y, separating the variables is
not always easy. If we do not solve an equation for y, we call y
an implicit function of x. In the equation
x2 -
4y = 0
y is an implicit function of x, and x is also called an implicit func-
tion of y. If we solve this equation for y, that is
then y would be called an explicit function of x. In many cases
such a solution would be far too complicated to handle
conveniently.
When y is given by an equation such as
y is an implicit function of x.
Whenever we have an equation of this type in which y is an
implicit function of x, we can differentiate the function in a
straightforward manner. The derivative of each term containing y
will be followed by ~. Refer to Theorem 6.
EXAMPLE: Obtain the derivative ez of

the
derivative will usually contain terms in both x and y.

CHAPTER 6
INTEGRATION
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:
1. Define integration.
2. Find the area under a curve and interpret indefinite integrals.
3. Apply rules of integration.
4. Apply definite integrals to problem solving.
INTRODUCTION
The two main branches of calculus are differential calculus
and integral calculus. Having studied differential calculus in
previous chapters, we now turn our attention to integral calculus.
Basically, integration is the inverse of differentiation just as divi-
sion is the inverse of multiplication, and as subtraction is the in-
verse of addition.
DEFINITIONS
Integration is defined as the inverse of differentiation. When
we were dealing with differentiation, we were given a function
F(x) and were required to find the derivative of this function. In
integration we will be given the derivative of a function and will
be required to find the function. That is, when we are given the
function j(x), we will find another function, F(x), such that
ixF(X) = f(x)
6-1
(6.1)

In other words, when we have the functionf(x), we must find the
function F(x) whose derivative is the function f(x).
If we change equation (6.1) to read
d F(x) = f(x) dx
(6.2)
we have used dx as a differential. An equivalent statement for
equation (6.2) is
F(x) = Jf(x) dx
We callJtx) the integrand, and we say F(x) is equal to the indefinite
integral of f(x). The elongated S,f, is the integral sign. This sym-
bol is used because integration may be shown to be the limit of
a sum.

We will use the area under a curve for the inter-
pretation of an integral. You should realize, however,
that an integral may represent many things, and it
may be real or abstract. It may represent the plane
area, volume, or surface area of some figure.
AREA UNDER A CURVE
To find the area under a curve, we must agree
on what is desired. In figure 6-1, where/ex) is equal
to the constant 4 and the "curve" is the straight line
y=4
Hgure 6-1.-Area of a rectangle.
the area of the rectangle is found by multiplying the
height times the width. Thus, the area under the curve
is
A = 4(b - a)
The next problem is to find a method for deter-
mining the area under any curve, provided that the
curve is continuous. In figure 6-2, the area under the
curve
I:!. A
-f-----l-----'---x
y =/(x)
o
x
between points x and x + Ax is approximately f(x)Ax.
We consider that Ax is small and the area given is M.
Figure 6-2.-Area M.
6-2

This area under the curve is nearly a rectangle. The
area M, under the curve, would differ from the area
of the rectangle by the area of the triangle ABC if
AC were a straight line.
When Ax becomes smaller and smaller, the area
of ABC becomes smaller at a faster rate, and ABC
finally becomes indistinguishable from a triangle.
The area of this triangle becomes negilible when Ax
is sufficiently small. Therefore, for sufficiently small
values of Ax, we can say that
y
Figure 6-3.-Area of strips.
M-;:;f(x)Ax
Now, if we have the curve in figure 6-3, the sum
of all the rectangles will be approximately equal to
the area under the curve and bounded by the lines
at a and b. The difference between the actual area
under the curve and the sum of the areas of the rec-
tangles will be the sum of the areas of the triangles
above each rectangle.
As Ax is made smaller and smaller, the sum of the rectangular
areas will approach the value of the area under the curve. The
sum of the areas of the rectangles may be indicated by
Q
b
n
A = lim
L f(xk)Ax
n-oo k = 1
(6.3)
where 2 (sigma) is the symbol for sum, n is the number of rec-
tangles, f(x)Ax is the area of each rectangle, and k is the designa-
tion number of each rectangle. In the particular example just
discussed, where we have four rectangles, we would write
and we would have only the sum of four rectangles and not the
limiting area under the curve.
When using the limit of a sum, as in equation (6.3), we are
required to use extensive algebraic techniques to find the actual
area under the curve.
To this point we have been given a choice of using arithmetic
and finding only an approximation of the area under a curve or
using extensive algebra to find the actual area.
We will now use calculus to find the area under a curve fairly
easily.
6-3

In figure 6-4, the areas under the curve, from a
to b, is shown as the sum of the areas of aAc and
cAb. The notation aAc means the area under the curve
from a to c.
The Intermediate Value Theorem states that
aAb =j(c) (b - a)
where j(c) in figure 6-4 is the value of the function
at an intermediate point between a and b.
We now modify figure 6-4 as shown in figure 6-5.
When
x=a
then
We see in figure 6-5 that
therefore, the increase in area, as shown, is
AA = xA(x+.Ax)
Reference to figure 6-5 shows
xA(x+.Ax) =j(c) (x + Ax - x) =j(c)Ax

and as Ax approaches zero, we have
!L(A) = lim AA
dx
Ax_O Ax

Now, from the definition of integration
aAx = I f(x) dx
= F(x) + C
where C is the constant of integration, and
aAa = F(a) + C
but
therefore,
F(a) + C = 0
By solving for C, we have
C = -F(a)
and by substituting - F(a) into equation (6.4), we find
aAx = F(x) - F(a)
If we let
x=b
then
(6.4)
aAb = F(b) - F(a)
(6.5)
where F(b) and F(a) are the integrals of the function of the curve
at the values band a.
The constant of integration C is omitted in equation (6.5)
because when the function of the curve at b and a is integrated,
C will occur with both F(a) and F(b) and will therefore be sub-
tracted from itself.
NOTE: The concept of the constant of integration is more fully
explained later in this chapter.

aAb = F(b) - F(a)
and we find that
F(x) = Jf(x) dx
= J(2x -

= x2 - x (This step will be justified later.)
Then, substituting the values for a and b into
F(x) = x2 - x, we find that when

Then by substituting these values in
aAb = F(b) - F(a)
we find that
aAb = 20 - 0
= 20

Figure 6-6.-Area of triangle and rectangle.

We may verify this by considering figure 6-6 to be a triangle with
base 4 and height 8 sitting on a rectangle of height 1 and base
4. By known formulas, we find the area under the curve to be 20.
INDEFINITE INTEGRALS
When we were finding the derivative of a function, we
wrote
ixF(X) = fix)
where the derivative of F(x) is f(x). Our problem is to find F(x)
when we are given fix).
We know that the symbol J . . . dx is the inverse of
ix, or when dealing with differentials, the operator symbols d
and J are the inverse of each other; that is,
F(x) = Jfix) dx
and when the derivative of each side is taken, d annulling J, we
have
.
d F(x) = f(x) dx
d
or where J . . . dx annuals dx' we have
IxF(X) = IxJf(x) dx
=f(x)
From this, we find that
so that,
Also we find that
d (x3 + 3) = 3x2 dx
6-7

so that,
Again, we find that
d (X 3
-
9) = 3x2 dx
so that,
This is to say that
and
where C is any constant of integration.
A number that is independent of the variable of integration
is called a constant of integration. Since C may have infinitely
many values, then a differential expression may have infinitely
many integrals differing only by the constant. This is to say that
two integrals of the same function may differ by the constant of
integration. We assume the differential expression has at least one
integral. Because the integral contains C and C is indefinite,
we call
F(x) + C
an indefinite integral of f(x) dx.
In the general form we
say
ff(x) dx = F(x) + C
With regard to the constant of integration, a theorem and its
converse are stated as follows:
Theorem 1. If two functions differ by a constant, they have
the same derivative.
Theorem 2. If two functions have the same derivative, their
difference is a constant.

RULES FOR INTEGRATION
Although integration is the inverse of differentiation and we
were given rules for differentiation, we are required to determine
the answers in integration by trial and error. However, there are
some rules to aid us in the determination of the answer.
In this section we will discuss four of these rules and how they
are used to integrate standard elementary forms. In the rules we
will let u and v denote a differentiable function of a variable such
as x. We will let C, n, and a denote constants.
Our proofs will involve searching for a function F(x) whose
derivative is f(x) dx.
Rule 1. Jdu = u + C
The integral ofa differential ofafunction is the function plus
a constant.
PROOF: If
!L(u + C) - 1
du

then
d (u + C) = du
and
Jdu = u + C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate the integral
Jdx
SOLUTION: By Rule 1, we have
Jdx=x+ C
Rule 2.
Ja du = a Jdu = au + C
A constant may be moved across the integral sign. NOTE: A
variable may NOT be moved across the integral sign.
PROOF: If
!L(au + C) _ ( )!L(u + C) _

then
d (au + C) = a d (u + C) = a du
and
Ja du = aJdu = au + C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate the integral
J4 dx
SOL UTION: By Rule 2,
J4 dx = 4 Jdx
and by Rule 1,
Jdx=x+ C
therefore,
J4 dx = 4x + C
Rule 3. f

Un du =-- + C

The integral of un du may be obtained by adding 1 to the ex-
ponent and then dividing by this new exponent. NOTE: If n is
minus 1, this rule is not valid and another method must be used.

The integral of a sum is equal to the sum of the integrals.

d (u + v + w + C) = du + dv + dw
then
f (du + dv + dw) = (u + C l ) + (v + C2)
+ (w + C3)
such that
f (du + dv + dw) = u + v + w + C

Now we will discuss the evaluation of the constant of
integration.
If we are to find the equation of a curve whose first derivative
is 2 times the independent variable x, we may write
or
dy = 2x dx
6-12
(1)

We may obtain the desired equation for the curve by integrating
the expression for dy; that is, by integrating both sides of equa-
tion (1). If
dy = 2x dx
then,
Jdy = f2x dx
But, since
Jdy =y

and
we may obtain a specific value for C and hence a par-
ticular curve.
y=x2 +C
We have obtained only a general equation of the
curve because a different curve results for each value
we assign to C. This is shown in figure 6-7. If we
specify that

C=6
Figure 6-7.-Family of curves.
By substituting the value 6 into the general equation, we find that
the equation for the particular curve is
y = x 2 + 6
which is curve C of figure 6-7.
6-13

The values for x and y will determine the value for C and also
determine the particular curve of the family of curves.
In figure 6-7, curve A has a constant equal to - 4, curve B
has a constant equal to 0, and curve C has a constant equal to 6.
EXAMPLE: Find the equation of the curve if its first
derivative is 6 times the independent variable, y equals 2, and x
equals O.
SOLUTION: We may write

J dy = J6x dx
such that,
y = 3x2 + C
Solving for C when
x=O
and
y=2
we have

DEFINITE INTEGRALS
The general form of the indefinite integral is
I f(x) dx = F(x) + C
6-15

and has two identifying characteristics. First, the constant of
integration must be added to each integration. Second, the
result of integration is a function of a variable and has
no
definite
value,
even
after
the
constant of integration
is
determined,
until
the
variable
is
asigned
a
numerical
value.
The definite integral eliminates these two characteristics.
The form of the definite integral is
J: f(x) dx = [F(b) + C] - [F(a) + C]
(6.6)
= F(b) - F(a)
where a and b are given values. Notice that the constant
of integration does not appear in the final expression of
equation (6.6). In words, this equation states that the difference of
the values of
J: f(x) dx
for
x=a
and
x=b
gives the area under the curve defined by f(x), the X axis, and
the ordinates where
x=a
and
x=b
6-16

In figure 6-8, the value of b is the upper
limit
and
the value of a is the lower limit.
These
upper
and
lower
limits
may
be
any
assigned values in the range of the curve. The
upper limit is positive with respect to the lower
limit in that it is located to the right (positive in our
case) of the lower limit.
Equation (6.6) is the limit of the sum of all
the
strips
between
a
and
b,
having
areas
of f(x)Ax; that is,
x - b

The notation F(x) I: in equation (6.7) means we first
substitute the upper limit, b, into the function F(x) to obtain F(b);
and from F(b) we subtract F(a), the value obtained by substituting
the lower limit, a, into F(x).

SOL UTION: Substituting into equation (6.7), we have
J: f(x) dx = F(x) I: = F(b) - F(a)
We may make an estimate of this solution by considering the area
desired in figure 6-9 as being a right triangle resting on a rectangle.
The triangle has an approximate area of

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
1. Definition of integration: Integration is defined as the inverse
of differentiation.
F(x) = Jf(x) dx
where F(x) is the function whose derivative is the functionf(x);
Jis the integral sign; f(x) is the integrand; and dx is the
differential.
2. Area under a curve:
n
A = lim
1:
f(xk)1lx
n-oo k = I
where 1: (sigma) is the symbol for sum, n is the number of rec-
tangles, f(x)1lx is the area of each rectangle, and k is the designa-
tion number of each rectangle.
Intermediate Value Theorem:
tAb =f(c)(b - a)
where f(c) is the function at an intermediate point between a
and b.
tAb = F(b) - F(a)
where F(b) - F(a) are the integrals of the function of the curve
at the values b and a.
3. Indefinite integrals:
Jf(x) dx = F(x) + C
where C is called a constant of integration, a number which
is independent of the variable of integration.
Theorem 1. If two functions differ by a constant, they have
the same derivative.
Theorem 2. If two functions have the same derivative, their
difference is a constant.
6-25

4. Rules for integration:
Rule 1. f du = u + C
The integral ofa differential ofafunction is the function plus
a constant.
Rule 2. f a du = a f du = au + C
A constant may be moved across the integral sign. NOTE: A
variable may NOT be moved across the integral sign.
f
un+ 1
Rule 3.
un du = n + 1 + C
The integral of un du may be obtained by adding 1 to the ex-
ponent and then dividing by this new exponent. NOTE: If n
is minus 1, this rule is not valid.
Rule 4. f (du + dv + dw) = f du + f dv + f dw
= u+v+w+C
The integral of a sum is equal to the sum of the integrals.
5. Definite integrals:
f : f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
where b, the upper limit, and a, the lower limit, are given
values.
6. Areas above and below a curve:
If the graph of y = f(x) , between x = a and x = b, has por-
tions above and portions below the X axis, then
f:f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) is the sum of the absolute values of
the positive areas above the X axis and the negative areas below
the X axis.

variable cubed, y equals 12, and x equals 2.

CHAPTER 7
INTEGRATION FORMULAS
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:
1. Integrate a variable to a power, a constant, a function raised
to a power, and a constant to a variable power.
2. Integrate the sum of differentiable functions, quotients, and
trigonometric functions.
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter several of the integration formulas and proofs
are discussed and examples are given. Some of the formulas from
the previous chapter are repeated because they are considered
essential for the understanding of integration. The formulas in
this chapter are basic and should not be considered a complete
collection of integration formulas. Integration is so complex that
tables of integrals have been published as reference sources.
In the following formulas and proofs, U, v, and ware con-
sidered functions of a single variable.
POWER OF A VARIABLE
The integral ofa variable to a power is the variable to a power
increased by one and divided by the new power.

CONSTANTS

sign.

SUMS
The integral of an algebraic sum of differentiable functions
is the same as the algebraic sum of the integrals of these func-
tions taken separately; that is, the integral of a sum is the sum
of the integrals.
Formula.
J (du + dv + dw) = J du + J dv + J dw
PROOF:
d (u + v + w + C) = du + dv + dw
7-3

Therefore,
Jdu + f dv + Jdw = u + C 1 + V + C 2 + W + C3
where
Then
f du + Jdv + f dw = u + v + w + C
and
J(du + dv + dw) = Jdu + Jdv + Jdw
=u+v+w+C

POWER OF A FUNCTION
The integral of a function raised to a power is found by the
following steps:
1. Increase the power of the function by 1.
2. Divide the result of step 1 by this increased power.
3. Add the constant of integration.
Formula.

du = 2 dx
7-6

Then by substitution,
Therefore,
f (2x -
3)2(2) dx = (2x 3" 3)3 + C
When you use this formula the integral must contain precisely
duo If the required constant in du is not present, it must be placed
in the integral and then compensation must be made.
EXAMPLE: Evaluate
I (3x + 5)6 dx
SOLUTION: Let
u = (3x + 5)
so that
du = 3 dx
We find dx in the integral but not 3 dx. A 3 must be included
in the integral to fulfill the requirements of du.
In words, this means the integral
I (3x + 5)6 dx
needs du so that the formula may be used.
Therefore, we write
~ f (3x + 5)6 dx
and recalling that a constant may be carried across the integral
sign, we write
~ f (3x + 5)6 dx = 1f (3x + 5)6(3) dx
7-7

Notice that we needed 3 in the integral for du, and we included
3 in the integral; we then compensated for the 3 by multiplying
the integral by 1/3.

QUOTIENT
In this
section three methods of integrating quotients
are discussed) but only the second method will be proven.
The first method is to put the quotient into the form
of the power of a function.
The second method results
in
operations
with
logarithms.
The
third method is a
special case in
which
the quotient must be simplified
to use the sum rule.

METHOD 1
If we are given the integral
J(9 - ~2)1/2 dx
we observe that this integral may be written as
By letting
then
du = -8x dx
The only requirement for this to fit the form
fun du
is the factor for du of - 4. We accomplish this by multiplying
2x dx by - 4, giving - 8x dx, which is duo We then compensate
for the factor - 4 by multiplying the integral by - 1/4.
Therefore,
J(9 - ~2)1/2 dx = J2x(9 - 4x2fl/2 dx
= - iI(- 4) (2x) (9 - 4x2fl/2 dx

fulfilled the requirements for

METHOD 3
In the third method for solving integrals of quotients, we find
that to integrate an algebraic function with a numerator that is
not of lower degree than its denominator, we proceed as follows:
Change the integrand into a polynomialplus afraction by dividing
the denominator into the numerator. After this is accomplished,
apply the rules available.

variable power is presented. The two forms are e" and a", where
u is a variable, a is any constant, and e is a defined constant.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Trigonometric functions,
which comprise one group of
transcendental
functions,
may
be
differentiated
and
inte-
grated
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
other
functions.
We
will limit our proofs to the sine, cosine, and secant functions
but will list several others.
Formula.
I sin u du = - cos u + C
PROOF:
d (cos u + C) = - sin u du
and
d ( - cos u + C) = sin u du
Therefore,
Jsin u du = - cos u + C
Formula.
I cos u du = sin u + C
PROOF:
d (sin u + C) = cos u du
Therefore,
I cos u du = sin u + C
Formula.
I sec
2u du = tan u + C
PROOF:
d (tan u + C) = d (sm u + c)
cos u
7-24

and by the quotient rule
d (Sin u + c) = (cos u) (cos u) - (sin u) (- sin u) du
cos U
cos2u
Therefore,
Jsec2u du = tan u + C
To this point we have considered integrals of trigonometric
functions that result in functions of the sine, cosine, and tangent.
Those integrals that result in functions of the cotangent, secant,
and cosecant are included in the following list of elementary
integrals:
Jsin u du =
- cos u + c
Jcos u du = sin u + C
Jsec
2u du = tan u + C
Jcsc 2u du = - cot u + c
Jsec u tan u du = sec u + C
Jcsc u cot u du = - csc u + C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate
Jsin 3x dx
SOLUTION: We need the integral in the form of
Jsin u du =
- cos u + C
We let
u = 3x
so that
du = 3 dx
7-25

but we do not have 3 dx. Therefore, we multiply the integral by
3/3 and rearrange as follows:
J sin 3x dx = ~ J 3 sin 3x dx
= t J sin
u du
1
= 3( - cos u) + C
1
=
- 3 cos 3x + C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate
Jcos (2x + 4) dx
SOLUTION: Let
u = (2x + 4)
so that
du = 2 dx
Therefore,
Jcos (2x + 4) dx = ~ Jcos (2x + 4) 2 dx
=! J cos u du
1.
C

EXAMPLE: Evaluate
J(3 sin 2x + 4 cos 3x) dx
7-26

SOLUTION: We use the rule for sums and write
J(3 sin 2x + 4 cos 3x) dx
= J3 sin 2x dx + J4 cos 3x dx
Then, in the integral
J3 sin 2x dx
let
u = 2x
so that
du = 2 dx
but we have
3 dx
Hence, proper compensation has to be made as follows:
J3 sin 2x dx = 3 J sin 2x dx
= 3(!) f 2 sin 2x dx
=! f sin u du
3
= 2( - cos u) + C 1

= - 2. cos 2x + C 1
7-27

The second integral
J4 cos 3x dx
with
u = 3x
and
du = 3 dx
is evaluated as follows:
J 4 cos 3x dx = 1 J 3 cos 3x dx
= 1 Jcos u du
= 1(sin u) + Cz
= 1(sin 3x) + C2
Then, by combining the two solutions, we have
J (3 sin 2x + 4 cos 3x) dx
=
- ~ cos 2x + C1 + 1 sin 3x + Cz
=
- ~ cos 2x +1sin 3x + C
where
C 1 + Cz = C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate
Jsecz5x dx
SOLUTION: Let
u = 5x
so that
du = 5 dx
7-28

We need 5 dx so we write
= ~(tan u) + C
= !<tan 5x) + C
EXAMPLE: Evaluate
Jesc 2x cot 2x dx
SOLUTION: Let
u = 2x
so that
du = 2 dx
We require du equal to 2 dx, so we write
Jesc 2x cot 2x dx = ~ J2 esc 2x cot 2x dx
= ~ Jesc u cot u du

= 2:< - esc u) + C

CHAPTER 8
COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to do
the following:
1. Define combinations and permutations.
2. Apply the concept of combinations to problem solving.
3. Apply the concept of principle of choice to problem solving.
4. Apply the concept of permutations to problem solving.
INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with concepts required for the study of
probability and statistics. Statistics is a branch of science that is
an outgrowth of the theory of probability. Combinations and per-
mutations are used in both statistics and probability; and they,
in turn, involve operations with factorial notation. Therefore,
combinations, permutations, and factorial notation are dis-
cussed in this chapter.
DEFINITIONS
A combination is defined as a possible selection of a certain
number of objects taken from a group without regard to order.
For instance, suppose we were to choose two letters from a group
of three letters. If the group of three letters were A, B, and C,
we
could
choose
the
letters
in
combinations of two
as
follows:
AB, AC, BC
8-1

The order in which we wrote the letters is of no concern; that is,
AB could be written BA, but we would still have only one com-
bination of the letters A and B.
A permutation is defined as a possible selection of a certain
number of objects taken from a group with regard to order. The
permutations of two letters from the group of three letters would
be as follows:
AB, A C, Be, BA, CA, CB
The symbol used to indicate the foregoing combination will be
3CZ , meaning a group of three objects taken two at a time. For
the previous permutation we will use 3P2, meaning a group of three
objects taken two at a time and ordered.
You will need an understanding of factorial notation before
we begin a detailed discussion of combinations and permutations.
We define the product of the integers n through 1 as n factorial
and use the symbol n! to denote this; that is,
3!=3·2·1
6! =6·5·4·3·2·1
n! = n· (n - 1) ... 3·2 -1
EXAMPLE: Find the value of 5!
SOLUTION:
5! = 5·4-3-2-1
= 120
EXAMPLE: Find the value of
5!
3!
SOLUTION:
5! =5·4-3·2·1
and
3! = 3·2·1
Then
8-2

and by simplification
5-4-3-2-1
3-2-1=5-4
= 20
The previous example could have been solved by writing
5!
5 -4-3!
3! =
3!
= 5-4
Notice that we wrote
5! =5-4-3-2-1
and combine the factors
3-2-1
as
3!
so that
5!=5-4-3!
EXAMPLE: Find the value of
6! - 4!
4!
SOLUTION:
6! = 6-5-4!
and
4! = 4! -1
Then
6! - 4!
(6 -5 - 1) 4!
4!
-
4!
=(6-5-1)
= 29
8-3

Notice that 4! was factored from the expression
6! - 4!
Theorem. If nand r are positive integers, with n greater than
r, then
n! = (n)(n -
1) ... (r + 2)(r + l)r!
This theorem allows us to simplify an expression as follows:
5!=5'4!
= 5·4·3!
= 5·4·3·2!
=5·4·3·2'1
Another example is
(n + 2)! = (n + 2)(n + I)!
= (n + 2)(n + I)(n!)
= (n + 2)(n + I)(n) ... 1
EXAMPLE: Simplify
(n + 3)!
n!
SOLUTION:
(n + 3)! = (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + l)n!
then
(n + 3)! _ (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + l)n!
n!
-
n!
= (n + 3)(n + 2)(n + 1)

COMBINATIONS
As indicated previously, a combination is the selection of a
certain number of objects taken from a group of objects without
regard to order. We use the symbol sC3 to indicate that we have
five objects taken three at a time, without regard to order. Using
the letters A, B, C, D, and E to designate the five objects, we
list the combinations as follows:
ABC ABD ABE ACD ACE
ADE BCD BCE BDE CDE
8-5

We find 10 combinations of 5 objects are taken 3 at a time.
The word combinations implies that order is not considered.
EXAMPLE: Suppose we wish to know how many color com-
binations can be made from four different colored marbles if we
use only three marbles at a time. The marbles are colored red,
green, white, and yellow.
SOL UTION: We let the first letter in each word indicate the
color; then we list the possible combinations as follows:
RGW RGY RWY GWY
If we rearrange the groups, for example RG W, to form GWR or
R WG, we still have the same color combination within each group;
therefore, order is not important.
The previous examples are relatively easy to understand; but
suppose we have 20 boys and wish to know how many different
basketball teams we could form, one at a time, from these boys.
Our listing would be quite lengthy, and we would have a difficult
task to determine we had all of the possible combinations. In fact,
we would have to list over 15,000 combinations. This indicates
the need for a formula.
The general formula for possible combinations of r objects
from a group of n objects is
c
= _n(.o-n_-_1L-)_._.-:;:-'(-'--::n:------:;--r_+-----<...l)
n
T
r"
.3.2'1
The denominator may be written as
r' . ·3· 2·1 = r!
and if we multiply both numerator and denominator by
(n - r) ... 2·1
which is
(n - r)!
we have
n(n - 1)' . . (n - r + 1)(n - r) . . . 2· 1
C=------>...-~'--------:-~-...,.---~---,---'----
n
T
r! (n - r) . . . 2· 1
8-6

The numerator
n(n - 1) . . . (n - r + 1)(n - r) . . . 2· 1
IS
n!
Therefore,
n!
nCr = r!(n - r)!
This formula is read: The number of combinations of n objects
taken r at a time is equal to n factorial divided by rfactorial times
n minus r factorial.
EXAMPLE: In the previous problem where 20 boys were
available, how many different basketball teams could be formed?
SOLUTION: If the choice of which boy played center, guard,
or forward is not considered, we find the number of combina-
tions of 20 boys taken 5 at a time by writing
C
=
n!
n
r
r!(n - r)!
where
n = 20
and
r=5
Then, by substitution, we have
20!
nCr = 20CS = 5!(20 - 5)!

EXAMPLE: A man has, in his pocket, a silver dollar, a half-
dollar, a quarter, a dime, a nickel, and a penny. If he reaches
into his pocket and pulls out three coins, how many different sums
may he have?
SOLUTION: The order is not important; therefore, the
number of combinations of coins possible is

This seems to violate the rule, division by zero is not allowed,
but we define O! to equal 1.

PRINCIPLE OF CHOICE
The principle of choice is discussed in relation to combina-
tions, although it is also discussed later in this chapter in relation
to permutations. It is stated as follows:
Ifa selection can be made in n 1 ways; and after this selection is
made, a second selection can be made in n2 ways; and after this
selection is made, a third selection can be made in n3 ways; and so
forth for r selections, then the r selections can be made together in
EXAMPLE: In how many ways can a coach choose first a
football team and then a basketball team from 18 boys?
SOLUTION: First let the coach choose a football team; that is,
18!
ISC l1 = 11!(18 - II)!
18!
= 11 !7!
18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11!
=
11!7-6-5-4'3-2-1
= 31,824
The coach now must choose a basketball team from the remain-
ing seven boys; that is,
7!
7C S = 5!(7 - 5)!
7!
= 5!2!
7-6-5!
5!2!
7-6
= T
= 21
Then, together, the two teams can be chosen in
(31,824)(21) = 668,304 ways
8-10

The same answer would be achieved if the coach chose the basket-
ball team first and then the football team; that is,
18!
13!
ISCS '13C1 \ = 5!13! ' 11!2!
= (8,568)(78)
= 668,304
which is the same number as before.
EXAMPLE: A woman ordering dinner has a choice of one
meat dish from four, four vegetables from seven, one salad from
three, and one dessert from four. How many different menus are
possible?
SOLUTION: The individual combinations are as follows:
meat
4C1
vegetable
7C4
salad
3C\
dessert
4C\
The values of these combinations are
4!
4C1 = 1!(4 - I)!
4!
- 3!
=4
and
7!
7C4 = 4!(7 - 4)!
7!
4!3!
7,6,5
-
3·2
= 35
and
3!
3C1 = 1!(3 - I)!
3!
- 2!
=3
8-11

Therefore, the woman has a choice of
(4)(35)(3)(4) = 1,680
different menus.

in a division that must furnish 2 second class and 6 third
class petty officers for shore patrol, how many different

1. 3,410,880
2. 27,720
3. 19,110
PERMUTATIONS
Permutations are similar to combinations but extend the re-
quirements of combinations by considering order.
8-12

Suppose we have two letters, A and B,
and
wish
to
know
how
many
ar-
rangements of these letters can be made.
Obviously the answer is two; that is,

We had three choices for the first letter;

Figure 8-1.-"Tree" diagram.
the second letter, we had only one choice.
This is shown in the "tree" diagram in
figure 8-1. Notice that a total of six dif-
ferent paths lead to the ends of the "bran-
ches" of the "tree" diagram.
If the number of objects is large, the tree would become very
complicated; therefore, we approach the problem in another man-
ner, using parentheses to show the possible choices. Suppose we
were to arrange six objects in as many different orders as possi-
ble. For the first choice we have six objects:
AB and BA
If we extend this to the three letters A, B,
and C, we find the answer to be
(6)( )( )( )( )( )
For the second choice we have only five choices:
(6)(5)( )( )( )( )
For the third choice we have only four choices:
(6)(5)(4)( )( )( )
This may be continued as follows:
(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)
By applying the principle of choice, we find the total possible ways
of arranging the objects to be the product of the individiual
choices; that is,
6·5·4·3·2·1
and this may be written as
6!
8-13

This leads to the statement: The number of permutations of
n objects taken all together is equal to n!.
EXAMPLE: How many permutations of seven different
letters may be made?
SOLUTION: We could use a "tree" diagram, but this would
become complicated. (Try it to see why.) We could use the paren-
theses as follows:
(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 5040
The easiest solution is to use the previous statement and
write
that is, the number of possible arrangements of seven objects taken
seven at a time is 7!.
NOTE: Compare this with the number of combinations of
seven objects taken seven at a time.
If we are faced with finding the number of permutations of
seven objects taken three at a time, we use three parentheses as
follows:
In the first position we have a choice of seven objects:
(7)( )( )
In the second position we have a choice of six objects:
(7)(6)( )
In the last position we have a choice of five objects:
(7)(6)(5)
Therefore by principle of choice, the solution is
7,6'5=210
At this point we will use our knowledge of combinations to
develop a formula for the number of permutations of n objects
taken r at a time.
8-14

Suppose we wish to find the number of permutations of five
things taken three at a time. We first determine the number of
groups of three as follows:
5!
sC3 = 3!(5 - 3)!
5!
= 3!2!
= 10
Thus, we have 10 groups of 3 objects each.
We are now asked to arrange each of these 10 groups in as
many orders as possible. We know that the number of permuta-
tions of three objects taken together is 3!. We may arrange each
of the 10 groups in 3! or 6 ways. The total number of possible
permutations of sC3 then is
sC3 • 3! = 10·6
which can be written as
sC3 • 3! =
SP3
The corresponding general form is
Knowing that
C -
n!
n
r
- r!(n - r)!
then
C

n!

n
r' r. = '( _ ),' r.
r. n
r.
n!
= (n - r)!
But
therefore,
p
=
n!
n
r
(n - r)!
This formula is read: The number ofpermutations of n objects
taken r at a time is equal to n factorial divided by n minus r
factorial.
8-15

EXAMPLE: How many permutation of six objects taken two
at a time can be made?
SOLUTION: The number of permutations of six objects taken
two at a time is written
6!
6P2 = (6 - 2)!
6J
= 4!
6·5·4J
4!
= 6·5
= 30
EXAMPLE: In how many ways can eight people be arranged
in a row?
SOL UTION: All eight people must be in the row; therefore,
we want the number of permutations of eight people taken eight
at a time, which is
8!
sPs = (8 - 8)!
8!
=01
(remember that OJ was defined as equal to 1)
then
8!
8'7·6'5·4'3·2·1
O! =
1
= 40,320
Problems dealing with combinations and permutations often
require the use of both formulas to solve one problem.
EXAMPLE: Eight first class and six second class petty officers
are on the board of the 56 club. In how many ways can the
members elect, from the board, a president, a vice-president, a
secretary, and a treasurer if the president and secretary must be
first class petty officers and the vice-president and treasurer must
be second class petty officers?
8-16

SOL UTION: Since two of the eight first class petty officers
are to fill two different offices, we write
8!
sP2 = (8 - 2)!
8!
= 6!
= 8·7
= 56
Then, two of the six second class petty officers are to fill two dif-
ferent offices; thus, we write
6!
6P2 = (6 - 2)!
6!
= 4!
= 6'5
= 30
The principle of choice holds in this case; therefore, the members
have
ways to select the required office holders.
EXAMPLE: For the preceding example, suppose we are asked
the following: In how many ways can the members elect the
office holders from the board if two of the office holders must
be first class petty officers and two of the office holders must be
second class petty officers?
SOLUTION: We have already determined how many ways
eight things may be taken two at a time, how many ways six things
may be taken two at a time, and how many ways they may be
taken together; that is,
and
then
8-17

Our problem now is to find how many ways the members can com-
bine the four offices two at a time. Therefore, we write
4!
4CZ = 2!(4 - 2)!
4!
= 2!2!
4· 3·2'1
=
2·2
=6
Then, in answer to the problem, we write
In other words, if the members have 4CZ ways of combining the
four offices and then for everyone of these ways, the members
have sPz . 6PZ ways of arranging the office holders, then they have
ways of electing the petty officers.
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
Find the answers to the following:
4. In how many ways can six people be seated in a row?
5. Seven boys and nine girls are in a club. In how many ways
can they elect four different officers designated by A, B,
C, and D if
a. A and B must be boys and C and D must be girls?
b. two of the officers must be boys and two of the officers
must be girls?
8-18

1. 120

4. 720
5. a. 3,024
b. 18,144
If we were asked how many different arrangements of the let-
ters in the word STOP can be made, we would write
4!
4P4 = (4 - 4)!
4!
= o!
= 24
We would be correct since all letters are different. If some of the
letters were the same, we would reason as given in the following
problem.
EXAMPLE: How many different arrangements of the letters
in the word ROOM can be made?
SOLUTION: We have two letters alike. If we list the possible
arrangements, using subscripts to make a distinction between the
O's, we have
R010zM
OIOzMR
OIMOzR
MOtOzR
R020 tM
0201MR
02MOtR

RMOzOt

02R01M
MR020 1
8-19

but we cannot distinguish between the O's; R0 10 2Mand R020 lM
would be the same arrangement without the subscript. Only half
as many arrangements are possible without the use of subscripts
(a total of 12 arrangements). This leads to the statement: The
number ofarrangements ofn items, where there are k groups of
like items of size rl,r2, ... rk, respectively, is given by
n!
In the previous example n was equal to 4 and two letters were alike;
therefore, we would write
4!
4·3·2·1
2!
2·1
= 12
EXAMPLE: How many arrangements can be made using the
letters in the word ADAPTATION?
SOLUTION: We use
n!
where
n = 10
and
rl = 2 (two T's)
and
r2 = 3 (three A's)
Then
n!

Although the previous discussions have been associated with
formulas, problems dealing with combinations and permutations
may be analyzed and solved in a more meaningful way without
complete reliance upon the formulas.
EXAMPLE: How many four-digit numbers can be formed
from the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
a. without repetition?
b. with repetition?
SOLUTION: The (a) part of the question is a straight-
forward permutation problem, and we reason that we want
8-21

the number of permutations of six items taken four at a time.
Therefore,
6·5·4·3'2·1
=
2·1
= 360
The (b) part of the question would become quite complicated if
we tried to use the formulas; therefore, we reason as follows:
We desire a four-digit number and find we have six choices
for the first position; that is, we may use any of the digits 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, or 7 in the first position:
(6)( )( )( )
Since we are allowed repetition of numbers, then we have
six
choices
for
the
second
position.
In
other
words,
any of the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 can be used in the second
position:
(6)(6)( )( )
Continuing this reasoning, we also have six choices each for the
third and fourth positions:
(6)(6)(6)(6)
Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers formed from
the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with repetition is
6·6·6· 6 = 1,296
EXAMPLE: Suppose, in the previous example, we were to
find how many three-digit odd numbers could be formed from
the given digits without repetition.
SOLUTION: We would be required to start in the units col-
umn because an odd number is determined by the units column
digit. Therefore, we have only three choices for the units posi-
tion; that is, either 3, 5, or 7:
(3)( )( )
8-22

For the ten's position, we have only five choices, since we are not
allowed repetition of numbers:
(3)(5)( )
Using the same reasoning of no repetition, we have only four
choices for the hundred's position:
(3)(5)(4)
Therefore, we can form
3'5'4 = 60
three-digit odd numbers from the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 without
repetition.
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
Solve the following problems:
1. Using the digits 4, 5, 6, and 7, how many two-digit numbers
can be formed
a. without repetition?
b. with repetition?
2. Using the digits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, how many five-digit
numbers can be formed
a. without repetition?
b. with repetition?
3. Using the digits of problem 2, how many four-digit odd
numbers can be formed without repetition?

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
1. Definitions:
A combination is defined as a possible selection of a certain
number of objects taken from a group without regard to order.
A permutation is defined as a possible selection of a certain
number of objects taken from a group with regard to order.
The product of the integers n through 1 is defined as n fac-
torial, and the symbol n! is used to denote this.
2. Factorial: Theorem. If nand r are positive integers, with n
greater than r, then
n! = (n)(n -
1) ... (r + 2)(r + l)r!
3. Combination formula:
c

n!
n
r
r!(n - r)!
for the number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time.
4. Principle of Cboice: If a selection can be made in nl ways; and
after this selection is made, a second selection can be made
in n2 ways; and after this selection is made, a third selection
can be made in n3 ways; and so forth for r selections, then the
sequence
of
r
selections

be
made
together
in

the following:
1. Apply the basic concepts of probability.
2. Solve for probabilities of success and failure.
3. Interpret numerical and mathematical expectation.
4. Apply
the
concept
of
compound
probabilities
to
independent, dependent, and mutually exclusive events.
5. Apply the concept of empirical events.
INTRODUCTION
The history of probability theory dates back to the 17th cen-
tury and at that time was related to games of chance. In the 18th
century the probability theory was known to have applications
beyond the scope of games of chance. Some of the applications
in which probability theory is applied are situations with outcomes
such as life or death and boy or girl. Statistics and probability
are currently applied to insurance, annuities, biology, and social
investigations.
The treatment of probability in this chapter is limited to sim-
ple applications. These applications will be, to a large extent, based
on games of chance, which lend themselves to an understanding
of basic ideas of probability.
BASIC CONCEPTS
If a coin were tossed, the chance it would land heads up is
just as likely as the chance it would land tails up; that is, the coin
9-1

has no more reason to land heads up than it has to land tails up.
Every toss of the coin is called a trial.
We define probability as the ratio of the different number of
ways a trial can succeed (or fail) to the total number of ways in
which it may result. We will let p represent the probability of
success and q represent the probability offailure.
One commonly misunderstood concept of probability is the
effect prior trials have on a single trial. That is, after a coin has
been tossed many times and every trial resulted in the coin falling
heads up, will the next toss of the coin result in tails up? The
answer is "not necessarily" and will be explained later in this
chapter.
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS
If a trial must result in any of n equally likely ways, and if
s is the number ofsuccessful ways and f is the number offailing
ways, the probability of success is
s
p = s+f
where
s+f=n
EXAMPLE: What is the probability that a coin will land heads
up?
SOL UTION: There is only one way the coin can land heads
up; therefore, s equals 1. There is also only one way the coin can
land
other
than
heads
up;
therefore, f
equals
1.
Since
s = 1
and
f=1
then the probability of success is
s
P=s+f
1
=I+T
1
=:2
This, then, is the ratio of successful ways in which the trial can
succeed to the total number of ways the trial can result.
EXAMPLE: What is the probability that a die (singular of
dice) will land with a 3 showing on the upper face?
9-2

SOLUTION: A die has a total of 6 sides. Therefore the die
can land with a 3 face up 1 favorable way and 5 unfavorable ways.
Since
s = 1
and
/=5
then
s
p = s+/
1
=1+5
EXAMPLE: What is the probability of drawing a black mar-
ble from a box of marbles if all 6 of the marbles in the box are
white?
SOLUTION: There are no favorable ways of success and there
are 6 total ways. Therefore,
s=O
and
/=6
so that
o
P=0+6
=0
EXAMPLE: What is the probability of drawing a black
marble from a box of 6 black marbles?
9-3

SOLUTION: There are 6 successful ways and no unsuccessful
ways of drawing the marble. Therefore,
s=6
and
/=0
so that
6
P=6+0
= 1
The previous two examples are the extremes of probabilities
and intuitively demonstrate that the probability of an event ranges
from 0 to 1 inclusively.
EXAMPLE: A box contains 6 hard lead pencils and 12 soft
lead pencils. What is the probability of drawing a soft lead pencil
from the box?
SOLUTION: We are given
s = 12
and
/=6
therefore,
12
P = 12 + 6

PROBABILITY OF FAILURE
As before, if a trial results in any of n equally likely ways,
and s is the number of successful ways and f is the number of
failures, the probability offailure is
q _
f
-s+1
or
n-s
=
n
where
s+l=n
or
n-s=f
A trial must result in either success or failure. If success is cer-
tain then p equals 1 and q equals O. If success is impossible then
p equals 0 and q equals 1. Combining both events, for either case,
makes the probability of success plus the probability of failure
equal to 1. If
s
p = s +f
and
then
s
f
P+q=s+l+s+f
= 1
If, in any event
p+q=l
then
q=l-p

In the case of tossing a coin, the probability of success
is
s
p = s+f

= 1+1
and the probability of failure is
q=l-p

EXAMPLE: What is the probability of not drawing a black
marble from a box containing 6 white, 3 red, and 2 black
marbles?
SOL UTION: The probability of drawing a black marble from
the box is

= 11
Since the probability of drawing a marble is 1, then the
probability of not drawing a black marble is

EXPECTATION
Expectation is the average of the values you would get in
conducting an experiment or trial exactly the same way many
9-8

times. In this discussion of expectation, we will consider two types.
One is a numerical expectation and the other is a mathematical
expectation.
Numerical Expectation
If you tossed a coin 50 times, you would expect the coin to
fall heads (on the average) about 25 times. Your assumption is
explained by the following definition of numerical expectation:
If the probability of success in one trial is p, and k is the total
number of trials, then kp is the expected number ofsuccesses in
the k trials.
In the above example of tossing the coin 50 times, the pro-
bability of heads (successes) is
En =kp
where
En = expected number
k = number of tosses
p = probability of heads (successes)
Substituting values in the equation, we find that
= 25
EXAMPLE: A die is rolled by a player. What is the expecta-
tion of rolling a 6 in 30 trials?
SOLUTION: The probability of rolling a 6 in 1 trial is
1
P=6
and the number of rolls is
k = 30
therefore,
En = kp
=5
9-9

In words, the player would expect (on the average) to roll a
6 five times in 30 rolls.
Mathematical Expectation
We will define mathematical expectation as follows: If, in the
event of a successful result, amount a, is to be received and the
probability of success of that event is p,
then ap is the
mathematical expectation.
If you were to buy 1 of 500 raffle tickets for a video recorder
worth $325.00, what would be your mathematical expectation?
In this case, the product of the amount you stand to win and
the probability of winning is
Em =ap
where
a = amount you stand to win
p = probability of success
and
Em = expected amount
Then, by substitution
Em = ap
= $325.00(5l>o)
= $0.65
Thus, you would not want to pay more than 65 cents for the ticket,
unless, of course the raffle were for a worthy cause.
EXAMPLE: To entice the public to invest in their develop-
ment, Sunshine Condominiums has offered a prize of $2,000 to
1 randomly selected family out of the first 1,000 families that par-
ticipate in the condominium's tour.
1. What would be each family's mathematical expectation?
2. Would it be worthwhile for the Jones family to spend
$3.00 in gasoline to drive to Sunshine Condominiums to
take the tour?
9-10

SOLUTION:
1. Em = ap = $2,000(1,600) = $2.00
2. No;
since
$3.00 is
$1.00 over their expectation of
$2.00, it would not be worthwhile for the Jones family
to take the tour.
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
1. A
box
contains
7
slips
of
paper,
each
numbered
differently. A girl makes a total of 50 draws, returning the
drawn slip after each draw.
a. What is the probability of drawing a selected numbered
slip in 1 drawing?
b. How many times would the girl expect to draw the single
selected numbered slip in the 50 draws?
2. In a winner-take-all tournament among four professional
tennis players, the prize money is $500,000. Joe Conners,
one of the tennis players, figures his probability of
winning is 0.20.
a. What is his mathematical expectation?
b. Would he be better off if he made a secret agreement
with the other tennis players to divide the prize money
evenly regardless of who wins?
ANSWERS:
1.
1
a. 7
1
b. 7"7
2.
a. $100,000
b. Yes; he would be better off, since he would make
$125,000, which is greater than his expectation of
$100,000.
9-11

COMPOUND PROBABILITIES
The probabilities to this point have been single events. In the
discussion on compound probabilities, events that may affect
others will be covered. The word may is used because indepen-
dent events are included with dependent events and mutually ex-
clusive events.
INDEPENDENT EVENTS
Two or more events are independent if the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of one of the events has no affect on the probability
of occurrence of any of the others.
When two coins are tossed at the same time or one after the
other, whether one falls heads or tails has no affect on the way
the second coin falls. Suppose we call the coins A and B. The coins
may fall in the following four ways:
1. A and B may fall heads.
2. A and B may fall tails.
3. A may fall heads and B may fall tails.
4. A may fall tails and B may fall heads.
The probability of anyone way for the coins to fall is calculated
as follows:
s = 1
and
n=4
therefore,
This probability may be determined by considering the product
of the separate probabilities; that is,
the probability that A will fall heads is!
the probability that B will fall heads is !
and the probability that both will fall heads is
9-12

In other words, when two events are independent, the pro-
bability that one and then the other will occur is the product of
their separate probabilities.
EXAMPLE: A box contains 3 red marbles and 7 green
marbles. If a marble is drawn, then replaced, and another mar-
ble is drawn, what is the probability that both marbles are red?
SOLUTION: Two solutions are offered. First, by the princi-
ple of choice, 2 marbles can be selected in 10· 10 ways. The red
marble may be selected on the first draw in three ways and on
the second draw in three ways; and by the principle of choice,
a red marble may be drawn on both trials in 3 . 3 ways. Then the
required probability is
9
p = 100
The second solution, using the product of independent events,
follows: The probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw
is
130'
and
the
probability of drawing
a
red marble on
the second draw is to' Therefore, the probability of drawing a red
marble on both draws is the product of the separate ptobabilities
or
PRACTICE PROBLEMS:
1. If a die is tossed twice, what is the probability of rolling
a 2 followed by a 3?
2. A box contains 2 white, 3 red, and 4 blue marbles. If after
each selection the marble is replaced, what is the probability
of drawing, in order
a. a white then a blue marble?
b. a blue then a red marble?
c. a white, a red, then a blue marble?

DEPENDENT EVENTS
In some cases one event is dependent on another; that is, two
IJr more events are said to be dependent if the occurrence or nonoc-
currence of one of the events affects the probabilities of occur-
rence of any of the others.
Consider that two or more events are dependent. If PI is the
probability of a first event; P2 the probability that after the first
happens, the second will occur; P3 the probability that after the
first and second have happened, the third will occur; etc., then
the probability that all events will happen in the given order is
the product PI . P2 . P3 ....
EXAMPLE: A box contains 3 white marbles and 4 black
marbles. What is the probability of drawing 2 black marbles and
1 white marble in succession without replacement?
SOLUTION: On the first draw the probability of drawing a
black marble is
On the second draw the probability of drawing a black marble is
9-14

On the third draw the probability of drawing a white marble
is
Therefore, the probability of drawing 2 black marbles and 1 white
marble is
P =PI' P2' P3
EXAMPLE: Slips numbered 1 through 9 are placed in a box.
If 2 slips are drawn, without replacement, what is the probability
that
1. both are odd?
2. both are even?
SOLUTION:
1. The probability that the first is odd is
and the probability that the second is odd is
Therefore, the probability that both are odd is
P = PI' P2

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS
Two or more events are called mutually exclusive if the
occurrence of anyone of them precludes the occurrence of any
of the others. The probability of occurrence of two or more
mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of the
individual events.
Sometimes when one event has occurred, the probability of
another event is excluded (referring to the same given occasion
or trial).
9-17

For example, throwing a die once can yield a 5 or 6, but not
both, in the same toss. The probability that either a 5 or 6 occurs
is the sum of their individual probabilities.
P = PI + P2
EXAMPLE: From a bag containing 5 white balls, 2 black
balls, and 11 red balls, 1 ball is drawn. What is the probability
that it is either black or red?
SOL UTION: The draw can be made in 18 ways. The choices
are 2 black balls and 11 red balls, which are favorable, or a total
of 13 favorable choices. Then, the probability of success is
13
P = 18
Since drawing a red ball excludes the drawing of a black ball,
and vice versa, the two events are mutually exclusive; so the
probability of drawing a black ball is
2
PI = 18
and the probability of drawing a red ball is
Therefore, the probability of success is
P = PI + P2

EMPIRICAL PROBABILITIES
Among the most important applications of probability are
those situations where we cannot list all possible outcomes. To
this point, we have considered problems in which the probabilities
could
be
obtained
from
situations
of
equally
likely
re-
sults.

Because some problems are so com-
plicated for analysis, we can only estimate
probabilities from experience and obser-
vation. This is empirical probability.
In modern industry probability now
plays an important role in many activities.
Quality
control
and
reliability of a
manufactured article have become ex-
tremely important considerations in which
probability is used.
Experience has shown that empirical
probabilities, if carefully determined on
the basis of adequate statistical samples,
can be applied to large groups with the
result that probability and relative fre-
quency are approximately equal. By ade-
quate samples we mean a large enough
sample so that accidental runs of "luck,"
both good and bad, cancel each other.
With enough trials, predicted results and
actual results agree quite closely. On the
other hand, applying a probability ratio
to a single individual event is virtually
meaningless.
We define relative frequency of success as follows: After N
trials ofan event have been made, ofwhich S trials are successes,
the relative frequency of success is
For example, table 9-1 shows a small number of weather
forecasts from April 1st to April 10th. The actual weather on the
dates is also given.
Observe that the forecasts on April 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10
were correct. We have observed 10 outcomes. The event of a cor-
rect forecast has occurred 7 times. Based on this information we
might say that the probability for future forecasts being true is
7/10. This number is the best estimate we can make from the given
information. In this case, since we have observed such a small
number of outcomes, we would be incorrect to say that the
estimate of P is dependable. A great many more cases should be
used if we expect to make a good estimate of the probability that
a weather forecast will be accurate. A great many factors affect
the accuracy of a weather forecast. This example merely indicates
something about how successful a particular weather office has
been in making weather forecasts.
9-21

Another example may be drawn from
industry.
Many
thousands of articles of a certain type are manufactured. The com-
pany selects 100 of these articles at random and subjects them to
very careful tests. In these tests 98 of the articles are found to meet
all measurement requirements and perform satisfactorily. This sug-
gests that 98/100 is a measure of the reliability of the article.
One might expect that about 98% of all of the articles
manufactured by this process will be satisfactory. The probability
(measure of chance) that one of these articles will be satisfactory
might be said to be 0.98.
This second example of empirical probability is different from
the first example in one very important respect. In the first example
we
could list
all of the possibilities,
and
in
the second
example we could not do so. The selection of a sample and its
size is a problem of statistics.
Considered from another point of view, statistical probability
can be regarded as relative frequency.
EXAMPLE: In a dart game, a player hit the bull's eye 3 times
out of 25 trials. What is the statistical probability that he will hit
the bull's eye on the next throw?
SOLUTION:
N= 25
and
S=3
hence
EXAMPLE:

the
probability that a person 20 years old will live to be 50
years old?
SOLUTION: Of 95,148 persons at age 20, 81,090 sur-
vived to age 50. Hence
P _ 81,090
- 95,148
= 0.852 (rounded)

pected to land with a 5 or 6 showing in 20 trials?

SOLUTION: The probability of a 5 or 6 showing is
The relative frequency is approximately equal to the probability
P==p
Therefore, since
where
N= 20
S=?
then rearranging and substituting, we find that
S=NP
= 20 (~)
= 6.67 (rounded)
This says that the expected number of times a die would land
with a 5 or 6 showing in 20 trials is 6.67; that is, on the average
a die will land with a 5 or 6 showing 6.67 times per 20 trials.

SUMMARY
The following are the major topics covered in this chapter:
1. Probability: Probability is the ratio of the different number
of ways a trial can succeed (or fail) to the total number of ways
in which it may result.
2. Probabilities of success and failure: If a trial must result in
any of n equally likely ways, and if s is the number of suc-
cessful ways andfis the number of failing ways, the probability
of success is
s
p = s+f
and the probability of failure is
r
n - s
q=~orq=--
s+f
n
where s +f = n or n - s = f
3. Expectation: Expectation is the average of the values you would
get in conducting an experiment or trial exactly the same way
many times.
4. Numerical expectation: If the probability of success in one trial
is p, and k is the total number of trials, then kp is the expected
number of successes in the k trials or
En = kp
5. Mathematical expectation: If, in the event of a successful result,
amount a is to be received, and p is the probability of success
of that event, then ap is the mathematical expectation or
Em =ap
6. Independent events: Two or more events are independent if
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one of the events has no
effect on the probability of occurrence of any of the others.
7. Dependent events: Two or more events are dependent if the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of one of the events affects the
probabilities of occurrence of any of the others.
9-25

8. Mutually exclusive events: Two or more events are called
mutually exclusive if the occurrence of anyone of them
precludes the occurrence of any of the others.
9. Empirical probability: Empirical probability is an estimated
probability from experience and observation.
10. Relative frequency of success: After Ntrials of an event have
been made, of which S trials are successes, the relative fre-
quency of success is

A thorough understanding of functions and functional notation is necessary at
this point.
In mathematics a variable, y, is said to be a function of
another variable,
x.
It is not enough to say that a change in x causes a
corresponding change in
~ because this is not always truei
for example, when y
equals a constant.
To allow for certain exceptions,
we have adopted the following
definition:
If for each value of variable x there is only one corresponding value
y,
then y is said to be a function of x.
Consider the equation y = 3.
This is a
straight line parallel to the X axis and intersecting the Y axis at 3.
No matter
what value is assigned to x, there is a corresponding value for Yi
in this example
3.
Functional notation is used as a brief and convenient way of symbolizing
that variable y is a function of variable x and is written y = fix)
where y is the
dependent variable and x is the independent variable.
This is read,
"y equals
f
of x."
This means y is some function of Xi
that is,
y has a value for each value
of x.
This symbolism does not mean that some quantity f is to be mUltiplied by
some quantity x.
It also does not indicate what the function of x is.
It could be
1 -
x 2 ,
3 sin x,
x lo9lOx, or any function involving x as the independent variable.
If more than one function of x must be

f is used,
such as:

When using functional notation,
we should remember that throughout a single
problem or discussion,
a given functional symbol such as fix)
will always represent
the same function,
and a symbol such as f(a)
means that the function fix)
is to be
evaluated at x = a.
Stated in symbols,
f(a)
represents the value of fix)
at x = a.
As an example,
find f(2)
when
y = fix) = x 2 -
x + 2
To find f(2),
we merely sUbstitute a
2 every place an x occurs in f(x).
f(2) = 22 -
2 + 2 = 4
Likewise,
fix)
may be evaluated for any constant value assigned to x and symbolized
in functional notation by placing in parenthesis the value x will have for that
particular problem.
In the above example find f(-2),
f(3),
and f(a).
Hence,
f(-2) = (-2) 2 -

Since a point

the graph of

be discontinuous.
The graph of the

This point is represented by a small
circle drawn on the curve at x equals 2.
Even though the curve does not exist at
x equals
2, no gap would be left that
could be physically seen.
The small
circle would actually contain an
infinite number of points and is
therefore only symbolic of the dis-
continuity.
Other forms of discontinuity can
be graphically shown.
The function,
y = tan x, is continuous in the
at these limits.
This curve continues
to repeat itself at
IT radian intervals
and is discontinuous at "/2 + nn,
where
n is any integer.
Generally speaking,
a function is

that is, if it can be

Remember,
the limit of an incre-

This does not,
however,
apply to
the ratio of two infinitesimals.
As
pointed out in your text,
the ratio may

Here is an additional example
using the four-step delta method given
in your text.
The derivative of
y = 2x 2 -
x + 8 is found as follows:
If x were to increase by an increment
~x, the corresponding increase in y
would be 6y.
This is illustrated in the
next equation where y + 6Y replaces the
y and x + 6X replaces all x's in the
original equation.
y + 6Y = 2(x + 6X)2

through the use of rules and
formulas.
The coordinates on the curve where a
maximum or a minimum occurs can be found
by substituting the determined values
of x back into the original equation of
the curve to find corresponding values
of y.
Thus when x = -1/5,

The work,
W,
done in moving an
•
object from coordinate a to
coordinate b is given by
W =J: F(x)
dx
where F(x)
is the variable force applied
to the object.
This expression for work has
application to the force required in
stretching a spring.
The force,
F(x),
required to stretch an elastic spring
is directly proportional to the extension
of the spring
(Hooke's Law)
or
F(x) = kx

Find the work done in stretching
a 21-inch spring to 24 inches if
a force of 12 lbs is necessary
to stretch the spring from its
natural length of 21 inches to
21 1/2 inches.
where k is the constant of proportionality.
EXAMPLE:
If the natural length of
a spring is 18 inches and a force of 20
pounds will stretch the spring to 21
inches,
find the amount of work done in
stretching the spring from a length of
20 inches to a length of 24 inches.
SOLUTION:
Since it is given that
a force of 20 pounds will stretch the
spring
3 inches
(21 inches -
18 inches)
or 1/4 foot,
then solving F(x)
= kx for
k gives
20 pounds
= k(1/4 foot)
or
k = 80 pounds per foot
and
F(x)
=
80x
The work done in stretching the spring
from 20 inches
(20
-
18 = 2-inch
extension or 1/6-foot extension)
to
24 inches
(24
-
18 = 6-inch extension

You may also use the expression

W =1: F(x)
dx in determining the
work done in pumping water out of the
top of a tank.
For a vertical
cylindrical tank with radius r feet and
height h feet,
the weight of the water
remaining in the tank is equal to
F(x) = knr 2 (h -
x)
where h
-
x is the height of the water
remaining in the tank and k = 62.5
(since water weighs about 62.5 pounds
per cubic foot).
Therefore,
the work
required to pump all of the water out
