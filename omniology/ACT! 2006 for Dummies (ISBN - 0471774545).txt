About the Author
Karen S. Fredricks began her life rather non-technically growing up in Kenya.
She attended high school in Beirut, Lebanon, where she developed her sense
of humor while dodging bombs. After traveling all over the world, Karen
ended up at the University of Florida and has been an ardent Gator fan ever
since. In addition to undergraduate studies in English and accounting, Karen
has a Master’s degree in psycholinguistics. Beginning her career teaching
high school English and theatre, Karen switched to working with the PC
during its inception in the early ‘80s and has worked as a full-time computer
consultant and trainer ever since.
Karen is an ACT! Certified Consultant, an ACT! Premier Trainer, a Microsoft
Office User Specialist, and a QuickBooks Pro Certified Advisor. She is the
author of both the ACT! 6 For Dummies and ACT! 2005 For Dummies books,
many copywrited training manuals, and the editor of ACT! Extra, a monthly
newsletter. She is a frequent guest on the several syndicated radio talk shows
and has frequent public speaking engagements. A true ACT! FanACTic, she
founded the ACT! Users Group of South Florida and served as the official host
for the ACT! 6 Launch Tour in Florida.
Karen resides in Boca Raton, Florida. Her company, Tech Benders, provides
computer consulting, support, and training services. In her spare time, Karen
loves to spend time with family and friends, play tennis, practice Yoga, and
write schlocky poetry.

Dedication
To my Mother, Frances Conn, in recognition of her ninetieth birthday. You’ve
always been there for me when I’ve needed you. You’re a smart, independent
lady who has been able to conquer just about anything — including driving a
stickshift in an RHD car. I love you!
Author’s Acknowledgments
I like to start each day reflecting on the many things for which I am thankful.
Here are a few of the people who have made my life a truly wonderful one.
The people at Wiley Publishing are fantastic to work with and have made
writing this book a pleasure! My acquisitions editor, Terri Varveris, has
become my friend as well as my editor. Thanks, Terri, and congratulations on
the new baby! My project editor, Blair Pottenger, was a true delight to work
with; thanks, Blair — and best wishes on your upcoming marriage! Teresa
Artman, my copy editor, had the unenviable task of making me look good;
Teresa, your edits were always right on!
I started my company, Tech Benders, just a few years ago and have come to
think of it as my third child. All the members of the ACT! Users Group are the
greatest; they remind me what using ACT! is all about. Thanks also to my
many wonderful clients who have become my friends along the way and have
helped to make my baby so successful! There have been many changes
within the ACT! organization during the course of the last year. This year saw
the departure of Ted Cooper after many years with ACT!. Fortunately, Melissa
Lorch, Paul Selby, and Beth Kohler are but a few of the great people who con-
tinue to make ACT! better and better, year after year. Joe Bergera and Larry
Ritter have recently joined the organization — their ideas and leadership will
ensure that ACT! continues to thrive. Richard McMakin — thanks for all your
help; like me, you never give up until you find the answer! Rich Carey — we
make an awesome team!
If you’ve ever worked with an ACT! Certified Consultant, I know you’ve found
them to be incredibly knowledgeable, conscientious, and professional. My
thanks go out to the entire ACT! CC Community for their willingness to share
anything and everything ACT!. Special thanks go out to some of the top 
gurus — and my good friends — Susan Clark, Stan Smith, John Kaufman,
Elaine Wirth, and Gay Chambers. Roy Laudenslager worked as an ACT!
Support Specialist for over 12 years before taking the plunge to come work
with me. He also let me coerce him into being the technical editor for this

book. He approached that job with the same thoroughness and cheerfulness
that he dedicates to any task. His incredible knowledge and experience make
him a joy to work with. Thanks, Royel!
As George Carlin once said, “Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull
you down.” I’m lucky to be able to say that I’ve got a lot of cheerful friends!
The names you see throughout this book are not fictional; they are the names
of all the special people in my life. Greetings go out to my Wednesday,
Saturday, and Sunday tennis games (Kalle, Nancy, Susan, Sue, Joanne, Jo, and
Linda) and to the whole gang at the Swim and Racquet Center of Boca Raton.
You guys rock!
Words can’t describe how special my daughters are to me. They have
brought such joy to my life and are a constant source of pride and support.
All my love goes out to the two most special people in my life: Andrea and
Alyssa Fredricks. You come from a family of strong women and will see your
hard work and efforts come to fruition. May you both continue to aim for the
stars! And finally to Gary Kahn, my wonderful friend, who came to me with
questions and ended up by supplying me with answers. All I can say is
“Thank you” — and pass the licorice, Teriyaki Boy!

Introduction
A
CT! is the best-selling contact manager that’s used by more than 
4 million professionals and 11,000 corporations worldwide. For many of
these users, ACT! represents their first foray into the area of contact relation-
ship management (CRM). Contact management software is a little more com-
plex to understand than other types of software. With a word processor, each
document that you create is totally separate; if you make a mistake, you need
only to delete your current document and start fresh. Contact management,
however, builds its way into a final product; if you don’t give a bit of thought
as to what goal you wish to achieve, you could end up with a muddled mess.
I am a fanACTic, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I use ACT! at work. I use
ACT! on the road. I use ACT! at home. I’ve even inspired my friends to use
ACT!. I’m excited about the product and know that by the time you learn to
unleash the power of ACT!, you’ll be excited, too.
So what am I so excited about? I’ve seen firsthand how ACT! can save you
time and help make you more efficient in the bargain. To me, accomplishing
more in less time is an exciting thought — it allows more time for the fun
things in life. Best of all, ACT! is a program that’s very easy to get up and run-
ning in a very short time. You’ll be amazed not only at how quickly you can
set up a database but also at how easily you can put that database to work.
Maybe by the time you finish this book, you, too, will become a fanACTic!
About This Book
ACT! 2006 For Dummies is a reference book. As such, each chapter can be
read independently and in the order you want. Each chapter focuses on a
specific topic, so you can dive right in, heading straight for the chapter that
interests you most. Having said that, however, I must say that I’ve tried to put
the chapters into a logical sequence so that those of you who are new to ACT!
can just follow the bouncing ball from chapter to chapter. More experienced
users can use the Table of Contents and the index to simply navigate from
topic to topic as needed.

Essentially, this book is a nuts-and-bolts how-to guide for accomplishing vari-
ous tasks. In addition, drawing on many of my own experiences as a full-time
ACT! consultant and trainer, I include specific situations that should give you
a feeling for the full power of ACT!.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like in most Windows-based software programs, you often have several dif-
ferent ways to accomplish a task in ACT!.
For the most part, I show you ways to perform a function by using the ACT!
menus. When an instruction reads Choose File➪Open, you must access the
File menu (located at the top of the ACT! screen) by clicking it with the left
mouse button and then choosing the Open option from the subsequent menu
that appears. In most cases, you can access these commands from anywhere
within ACT! although I generally advise new ACT! users to always start a task
from the Contact Detail view, which is the first window you see when ACT!
opens. If you must be in a particular area to complete a task otherwise, I tell
you where.
I also present you with keyboard shortcuts here and there. Generally, ACT!
shortcuts are triggered by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl key and another
key on the keyboard. For instance, the shortcut for recording a history is
Ctrl+H.
When you need to access one of ACT!’s hidden menus, click an appropriate
area of the screen with the right mouse button and then choose from the con-
textual menu that appears. In these instances, I simply say right-click when
you need to right-click.
What You Should Read
Of course, I hope that you’re going to sit down and read this entire book from
cover to cover. But then again, this book isn’t The Great American Novel.
And, come to think of it, the whole reason why you bought this book in the
first place is because you want to get your ACT! together (no groans, please!)
as quickly as possible because you’re probably finding yourself with too
much to do and too little time in which to do it.
2
ACT! 2006 For Dummies 

For the time being, I’m going to let you get away with reading just the parts
that interest you most. I’ll let you read the last chapter first and the first
chapter last if you like because this book is designed to allow you to read
each chapter independently. However, when you find yourself floating in a
swimming pool, soaking up the sun, and wondering what to do with all your
spare time, you might want to go back and read some of those chapters you
skipped. You just might discover something!
What You Don’t Have to Read
This book is intended for both new and existing ACT! users. Most of the
instructions apply to both groups of readers. Once in a while, I include some
information that might be of special interest to more advanced readers.
Newbies, feel free to skip these sections! Also, any information tagged with a
Technical Stuff icon is there for the truly technically inclined. Everyone else
can just skip this info.
Foolish Assumptions
One of my least favorite words in the English language is the word assume,
but I’ve got to admit that I’ve made a few foolish — albeit necessary —
assumptions when writing this book. First of all, I assume that you own a
Windows-based computer and that ACT! is installed on it. Secondly, I assume
that you have a basic knowledge of how to use your computer, keyboard, and
mouse, and that ACT! isn’t the very first application that you’re trying to
master.
I also assume that you have a genuine desire to organize your life and/or
business and have determined that ACT! is the way to go.
Finally (and I feel quite comfortable with this assumption), I assume that
you’ll grow to love ACT! as much as I do.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this book into six parts. Each part contains several chapters cov-
ering related topics. The following is a brief description of each part, with
chapter references directing you where to go for particular information:
3
Introduction

Part I: The Opening ACT!
In Part I, you get an introduction to the concept of a database and why ACT!
has become such a popular choice of database users (Chapter 1). In this part,
you read about what to expect the first time you fire up ACT! (Chapter 2) and
how to set the main preferences in ACT! (Chapter 3).
Part II: Putting the ACT! 
Database to Work
Part II focuses on putting your contacts into ACT! (Chapter 4) and, more
importantly, how to find them again (Chapters 6). I show you how to view all
the details about one contact, how to pull up a list of all your contacts, and
even how to create an easy list report.
After you master organizing your contact information, Part II helps you orga-
nize your day. ACT! makes it easy to take notes (Chapter 7) so that you start
relying on ACT! more and your memory less. You find out how to schedule
appointments, calls, and to-do’s — and other important events in your life.
And, you discover how to view those activities in the daily, weekly, and
monthly calendars (Chapter 8). Your life can become complicated, but have
no fear because ACT! does its best to help you navigate through the maze. The
History, Documents, and Secondary Contacts tabs allow you to accumulate
lots of information about each and every one of your contacts (Chapter 5).
Part III: Sharing Your Information 
with Others
Corporate America lives for reports, and ACT! is up to the challenge. Whether
you want to print labels or telephone directories on commercially printed
forms or prefer to utilize the ACT! built-in reports (Chapter 9), Part III shows
you how. I even tell you about building your own reports from scratch
(Chapter 10).
One of the best features of ACT! is the ability to communicate easily with the
outside world. Part III shows you how to work with templates to automate
routine documents as well as how to send out mass mail merges — whether
by snail mail, fax, or e-mail (Chapter 11). You also discover the advantages of
using ACT! for your e-mail client (Chapter 12).
4
ACT! 2006 For Dummies 

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing
We’re all different and often like to do things in our own unique way. ACT!
understands that concept, and Part IV helps you to customize ACT! to your
heart’s content. At first glance, ACT! might seem like just an over-the-counter
piece of software, but by adding fields (Chapter 13) and placing them on cus-
tomized layouts (Chapter 14), you can make it perform as well as an expen-
sive piece of proprietary software.
Every database needs an administrator. If you’re elected to the job, you need
to know how to perform administrative tasks, such as performing routine
maintenance, backing up your database, and checking for duplicate data entry
(Chapter 15). You’ll learn about ACT8diag, the higher-level maintenance tool,
and how to add multiple users to your database (Chapter 16). For those of you
using ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups, you can read about enhanced secu-
rity and automation of common maintenance tasks. If you have remote users
who need to access all or parts of your database, you need to know how to
synchronize your database (Chapter 17).
Part V: Commonly Overlooked 
ACT! Features
Part V focuses on four of the most frequently overlooked ACT! features:
 Microsoft integration: Synchronize your ACT! and Outlook address
books and calendars; attach a Web site in Internet Explorer directly to
an ACT! contact; and explore the various ways that you can use ACT!
and Excel together (Chapter 18).
 Sales opportunities: Track your prospective sales, prioritize them, and
analyze what you did right — or wrong — in making the sale (Chapter 19).
 Groups: Group your contacts to add a new dimension to your database
(Chapter 20).
 Companies: This is an exciting new feature of ACT! 2006. The Company
feature enables you to view and edit contacts that all “belong” to the
same company (Chapter 21).
In addition, I show you how to install and customize ACT! Premium for Web,
the online version of ACT! (Chapter 22).

Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
With apologies to David Letterman, Part VI gives you two of my favorite ACT!
lists. First, I discuss the top ten benefits of using the ACT! Premium for Web
product (Chapter 23). Finally, I give you ten of my favorite ways to help you
utilize ACT! to its fullest extent (Chapter 24). 
Icons Used in This Book
A Tip icon indicates a special timesaving tip or a related thought that might
help you use ACT! to its full advantage. Try it; you might like it!
A Warning icon alerts you to the danger of proceeding without caution. Do
not attempt to try doing anything that you are warned not to do!
Remember icons alert you to important pieces of information that you don’t
want to forget.
A Technical Stuff icon indicates tidbits of advanced knowledge that might be
of interest to IT specialists but might just bore the heck out of the average
reader. Skip these at will.
Where to Go from Here
For those of you who are ACT! old-timers, you might want to at least skim the
entire contents of this book before hunkering down to read the sections that
seem the most relevant to you. My experience is that the average ACT! user
probably uses only a portion of the program and might not even be aware of
some of the really cool features of ACT!. You might be surprised to discover
all that ACT! has to offer!
For the ACT! newbie, I recommend heading straight for Part I, where you can
acquaint yourself with ACT! before moving on to other parts of the book and
the ACT! program.

Part I
The Opening ACT!

In this part . . .
I
know that you’re excited about all the possibilities
that ACT! has to offer and want to dive into the pro-
gram as soon as possible. Here’s where you find an
overview of some of the cool features that you find in
ACT!. You also become familiar with the many faces of
ACT!; after all, you wouldn’t want to get lost along the
way. But first, you have to do a bit of homework and whip
ACT! into shape by fiddling with a few preference settings
to ensure that ACT! produces the type of results that
you’re looking for.

Chapter 1
An Overview of ACT!
In This Chapter
 What is ACT!?
 Who uses ACT!?
 Basic ACT! concepts
 A few basic ground rules
 The “Two ACT! Flavors”
S
o what is ACT!, anyway? I find that one of the hardest things that I have
to do with ACT! is to explain exactly what it is. I like to initially explain
ACT! by using very politically correct terminology. For example, ACT! 2006
 Is a contact management software package
 Provides users and organizations with powerful tools to manage their
business relationships
 Can be customized based on your company’s requirements
 Is the world’s leading contact management software
Feel free to use these points to impress your friends. You might want to men-
tion some of the wonderful features of ACT!, which I do in the first section of
this chapter. I also describe the typical ACT! user and give you a brief primer
on some pertinent ACT! terminology. I give you a few ground rules that I’ve
established over the years after watching new users wrestle with certain
aspects of using ACT!. Finally, I talk about the two versions of ACT! that are
available to you.
What Does ACT! Do?
Because I want you to enjoy the benefits of using ACT!, I’ve put together a
little shopping list of features so that you can see all that ACT! can do for you,
too. In parentheses after each item, I include a chapter reference where you
can find more information about a particular feature (if you’re so inclined).

ACT! is a multifaceted personal management tool that
 Stores complete contact information, including name, company, phone
numbers, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses. (Chapter 4)
 Comes with over 50 predefined fields for each contact that you add to
your database. If you want to add additional fields to meet your specific
needs, go right ahead. (Chapter 13)
 Records an unlimited number of dated notes for each of your contacts
so that you can easily keep track of important conversations and activi-
ties. This feature is particularly useful for those of us who (unlike our
friend, the elephant) do forget things on occasion. (Chapter 7)
 Keeps more than a boring old calendar. Your scheduled activities are
cross-referenced with the appropriate contact so that you have a full
record of all interactions that you’ve had — or will have — with that
contact. In addition, you can set an alarm to remind you of the impor-
tant stuff as well as roll over less-important things until the next day.
(Chapter 8)
 Prints out anything from simple phone lists or address books to detailed
reports on activities, notes, leads, and sales opportunities. You can print
reports of your reports if you feel so inclined. (Chapters 9 and 10)
 Creates mailing labels and envelopes. Or, if you prefer, perform broad-
cast faxes and e-mails with ACT!. (Chapters 11 and 12)
 Manages your sales pipeline with built-in forecasting tools. You can
easily print a few sales reports or create a graph showing your open,
won, or lost sales. (Chapter 19)
 Synchronizes data with remote users. If you have other ACT! users in
remote locations, you can send database changes to them and vice
versa. (Chapter 17)
 Lets you design and activate a series of activities to automate your
tasks, thus assuring that none of your contacts “fall through the cracks.”
(Chapter 8)
The Typical ACT! User
So just who is the typical ACT! user? Well, with more than 4 million registered
ACT! users and 11,000 businesses currently using ACT!, you’re safe to assume
that nearly every industry is represented among its user base. Although ACT!
started primarily as a tool for salespeople wanting to follow up on their
prospects and customers, ACT! has evolved into a tool used by any individual
or business trying to organize the chaos of daily life.
10
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

I think it’s only fair to warn you about one of the possible side effects that
you might develop if you use ACT!. If you’re anything like me, you’ll become
addicted to ACT! and eventually use it to manage all facets of your busy exis-
tence. You might just become a fanACTic. (Quite simply, a fanACTic is an ACT!
user who has become addicted to using ACT!.)
So just who is using ACT!? Everyone.
 A CEO uses ACT! because he wants to know what his salespeople are
doing and how his customers are being treated.
 An administrative assistant uses ACT! it to automate routine tasks and to
keep a schedule of various tasks and activities.
 A salesperson uses ACT! to make sure that she’s following up on all her
prospects.
 A disorganized person uses ACT! to help him become more organized.
 A smart person uses ACT! because she knows that she’ll have more time
to play by working more efficiently.
 A lazy person uses ACT! because he knows it’s more fun to play than to
work.
So what kinds of businesses use ACT!? All kinds.
 Large businesses that want to improve communication among employees
 Small businesses that have to rely on a small staff to complete a multi-
tude of tasks
 Businesses of all sizes looking for software that can automate their busi-
nesses and make them more productive in less time
 Businesses looking to grow by marketing to their prospects
 Businesses looking to retain their current customers by providing an
excellent level of customer service and developing lasting relationships
So who’s not using ACT!? Okay, I just said that simply everyone is using ACT!,
but a few stubborn folks remain out there who aren’t looking to organize their
lives, such as
 Workaholics who live to spend every waking moment at work
 Hermits who don’t need to schedule any appointments or remember to
make follow-up phone calls
 Individuals with photographic memories who retain all information and
never need to take a note
 Companies that require no paperwork
 Businesses that do no marketing or that have no interest in expanding
their customer base
11
Chapter 1: An Overview of ACT!

A Few Concepts to Get You Started
Nobody likes technical jargon, but in the course of showing you how to use
ACT!, I might end up lapsing into Geek Speak and use a handful of somewhat
technical terms; I just can’t avoid it. Becoming familiar with them now is less
painful in the long run.
First things first. ACT! is a database program. A database is a collection of
information organized in such a way that the user of the database can quickly
find desired pieces of information. Think of a database as an electronic filing
system. Although most ACT! users create a database of contacts, some users
develop ACT! databases to collect information about things other than con-
tacts. For example, you might create an ACT! database to catalog all the CDs
and DVDs in your collection.
Traditional databases are organized by fields, records, and files:
 Field: A field is a single piece of information. In databases, fields are the
smallest units of information. A tax form, for example, contains a number
of fields: one for your name, one for your Social Security number, one for
your income, and so on. In ACT!, you start with 50 separate fields for
each individual contact. You find out how to add information into these
fields in Chapter 4. And, in Chapter 13, I show you how to change the
attributes of existing fields and how to add new ones to your database if
you’re the database administrator.
 Record: A record is one complete set of fields. In ACT!, all the informa-
tion that you collect that pertains to one individual contact is a contact
record.
 File: A file is the entire collection of data or information. Each database
that you create in ACT! is given a unique filename. You can create more
than one file or database in ACT! — head to Chapter 3 to find out how.
The Basic ACT! Ground Rules
Sometimes you just need to learn things the hard way. After all, experience is
the best teacher. Luckily for you, however, I’ve compiled a list of rules based
on a few mistakes that I see other ACT! users commit. You’re not going to find
these rules written down anywhere else, and they might not even make a
whole lot of sense to you at the moment. However, as you become more and
more familiar with ACT!, these rules will make all the sense in the world. You
might even want to refer to them from time to time.
12
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Karen’s Four Rules of Always:
 Always log in to ACT! as yourself.
 Always strive for standardization in your database by entering your data
in a consistent manner.
 Always input as much information into your database as possible.
 Always perform routine maintenance of your database at least once a
week and create a backup after any session that involved new data
input!
The Two ACT! Flavors
ACT! 2006 comes in two separate editions. Everything I cover in this book
applies to both versions of ACT!:
 ACT! 2006
 ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups
Every feature found in ACT! 2006 is also found in ACT! 2006 for Workgroups
as well. However, from time to time, I point out a feature that is found only in
the workgroup version. 
All users sharing the same database must be using the same edition of ACT!;
this means that one user can’t be in ACT! 2006 while another is in ACT! 2006
for Workgroups. It also means that users of an older version such as ACT! 6
can’t share a database with users of an ACT! 2006 database. 
You’ll want to be aware of the basic differences between the two versions, so
here they are:
ACT! 2006
ACT! 2006 is geared towards the individual or small business user with less
than ten users. Most small environments would typically not use the enter-
prise features found in ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups. ACT! 2006:
 Utilizes the Desktop Edition (MSDE) version of SQL
 Is designed for individuals and small workgroups
 Allows a maximum of ten active named users per database
 Has a size limitation of 2GB per database
13
Chapter 1: An Overview of ACT!

 Considers contacts as Public (viewable by all database users) or Private
(viewable only by the Record Manager who created the record)
 Has two methods of synchronizing remote data
 Can’t open a database created using ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups
ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups
It’s important to note that ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups contains all of
the features found in ACT! 2006. However, the Premium version also includes
several extra features that the corporate user just might find appealing.
 Includes Microsoft (MS) SQL Server Standard Edition but can also work
with MSDE if preferred
 Is designed for the corporate enterprise user
 Doesn’t place a limit on the number of database users
 Is more scalable, meaning that it’s unlikely you’ll outgrow your database
 Takes the issue of security one step further by adding a third level of
contact access — limited access.
Database managers and administrators can allow users or teams of
users to access these limited access contacts on a contact-by-contact
basis.
 Has three methods of synchronizing remote data
 Can open a database created using ACT! 2006 and can save a database to
ACT! 2006 format
 Includes Group Invitations and resource scheduling
 Provides advanced administrative functionality, including silent installa-
tions and automated maintenance procedures (Chapter 16).
 Provides advanced opportunity tracking
So what are you waiting for? Boot up your computer, grab the book, and get
going. After all, it’s time to ACT! (pun intended).

The Various Faces of ACT!
In This Chapter
 Starting the correct database
 Logging in correctly
 Knowing about the My Record
 Maneuvering in ACT!
 Getting help with ACT!
A
fter getting the hang of maneuvering in ACT!, you’ll find that it’s an
amazingly easy program to master. The key is to become familiar with
the lay of the land before you start building your contact database. By doing
so, you avoid playing hide-and-seek later. To that end, I show you how to log
into and open an ACT! database. Although initially getting around in ACT! is
pretty easy, you might become lost in the maze of views and tabs that ACT! is
divided into. I help you navigate through that maze by taking you on a tour of
ACT! so that you can become familiar with the various ACT! screens. Finally,
you discover the places that you can turn to if you need additional help.
Locating the Correct Database
When you open ACT!, by default, ACT! opens up the database that was last
open on your computer. Easy enough, huh? If, however, you stumble into the
incorrect database by mistake, you need to know how to find the correct one.
If you’re lucky enough to have inherited a database that someone else devel-
oped (someone who maybe even placed that database on your computer for
you), be sure to ask where that database is located — before that person
walks out of your life.

The default database location is the place on your computer that ACT! uses to
store any new databases that you create and look in to open any existing
database. If your database isn’t in the default location, you have to move
your database to the correct location, change the default location (as I dis-
cuss in Chapter 3), or browse to the location of your database.
The first screen that you see when opening an ACT! database each and every
time is the Contacts Detail window. If you click around and end up in any of
the other ACT! screens by accident, don’t panic. One of the nice things about
ACT! is that you can execute most commands from any ACT! screen (unless 
I tell you otherwise). And I promise that pretty soon, the various screens
become so familiar to you that you’ll be able to navigate through ACT! with
the best of them.
To open an existing database, make sure that ACT! is open and then follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open Database from the ACT! Contact Detail window.
The Open dialog box appears (see Figure 2-1).
2. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Look In box.
3. Double-click the folder that contains your database to expand.
4. Click the name of your database and then click Open.
If you prefer, double-click the name of the database that you want to
open.
Figure 2-1:
Opening 
an ACT!
database.
16
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

When you open an ACT! database, you actually use a shortcut; these short-
cuts all end with the .pad file extension. Every ACT! database actually stores
three different groups of data:
 Main database: The main database consists of all your contacts’ infor-
mation, activities, notes, histories, and so on. The database files are
stored on your local machine by default. You can move the database and
all associated files to another location or even over to a network drive if
you so desire.
 Database supplemental files: These files and folders are automatically
created when you create a new database and include layouts, templates,
e-mail messages, and any attachments associated with a contact record.
You cannot change the location of these files in the database; they are
automatically stored as part of your database.
 Personal supplemental files: These files, which are saved to your local
computer, include files such as word processing documents not associ-
ated with a contact, newly created layouts, and templates. E-mail mes-
sages and attachments associated with contacts are also saved as
personal supplemental files.
The ACT! Login Screen
If more than one person shares your ACT! database, ACT! presents you with a
login screen each time you attempt to open your database. If you are the only
person using a database, the login screen will not appear. Essentially, the
login screen (as shown in Figure 2-2) asks you for your user name and your
password. Your user name and password are not case sensitive (that is, you
can enter your name by typing either lowercase or UPPERCASE letters). You
also need to make sure that you enter your user name and password informa-
tion correctly. For example, if your user name includes your middle initial
with a period, you must type that middle initial — including the period — to
gain access to your database.
Figure 2-2:
Logging on
to ACT!.
17
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

Generally, the Administrator of your database determines your password.
The database Administrator is the person responsible for making major
changes to the database and for performing routine database maintenance
(Chapter 16). Although several users may all have access to an ACT! data-
base, ACT! doesn’t require that each user have a password. If the database
Administrator didn’t assign you a password, just leave the password area
blank.
If you are assigned a password, notice that asterisks appear while you type it
in. That’s normal. Just like when you type your ATM card PIN, your ACT! data-
base password is hidden while you type it to prevent any lurking spies who
might be watching from learning your password. You’re able to change your
own password; see Chapter 3 to find out how.
Figure 2-2 shows that ACT! gives you the option of saving your password (an
option automatically selected by default). Although this option helps you to
log on to your database a little faster in the future, think about making this
decision. First of all, what good is a password if it always magically appears
anytime that you attempt to access your database? Secondly, by having ACT!
remember your password, you may eventually forget it yourself!
The Importance of Being My Record
The first contact that you see when opening an ACT! database is your own —
that’s your My Record. My Record is nothing more than a contact record that
is associated with a user of the database. Your My Record stores all your own
information, which automatically appears in some of the preset templates
that come with ACT!. For example, a fax cover sheet includes your telephone
and fax numbers; a report has your name at the top; and a letter has your
name at the bottom.
If someone else’s information appears as the first contact record that you see
when you open your database, explore these three possibilities:
 Did you log in as yourself? If not, do so. Then, when you open ACT! 
again — logged in as yourself — your My Record appears.
 Did you inadvertently change your own contact information? If that’s the
case, change it back.
 If you’re 100 percent certain that you logged in as yourself and haven’t
changed your contact information, your database is likely corrupted. I’m
not trying to scare you, but I recommend that you turn to Chapter 15,
where I show you how to perform a little CPR on your database.
18
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Taking the time to enter all your own contact information is very important. If
you don’t, you might find that you’re missing key information when you start
to work with templates and reports. For example, if you never enter your own
fax number, your fax number doesn’t appear on the Fax Cover Sheet tem-
plate, which means you have to fill it in every time that you send a fax. Save
yourself the trouble and fill in your My Record right off the bat.
Your My Record also allows you to use a few other important ACT! features:
 Permission to perform various functions is based on the security level of
your My Record.
 Contacts, notes, histories, activities, and opportunities marked as
Private can be viewed only by the Record Manager who created them.
 Every time you enter a new contact, your name appears as the creator of
that contact.
 When you delete a contact, a history of that deletion appears in the
History area of your My Record.
 Every time that you add a note to a contact record, your name appears
as the Record Manager of that note.
 When you schedule an activity, your name automatically attaches to that
activity.
Finding Your Way around in ACT!
The purpose of this book is to serve as a reference for both new and existing
ACT! users. I certainly don’t want to lose anyone along the way. New ACT! users
might be somewhat intimidated when they encounter ACT! for the first time. Be
assured that this experience is akin to the first time you drive a new car at
night in the rain: momentary panic sets in. After you’ve driven the car for a
week or so, the location of the light and windshield wiper controls becomes
second nature. I guarantee you’ll have the same experience with ACT!.
Navigating through ACT! is fairly easy. However, to make the navigating even
easier, I highlight throughout this section a number of pitfalls that you want
to avoid.
19
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

The title bar
The title bar at the top of the screen provides you with two pieces of key
information:
 The software name
 The database name
Don’t overlook the importance of this wealth of information! If your title bar
reads FreeCell, you’ve stumbled into the wrong piece of software. If the
database name indicates ACT8demo, chances are pretty good that you’re in
the wrong database and may be adding hundreds of new contacts to the
wrong place. And if the user name is not yours, you may not be getting the
appropriate credit for all your hours of hard work. You can see the title bar,
along with other key areas of ACT!, in Figure 2-3.
The record counter
ACT! supplies you with a record counter in the top-left corner of the Contact
Detail window (refer to Figure 2-3). The first number indicates the number of
your record as it relates alphabetically to the other members of your current
lookup. A lookup refers to the contacts in your database that you’re currently
working with. (You can find out everything that you ever want to know about
Figure 2-3:
The opening
ACT!
screen.
20
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

a lookup in Chapter 6.) This number changes when you add or remove con-
tacts. The second number supplies you with the total number of contacts in
either your entire database or your current lookup.
To the left and right of the record counter is a set of left- and right-pointing
triangles. You can click these triangles to navigate through the contact
records. For instance, to go to the previous record, you simply click the left-
pointing triangle. Refer to Figure 2-3, which shows how to use these triangles.
I recommend getting into the habit of checking the total number of contacts
in your database each time you open ACT!. If the total number of contacts
changes radically from one day to the next, you just might be in the wrong
database. Worse yet, a dramatic change in the number of contacts may indi-
cate corruption in your database.
The layout
One of the biggest sources of confusion to the new ACT! user is the use of 
layouts. The layout refers to the order in which fields appear on the ACT!
screens as well as the colors, fonts, and graphics that you see. You can spec-
ify the colors, fonts, and graphics in the layout as well as the position and
order of fields. If the database Administrator created new fields for the data-
base, he then needed to add them to a layout. In Chapter 14, I explain how
you can create your own customized layouts.
 Modify the contact, company, and group layouts or create your own
layouts to suit your needs.
There’s no right or wrong layout — only the layout that you prefer. For
example, maybe the Sales Department needs to see one set of fields, but
the Customer Service Department needs to see an entirely different
group of fields — and want them to appear in a specific order.
 Remove fields that you don’t use or move fields to other tabs.
 Add fields to your layout
 Change the order of the tabs
 Add your own tabs to the bottom of a layout.
Renaming and reordering the tabs to your liking helps you organize your
fields. For example, you might want to keep all the personal information
about a customer on one tab and the products that he’s interested in on
another tab.
You can find the name of the layout by clicking the Layout button in the
lower-left corner of the ACT! screen, as shown in Figure 2-3. If you inadver-
tently switch layouts, you might not be able to see all the information in your
database, or you might see your information arranged in a different order. At
21
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

this point, panic often sets in. Don’t worry — your data is most probably
alive and well and viewable with the help of the correct layout. To switch lay-
outs, click the Layout button to access a list of all layouts; from that list,
choose a different layout.
Make sure you take the time to acquaint yourself with the name of the layout
that you’re using. You might find yourself the victim of one of those random,
drive-by clickings you’ve been hearing so much about and end up in the
“wrong” layout. If you know the name of your preferred layout, you can easily
find it.
The menu bar
Like most software programs, ACT! comes equipped with a menu bar that
appears at the top of every ACT! screen. These menus include all the options
available for the current view. You can customize all menus to fit your needs;
check out Chapter 3 for the details.
A quick way to familiarize yourself with ACT! is to click each and every one of
the menu items. You might see something that piques your interest. You
might click the Schedule menu and notice the Activity Series option.
Hopefully, curiosity overcomes you, and you have an overwhelming desire to
find more about that feature. Or you might notice the Sort choice listed in the
Edit menu and think hmmm, maybe I can sort my database in a different
order than alphabetically by company.
Many times, you’ll find that you can accomplish a task in a variety of ways. If
you’re a keyboard shortcut aficionado, you’ll find the most frequently used
shortcuts in the front cover of this book. Although I know you’ll have a copy
of this book next to you at all times, you can also glean these shortcuts from
the menus. In Figure 2-4, you can see that the shortcut appears to the right of
each menu item. In addition, notice that an icon appears to the left of some of
the menu items; this means that you’ll find that corresponding icon some-
where on the icon bar if you prefer to click rather using the menus or key-
board shortcuts.
Figure 2-4:
Getting the

of ACT!
menus.
22
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

The toolbar
ACT! also features a toolbar at the top of each window. The toolbar includes the
most commonly used tasks of the current view. Toolbars work much the same
way as the menu bars. You can customize each toolbar to include the tasks
that you use most frequently; see how in Chapter 3. And, like the menu bars,
toolbars vary depending on the view that you’re in. For example, the toolbars
that you see in the calendar views include a Show Filter/Hide Filter icon to
change the view settings on your calendar, and the toolbar that you see in the
Group Detail window include icons for creating groups and subgroups.
The Back and Forward bar
Lurking just below the toolbar is the Back and Forward bar, which provides
you with a road map of sorts by letting you know the exact area of ACT!
you’re working in. And, like your Internet browser, the Back and Forward bar
has handy-dandy left- and right-pointing arrows that allow you to return to
the previous window you were viewing.
The Contact Detail window
When you first open ACT!, you land in the Contact Detail window, which
allows you to see all the information about one specific contact. You can use
the Contact Detail window to enter, modify, and view information about your
contacts. Each contact record displays as a single page that is divided into a
top and bottom half:
 The top half of the screen contains generic fields such as name, business
address and phone that are probably used by just about all ACT! users
everywhere. Many of these fields are used extensively in the templates
(that is, reports, letters, fax cover sheets, and labels) that ACT! has
already set up for you.
 The tabs at the bottom provide additional fields for each of your con-
tacts. These are generally the fields that you don’t use as much, such as
home address and spouse’s name.
You can — and should — customize the bottom half of the screen to
better serve the needs of your business. You can click through the page
tabs in the middle of the screen to get an idea of some of the fields sug-
gested by ACT!. I show you how to add contact information into your
database in Chapter 4 and how to modify those tabs in Chapter 14.
23
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

The Divider bar
One of the fast food chains used to have a jingle about “having it your way” a
number of years back and you might want to hum a few bars of that tune
each time you open ACT!. A point in case is the Divider bar that separates the
top half of the Contact Detail window containing the fields from the bottom
half containing the tabs. Got a lot of fields in the top half of your screen? Grab
the Divider bar and drag it down. Want to have more room to view some of
the tabs along the bottom? Grab that bar and drag it up a bit.
The Navigation bar
ACT!’s Navigation — or Nav — bar is the column of icons located along the
left side of the program. The Nav bar allows you to move quickly between the
various areas in ACT!. For example, to view all the information about one par-
ticular contact, click the Contacts icon; to see a list of all your groups, click
the Groups icon.
The ACT! tabs
Because ACT! comes with approximately 50 predefined fields — and because
your database Administrator might add another 50 or so customized fields —
placing those fields where you can see them clearly is important. Plunking
100 fields on one half of your screen gives you a jumbled mess. I suppose that
you could lay out those fields by using a smaller font, but the result (although
neat) is impossible to read!
ACT! solves this dilemma in a rather unique fashion. The top half of the
Contact Detail window displays the most basic fields that are fairly typical to
all contacts. In this portion of the screen, the fields include places for the
name, address, and phone numbers as well as a few miscellaneous fields. The
bottom half of the ACT! screen displays additional information about your
contact that’s divided into categories, which you access by clicking tabs
located across the middle of the Contact Detail window.
The first seven tabs (refer to Figure 2-3) — Notes, History, Activities,
Opportunities, Groups/Companies, Secondary Contacts, and Documents —
are called system tabs. The system tabs are actually tables; they don’t hold
single fields with a single piece of information in each one. Rather, you can
add an unlimited number of like items to the same tab. For example, you can
add multiple notes about your contact using the Notes tab, or you might have
numerous sales opportunities that involve your current contact displayed on
the Opportunities tab.
24
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Because the system tabs contain tables rather than fields, you can’t cus-
tomize them in the same way as the other tabs. However, you can remove a
system tab or change their order. Chapter 14 shows you how to fix the order.
Depending on the layout you’re using, you probably see several additional
tabs after the system tabs. These tabs generally display less frequently used
information about your contact, such as these:
 The User Fields tab displays ten user fields; these fields are just waiting
for you to customize them.
 The Home Address tab reveals your contact’s home address, personal
e-mail address, and phone number as well as the spouse’s name.
You can find out how to customize the user fields in Chapter 13 and the lay-
outs in Chapter 14.
Do not proceed to add new information in the User Fields without first renam-
ing them. Many new ACT! users make this mistake and end up with an unruly
assortment of information in each of these fields. Worse yet, other users of
your database might misinterpret this information — or start entering in
their own data — further complicating the whole mess.
All the tabs are dependent on the layout that you’re currently using. If you
switch layouts, your tabs change as well. Some of the ACT! add-on products
add new tabs to your ACT! screen. For example, the ACT! QuickBooks link
draws information from QuickBooks and plops it into a brand new tab called
QuickBooks.
Getting Help When You Need It
In addition to the information that I provide in this book, ACT! 2006 comes
with a very good — and quite extensive — online Help system that supplies
step-by-step instructions for just about any ACT! feature that you might want
to explore.
You can access the ACT! online Help system in one of two ways when ACT! is
open:
 Press the F1 key on your keyboard.
 Choose Help from any ACT! menu bar.
When you access ACT!’s Help menu, you’re treated to several options. All
these Help options provide a wealth of information, and you shouldn’t be
afraid to use them.
25
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

 Help Topics: This option supplies you with lots of information based on
the window that’s open. Use this option when you find yourself scratch-
ing your head about something, and you’ll probably be rewarded with
just the answer you’re looking for.
 How to Use Help: This area of Help provides you with the most informa-
tion. In fact, you can find so much good information that this section is
further subdivided into three tabbed areas:
• Contents: Think of the Contents tab as the Table of Contents in a
book. The Contents tab presents you with the major topics cov-
ered in ACT!. Click the plus sign next to each topic to find a more
detailed listing of the subject.
• Index: As its name implies, the index is just like the index you find
at the back of a book. It provides you with an alphabetical listing of
every feature found in ACT!. You can either scroll through the list
of features or type in the first few letters of the feature that you’re
looking for.
• Search: The Search tab provides you with the most in-depth infor-
mation about the various ACT! features. This feature is particularly
helpful if you aren’t sure of the exact name of the feature that
you’re trying to find. For example, say you’re looking for instruc-
tions on how to force a field to display only capital letters. A
search of the Index tab doesn’t help you (the feature is actually
called Initial Capitalization), but you can find the information by
typing capital in the Search tab. Figure 2-5 gives you an idea of all
the help you can find in the Search window.
 Feature Tours: We all learn in our own way, and the Feature Tours are
designed for those of us who want someone to take us by the hand and
walk us through a few of the more complex ACT! features. When you
open one of the tours, you’re treated to ACT! screenshots walking you
through a process. All the relevant icons and buttons have been labeled
so that you get a real understanding of how the process works. The four
Feature Tours are
• Customizations: Includes instructions on how to add new fields,
drop-down lists, and layouts
• Groups and Companies: Instructs you on setting up groups and
companies; explains the differences between the two
• Opportunity Tracking: Demonstrates how to set up a new sales
opportunity and ways that you might want to track it later
• Handheld Link Installation: Shows you how to link your PDA to ACT!.
 Online Manuals: ACT! comes with two nifty PDF files. One is a Quick
Reference card that you can print to help you with the most common 
of ACT! features. The other is a rather large document that you can refer
to — or print — when you need extra help.
26
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

 Getting Started Wizard: In your zealous haste to start working with
ACT!, you might have chosen to ignore the wizard that pops up immedi-
ately after you first fire up ACT!. The Getting Started Wizard ensures that
your word processor and e-mail preferences are set correctly and helps
you to either convert an existing database or create a new one.
 ACT! Update: As much as you might want to think that the software you
purchase is perfect in every way, it’s not. Very often, users like you dis-
cover bugs, or little errors in the software. Sometimes, major changes
such as the release of a new operating system can cause your software
to exhibit some bad behavior. An update patch generally corrects these
problems. The ACT! update ensures that you have the latest and great-
est release of ACT!; best of all, there is no charge for this service!
 Service and Support: Ever wonder how to find help when you really
need it? Three great options here can provide a bit of extra handholding:
• Contact information: Includes a link to the various fee-based sup-
port options offered by Best Software.
• Knowledge Base: Includes articles written by ACT!’s tech support
about commonly asked questions and procedures.
Figure 2-5:
Using the
Search
window in
ACT!’s Help.
27
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

• ACT! Consulting: Most of you know a brother, buddy, or colleague
who “knows” ACT!. As the old saying goes, a little knowledge is a
dangerous thing. In reality, these well-intentioned folks probably
know ACT! as it pertains to their business — not yours. Unless
they earn a living by consulting in the ACT! program, they’re proba-
bly not your best source for accurate information.
Your best source of help for ACT! is an ACT! Certified Consultant.
These consultants (ACCs) earn their livelihood by working with
people like you. They are certified ACT! fanACTics who spend a
great portion of their day working with any and all things ACT!.
They can help you with anything from converting to ACT! from
another program and customizing your database to training your
employees. Most ACCs even make house calls. Clicking the ACT!
Consulting option takes you for a field trip out to an Internet site
that contains a listing of all the local ACT! consultants.

Getting Your ACT! Together
In This Chapter
 Creating a new database
 Changing the ACT! preferences
 Customizing your toolbars and menus
I
could easily have titled this chapter “Have It Your Way” because here’s
where I show you how to set up a new database. You discover some of the
preference settings that you can change in ACT!. If you’re sharing your data-
base across a network, you’ll read about the preferences that are specific to a
network. Finally, if you’re a real power-user, you’ll be excited to know how to
change your menus and toolbars.
Creating a New ACT! Database
If your initial meeting with ACT! entailed looking at the Act8Demo database
that comes with ACT!, you know that it’s a great demo database to use for
learning purposes before actually starting to work on your own database.
After playing with the demo for only a short time, you’re probably eager to
start working on your very own database. The easiest way to create your first
database is by using the Getting Started Wizard. In addition to setting you up
with a new database, the wizard helps you to set a few of the most basic pref-
erences needed for ACT! to work correctly.
The Getting Started Wizard opens up automatically when you first installed
ACT!. If you you’ve already gone through it the first time, feel free to skip this
section.
Follow these steps to set up your new ACT! database with the Getting Started
Wizard:

1. From any ACT! screen, choose Help➪Getting Started Wizard.
The first of the five Getting Started Wizard screens appears.
At this point, feel free to put your feet up on the desk, answer a few
questions, and let ACT! do the grunt work for you.
2. On the wizard’s introductory screen, click Next to get started.
Quick as a flash, the Getting Started Wizard - Word Processor screen
appears. Here’s where you get to choose your word processor. It’s an
either/or proposition; you have only two choices (see the next step).
3. Choose Microsoft Word (if Word is installed on your computer); other-
wise, choose the ACT! word processor. 
Chapter 11 explains how to create a mail merge. If you’re using Word,
you’ll want to use this as your preference because you are already famil-
iar with most of its features.
4. Click Next.
In the next screen, you get to tell ACT! which e-mail client you’re using.
(For information on determining which e-mail client you need to be
using, scurry over to Chapter 12.)
5. Select the e-mail program of your choice and then click Next.
If you prefer, you can even tell ACT! that you prefer to skip the e-mail
setup for now. You can read more about setting up your e-mail in
Chapter 12.
By now, I’m sure you realize running a wizard means clicking the Next
button a lot. Smart reader! However, the next step in the wizard gets a
wee bit more challenging because you have to decide to create a new
database, convert an existing database from a prior version of ACT! into
ACT! 2006 format, or just skip the database setup. I make the assumption
that you are setting up a brand-new ACT! database; that’s the direction
the steps take.
6. Select Set Up Database Now and then click Next.
In this step of the Getting Started Wizard, you get to make a couple of
decisions about the future of your database, as you can see in Figure 3-1.
• Database Name: You might want to give the database a really cool
moniker, such as the name of your company, so that you can easily
identify it later.
The name of your database cannot include spaces or punctuation
marks. However, you can use an underscore and capital letters. For
example, consider naming your database My_Company rather than
Mycompany.
30
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

• Location: By default, the database is saved to the default database
folder. Unless you change that preference, the default location is
C:\My Documents\ACT\ACT for Windows 8\Databases. You
can also indicate whether you want to share this database with
other people with whom you might be networked.
• User Name: The person setting up the database is also one of the
database Administrators. Keeping this in mind, indicate the name
of the database Administrator.
• Password: The good news is that as you type your password, each
character appears onscreen as an asterisk just in case someone is
lurking over your shoulder trying to nab your password. The bad
news is that because you can’t see what you’re typing, you might
just type something you didn’t intend to. ACT! demands that you
retype your password to ensure that you didn’t misspeak the first
time.
An ACT! database does not require a password. It’s better to leave
the password blank than to add one — and forget what it is!
7. Fill in the appropriate information and then click Next.
The final screen of the Getting Started Wizard appears, recapping all the
important decisions that you just made about your new database. If you
made a mistake or simply change your mind, now’s the time to click the
Back button and fix things!
8. Double-check your answers carefully, make the appropriate changes
(if any), and then click Finish.
When you’re ready to add contacts to the database, head to Chapter 4.
Figure 3-1:
Setting up a
new ACT!
database.
31
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

If you already set your preferences, you don’t need to use the wizard to
create a new, blank database or to create another database. Just do the fol-
lowing. (To see how to set preferences, see the upcoming section, “Giving
ACT! the Preferential Treatment.”)
1. Choose File➪New Database from any of the ACT! views.
The New Database dialog box appears. By coincidence, it is identical 
to the New Database screen of the Getting Started Wizard (refer to
Figure 3-1).
2. Fill in the database name, location, user name, and password
(optional), and then click OK.
Your currently opened database will close and the newly created data-
base will open.
Copying an Existing Database
Each time you create a new database by using either the Getting Started
Wizard or by choosing File➪New Database, you create a new, pristine data-
base based on ACT!’s original out-of-the-box fields. After you use ACT! for a
while, you might want to create a new database based on a database that you
or someone else has customized.
If you make an exact copy of your database, be careful how you use it. If you
merely want to place a database on another computer for reference, making
an exact copy by following these steps is fine. However, if your intention is to
create a database for a remote user for purposes of synchronization, read
Chapter 17 to find out how to create a database for a remote user. If you’re
creating a copy of a database for backup purposes, check out Chapter 15,
where I show you how to create an ACT! backup.
1. Choose File➪Save Copy As from any of the ACT! views.
The Save Copy As dialog box opens (see Figure 3-2), where you decide
what type of database you want to create.
2. Type a name for the copy of the database.
Do not make the mistake of assigning the same name to the new data-
base that you use for your existing database. Even though you save the
database copy to an entirely new location, there’s a good chance that
you could accidentally use the wrong database. By default, whenever
you open ACT!, it opens the last database that you used; ACT!’s title bar
tells you the name of the currently opened database but not its path. If
two databases have the same filename, you could end up working in the
incorrect database — without even realizing it.
32
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

3. Specify the location for the new database.
By default, the new database is saved to C:\My Documents\ACT\ACT
for Windows 8\Databases. You can also indicate whether you want
to share the database.
4. Specify the type of database you’re creating.
Although creating a copy of your existing database is easy, you must
understand the consequence of your decision at this point. Consider
your choices:
• Create a Copy of the Database: This option creates an exact replica
of your currently opened database. After you create a new ACT!
database and customize it by adding many new fields, you might
want to duplicate it for use by other offices or for other businesses
that you might own. The new database copies the field structure of
your existing database as well as all the actual contact records
within the database.
• Create an Empty Copy of the Database: This option creates a blank
database that contains all the customized fields that you created in
your existing database, but it does not contain any of the contact
records from your original database.
5. Click OK.
A dialog box appears asking you to insert the name of the primary user
of the database, as shown in Figure 3-3.
6. Fill in the user name and password for the primary user of the data-
base.
Figure 3-2:
Creating a
copy of a
database.
33
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

As you see in Figure 3-3, you’re also given an option to select a user
name from the current database, which is what you want to do if the pri-
mary user is already one of the contacts in the database that you’re
copying. You are now ready to start entering contact records into your
new database. Chapter 4 contains the details about adding contact
records to a database.
Working with Passwords
If you’re the only user using your ACT! database — or if your clients love you
and would chop their arms off at the wrist before turning to one of your com-
petitors — security might not be an important issue for you. When you start
ACT! it will not prompt you for a user name and password. But if you’re like
most people, you probably prefer not to share every tidbit of information 
in your database with anyone who wanders into your office. Whether you
want to prevent certain personnel from changing the basic field structure of
your database or adapt a look-but-don’t-touch attitude with the unfortunate
computer-challenged among your employees, ACT! has a variety of security
methods that can help you accomplish your security goals. You can choose
one of the following:
 Assign a specific security level to each user; I show you how to do that
in Chapter 16.
 Determine which contacts any one user can access; you can read about
ACT!’s Contact Access feature in Chapter 16.
 Password-protect your database; I discuss this option throughout the
rest of this section.
Unless a contact record is marked as private, ACT! 2006 has no way of allow-
ing someone access to only a portion of the contacts in a database. If you
want to limit the contacts a particular user sees, you have a couple of
Figure 3-3:
Selecting
the main
user of the
new ACT!
database.
34
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

options. You can upgrade to ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups, which
allows access to user records, based on your team preferences. You can also
supply the user with his own database and synchronize just those contacts
that he has access to from the main database as I show in Chapter 17.
Setting a password
Both the database Administrator and the individual database user can set a
password for the user. The theory for this is that the individual can pick a
password that has some meaning to him — and so, hopefully, he doesn’t
forget it. If a user does forget his password, however, the Administrator can
reset it; you can see how to do that in Chapter 16.
If you have access to a database and are afraid that some nasty person might
use your name to gain access illegally, I recommend assigning a password to
yourself, which is ridiculously easy. Here’s what you do:
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose File➪Set Password.
The Set Password dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-4.
2. Leave the Current Password text box empty.
3. Type your new password in the New Password text box. Then, for
added excitement, type it once more in the Confirm New Password
text box.
4. Click OK.
Changing a password
After you add a password to your database, or if multiple users access your
database, you are prompted to supply your user name and password each
time you try to open up your ACT! database.
Figure 3-4:
Set a user’s
password
here.
35
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

You might not know your password because you don’t have one, so before
tracking down your Administrator to change a password for you, try leaving
the password field blank. (I frequently get phone calls and e-mails from ACT!
users who have no idea what password is assigned to them. Guess what?
They often don’t have one!)
However, if you try every password that you can think of — and even try
using no password at all — and still can’t gain access to the database, you
might have to bribe the database Administrator into resetting your password.
I find that chocolate chip cookies work the best, but feel free to pick the bribe
of your choice. Then, make sure the Administrator follows these steps:
1. Choose File➪Set Password from any ACT! view.
If you’re going through this chapter section by section, you already
know that you can do this from within any of the ACT! screens. I don’t
mean to sound like a broken record here; I just want you to get used to
the idea.
2. Enter the current password in the Current Password text box.
3. Enter the new password in the New Password text box.
4. Enter the new password again in the Confirm New Password text box.
5. Click OK.
From time to time, you might want to change your password. Perhaps you
feel that a former employee compromised your security, or maybe you’ve
just been watching too many James Bond movies. Whatever the case, remem-
ber the new, improved password, or you might be forced to chase the data-
base Administrator around with another batch of cookies!
Giving ACT! the Preferential Treatment
After you install ACT! on your computer, becoming familiar with various pref-
erences is a good practice. If you’re the sole user of the database, these set-
tings likely save your sanity. If you share the database with other users, these
settings can probably save you all a lot of head scratching.
If you create your original database by using the Getting Started Wizard,
some of your preferences are already set. However, reviewing your work
never hurts! Your preference settings are the place to turn to if you’re the
kind of person who likes to have things your own way. You might routinely
store all your documents in a specific location and want ACT! to follow that
same example. Or you might have a fondness for fuchsia and orange and
want to have your ACT! screens coordinate with this color scheme.
36
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Here’s how to change several of the most basic preference settings. Feel free 
to flip through the various preference tabs to get an idea about additional 
preference settings that you might also want to tweak. You can find the ACT!
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-5, by choosing Tools➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box is arranged into six tabs, each of which I discuss
in the following sections.
General
As the name implies, you find an assortment of preferences on the General
tab. General preferences allow you to specify settings for your database, such
as how names and salutations display on your contact records, whether
checking for duplicate records is enabled or disabled, and where files associ-
ated with your database are stored. ACT! automatically stores your database
in the My Documents folder. Your database contains all your basic contact
information as well as supplemental files such as layouts, templates, and
saved e-mail messages. In addition, you might want to have your own set of
personal supplemental files; this area is where you can tell ACT! where you
prefer to have them saved.
A few of the preference settings might not be available to you if you’re not the
database Administrator; for example, you can’t change the history or dupli-
cate checking options that appear on the General tab of the ACT! preferences.

Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

Colors & Fonts
You can set the colors and fonts for almost any area of ACT! including all list
views, tabs, and calendars. However, there isn’t a global color setting; you
must set the colors and fonts for each item separately in the Colors & Fonts
tab, as shown in Figure 3-6. To set colors and fonts, follow these steps:
1. On the Colors & Fonts tab, select an item to customize from the
Customize list.
In the Customize list, you find a list of all the lists, calendars, and system
tabs. You’ll also notice in Figure 3-6 several items in the list with the
words Detail Composition; these indicate areas in ACT! in which you can
write in extra details when necessary. For example, Chapter 8 talks
about scheduling activities; when you schedule the activity you can
optionally add extra details or notes about the activity. You can even
customize the look of those if you’d like.
2. Click the Font button.
The Font dialog box appears.
3. Select the font, style, and size of the font.
4. Click OK.
Figure 3-6:
Set color
and font
preferences
here.

Part I: The Opening ACT! 

5. In the Appearance section, select the text and background color for an
item you select from the Customize list.
6. To change the appearance of another item, select the item from the
Customize list and repeat Steps 2–5.
7. Click OK to save your color and font preferences.
You might want to make sure that the colors you pick for the text and back-
ground colors result in a legible combination. For example, choosing black
text with a black background would not be a great idea, nor would the combi-
nation of a yellow font on a white background.
Calendar & Scheduling
The Calendar & Scheduling tab is nothing more than a gateway to the heart of
the matter: changing the calendar and scheduling preferences.
When you click the Calendar Preferences button, you can set
 The days of the week you want to appear on your work week calendar
 The minute intervals for your daily and work week calendars
 Various calendar options, such as whether or not you want to see pop-
ups when you hold your mouse cursor over a scheduled activity
 How you want to banner all-day events so that a border appears on the
corresponding day on your monthly calendar
When you click the Scheduling Preferences button, you can get the Activity
Type Settings dialog box. From here, you select the activity type for which
you want to set options. You can set options for each activity type, but you
must set the options one activity type at a time. The options you can include
for each activity type are
 The priority level you want to display automatically when the activity
type is scheduled. For example, you might want phone calls to be
marked with a medium priority but meetings automatically set to a high
priority.
 How long before the activity you want the Ring Alarm to sound for the
activity type
 The default duration for the activity type
 The fields for which you want to display drop-down lists for the activity
type
39
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

E-mail
Exactly as advertised, the E-mail preference tab is the area where you tell
ACT! exactly how you want to handle your e-mail. The preferences you might
want to set include
 The e-mail system you want to use with ACT!: Microsoft Outlook,
Outlook Express, Lotus Notes, or Internet Mail
 Composing options, including signatures, dealing with forwarded and
replied messages, and even how you want the recipient’s name to
appear when composing a new e-mail message
 How often you want ACT! to notify you about newly received messages
 How you want to handle attachments that you receive
Communication
The Communication tab lets you choose your word processor and fax prefer-
ences including
 The word processing and fax software you want to use with ACT!
 How you want ACT! to check your spelling in e-mail messages and
word processing documents
 The Dialer options if you want ACT! to automatically dial an outgoing
number and record the length of the phone call
Although the Dialer feature can be a great timesaver, you must have the
appropriate hardware installed in order to use it. Quite simply, dialing
requires that your computer can access a dial tone. This can be accom-
plished in one of two ways:
• Your computer has a dialup modem into which you can plug a phone
line.
• Your telephone system is equipped with Telephone Application
Programming Interface (TAPI) hardware and the appropriate tele-
phone driver software is installed on your computer.
 The Quick Print header and footer options when printing any of the
ACT! lists, including Company, Group, Opportunity, Contact, Notes,
History, Activity, and Secondary Contacts
40
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Startup
The Startup options dictate both the default settings for each new contact
added to your database and how ACT! starts up every time you run the 
program.
 The Record Creation setting lets you set the default to Public or Private
for each new contact, group, and opportunity you add to the database
as well as whether you want to automatically link each new contact to
his company record and record a history of the event.
 Startup Database lets you specify the database you want ACT! to open
automatically as well as how often you want ACT! to check for new soft-
ware updates.
 The Automatic Updates option informs you any time a new update patch
is available for ACT!.
Customizing the Navigation Bar
One of the things you might find the most endearing about ACT! is your abil-
ity to mold the program how it feels the most comfortable to you. You might
decide that for whatever reason, you don’t like the look of the Navigation
(Nav) bar (those big icons that run down the left side of ACT! as seen in
Figure 2-3). No problem — all you have to do to “have it your way” is follow
the next few steps:
1. Right-click the Navigation bar.
Note the menu that appears is divided into three sections. You actually
get to choose one option from both the top and middle sections.
2. Chose one of the options from the top section of the menu:
• Large: That’s the size of the Nav bar icons when you first 
install ACT!.
• Small: If you’re working on a small monitor — or just want to have
a little more viewing room — you might want the Nav bar icons to
be small so the rest of your screen can be larger.
3. Chose an option for the middle section of the Nav bar menu:
• Standard: The Nav bar shows you eight of the most common views
that will help you navigate to areas in ACT! such as the Task List
and calendar.
• Expanded: For those of you who live for detail, the Nav bar shows
you 14 icons; you might want to set the size to small so that you
don’t have to scroll down to see all those options.
41
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

• Classic: For those of you loyal ACT! fanACTics who want things,
well, like you’re used to seeing them in versions 6 and earlier,
here’s your chance to have the Nav bar look “just like it used to.”
• Customize: If you’re still not happy with the look and feel of the 
Nav bar, feel free to choose the Customize option. A little window
opens magically that allows you to drag additional icons to the 
Nav bar — or get rid of the ones you don’t want.
The calendar icon is an example of a Navigation bar icon that you
might want to replace. By default, clicking it brings you to the daily
calendar. That’s fine if that’s the calendar you’re most comfortable
using. However, many of you might prefer to use the weekly — or
work week — calendar instead. If that’s the case, customize the
Nav bar by dragging away the calendar icon and replacing it with
the calendar item of your choice.
Modifying the Icon Bar
Customizing the various ACT! menus and toolbars to include functions that
you use on a regular basis is a great way to improve your efficiency. Changing
your toolbar literally allows you to perform various functions at the click of a
button.
Adding items to the toolbar
One thing you might find a little unique in ACT! is the variety of toolbars that
you encounter along the way. You see one toolbar while working in the
Contact Detail window but a different toolbar when you foray into the Group
Detail window. That said, realize that an icon you add to one of your toolbars
doesn’t appear on another. That’s okay because adding icons to any one of
the ACT! toolbars is easy.
I encourage you to do a little homework before tackling the toolbar. Don’t
worry, the assignment is fairly simple; you need to decide in advance which
icon you want to add as well as which menu it’s located on. Although this
step isn’t critical, it saves you from floundering around later. After doing your
homework, follow these steps to add an icon to any toolbar:
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose Tools➪Customize➪Menus and
Toolbars.
For the right-clickers in the audience, you can also give the toolbar a
click with the right button of your mouse and choose Customize.
42
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

2. Click the Commands tab in the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog
box (see Figure 3-7).
3. Select the name of the menu that contains the command that you want
to add to your toolbar.
If you did your homework, pat yourself on the back. If you didn’t, have
fun flipping through all the choices in the Categories list and scrolling
through all the corresponding commands until you stumble upon the
item that you want to add to the toolbar. I hate to be an “I told you so,”
but. . . .
4. Drag the desired command to the toolbar.
As you drag the command to the toolbar, a black line materializes that
indicates exactly where the icon is going to appear.
5. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
Tweaking the toolbar icons
I’m almost embarrassed to tell you how easily you can further customize the
icons on your toolbars. But, because you’re such a good person, I am going
to tell you. You might store this information away for future reference and use
it to impress your friends some time in the near future.
Figure 3-7:
Customize

here.
43
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

1. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
By the way, Customize is not only the choice you want to choose — it’s
your only choice!
2. Drag any icon you want to another spot on the toolbar.
Now’s your chance.
3. Right-click the icon that you want to modify.
Because you’re such a nice person, you are treated to the menu shown
in Figure 3-8.
4. Chose the modification items of your choice.
• Reset All: Resets all your toolbar and menu customization to the
original value
• Delete: Deletes the currently selected icon
• Name: Allows you to rename the icon’s ToolTip
• Default Style: Shows just an icon on the toolbar without including
any text
• Text Only: Shows only a text command on the toolbar without the
icon
• Image and Text: Shows both an icon and text command on the 
toolbar
5. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
Monkeying with the Menus
After you master the icon bar, customizing the menus will seem like a piece of
cake. Most of the techniques that I mention here will sound eerily familiar
because you modify your menus in pretty much the same way as you do your
icon bar.
Figure 3-8:
Options for
customizing
the icon bar.
44
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Ordering additional menu items
For your first feat, add some new goodies to your menus.
1. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
If you feel a slight sense of déjà vu, it’s because you’re treading on very
familiar territory.
2. Click the Commands tab of the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
3. Select the name of the menu that contains the command that you want
to add to your toolbar menu.
4. Drag the desired command up to the menu that you want to modify.
This is where you do things slightly differently than you did with the
icon bar (see the preceding section). As you drag the command to the
menus, they pop open. Resist the temptation to let go of your mouse
button! If you linger your mouse on any of the sub-menu items, they pop
open for you as well. When you arrive at your scheduled destination, a
black line materializes that indicates exactly where the item is going to
appear.
5. Let go of your mouse button.
I’ll bet you thought I was never going to say that! If your finger feels
numb, that’s okay — the reward of having your new items appear on
your menus is certainly worth any pain you might have encountered.
6. Drag any menu item you want to another menu.
You’ll probably find that ACT!’s menus seem pretty logical, but as they
say — different strokes for different folks. If you decide that Preferences
should be located on the Edit menu or that the Backup command should
really be listed on the Tools menu, go for it. Hover your mouse over the
menu with the target item; when the menu pops open, drag it to the cor-
rect spot on the new menu.
7. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
Adding a separator
Glance at Figure 3-8 to notice a horizontal line separating some of the menu
items; this is a separator. You can add separators to menus in order to group
similar or related commands.
45
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

1. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
After the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog box is open, the 
menus and toolbars are alive and well and just waiting for you to 
add a separator.
2. Right-click the area on a menu where you would like to add a 
separator.
You’ll want to click on the menu item just below where you’d like to add
the separator. The separator will be added above the selected menu
item.
3. Click Begin Group.
Lo and behold, the separator is added right where you aimed.
4. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
Adding a custom command
Normally I shudder when someone asks me whether they can perform a task
“with the click of a button.” As you can see throughout this book, most
processes take a couple of clicks. However, you can create custom com-
mands to make ACT! run one of your favorite software programs or some of
your customized reports and templates. Want to open Excel from ACT! with
the click of a button? Add it to one of your ACT! menus or toolbars. Have you
created some templates that you use repeatedly? You might want to think
about adding those goodies to the Write menu.
1. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
2. Click the Custom Commands tab (as shown in Figure 3-9) from the
Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog box.
3. Click the New button.
4. Type a name for the command in the Command Name field.
The name you choose is simply used to identify your custom command.
You don’t need to wrack your brain here. If you decide to add Excel to a
menu, you might want to name the command Excel.
5. Enter a short description of the command in the Tooltip Text field if
you want a pop-up description to be associated with a new icon.
6. Click Browse to navigate to either the location of the application’s exe-
cutable file or to one of ACT!’s customized documents.
7. Click OK to close the navigation dialog box and then click the Add
Command button.
46
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

After you create a custom command, your next task is to get it to magically
appear on one of your ACT! menus. I know, by now, you’re getting tired of
reading all about menu bar customizations. You don’t want to follow an entire
new set of commands. I don’t blame you. But guess what? If you’ve read
through this chapter, you know how to add those new custom command
items to your menus. Hop back to the section “Ordering additional menu
items” to find that those directions are just about all you need to make it
happen.
Refer to Figure 3-7 to see that one of the categories listed is Custom
Commands. What a coincidence. You can find all your newly created custom
commands just sitting there, waiting to be dragged to the appropriate menu.
Time to go put your feet up and rest a bit — you’ve worked very hard!

Part II
Putting the ACT!
Database to Work

In this part . . .
O
kay, after you whip ACT! into shape (see the preced-
ing part of this book), it’s time to get your life in order.
ACT! is a contact manager, which (as the name implies)
makes it a great place to manage your contacts. First, you
add new contacts into your database, and then you need to
know how to find them again. After you locate your con-
tacts, you can schedule an activity with any one of them,
set a reminder, and maybe add some notes for good mea-
sure. (Sure beats the heck out of a yellow sticky note!)

Chapter 4
Making Contact(s)
In This Chapter
 Adding new contacts
 Duplicating contacts
 Deleting contacts
 Updating contact information
A
database is only as good as the contacts that it contains. In ACT!,
adding, duplicating, deleting, and editing the contacts in your database
is easy to do. In this chapter, I show you how to do all four of these tasks to
maintain an organized, working database. Adding new contacts is only half
the fun; being able to find them is why you have the database in the first
place. Inputting contacts in a consistent manner ensures that all your con-
tacts are easy to find. And after you add a contact, you can easily duplicate it
if you have other contacts that share the same address and phone numbers.
If you need to change that contact’s information or delete the contact, stay
tuned. I demonstrate how to change contact information and even how to
“unchange” changes that you might make by mistake!
Adding New Contacts
On the very simplest level, the main purpose of ACT! is to serve as a place to
store all your contacts. You can add and edit your contacts from the Contact
Detail window because it contains all the information that pertains to one
particular record and allows you to see all your contact fields.
Every time that you add a new contact, ACT! automatically fills information in
three fields: Record Creator, Record Manager, and Create Date. If you click the
Contact Info tab of your layout, you’ll notice these three fields. When you add
a new contact, ACT! inserts your user name into the Record Creator and
Record Manager fields and the current date into the Create Date field. This
tab enables you to search for all the new contacts that you created within a
given date range. The Record Creator and Create Date fields serve as a per-
manent record, and you cannot change them. Managers and administrators
can override the contents of the Record Manager field if they so desire.

You probably have lots of contacts that you’re dying to enter into your data-
base, so what are you waiting for? Jump right in and follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already in the Contact Detail window, go there by click-
ing the Contacts icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
Don’t know about the Nav bar? Check out Chapter 2, where you find out
all you need to know about the Nav bar and then some.
2. In the Contact Detail window, choose from one of three ways to add a
new contact to your database:
• Choose Contact➪New Contact.
• Click the New Contact icon on the toolbar.
• Press Insert (on the keyboard).
Initiating any of the preceding commands results in a blank contact
record. You’re now ready to enter the new contact’s information.
3. Begin entering information by clicking in the Company field and
typing the contact’s company name.
ACT! doesn’t distinguish between actual contacts and blank contacts.
Failure to enter information or repeatedly pressing Insert results in
numerous blank contact records, which are of no use and serve only to
clog the database. So, although you are free to leave any of the ACT!
fields blank, you do have to enter something — at the very least, I rec-
ommend the key pieces of information such as the contact’s name, com-
pany name, and phone number — so you might as well begin with the
company’s name.
You can always go back to a record and delete, add, or change any infor-
mation in any field. See the later sections, “Deleting Contact Records”
and “The Contacts, They Are A’Changin’.”
4. Click in the next field where you want to enter information and start
typing.
You can also use the Tab key to advance to the next field. In your initial
excitement to start entering all your existing contacts, if you inadver-
tently press Tab once too often, you might find that you advanced one
too many fields and ended up in the wrong field. Don’t fret: Press and
hold down the Shift key and then press Tab to move your cursor in the
reverse direction. If you prefer, you can also get back to any field simply
by clicking in it with your mouse.
5. Continue filling in fields.
As I mention in Chapter 2, ACT! comes with approximately 50 prepro-
grammed fields that reflect the needs of most users. Many of the fields
are fairly self-explanatory (and reflect the type of information that you
probably expect to find in any address book): contact name, company
52
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

name, phone, city, state, and ZIP code. These are conveniently located in
the top half of the Contact Detail window; see Figure 4-1. A few of the
fields are a little less obvious:
• Address: If you assume that the three fields ACT! provides for the
address is meant to store three alternative addresses, you’re
wrong! The second and third address fields are meant for really
long addresses. These fields are good places to include a suite
number or building name if it is an integral part of the address.
• ID/Status: The ID/Status field is essentially the category field, and
it files each of your contacts into categories. By using the ID/Status
field, you don’t have to manually set up a variety of databases: one
for your friends, one for your clients, one for your vendors, and so
on. The ID/Status field comes preset with a few dozen of the most
commonly used categories in its drop-down list, including employ-
ees, customers, vendors, and competitors, which makes searching
for each of these categories a snap.
• Salutation: This field refers to the name that comes after the word
Dear in a letter, which is used in your letter templates. By default,
ACT! (being the friendly type) uses the first name. Feel free to
change the salutation to a more formal one. Read more about
changing this in the following section.
If you prefer using the more formal salutation as the default set-
ting, choose Tools➪Preferences and click the Salutation
Preferences button conveniently located on the General tab.
Figure 4-1:
The Contact
Detail
window.
53
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

• Referred By: This field is one of the most commonly overlooked
ones in the database. Information entered into this field is used in
the Source of Referrals report; failure to enter Referred By informa-
tion renders the report useless. So what’s the big deal? Suppose
you’re paying for advertising in two newspapers — wouldn’t know-
ing which one attracted the most prospects be nice? If you’re
attending trade shows or putting a lot of time and effort into your
Web site, wouldn’t you like to know whether your efforts result in
any new business? And, if an existing customer sends you lots of
new leads, wouldn’t remembering him with a nice gift at holiday
time be nice? Utilizing the Referred By field can help you do all
this.
• User: Notice the several User fields in the bottom half of the
Contact Detail window (refer to Figure 4-1). These fields hold infor-
mation that’s specific to your business. In Chapter 13, I explain
how you can change these field names to better reflect their con-
tents. For example, you might rename User 1 to Social Security
number.
I recommend leaving these particular fields blank until you rename
them. If you don’t, you might end up with various kinds of data
entered into one field.
You can always go back and add, change, or delete field data at any time!
(See the sections “Deleting Contact Records” and “The Contacts, They
Are A’Changin’,” later in this chapter.)
6. Don’t be alarmed when ACT! automatically formats some of your field
data when you enter information.
See the later section, “Letting ACT! do the work for you: Automatic for-
matting,” for the lowdown on what ACT! does and doesn’t do for you.
7. Add your data as uniformly as possible.
Check out the later section, “Getting the most out of ACT!: Using the
drop-down lists,” to find out how to easily keep your data uniform and
yourself sane.
8. If necessary, add multiple entries to a field.
Generally, limiting yourself to one item per field is the best practice.
From time to time, however, you find a situation in which a contact falls
into two categories. For example, a contact might be both a friend and a
client. In this situation, you can use a multi-select drop-down list to
select more than one item into a field. By default, the ID/Status field is
set to be a multi-select field; Chapter 13 shows you how to create as
many multi-select fields as you’d like.
54
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

To select criteria to be included in a single field, follow these steps:
a. Place your cursor in the field.
b. Select (mark) your desired selections.
Figure 4-2 gives you an example of a drop-down list.
c. Click the desired entries from the Edit List Values dialog box.
d. Click anywhere outside the dialog box to close it.
The various entries appear in the field, separated by a comma.
9. When you fill in the information for each new contact, don’t forget to
click the various tabs at the bottom of your layout.
You find additional fields lurking on these tabs. The Home Address tab is
where you record personal information about a contact. You might have
a few other tabs that you can also choose from (see Chapter 14).
Different layouts display different tabs. If you change your current
layout, you’re probably looking at a different set of tabs. Confused?
Check out Chapter 2 for a quick refresher.
If you forget to click those tabs along the bottom of the Contact Detail
window, you just might overlook some of the fields that hold important
information. Although you can always fill them in later, it’s a good idea
to input the information while it is still fresh in your memory, so be sure
to click those tabs!
10. Save the new contact information.
Theoretically, you don’t have to save new contact information; it’s saved
if you do one of the following:
• Execute any other ACT! command, which includes anything from
adding a note or sales opportunity to scheduling an appointment.
• Move on to another record in the database.
Figure 4-2:

Although it’s not necessary, feel free to do one of the following to save
your information:
• Click the Save button (the small floppy disk icon on the toolbar).
• Press Ctrl+S.
Letting ACT! do the work for you:
Automatic formatting
Entering a new contact into the ACT! database is so easy that you might over-
look some of the magical things that happen when you begin to input contact
information. ACT! is here to help by automatically formatting some of the
contact information that you input, including
 Automatic phone number formatting: A great example of ACT!’s magic
is found in any of the phone fields. When you type in a phone number,
notice how ACT! automatically inserts the necessary parentheses and
hyphens. ACT! automatically inserts the dialing format for the United
States each time that you enter a new phone number. Have relatives
living in Turkmenistan? Have no fear: If you click the ellipsis button (the
three little dots) to the right of the Telephone field, ACT! pops open the
Enter Phone Number dialog box. By default, the country is listed as the
United States, but you can scroll through the list of the countries for just
about any country that you can think of, including Turkmenistan (see
Figure 4-3). After you click OK, the correct telephone country code and
format are applied to the telephone number.
 Automatic name formatting: Another field that ACT! automatically pro-
vides you with is the Salutation field. The Salutation field holds the text
that appears after the word Dear in a letter. For example, if you enter
Mary Ellen Van der Snob as the contact name, Mary Ellen magically
appears as the salutation. Of course, if you prefer to address your con-
tacts in a more formal manner, feel free to change Mary Ellen to Ms. Van
der Snob. When you enter a contact name into the database, ACT! auto-
matically divides it into a first, middle, and last name. Again, if you click
the ellipsis button to the right of the Contact field, ACT! shows you how
it plans to divide the contact’s name. This allows you to sort your data-
base alphabetically by last name or to look up a contact by first name.
Figure 4-3:

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

This chapter and Chapter 5 both include ways to sort your database. If
you attempt to enter a rather large, unique name, ACT! automatically
opens the Contact Name dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4, and asks you
how you want to divide the name.
ACT! is an amazingly smart and intuitive program. You might want to
input the contact name as Ms. Alyssa Fredricks or Andrea Fredricks, MD.
ACT! knows that words like Mr., Miss and Ms. are usually not first names,
and PhD, MD, and Esq. are generally not last names, so feel free to add
them to the contact name if you’d like.
 History fields: Any changes to a history field are preserved on the
History tab. Say you have six steps that you want your staff to perform
when dealing with prospects. You might change the drop-down informa-
tion for your history field to reflect those six steps. When you perform
one of the steps and you enter the information into the field, the date
and time of the change appear on the History tab so you know exactly
when each step took place.
Out of the box, only two fields — ID/Status and Last Results — are his-
tory fields. Theoretically, any field can be a history field, and Chapter 13
shows you how to do it.
 Date fields: The one thing you don’t ever want to forget is the birthday
of your significant other. However, as you discover in Chapter 6, entering
data consistently is important if you have any hope of ever finding it
again. What if an important birthday occurs in January, but you aren’t
sure whether the date was entered as January, Jan, 01, or 1? By now,
you’ve probably guessed that ACT! came up with a cure for the birthday
blues with the addition of date fields. All date fields have a drop-down
arrow, which you can click to bring up a mini-calendar, as shown in
Figure 4-5. Click the appropriate date, buy a card, and you’re ready to
roll. If you prefer, you can also manually enter the date as 01/17/05 or
1/17/05, and ACT! translates it to the calendar mode automatically.

Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

Getting the most out of ACT!: 
Using the drop-down lists
One sure-fire way to sabotage your database is to develop new and creative
ways to say the same thing. In Florida, users often vacillate between Fort, Ft,
and Ft. Lauderdale, resulting in a bad sunburn and the inability to correctly
find all their contacts. You’ll notice that several of the ACT! fields contain
drop-down lists. In these fields, you can select an item in the list, or you can
type the first few letters of an item; the field then automatically fills with the
item that matches what you typed or clicked. When you type an entry that
isn’t in the drop-down list for the Title, Department, City, and Country fields,
the item is automatically added to the list so that you can then select it for
other contacts.
You have two ways of using the drop-down lists to enter information:
 Type the first few letters of an entry that already appears in the drop-
down list, and ACT! auto-completes the word for you. For example, if you
type Bo in the City field, Boise magically appears, and if you add an S
Boston appears.
 Access the drop-down list by clicking its arrow and then choosing the
desired item(s) from the list.
Using these drop-down lists whenever possible helps ensure consistency
throughout your database. In Chapter 13, I explain how to add additional
drop-down fields to your database and control how you use them.
If you want to change the content of the drop-down lists that come with ACT!,
follow these steps:
Figure 4-5:

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

1. Click in a field that has a drop-down list.
2. Click the drop-down arrow in the field.
3. When the drop-down list appears, click the Edit List Values button.
The Edit List dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
4. In the Edit List dialog box, do one of the following:
• To add an item to the list: Click the Add button. A new blank line
appears at the bottom of the list. Enter the text that you want to
appear in the list.
• To remove an item from the list: Select an item and click the
Delete button. Click Yes when ACT! asks you to confirm the 
deletion.
• To modify an existing item: Double-click it and edit it exactly like
you would in a word processor.
5. Click OK when you finish editing your list.
That’s all there is to it. A pretty easy way to ensure consistency, don’t you
think?

Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

Duplicating Your Contacts
As you can see from the “Adding New Contacts” section, entering a new con-
tact into ACT! involves quite a few things. Thankfully, ACT! makes duplicating
a previously saved record easy.
Suppose that you just entered Jane Jones’ contact information, and now you
find yourself looking at a pile of business cards from Jane’s co-workers. All of
them have the same company name and address; the only variables are the
contact name and phone number. ACT! gives you two options for duplicating
contacts. You can either copy the primary information or all the information.
Out of the box, the primary fields are Company, Address 1, Address 2, Address 3,
City, State, Zip, Country, and Fax. When you copy all fields, every field copies
into the new contact record except the Contact and E-Mail Address fields.
To duplicate contact information without extra typing, follow these steps:
1. Open the record that you want to duplicate.
2. Choose Contact➪Duplicate Contact.
3. Select either the Duplicate Data from Primary Fields or Duplicate Data
from All Fields radio button and then click OK.
Chapter 13 shows you how to determine which fields will be used as
Primary Fields. Quite simply, these fields represent the data fields that
would be the same for each contact. If you choose the Duplicate Date from
All Fields options, you might have some strange results; it’s pretty hard to
imagine that two of your contacts would share the same birthday — and
be married to spouses with the same names!
A new contact record appears, filled in with the copied information from
the original contact record.
4. Continue creating the contact record by filling in the variable infor-
mation and proceeding as you would with an entirely new contact.
Your contact information will automatically be saved when you move on to
another contact record or switch to another ACT! view.
Deleting Contact Records
What do you do if you find that a contact is duplicated in your database? Or
that you’re no longer doing business with one of your contacts? For whatever
reason you decide that a name no longer needs to be a part of your database,
you can just delete that contact record.
60
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

ACT! allows you to either delete one contact record or a lookup of contact
records. (A lookup is the group of contacts that displays after a database
search. Peruse Chapter 6 for more information about lookups.) Just realize
that you are deleting either the current contact that you’re viewing or the
current group of contacts that you just created a lookup for. When you’re on
the contact that you want to delete, do one of the following:
 Choose Contact➪Delete.
 Press Ctrl+Delete.
 Right-click the contact record and choose Delete Contact.
Clicking the Delete Contact button deletes the current contact you’re
viewing. If you click the Delete Lookup button, you delete the current
contact lookup.
Any one of these choices brings up the warning shown in Figure 4-7.
Thinking before deleting a contact
Although the procedure is rather simple, you might want to rethink deleting
contacts. When you delete a contact, you also delete all the associated notes
and histories tied to that contact. For example, suppose that State College
uses ACT! to keep track of all prospective students that it has contacted — or
has been contacted by. State College admissions personnel receive thou-
sands of inquiries a month and fear that the database will become too large
to manage . . . and subsequently think that deleting all prospects that they
haven’t had contact with in over a year is the best course of action. However,
some of those prospects might be attending different schools that they aren’t
happy with and might want to enter State College as transfer students. Other
prospects might transfer after completing two years at a community college,
and still others might consider attending State College as graduate students.
Figure 4-7:

61
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

What to do in such a situation? I’d consider moving the contacts that you no
longer need into another archival database. That way, should the need ever
arise, you can still find all the original information on a contact without
having to start again from scratch. How nice to be able to rekindle a relation-
ship by asking, “So tell me, how did you find the accounting department at
Podunk University?” Although the setup of an archival database is beyond
the scope of this book, an ACT! Certified Consultant can assist you with this
matter.
Three warnings before deleting a contact
Losing contacts in your database is a very scary thought. You undoubtedly
rely very heavily on your ACT! database; losing that data can be potentially
devastating to your business. Worst of all, when you realize that you just acci-
dentally removed several — or even hundreds — of contacts from the data-
base, panic can set in!
Avert this panic by following these tips before you attempt to delete any of
your contacts:
 Know the difference between deleting a contact and deleting a
lookup. That way, you don’t delete numerous contacts when you want
to delete only a single record.
• Contact: The single record that you view from the Contact Detail
window.
• Lookup: The group of contacts that displays after a database
search. Chapter 6 gives you a bit more information about creating
lookups.
 Read the warning and make note of the number of contacts that
you’re about to delete. Don’t be afraid to click Cancel if a large number
of contacts start to disappear.
 Remember the three rules of computing: backup, backup, backup!
Chapter 15 provides you with instructions on how to create a backup. A
good backup provides the easiest method to restore all your information
after you accidentally deleted it.
The Contacts, They Are A’Changin’
Companies relocate and change their names, people move, and your fingers
sometimes slip on the keyboard. People change e-mail addresses. You might
want to add additional contact information for one of your contacts. All these
predicaments require the editing of contact fields. Not to worry; changing the
information that you store in ACT! is as easy as entering it in the first place.
62
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

ACT! gives you two ways of updating contact information:
 Click in the field that you want to change and then press the Delete or
Backspace key to remove the existing field information. Then simply
type in the new information.
 Highlight all the information in a field. By typing in the new information,
the old information is automatically replaced.
If you accidentally overwrite information in a single ACT! field, press Ctrl+Z to
undo the changes that you just made to that field — before you move your
cursor to another ACT! record. For those who are keyboard challenged, an
alternative is to choose Edit➪Undo from the main menu. After you move on
to another record, neither of these options are available to you.
To undo multiple changes that you make to an ACT! record, choose Edit➪
Undo Changes to Contact before you move on to the next record.
After you execute another ACT! command or move on to another record,
ACT! automatically saves the record. At that point, you can’t automatically
undo any changes you made to a contact record.

A Few Good Tabs and Lists 
In This Chapter
 Discovering ACT! lists and tabs
 Customizing ACT! lists and tabs
 Putting secondary contacts in the right place
 Linking documents to the Documents tab
T
hroughout this book, you find all the neat ways in which you can cus-
tomize ACT!. In this chapter, you discover how to change the appearance
of the various ACT! lists and tabs. And, although you encounter numerous
lists and tabs in your travels through ACT!, you’ll soon discover that you can
modify them in exactly the same way.
After you’ve seen one list or tab, you’ve seen them all! And, if you’re a
fanACTic, the lists and tabs work pretty much like they did in previous 
versions.
Meeting the Lists and Tabs
The bad news is that numerous lists and tabs are sprinkled through ACT!,
and new users might find themselves lost in a maze of windows. The good
news is that lists and tabs all have pretty much the same look and feel to
them — if you master one, you master them all!
You can find all lists by clicking View on the menu bar and then explore one
by selecting a list that sounds fun and exciting. Two of the lists — the Task
List and the Opportunity List — are so much fun that they are included in the
Nav bar running along the left side of ACT!. And, if you feel so inclined, you’re
welcome to flip back to Chapter 3 to find out how to add all the list items to
the Nav bar.

Here’s a few of the lists you’ll work with most often:
 Contact: Lists all your contacts; the list is filtered based on your current
lookup.
 Task: Lists all the tasks and activities you scheduled for all your con-
tacts; you can filter these by date, type, priority, user, public versus pri-
vate, timeless, cleared status, and Outlook relationship.
 Group: Lists all groups and can optionally include subgroups.
 Company: Lists all companies and can optionally include divisions.
 Opportunities: Lists all the sales opportunities that you enter for all
your contacts; you can filter opportunities by date, status, process,
stage, probability, amount, and public versus private.
The two types of tabs are
System tabs: These are the same for any and all layouts you use.
User tabs: You can rename and modify these to best fit the way you work
(see Chapter 14).
The system tabs are
 Notes: Lists all notes you record for the current contact, company, or
group; you can filter the notes by date, private versus public, and user.
See Chapter 7 for more on the Notes tab.
 History: Lists all correspondence, activities, and document information
that were recorded automatically by ACT! for a contact, group, or com-
pany; you can filter the histories by date, private versus public, type 
of history, and user. Turn to Chapter 7 to find out more about the
History tab.
 Activities: Lists all activities for the contact, group, or company; you can
filter the activities by date, private versus public, cleared, timeless, type
of activity, priority, and user. I go in depth about the Activities tab in
Chapter 8.
 Opportunities: Lists the financial lowdown on all the selling opportuni-
ties for the current contact, group, or company; you can filter the oppor-
tunities by date, status, private versus public, and user. Chapter 19
covers the Opportunities tab.
 Documents: Lists all files attached to the current contact, group, or com-
pany; you can’t filter this tab. See the section, “Documenting Your
Documents,” later in this chapter for more about the Documents tab.
 Contacts: Lists all the contacts associated with the current group or
company. You only see this tab in the Group Detail window or the
Company Detail window.
66
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

 Secondary Contacts: Lists the secondary contacts (for example, the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker) that are directly associ-
ated with the current contact; you can’t filter this tab. Flip ahead a few
pages to the “Corralling Your Secondary Contacts” section in this chap-
ter where I discuss the Secondary Contacts tab.
 Groups/Companies: This tab has a dual personality. You’ll notice the
addition of the Show Membership For drop-down list that lets you indi-
cate whether you want to view the groups or the companies that the
contact is associated with. This tab appears only in the Contact Detail
window.
You’ll notice that the first five tabs appear on the Contacts, Groups, and
Companies windows. That’s because you can add a note, an activity, and so
on to either an individual contact record, or to a company or group record.
Remodeling Lists and Tabs
One of the reasons that you might find the lists and tabs to be so useful is the
ease with which you can customize them. You can add or remove columns,
change the order of the columns, widen the columns, sort on any one of the
columns, and then print out your final product. In this section, I cover a few
ways in which you can change the look of your lists and tabs.
67
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists
Minding your filters!
When viewing the various system tabs, you
must be aware of the effect that the filters have
on what information you see — or don’t see. In
ACT!, you can choose to filter information or to
include it. Different tabs have different filters;
however, all tabs include a date filter and a user
filter. If the filter is set to show only items in the
future and you have an activity scheduled for
today, you don’t see today’s activity. And, if you
schedule an activity but you set the filter to
include only Alyssa’s activities, you don’t see
your activity either.
When frustrated, check your filters! You might
be puzzled at the fact that information you just
know has been entered into the database has
mysteriously disappeared. This becomes
increasingly important on the Activities tab,
which contains several filter options (including
three buried away behind the Option button).
The Task and Opportunity lists can be even
more confusing; these lists contain a variety of
filter options — all of which can be hidden away
with one click of the Hide Filters button.

Adding or removing columns
Probably the first thing that you want to do to modify your lists and columns
is to add or remove a column — or two or three! Follow these steps:
1. Click the Options button (in the top-right corner) on any list or tab
and choose Customize Columns from the menu that appears.
The Customize Columns dialog box appears (see Figure 5-1).
Because variety is the spice of life, you right-clickers will also find that
you can right-click any of the ACT! lists or tabs to get to the Customize
Columns dialog box.
2. Select the field (column) that you want to add by clicking the appro-
priate choice in the Available Fields list.
Depending on the list or tab you’re working with, you see various field
choices. Feel free to include as many or as few as your little heart
desires.
3. Click the single right-pointing arrow.
If you’re really into seeing a lot of information, you can click the double
right-pointing arrows; that adds all available fields to your list or tab.
4. To remove an item, click the appropriate choice from the Show as
Columns in This Order list and then click the single left-pointing
arrow.
If you really want to get rowdy, click the double left-pointing arrows to
remove all the current fields. You might do this if you have an over-
whelming desire to start from scratch.
5. Click the Close button when you’re done.
Figure 5-1:
Adding
columns to
the Contact
List.
68
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Changing the order and width of columns 
You can change the order of the fields from the Customize Columns dialog
box that I show you how to access in the preceding section. Click the appro-
priate choice from the Show as Columns in This Order list and click the Move
Up or Move Down buttons.
The order in which items appear in the Customize Columns dialog box is
exactly the way they appear in your final product. Knock yourself out, arrange
and rearrange all you want, and sleep peacefully knowing that if you don’t like
the outcome you can always change it again. Now, if I could just do that with
my living room!
You can also drag and drop the various column headings to change the order
in which columns appear on the lists and tabs. For example, if you want the
Date field to appear before the Time field, simply click the Time column head-
ing and drag the heading over to the left of the Date column heading. As you
start to drag one of the columns, a black vertical line appears, indicating the
intended location of the column.
Changing the width of a column is just as easy. If you move your mouse on
the line between any two column headings, your cursor transforms into a
double-headed arrow. When that arrow appears, hold down your left mouse
button and drag to the left or right to narrow or widen a column. The column
to the left of your mouse changes width.
Sorting your lists and tabs
In general, I hate terms like automatic and click of a button because your
vision of automatic might be quite different from that of a software engineer.
That said, sorting the entries in any of your lists and tabs is, well, automatic
and can be done with the click of a button: Just click the column heading that
you want to use to sort the list. Want the contacts in your Contact list sorted
alphabetically by city? Click the City column heading. Change your mind and
want it sorted by ZIP code instead? Click the Zip Code column heading.
ACT! automatically separates the contact’s name into a first and a last name.
When you click the Contact column heading in any of the lists or tabs, you’ll
notice that your information is sorted by last name so that Andrea Fredricks
appears alphabetically with the Fs rather than with the As.
69
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

When you click a column heading, an up arrow appears indicating that the
contacts are sorted in ascending order (in alphabetical, A–Z, or 1–10 order).
To reverse the sort order, click the column heading again. If the list is sorted
in ascending order, contacts that have no information in the selected column
appear at the top of the list. In descending order, they appear at the bottom
of the list.
Sorting your contacts is so simple that you might decide to get really adven-
turous and sort based on another criterion. Go ahead — I dare you! Click any
column heading to re-sort the list by the field of your choice. Want to have
your Contact List sorted by more than one criterion? Sneak a peak at the final
section of this chapter for a crash course.
Contacting the Contact List
The Contact List is a good way to view your contacts if you’re working with
large numbers of contacts at one time. Changing the columns that appear in
the Contact List provides you with a way of comparing information between
your various contacts. For example, you might want to see how many of your
contacts purchased each of your products, and have the name of each prod-
uct appear in the Contact List, along with their telephone number.
Getting to the Contact List is half the fun
The road to the Contact List is simple to follow — just choose View➪
Contact List. A list of your contacts appears, displayed in columns as shown
in Figure 5-2.
When you come across a contact record in your list that requires a bit of
tweaking, you might want to flip to the Contact Detail window to make your
changes. You can get to the Contact Detail window in a number of ways:
 Double-click a contact in the Contact List.
 Right-click the contact and choose Look Up Selected Contacts.
 Click the Back button on the Back and Forward bar if you were just in
the Contact Detail window.
The Contact Detail window appears with the selected contact’s record. To
return to the Contact List, choose View➪Contact List or click the Back button
on the Back and Forward bar.

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Finding a contact in the Contact List
In Chapter 6, I show you how to create a lookup to find contacts that meet
your specific criteria. The Contact List also allows you to go to a specific con-
tact record in the blink of an eye. Here’s what you need to do:
1. Click the column heading to select that column.
For example, if you want to find a contact by last name, click the Contact
column heading.
2. Start typing the first few letters of the contact information that you
want to find in the Look For text field.
If you click the Contact column heading, start typing the first few letters
of the contact’s last name. If you click the Company Name column head-
ing, type in the first few letters of the company that you’re looking for.
ACT! scrolls down the Contact List to the closest match. For example, if
you sorted the list by contact and typed the letter s, you might land on
the Colonel Sanders contact record. If you typed sm, you’re probably
looking at all your Smiths.
3. Continue typing until you reach the contact for whom you are looking.
Figure 5-2:
The ACT!
Contact List.
71
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

Tagging contacts in the Contact List
Using the Contact List, you can easily select — or tag — contacts to manually
create a lookup of your contacts. For example, say that you want to target
some of your best clients for a special promotion; a general lookup probably
doesn’t produce a list of those contacts because you don’t have a field that
includes special promotions. Instead, you can tag those contacts based on
your own instincts.
To switch to Tag mode, just make sure that a check mark is showing next to
the Enable Tag Mode option, which is located at the top of the Contact List.
You can do the following things in Tag mode:
 Tag a contact. Click anywhere in the contact; a gray bar appears across
the contact record indicating that you tagged it. Figure 5-3 shows tagged
contacts.
 Untag a contact. Click anywhere in a tagged contact, and the gray bar
disappears.
 Tag a continuous list of names. Click the first name in the list that
you’re selecting, and then press the Shift key while clicking the last
name in the list that you’re selecting. All the names between the first
name and the last name that you’re selecting are automatically tagged.
Figure 5-3:
Selected
contacts in
Tag mode.
72
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Notice the four buttons to the right of the Enable Tag Mode option (refer to
Figure 5-3). After you tag the contacts that you want to work with or those
that you want to omit temporarily, choose one of the following four buttons:
 Tag All: Allows you to select all the contacts currently showing in the
Contact List.
 Untag All: Allows you to deselect any contacts that you already selected.
 Lookup Selected: Allows you to create a lookup based on the contacts
that you tag.
 Omit Selected: Allows you to remove the contacts that you select from
the Contact List. Don’t panic — it does not remove the contacts perma-
nently from your database!
If you need to print out any lists or tabs, flip to Chapter 9 for the lowdown on
Quick Reports.
Corralling Your Secondary Contacts
Does this scenario sound familiar? You have a main contact, but of course that
person, being the big cheese, is rarely available so you often have to work with
his assistant. But of course the assistant can’t do any true decision making, so
you might need to speak to Mr. Big’s sales manager on occasion. And, when the
sales manager goes on vacation, you need to call the assistant sales manager.
Yikes! The Secondary Contacts tab, as shown in Figure 5-4, allows you to store
all the pertinent information about Mr. Big and his partners in crime in the
same area so you don’t have to go on a wild goose chase hunting down names,
telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses. And, just like promotions that often
happen, you can “promote” a secondary contact into a main contact.
Not sure whether you should add a contact as a primary or a secondary con-
tact? You might want to think of how you are going to use the secondary con-
tact. If you just want to be able to access an assistant’s phone number, then
the assistant is a good candidate for entry as a secondary contact. However,
if you want to be able to e-mail your monthly newsletter to the assistant or
include her in some of your mail merges, you need to add the assistant as a
primary contact record instead.
Figure 5-4:
The
Secondary
Contacts
tab.
73
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

Adding a secondary contact
Of course, you can’t add a secondary contact until you create a main contact
(see Chapter 4 to do so). After you create the head honcho’s contact record,
here’s what you do to create the secondary contact record(s):
1. From the Contact Detail window, click the Secondary Contacts tab.
2. Click the New Secondary Contact button on the top of the Secondary
Contacts tab.
The New Secondary Contact dialog box appears (see Figure 5-5).
3. Fill in all the juicy details for the secondary contact.
Although you don’t fill in quite as much information as you can for a
main contact, you do have all the really pertinent fields. Don’t forget to
click the Business Address tab for even more fields.
4. Click OK to create the secondary contact.
Congratulations! Your main contact has now given birth to a secondary con-
tact. All the secondary contacts that you create appear on the Secondary
Contacts tab of the primary contact.
If you need to go back and edit or add information for the secondary contact,
just double-click the name from the Secondary Contact list and voilà, you’re
back to the Secondary Contact dialog box.

Deleting a secondary contact
Sorry to say, but some of the secondary contacts might drift off into the
sunset, leaving you with the need to remove them from your database. Not to
worry; you can delete a secondary contact by following the bouncing ball
through these steps:
1. Click the Secondary Contacts tab from the Contact Detail window.
2. Right-click the contact you want to delete and then choose Delete.
You can never say that ACT! doesn’t give you ample warning before
deleting a contact. As usual, when you attempt to delete even a sec-
ondary contact ACT! shows you a scary warning.
3. Click Yes to delete the selected secondary contact.
Promoting a secondary contact
Promoting, promotion — it has a lovely ring to it, don’t you think? That lowly
assistant might be promoted through the ranks and some day become the
“big guy” — or at the very least a more important contact than he/she is
today. If you’re worried that you have to reenter all that basic information in
again, don’t be. Just promote the contact by following these steps:
1. Click the Secondary Contacts tab in the Contact Detail window.
2. Select the secondary contact that you want to promote.
3. Right-click and choose Promote from the menu.
The Promote Secondary Contact dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
4. Select whether to duplicate the main contact’s primary fields.
With promotions come responsibilities and decisions. If the secondary
contact is sliding into the role of the current primary contact, you want
to copy all of the primary contact’s information to the record of the
newly promoted contact. If, however, the secondary contact doesn’t
have the same basic information as the primary contact, you can choose
not to copy the primary fields.
5. Click OK.

Documenting Your Documents
No matter how organized you think your documents might be, you probably
occasionally misplace one of them. Of course you can always have Windows
search for it, but ACT! offers an easier — and faster solution. The Documents
tab, which you can find on the Contacts, Groups, or Companies windows,
allows you to attach any and all of your files related to the current contact,
group, or company. You can add a proposal created in Excel, a contract cre-
ated in Word, or even a PDF file that you scanned into your computer. By
adding them to the Documents tab, as shown in Figure 5-7, you are actually
cloning the original file and placing it in your ACT! database.
After you add a document to the Documents tab, you can open the file
directly from ACT! to view, edit, or print. You can also link the same docu-
ment to multiple records. Removing a file from the Documents tab does not
remove the original document from your computer.
Adding a document
Adding a file to the Documents tab is very easy, and considering the time you
save down the road, well worth the effort. Just follow these steps:
1. Display the contact, group, or company record to which you want to
add a document.
2. Click the Documents tab.
Figure 5-7:

3. Click the Add Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area and then choose Add
Document from the menu.
The Attach File dialog box opens.
4. Browse to the document you want to add, select it, and then click
Open.
ACT! adds the document to your ACT! database and displays the file-
name, size, type, and last modified date on the Documents tab. Because
the document is now part of your database, remote synchronization
users can now access the document as well.
You can also drag and drop a file to the Documents tab from Windows Explorer
or My Computer by dragging the document’s icon to the Documents tab.
Opening a document
The true benefit of adding documents to the Documents tab is the speed in
which you can open the documents that pertain to a specific contact, group,
or company. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Documents tab.
2. Select the document you want to open.
3. Click the Edit Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area and choose Edit
Document from the menu.
Magically, the program associated with the document opens, revealing the
document. You’re on you own here — just remember that you can now
edit, save, or print the document as you normally do. Any changes you
make are reflected the next time you open the document through ACT!.
Removing a document
After you add a file to the Documents tab, you might change your mind and
decide to make it go am-scray. Easy come, easy go. Follow these steps to rid
yourself of the offending document:
1. Display the contact, group, or company record that contains the docu-
ment you want to eliminate.
2. Click the Documents tab.
3. In the Document List, select the document you want to remove.
77
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

4. Click the Remove Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area and then choose
Remove Document from the menu.
ACT! makes sure you want to remove the document by presenting a
warning. Software programs very often present you with scary messages
before deleting important information. This is a good thing. Heed the
warnings!
ACT! deletes the document permanently from the database. And,
because the document doesn’t end up in the Recycle Bin, think very
carefully before deleting the document.
5. Click Yes to confirm that you really, truly want to remove the 
document.
If you originally created the document somewhere in your computer, the 
document is still there. However, if you are a sync user who received the doc-
ument as part of the synchronization process, you might want to first open
the document and save it to your computer before removing it from the
Documents tab — otherwise, it’s gone for good!
Changing the Order of Columns
By default, ACT! automatically sorts your data alphabetically by the company
name. If you open the Contact List, you see your contacts listed there in com-
pany order. Scroll to the first contact in the Contacts view — that contact
probably works at a company that starts with the letter A. But, like just about
all of ACT!, you can change that order.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, by default, your contacts are sorted
alphabetically by the Company column. You can see this two different ways:
 A small triangle appears in the Company column heading in the Contact
List.
 Companies starting with the letter A appear before those starting with
the letter B as you scroll through your contacts.
Although the Contact List provides you with a quick-as-a-bunny way to sort
your contacts, it sorts the contacts based on the contents of a single field. If
you want to sort your contacts based on multiple criteria, you have another
way to do it:
78
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

1. Choose Edit➪Sort from either the Contact List or Contact Detail
window.
The Sort dialog box appears (see Figure 5-8).
2. Choose an option from the Sort By drop-down list to specify the first-
level sort criterion.
3. Select the sorting order (Ascending or Descending).
Ascending sort order means from A–Z or from the smallest number to
the largest number. Records with no information in the field used for the
sort appear first. Descending means from Z–A or from the largest number
to the smallest number. Records with no information in the field used for
the sort appear last.
4. Choose a second field option from the And Then By drop-down list
and specify Ascending or Descending.
5. If you want a third level of sorting, choose a field from the And
Finally By drop-down list and specify Ascending or Descending.
6. Click OK.
Figure 5-8:
Set your
sort here.
79
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists
Why don’t my contacts sort correctly?
At times, your contacts might appear to not
alphabetize correctly. Possible reasons for this
include
 A stray mark or a blank space leads the
field name. For example, ’Zinger & Co.
appears alphabetically in front of Gadgets
R Us.
 Numbers appear alphabetically in front of
letters. For example, 1st Financial Savings
& Loan appears alphabetically in front of
AAA Best Bank.
 ACT! might be a little confused about the
first and last name of a contact. A quick trip
to the Contact Detail window is worth your
time. Click the ellipsis button next to the
Contact’s name and then double-check that
the correct first and last names appear in
the appropriate spots.

The ACT! Lookup: Searching 
for Your Contacts
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basic ACT! lookup

 Performing advanced queries
I
f all roads lead to Rome, then surely all processes in ACT! lead to the
lookup. A lookup is a way of looking at only a portion of the contacts in
your database, depending on your specifications. A good practice in ACT! is
to perform a lookup first and then perform an action second. For example,
you might perform a lookup and then print some labels. Or you might do a
lookup and then perform a mail merge. Need a report? Do a lookup first! In
this chapter, I show you how to perform lookups based on contact informa-
tion, notes and history information, and advanced query information.
ACT! Is Looking Up
The theory behind the lookup is that you don’t always need to work with all
your contacts at one time. Not only is working with only a portion of your
database easier; at times, doing so is absolutely necessary. If you’re changing
your mailing address, you probably want to send a notification to everyone 
in your database. Comparatively, if you’re running a special sales promotion,
you probably notify only your prospects and customers. And if you’re send-
ing out overpriced holiday gift baskets, you probably want the names of only
your very best customers.

Most computer programs use the term “query” to indicate the result of a
database search. However, ACT! generally uses the term “lookup.”  Feel free
to use the terms interchangeably.
In ACT!, you can focus on a portion of your contacts by
 Creating basic lookups based on the information in one of the nine most-
commonly used contact fields in ACT!. (See the later section, “Performing
Basic Lookups.”)
 Conducting a query based on information stored in your groups, compa-
nies, and opportunities. (See the later section, “Searching Your Groups,
Companies, and Opportunities.”)
 Creating lookups based on information from other areas in your data-
base including notes, histories, activities, annual events, and contact
activity. (See the later section, “Performing Special ACT! Lookups.”)
 Creating your own, more advanced, queries based on the parameters of
your own choosing by using logical operators. (See the later section,
“Creating Advanced Queries.”)
Performing Basic Lookups
The easiest way to pose a query is to choose one of your main contact fields
from a menu and then fill in the search criteria. Although this way is easy
because the menus guide you, it’s also the least flexible way. The Lookup
menu that ACT! provides is probably the best — and simplest — place to
start when creating a lookup; just follow these steps:
82
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 
Don’t create an extra database — 
Use the ACT! lookup instead
Some ACT! users originally create several data-
bases, not realizing that one database can be
used to store information about various types of
contacts. Although you might want to create
two separate databases — for instance, one for
customers and one for vendors — a better
alternative is to include both your customers
and vendors together in one database. To this
one database, you can then add a few miscel-
laneous contacts, including prospects who
aren’t yet customers or referral sources that
might lead to new customers. Just make sure
that each contact is identified in some specific
way; I recommend using the ID/Status field.
Then when you want to see only vendors or only
prospective customers, simply perform a lookup
to work with just that particular group of 
contacts.

1. Choose the Lookup menu from the Contact Detail window.
Figure 6-1 shows you the Lookup menu that drops down and the criteria
that you can use to perform your lookup.
2. Choose one of the criteria listed in Figure 6-1 to create a basic lookup.
The ACT! Lookup Contacts dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.
3. If you’re searching based on an Other field, click the Look in This
Field drop-down arrow and choose a field from the drop-down list.
Figure 6-2:
The ACT!
Lookup
Contacts
dialog box.
Figure 6-1:

83
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

If you come from a long line of right-clickers, you might prefer to simply
right-click whatever field for which you want to create a lookup and then
click Lookup. Sharp as a tack, ACT! opens up the Lookup Contacts dialog
box, with your field already selected in the Look in This Field text box.
4. In the For the Current Lookup area, select an option:
• Replace Lookup: Creates a brand-new lookup based on your 
criteria.
• Add to Lookup: Adds the contacts based on your criteria to an
existing lookup. For example, if you create a lookup for your con-
tacts based in Chicago, select this option to add your New York
clients to the set of Chicago clients.
• Narrow Lookup: Refines a lookup based on a second criterion. For
example, if you create a lookup of all your customers, you could
select this option to narrow the lookup to only those customers
based in Philadelphia.
5. In the Search For area, select an option:
• Company: Type the word to search for or select a word from the
drop-down list to look for contacts that match a specific criterion.
• Empty Field: If you’re looking for contacts who don’t have any data
in the given field — for example, people who don’t have an e-mail
address — choose this option.
• Non-Empty Field: If you want to find only those contacts who have
data in a given field — for example, everyone who has an e-mail
address — choose this option.
When typing in the match criterion, remember that with ACT!, less is
more. ACT! automatically searches by the beginning of your string. For
example, in the sample database for this book, typing Tech returns Tech
Benders and Technology Consultants. However, typing Technology
returns only Technology Consultants.
6. Click OK.
If only one contact record matches your search criteria, that’s the
record that you see. However, if several contact records match your cri-
teria, the Contact List appears with a list of all your matches. In either
case, the record counter now reflects the number of contacts that match
your search criteria.
7. Choose Lookup➪All Contacts when you’re ready to once again view
all the contacts in your database.
Don’t panic right after performing a lookup, wondering what happened to the
rest of your contacts. You can always reassure yourself by doing a lookup of
All Contacts after each and every one of your lookups. Although this won’t
hurt anything, this step is entirely unnecessary. After you finish working with
your current lookup, you can simply wait until you need to create another
lookup. Just do a lookup for your next criterion and save yourself a step.
84
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Searching Your Groups, Companies, 
and Opportunities
Probably the most common lookups you create are based on your contact
fields. However, you aren’t limited to searching by just those fields. You can
also query your groups, companies, and opportunities for key information.
The best part is that all three queries work in pretty much the same way.
Grappling with your groups
When performing a Group lookup, you might look for the name of one spe-
cific group or for a group or groups that all contain the same information. In
other words, I might look for all groups whose names start with Technology,
or I might look for all groups that are located in New York City. To find the
groups that match your search criteria, here’s all you need to do:
1. Choose Lookup➪Groups and then choose from the following options:
• All Groups: Opens the Group List showing you a list of all the
groups in your database.
• Name: Finds all groups that match the name you specify.
• Other Fields: Allows you to search through any and all group fields
for the groups that match your desired criterion. The list shows all
group fields that you can search in the database.
• Save Lookup as Group: If you just created a lookup (as described
in the previous section) and want to save your results into a new
group, this is your option. You can also see other ways to create
Groups in Chapter 20.
85
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts
Playing the wild card
Some of you old-timers might remember that an
asterisk (*) was the DOS wild card. That same
concept exists in Structured Query Language
(SQL)-based products like ACT! except that the
percent sign (%) replaced the asterisk (for some
reason known only to the technical gods).
Say you’re trying to find all companies that are
carpet cleaners. If you create a lookup using the
word carpet, you find Carpet Cleaning by
Joanne Chamar but not Joanne’s Carpet
Cleaning. Enter the wild card and create your
lookup using %carpet. ACT! finds companies
that both begin and end with carpet.

If you choose the All Groups or Save Lookup as Group option, you’re fin-
ished. If you choose the Name or Other Fields option, the Lookup Groups
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-3. You have to continue along
your merry way following these remaining steps:
2. In the Look in This Field area, select the Group field you want to
query from the drop-down list.
3. In the Search For area, type the word to search for or select a word
from the drop-down list.
4. In the For the Current Lookup area, select the Replace Lookup option.
5. Click OK.
Like magic, the Group List pops open, displaying a list of all the groups
that match your specifications.
Calling all companies
Hopefully, creating a lookup of companies seems vaguely familiar because it
is so similar to creating a group lookup. To find the companies that match
your search criteria, here’s all you need to do: Choose Lookup➪Companies
and then choose from one of the following options:
 All Companies: Opens the Company List showing you a list of all the
companies in your database.
 Name
 Main Phone
 City
 State
 Zip Code
Figure 6-3:
The Lookup
Groups
dialog box.
86
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

 ID/Status: Just like you use the ID/Status field to classify each of your
contacts into a separate category, assign your companies an ID/Status.
For example, if one of your company ID/Status options is wholesale, it’s a
snap to find all your “wholesale” companies.
 Other Fields: Provides you with a drop-down list of all your company
fields.
 Save Lookup as Company: Lets you create a company based on the cur-
rently displayed contacts. Chapter 21 will show you how to create a
company.
The Company Lookup works the same way as the Group Lookup. If you
choose the All Companies or Save Lookup as Company option, you’re
finished. If you choose any of the other options, the Lookup Companies
dialog box opens. From there, you can follow the same steps that you
did for the Group Lookup.
Ogling your opportunities
Those of you who won’t be using ACT! to help keep track of all your past,
pending, and future sales can skip this next section. However, if your com-
pany has an active sales force, you’ll want to run (don’t walk) to Chapter 19
to read everything there is to know about ACT!’s cool Opportunity feature.
After an opportunity is created, you can search through all your sales oppor-
tunities in a variety of ways.
1. Choose Lookup➪Opportunities.
2. Choose one of the following options:
• All Opportunities: Opens the Opportunities List, showing you a
list of all the opportunities in your database.
• Name: Finds opportunities that match the name you specify.
Typically, you want to use the quote number as the name of your
quote so that you can lookup based on that criterion. Chapter 20
shows you how to name your quotes.
• Stage: Finds opportunities that match a specific sales stage.
• Product: Finds opportunities that pertain to a specific product.
• Total: Finds opportunities that match the total sale you specify.
You can also search for opportunities that are larger or smaller
than a specified dollar amount.
• Status: Finds opportunities that match a specific sales status.
87
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

• Record Manager: Lets you find any of the opportunities that are
associated with any one particular user.
• Other Fields: Finds all opportunities that match any other oppor-
tunity fields, including the eight opportunity fields that you can
customize.
If you choose the first option, you’re whisked away to the Opportunity
List. If you opt for one of the other options, the Lookup Opportunities
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4. If you’re getting bored, I apol-
ogize — ACT! is just so darned consistent that you’re probably finding
that querying your sales opportunities is every bit as easy as any of the
other lookups I cover throughout this chapter.
3. From the Look in This Field drop-down list, select the field on which
you wish to search.
The list shows all opportunity fields that you can search.
4. In the Search For area, type the word to search for or select a word
from the drop-down list.
For example, if you’re looking for all opportunities that are in the
Negotiation stage, select Stage from the Look in This Field drop-down
list and Negotiation from the Search For drop-down list. To find out how
well your chocolate cake is selling, choose Product from the Look in
This Field drop-down and Chocolate Cake from the Search For box.
5. Select Replace Lookup from the For the Current Lookup drop-down
list.
6. Click OK.
Although you might be as happy as a little clam using the Opportunity
lookup, you can achieve the same results by filtering your Opportunity List.
Filtering might even make you ecstatic because you’ll probably find it a bit
easier and much more flexible. Chapter 5 shows you how to filter your
Opportunities List. Chapter 19 will further astonish you when it reveals some
of the other great Opportunity party tricks!

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Performing Special ACT! Lookups
The ability to perform a simple lookup based on a single field criterion is an
element common to most databases, but ACT! isn’t your average database. All
databases contain fields, but only special databases contain things such as
notes and activities. And after creating a note to store a useful tidbit of infor-
mation (which I show you how to do in Chapter 7), you might want to find that
information again. Some of you might want to use ACT! to send monthly birth-
day and anniversary greetings. ACT! provides you with three special query
options to find information that was entered into ACT! in a special way.
Searching by keyword
A keyword search can be an extremely useful way to find data about your 
contacts no matter where that information might be lurking. In fact, I’ve
gotten many ACT! users to start calling this search the “Senior Moment”
Search. As your database increases, you might find yourself in a situation 
in which you can only remember one tiny piece of information about a con-
tact. ACT!’s keyword search enables you to dig for that information in the
Activities, Opportunities, Histories, Notes, and Fields portions of ACT!. For
example, suppose that you’re looking for someone to design a new logo for
your business but you can’t remember where you stored that information. Is
logo part of the company’s name, did you enter it into the ID/Status field, or
did you stick it in a note somewhere? A keyword search searches throughout
your database, checking all fields, until it finds the word logo.
Here’s how to perform a keyword search:
1. From the Contact Detail window, choose Lookup➪Keyword Search.
The Keyword Search dialog box opens (see Figure 6-5).
2. In the Search For area, enter the key piece of information that you’re
searching for.
3. In the Record Type drop-down list, indicate whether you’re looking
for a Contact, Group, or Company record.
4. In the Search These Records area, choose an option:
• All Records: ACT! sifts through all records in your database.
• Current Record: ACT! searches only the record that was onscreen
when you opened the dialog box. Use this option if you know that
somewhere in the deep, dark past, you entered a specific tidbit of
information as a note.
• Current Lookup: ACT! searches only the records that you selected
in your most recent lookup.
89
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

5. In the Look In area, select all options that apply.
The keyword search is a powerful searching tool, and it does take a bit
longer to run than other searching methods. When you perform a key-
word search, ACT! sifts through every last bit of information in your
database, hoping to find a match that fits your specifications.
To speed up the process, limit the amount of elements to search.
• Activities: Searches in your activities
• Opportunities: Searches the information on the Opportunities tab
• Histories: Searches through the histories that ACT! created
• Notes: Searches in the notes you created
• Fields: Searches through all your contact fields
6. After making all your choices, click the Find Now button.
ACT! responds with a list of records, similar to what’s shown in Figure
6-6. The lookup results show the contact’s name and company, the field
in which ACT! finds the matching data, and the data that it finds. For
example, if you search for the word ACT, your search includes such
diverse words as interactive and contractor because the letters act
appear in the middle of these words.
Figure 6-5:

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

7. Decide what you want to do with the results.
Like the old saying goes, be careful what you search for because you just
might find it! Okay, the saying doesn’t go exactly like that, but after you
find a number of records using the keyword search, you must decide
which one(s) to focus on. Here are some of your options:
• Click the Create Lookup button to see all the records in the
Contact Detail window.
• Double-click any part of a single record, and you land on that con-
tact record. To get back to your search, double-click the Keyword
Search tab that now appears in the bottom-left corner of the
Contact Detail window.
• Select multiple adjacent records by clicking the first record, press-
ing Shift, and then clicking the last record. Right-click one of your
selections and choose Lookup Selected Records. You now have a
lookup that consists of only the contacts that you selected.
• Select records that aren’t adjacent by clicking the first record,
pressing Ctrl, and then clicking the other records that you want.
Right-click one of your selections and choose Lookup Selected
Records. You now have a lookup that consists of only the contacts
that you selected.

Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

Annual event lookups
In Chapter 13, I show you how to create Annual Event fields. Annual events
help automate the processes of tracking important dates, such as birthdays
or anniversaries. When you enter a date in an Annual Event field, ACT! auto-
matically tracks the event date from year to year. Because annual events
don’t appear on your calendar, you must perform an Annual Event lookup to
display them. You can use the Annual Event lookup to generate a printed list
to display events for the current week, the current month, or a specified date
range.
Combining the power of an Annual Event lookup with an ACT! mail merge is a
great way to save lots of time. Birthdays and anniversaries are good examples
of annual events; like it or not, they happen once per year. The Annual Event
lookup tracks them all down regardless of the year. You fellows out there will
be happy to know that you need only ask a woman her birthday, regardless of
the year. (I show you how to perform a mail merge in Chapter 11.)
Here’s all you need to do to create an Annual Event lookup:
1. From the Contact Detail window, choose Lookup➪Annual Events.
The Annual Events Search dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-7.
2. Select an annual event from the Search For drop-down list.
If you’ve added more than one annual event field to your database, you
can search for more than one of them at a time by selecting each one or
by selecting the All option to search through all your annual event fields.
Figure 6-7:
The Annual

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

For example, you might want to find everyone who has either a birthday
or anniversary in the month of June.
3. Choose a Time Range option in which you want to search.
Your options are the current week or month, or a selected date range.
4. Click the Find Now button.
The results appear in the lower half of the Annual Events Search dialog
box. Your results vary, depending on the number of contacts that meet
your search criteria. If no contacts meet your search criteria, you
receive a message nicely telling you so.
5. Click one of the following option buttons:
• Go To Contact: Go to the contact record of the selected contact.
• Create Lookup: Create a lookup of all the contacts.
• Schedule To-Do: Schedule an activity for the selected contacts.
Unfortunately, you can schedule only one activity at a time.
• Print List: Print a list of the contacts.
Searching by contact activity
I’ve often estimated that at least 20 percent of the average database consists
of long-lost contact information. You can either ignore these forlorn contacts,
or you might realize that there’s gold in them thar hills! What if you could 
find all the contacts that you haven’t contacted in, say, the last two years?
Chances are that many of those contacts will be glad to hear from you.
Maybe they lost your contact information or chose a company other than
yours that they weren’t happy with. Suddenly those “lost” contacts have
become a virtual treasure trove.
You can create a lookup of contacts based on the last time that you made any
changes to their record or contacted them through a meeting, call, or to-do.
You can look for the contacts that either have or have not been changed
within a specified date range. You can also narrow the search according to
activity or history type.
To create a lookup by contact activity, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lookup➪Contact Activity.
The Contact Activity dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-8.
93
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

2. Select either Not Changed or Changed in the Look for Contacts That
Have area.
The neat thing about using the Contact Activity lookup is that you can
look for “touched” or “untouched” contacts. In other words, you can
search for all the contacts that you contacted in a certain time frame or
for all the contacts that you didn’t contact in a certain time frame.
3. Select a date.
The date tells ACT! to look for records that have been changed — or not
changed — since that date.
4. Select one or more options in the Search In area to narrow your
search.
You can search in the following areas of ACT!:
• Contact fields
• Notes
• Opportunities
• Histories
• Activities
If you decide to search through your History and/or Activities tabs, you
can even indicate which specific types of histories or activities you want
to include in your search.
Many users make the mistake of using only a portion of ACT! — and then
find out later that they can’t take advantage of some of its coolest fea-
tures. In order for this search to work, you have to input information in
the appropriate spots. For example, you can’t look for modified
Opportunities if you never created them!
Figure 6-8:
The Contact
Activity

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

5. Click OK.
ACT! searches for the selected field or activity that was/was not modi-
fied within the specified date range. The Contact List appears and dis-
plays your selection.
ACT! searches through all your contact fields, notes, histories, and
opportunities, so it might take a moment or two to create your search
results. Relax and practice a few deep-breathing exercises while you
wait.
In Chapter 4, I mention some of the system fields; these are the fields that
ACT! fills in for you automatically. These fields are easily identifiable because
they are grayed out. Although you can’t change the information in these
fields, you are free to create lookups on them. For example, every time you
change any of the information for a contact, ACT! automatically updates the
Edit Date field. Feel free to give any of the system fields a right-click and
search on them. For example, if you’re looking for all the contacts that have
been created since before or after a given date, give the Create Date field a
right-click!
Creating Advanced Queries
You might want to consider the final two lookup options to be “powerful” and
not “advanced”; many of you might associate advanced with difficult, and that
is certainly not the case here.
If you need to base your lookup on multiple criteria, you can perform a basic
lookup and then use the Narrow or Add To Lookup options (refer to Figure
6-2) in the Lookup Contacts dialog box to create a more specific search. This
option works fine if you’re willing to create several lookups until you reach
the desired results. A better alternative is to use a query to create a lookup. A
query searches all the contacts in your database based on the multiple crite-
ria that you specify and then creates a lookup of contacts that match those
criteria.
Looking up by example
The Lookup by Example function allows you to create an exact profile for the
contacts you’re hoping to find. For example, you might look for all customers
in the state of Arizona who expressed interest in a specific product. When
you create a Lookup by Example, ACT! responds by presenting you with a
blank contact record and lets you specify the fields and values that define the
query.
95
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

This is what you do:
1. Choose Lookup➪By Example.
The Lookup By Example window opens. The Lookup By Example
window, as shown in Figure 6-9, looks just like any other contact record
with one major difference — all the fields are blank.
2. Click in the field that you want to query.
You can create a query on virtually any field in your database. Don’t
forget to check out some of those neat fields that might be located on
your various layout tabs. For example, the Contact Info tab contains 
the Record Manager and Create Date fields, which are common things 
to query.
3. Fill in any criteria on which you want to search.
Fill in as many criteria as you need. The whole purpose of doing a
Lookup by Example is that you’re looking for contacts that fit more than
one criterion. If you’re looking for all customers who are located in
Arizona, type customer in the ID/Status field and AZ in the State field.
4. Click the Search button when you are ready to put ACT! to work dig-
ging through all your contact records.

The Advanced Query
After you use your database for a while and it slowly but surely fills up with
more and more contacts, you might feel the need to add a little more power
to your lookups. You also might find yourself constantly creating the same
lookup and wish to save it to save yourself a little time later on. In fact, you
might even start using the term query, which is computer-speak for fancy
lookup. Fortunately for you, although an Advanced Query packs a lot of
power, it’s still a piece of cake to run. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Lookup➪Advanced➪Advanced Query.
The Advanced Query window opens up, as shown in Figure 6-10.
2. Select Contact or Opportunity from the Type drop-down list.
3. Select one of the available contact or opportunity fields from the Field
Name drop-down list.
To make life easy for you, you find all your fields listed in the Field Name
drop-down list.
4. Select one of the operators in the Operator field.
Knock yourself out! Indicate whether you’re looking for a specific word,
a field that contains a part of a word, or even a range of figures or dates.
5. In the Value field, select one of the available items that corresponds to
the selected Field Name item.
If the Field has a drop-down list, you’ll be happy to discover that it is
also available in the Advanced Query window.
Figure 6-10:
The
Advanced
Query
window.
97
Chapter 6: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

6. Click the Add to List button.
The query criteria appear in the columns in the middle part of the
Advanced Query window.
7. To select more than one criterion, repeat Steps 2–6.
8. Optionally, click in the And/Or column for the item and select an
option if necessary.
As you build the query, you might want to make use of the And/Or
column to help you group your criteria to indicate the relationship
between each set of criteria. In Figure 6-10, notice that the two state cri-
teria are bracketed together and joined by the word or, indicating that
you’re looking for contacts from either Florida or Oregon.
9. Optionally, use the parenthesis column if necessary.
The example in Figure 6-10 groups the two state criteria together with
parentheses so that these queries are carried out together. This is a 
particularly important step if your query contains both “and” and “or”
criteria.
10. Click Preview.
For those of you in need of instant gratification, you can see a list of all
the contacts that match your specification. And, if you goofed and no
contacts show up, you can quickly remove a few of your criteria by click-
ing the Remove button, and try again before anyone notices.
11. Choose File➪Save As if you’d like to use your query later.
The next time you want to run the same Advanced Query, you’ll be able
to return to the File menu, choose Open, and open your saved query.
12. When you finish selecting criteria, click OK.
13. At the Run Query Options message, select the Replace Lookup option
and click OK.
The results of the query display in the Contact List or Opportunities
List.
Although the process of saving and reusing an Advanced Query is relatively
easy, you can combine this process with the Menu Customization techniques
outlined in Chapter 3 to really save yourself oodles of time. Yes, Virginia, you
can most definitely add saved Queries to the Lookup menu so that you can
find all those Customers in Oregon and Florida who love red widgets!

 Using notes in ACT!
 Creating ACT! notes
 Understanding ACT! histories
 Reviewing your notes
L
ook around your desk. If you have more than one sticky note attached to
it, you need to use ACT!. Look at your computer monitor; if it’s decorated
with sticky notes, you need to use ACT!. Does a wall of sticky notes obscure
your file folders? Do you panic when you can’t find your pad of sticky notes?
Do you have small sticky notes clinging to larger sticky notes? You need to
use ACT!!
In this chapter, I show you how to make a note in ACT!. I also tell you all
about the notes or histories that ACT! creates for you automatically, and then
I give you a short course in reviewing your notes.
Getting to Know ACT! Notes
What if one of your best clients calls requesting a price quote? You jot down
some information on a piece of paper, only to have the paper disappear in the
mountain of clutter that you call your desk.
Or imagine that one of your more high-maintenance customers calls you on
March 1 in immediate need of an imported Italian widget. You check with
your distributors and guarantee him one by March 15. On March 10, he calls
you, totally irate that he hasn’t yet received his widget.
Sound familiar? The ACT! note is one of the easiest features to master but one
that too many users overlook. A simple note in ACT! provides you with sev-
eral benefits:

 Your entire office can operate on the same page by having access to the
same client data.
 You have a record, down to the date and time, of all communications
that you have with each of your contacts.
 You won’t forget what you said to your customer.
 You won’t forget what your customer said to you.
 You’ll be able to have pertinent information at your fingertips without
having to strip search your office looking for a lost sticky note.
Adding a note
Considering the importance of notes to the overall scheme of your business,
they are amazingly easy to add. Here’s all you have to do to add a note to a
contact record:
1. Make sure that you’re viewing the contact for which you’re creating a
note.
If you need help here, see Chapter 6 to help you look up the contact and
land in the Contact view.
2. On the Notes tab (middle of the screen), click the Insert Note icon.
The Insert Note window appears, date- and time-stamped with the cur-
rent date and time. Take a look at Figure 7-1.
3. Start typing your note in the Regarding area.
Your note can be as long or short as you want. You can use the format-
ting options exactly as you do in any word processor to emphasize any
portion of your note.
Figure 7-1:

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work

4. Click OK to record your note.
That was almost too easy for you; now you can move on to a few tricks that I
have up my sleeve.
Working with notes
After you create a note (see the preceding section), you might need to
change it. To edit a note, just double-click it to get back to the Insert Note
window. After you open it, here are a few things you can change:
 Change the note information. Start typing in the Regarding area exactly
as you do with any word processor.
 Change the date on a note. No matter how much you depend on your
computer, sometimes you still rely on good old-fashioned paper. Maybe
you jotted down a note after you turned off your computer for the day
or made notes — both mental and on paper — at a trade show. When
you start to input those notes into ACT!, they all have the current date
rather than the date when you actually created them. To change the
date on a note, simply click the date and choose a new date from the
drop-down menu that appears.
Not all notes are created equal; some of your notes might be more
important than others. As your list of notes becomes longer, various key
notes can get lost in the shuffle. A real low-tech solution is to postdate
the note by giving it a date several years into the future so that your
note always appears at the top of the Notes tab.
 Attach files to a contact record. In Chapter 5, I talk about adding files to
the Documents tab so that you can view and edit them right from the
Contact Detail window. In addition, you can attach a file to a note in a
contact record. To attach a file to a note, follow these steps:
a. Click the Insert Note icon on the Notes tab.
b. Click the Attach button in the Insert Note window.
c. Navigate to the file that you want to attach and then click Open.
d. Click OK to record the note.
To view the attached file, simply open the note and click the attached
file.
 Spell-check a note. If you’re like me, you type notes while doing a hun-
dred other things and end up with a lot of typos. Don’t fret; just run a
spell check by clicking the Spell Check icon in the Insert Note window.
ACT! opens the spell checker and locates any misspellings. Unfortunately,
you can check the spelling for only one note at a time.
101
Chapter 7: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

 Add Associate With info. If the note you’re adding is specific to a group
or company, a click of this button allows you to attach your note to that
group or company. Later, when viewing the group or company, you can
filter your notes to include just the ones that are associated with that
group or company. You might want to head over to Chapter 20 to glean
insight into Groups and Chapter 21 to comprehend Companies.
Discovering ACT! Histories
If you insist on doing things the hard way, feel free to skip this section. If you
love the thought of having someone else doing your work for you, read on!
Maybe you’ve noticed that the History tab is called, well, the History tab. In
the earlier sections of this chapter, I show you how to add and modify notes.
ACT!’s history entries are items that magically appear on the History tab 
after you
 Delete a contact (Chapter 4).
 Complete a scheduled meeting, call, or to-do item (Chapter 8).
 Write a letter, fax, or mail merge (Chapter 11).
 Change information in a field designated to create history (Chapter 13).
When you clear an activity, a history of the activity is recorded in the contact
record of the person with whom you scheduled the activity. You can also edit
or add activity details to the history, such as adding information about the
decisions made during the meeting. View these histories again later or create
reports based on activities with your contacts.
Creating field histories
ACT! provides you with a very powerful tool when you combine the use of
drop-down lists with the ability to create a history based on the changed
information in the field. By default, ACT! automatically creates a history when
you change the information in either the ID/Status or Last Results field. When
you enter information into either of these fields, it’s automatically saved on
the contact’s History tab.
Suppose that you create a ten-step sales process to coincide with the average
progression of one of your prospects into a customer. You can change the
Last Results field’s drop-down list to reflect those ten stages. As you progress
through the sales cycle and change the content of the Last Results field, ACT!
automatically creates a history indicating when the change took place. Figure
7-2 shows both the content of the Last Results field and the automatic histo-
ries that are created as the contact progresses through the sales stages.
102
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work

By relying on the field’s drop-down list to create new content information,
you ensure that your information remains consistent. You can then create
reports on the various sales stages by creating a lookup based on the notes
and histories.
In Chapter 6, I show you everything you need to know about creating 
lookups — and then some! Chapter 9 explains the various ACT! reports 
and shows you how to filter them by date range.
Clearing activity histories
In Chapter 8, I explain how to use ACT! to plan your busy schedule. After you
hold or attend a meeting, place a call, or complete something on your to-do
list, clearing the activity is important. Figure 7-3 shows you the Clear Activity
dialog box that opens each time you clear an activity. 
Select the Add Details to History check box, and ACT! automatically inserts
your notes as well as the history of the event on the History tab. ACT! pro-
vides you with the same option when you get in touch with a contact through
a letter, an e-mail, or a fax. Figure 7-4 shows the Create History dialog box
that appears after you create a letter in ACT!. Of course, you can always
choose not to include a history, but you’ll probably find recording one more
useful. You can even add more details in the Regarding area.
Figure 7-2:
Change the
sales step in
the Last
Results
field.
103
Chapter 7: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

Manually recording a history
Situations arise when recording a history of an event just isn’t practical. You
can create a history record for a contact without scheduling and clearing an
activity for that person. You can even add a history for someone who isn’t
yet in your database. For example, you might have called a potential new
client from your car and found juggling the steering wheel, your phone, and
your lunch while typing on your laptop a bit too daunting. However, when
you return to the office, you still need to record the calls that you made and
the tasks that you completed.
Figure 7-4:
Attach a
history to a
letter.
Figure 7-3:
Clear an

here.
104
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work

You can also record one history for an entire group of people. For example, you
might have attended a meeting at your local Chamber of Commerce and want
to record a few details about the meeting for each of the attendees. Regardless
of why you need to do it, here’s how you create a history after the fact:
1. Find the contact for whom you want to record a history.
If you’re creating a history for an entire group of people, create a lookup
of the contacts for whom you want to add a note.
2. Choose Contacts➪Record History.
The Record History window opens, as shown in Figure 7-5.
3. Select an activity type from the Type list.
If you need more activity types, don’t worry. Chapter 16 shows you how
to increase your selection of activity types.
4. Select a Result option.
5. Click the Contacts button if you’re creating a history for your current
lookup.
The Select Contacts window, as shown in Figure 7-6, opens.
This step isn’t necessary if you’re creating a history for just one contact
because that contact’s name would already appear in the Contact text
box of the Record History window. However, if you’re trying to record a
history for the multiple contacts that are included in the lookup that you
created in Step 1, you have to do a little extra footwork.
a. Choose Current Lookup from the Select From drop-down list.
b. Click the double right-pointing arrows to move all the contacts in your
current lookup to the Selected Contacts area.
c. Click OK to return to the Record History window.
Figure 7-5:
Record a
history here.
105
Chapter 7: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

6. Enter date, time, and duration information.
7. Enter activity information in the Regarding field or select a descrip-
tion from the drop-down list.
8. Add additional information in the Details area.
The information that you enter here is added to the Regarding field on
the History tab.
9. Click OK to record the history.
Your note is recorded in the contact’s record. If you created a history for
an entire group of contacts, the note appears in the contact record of
each individual in the group.
If you click the Follow-up button instead of OK, you can schedule a new,
follow-up activity in the same way that you scheduled your original
activity. Talk about one-stop shopping! The result of a call might be that
you scheduled a follow-up meeting for the next week. By scheduling a
follow-up activity, you have the results of your original meeting as well
as a reminder of the meeting scheduled in the future. You can also
schedule follow-up activities for the next step in your sales process.
Working with Your Notes and Histories
The Notes and History tabs are very similar; consequently, you can use them
in similar ways. They are so similar, in fact, that in previous versions of ACT!,
they were actually combined into one single tab. Here are a few things that
you can do to edit your notes and histories:
Figure 7-6:
Select the
contacts for
a manual
history.
106
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work

 Delete a note or history. To delete a note or history, you must first
select it and then press Delete. You can also right-click the selected note
and choose Delete Selected from the contextual menu. Either way, ACT!
presents you with a warning before you remove the note permanently.
 Delete several notes and/or histories. Eventually, you want to delete
certain notes or even histories. To delete several notes in one fell
swoop, just select the notes that you want to delete and then press
Delete:
• If you’re selecting several contiguous notes, click the first note and
then press Shift while clicking the last note that you want to delete.
• If the entries aren’t contiguous, press Ctrl while clicking each note
individually.
Now that you know how easy deleting a history is, you might want to
prevent other users of your database from deleting them. If you’re the
database administrator, choose Tools➪Preferences. Then, on the
General tab, remove the check mark next to the Allow History Editing
option.
 Copy a note. When you find duplicate contacts in your database, you
probably want to delete them — but not any notes attached to them. Or,
maybe you want a note from one contact record also attached to
another record. Luckily, ACT! gives you the ability to copy notes from
one contact to another contact with a simple copy-and-paste procedure:
a. Highlight the notes or histories that you want to copy and then press
Ctrl+C.
b. Find the contact where you want to insert the copied notes, then on
the Notes or History tab, press Ctrl+V.
If you’re feeling somewhat artistic, in need of a change, or just plain having
trouble with your forty-something eyesight, you might want to either add
gridlines around your notes or change the color and/or font style. Or, you
might just decide to walk on the wild side and change the whole ball of wax.
Take a stroll down preference lane to accomplish this:
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from any ACT! screen.
The Preferences dialog box opens.
2. Click the Colors and Fonts tab.
3. Click the Notes tab.
4. Click the Font button to select a different font, style, or size.
5. Click OK to close the Font window.
6. Choose a text color and background color from the Appearance area.
7. To have gridlines appear on the Notes tab, select the Show Grid Lines
check box.
107
Chapter 7: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

The ACT! gridlines are just like the gridlines you see in Excel. If you
change your preference to show gridlines, horizontal lines appear
between each of your notes and vertical lines between columns.
8. Repeat Steps 3–7 for the History tab.
9. Click OK.
Your Notes and History tabs are now modified according to the prefer-
ence settings that you selected.

Playing the Dating Game
In This Chapter
 Scheduling activities
 Viewing ACT! calendars
 Using the Task List
 Sharing your activities with others
 Creating an activity series
I
n this chapter, I show you how to schedule activities with your contacts,
how to view those activities and modify them if necessary, and even how
to find out whether you completed a scheduled activity. You also discover
the intricacies of navigating through the various ACT! calendars, how to use
your Task List to keep you on top of your activities, and the joy of sharing a
list of your scheduled activities with others.
Scheduling Your Activities
One of the most useful of ACT!’s features is its ability to tie an activity to a con-
tact. Most basic calendaring programs allow you to view your appointments
and tasks on your calendar, but they don’t offer a way of cross-referencing an
appointment to a contact. For example, if you schedule an appointment with
me and forget when that appointment is, you have to flip through your calen-
dar until you see my name. Plus, you can’t easily see a list of all appointments
that you’ve ever scheduled with me. However, ACT! offers these helpful 
features.
In ACT!, every activity is scheduled with a specific contact. If the contact
doesn’t exist in your database, you must add the person to your database —
or schedule the appointment with yourself.

Here’s what you do to add an activity to your busy schedule:
1. Go to the contact with whom you’re scheduling an activity.
Here’s the drill. You create a lookup (I show you how in Chapter 6) to
find a prospect’s phone number. You call the guy, and afterward, you
want to schedule a meeting. At this point, you’re already on the contact
record of the person with whom you’re scheduling an activity.
2. Schedule a call, meeting, or to-do in one of three ways:
• Click the Call, Meeting, or To-Do icon on the toolbar in the Contact
Detail window or the Contact List.
• Choose Call, Meeting, or To-Do from the Schedule menu in just
about any of the ACT! views.
• Double-click the appropriate time slot on any of the ACT! calendars.
Using different methods to schedule different activities is a smart plan of
action. For example, I recommend scheduling meetings through the cal-
endars to make sure that you don’t have a conflict for a specific time
slot. When you’re scheduling calls and to-dos, however, which are gener-
ally “timeless” activities that don’t have to be set for a specific time, you
can simply click the corresponding icon on the toolbar.
In any case, all roads lead to the Schedule Activity dialog box, as shown
in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1:
Schedule an

ACT! here.
110
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

3. On the General tab, fill in the various options.
If options is your name, ACT! is your game! The Schedule Activity dialog
box offers a myriad of scheduling options from which to pick, and ACT!
has thoughtfully filled in many of these options based on your default
scheduling preferences. (Chapter 3 walks you through changing some of
these preferences.) You can leave the information in the following fields
as is or override the default preferences:
• Activity Type: Choose Call, Meeting, To-Do, Personal Activity, or
Vacation from the drop-down list.
• Start Date: Click the arrow to the right of the field to display the cal-
endar and select the date of the big event.
• Start Time: Enter a start time for the event. Choose Timeless for the
Start Time if you’re scheduling a call or to-do that doesn’t need to
occur at a specific time.
• Duration: Click the arrow to the right of the field to choose the
duration for the activity. You can also manually specify a time
range; an hour-and-a-half-long meeting can be entered as either 
90 m or 1.5 h.
The End Date and End Time are automatically set based on the
starting date and time you specify. If you change the duration, ACT!
automatically adjusts the end date and time.
• Use Banner: This option lets you display a banner on the monthly
calendar if an activity involves one or more full days.
• Schedule With: The name of the current contact automatically
appears here. Select a different contact by typing the first few let-
ters of a contact’s last name to locate the contact in the list.
If you click the Schedule With drop-down list, you’ll notice that the
names appear alphabetically by last name. If you’re having trouble
remembering someone’s last name, simply click the Company
column heading to arrange those contacts alphabetically by com-
pany. You can then type the first few letters of a company name in
the Schedule With box.
• Contacts: Click the Contacts button and then choose Select
Contacts to select more than one contact, New Contact to add a
new contact, or My Record to schedule a personal appointment.
• Regarding: You’ll want to give a brief description of the activity
because it is later reflected on the contact’s History tab. Type it
here or choose an item from the drop-down list.
111
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

The Regarding drop-down list reflects the Activity Type that you
choose, so scheduling a Call gives you different options from
scheduling a Meeting. Don’t like the items in the drop-down? As
usual, you’ll find the Edit List Values options button. Click it to
create your very own customized drop-down list for each one of
the activity types.
• Resources: If you’re using ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups, you
can place first dibs on shared commodities such as the conference
room, LCD projector, or the office stash of candy bars.
• Location: It never hurts to let everyone know, including yourself,
where the big event is going to take place.
• Priority: Choose High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low, or Low.
Don’t see the Medium-High and Medium-Low options? Chapter 16
shows you how to customize your Priorities list.
• Color: Click the arrow to the right of the field to display a color
palette, and then choose the color that you want to assign to the
activity. Feel free to design your own system of color-coding your
calendar.
• Ring Alarm: Enabling this sets an alarm to remind you of a sched-
uled activity at a specified interval before the event. 
• Schedule For/By: Click this button to assign a task to one of your co-
workers (as if ACT! hasn’t made life easy enough for you already!).
4. (Optional) Click the Options button.
If you wish, click the Options button select one of these options:
• Confirm the activity with the contact(s) involved by sending an
e-mail to the participant(s). ACT! automatically opens up an email
message filled in with the critical detail in the body of the e-mail
like the one shown in Figure 8-2 and includes an attachment in
ACT! format. When the e-mail recipient receives the e-mail, he can
double-click the attachment (the instructions for this are also
included in the body of the e-mail) and have the activity automati-
cally placed in his ACT! calendar.
• Create a separate activity for each participant if you’re schedul-
ing your activity with more than one contact.
5. On the Details tab, add additional details and print the details (if you
want).
These are two relatively important tasks:
• Details: Add additional information regarding an activity. For exam-
ple, you might want to add special instructions about the items
that you need to bring to a meeting.
• Print: This is where you can print the activity details.
112
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

6. On the Recurrence tab, designate the activity as recurring if that’s the
case; otherwise, go to Step 7.
If the activity that you’re scheduling repeats on a regular basis, you can
designate it as a recurring activity rather than setting up several sepa-
rate activities. For example, if you’re taking a class that meets once a
week for the next 12 weeks, you can designate the class as a meeting
with a weekly recurrence. Be sure to specify the date on which the activ-
ity stops recurring.
Here are the recurring option settings:
• Daily: Select to schedule an activity that occurs daily and the date
on which the activity stops.
• Weekly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs weekly, on which
day or days of the week the activity is scheduled, and the date on
which the activity stops.
• Monthly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs monthly by indi-
cating the week in the month, the day of the week, or the specific
day of the month on which the activity will be occurring and the
date on which the activity stops.
• Yearly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs every year, and
the date on which the activity stops.
The Annual Event field can eliminate the need to set reminders for
activities, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and renewal dates.
Find out how to set up an Annual Event field in Chapter 13.

7. Click OK.
You now have a real, live scheduled activity!
After you create activities, ACT! is a worse nag than your mother! You can 
see your activities — and ACT! reminds you to complete them — in a number
of ways:
 Alarm: If you asked ACT! to ring the alarm when scheduling an activity,
the ACT! Alarms window appears at the specified time before the activ-
ity is due. It also appears each time that you open ACT!.
 Per contact: The Activities tab for a selected contact enables you to see
what specific activities you scheduled with that particular contact.
 All contacts: The Task List shows a listing of everything you scheduled
for all your contacts during a specified time period.
 Calendar: All ACT! calendars including the monthly, weekly, and daily
views show a listing of the current day’s activities.  
Later in this chapter, in the section “Exploring Activities,” I show you how to
view, edit, clear, and share your scheduled activities.
Regardless of your method of viewing your activities, remember this tip:
When frustrated, check your filters. If you’re just not seeing everything that you
know is supposed to be showing in your calendar, check your filters! Not
seeing anything scheduled for the future? Maybe your date range is set to
show the activities for today only. Seeing too much? Perhaps your filters are
set to show everyone’s Task List or calendar. Not seeing any of your activities
at all? Perhaps your filters are set to include everything except your own
activities! Flip back to Chapter 5 if you want a refresher course in those frus-
trating filters!
Working with the ACT! Calendar
The various ACT! calendars are great for viewing scheduled tasks. Here are a
couple of ways to get to your calendars:
 Choose View and specify the type of calendar that you want to view.
 Click the calendar icon on the Nav bar.
114
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

You can view your calendar in any one of four different ways, depending on
which way you feel the most comfortable:
 Daily calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected
day as well as a listing of the day’s tasks (see Figure 8-3). The day is
divided into half-hour intervals.
Not happy with half-hour intervals? No problem; you can change that
default setting in ACT!’s preference settings. Not sure how to do that?
Take a peek at Chapter 3 to tweak your preferences.
 Work Week calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the
selected week as well as a listing of the day’s tasks. Each day is repre-
sented by a single column and divided into half-hour intervals.
 Weekly calendar: Shows the entire week including Saturday and Sunday.
(See Figure 8-4.)
 Monthly calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected
month as well as a listing of the day’s tasks (see Figure 8-5).

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

The mini-calendar
A mini-calendar appears to the right of any of the ACT! calendars. The mini-
calendars work a little differently from the daily, weekly, and monthly calendars
in that they are used to change a date and not to just schedule an appointment.
If you’d like, you can access a three months’ supply of mini-calendars by press-
ing F4 from any of the ACT! views (see Figure 8-6). Right-click the day that you
want to check, and a small window appears, displaying all activities scheduled
for that day.
After you access any of the ACT! calendars, you can navigate to a different
date in one of the following ways:
 View today’s activities by pressing Ctrl+Home.
 Switch to a different day by clicking any day on the mini-calendar.
 Get a daily synopsis by right-clicking any day on the mini-calendar.
 Go to a different year by clicking the double arrows.
 Go to a different month by clicking the single arrows.
The Recap List
If you take a peek at any of the calendars, you notice a mini-calendar up at
the top-right corner. As I mention earlier, this calendar provides you with a
quick way to view a different calendar date by clicking it. A miniature to-do
list — the Recap List — appears right below the calendar. The Recap List lists
all your scheduled activities on a specific day.
You can view the Recap List of only one user at a time, but you can have
access to multiple users’ Recap Lists. When you select multiple users, but-
tons with each user’s name appear in the Recap List. Click the user’s name to
open or close his Recap List. If a selected user has no scheduled activities for
the selected date, her name doesn’t display in the Recap List. To view
another user’s Recap List, follow these steps:
1. Click the Calendars icon on the Nav bar.
2. Click the Select Users button.
Figure 8-6:
The mini-
calendar.
117
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

The Select Users dialog box appears.
3. Select the users whose Recap Lists you want to view and then click OK.
When you select multiple users, their tasks all appear on both the calen-
dar and the Recap List. This can get confusing — not to mention make you
feel that you have too much to do if you forget you’re viewing everyone
else’s activities. This is where a bit of color-coding can come into play.
Gary’s activities might all be in blue, and Alyssa’s might be in magenta.
That way, you’ll be sure to know which activities belong to whom. 
4. From the calendar, select the date for the Recap List you want to view.
The user’s tasks display in the Recap List (see Figure 8-7). If you selected
multiple users, you can click the button with the user’s name to view
that user’s tasks.
Using the Task List
Like the Honey-Do list hanging from your husband’s workbench, the ACT!
Task List gives you a listing of all the activities for all your contacts.
The Task List is readily accessible by clicking the Task List icon on ACT!’s
Nav bar. Figure 8-8 shows a sample Task List.
Figure 8-7:
The Recap
List.
118
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

You can filter the Task List by using different criteria (as shown in Figure 8-8):
 The date range of the activities
 The type of activity
 The priority of the activity
 The users whose activities you want to view
You can also include a few more advanced activity options by clicking the
Options button:
 Private
 Timeless
 Cleared
 Outlook
Creating a lookup from the Task List
Here’s the scenario. You wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face
another new day. You get to the office, view your Task List, and stop dead in
your tracks: The length of your Task List is so long that you don’t even know
Figure 8-8:
The ACT!
Task List.
119
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

where to begin. Consider creating a lookup directly from the Task List. By
spending the first hour of your day sending out all those faxes and brochures
that you promised — and then the next hour returning your phone calls —
you get everything done.
When you break down your tasks into manageable pieces — instead of
having a breakdown yourself — the Task List becomes less intimidating.
Having said all that, I feel compelled to add that Rome wasn’t built in a day,
and you might not be able to complete all your tasks in a single day, either.
ACT! has a preference that enables you to roll over your tasks to the next 
day if necessary. Check out Chapter 3 for a quick refresher on changing ACT!
preferences.
1. To open your Task List, click the Task List icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
2. Select the date range of the activities for which you want to create a
lookup.
3. Select the activity types in the Types area to indicate the activities
that you want to work with.
As you select these options, hopefully, your Task List became a bit
shorter. If you feel so inclined, you can filter your Task List even further
by selecting the priority types you’d like to include and making sure that
your tasks are the only ones visible in the Task List.
4. Right-click the Task List and select Create Lookup.
ACT! creates a lookup of the selected activities. You can now scroll
through your contacts and work on all similar tasks at the same time.
Printing the Task List
As great as ACT! is, it can be totally useless if you don’t have access to a com-
puter or hand-held device. Or maybe you work with a technically challenged
co-worker (your boss?) who prefers to have a copy of his or her Task List
printed on a daily basis. No need to fret; ACT! can easily perform this task 
for you:
1. Click the Task List icon on the Nav bar.
2. Choose File➪Quick Print Current Window.
The Quick Report dialog box opens.
3. Click OK to print the Task List.
120
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Exploring Activities
In the first section of this chapter, “Scheduling Your Activities,” I show you
how to do exactly that. After scheduling an activity, you’ll probably want to
take a look at it. Or edit it. Or clear it. Or maybe even share it with others. So
in this section, I show you how to do all these things.
Viewing the Activities tab
If you click the Activities tab at the bottom of the Contact Detail window,
ACT! displays all the activities scheduled with the current contact. This is 
a great way to have a list of all the activities that you’ve scheduled with a
contact.
You can see the Activities tab in Figure 8-9. You can filter your activities so
that only certain activities show on the Activities tab. Your choices include
 Dates to show
 Types to show
 Priorities to show
 Users
 Private activities
 Timeless activities
 Cleared activities
 Outlook activities
Can’t find the filter options for Private, Timeless, Cleared, and Outlook activi-
ties? Click the Options button, and you’ll find them.
Figure 8-9:
The
Activities
tab.
121
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

After you set your filters, you can also determine the columns that you want
to appear on the Activities tab. These are the possibilities:
 The type, date, time, and duration of the activity
 The priority that you set for the activity
 The regarding information and any details that you entered for the 
activity
 The company and contact name
 The name of the group or company that the activity might be associated
with
 The contact’s phone number, extension, and e-mail address
 Additional activity details
 What ACT! user the activity was scheduled for and the ACT! user who
scheduled the activity
 Any attachments associated with the big event
After you determine the columns that you want to view onscreen, you can
easily print a down-and-dirty report. In Chapter 5, I give you all the juicy
details for rearranging the columns on the Activities tab — or on any other
ACT! list for that matter — and turning it into a Quick Print report.
Editing your activities
Like all the best-laid plans of mice and men, your activities will change, and
you need a way to make note of these changes in ACT!. Changing an activity
is all in the click — or in this case, the double-click — of the mouse. If you can
see an activity, you can edit it. That means you can edit your activities from
the Activities tab, the Task List, or from any of the ACT! calendars. The only
activities that you can’t change are those that you’ve already cleared.
Resist the urge to simply change the date for rescheduled activities. Although
this is easy enough to do, you might end up losing some key information. Say,
for instance, that a particularly high-maintenance customer stands you up
four times — and then complains to your boss about your lack of service. If
you had simply edited the original activity, you wouldn’t be able to document
the dates of all four activities. You might like to think of this as CYA (um,
cover your ACT!) technology!
122
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Clearing activities
After you complete a task, clearing the task is very important because 
then ACT!
 Stops reminding you about the activity
 Allows you to add some additional details about the activity
 Lets you schedule a follow-up activity if necessary
 Automatically updates the Last Reach, Last Meeting, or Last Attempt
fields with the current date
 Creates an entry on the History tab of the contact with whom you had
scheduled the activity
Clearing an alarm is not the same as clearing an activity. You might clear an
alarm when you first open ACT! or when the activity is scheduled to occur, and
not actually clear the activity. Eventually, your Task List will grow dangerously
long, in which case, you’re probably going to start ignoring it all together.
Worse, you won’t have a history of the activity because theoretically it never
occurred!
To clear an activity, follow these steps:
1. Select the activity that you want to clear by doing one of the 
following:
• In any Calendar view, select the check box next to the activity in
the Recap List.
• In the Task List or on the Activities tab, click the check mark
column.
• Right-click the activity and choose Clear Activity.
Using any method, the Clear Activity dialog box appears (see Figure 8-10).
The current date and time appear automatically. The Regarding informa-
tion that you had originally entered for the activity appears as well. This
information later appears in the Regarding column of the history that is
automatically created when you clear an activity.
The Clear Activity dialog box enables you to clear just one activity at a
time. You can clear multiple activities from the Activities tab or the Task
List:
a. Hold down the Ctrl key while selecting additional activities to clear.
b. Right-click the selected activities and then choose Clear Multiple
Activities from the shortcut menu.
123
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

2. Select a Result option.
The result determines the type of note that’s added to the History tab as
well as the system field that is affected. For example, if you indicate that
a call was completed, two things happen:
• A history is added to the History tab with Call Completed showing
in the Type column.
• The Last Reach field is changed to include today’s date.
The results vary according to the type of activity that you scheduled. If
you schedule a meeting, the results are either Meeting Held or Meeting
Not Held. If you schedule a call, you see different result options includ-
ing Call Attempted, Call Completed, and Call Left Message.
3. Select the Add Details to History check box if you want to edit or add
activity details.
Changes that you make to the Add Details area appear in the Regarding
field on the History tab for the contact.
4. Click the Follow Up Activity button to schedule a follow-up activity (if
you want).
This is a very cool concept. When you clear an activity, ACT! gives you
the option of scheduling a follow-up activity. Schedule a follow-up
exactly like you schedule an original activity.
5. Schedule the follow-up activity in the Schedule Activity dialog box
and then click OK to return to the Clear Activity dialog box.
6. Click OK again, and you’re done.

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Creating an Activity Series
Quite simply, an activity series is a series of steps that you might want to
follow to achieve a specific goal. For example, you might have a six-step plan
of action for every prospect that heads your way, or seven things you need to
do during each of your customer-related projects. Every time you meet a new
prospect, you might want to lure him into using your services with a specific
plan of action: send a brochure, follow it up with a phone call, send out a
letter explaining some of the things you discussed in the phone call, and then
finally send an e-mail further explaining your business. After the prospect
becomes a customer, you might want to routinely send a welcoming letter,
send out a proposal, wait for approval, and then wait for the deposit check to
slide into your mailbox.
ACT! allows you to group these steps into one list in order for you to auto-
mate your process. By using an activity series, you can stick to your game
plan. And, hopefully, some of those hot prospects turn into customers
because you don’t allow any of them to fall through the cracks. 
Using the Activity Series Template
Creation Wizard
Before you can schedule an activity series, you must create one using the
Activity Series Template Creation Wizard. Here’s where you develop the
series by naming it, setting it as public or private, and adding activities. The
wizard also allows you to edit or delete an existing activity series template.
Follow these steps to start the wizard:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Series Templates from any ACT!
screen.
2. In the Activity Series Template Creation Wizard, select the Create a
New Activity Series radio button and then click Next.
The wizard walks you through the next three steps.
3. Fill in the name of your new activity series, indicate whether it’s
public or private, give it a description (if necessary), and then click
Next.
The Activity Series Template Creation Wizard opens, as shown in 
Figure 8-11.
125
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

4. Click the Add button to add all the steps you want to include in your
activity series.
The Add Activity dialog box opens; you can take a peek at it in Figure
8-12.
5. Fill in the Add Activity dialog box and click OK.
Here’s where you indicate all the pertinent details for each and every
step of your activity series. You have to enter several key pieces of infor-
mation; don’t worry if you make a mistake because you can always go
back and edit these steps if you don’t get them right the first time.
• Activity Type: Indicate whether you’re scheduling a call, meeting,
to-do, or a custom activity (skip ahead to Chapter 16 for more info
about custom activities).
Figure 8-12:

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

• Starts: Activity series are based on an anchor date. You can either
schedule an activity that occurs after the anchor date (which is
generally the day you begin the series) or activities that must be
completed before the anchor date.
• Regarding, Priority, Color, and Ring Alarm: These fields are the exact
same ones you encounter when scheduling a regular, run-of-the-
mill activity.
• If Activity Falls on a Non-Working Day, Schedule on the Following
Work Day: Select this check box to prevent an activity from being
scheduled on a Saturday or Sunday.
• Schedule For: If you’re like me, you like nothing better than delegat-
ing work to another person. Here’s where you can assign each
Activity Series step to a poor, unsuspecting co-worker!
6. Repeat Step 5 as often as you need and then click Next.
7. Indicate Yes if you want to schedule the series now or No if you want
to start it later and click Finish.
Scheduling an activity series
After you create the template, you can schedule the series with one of your
contacts and set the anchor date. All the activities link together so that if one
activity changes to another date, you have the option to change only that
activity to another date or to reschedule all the remaining activities.
1. Create a lookup to find the contact or contacts with whom you want to
schedule the activity series.
I warn you repeatedly that ACT! saves you lots and lots of time. If sched-
uling an activity series with one person saves you time, just think of
what scheduling one with a bunch of people does for you!
2. Choose Schedule➪Activity Series.
The Schedule Activity Series dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-13.
3. Select the activity series template that you want to use, indicate the
anchor date, and click OK.
If you forgot to create a lookup or if you want to include a few more con-
tacts, you can do it. Select one contact from the With drop-down menu,
or select multiple contacts from the Contacts dialog box by clicking the
Contacts button and selecting Select Contacts.
The activities are scheduled and appear on the appropriate spots on the
contact’s Activities tab, the Task List, and on the calendars. No time is
yet associated with any of the activities because activities scheduled as
an activity series are automatically timeless.
127
Chapter 8: Playing the Dating Game

No conflict checking is performed when the activities are scheduled using an
activity series. Your tasks are scheduled regardless of whether you are
already scheduled to be on vacation or off attending a conference in
Kalamazoo.
Before scheduling the series with a large number of contacts, test the series
by scheduling it with just one contact. Then, take a gander at that contact’s
Activities tab to make sure that the activities appear in a logical sequence. If
something appears amiss, delete all the scheduled activities from the con-
tact’s Activities tab and read on.
Modifying an activity series
Mistakes happen — and you might make one when initially setting up your
activity series. Or you might wish to assign another employee to one of the
steps in the series. Not to worry; here’s all you need to do to modify the series:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Series Templates.
2. Select the Edit an Existing Activity Series radio button in the first
screen of the Activity Series Template Creation Wizard and then 
click Next.
3. Select the activity step that you wish to edit and click the Edit button.
4. Make the appropriate changes in the Add Activity dialog box and
click OK.
5. Click OK in the Schedule Activity Series window when you finish mod-
ifying all the activities.

In this part . . .
E
ntering contacts into ACT! is only half the fun. The
other half consists of communicating with the outside
world. In this part, you find out how to run and create
reports for your internal purposes and also how to reach
an audience of one or thousands through the use of snail
mail or e-mail. You’ll even find a large collection of com-
mercial forms for printing (buried deep inside ACT!).

A
fter you build your database, the fun part is sitting back and using it. If
paper is your game, then ACT! is surely the name — at least of the soft-
ware that you should be using for any type of reporting. Here in this chapter,
I discuss the various ACT! reports that are available. In Chapter 10, I demon-
strate how to design your very own reports.
In this chapter, I show you everything you always wanted to know about ACT!
reports but were afraid to ask. After reading this chapter, you’ll be familiar
with the various reports, know how to run them, and also know techniques
for sharing those reports with colleagues. You also find out about some of the
“non-reports” such as labels, address books and list views that are buried
away in some unexpected places.
Knowing the Basic ACT! Reports
ACT! comes with a menu of 40 basic reports right out of the box. In Chapter
10, I show you how to customize existing reports or create new ones. Here I
list the basic reports, briefly describing each. Chances are good that at least
one of the basic ACT! reports gives you exactly the information that you’re
looking for.
If you really want to see firsthand what each ACT! report looks like, open the
Act8Demo database and print out the first page of each report. Then, stick all
the reports in a notebook. (If you want to get really fancy, stick them in sheet
protectors first.) That way, if you ever need to run a report, you can go back
to your sample printouts for a quick reference before you start running a lot
of unnecessary reports.

The first three reports in the ACT! Reports menu are probably among the
most useful because they supply you with information for each of your con-
tacts. You can determine which one best suits your needs by deciding
whether you want to view a page, a paragraph, or simply one line of informa-
tion about your contact.
 Contact Report: A one-page report showing all the contact information
for each contact, including the notes, history, and activities.
 Contact Directory: Prints the primary address and home address for
each contact in paragraph form.
 Phone List: Prints the company name, company phone number, phone
extension, and mobile phone number for each contact; the report dis-
plays one line of content for each contact.
The next several reports display information that’s pertinent to you and your
notes and activities:
 Activities: Shows you the scheduled and completed calls, meetings, and
to-do’s scheduled with each contact during a specified date range. The
Task List is sorted by contact so that you can see a listing of all the time
that you’ve spent — or are scheduled to spend — with any given contact.
 Notes/History: Lists the notes and history items for each contact during
a specified date range.
 History Summary: Produces a tally of the number of attempted calls,
completed calls, meetings held, letters sent, and fields changed for each
contact during a specified date range sorted by contact. Figure 9-1
shows you the top part of a History Summary report.
 History Summary Classic: Shows the numerical total of attempted calls,
completed calls, meetings held, and letters sent for each contact during
a specified date range sorted by contact.
The History Summary report displays only those contacts that you’ve
contacted during a specific date range. Comparatively, the History
Summary Classic report displays a list of all your contacts, including
contacts that you’ve contacted as well as those that you have not. If you
end up producing a 50-page report, I suggest creating a Contact Activity
lookup before running the report. If you need help creating a lookup,
turn to Chapter 6.
 History Time Spent: Shows the date, time, duration, and information
regarding activities scheduled with each contact during a specified date
range. You get a subtotal of the time that you spend with each contact as
well as of the time that you’re still scheduled to spend with them — if
you assign a time duration to your meetings, calls, and to-do’s.
132
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

The next two reports are based on information in two of the key ACT! fields:
 Contact Status: Shows you the ID/Status, last reach, last meeting, and
last results for each contact during a specified date range. You’ll likely
want to create a Contact Activity lookup before running this report to
avoid having a lot of empty contact information in your final report.
 Source of Referrals: The Source of Referrals report relies on the infor-
mation in the Referred By field. Figure 9-2 shows you an example of the
Source of Referrals report and plainly shows what happens if you don’t
enter data consistently. Dave Davis and David Davis are probably the
same person, yet they show up in two different spots in the report.
You can find the Group reports together in a subsection of the main Reports
menu. These reports give you different ways to view the information in your
groups. If you aren’t using groups (which I explain fully in Chapter 20), these
reports might not be of any benefit to you.
 Group Membership: Lists all groups and their members
 Group Summary: Lists the notes, histories, and activities for all groups
or for specific groups
Figure 9-1:
The ACT!

133
Chapter 9: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

 Group Comprehensive: Lists all information (including notes, histories,
and activities) for each group, subgroup, and their respective members
 Group List: Lists all groups and their description from the Group
Description field
You find the Company reports together in a subsection of the main Reports
menu. These reports give you different ways to view the information in your
companies. If I sound like a broken record, it’s because the five Group reports
that I mention earlier all come in a “company version.”
ACT! provides you with a variety of Opportunity reports, funnels, and graphs.
The Opportunity reports use information entered onto the Opportunities tab.
If you aren’t using the Opportunities feature (head to Chapter 19 for the low-
down), you can’t use these reports. The Opportunity reports are all housed
in a separate Opportunity section in the Reports menu.
 Sales Analysis by Record Manager: Shows the total sales by Record
Manager, including everything from the average dollar amount of his
sales to the average number of days it takes to close a sale
 Totals by Status: Garners totals of all sales opportunities and sorts them
by Closed/Won Sales and Lost Sales

 Adjusted for Probability: Lists all sales opportunities showing a
weighted sales total
 Pipeline Report: Gives information about sales opportunities at each
stage in the sales process
 Opportunities by Record Manager: Lists sales opportunities,
Closed/Won Sales, and Lost Sales sorted by Record Manager
 Opportunities by Contact: Provides complete sales information for each
contact with a sales opportunity or a closed sale
 Opportunities Graph: Gives forecasted or closed sales, in a bar or line
graph
 Opportunities Pipeline: Gives the number of sales opportunities at each
stage of the sales process, in a graphical form
More than a dozen more ACT! reports are, unfortunately, buried. The Report
menus include several “other report” options, which would lead you to believe
that they would lead you to, well, some of the “other” reports. Not so. If you
click any of the “other reports” menu options, you land in a folder that contains
all the ACT! reports. If you look carefully, you’ll find the following reports:
 Birthday List: Shows contact name, company name, and birth date for
each contact
 E-mail List: Lists contact names and their primary e-mail addresses
 Task List: Gives the 411 about the activities scheduled with each contact
and the status of each activity
 Fax List: Lists contact names and their fax numbers
 Lost Opportunities by Competitor: Shows subtotals of lost opportuni-
ties by competitor
 Lost Opportunities by Reason: Shows subtotals of lost opportunities by
reason
 Lost Opportunities by Record Manager: Shows subtotals of lost oppor-
tunities by Record Manager
 Opportunities by Company: Show information for each company and
any open opportunities
 Opportunities by Group Summary: Shows information for each group
and any open opportunities
 Opportunities Referred By: Shows opportunities subtotaled by who
referred the opportunity
 Gross Margin by Contact: Shows the gross margin by contact
 Gross Margin by Product: Lists each product and gross margin for each
product

Running an ACT! Report
The following steps apply to all ACT! reports. The dialog box is the same for
all reports. Depending on the report that you’re running, however, some of
the options might be unavailable — and thus, appear grayed out.
To run an ACT! report, just follow these steps:
1. Perform a lookup or display the contact record or records that you
want to include in the report.
All roads in ACT! lead — or at least pass by — the lookup. Before running
a report, decide which contact’s or group’s data you want to include in
your report. For example, you might run a History Summary report for a
single contact or a Contact report for all contacts in a state or region. You
can include data from the current contact or group record, the current
contact or group lookup, or from all contacts or groups.
2. Choose the Reports menu and then select the name of the report that
you want to run. To run a report that doesn’t appear in the menu,
choose Reports➪Other Contact Reports and select the appropriate

The Define Filters dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-3. The General
tab is identical for any and all ACT! reports that you create. 
All reports come equipped with a General tab. However, all reports are
not created equally when it comes to the other tabs. Depending on the
report you run, you’ll notice different tabs available to you. 
3. In the Send the Report Output To drop-down list, select an output for
the report:
• Preview: Choose the Preview option if you’re at all hesitant about
your reporting capabilities. A preview of the report appears
onscreen. After previewing the report, print it or run it again if it
doesn’t look exactly how you want.
• Rich-Text File: Saves the report as an RTF file, which you can open
in Word.
• HTML File: Saves the report as an HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) file. Choose this option if you want to use the report on
your Web site.

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

• PDF File: Saves the report as a PDF file that can be read in Adobe
Reader.
• Text File: Saves the report as a TXT file, which you can read with a
wide variety of software, including Excel.
• Printer: Sends the report directly to your default printer. If you’re
fully confident that your report will print correctly the first time,
go for it!
• E-mail: Sends the saved report as an attachment to an e-mail mes-
sage. The attachment has an .rpt extension and can be read only
by recipients who have ACT! installed on their computers.
4. In the Create Report For area, specify the contacts to include in the
report.
The choices are self explanatory. You run a report for the current con-
tact, the current lookup, or all contacts.
5. Select the Exclude ‘My Record’ check box if you don’t want to include
information from your My Record in the report.
This option is not available for all reports.
6. In the Use Data Managed By area, select the Record Manager of the
contacts that you’re including in your report.
• All Users: Includes contact records managed by all users of the
database.
• Selected Users: Includes contact records managed by selected
users of the database. If you’re the only user of the database, only
your name appears in the list.

7. Click the Activities, Note, and/or History tabs, if you’re running any of
those reports, and make the appropriate selections.
• On the Activities tab, select the type of activities and the corre-
sponding date range of the activities to include in your report.
• On the History tab, select the type of histories and the correspond-
ing date range that you’re including in your report.
• In the Use Data Managed By area, select the users who imputed the
data that you want to include in the report.
By default, any of the activity, notes, or history reports show you data
for the current month. If you don’t change those date ranges, your
report might not give you the information that you’re expecting to see.
8. Click the Opportunity tab, if you see one, when running a Sales
report.
Seems a bit hokey, but sometimes the Opportunity options appear on
the General tab, and sometimes they appear on their very own tab as
illustrated in Figure 9-4.
Regardless of where you find the Opportunity options, you still have the
same choices:
• In the Opportunities area, select whether you want to include Open,
Closed - Won, Closed – Lost, and/or Inactive sales in your report.
• In the Date Range drop-down menu, specify the date range of the
Sales Opportunities to include in the report.
• In the Use Data Managed By area, choose to include the opportu-
nity information from All Users or Selected Users of your database.

ACT! runs the report. If you aren’t happy with the results, run the same
report a second time by using different criteria or try running a different
report. Better yet, read Chapter 10 to discover how to create your very
own ACT! reports.
Printing Address Books
Printing an address book is probably one of the more common tasks used by
ACT! users, and ACT! makes the chore an extremely simple one to perform.
Creating a hard copy of your ACT! address book is basically a three-step
process:
1. Add all your contact information into your ACT! database, making sure
that your information is as complete as possible.
2. Create a lookup of the contacts that you want to include in your address
book.
Of course, you might want to include all your contacts in the print copy
of your address book. You might even want to print separate address
books for each of the different types of contacts in your database.
3. Choose the format for your address book. ACT! comes equipped with
some neat choices including Day-Timer and Franklin address books.
Those are the basic steps. The following steps include all the down-and-dirty
details for creating your own printed address book:
1. Create a lookup if you intend to print only a portion of your address
book that I show you how to create at the beginning of this section.
Refer to Chapter 6 if you need a refresher course in creating an ACT!
lookup.
2. From any of the ACT! windows, choose File➪Print.
Okay, I know you’re probably scratching your head wondering why I’m
asking you to print when you haven’t created anything yet. That’s the
concept with these non-reports: They aren’t actually reports by defini-
tion, so ACT! just threw them into the Print menu. Go figure!
The Print dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-5.
3. Choose Address Book from the Printout Type area.
4. Select the paper type for printing the address book.
139
Chapter 9: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

ACT! enables you to print contact addresses and phone numbers in a
variety of commonly used paper formats, including
• At-A-Glance
• Day Runner
• Day-Timer
• Franklin
You can print all your ACT! information onto preformatted addressing
systems. ACT! provides you with the most popular, commercially avail-
able addressing systems. The preprinted forms are available at any of
the large office supply warehouse stores. If you use an address system
from one of these manufacturers, choose it from the Paper Type list.
Figure 9-5 shows you some of your choices. The Edit Template button 
is grayed out because you can’t make changes to the Address Book 
templates.
Of course, if you don’t want to spend the money on preprinted forms or
you just want a printout of your address book on a plain sheet of paper,
you can always use my particular favorite form for printing an address
book: plain paper.
A preview of the selected printout appears in the Preview pane on the
right if you have the Enable Preview option checked.
5. Click the Options button to specify the information to include in the
address book.
The Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-6.

6. In the Print area, select the fields to include in your address book:
• Primary Address: Prints the contact’s main address
• Alternate Address: Prints the contact’s alternate address
• Phone Numbers: Prints the contact’s phone numbers, including
Work, Alternate, Fax, Mobile Phone, Home Phone, and Pager
• Secondary Contacts: Prints the secondary contacts’ names and
phone numbers
• E-mail Address: Prints the contact’s e-mail addresses
7. In the Additional Fields drop-down menus, you can add up to three
additional fields.
The choices in Step 6 are based on the default fields that come with
ACT!. If you’ve added several new phone number fields, they don’t
appear in the printout of your address book, but ACT! allows you to add
up to three additional fields.
8. In the Print Settings area, select your printing options.
Here’s where you get to determine how your address book is going to
print:
• Break Page on New Letter: Starts a new page for each letter of the
alphabet
• Letter at the Top of Each Page: Prints the current alphabetic letter
at the top of each page
• European Postal Format: Prints the postal code before the city

the Current Contact, the Current Lookup, or All Contacts.

Creating Mailing Labels and Envelopes
All right. You’ve created a brochure that’s guaranteed to knock the socks
right off of your customers — and potential customers. Now all you have 
to do is send out those puppies in the mail. There is no easier method to 
do this than by creating mailing labels or envelopes using ACT!.
Some of you might be snickering about now because you’re much too sophis-
ticated to be using snail mail. You’ve probably already raced over to Chapter
12 to find out how to create e-mail blasts. But you might still want to use the
ACT! labels to create everything from file tabs to name badges.
You print out labels and envelopes in ACT! in exactly the same way. At first
glance, printing envelopes in ACT! to match a customized letter template
seems like a great idea. After all, they look a lot more personalized than an
ordinary mailing label. However, if your mailing entails sending personalized
letters to a large number of people, consider rethinking your decision. Unless
you have a specially designed envelope tray, you’re probably going to have to
print your envelopes in batches. And remember that 30 envelopes are much
bulkier and harder to store than a page of 30 labels. While you print each
batch of envelopes, you have to make sure that they remain in the exact
same order as your letters, or matching them to the corresponding letter
could become a nightmare.
If you’re printing envelopes, I suggest limiting the number of envelopes that
you print at any one time. If you’re just printing a single envelope for one
person to go with a letter that you just created using a document template,
using your word processor to create the envelope is probably easier than
using ACT!. ACT! automatically asks whether you want to print an envelope
after you create a letter when using a document template. (See Chapter 11 for
the details.)
To create labels or envelopes using ACT!, just follow these steps:
1. Create a lookup of the contacts for whom you want to create labels or
envelopes.
142
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

If you’re creating a personalized mailing, I’d guess that you’ve already
created a lookup of the contacts that get the mailing. By creating the
corresponding labels using the existing lookup, you’re guaranteed to
have the same number of contacts and to have your labels print in the
same sort order.
2. Choose File➪Print from any ACT! window.
3. Choose either Labels or Envelopes from the Printout Type list.
From this point forward, I focus on creating labels, but these directions
also work for envelopes. Just substitute the word envelope for the word
label in any of the directions.
4. Select a template from the list and click the Print button.
The available label templates are listed on the Paper Type area of the
dialog box.
Notice that all the labels are Avery labels. Chances are that even if
you’re using a generic label, you find the magic words Same as Avery
Label #XX printed on the side of the box.
The Define Filters dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
5. In the Send the Report Output To drop-down menu, choose your print
option.
You’ll find all the same printing options that you have when you print
reports. Theoretically, you could save your labels in HTML format or
e-mail them to someone. Previewing the labels before printing them is
always a good idea. You can then print them directly from the Preview
screen if everything looks hunky-dory.
Figure 9-7:
The Define
Filters
dialog box.
143
Chapter 9: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

6. In the Create Report For area, specify whether you want to create
labels for the Current Contact, the Current Lookup, or All Contacts.
If you’ve sorted your database, choose the Current Lookup option to
retain the sorting, even if you’re printing your entire database.
7. Select All Users or Selected Users from the Use Data Managed By area.
This option refers to the Record Manager of each contact. You might
want to print labels for just your own contacts.
8. Click the Position tab.
This is how you’re going to make your first million dollars. According 
to the rules of probability — or just your dumb luck — chances are that
if you use labels that come 30 to a page, you end up needing 32 labels.
This leaves you with a sheet of 28 unusable labels — unless you use
ACT!, that is. The Position tab allows you to start printing your labels 
on the appropriate spot on your page.
9. Click OK.
You’re now the proud owner of a beautiful set of labels.
Modifying Labels and Envelopes
You might decide that your labels or envelopes need a little extra pizzazz.
Maybe you want to add another field or make a field longer. Maybe you think
a font change is in order. Most modifications that you have in mind can be
accomplished from either the label or envelope template editor:
1. Choose File➪Print from any ACT! screen.
2. Choose either Labels or Envelopes from the Printout Type list and
select the label or envelope type that you’d like to modify. For our
purposes we’re going to choose Labels; however, you’d follow the
same steps if you were modifying an Envelope template.
3. Click the Edit Template button to make changes to an existing label
template.
The Label Designer dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-8. The Label
Designer toolbox also opens; you recognize this toolbox if you design
layouts (Chapter 14) or reports (Chapter 10) in ACT!. 
4. Before making adjustments to the existing label formats, save the tem-
plate using another name by choosing File➪Save As, typing the name
of the template in the File Name field, and then clicking OK.
The next time that you run a set of labels, the template that you create
appears as one of the label template choices.
144

5. Modify the label formats to your heart’s content:
• To delete a field: Click the Pointer tool in the top left corner of the
toolbox, click a field, and then press Delete.
• To move a field: Click the Pointer tool in the toolbox and drag a
field to a new position.
• To change the font for a field: Double-click a field and then choose
the Font menu to specify a different font, size, or attribute.
• To add a field: Click the Field tool and draw a rectangle to indicate
where you want to place the field. You’re then prompted to select
the name of the field you wish to add.
• To close the template: Choose File➪Close and then click Yes to
save.
6. Click OK. 
If the label that you ordinarily use isn’t listed, changing your labels to corre-
spond to one of the labels listed in ACT! is probably your easiest choice. But
if you rely on a special label, you can create a document template that corre-
sponds with the dimensions of your labels. Check out Chapter 11 to find out
how to create custom templates.
Figure 9-8:
The Label
Designer
dialog box.
145
Chapter 9: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

As you poke around in the various templates, notice a few fields labeled
Custom. Avoid the tendency to delete these custom fields — they’re there for
a reason. The custom field at the top of the label provides the contact name
using the Prefix, First Name, Last Name, and Suffix. The custom field at the
bottom provides the City, State, and Zip code. The custom fields can be
moved, resized, and the font changed, but they should not be deleted.
Working with Quick Report
I like to think of the ability to print the various ACT! lists and tabs as some-
what of a secret weapon. By being able to print these lists, you can report
quickly on just about anything that you can view throughout your database.
This ability enables you to quickly create a report based on the specifications
and criteria that you need immediately.
You’re able to create a Quick Report for the following ACT! lists:
 Contact List
 Task List
 Group List
 Company List
You can also create a Quick Report for the following system tabs in the
Contact, Group, or Company Detail windows:
 Notes
 History
 Activities
 Opportunities
 Groups/Companies
 Secondary Contacts
 Documents
Basically, if you’re viewing a list, such as the Task List, ACT! can print the list.
If you’re viewing a tab that contains a list of items, such as the Notes, History,
or Opportunities tab, ACT! can print those items as well.
146

Creating a Quick Report
Follow these steps to create a report:
1. Display the list view or tab that you want to print.
• To display a list, such as the Task List or Contact List, choose View
and then the appropriate list.
• To display a tab, click the tab from the Contact, Group, or Company
Detail window.
2. Arrange the columns exactly as you want them to appear on your
printout.
If you need help adding/removing columns or changing the order or size
of existing columns, check out Chapter 5.
All the lists and tabs that you see in ACT! are customized in exactly the
same way.
3. Choose File➪Quick Print Current Window.
The Windows Print dialog box opens.
4. Click OK.
Some of you might be thinking that you can print a Quick Report pretty
quickly. You’re right! Guess that’s why they’re called Quick Reports!
Setting the Quick Report preferences
You can read in the preceding section that when you run a Quick Report, it
moves along quickly. You’re not asked for any customization options other
than your initial determination of the columns and column order that you
wish to print. Quick Print preferences allow you to modify the content of the
headers and footers that appear on all your Quick Reports.
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from any ACT! screen.
2. Click the Communication tab and then click the Quick Print
Preferences button.
The Quick Print Preferences dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-9.
3. Select a view from the When Printing This section.
You might want a Quick Report of your companies to look differently
than the Quick Reports of your opportunities. Here’s where you get to
assign the various attributes for each view you plan to print.

4. Choose from the following options for both the header and footer for
each view that you choose.
• Font
• Page Number
• Print Date
• Print Time
• My Record

A
CT! comes with 40 reports right out of the box. Chances are that one of
these reports can give you exactly the information that you need, and
Chapter 9 shows you how to run any of the existing ACT! reports. But, just in
case you can’t find exactly the report you want, this chapter shows you how
to create brand new reports or modify an existing one. If you want to add it to
the Reports menu after designing a report, head to Chapter 3, where I show
you how.
Understanding the Report Designer
Designing a database report can be a bit intimidating if you’ve never done it
before. I like to think that you can tackle the chore of creating a report in one of
two ways: the hard way or the easy way. The hard way consists of creating a
brand new report entirely from scratch, which entails placing each and every
element of your report onto a blank report template. The easy way consists of
taking an existing report that’s kinda what you’re looking for and modifying it.
You might want to open the Act8demo database and print out a page of each
of the existing ACT! reports for reference. Doing so helps you decide which
report works as the best starting point for your modifications.
Being familiar with the structure of your existing database can prove helpful
when you attempt to create a report. Thus, you need to know the field names
that you’re working with as well as their location in ACT!. For example, if you
want to include the name of a company, you must know that the field is called
Company and that you find the field in the Contact Detail window. If you want
to include notes that you’ve added, you must know to include the Regarding
field from the Notes tab.

Before starting to create or modify a report, create a lookup of the contacts
that you’re including in your report. This step is optional but can be timesav-
ing. As you design your report, you’ll notice that sometimes certain fields
aren’t large enough to contain their data or that columns don’t line up cor-
rectly. By creating a lookup, you can check the progress of your report-
designing efforts by running a preview of your report each time that you add
a new element to it.
Mastering ACT! Report Basics
After you pick the report you want to modify — or decide that you’re a glut-
ton for punishment and start from scratch — you’re ready to begin.
1. Choose the Reports menu from any ACT! screen.
You have two choices here:
• New Template: Even if you choose this option, ACT! shows you a
list of all the report templates. The top choice, Empty Report, is
the one you want to choose if you’re adventurous enough to want
to start working without a net.
Yikes! The problem with designing an ACT! report from scratch is,
well, that you have to create the report from scratch. As shown in
Figure 10-1, a blank template with Header, Detail, and Footer sec-
tion titles appears on the left.
• Edit Template: For me and most ACT! users, this choice is safer. You
can now open the report that most closely matches your desired
results. To make things even less confusing, you’ll discover that
the filenames of the reports match the names of the reports.
Compare Figures 10-1 and 10-2 to see the difference between a
blank report and an existing one.
Notice what appear to be duplicate fields. The first field that you see is
the Field label. You can edit any of these labels by double-clicking the
label, and then typing in any desired changes. You can distinguish the
field itself by the colon that appears in each field. The actual data from
your ACT! database appears in this area when you run the report. The
letter in front of the colon indicates the Field type. For example, if you
add your name in the Header section, the field appears as My:Contact. If
you add a contact’s company, it appears on the report template as
C:Company.
2. From the Report Designer, choose File➪Save As.
I highly recommend giving your report a brand new name even if you’re
just tweaking an existing report. That way, you still have the original
report to go back to, just in case.
3. Fill in a name for your new report and then click Save.

Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

Saving early and often
Creating a report requires a great deal of patience. Even the most expert of
report designers run into problems at times or (gasp) make a mistake.
Imagine how you’d feel if after spending several hours working on a report,
you made a huge mistake without realizing it until you ran your report for the
first time. You’d head back to the drawing board (none too happily, I might
add). For that reason, I suggest that you keep repeating the following proce-
dure each and every time you make a change to the structure of your report.
From the Report Designer, choose File➪Print Preview and give your report a
good examination:
 If you like what you see, close Print Preview and choose File➪Save. Your
changes are now safe and sound.
 If something is wrong in Houston, or at least somewhere in the body of
your report, close Print Preview and then close the Report Designer
without saving your changes. Cutting your losses is easier now rather
than trying to untangle the mess you might inadvertently create later on.
Most of you have discovered the wonderful Undo feature that allows you to
take back what you just did. You can “undo” an incorrect change to your
report template by choosing Edit➪Undo (or holding down the Ctrl key and
tapping the Z key on your keyboard). Unfortunately, you’ll find that very
often the Undo won’t work in the report designer. All the more reason to 
save early and often. Talk about working without a net!
Using the toolbox and properties
An ACT! report template consists of a number of elements. For example, you
might have your company logo at the top of your report and a series of
column headings that appear at the top of each page in your report. ACT!’s
Report Designer lets you modify those various elements using the toolbox
and Properties features.
Tooling around in the toolbox
Refer to Figure 10-2 to see the toolbox running along the left-hand side of the
Report Designer. It consists of the following eight tools:
 Pointer: You must click the Pointer tool in order to select any element in
the Report Designer that you wish to modify.
 Field: Click this tool if you want to add a new field to the body of your
report.
 Text: This tool allows you to create a descriptive text box.
152
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others

 Rectangle: As its name implies, this tool allows you to draw a box or rec-
tangle in your report. Use this option to highlight a section of your
report. The rectangle is also used to create lines by making the border
and background solid and the same color.
 Picture: This tool allows you to add a graphic, such as your company
logo, to your report.
 Picture Field: This tool allows you to add a contact’s picture to your
report.
 System Field: This tool allows you to add fields including date, time, and
number of pages in your report.
 Subreport: Using this tool shows multiple objects for each contact in a
report. For example, you might want to show activity information for
each contact listed on a contact report.
Using the properties properly
In addition to the toolbox, the Report Designer comes equipped with a
Properties window guaranteed to give you more options than your local ice
cream store. The Properties window runs along the right side of the Report
Designer (refer to Figure 10-2). You can see what I mean by the options avail-
able to you. The purpose of the Properties window is to show you all the
applied formatting of the currently selected element.
Feel like the Properties window is infringing on your territory? You can send
it packing. A simple press of the F4 key closes the Properties window. Want to
bring it back? Simply press F4 again.
If you want to move the toolbox or Properties window out of the way, just
double-click the window title bar. Each of these windows now detach them-
selves from the side of your screen. At this point, you can drag them to what-
ever area of the Report Designer you’re not using. Want to put them back?
Double-click the title bar and whoosh!, there it is!
The Properties window reflects the properties of the field or element that’s
currently selected. The left side of the Properties window lists all the aspects
available for the field or element that you select. The right side shows you
the currently selected choice. If you want to change any particular aspect,
simply click the option on the right side and choose a different formatting
option from the drop-down list that appears. For example, if I want to change
a font color from black to red, I click the word black that appears to the right
of the font color and then choose red from the drop-down list.
You can also use the Properties window to change the attributes of several
elements at the same time. You can click several elements at the same time
by holding down either the Shift or the Control key while clicking the ele-
ments you want to change. After you make your selection, you can change as
many attributes as you want all in one fell swoop.
153
Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

Changing the Report Content
I mention earlier that chances are that you began with a basic report and
decided to modify it somewhat — or even give it a complete makeover.
Probably the first thing you want to do is decide which fields will — or won’t —
appear in your report. After you make that momentous decision, you might
decide to tweak the order of the fields. Of course, then you’re going to have 
to realign some of the fields that you moved so that they line up in an orderly
fashion. You also have to decide how long a field should be — for example, the
State field needs to house only 2 letters, but the City field might need to hold
30. Whew! You have a lot of work to do, so read on!
Working with existing fields
Start by tweaking some of the fields already on your report template. You
could start by removing some of the fields from the Contact Report, or you
might want to make the font a wee bit larger to accommodate your 40-some-
thing eyes. The more ornery members of the crowd might not be happy with
the order in which the fields appear in one of the opportunity reports. Like
anything else, it’s simple if you know the trick.
1. From the Report Designer, click the Pointer tool in the toolbox.
2. Select the fields you want to modify.
To select multiple fields, hold down the Shift or Control key while click-
ing any additional fields. If you’re a mouse lover, you can also drag your
rodent around several adjoining fields to select them.
You can identify selected fields by the little boxes that now appear along
their edges and centers.
After you select the fields you want to work with, you can change your selec-
tion in a number of ways:
 To change field properties: Select an item from the Report Designer
Properties window and edit the properties. You can also select font
attributes such as bolding, centering, and size from the Report Designer
toolbar.
 To delete a field or a field label: Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Many of the ACT! reports include custom fields, which contain special
scripts to make the reports do special things. Refrain from deleting
those custom fields unless you can completely determine their function.
 To resize a field: Grab one of the selection handles on either side of the
field and drag to either the left or right, depending on whether you want
the field larger or smaller.
154
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others

 To move a field: Place your cursor in the middle of a field or group of
fields and drag them to the desired location.
 To align fields: First select all the secondary fields and then select the
anchor field. The anchor field is the one that is correctly placed on the
report template and the one you should click last; all the other fields are
the ones that you want to align horizontally or vertically with the anchor
field. Choose Format➪Align from the Report Designer menu and indicate
how to line up the fields.
As you modify and move fields, you’ll probably start to notice that the
fields no longer line up as neatly as they once did. Although you can
physical drag a field or fields around in an attempt to line them back up
again, you’ll probably end up wasting a lot of your valuable time. Using
the Align Fields options is much more accurate — and better on your
blood pressure!
You can distinguish between the anchor field and the other fields that you
select by carefully examining the selection handles. If you look at Figure 10-3,
the anchor field has light gray handles, whereas the secondary fields all have
black ones.
Adding a field
After you modify, move, and delete fields from your template, you might want
to start adding in a few additional fields. If so, follow these additional steps.
A dozen of the basic ACT! reports are invisible to the naked eye — or at least
not seen on the Report menus. Save yourself a bunch of time and check
whether one of those reports fits the bill. It’s always easier to delete and
move existing reports rather than having to add new ones. You can see a list
of those reports in Chapter 9.
1. In the Report Designer, click the Field tool in the toolbox.
2. Place your cursor on the template where you want to insert a field
and then drag down and to the right to define the field’s length and
position.

Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

Most probably, you want to add the new field to the Detail section of
your report. However, you can also add fields to any of the other sec-
tions, including the header and footer as well.
You can read more about the other sections later in this chapter. When
you work with a report, you might find it helpful to enlarge the sections
to give you a bit more elbowroom. You can do this by grabbing the gray
horizontal line that appears at the bottom of each section and dragging
it down an inch or two. Just remember to drag the section line back up
again when you’re finished adding new fields to avoid seeing huge gaps
between the lines of your report.
When you release the mouse button, the Select Field dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 10-4. You can now choose any of your existing ACT!
fields to add to the report templates.
3. Select the record type that you want to add from the Select a Record
Type drop-down list.
Typically, you want to add a new Contact field to the body of your report.
However, you might decide to add My Record fields to the header so that
your name and other pertinent information appears at the top of the
report. You might also want to include Secondary Contact information.
You can even choose to add Activity, History, Note, and Opportunity
fields to your report.
As you make a record type selection, notice that the list of fields
changes. If you decide to add a Note field, the choices include Date and
Time, whereas a selection of Contact Opportunity allows you to include
any of your Opportunity fields.

Field dialog

4. Indicate whether you want to include a field label.
A label appears on the report regardless of whether any information
appears in the field. If you don’t want to include a field label for a field in
the template, deselect (clear) the Include a Label check box.
5. Click the Add button.
The Report Designer now contains the fields and field labels that you
added. Refer to Figure 10-2 for an example of a report template that con-
tains several sections, subsections, and fields.
6. Continue adding additional fields if desired. Click the Close button
when you finish adding new fields.
ACT!’s Report Designer is deceptively powerful. Although it is beyond the
scope of this book, an advanced user can add custom fields to any of the
ACT! reports. These custom fields contain Visual Basic scripting, which 
can let the ACT! reports return information in just about any form.
Adding a summary field
After you add a field to a report template, you might want to add a summary
field. Summary fields can be used to give you a count of all the contacts that
appear in a report or a total for a column containing numeric data.
1. Add the field in the Report Designer that you want to convert into a
summary field.
Although this sounds fairly straight-forward, you’ve got several things to
think about here:
• Summary fields usually appear above or below the rest of your
data, so you’ll probably want to put these fields in your headers or
footers.
• The summary fields usually match the data type and field. In other
words, if you want a count of all your contacts, your summary field
will be the Contact contact field. If you want a total of all your
sales, the summary field will be the Total opportunity field.
• The data doesn’t actually have to appear in the report in order to
be summarized. For example, you might want to have a list of con-
tacts with a total representing the number of purchases they’ve
made.
2. Right-click in the field and choose Properties from the Field
Properties displayed.
157
Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

3. Click the Data tab and select the Summary option from the Field Type
area.
You can check out the Data tab of the Field Properties dialog box in
Figure 10-5.
Your summary options include
• Count (count): This field counts the number of records for the
selected field.
• Total (sum): This field calculates the total of all values in the
selected field.
• Average (avg): This field calculates the average of all values in the
selected field.
• Minimum (min): This field finds the lowest number or earliest date
in the selected field.
• Maximum (max): This field finds the highest number or latest date
in the selected field.
If some of the options are grayed out, those options don’t apply to the
field that you selected. For example, I could count a list of contacts, but I
can’t add them together because you can’t add character fields.
4. Click OK to add the field to your report.
After you create a summary field, you’ll recognize it because ACT!
inserts several letters in front of the field name to indicate the type of
summary field that you just created. To make life easy for you, I included
clues for you in the parentheses above.

Filtering Data in a Report Template
Just like you can filter heaven knows what out of your water, you can filter
data out of a report. You can change the filters each time that you run a
report, or you can include filters in your report template to save you from
having to do it later. Any filters that you set become defaults that you can
change later when you actually run the report. Here’s all you need to do to
add that timesaving feature to your report templates.
1. Choose Edit➪Define Filters from the Report Designer.
The Define Filters dialog box appears. You can sneak a peak at it in
Figure 10-6.
The Define Filters dialog box is divided into five tabs. Depending on the
type of report you’re creating, some of the tabs might not be available:
• General: Selects the default output for the report, the contacts to
include, and the Record Manager of the contacts
• Activity: Lets you select whether you want to include calls, meet-
ings, to-do’s, and cleared activities within a given date range
• Note: Lets you specify the date range and creator of the notes to
appear in a report
• History: Lets you determine whether you want to include histories,
e-mails, and attachments within a given date range
• Opportunity: Lets you filter for Sales Opportunities as well as
Closed and Lost Sales within a given date range
2. Select the data to include in the report from the Activity, Note,
History, and Opportunity tabs, and then click OK.
Figure 10-6:
The Report
Designer
Define
Filters
dialog box.
159
Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

Chapter 9 warns you that you need to change the report filters each 
and every time you run a report if you don’t like the default values. By
default, the notes, history, and activity reports all display information
from last month. If you run these reports on a weekly basis, here’s your
chance to change those defaults.
Sectioning Your ACT! Report
You create sections in a report template to help you organize the information
that you want to include in your report. In general, the main information that
you’re reporting on appears in the body of the report. However, you might
want your own contact information to appear on the first page of your reports,
the page number to appear at the top of every page, the date and time to show
up on the bottom of each page, and your totals to magically materialize on the
very last page. In this section I’ll show you how to do just that.
Defining report sections
A report template is divided into sections of information. Each section has a
section title that appears in the report template but doesn’t appear in the
report itself. You can determine which fields you want to appear in each
given section. A report template consists of five main sections; you can’t
delete or change the order of the sections, but you can hide a section if you
don’t want it to appear in your report (see “Hiding a report section” later in
this chapter. The five main sections are
 Report Header: Information that appears at the top of the first page of
the report, such as the report’s title and creator.
 Page Header: Information that appears at the top of each page, such as
column headings.
 Detail: The area that contains one or more of your Contact or Group
fields. The Detail section is the meat and potatoes of the report where
you find pertinent information, such as the contact’s name, address, and
phone number.
 Page Footer: Information that appears at the bottom of each page in
your report, such as the date and page number.
 Footer: Information that appears at the bottom of the last page of your
report, such as a recap or a grand total.
You can resize a section to make room for additional fields by dragging the
horizontal gray line that appears at the bottom of the section lower on the
template.
160
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others

After you fiddle with your report template and have it exactly the way you
want it, don’t forget to resize each section back to the original size — or close
it up as much as possible. Any blank areas in a section appear as blank areas
in your report!
Modifying report sections
Most of you will be quite happy to rely on the five default report sections.
However, from time to time, you might want to get a bit fancier. Maybe you
want to list each of your contacts alphabetically by last name grouped by
city. You need to create subsections within your report to accomplish this.
Not a problem; here’s all you need to do:
1. In the Report Designer, double-click any section header.
The Define Sections dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-7. Notice
that in addition to adding subsections, you can choose a few other
options as well:
• Page Break: Indicates whether you want to have each section appear
on a new sheet of paper or start a new sheet at the end of a section.
• Collapse if Blank: Closes up a section if no information is contained
in it.
• Allow Section to Break Across Multiple Pages: Allows a long section
to continue on to multiple pages.
2. Click the Add button to add a new section to the report.
The Select a Field to Group By dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-7:
The Report
Designer
Define
Sections
dialog box.
161
Chapter 10: Designing Your Own Reports

3. Select the field you want to use to group your report and then click OK.
In Figure 10-8, you can see how I decided to group my reports by city.
4. Select an ascending order from the Define Sections dialog box.
Once you select the field you wish to group on in Step 3 above, you’ll be
returned to the Define Sections dialog box. The new section will be high-
lighted, and you’ll be able to indicate whether the new section appears
in ascending or descending alphabetical order.
After you create a new subsection, you can place as many fields on it as you
want using the techniques in the “Adding a field” section earlier in this chapter.
Hiding a report section
There might be times when you’ll want to hide a section. For example, let’s
say you want a report that counts the number of contacts in each of your
ID/Status fields. Theoretically ACT! needs to list all those contacts so that
they can be counted, yet you really don’t want to see all those contacts
because you are only interested in seeing a total. Although you can’t remove
any of the default report template sections, you can hide them, which gives
you the same result. To hide a section
1. In the Report Designer, open the Properties window by choosing
View➪Properties Window.
2. Select the name of the section that you wish to hide.
3. Click the Visible property in the Properties window and change it 
to No.
Although you can still see the section in the Report Designer, it doesn’t
appear in your finished reports.

Merging Your Information
into a Document
In This Chapter
 Understanding mail merge
 Choosing your word processor
 Creating a document template
 Converting existing templates
 Using the Mail Merge Wizard
A
particularly useful ACT! feature enables you to create customized docu-
ment templates: forms in which ACT! fills in your selected data fields.
You can send these forms to a thousand people as easily as you can send
them to just one person. You can send out routine documents one at a time
on a continual basis, or you can send out the document one time to all or
part of your database. After you create a form, you can send it out via snail
mail, e-mail, fax, or Pony Express.
Mail Merge Isn’t Just about Mailing
Poor mail merge! Folks often have two common misconceptions about mail
merge. Some people think that mail merge is synonymous with junk mail. Also,
the word mail makes some folks think postage stamps are involved. However,
neither of these common misconceptions are true. A mail merge simply takes
the content of one or more fields and puts that content into a template or form.
A good way to understand the concept of mail merge is to visualize this
simple equation:
template + data field(s) = personalized document
Note the (s) at the end of data field, suggesting that you can use either one
name or many names. Some of you might think that you will never perform a

mail merge because you have no desire to send out a mass mailing. Others of
you might have already perfected the art of mass mailing but never realized
that a mail merge can be directed to one person or to thousands of people. I
hate to be the one to break your bubble, but if you have any kind of routine
documents that you’re generating repetitively, you should be using ACT!’s
mail merge to do it.
The three things necessary to create a mail merge are
 A name or a list of names: If you’ve followed this book to this point,
you’re the happy owner of a database and know how to create a lookup.
(Don’t know how to create a lookup? Better check out Chapter 6.) You
can merge a document with your current contact, your current lookup,
or the entire database.
 A program that can combine the names into the template: After you
have a list of names and a document template, you need something to
combine them. You could try to use your food processor, but I prefer
to use the mail merge feature in ACT!.
 A document template: A document template is a letter or form that substi-
tutes field names in place of names and addresses or whatever other
information comes directly from your database. ACT! comes with a
number of document templates that you can either use as is or modify.
You can also create your own document templates by using a word
processor.
Picking Your Word Processor
ACT! can use either its own word processor or Microsoft Word to create doc-
ument templates. By default, ACT! is set to use its own word processor. Most
ACT! users prefer using Word as their word processor, and I assume that
you’re no different. Although the ACT! word processor gets the job done,
chances are that you’re already using Word — and using an application that
you’re already familiar with is preferable. You’ll also find that the ACT! word
processor offers a far smaller array of features than Word.
If your word processing preferences inside ACT! aren’t set to use Microsoft
Word as your default word processor, you can’t use existing Word templates
or any templates that you created by using Word. To change your word
processor settings, follow these handy-dandy directions:
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from the Contact Detail window.
2. On the Communication tab, select a word processor from the Word
Processor list.
In this case, you’re choosing Microsoft Word.
3. Click OK.

Chapter 11: Merging Your Information into a Document
Using the out-of-the-box templates
For those of you all set to write The Great
American Novel, you might want to create all
your own original documents. That’s great, and
I recommend that you skip to the section
“Creating a Document Template.” The rest of
you might be interested in perusing some of the
great templates that come prepackaged in
ACT!. Even if you decide that these templates
aren’t exactly what you’re looking for, you can
use them as a starting point for developing your
own unique document templates.
The following figure shows you the Open dialog
box that appears when you choose Write➪Other
Document from any of the ACT! windows.
You might want to run each of the templates one
time to determine which ones you think will be
most useful to you. Later in the section entitled
“Creating a Document template,” you find out
how to modify them to your heart’s content. Right
now, I want to point out three of my favorites that
you might want to focus on. These three docu-
ment templates are listed for you right up there
on ACT!’s Write menu because you’ll probably
use these three templates the most often.
 E-mail Message: The E-mail Message tem-
plate is based on a template with the crazy-
sounding file name of emailbody.adt.
Because you’ll probably be sending a lot of
e-mail using ACT!, you’ll want to polish up
this template. The emailbody.adt tem-
plate pops up when you choose Write➪
E-Mail Message from any of the ACT! win-
dows or when you click a contact’s e-mail
address.
 Letter: The Letter (Letter.adt) template
is a great template to use when you need to
create a letter on the fly to one of your con-
tacts. It automatically dates a letter and
addresses it to your current contact. It even
includes your name, company, and title on
the bottom (the closing). All you need to do
is fill in the body of the letter and stick on
the stamp! You can also use this template
as boilerplate for creating the rest of your
form letters.
 Fax Cover Page: If you feel that you have no
need for ACT!’s fax cover page because you
already created something rather spiffy
using Word, you can convert that Word doc-
ument into an ACT! template to have ACT!
automatically fill in all the necessary fields
for you. Use the Fax Cover Page.adt
template for this.
(continued)

Creating a Document Template
Before you can win friends and influence prospects with your dazzling dis-
play of personalized documents, you need two basic elements: the data and
the document template.
You’re creating a template, not a document, to perform your mail merge. A
document is a plain old file that you create and use in Word. You use it once,
save it, and store it away for posterity or delete it as soon as you’re done with
it. Comparatively, a template is a form that merges with your contact informa-
tion. The convenience of templates is that you use them over and over again.
With your data tucked away nicely in your database, all you have left to do is
to create the document template, which involves creating a form document.
Your document template contains placeholders that are then filled in with
information from your database after you perform a merge. Create a docu-
ment template by following these steps:
1. Choose Write➪New Letter/E-Mail Template.
If you chose Word to be your word processor of choice, try not to look
too surprised when Word opens. (To review how to set this preference,
see the preceding section.)
2. Resist the urge to close the Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box that’s
obscuring a portion of Word.
The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-1, is the
main event of this little procedure. If you scroll through the Add Mail
Merge Fields list, the various field names should ring a bell. After all —
they’re all your database fields.
You can drag those pesky fields out of your way by placing your mouse
pointer on the Add Mail Merge Fields title bar and dragging this dialog
box out of the way.
166
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 
You’ll notice the Other Document (from tem-
plate) choice on the Write menu. Click it and
you’ll find all the ACT! templates. Two templates
contain graphics and are ready to send via
e-mail; unfortunately, they work only when you
set your word processor template to the ACT!
word processor.
 ENewsletter
 Special Offer
You might want to hold off using the Quote 
template — it’s designed for use with the oppor-
tunities you create. Flip to Chapter 19 for more
details.
(continued)

3. Change all your document settings.
Go ahead and change your font, margins, and other formatting items
exactly as if you’re working in a regular ol’ Word document.
4. Create the body of your letter or form.
Nothing new under the sun here. You can backspace, delete, and type
just like you do in any Word document.
5. Click the spot in your document where you want to insert a field.
6. Determine what type of field you want to insert into your template.
The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box allows you to insert three different
types of field information.
• Contact: If you want your contacts’ information to appear when you
perform a mail merge, you need to insert a Contact field into your
template. In a letter, the name at the top that you’re sending the
letter to is the Contact field.
Whatever information you’ve entered into a field appears in the
merged document. If any of the fields in the contact record are
empty, ACT! skips that field; you don’t see a blank line. In Figure 11-1,
I inserted the Company field; however, if your contact isn’t associ-
ated with a company, that line is skipped.
• Field Label: Selecting the Field Label option inserts the name of the
field, not the information contained in that field. You might wonder
Figure 11-1:
The Add
Mail Merge
Fields
dialog box.
167
Chapter 11: Merging Your Information into a Document

why you want to go through the effort of scrolling through the list
of field names to insert a label when you could just as easily type
in the field label. I wonder the same thing!
• My Record: If you want your own contact information to appear,
select the My Record field option. If you’re creating a letter docu-
ment template, the name that appears at the bottom (in the closing)
is your name and is represented by the My Record field option.
Your My Record information resides on the first contact record
that appears when you open an ACT! database.
7. Insert fields where you want contact information to appear.
Here’s where the fun begins. Every time you get to a part that could be
populated with ACT! information, you must scroll down that long list of
fields, select the one to insert into your template, and the click Add.
The field name appears in your document set off by a set of lovely angle
brackets. Treat these field names exactly as you do any other words in
your template. For example, if you want to see them set in bold, bold the
field name. You’ll also want to place the appropriate punctuation next to
an inserted field if necessary; you’ll note that in Figure 11-2 that the
<Salutation> field in the greeting line is followed by a colon.
8. Check your document for accuracy and edit as necessary.
9. Choose File➪Save As.
Okay, I know that you probably already know how to save a document in
Word, but I want to draw your attention to an interesting phenomenon
that occurs when saving an ACT! document template in Word. Your doc-
ument is automatically saved with the .adt extension. And, unless you
specify otherwise, your template is saved to your default template
folder. In Chapter 3, I show you how to determine the location in which
to save your templates and also how to add a document template to
the Write menu.
Document templates created with the ACT! word processor end in the
extension .tpl.
After you create a template, you can change it whenever the need arises. For
example, you might discover a spelling mistake. Or the contact fields that
you’re using might not work correctly, or they lack proper punctuation. You
might even want to make changes to the wording in some of the templates,
including the out-of-the-box templates. The procedure for editing your docu-
ment template varies only slightly from that of creating the document:
1. Choose Write➪Edit Template.
2. When the Open dialog box appears, select the document template that
you want to open and then click Open.
The template opens in Word, and the Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box
automatically appears (refer to Figure 11-1).
168
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

When you edit an existing template, you see your field names in angle
brackets within the document rather than your data. If you see actual
data, you aren’t editing the template, and the changes that you make
affect only the current document that you’re in; your document template
remains unchanged.
3. Make the appropriate changes to the template.
4. Click Save when you finish editing.
In general, using an existing template is easier than creating a new template
from scratch. Basically, to create a new template, you simply open a similar
template and follow the same procedure as if you’re editing an existing tem-
plate — but save the file with a different name. Or, if the document already
exists in Word, you might want to first open the existing document in Word,
highlight the information that you want to appear in your template, copy it
to the Clipboard, and then paste it into the new template.
Grappling with Graphics
You might want to think of e-mail merging as a good news, bad news kind of
situation. The good news is you can read here how to create a template and
e-mail it out to the entire world. The bad news is that you probably need to
understand a little more about the technology that is involved in placing
graphics into e-mail.
Basically, the two kinds of e-mail templates that you can create are
 Plain text: These templates consist of plain old, black-and-white 
verbiage.
 HTML: These templates are colorful and very often contain graphics.
Any of the templates that you create following the techniques in the previous
section can be transmitted via either mail or e-mail. These templates can all
contain merge fields so that your written letters and your e-mail can be per-
sonalized to contain any of the information found on a contact’s record. They
can be created using any of your font attributes including font type, size,
color, bolding, italics, and underlining. You can even add a graphic — but not
if you plan on e-mailing the template.
So, what’s the hang-up? In a word — graphics. Those company logos that you
want to include in your templates can prove to be quite annoying, trouble-
some, and just downright exasperating. Graphics need to be properly embed-
ded into the body of your template or linked to graphics that are hosted on
your Web site in order to avoid being sent as an attachment.
169
Chapter 11: Merging Your Information into a Document

Think about it — have you ever received an e-mail from someone with a
graphic attached to it? You open that e-mail and see a big white box with
a tiny red X somewhere in it. Puzzled, you open the attachment and see a
logo. This is a perfect example of someone who forayed into the exciting
world of graphics and lost the battle. Here are a few tips to consider before
sticking a graphic into one of your templates:
 Word: If you choose Word as your word processor preference, you need
to insert the proper HyperText Markup Language (HTML) code into your
template. The best way to accomplish this is to create the contents of
your e-mail in a program that can save it as HTML code, such as Microsoft
FrontPage. You can then insert the HTML-coded file into your Word 
template.
Still feeling dazed and confused when it comes to sending HTML e-mail?
Consider using an add-on product to help you create those templates.
You can read about one of my favorites, Swift Page E-mail, in Chapter 24.
 ACT! word processor: Consider using the ACT! word processor if you’re
intent on sending HTML e-mail and don’t want to rely on any other prod-
uct. The ACT! word processor lets you insert a graphic into your tem-
plate and automatically embed it as long as your graphic is stored in the
same folder as your template.
Don’t lull yourself into thinking that your e-mail is going to properly transmit
just because it looks perfect when you edit or preview your template. Consider
creating a free Yahoo! or Hotmail e-mail account and send a trial e-mail there to
make sure the graphics display properly before sending them off to the outside
world!
Reaching an Audience of One
Don’t assume that creating a mail merge implies sending out a single message
to thousands of people at one time. A mail merge can also be used to auto-
mate the most mundane and routine of tasks. You can use ACT!’s document
templates to write a thank-you letter every time that you land a new client or
to write an inquiry letter each time that you receive a new lead. After you dis-
cover this timesaver, I guarantee that you’ll never go back to your old way of
creating documents again!
To send a document to a single member of your database, follow these steps:
1. Create a lookup to find the contact to whom you want to send a letter.
Feel free to turn to Chapter 6 if you need help creating a lookup.
The current contact record that you have displayed is the one whose
information fills in your template.
170
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

2. Choose Write and then choose Letter, Memo, Fax Cover Page, or Other
Document.
You can modify any of the ACT! menus. You might want to modify the
Write menu to include some of your own templates. Flip over to Chapter
3 if you need a little refresher course in adding new items to an ACT!
menu. As you start creating new templates, you can add corresponding
menu items to the Write menu.
3. Complete the body of the document.
Depending on the type of document that you choose to create and the
modifications that you made to the document template, you’re looking
at the start of a document. For example, by choosing to create a letter,
the name, address, salutation, and closing are already provided. You just
need to add the body of the letter to complete it. If you choose Other
Document, you can choose either one of the other ACT!’s templates or
one of your own. These, of course, already include the body as well.
If you chose to create a fax cover sheet, you need merely to add the
number of pages in the transmittal and an optional comment to proceed.
4. (Optional) Save your document.
After you complete your document, you can save it to the location of
your choice. If you don’t think that it’s necessary to save the document
that you create from a template (because you can so easily re-create
them), you aren’t required to.
5. Print, fax, or e-mail your document.
If you use Word as the default word processor to create your ACT! docu-
ments, you can now print, fax, and e-mail exactly like you’re already
used to doing in Word.
If you choose to print, the Create History dialog box appears after print-
ing is complete (see Figure 11-2). Now this is cool. I like to refer to this as
the “Would you like fries with that?” step. After you create a document
using a document template, ACT! will create a record of the document
on the History tab. You now have a history of the date on which you
sent a document. Better yet, other people in your organization are also
aware of your interactions with the contact. If you don’t want to record a
history, select the No, Do Not Record History radio button.
• To attach the document to a note on the History tab: Select the Attach
Document to History check box. When you enable this option, a
shortcut to the document is automatically added to the History tab;
you can access the document by double-clicking the attachment.
• To have additional information appear in the note that’s added to the
History tab: Enter a description of the document in the Regarding
field. This description appears on the History tab regardless of
whether you saved the document or not.
171
Chapter 11: Merging Your Information into a Document

• If you don’t want to create a history for the document: Select the No,
Do Not Record History radio button.
• To specify whether to print an envelope for the contact: You have to
hand it to ACT!: The program really tries to be as accommodating
as possible. After you work your fingers to the bone creating your
latest tome, ACT! gently asks you whether you want to print an enve-
lope. If you select No, you’re done with the letter-writing process.
After you complete the special order for your mail merge, all that’s
left to do is to click the OK button, close your word processor, and
return to ACT!. If you select Yes to print the envelope, the Print
dialog box appears.
We’re Off to See the Mail Merge Wizard
Now that you’ve created a document template — or edited one of the existing
ACT! templates — you’re ready to fill in your template with contact informa-
tion. ACT! provides you with the Mail Merge Wizard to take the guesswork
out of this procedure. When you create a mail merge to one or more contacts,
follow these four basic steps:
1. Select the contacts to whom you’re sending the letter.
2. Select the template that includes both the contact fields that you want
to merge into the letter and the body of the letter itself.
3. Choose to send the output to your word processor, printer, fax machine,
or e-mail program.
4. Perform the mail merge.

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Luckily, ACT! takes the laborious task of mail merging and simplifies it via the
Mail Merge Wizard. Throughout the process, you encounter just a few easy-
to-navigate windows. Trust me — there’s no chance of losing your way
because ACT! holds your hand during the entire journey.
To perform a mail merge, follow these steps:
1. Select the contacts to be the recipients of your mail merge.
To do so, either use a lookup to select certain contacts (such as all con-
tacts in a specific state, city, or company) or select contacts from the
Contact List.
If you’re creating one of those charming Christmas newsletters telling all
about your two kids who just graduated from Harvard Medical School
and your recent month-long excursion to purchase two Mercedes —
leave me off the list!
2. From any ACT! view, choose Write➪Mail Merge.
ACT! acts a bit theatrical here, what with all the talk about wizards and
all. The Mail Merge Wizard opens with a screen that announces that you
are starting the Mail Merge Wizard. Like the coming attractions, you can
skip the first screen (just click Next) to go directly to the second wizard
screen.
3. Decide how you want to send the merge.
Decisions, decisions! The four choices on today’s menu are
• Word Processor saves all the merged documents into a single
word processor document. This choice is good if you want to
review your merged documents before printing them.
• E-mail sends all the merged documents as e-mail messages.
If you choose to send out a mail merge via e-mail, each recipient
receives an e-mail specifically addressed to that person. No one
sees a list of the other recipients.
• Printer is a good choice if you’re sure that your contact informa-
tion and that your template is perfect, as in error-free. This choice
is also popular if you like to chop down trees in the Amazon. This
option sends all the merged documents directly to the printer.
• Fax sends all the merged documents as fax transmissions. If this
option is grayed out, you don’t have ACT!-compatible fax software
installed on your computer.
4. Pick your template and click Next.
Indicate the template to use in your mail merge by clicking the Browse
button and selecting the name of the document template that you want
to use.
173
Chapter 11: Merging Your Information into a Document

The Mail Merge Wizard continues and demands to know, in a loud boom-
ing voice, what contacts you want. All right, you caught me in one of my
Judy Garland flashbacks. You can’t actually hear the question, but it
comes across loud and clear in Step 4 of the Mail Merge Wizard, as
shown in Figure 11-3.
5. Choose to whom you want to send the mail merge and then click Next:
• Current Lookup merges your document with the contact records
that you choose in Step 1.
• Current Contact sends the merge only to the contact currently
showing in the Contact Detail window.
• All Contacts goes to everyone in your database.
• Selected Group enables you to merge your document with a spe-
cific contact group.
• Selected Company enables you to merge your document with all
the associates of a given company.
Depending on the send choice you pick in Step 3, you’re pretty close to
the finish line. You can just click Finish in the recap screen that appears.
• If you chose the word processor option, you can now spend the next
two hours reviewing 1,001 personalized letters to your dearest
friends and relatives, ensuring that all the information therein is
accurate.
• If you chose the printer option, you hear the happy sound of your
printer spitting out 1,001 personalized letters to your dearest
friends and relatives.

• If you chose the fax option, your faxing software opens, and you’re
ready to fax.
6. You have a little more work ahead of you if you chose the e-mail option.
Try not to be discouraged. Your e-mails are going to arrive at their
intended destination long before those people choosing one of the other
options even finish stuffing envelopes or decipher the new area code
rules for a fax transmittal. Besides, you’re treated to the options that
you see in Figure 11-4.
• Type the subject line of your e-mail.
• Create a history of your e-mail by including the subject or the sub-
ject and message of your e-mail on the History tab. You also have
the options of attaching the entire e-mail message to a history or
simply creating no history at all.
• Send an attachment along with your e-mail.
• Specify that each recipient of your e-mail send you back a Return
Receipt.
7. Click Next to continue and set your options for the contacts who have
missing e-mail addresses.
I hope you feel appropriately ashamed by the fact that you made ACT!
work so hard while you simply sit back. ACT! now patiently asks you
one final question regarding your e-mail addresses. As you can see in
Figure 11-5, you have several choices as to how to handle the MIAs.
8. After you choose all your options, click Finish.

Chapter 12
ACT! E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Choosing your e-mail preferences
 Working with your contacts’ e-mail addresses
 Sending e-mail
I
n this chapter, I show you how to integrate ACT! with your existing e-mail
client. ACT! enables you to send e-mail through it to an individual contact
in your database, to a selected group of contacts in your database, and to
people who are not in your database. You also discover the various prefer-
ence settings that are crucial in order to e-mail successfully.
Getting Started with ACT! E-Mail
To fully understand the e-mail portion of ACT!, you must understand the con-
cept of the e-mail client. An e-mail client is an application that runs on a per-
sonal computer or workstation and enables you to send, receive, and organize
e-mail. A senior executive at SAGE Software once told me, “ACT! is not in the
business of designing e-mail clients.” What that means is that ACT! isn’t built to
replace your existing e-mail client; rather, ACT! works on top of it. It also means
that if you really want to send out a lot of e-mail using ACT!, you probably want
to investigate one of the add-on products that I mention in Chapter 24.
As of this writing, ACT! 2006 supports the following e-mail clients:
 Internet Mail (an internal stand-alone e-mail client that supports the use
of your SMTP and POP3 settings)
 Outlook
 Outlook Express
 Eudora
 Lotus Notes

For years, ACT! users could not use America Online (AOL) as their e-mail
client if they wanted to integrate with ACT!. Programs such as Yahoo!,
Hotmail, and AOL use the IMAP protocol. ACT!, like most e-mail clients,
requires the SMTP/POP protocol favored by most Internet service providers
(ISPs). (Don’t sweat all the acronyms; just stick with me here.) However, I
know a work-around for those of you who can’t — or won’t — give up your
AOL. Outlook lets you configure an IMAP e-mail account. When prompted, set
the Incoming mail server (IMAP) to imap.aol.com and the Outgoing mail
server (SMTP) to smtp.aol.com.
The two most commonly used e-mail clients are Outlook and Outlook Express
in the Windows environment. For business purposes, Outlook is probably the
e-mail client of choice. With more features than Outlook Express, it’s more
attuned to the business environment. Outlook comes bundled with most ver-
sions of Microsoft Office and is a common fixture on most office computers.
Outlook Express comes as part of the Windows operating system. Because
it’s a much more basic program, Outlook Express isn’t as often used for busi-
ness e-mailing.
Setting Your E-Mail Preferences
If you initially set up your database using the Getting Started Wizard (see
Chapter 3, where I show you how to work your way through the wizard), you
already specified your e-mail client. If you’re working on an existing database,
here’s what you must do to configure ACT! for e-mail:
1. Test to make sure that your e-mail is functioning correctly outside
of ACT!.
Before you configure your e-mail preferences in ACT!, I recommend test-
ing your e-mail to make sure that it’s working correctly. Send a test
e-mail to your significant other using Outlook or Outlook Express. Doing
so helps eliminate problems if you have trouble e-mailing in ACT! for
some reason.
2. Choose Tools➪Preferences and then click the E-Mail tab.
The E-mail Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
3. On the E-Mail tab, click the Composing Options button.
The Composing Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-2,
where you set preferences for your ACT! e-mail.
178

4. Choose from the following options:
• Send E-Mails In: Lets you select HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) or plain text for the default format type of new messages.
• Default Priority: Allows you to select a Low, Normal, or High prior-
ity as the default preference for all your new e-mail.
• History Options: Allows you to select the history type that’s
recorded after you send an e-mail. You can choose to have nothing,
only the subject, the subject and full body, or an attached copy of
your message recorded on the History tab.

Chapter 12: ACT! E-Mail

• Request Return Receipt: Prompts the recipient of your message to
automatically send a notification when he or she receives your
e-mail.
• Close Original E-Mail on Reply or Forward: Closes the original mes-
sage window when replying to or forwarding e-mail.
• Include E-Mail Body on Reply or Forward: Instructs ACT! to include
the original message text when you reply to or forward a message.
• Include Attachments on Reply: Instructs ACT! to include the
original attachment when you reply to a message that includes
an attachment.
• Include Attachments on Forward: Same as the preceding bullet,
except that this option applies to messages with attachments that
you forward.
• Use Auto-Fill to Suggest Names By: Instructs ACT! to automatically
complete the rest of a recipient’s name after you type the first sev-
eral letters of it. You can choose to base this automatic completion
on a first name, last name, company, or e-mail address basis.
• E-Mail Addressing and Name Resolution: Determines whether you
want the auto-fill to search through the contact database (ACT!)
and/or the e-mail system database (Outlook or Outlook Express) to
find recipient names. You can also indicate which database you
like to have ACT! search through first.
5. Click the Signatures button.
The E-Mail Signatures dialog box pops open. Here you type your signa-
ture and any other information that you want to appear in your new
e-mail messages.
If you want to include a hyperlink to your Web site or email address or if
you want to include some sort of a graphic in your signature, create that
HTML code in a program such as FrontPage and paste the code into the
E-Mail Signatures dialog box.
6. Click OK when you finish setting your signature preferences.
The signature appears every time that you originate a brand-new e-mail
from the ACT! E-mail window to a contact or contacts. When you click
the contact’s e-mail address or choose Write➪E-mail Message, ACT!
automatically uses the emailbody.adt template discussed in Chapter
11 rather than the signature that you just created.
7. After you set all your Composing Options preferences, click OK.
The Preferences dialog box reappears.
8. Click the E-mail System Setup button.
The E-mail Setup Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 12-3.

• Internet Mail: If you select Internet Mail, you have a bit of work to
do, as you can see in Figure 12-4. You’re prompted to fill in several
screens full of information including your user name, e-mail
address, password, and the SMTP and POP3 assigned to you by
your e-mail service provider. (You might also be asked for your
shoe size and blood type.) If you don’t have this information you’ll
have to call your ISP to get it.
• Outlook: If you select Outlook, you’re asked whether you want to
use your default Outlook settings and to choose from the signatures
that you composed in Steps 5 and 6.

Chapter 12: ACT! E-Mail

E-Mailing Your Contacts
A benefit of sending e-mail from within ACT! is that a history of the event is
added to your contact’s History tab each and every time that you send an
e-mail. E-mail is an increasingly popular form of communication, so having a
history of all the e-mail that you send to each of your contacts helps you
keep track of it all. You can send e-mail messages to one or more contacts
and attach contact records, group records, or files to your messages.
Depending on how you like to reach your contacts, you can send e-mail to
them using ACT! in a variety of ways. You might send a one-time e-mail to an
individual contact, or you might send a form e-mail to either an individual or
a whole group of your contacts. You might also want to send a spur-of-the-
moment message to one contact — or even thousands of your contacts.
Explore the possibilities.
E-mailing an individual contact
To send an e-mail to the current contact, follow these steps:
1. Create a new e-mail message with one of three methods.
Although these three methods all result in a new message (see Figure
12-5), they work in slightly different ways.
• Click in the contact’s E-Mail field. The contact’s name appears in the
To line, and the wording of the emailbody.adt template appears
in the body of the e-mail.
• Choose Write➪E-Mail Message. The contact’s name appears in the
To line, and the wording of the emailbody.adt template appears
in the body of the e-mail.
The emailbody.adt template works exactly like all other ACT!
templates. For a refresher course in template creation, check out
Chapter 11. Because the first two e-mailing methods use a tem-
plate, they can be personalized to automatically include any tidbit
of the contact’s information that you want. My template, for exam-
ple, includes the recipient’s first name in the body of the e-mail.
• Click the E-Mail icon on the Nav bar and then click New. The To line
is blank, and the signature you created appears in the body. This
method does not use the emailbody.adt template.
2. In the Subject field, type a subject.
3. Edit or create the message in the text box.
182
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

4. Feel free to pick an option or two from the New Message toolbars,
depending on how fancy you want to get with your e-mail.
When you create an e-mail in ACT!, two toolbars appear in the New
Message window. If you hover your mouse over the various tools, a
ToolTip appears, explaining the function of each button.
• The top toolbar enables you to send attachments along with your
e-mail. You’re probably already familiar with the concept of file
attachments. ACT! also allows you to send either a single contact
record, a group of contact records, or a company to recipients (if
they’re using ACT!).
• The bottom toolbar enables you to make changes to the text format-
ting exactly as you do in any word processor. Notice also two but-
tons (refer to Figure 12-5) that allow you to insert either a graphic
or a hyperlink into your e-mail message.
If the bottom toolbar is grayed out, you probably set your e-mail prefer-
ence to plain text. Try switching it over to HTML if you want to add a
splash of color to your e-mails — or at least if you want to be able to use
the formatting toolbar!
5. (Optional) Change the default options for Priority, Create History, and
Return Receipt (upper-right).
See Step 4 in the section “Setting Your E-Mail Preferences,” where I
explain these options.
Figure 12-5:

Chapter 12: ACT! E-Mail

6. Click Send.
Off your mail goes. Depending on the Create History option that you
chose, a message appears on the contact’s History tab.
Sending mass e-mails
ACT! makes a distinction between sending e-mail and sending merged e-mail.
Merged e-mails all share the following characteristics:
 When you send a merged e-mail, ACT! relies on a template.
 When you send a merged e-mail, you must include at least one contact
field in your template.
 E-mail merging in ACT! allows each individual contact name to appear
in the To line rather than having to send the mail using the Bcc (blind
carbon copy) field.
Important things to consider when sending a mass e-mail
Before jumping headfirst into the world of mass e-mailing, consider the fol-
lowing important points:
 Test your e-mail preferences. You should test your e-mail preferences
before sending your missive out to thousands of people. If you don’t,
you might find yourself with a thousand e-mails in your outbox that
can’t be sent. Try sending a sample e-mail to a friend or colleague.
 Test your e-mail template. Again, testing your message before sending it
across the universe is always a good idea. Try sending the message to a
co-worker or colleague first. Having correct spelling and punctuation
isn’t a bad idea, either. Make sure the graphics can be viewed correctly
as mentioned in Chapter 11.
 Check with your ISP. Many ISPs have implemented safeguards against
spam. Before you send an e-mail to all the contacts in your database,
call your ISP to find out how many e-mails you can send at a time. If
your ISP limits the number of e-mails you can send at one time, you need
to send your mailings in smaller groups or purchase an add-on product
that sends your e-mail in batches. You can discover more about these
products in Chapter 24.
 Read up on the Can Spam laws. Laws are in place that require your
e-mail to contain various elements, including your correct contact infor-
mation and a way for recipients to opt out should they not want to hear
from you.
184
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Sending non-merged mass e-mails
If you’re not entirely comfortable with the concepts of e-mail blasting, you
might want to start out by sending an e-mail to your contacts rather than
attempting an actual e-mail merge. This way is great for less computer-oriented
ACT! users to reach a large number of contacts.
You can send non-merged e-mail at the spur of the moment because it doesn’t
involve the creation of a template. However, you cannot customize the To or
Subject portions of the e-mail with any of your contact’s specific information.
To send an e-mail to any number of your contacts, here’s all you have to do:
1. Create a lookup (Chapter 6 shows you how) to find the contacts to
whom you want to send the e-mail.
For example, if you want to send an e-mail to all customers in the
Southeastern Region, create the lookup and then narrow it to include
only those contacts that have an e-mail address.
Narrow your lookup by choosing Lookup➪E-Mail Address. Then select
Narrow Lookup for the current lookup and then click Non-empty Fields.
Voilà! Your lookup is narrowed to include only those contacts having an
e-mail address.
2. Click the E-Mail icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
The ACT! E-Mail dialog box opens.
If you set your e-mail preferences to either Outlook or Outlook Express,
you now see a mirror image of either your Outlook or Outlook
Express folders.
3. Click the New icon on the e-mail window’s toolbar.
The New icon is easy to spot — it’s the icon that says New on it!
4. Click the To, Cc, or Bcc button.
The Select Recipients dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-6. Here’s
where you choose multiple contacts who all receive your e-mail blast.
5. In the Address Book drop-down list, select the address book that you
want to use.
You can select to use either the currently opened ACT! database or your
Outlook e-mail addresses.
6. In the Select From drop-down list, choose All Contacts, Current
Lookup, Groups, or Companies.
• All Contacts: Provides you with a list of all your contacts
• Current Lookup: Limits the list of recipients to contacts in your cur-
rent lookup
185
Chapter 12: ACT! E-Mail

• Groups: Displays a list of the groups in your current ACT! database
• Companies: Displays a list of the companies in your database
7. Select one or more names from the list on the left.
• To select a single name, click it.
• To select a contiguous list of names, click the first name in the list,
press Shift, and then click the last name in the list that you want to
select.
• To select multiple (noncontiguous) names in the list, click the first
name that you want to select and then press Ctrl while clicking any
and all names that you want to select.
8. Click the To button.
The names that you select appear in the Message Recipients box.
Unless you want all the recipients of the message to know the names of
everyone else who received your e-mail, click the Bcc button rather than
the To or Cc buttons.
9. Click OK.
You return to the New Message window. The names of all your intended
recipients now appear in the To (or Cc or Bcc) area of your e-mail 
message.
10. If you like, change any of the e-mail options.
Go for it! Insert a link to your Web site or attach a file. You find plenty of
options in the New Message menu.
11. Verify that all your intended recipients have a valid e-mail address.
ACT! automatically checks to ensure that an e-mail address exists for
each of your recipients. If you look at Figure 12-6, you’ll notice that some
Figure 12-6:
Select
recipients
for an e-mail
blast.
186
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

of the names in the Message Recipients field are underlined; those repre-
sent the contacts with valid e-mail addresses. If a name does not have a
valid e-mail address, it’s not underlined. When you send the message,
you’re prompted to add any e-mail addresses that ACT! doesn’t find.
ACT! isn’t perfect — although it comes pretty darned close! The e-mail
checker finds contacts with blank e-mail addresses as well as those
missing key pieces of information, such as the @ character. If you don’t
know someone’s e-mail address, leaving it blank is better than inserting
something cute like N/A that can confuse — or at least slow down — the
checker.
Don’t know whether an e-mail address is correct? Right-click any under-
lined name and choose Properties to sneak a peek at the e-mail address
you have on record for that contact.
12. Click Send.
You might want to pat yourself on the back, content with the knowledge
that you have mastered the art of sending an e-mail blast.
Sending a templated e-mail to a party of one
Using ACT! to create an e-mail merge enables you to send personalized tem-
plates for each recipient. The cool thing about ACT! templates is that you can
use them for either snail mailing or e-mailing. In Chapter 11, I show you how
to produce a mass mailing. The Mail Merge Wizard provides you with the
option to e-mail as well as snail mail.
If you want to send a thank-you e-mail to just one of your contacts and don’t
want to go through the entire wizard again, here’s a few shortcuts.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Write➪Other Document and chose the
template that you want to use for the body of your e-mail.
2. Generate the e-mail message.
• In Word: Choose ACT➪Send E-mail. You have the choice of sending
the template as an attachment or as the body of the e-mail. After
you make your selection, select the name of your recipient and
click OK.
• In the ACT! word processor: Choose File➪Send➪E-mail.
Figure 12-7 shows how the message was personalized to include both the
contact’s name and pertinent information.
Mail merge must include at least one mail merge field. If you aren’t personal-
izing your e-mails, you need to choose a different method of e-mailing. Also
keep in mind that you’ll probably want to create a lookup of the contacts you
want to e-mail before starting the e-mail merge so that your e-mail will reach
the correct recipients!
187
Chapter 12: ACT! E-Mail

Editing e-mail addresses
The one critical ingredient of sending an e-mail is having an e-mail address.
No doubt you’ve already added many e-mail addresses to your ACT! data-
base, but I’m guessing that you haven’t yet discovered a good way to correct
or change existing e-mail addresses.
ACT! is designed to launch the e-mail window when you click the E-Mail field
in the Contact Detail window. This feature allows you to easily send e-mail in
ACT! but makes editing existing addresses difficult.
To edit an E-Mail address, try one of these methods:
 Use the Tab key to move the cursor to the E-Mail field. After the cursor
is in an E-Mail field, you can edit it by clicking the E-Mail field’s drop-
down arrow.
 Move the mouse pointer over the E-Mail field and right-click. You can
now edit the E-Mail field.
 Hold the cursor over the E-mail field and wait a few seconds; the cursor
changes from a hand to a vertical line.

Working with Incoming E-Mail
When you’re proficient at sending e-mail, you need to know how to read an
e-mail message. Although you can continue to view your mail using your
existing mail client, you want to familiarize yourself with the ACT! e-mail
client. After you open up ACT!’s e-mail by clicking the E-mail icon on the
Navigation bar, you might want to perform one of the following tasks:
 Open a message. Double-clicking the message does the trick.
 Read messages in another folder. Simply click the folder in the
Folder List.
 Sort your e-mail messages. You can change the order by clicking any
column header.
 Create a new contact record from an incoming e-mail (if the contact
isn’t already in your database). Right-click the message and choose
Create Contact From Sender.
This is a particularly timesaving feature of ACT! and ensures that poten-
tial contacts don’t get lost in the shuffle.
 Attach the e-mail to a contact’s History tab. Just like you can create an
automatic history record each time that you send an e-mail to a contact,
you can also create a history each time that you receive an e-mail from a
contact.
a. Choose Actions➪Attach➪Attach to Contact.
b. On the Attach E-mail to Contact dialog box that appears, click the
name of the contact(s) to associate with the e-mail message.
c. Click the To button and then click OK.
ACT! places a note on the contact’s History tab indicating that you
received an e-mail from the contact.
 Schedule a follow-up. Right-click the message and choose Create
Activity from Message.
You can now schedule a follow-up; the subject of the e-mail automati-

Advanced ACT!ing

In this part . . .
O
n the surface, ACT! is a deceptively easy program to
master. However, those of you who are so inclined —
or didn’t run fast enough — might want to add ACT! data-
base Administrator to your current job description. The
database Administrator is in charge of adding new fields
to the database and making sure that they are artistically
placed onto your layout. Need to take your database with
you? You’ll be able to synchronize your database with a
little help from this section. Best of all, when things go
wrong, guess whom everyone will turn to? Not to worry,
though — just turn to this section for help.

Chapter 13
Creating Contact Fields
In This Chapter
 Understanding the field concept
 Thinking before adding fields
 Adding a custom field
 Managing the ACT! lists
I
am a firm believer that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Although
adding a field to your ACT! database is not a hard thing to do, it is some-
thing that should be well thought out and planned in advance. This is particu-
larly true if you plan on sharing your database with other users. Planning is
important because you usually have a goal in mind for your database. If your
goal is to create a report with three columns — one for the contact name, one
for the birthday, and one for the Social Security number — you need to make
sure that all those fields exist in your database. Planning also prevents you
from adding thousands of contacts to your database, only to find you have
to modify each record to include information that was omitted the first time
around!
To add a field to your database, you must be a Database Manager or
Administrator; the makers of ACT! made this a requirement so that you
understand the importance of this responsibility. So unless you have 
administrative rights to the database, you don’t even have to read this 
chapter! I suppose you still could, just for curiosity’s sake, but it isn’t necessary.
In this chapter, I show you (all of you who have Administrator- or Manager-
level rights to your databases anyway) not only how to add new fields to an
ACT! database but also how to set the various field parameters to help users
use the database more effectively and efficiently.
Before getting started, I want to briefly outline the three steps involved with
adding fields to a database:
1. Understand why you want to add fields and what purpose these fields
will serve.
2. Determine what fields you’re going to add and what drop-down lists will
be available in each.

I can’t stress enough the importance of this step. Plan ahead! Or you
might end up with a big mess. . . .
3. Add the fields.
And, voilà! You’re done. (Okay, this one has a whole bunch of steps, but
you get what I mean.)
Understanding the Concept of Fields
For most of you, adding a field to your database will be easy. After all, you’re
good at following directions. However, for some of you, knowing why to enter
a field can prove to be more challenging.
To explore the question of why, I first want to reiterate the basic concept of
fields. What the heck is a field? A field is a single piece of information. In gen-
eral, a field contains just one piece of information. For example, you have
only one business ZIP code; therefore, you have one business Zip Code field.
Alternatively, you probably have several phone numbers: home, business,
toll-free, cellular, fax, beeper . . . and the list goes on. Each of these phone
numbers requires a separate field.
A good field holds one fairly specific piece of information. A bad field con-
tains too much information. For example, having a separate field for your
street address, city, state, and ZIP code is a good thing. These separate fields
allow you to perform a lookup based on any of the criteria: You could find
clients by ZIP code, city, or state. An example of a bad field is lumping all the
address information into a single field; in this example, you’d then lose your
ability to perform a lookup by ZIP code, city, or state. (Need a refresher on
performing lookups? Head to Chapter 6.)
Consider the following basic rules when determining the criteria for adding a
field to your database:
 A field contains an important tidbit of information.
 A field can be used to perform a query or sort. For example, you might
want to send a mailing to all your customers in New York and sort your
mailing by ZIP code. To do this sort, you need separate fields for contact
type, state, and ZIP code.
 A field can be used to insert information into a report or template. If
you want to create letters thanking one person for buying a purple polka
dot vase and another for buying a leopard-print vase, you need a vase
type field.
194
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Do Your Homework!
Okay, I admit it — I’m a former secondary school teacher, and I guess that
background just naturally spills over into my ACT! consulting. Well class,
pretend you’re back in school because you’re going to be assigned some
homework. To be politically correct, I could have said you’re now entering
the pre-planning stage of your ACT! implementation. But I still consider it
important homework that you must complete prior to jumping in and adding
new fields to your database, so your assignment is as follows:
1. Jot down all the fields that you want to see in your database.
Most of the fields you want to see such as company, name, phone
number, and address are already included in ACT!. What you need to
decide here is what fields, if any, are specific to your business.
2. Scurry around the office and collect any documents that you want
ACT! to create for you. This includes both forms and form letters.
You’re going to have to get a little high-tech here, but I think you can
handle it. Get out your trusty highlighter and highlight any of the infor-
mation in each document that is contact specific. For example, each con-
tact has its own unique address. Maybe you’re thanking particular
contacts to meet to discuss purchasing widgets (as opposed to gadgets,
which you also sell). This means that you need a Product field.
3. Think how to populate the fields with drop-down lists. Then, on the
list that you started in Step 1, jot them down to the side of each of the
fields.
For example, if you run a modeling agency, you might need a field for
hair color. The drop-down choices could contain red, blonde, black, and
punk pink.
4. Sketch out any reports that you want to create from ACT! and add the
column headings to the now rather long list that you created in Step 1.
The idea here is to get your thoughts down on paper so that you can
visualize how you want your ACT! report to look. If you already have a
sample of your report in Excel, you can use that. If not, get out your
trusty pencil and outline on a piece of paper what you like your report
to actually look like.
5. Get out a red pen. At the top of your paper, write 100% and Well Done
and then draw a smiley face. Hang your list on your refrigerator.
Okay, that last step isn’t really necessary, but now you’re well on your
way to having the database of your dreams!
195
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

Dust off your thinking cap as you create your list. Sometimes one field will
do the job, and other times you might need multiple fields. For example, sup-
pose you sell widgets that are red, white, or blue. In one scenario, a customer
needs to buy only one widget; in this case, you create a product field with
three choices in the drop-down list — red, white, or blue. Or perhaps you
manufacture a different kind of widget; in this case, a customer would hope-
fully buy one of each color. This time, your purposes would be better served
by creating three fields — one for each type of widget.
Adding a New Field to Your Database
Believe it or not, after completing your homework (see the preceding sec-
tion), you’re done with the hard part of the task. The actual addition of fields
is relatively easy; just follow the steps.
Only an ACT! user with Administrator or Manager privileges can add new
fields to an ACT! database. If the Define Fields option is grayed out in Step 1,
you aren’t logged in as one.
1. In any ACT! view, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
The Contact Detail window is generally a good place to start for most of
your customization projects. The Define Fields dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 13-1. The View Fields For drop-down list indicates that
you’re editing or adding new contact fields to the database. You can also
add new group, company, and opportunity fields to your database by
switching the View Fields For list to the appropriate choice.
Figure 13-1:
The Define
Fields
dialog box.
196
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

ACT! does not allow you to add new fields or edit existing fields while
other users are logged on to the database. If you see the warning shown in
Figure 13-2, you know that other users are indeed currently logged on to
the database. What to do? Storm over to their workstations in a huff and
demand that they exit out of ACT! immediately. If that doesn’t work, con-
sider bribery. Conversely, as long as you are editing fields, other users
cannot access the database. If you look in ACT!’s title bar, you even notice
that (Locked) now appears. To avoid frustration on everyone’s part, you
might want to explain this concept to the users of your database.
2. Start by renaming one of the 10 user fields. You find all your fields
listed alphabetically by field name. Select one of them.
This is where you need to drag your homework off the refrigerator and
type in one of the fields that you had planned to create in the Field Name
box. ACT! supplies you with ten user fields that you can customize to
better serve the needs of your business. After all, Social Security Number
is a lot more meaningful than User 2.
3. Click the Edit Field option in the Field Tasks section.
You’re rewarded with a friendly looking window that looks exactly like
the one shown in Figure 13-3.
When you run out of user fields to rename, feel free to click the Create
New Field option in the Field Tasks section.
ACT! rewards you with a blank, new field in the Field Name box and
assigns it the name New Field until you can think of something better to
call it. At that point, the following steps are identical to the steps you
follow for editing a field.
Figure 13-2:
Another

the

197
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

4. Type a field name.
Try not to get too fancy or long-winded when naming your fields. Using
special characters such as <, >, $, or : can cause problems when creating
queries and mail merges, so I recommend that you not use them. You
can use spaces in the field name, but don’t end a field name with a
space. And because long field names can be hard to place into mail
merge templates and layouts, you’re better off keeping field names as
short as possible.
5. From the Select a Field Data Type to Convert To drop-down menu (refer
to Figure 13-3), choose a field type for the field that you’re adding.
You can create a variety of different types of fields. Actually, there are 18
different field types, but who’s counting? If you’re renaming one of the
user fields, your choices include:
• Character: This is probably the most common of the field type
choices; a character field can contain both numbers and charac-
ters. It’s kind of a one-size-fits-all kind of field.
• Currency: As its name implies, this is for fields relating to cold, hard
cash. The field comes equipped with a dollar sign, appropriate
commas, optional decimal places, and a sunroof (optional).
• Decimal: This field accepts only numbers, a decimal point, and
more numbers.
• Initial-Caps: At first glance, this seems like a nifty option. The
idea behind the Initial Capitals option is that you can turn KAREN
FREDRICKS into Karen Fredricks. Seems like a great idea on paper.
In reality, however, you end up with Ibm Corporation and Marcus
Welby Md.
• Lowercase: i suppose you might want to type in all lowercase. i just
can’t imagine why.
Figure 13-3:
Defining an
ACT! field.
198
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

• Memo: This is where you can store a large amount of information
that you don’t want to risk burying away amidst your other notes.
For example, you might want to include your driving directions in
this area.
• Number: This option enables you to enter only numbers into a
field. Say you want to find all your customers that have more than
30 employees. You can easily search for a number greater than 30,
whereas you can’t possibly search for a number greater than thirty.
• Upper Case: I NEVER TYPE IN ALL UPPERCASE BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I’M SCREAMING. BESIDES, I’M AFRAID I MIGHT DEVELOP
POLYPS ON MY FINGERTIPS.
• URL Address: Use this field type if you need to associate another
Web address with your contacts.
ACT! already comes equipped with e-mail and Web site fields for
your viewing pleasure. And, you can add several additional e-mail
addresses to the existing ACT! E-mail field. 
If you’re creating a brand-new, field ACT! gives you all of the choices on
the menu above plus a couple of brand-new ones:
• Address: Talk about a timesaver! When you designate a field as an
address field, ACT! automatically creates seven fields: three for the
street address, and another four for the city, state, ZIP, and country.
• Annual Event: Like it or not, some events take place once a year.
Use this field to find birthdays, anniversaries, and yearly renewals
regardless of the year.
• Date: A really cool thing happens when you make a field a Date field.
When the time comes for you to enter information into a Date field,
you see a tiny little calendar that enables you to select a date. The
calendar is cute, but more importantly, it supplies a useful purpose.
If you create a field for a birthday and make it a Character field, the
other local yokels using the database might get creative and input
anything from Jan 1 and January 1st to 01/01 and 1/1. Finding all birth
dates in the month of January would become an exercise in futility.
• Date/Time: When you want to be really exacting, create a
Date/Time field to record the exact date and time of an event.
• E-mail: It used to be that everyone you know had several phone
numbers. Now, the chances are pretty good that your contacts
have numerous e-mail addresses. Here’s your opportunity to
include as many as you like.
• Phone: In Chapter 4, I show you all those nifty things that ACT! does
to speed up the data input process. If you designate a field to be a
Phone field, you automatically get a year’s supply of dashes.
199
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

• Picture: A picture is worth a thousand words, and here’s where you
can stick a picture of each client or a picture of each product that
they bought.
• Time: If time is of the essence, this is where you can input a time.
• Yes/No: This actually creates a check box field that you can mark.
Call me old-fashioned, but I think Check Box would have been a
more appropriate name. To further confuse the issue, a query on
this field looks for True or False values.
6. Assign any of the five optional attributes for the field being added and
click Next. Feel free to choose several attributes if you wish.
Depending on the field type you select, all these features might not be
available. For example, if you choose the Date field with the cute little
calendar, you won’t have the drop-down list option.
• Allow Editing: This enables any of your users to add new data to a
field.
• Allow Blank: If you want to require that a field must be filled in, you
need to remove the check mark from this field. Use this option if
you want to require a user to enter information into a certain field.
• Generate History: This neat little feature generates a history on the
History tab when you change the contents of the field.
• Primary Field: When you duplicate a contact record, the primary
fields are the fields that are duplicated.
• Use Drop-Down List: When you choose this feature, you can either
pick an existing drop-down list or create a new, unique drop-down
list. I cover creating drop-down lists later in this chapter in the
“Creating a drop-down list field” section.
7. Customize your field further by choosing from the following optional
selections and then click Next.
The next Define Fields screen — Customize field behavior — opens,
offering you a few more choices for your editing pleasure.
• Default Value: If 80 percent of your database consists of customers,
you might assign Customer as the default value of the ID/Status field.
• Field Format: If you want dashes or another symbol to appear auto-
matically in a field, here’s the place to do it by inserting the symbol
where you want data to go. For example, a Social Security number
looks like ###-##-####.
• Field Length: You might want to limit the number of characters that
a user can enter into a given field; for example, you can limit a field
looking for values of Yes or No to three characters.
200
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Trim the field length whenever possible. If the longest value in a field is
Yes and the field length is 75, you’ve created a lot of dead space. Cutting
down the field length helps reduce the size of your database — and ulti-
mately increases performance.
8. Set optional triggers.
Adding a trigger to a field causes something magical to happen when
entering data into a field. For example, you might want an Excel spread-
sheet to open when you move your cursor into the field, and an activity
series to start when you leave the field. In Figure 13-4, you see three
ways to start a trigger: when changing a field, when entering a field, and
when leaving a field.
For each type of trigger, you can assign one of three possibilities:
• None: If you want nothing to occur, choose this option.
• Program: Clicking the Browse button allows you to navigate to vir-
tually any file in your computer. You can browse to a program, a
URL, or even to a specific file.
• Activity Series: Clicking the Browse button takes you to a list of the
activity series that you created. If you haven’t created any activity
series, pay a visit to Chapter 8 to find out how.
9. Click Finish.
Many of the neat add-on products that complement ACT! are designed as
field triggers; when you purchase the add-on, you might need to link the
product to a specific field. Check my Web site at www.techbenders.com/
act4dummies.htm to find out more about some of these special trigger
products.

Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

Working with Lists
The sure-fire way to destroy a database is by adding information in an inconsis-
tent manner. Drop-down lists help ensure that users input data in a uniform
way. As an extra, added bonus, drop-down lists also save you time; when you
type in the first several letters of an item in your drop-down list, ACT! responds
by completing the word for you.
In ACT!, you find three major list types. Two of them, the Product List and
the Process List, are associated with your Opportunities. The other list type,
Drop-Down, is associated with your contact, group, company, and opportunity
fields. Although you can add new items to a list as you are using it, managing
your lists in one central location — the edit fields area — is easier.
Creating a drop-down list field
Associating a drop-down list with a field requires two things:
 Specifying that the field is to contain a drop-down list
 Adding items to the drop-down list
Although which one comes first doesn’t matter — the field or the drop-down
list — I start by creating the field that is to contain a drop-down list:
1. From any ACT! window, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
The Define Fields dialog box opens in all its glory (refer to Figure 13-1).
You might even notice three items in the List Tasks area. Hold that
thought — I discuss those in the next section.
2. Click the field name that you want to contain a drop-down list and
then click the Edit Field option in the Field Tasks area.
The first of the Define Fields dialog windows open.
3. Select the Use Drop-Down List check box.
If you want to use an existing drop-down list, here’s your golden oppor-
tunity. For example, the last time I checked, there were 50 U.S. states;
those states are the same for my mailing, business, and home addresses.
You could have one State drop-down list and associate it with the mail-
ing, business, and home state fields.
4. Click Finish.
202
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Whew! That was pretty easy. If you’re using an existing drop-down list, you’re
finished. However, if you need to build a drop-down list from scratch, you
have more work. Fortunately, ACT! returns you to the Define Fields dialog
box, which is right where you need to be to create or edit a drop-down list.
Creating a drop-down list
This might seem like a case of “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” In
the previous section, I tell you how to associate a field with an already cre-
ated drop-down list. For example, if you create a mailing list address, you can
use the existing State drop-down list to avoid having to type in all the states
into a new drop-down list. In other cases, you need to go back and create the
drop-down list. Here’s what you need to do:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields (refer to
Figure 13-1).
If you just created the drop-down field, you can skip this step because
you’re already there!
2. Select Manage Drop-Down Lists from the List Tasks area.
The Create, Edit, or Delete Drop-Down Lists window appears.
• To create a drop-down list: Click Create Drop-Down List from the
Drop-Down List Tasks area.
• To edit a drop-down list: Select the drop-down list and then click
Edit Drop-Down List from the Drop-Down List Tasks area.
The Enter Drop-Down List Name and Type window opens, as shown in
Figure 13-5.
Figure 13-5:
Configuring
a drop-
down list.
203
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

3. Configure the following drop-down list options and then click Next:
• Drop-Down List Name: To make things less complicated for your-
self, use a name that very closely resembles the name of the field
that will be associated with the drop-down list.
• Type: Choose what type of field goes in the list — for example,
character.
• Description: If you have a lot of drop-down lists, you might need to
give your list a bit of further explanation.
• Allow Users to Edit Items in This List: Users have the ability to edit
the drop-down list while they enter contact information.
• Automatically Add New Items Users Enter to the List: This lets your
users define the items that will be used in a drop-down list by auto-
matically adding each item they enter into the drop-down list.
Be very cautious about including those last two options. Allowing users
to edit items in the drop-down list can carve away at the standardization
that you’ve strived so hard to maintain. If you decide to allow users to
automatically add new items to a drop-down list, you might want to do
so only temporarily. Although this option is a great way to build a drop-
down list from scratch, you run the chance of creating a mess. Make
sure that all users have a good idea of the kind of items that should —
and shouldn’t — be added to the drop-down lists. And, more impor-
tantly, make sure they peruse the existing entries in the drop-down list
before adding new items to avoid duplication.
4. From the Enter Drop-Down List Values window, choose one of the fol-
lowing options:
• Add: When you click the Add button, your cursor jumps down to
the bottom of your list of drop-down items. Type in the new drop-
down item and an optional description, and you’re all set.
• Delete: This permanently removes the selected item from the drop-
down list. However, previously entered information based on the
removed drop-down item still remains in your database.
5. Type in the drop-down list item and an optional description.
Chances are that you don’t need to include descriptions in your drop-
down list. Once in a while, though, they can prove to be priceless. The
State drop-down list consists of the two letter state abbreviations; the
description includes the full name of the state for those of us who can
never remember whether MA stands for Maine, Maryland, or
Massachusetts! You can see what I mean in Figure 13-6.
6. Click Finish when you finish adding all the items you want to your
drop-down list.
204
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Managing the Product List
In Chapter 19, you can find almost everything you need to know about the
exciting world of Opportunities — and believe me, there are a bunch of cool
things. However, in this chapter, you discover how to modify your opportu-
nity fields — and the drop-down lists associated with them. You’ll also find
out how to input a list of the products or services that you routinely sell to
your customers or clients.
Don’t think that because your company doesn’t sell widgets — or some simi-
lar item — that you can’t use the Product List. Perhaps a better name for this
field would have been Products/Services. At any rate, if you are gaining finan-
cially from your customers, use the Product List to help you analyze your
profit centers.
To modify your Product List, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields (refer to
Figure 13-1).
The Define Fields window opens.
2. Click Manage Product List.
The Manage Product List dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-7.
3. Click the Add button.
A New Product item appears at the bottom of the list of your product
names.
Figure 13-6:
Adding

205
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

4. Fill in the appropriate fields.
You can move through the various fields by pressing Tab.
a. Assign a name to your product.
b. Enter an item number if you use them.
c. Add the cost that you pay for the item if applicable.
d. Include the price you’re going to charge your customers for the item if
you adhere to a set price structure.
If your costs and prices fluctuate, feel free to leave those fields blank. You
can always change them each time you enter a new sales opportunity.
5. Click OK to close the Manage Product List dialog box and then click
Close to close the Define Fields window.
Managing the Process List
The ACT! program was originally developed as a sales tool for busy sales
people. Today, the product has evolved to the point that just about any
industry and individual can benefit by using ACT!. However, the tradition of
sales tracking remains, and the Process List is just one of those examples.
ACT!’s Process List allows you to set up the steps that everyone in your orga-
nization follows when trying to close a sale. You can even associate a proba-
bility with each step. It is rumored that you need to contact someone 12
times before you convert them from a prospect to a customer; here’s where
you can be reminded of where you are in that process.
Figure 13-7:
Editing the
Product List.
206
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

To edit or create a Process List, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields➪Manage Process
List.
The Create, Edit, or Delete Opportunity Processes dialog box, as shown in
Figure 13-8, appears. If you already set up a Process List, you see it listed
by name, description, and the current stage number in the Process List.
2. Select one of the following three options and click Next:
• Create New Opportunity Process: Creates a brand-spanking new
Process List.
• Edit Opportunity Process: Allows you to edit an existing Process List.
• Delete Opportunity Process: Deletes an existing Process List. Rather
than deleting an existing list, you might decide to make it inactive.
You see that option on the next screen.
3. Double-click a name, description, or probability to change it.
If you’re editing an existing Process List, modifying an entry by double-
clicking is easy. The steps from the previously created Process List
appear, as shown in Figure 13-9. If you’re creating a new Process List,
your processes are empty. Don’t worry though — you can fill them up
easily enough.
4. Click the Add or Delete button to further configure your Process List.
The stages are numbered. ACT! automatically numbers the stages in a
Process List, saving you the effort. If you want, you can change the order
by choosing one of the options to move an option either up or down on
the list. When you move an option, all subsequent stages automatically
renumber.
5. Click Finish when you’re done.
Figure 13-8:
Creating

207
Chapter 13: Creating Contact Fields

In ACT!, you can often skin a cat or solve a problem in more than one way.
You can access the Product and Process lists from two other areas of ACT!:
 From any ACT! screen, choose Contacts➪Opportunities➪Manage Product
(or Process) List.
 Scroll down to the bottom of the Product or Process List when creating
a new — or editing an existing — opportunity. From there, you can
select Edit List.
A Few More Customization Options
Managers and Administrators have all the fun when it comes to ACT! because
they can customize a database to their heart’s content. In this section, I point
out a few commonly overlooked areas that can be customized.
Adding custom activity types
Out of the box, ACT! gives you five activity types: call, meeting, to-do, personal
activity, and vacation. You can modify this list of activity types by creating a
custom activity type. To add a custom activity type, just follow the bouncing
ball:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Types.
The Manage Activity Types dialog box appears, which bears a striking
resemblance to Figure 13-10.
Figure 13-9:
Customizing
the stages

208
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. Click Add.
The Add Activity Type dialog box appears, as seen in Figure 13-11.
a. Type the name for the activity type in the Name field.
b. Select the Active - Allow New Activities of This Type check box if you
want to allow users to schedule activities of this type.
3. Create the result options to use when the task is completed.
Every ACT! activity has results associated with it. These result choices
appear when you clear an activity; once you clear the activity the result
you selected is automatically entered into the history tab of the contact
associated with the activity. When you create an activity type, two types
of results are automatically assigned to it: Completed and Not Completed.

Although you cannot delete these two options, you can edit them. You can
also add new result types. When you add a new result type, it becomes
available as an option when you clear an activity.
• To add a new result type: Click the Add button.
• To edit a result type: Click the Edit button.
4. Click OK in the Add Activity Type dialog box.
The activity type appears in the Activity Types list the very next time
you schedule an activity.
Don’t ask me why, but for some unknown reason, you can’t delete an activity
type after you create it. However, you can edit the activity type and even
change the name of the activity type. Go figure!
Editing priority types
If there is a square inch of ACT! that can’t be customized, I haven’t found it
yet. Even the priorities you use when scheduling activities can be tweaked.
ACT! includes five basic priority types: High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-
Low, and Low. However, only three of the priority types (High, Medium and
Low) are active. A priority must have Active status in order for it to appear
when you schedule an activity. And although you can’t add a new priority
type, you can rename an existing one if you so desire.
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose Schedule➪Manage➪Priorities.
The Manage Priorities dialog box opens, as seen in Figure 13-12.
2. Select the priorities you want to activate by selecting the check box in
the Active column.
3. Highlight a priority and then click the Edit button to change the name
of a priority.
4. Click OK when you finish editing the Priority List.

In This Chapter

 Adding new fields to the layout
 Beautifying your layout
M
any ACT! users are confused about the concept of the layout. In fact,
some of you might have ended up renaming a layout label when you
wanted to rename fields. A field is a place to store information. The layout is
how you actually see those fields. Your layout determines both the order of
the fields and the format of each field. A layout is the name for a file that
determines which fields you see and in what order those fields appear. After
you add new fields to your ACT! database, the next step is to stick them into
an existing layout (or design a new one).
The layout confusion is further compounded by users who share their data-
base across a network. Problems occur if the users access different layouts.
Depending on the layout that they use, some users might not be able to see
all the fields of the database.
In this chapter, I show you how to use the Layout Designer to modify an exist-
ing layout. Here you master adding or replacing fields and tabs on your
layout, reordering all the fields when you finish, and finally, adding a few
artistic touches to your masterpiece.
Only database users with the Administrator or Manager level security have
access to the Layout Designer. If you are a Standard, Restricted, or Browse
level user, you get to sit back, put your feet on the desk, and direct the
Administrator or Manager as to how you want to have the layout designed.
Be careful what you wish for, however; if you are an Administrator or
Manager, you get to do all the dirty work, so keep reading!

Modifying an Existing ACT! Layout
Before you begin modifying an existing layout, think about how you want
your fields arranged on your layout. Why not try out all the layouts that
come with ACT!? This way, you can get a feeling for the one that’s most com-
fortable for you. Don’t worry about colors or the names on the tabs — you
can change all that.
Arranging fields the way you want them
Ah, the age-old question of form versus function. This hint might sound like a
no-brainer, but many ACT! users never realize the importance of changing the
field locations in their layout. For example, you might choose a layout that
has the main business phone number on the top portion of your layout, the
home phone number on a different tab along the bottom, and the mobile
phone number in a third location. If you’re constantly flipping between tabs
to find phone numbers, move them together into one strategic place on your
layout. This organization might not make your layout look better, but you’ll
certainly feel better! The point is to design your layout in such a way that
data input becomes easy — and possibly even fun!
Here’s what you do to modify an existing layout in terms of field selection and
placement:
1. Choose the layout that’s closest to the one that you want to have.
If you need help with switching layouts, take a peek at Chapter 2.
2. Choose Tools➪Design Layout➪Contact.
You’re also given a choice of group and company. That’s because you
can also design — or redesign — your group and company layouts in
exactly the same way as you do for your contact layout.
The Layout Designer opens. Each field consists of two elements (see
Figure 14-1):
• The field label, which is an optional element, usually appears
immediately to the left of a field.
• The field itself is identified by the down arrow that appears at the
field’s right edge.
3. Maximize the Layout Designer.
Okay, this step isn’t a necessity, but it sure makes your design chores a
whole lot easier! I’m always amazed when I see someone struggling with
layout on a small portion of the monitor.
212
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

4. Make sure the toolbox and Properties window are both open.
These are two important elements that you need to have open in order
to create or modify a layout. The toolbox sits on the left side of the
Layout Designer, and the Properties window sits on the right side. Feel
free to move them out of your way if you like, but trust me — you’re
going to need them momentarily! (Read more about these features in
Chapter 10.)
If the toolbox and/or the Properties window are nowhere to be seen, try
giving the View menu a click to open them. You see both of them listed
right there; a check mark next to either Toolbox or Properties Window
means they are alive and well — and living on the Layout Designer.
If the Properties window gets in your way on occasion but you don’t
want to keep heading up to the View window every time you want to
open or close it, press F4 to speed up the process.
5. Choose File➪Save As and give your layout a new name.
I recommend saving and naming your new layout with an easily recog-
nizable way. That way you can later go back to your original layout (if
you totally annihilate this one) and easily identify your layout. 
The name of your layout appears in the Layout Designer title bar (refer
to Figure 14-1).
Figure 14-1:
The ACT!
Layout
Designer.
213
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

Save changes to your layout early and often. The Save icon on the
Layout Designer is represented by the standard floppy disk icon. Click it
to save your work. Relying on the old Undo standby (Edit➪Undo) is an
option, but saving your layout early and often is always a good idea!
When you save a contact layout, ACT! automatically assigns it the exten-
sion .cly. When you save a group layout, ACT! gives it the .gly
extension. And when you create a company layout, the file is given
the .aly moniker.
6. Select the Pointer tool in the toolbox.
The Pointer tool, the tool that you’ll probably use most often, enables
you to select fields so that you can move, change, or remove them.
7. With the Pointer tool, select the fields and field labels that you want
to move — or remove — from the layout.
Removing unused fields can simplify a layout and make room for other
fields that you want to add. I recommend removing what’s unwanted
before moving on to other aspects of the layout design process.
Make your selections by any of these methods:
• Click any field or field label to select it.
• Click any field and then press Shift or Ctrl while clicking additional
fields to select multiple fields and labels.
• Create a box around the desired labels and fields by holding down
the left mouse button and then dragging to create a selection box.
When you select a field, a border of small boxes (called handles) appears
around the field indicating that it’s selected. In Figure 14-1, the Company
field is selected.
8. If you want to remove fields, press Delete.
The unwanted fields go away.
Removing a field from the layout doesn’t remove the actual field from
the database. The field remains in your database but isn’t visible in the
layout. See the “Using layouts to restrict access to key fields” sidebar for
more details.
9. To move fields around, select them with the Pointer and then drag
them to a new location on your layout.
If only rearranging the living room were this easy! The idea is to drag
the selected fields and their corresponding labels to the place on your
layout that seems the most logical to you. When you hold your mouse
over selected fields, your cursor transforms into a plus sign, indicating
that you’re ready to move the field.
214
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

If you need to make only a minor adjustment to the field location, you
might try using your keyboard’s arrow keys for really fine-tuning your
layout.
You can move a group of fields by selecting them and then pressing Ctrl+X.
Move your cursor to the new spot on your layout where you want to place
the cells and press Ctrl+V to paste the fields. Voilà! — you move the group of
fields en masse.
Adding new fields to the layout
In Chapter 13, you find out how to modify existing fields or to create new
ones from scratch. When you rename an existing field in ACT!, you then
tweak its label to reflect the change in field name. Typically, you start by
renaming one or all of the ten user fields. At that point, your work is almost
over because the field is already included in your layout. To change a field
label, simply double-click it; you’ll end up in the label edit mode, at which
point you can type in the new field label.
Make sure that the labels in the Layout Designer match the actual names of
the fields. For example, I might have a field called Men’s Room but give it the
label Ladies’ Room — and end up with very unexpected results!
Adding a new field from scratch to your ACT! database is a bit more compli-
cated because after you create the new field (see Chapter 13), you now need
to find a place for it on your layout. However, if you follow the upcoming
steps, you’ll find that adding the new field to your layout is certainly not an
insurmountable task:
1. Click the Field tool in the Layout Designer toolbox, hold down the left
mouse button, and then drag the cursor to the right to define the
field’s initial size and position on your layout.
The Select Field dialog box opens, presenting a list of all the fields that
do not currently appear on your existing layout. The fields are listed
alphabetically. If you add an address block, all the related fields appear
together, which allows you to easily add them all to your layout in one
fell swoop. For example, notice in Figure 14-2 that all the credit card
address fields are lined up together.
Chapter 13 talks about setting up new fields. In general, I recommend
setting up your new fields first and then placing them on the layout.
However, if you add your new fields to your layout and find that you
forgot to add one of your key new fields, don’t worry. Just click the
New Field button, conveniently located at the bottom-left corner of
the Select Field window, to add a new field on the fly.
215
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

Clicking the Field button allows you to add the vast majority of new
fields that you’ve added to your database. However, a few other field
types lurk in the Field section of the toolbox. These include
• Memo
• Picture
• Yes/No
• Record Manager
• Access
The Memo and Picture fields are super-sized fields that need to be made
larger than your other fields. The Yes/No fields are tiny little ones that are
only large enough to hold a check mark. Don’t worry if you’re having trou-
ble guesstimatin the size of those fields because ACT! automatically
resizes them for you. Chances are that you’ll never have to add the
Record Manager or Access fields to your database because they’re
already included in your original layouts — and you can’t add additional
fields of those types.
Even though the field is called a Yes/No field, it’s actually a check box
field that you click to indicate yes or no.
2. Select the field that you want to add to the layout, deselect the Include
a Label check box if you don’t want the field to have a label, and then
click the Add button.
The field is added to your layout. You can add as many fields to your
layout as you like, but you’re allowed to use each field only once.
3. When you’re done adding fields, click the Close button in the Select
Field dialog box.

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Changing the tabs
Just like you can add, move, or remove the individual fields of your database
on your layout, you can also add, move, or remove the tabs that are on your
layout. Using tabs is a great way to organize the fields in your database. For
example, you might have a Products tab that lists the various products that
you are tracking — or a Personal tab that includes contact info: his or her
birthday, anniversary, blood type, IQ, and shoe size. The whole point of being
able to customize your layout is to make it comfortable for you. If you find
yourself constantly hunting for a field, chances are that your fields are not
arranged in a logical fashion. If that’s the case, consider editing the tabs on
your layout:
1. From the Layout Designer, choose Edit➪Tabs.
The Edit Tabs dialog box appears (see Figure 14-3), where ACT! gives
you several tab customization options.
2. Hide any system tabs you no longer want to display in your layout.
The single left- and right-pointing arrows in the Edit Tabs dialog box
allow you to hide a system tab. Although the system tabs — Notes,
History, Activities, Groups, Opportunities, Secondary Contacts, and
Documents — can’t be deleted, you can hide them by moving them into
the Hidden Tabs area on the left side of the Edit Tabs dialog box.
3. Customize your tabs according to your own sense of design and order.
• Add Tab: Add an additional tab to your layout. Enter a name for the
new tab in the Add Tab Layout dialog box and then click OK. You
now need to go back and add some fields to that shiny new tab.
• Edit Tab: Give a tab a new name.
Figure 14-3:
Editing tabs
in an ACT!
layout.
217
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

• Delete Tab: Remove a tab other than a system tab from your layout.
When you remove a tab from a layout, all the fields located on that
tab are removed as well. Consider moving — or removing — all the
fields from a tab before you delete the tab itself!
• Move Up: Move a tab so that it appears before another tab.
• Move Down: Arrange a particular tab so that it appears after another.
4. Click Close when you’re happy with the names and order of your tabs.
Changing the order of things
You can — and should — use the Tab key to progress through your fields as
you input contact information into your database. When you start with an
ACT! layout right out of the box, you can tab through the fields in a logical
order — that is, from top to bottom. However, you might prefer to move hori-
zontally across the layout rather than vertically from top to bottom. Or, you
might find that after adding a few fields, you can no longer tab through your
fields with the greatest of ease. Modifying layouts generally renders the field
entry order non-sequential.
Although having out-of-sequence field ordering doesn’t damage your database,
it does make inputting data difficult. Each time you press the Tab key, your
cursor skips to the next numbered field instead of to the next field that you see
on your layout. This could be a real bummer if not for the fact that you can
reorder your fields when necessary. A tab stop is associated with every field on
your layout; the Tab Stop number determines the order of the fields.
Although an important step, consider waiting to change the field order until
you are absolutely, positively, 100 percent certain that you’re happy with how
you placed the fields on your layout. There is no magic way to simply number
the fields consecutively from 1 to 100; unless you want to waste a lot of your
time by redoing your work, you might save this step until after you live with
your layout for a while.
1. Choose View➪Tab Stops➪Show Tab Stops in ACT!’s Layout Designer.
The tab stop appears in the Layout Designer, as shown in Figure 14-4.
When you enter the land of Tab Stops, you’ll probably notice two things:
Little red numbers now appear to the right of each field, and you no
longer have the toolbox and Properties window to play with.
When you add a new field to your layout, ACT! automatically assigns the
field the next available field number. When changing the field number
order, focus on those fields because that’s where the numbering is out of
whack. If you remove a field number and don’t assign it to another field,
ACT! automatically assigns that number to the next field that you add to
your layout.
218
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. Select any fields for which you want to change the field order.
If you select the fields whose field entry order you want to change (refer
to Figure 14-4, where the fields are not numbered sequentially), the
number disappears.
3. Select the fields a second time to reassign the field the next available
number.
When you select the field again, the next available number is assigned to
the field. Feel free to select the fields in any order you want. After all,
this is your layout!
4. Right-click a field, choose Set Index, and type in a field number to
advance several fields at a time.
This is a great party trick in the event that you need to squeeze a field or
two in among all your existing fields and don’t want to have to click and re-
click each and every field in your layout. Say, for example, that your fields
are numbered sequentially from 1 to 61, and you want to stick a new field
smack under field 1. Whew! You’re looking at a lot of click time. But wait! If
you right-click field 2, choose Set Index, and change the field number to 3,
you see all the fields from 2 through 61 magically increase by one digit.
Figure 14-4:
Changing
the order of
the tab
stops.
219
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

I wish I had a great tip for decreasing the field numbers in the event that
you remove a field. Unfortunately, I don’t. And, I wish you could undo
the field numbers if you increase them by accident. You can’t. All I can
tell you is to be careful when setting the field index because it can’t
easily be reversed.
5. Choose View➪Tab Stops➪Show Tab Stops to leave the tab stop area.
6. Choose View➪Enter Stops➪Show Enter Stops to begin editing the
enter stops.
Just like the tab stops control the order that your cursor follows as you
tab through your layout, the enter stop controls the path your cursor
takes as you press Enter. Think of the enter stop as a bypass, allowing
you to skip merrily from one area of your layout to the next.
The enter stop looks and feels pretty much like the tab stop with two
major differences: The Enter Stop dialog box is tastefully decorated in
green instead of red, and you use a whole lot fewer of them. In general,
you want to place an enter stop at the beginning of each group of fields.
You might want to have one at the beginning of the address, one at the
start of the phone numbers, and a third one conveniently located on the
first of the personal fields.
7. Choose View➪Enter Stops➪Show Enter Stops to return to the Layout
Designer.
Beautifying Your Layout
I’ll admit that I count myself among the artistically challenged of this world.
If you read and assimilate everything in the beginning of this chapter, you’re
now pretty much equipped to go forth and design a nifty new layout. But
before tackling that new design project, you might first want to give some
thought to some of the things that can make your layout a bit more aestheti-
cally pleasing.
Doing minor touch-up work
At this juncture, you leave the area of function behind you and move on to
some of the more aesthetically pleasing aspects of layout design. You can
also decide whether your layout needs a major or minor makeover. The Edit
Properties dialog box (see Figure 14-5) allows you to make changes to the
font, font size, and other attributes, and to the basic border style. Right-click
the label or field you want to change and choose Edit Properties. This is great
for simple touch-up work but is rather limiting if your layout needs an
extreme makeover. For help with that, see the following section.
220
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Creating an extreme makeover
Use the Properties window if you want to create some major changes. There are
two great advantages to using the Properties window over the Edit Properties
dialog box. First, you can edit more than one field at a time. Secondly, you have
a whole lot more choice about which elements you can edit.
If you click around in the Layout Designer, the choices in the Properties window
change accordingly. For example, if you click in a field, you can change the
various color and font attributes; if you click in a label, you can edit the text
of the label.
If you’re having trouble reading the various options on the Properties window,
resize it so that you can read it better. Simply place your cursor over the left
edge of the window; when your cursor changes to a double pointing vertical
line, drag to the left to expand the window.
Changing a field label
In most cases, the field name and the field label are exactly the same. Having
a field label differ too radically from the name of the actual field proves to
be quite confusing when you wander into the area of template and report
creation. However, sometimes you might want to tweak the field label so that
it fits on your layout better. For example, a field named Cellular Telephone
Number might be shortened to a more readable label Cell.
You can change a field label with two different methods:
 Double-click the label.
The label turns into a text box with a blinking cursor. Delete any unnec-
essary letters and type the new label.
 Type the new field label in the Text section of the Properties window.

Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

Adding color to your drab life
ACT! comes with close to a zillion colors that you can add to your layouts.
Okay, you caught me; there might be a few less than a zillion, but I think just
about every color of the rainbow is represented. To use one of those nifty
colors, follow these steps:
1. Click in the background of your layout in the Layout Designer.
2. Select a background color from the Properties window.
You can now change the background color by clicking the Background
Color drop-down arrow and selecting a color that matches your mood —
or the décor of your office. Like magic, your background color changes.
If it doesn’t, it’s probably because a graphic is hiding that beautiful back-
ground color. If that’s the case, go on to the next section.
Some of you may be a little hard to please and find that the colors provided in
ACT! just don’t match the décor of your home or office. If you want to add your
own custom-blended color to your layout, mix your very own custom color via
the Custom Color tab. When you create a custom color, the Properties window
displays the RGB (red, green, and blue) number associated with the custom
color. Feel free to change those numbers if you’ve worked with graphic pro-
grams in the past and want to match your layout to a specific color.
Changing the colors of your fields and labels is just as easy. Just select the
fields or labels and change the color option in the Properties window exactly
like you do for the layout background.
You can select as many fields and/or labels as you like and then change the
color for your entire selection at the same time.
Got a few fields that you want to make sure are used by your users whenever
possible? Make a field mandatory by turning off the Allow Blank option in the
Define Fields dialog box. This option can be an annoying one if you just don’t
have the information needed to fill in the field at the time of your data input;
ACT! demands that you supply the missing information before you leave the
record. An alternative might be to highlight the critically important fields in a
stunning shade of yellow so that users recognize their importance without
being asked to supply information that they might not have.
Adding the Finishing Touches
Whew! After you add, delete, move, and color your fields, you’re ready to
sally forth into the world and start using your new layout. But wait! If you
look carefully at your layout, things might look a bit, well, cockeyed. (That’s
an official computer term to indicate that your fields seem out of whack
because they consist of various sizes and aren’t aligned properly.) If I didn’t
like you so well, I’d tell you to grab your mouse and start adjusting those
222
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

whacko fields by dragging them into submission. Several hours later, after
much dragging, resizing, and probably quite a bit of cursing, you’d probably
end up in pretty much the same place as you started. But because the point
of this whole book is to show you how to do things the easy way, you might
want to read the following sections instead.
Lining up fields and labels
One way to give your layout a truly polished look is align all fields and labels.
When you move a field to a new location on your layout, there is a strong
possibility that the field is slightly out of line, both vertically and horizon-
tally, with the other fields. Of course, you can always try to “eyeball it” by
dragging the field around, trying to get it into just the perfect spot. This
method can be very time consuming, aggravating, and hard on your carpal
tunnel. I have a much easier — and precise — way to accomplish your goal:
1. Select the errant field that is out of alignment.
2. Click the anchor field (the field that is properly aligned).
If you look closely, the selection boxes around the errant field are white,
and the selection boxes around the anchor field are black. This is your
indication that the anchor field stays in place, and the other field lines
up with it.
You can align several fields at a time by selecting them and right-clicking
the anchor field. The field you right-clicked now becomes the anchor,
and all the other selected fields line up with it.
Hold down your Shift or Ctrl key while clicking the fields in your layout
to select more than one of those puppies at a time.
3. Right-click any of the selected fields and choose an alignment option.
As you can see in Figure 14-6, you’re given a whole bunch of options
from which to choose. Here are the two you’ll probably use most often:
Figure 14-6:
Aligning
fields and
labels.
223
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

• Align Lefts: Typically your fields look the best lined up along the
left edges looking vertically down the layout. To do this, you want
to select your fields from top to bottom before aligning.
• Align Tops: When you have two or three columns in your layout, you
want your fields to align along the top edges as well. Select your
fields horizontally, from left to right, before choosing this option.
If you choose the incorrect alignment option, you might end up with a
mess in which all your fields are now on top of one another. Quick!
Reach for the Undo button. Don’t see it? Choose Edit➪Undo.
4. Click anywhere in your layout to remove the selection boxes.
Resizing fields
You’ll probably find yourself in a number of situations in which you need to
resize one or more fields. Typically, you want to make several fields smaller to
squeeze more fields into your layout. You might want to make several fields
larger to add more data into those fields. Or, you might find that a new field you
just placed on your layout isn’t the exact same size as the other fields. Again,
you can manually resize your fields one at a time. You can also knock your head
firmly against the wall several times, but I don’t recommend either activity.
 To resize several fields at once: Select all the fields that you want to
resize en masse. Then place your cursor on one of the selection boxes
on either the left or right edge of the selected fields. When your cursor
turns into a single horizontal arrow, drag the selection box to the left or
right, depending on whether you’re making the fields larger or smaller.
 To resize against the anchor: Select all the fields that you want to be the
exact same size as an anchor field. Press the Ctrl key, click the anchor
field once, pause, and then click it a second time so that the selection
boxes are now black. Choose Format➪Make Same Size➪Width.
Adding a logo or a graphic
Perhaps the best way to truly personalize your layout is by adding your very
own logo to it. Adding a graphic to the layout means that the graphic appears
on each and every one of your contact records. Don’t confuse this with using
with a Picture field; a Picture field varies for every one of your contacts. You
can add your chef-d’oeuvre to your layout by following these easy steps:
1. From the Layout Designer, click the Drawing tool from the toolbox
and then choose the Image tool.
2. Using your mouse, draw a shape on your layout to match the graphic
you want to insert.
The Open dialog box opens.
224
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

3. Navigate to the graphic you want to insert, select it, and click Open.
The graphic now appears on your layout. You can drag the graphic to a
new, improved location by placing your cursor on any of the edges of
your graphic. When your cursor turns into a plus sign, drag the graphic
to the appropriate spot on your layout. 
Your graphic appears exactly the same size as it was originally created. If the
graphic is too large or small to fit your layout, resize it using a graphics pro-
gram. You might find, however, that the frame that you drew in Step 2 doesn’t
exactly fit your graphic. You can resize it by placing your mouse on one of the
white squares that borders the graphic and dragging the border to match the
size of your graphic.
Creating a circle in a square 
Admittedly, no one would ever confuse me with Picasso. However, some of
you might be of a more artistic persuasion, or just want to take advantage of
some of the drawing tools to add a little clarity to your layout. By creating a
square that is slightly larger than a grouping of several of your fields, you in
essence create a frame that serves to highlight those fields.
If you click the Drawing tool in the toolbox, notice the Rectangle and Ellipse
options; these are just fancy words for square and circle. At any rate, by click-
ing either of these options, you can draw a square or circle (okay, a rectangle
or an ellipsis) on your layout. After they’re drawn, you can head over to the
Properties window and change the color of your newly created shape. This is
a great way to emphasize a group of fields, particularly if your layout is start-
ing to look cluttered.
Did your newly created circle or square plunk itself down on top of your
existing fields? Although this leads to an interesting work of art, you probably
prefer to have the graphic behind the fields. Don’t panic; simply right-click
the graphic in question and choose Send to Back.
Adding text boxes
If a picture is worth a thousand words, a text box might just be worth a million.
Inconsistent data input is a sure-fire way to decrease the productivity of your
database. This lack of uniformity is often caused not by lack of knowledge but
rather by lack of communication. Adding a text box to your layout is a great
way to help users input key pieces of information in the right place and to help
organize the groups of data on the layout. Use your text boxes to create a head-
ing for a group of fields or to include data input instructions to your users.
1. From the toolbox, click the Drawing tool and then choose the Text tool.
Your cursor now looks like a plus sign instead of the normal arrow.
225
Chapter 14: Customizing Layouts

2. Find the spot on the layout to add a text box, hold down your left
mouse button, and drag the cursor to create a box.
3. Enter the text in your new text box.
Guess that’s why they call it a text box. Feel free to write a book here if
you wish. When you’re finished, just click one of the text box borders
and watch in awe as little white squares appear all around your text box.
Feel free to grab any one of those boxes and expand your horizons — or
in this case your text box — to accommodate your verbiage.
4. Use the Properties window to customize your text box.
Here’s where you can really have fun. As long as the new text box is
selected, you can change the text, font attributes, font color, and back-
ground color of the text box.
I’m a firm believer in doing things the easy way whenever possible. If you find
yourself longing to have several text boxes all formatted the same way, create
the first text box, customize it just the way you like it, and then clone it by
right-clicking it and choosing Copy. At that point, you can paste it on your
layout — and the only thing you have to change is the text.
Building a table
If you find yourself running out of room on your layouts because you needed
to add so many customized fields, here’s a workaround. As an alternative to
the traditional concept of listing all your field labels next to your actual fields,
arrange your fields in table format, as shown in Figure 14-7. The idea here is
to save room and allow you to easily fill in vital information.
Consider building a table if you have several products and need to track the
purchase date, serial number, and expiration date for each one. Or maybe
you’re a realtor and want to list the dimensions of several rooms. Not all
databases can take advantage of a table format, but those that can will bene-
fit from freeing a lot of space on their layout.

I
n this chapter, I show you how to take care of your motorcycle . . . er, I mean
your database. Would you believe that your ACT! database is very similar to
a motorcycle? Both are made up of many moving parts that require mainte-
nance. Failure to provide routine maintenance can result in big problems — for
a motorcycle as well as for your database. If something does go wrong, having a
backup is nice and (in most cases) necessary to keep your job. Sometimes your
motorcycle gets dirty; likewise, your database is prone to clutter. You some-
times have to bite the bullet, roll up your sleeves, and do a little cleaning — and
clear out old or duplicate contact records from ACT!.
Regular maintenance keeps your database running efficiently. When you
don’t provide routine maintenance for a motorcycle, things get corroded;
likewise, when you don’t provide maintenance for your database, your
records become corrupted. Weird things start happening. No, you won’t see a
ghost, but you might not see a note that you know you created the day
before. Or that note just might pop up again later — in the wrong place!
Understanding the Need 
to Check and Repair
I love to change the messages on my voice mail, and one of my favorite
choices is, “Have you checked and repaired your database today?” Users

often offer up a variety of excuses for why they don’t perform routine data-
base maintenance. These excuses range anywhere from “I didn’t have time”
to “I didn’t know I was supposed to.” Of course, many of you give these
excuses after your database is already damaged. By then, of course, it could
be too late for checking and repairing. If you are the Database Administrator,
you are responsible for the maintenance of the database because the mainte-
nance can only be done by an Administrator.
Determining the maintenance frequency
If you’re a little old lady from Pasadena who uses your database only once in
a blue moon, you might get away without maintaining your database.
However, if the data in ACT! is extremely important to you, perform your
maintenance on a routine basis. At a minimum, I recommend that your data-
base receives a bit of tender loving care at least once a week.
My general rule is that the frequency of maintenance is directly tied to the
amount of use that your database receives. There is no such thing as doing
too much maintenance — only too little! Here are some situations that war-
rant more than weekly maintenance:
 You have a multi-user database.
When ACT! is used over a network, the database is subject to more use —
and abuse. The chances of having inaccurate and incorrect information
increase exponentially with the number of users entering data into the
database.
 You have a large database.
 You add new fields to your database.
 You make changes to the drop-down lists in your database.
 You add or delete numerous contact records to your database.
 You import another database into your existing ACT! database.
 You add — or delete — users to your database.
 You experienced a power surge, brownout, or outage.
 You had network problems.
 You suspect that your database is corrupted.
 You had a really lousy day when everything seemed to go wrong.
228
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

A little shopping list of database horrors
Database corruption comes in many shapes and sizes. The following list
describes some of the more common indications — the warning signs — of a
corrupted ACT! database:
 While trying to open a database, you receive an error message or ACT!
stops responding. Smoke might be seen rising from the back of your CPU.
 You receive error messages while working in ACT!.
 You can’t log into the database as a particular user.
 Information appears to be missing or mysteriously appears attached to
the incorrect contact record.
 You notice a significant increase or decrease in the number of contact
records in your database.
 Your database acts funny or runs slower than usual.
If you notice one — or heaven forbid, more than one — of the preceding
warning signs, I’m sorry to say that the time has come to either perform CPR
on your fainthearted co-workers or perform some simple database mainte-
nance. In the next section, I give you the details on performing the simple
database maintenance (that is, checking and repairing). You’re on your own
with the CPR.
Sometimes determining whether the corruption is in the database or in the
ACT! program itself is difficult. To determine this, try opening the Act8demo
database that installs on your computer when you install ACT!. If the
Act8demo opens and runs correctly, the problem lies with your database. If
you encounter the same problems in the Act8demo database that you’re
having in your own database, you might need to reinstall ACT!.
Performing Routine Maintenance
The old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” does not apply to ACT!. Proper
maintenance enables your database to run efficiently and improves perfor-
mance. Some of the maintenance takes on a rather behind-the-scenes approach;
users don’t detect that maintenance has been performed. They know, however,
that the maintenance hasn’t been done if they start running into problems with
the database. The other type of maintenance involves actual data cleanup;
astute users can detect that changes have been made to the database.
229
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

Only the Database Administrator can perform routine maintenance to ensure
that your database continues to chug away without any problems. That’s
probably to ensure that everyone knows at whom to point if things go wrong.
Some maintenance tasks require that all users log off of the database so that
the database can be locked, but those can be scheduled for off-peak or even
overnight hours.
In ACT!, basic maintenance is referred to as checking and repairing. The
Database Administrator can run the Check and Repair tool regularly to
ensure a healthy database, which consists of two procedures: the Integrity
Check and the Re-index. These procedures are very similar to the Scan Disk
and Disk Defragmenter procedures on a Windows PC. The Integrity Check
scours the database for errors and repairs them if found. After any found
errors are repaired, Re-index squeezes out all the little empty spaces that are
left in your database when you delete contact records in order to ensure max-
imum performance.
Yikes! Performing the Check and Repair sounds really important so you’re
probably thinking that it must be really hard. Wrong! Here’s all you need to do:
1. Log in as an Administrator and make sure that all other users are
logged off the database.
If the Check and Repair command is grayed out from ACT!’s Tools menu,
you don’t have sufficient administrative rights to perform that option.
You might want to jog your database Administrator’s memory a bit to
remind him that his salary is directly proportional to the efficient perfor-
mance of your database!
2. Choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Check and Repair.
The Check and Repair Database window opens, as shown in Figure 15-1.
3. Select both the Integrity Check and Re-index options and then click OK.
Your computer makes a few whirring noises, and a snazzy indicator bar
appears momentarily onscreen. (Try to look important during this time
so as to justify your administrative salary.) When ACT! finishes the main-
tenance, you receive a cheerful message telling you that everything is
hunky-dory.

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Backing Up the ACT! Database
You probably already know the three rules of real estate: location, location,
location. Similarly, the three basic rules of computing are backup, backup,
backup! With the proliferation of viruses, as well as the poor construction of
many computers, backing up on a daily basis is imperative. Failure to do so
can result in loss of data — as well as time and money! Having a recent
backup enables you to recover quickly when the unexpected happens. (It
might also ensure that you receive a paycheck at the end of the week.)
Only Administrators and Managers of the ACT! database get to back up a
database. After a database is backed up, only an Administrator can restore it.
Because every database requires an Administrator, you automatically landed
the job if you are the only user of the database. If you need to back up the
database and find that the backup option is grayed out on the File menu, you
must find a database Administrator and wheedle him or her into changing
your permissions. In Chapter 3, I explain the various ACT! user permissions.
If you make major changes to your database — such as importing new records,
deleting old contact records, or modifying existing fields — I recommend cre-
ating a backup before you start, just in case!
When you create an ACT! database, ACT! thoughtfully automatically creates
several folders for you. In addition to a database folder that houses the main
database files, ACT! creates subfolders for your attachments, layouts, queries,
reports, and templates. When you back up your database, ACT! compresses
all the data into a single Zip file.
In addition to the aforementioned folders, ACT! also creates a backup folder.
Sounds like a good idea; however, if your database is located on your local
machine, chances are pretty good that the backup folder lives there as well.
One of the main reasons to create a backup is to make sure that you have a
copy of your database just in case something goes drastically wrong with
your computer. If something bad does happen to your computer — and that’s
where your backup is stored — you’ll find yourself without a computer, data-
base, or backup.
In a corporate setting, the ACT! database often resides on a network drive
and is backed up to a tape drive on a daily basis. However, you might be feel-
ing a false sense of security knowing that this backup is taking place. ACT! is
an SQL database — meaning that unless you have a special tool, a routine
network backup will not back up your ACT! database. Feeling scared? Remind
your IT person that his job security is directly related to the security of your
database. Chapter 16 will give him a few alternatives.
231
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

If you use backup software or store your data on an Internet site, remember
that an ACT! database consists of more than a single file. You need to store
the Zip file backup that ACT! creates in order to ensure that you do indeed
collect all the bits and pieces of your database.
Performing the basic ACT! backup
You must have Administrator or Manager security level to back up your ACT!
database. Open the ACT! database that you want to create a backup copy of
and follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Back Up➪Database.
The Back Up Database dialog box appears, displaying the location for
the backup database, as shown in Figure 15-2.
2. To back up the database to a different location from what’s showing,
click the Browse button, select a new location for your backup file,
and then click Save.
ACT! automatically places ACT! in front of your database name and ends
the backup file with the .zip extension.
3. Select the option to password-protect your database (optional).
In case you fear spies lurking about, password-protect the backup file.
However, you might not feel the urge to do so, knowing that only data-
base Administrators can use the file.
4. Click OK.
An indicator bar appears, letting you know that ACT! is creating your
backup. The time required to complete your backup varies depending
on the size of your database and the supplemental files that are included
in your backup. When the backup is complete, a message appears telling
you that your backup was completed successfully!
Figure 15-2:
The 
Back Up
Database
dialog box.
232
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Backing up to various media 
Backing up a database is easy. The hard part is knowing where to place your
backup. For nearly 20 years, computer users relied on the floppy disk as their
backup method of choice. You can kiss those floppies good-bye because they
just aren’t big enough to hold your backup. By default, ACT! places your
backup file on your computer’s hard drive. That’s great if your hard drive is
ultimately being backed up, but not so great if it isn’t — and your computer
grinds to a painful halt. Here are a couple of good alternatives to your backup
housing dilemma:
 Zip drive: I know this sounds confusing, but you can place your backup
Zip file on a Zip drive.
 USB storage drive: These tiny powerhouses can store the equivalent of
100 floppy disks on a device the size of your thumb.
 CD/DVD burner: These puppies come installed on most of the new PCs.
 External hard drive: The price of external hard drives has plummeted
in recent years; you might want to purchase one to store backups of all
your data files.
Restoring a backup copy of your database
A backup is no good if you don’t know how to use it to restore your data.
Although I hope you never have to use a backup copy, follow these steps to
restore a copy of your database:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Restore➪Database.
The Restore Database dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3:
Restoring a
backup.
233
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

2. Select one of the restoration options and click OK.
• Restore: Restores all files to their original locations; this restoration
option is most commonly used when data is lost or corrupted.
• Restore As: Allows you to restore the database to a new location
with a new filename; this option works well when you want to copy
a database or move it to another computer.
• Unpack and Restore Remote Database: Allows you to install a data-
base that synchronizes back to the main database.
3. Click the Browse button to navigate to the location where the backup
file is stored; click Save and then click OK.
Backup files end with the .zip extension.
Many of you are familiar with the .zip extension because you’ve worked
with the WinZip software. However, don’t be tempted to unzip an ACT!
backup file using WinZip. The files aren’t placed in the correct locations,
and the backup file is probably rendered useless!
4. Type the backup file password if prompted and click OK.
5. Type the Administrator’s name and password and click OK.
Yikes! ACT! shows you the scary warning message that you see in Figure
15-4. The warning explains in no uncertain terms that if you continue,
your database will be overwritten with older files. If your current data-
base is a corrupted mess, that’s a good thing; if your database is per-
fectly fine, that could be a bad thing!
6. Click Yes to acknowledge that you want to continue.
Your computer whirs and hisses for a few moments and soon the
restored database opens.
Performing Spring Housecleaning
The good news is that if you’re reading this, you’re probably the Administrator
of the ACT! database; after all, if you’re not the Administrator, you don’t have
the necessary permission to perform most of the administrative tasks. The
Figure 15-4:
Scary

warning
message.
234
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

bad news is that with the job title comes quite a bit of responsibility — and
hopefully a large salary.
In addition to performing the obvious mechanical maintenance chores, you
probably want to do a little bit of extra housecleaning . . . er, database clean-
ing from time to time. Having blank, duplicate, or incorrect contact informa-
tion serves no purpose other than to make your database perform less
efficiently. So bite the bullet, roll up your sleeves, and get cleaning.
Before you perform any type of maintenance, I strongly recommend that you
back up your database so that you can retrieve any data you accidentally
delete.
Weeding out duplicate contacts
Finding pesky duplicates in your database is tricky but not impossible. Because
having multiple records for the same person or company is common, ACT!
allows you a way to easily check for duplicate records based on predefined cri-
teria. You can then create a lookup of the duplicate records and delete them.
You can also change the criteria used to find these duplicate records.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Scan for Duplicates.
By default, ACT! looks for duplicate contact records based on the com-
pany name, contact name, and phone number. If the contents of these
three fields are identical for two or more contacts, ACT! views them as
duplicates. As you can see in Figure 15-5, you can now specify how ACT!
checks for duplicate contact records in the Duplicate Checking dialog box.
2. In the Find Duplicate Contacts area, choose the three fields you want
ACT! to use to search for duplicate contact data.
3. Click OK.
The Contact List opens, along with a dialog box informing you that dupli-
cates were found, asking whether you would like to combine them. From
Figure 15-5:
Defining
duplication
criteria.
235
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

this list, you can delete records, keep records, or combine duplicate
records.
4. If you want to combine duplicates, click Yes to continue at the prompt.
The Copy/Move Contact Data window opens. This is the first of six win-
dows that you go through when merging duplicate contacts. Merging
duplicates is a slow, grueling task; you have to merge your duplicates on
a pair-by-pair basis.
After two contacts are merged together, there is no unmerge function.
Proceed with caution!
As you progress through the wizard, you perform the following six tasks:
a. Select a pair of duplicates.
b. Decide whether you want to copy the information from the first con-
tact record to the second contact record — or vice versa.
c. Choose a source and a contact. Depending on your choice, one of
the contacts becomes the source, and the other one is the target.
By default the new, merged contact contains all the target informa-
tion. If you want to retain any source field information, click in the
field and then click the Copy button.
d. Choose whether you want to move additional information from the
source to the target or have the information remain duplicated on both
records. As you see in Figure 15-6, you indicate this in the third step.
e. Select the additional elements that you want to merge together:
notes, histories, activities, opportunities, secondary contacts and
documents. If the source contact has three notes and the target
Figure 15-6:
Move
additional
information
from the
source to
the target
record.
236
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

has four different notes, the final contact ends up with seven notes
(if my math is working correctly).
f. Indicate whether to keep or delete the source record. For your conve-
nience, ACT! recaps the information to make your decision easier.
If you decide to delete the source record, click Yes on the scary
warning that confirms that you might be losing information.
5. Click Finish, and your two duplicate records merge into one.
You cannot undelete deleted records or contact information. If you inadver-
tently delete important information, run — don’t walk — to your backup file
and restore your information.
For many of you, merging two contact records together is only the tip of the
iceberg. You need to repeat the merge process again for each pair of dupli-
cates in your database. And, after you complete the process, you might want
to start over again by changing the duplicate checking criteria.
As I stress throughout this book, having some semblance of uniformity is
very important. Lack of uniformity is a great way to sabotage your database.
A search for all your clients in Ft. Lauderdale does not include those clients in
Fort Lauderdale. In the same way, a company or contact might be duplicated
if it is entered into your database in two different ways. For example, you
might have John Q. Public and John Public, or ABC Company and ABC Co. ACT!
doesn’t recognize any of these examples as duplicates.
You can change the criteria that ACT! uses to look for duplicate records. To
find the duplicates that I mention in the preceding paragraph, you need to
use a different criterion for your search. Changing your search parameters to
search for duplicated phone numbers might just give you the results that
you’re looking for.
Removing old data
ACT! users tend to be extremely loyal; it’s not unusual to run into ACT!
fanACTics who have been using ACT! religiously for over 15 years. Over time,
the amount of information that is stored in ACT! gets larger and larger, and
that information can become less and less important. ACT! provides you with
a simple tool for clearing the clutter from your database. (I just wish I had a
similar tool to clear the clutter from my closet!)
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Remove
Old Data.
The Remove Old Data dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-7.
237
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

2. In the Remove from Database area, select the type of data you want to
remove and indicate the number of days that you want to use to
remove that data.
To get rid of data that is older than a year, indicate 365 days; to get rid of
data that is more than two years old, indicate 730 days; and so on.
3. Click OK.
Like a champ, ACT! searches, scrubs, and ultimately removes any data that
matches your selection criteria.
If you’re still not feeling really comfortable with blowing away some of your
older note, history, and activity information, you do have a few alternatives.
First, you can always make an archival database so that you can refer to that
information if necessary. Secondly, a number of add-on products allow you to
specify even more precisely the type of notes, histories, and activities that
you delete. Check in Chapter 24 to read more about the ACT! Add-on store.
Deleting a database
You might wonder why you ever want to delete your database. That’s good
thinking because you’re right — you don’t want to delete your database.
However, you might have inherited several databases that you no longer use,
or perhaps you created a database or two for specific, temporary purposes.
Many so-called ACT! “experts” create a multitude of databases in their
attempt to learn ACT!. In general, allowing users to have access to more than
one database is not a good idea; chances are pretty good that one of your
users ends up in the wrong database. Having a multitude of extraneous data-
bases can also put extra strain on your resources and slow down your gen-
eral performance.
Figure 15-7:
The Remove
Old Data
window.
238
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Before deleting a database, I recommend backing it up, just in case. You
might also consider moving the database to another location for safekeeping
rather than deleting it. Deleting a database is ridiculously simple — but
impossible to undelete once deleted. Proceed with caution.
Okay, are you ready? Take a deep breath and follow these steps to delete the
database:
1. Open the database that you wish to delete.
Be sure to close all other databases. In previous versions of ACT!, you
couldn’t delete an open database — only closed ones. However, when
you send the all-clear to fire away, ACT! 2005 and 2006 delete the cur-
rently opened database. Govern yourself accordingly!
2. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪
Delete Database.
The Delete Database window opens, verifying that you absolutely want
to delete, destroy, and make the current database disappear forever.
3. Click Yes to bid your database adieu.
Ironically, ACT! gives you two options to change your mind: No or Cancel
both serves to keep your database safely in place.
Copying or moving contact data
One of the neat utilities included with ACT! is the ability to copy or move
selected field information from one record to the next — for example, when
an existing contact leaves a company to work at another company. When you
create a new record for the individual, you realize that his previous record
still contains pertinent information, such as his home phone number and
birthday. By using the Copy/Move command, you can move that specific field
information from his old contact record to his new one. You can then edit the
original contact record with the contact details of the new, replacement one.
ACT!’s Copy/Move Contact Data function works almost exactly like the Scan
for Duplicate function (in the earlier section, “Weeding out duplicate con-
tacts”). The only difference is that unlike the duplication procedure, you’re
not presented with a list of contacts to start with. The onus is on you to
select the two records whose field information you want to copy or move.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Copy/Move Contact Data.
Look familiar? It’s the Duplicate Checking dialog box (refer to Figure 15-6).
239
Chapter 15: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

2. Click Next to proceed through the wizard screens.
Proceed through the wizard while remembering a few key points:
• The source record is the record that contains the data that you
want to copy.
• The target record is the record you want to copy data to.
• You have the option to copy or move data on a field-by-field basis.
• You have the option to keep or delete the original source record.
Performing a global edit/replace
Another way to keep your database working well is by ensuring that all fields
contain consistent information. Maybe some of your contacts have the city
listed in all capitals while others don’t. Perhaps some contacts are listed in
Florida whereas other contacts reside in FL or Fla. This lack of consistency
makes it extremely difficult to query your database. Like a forgiving mother,
ACT! provides you with the ability to correct the error of your ways. After
you pinpoint your inconsistencies, you can standardize them in one fell
swoop (rather than by correcting each field on an item-by-item basis):
1. Perform your lookup.
In the preceding example, you might create a lookup of FLA and then
add Florida to the mix. If you need help, flip to Chapter 6 and review the
section on lookups.
Unless you’re planning on changing field data for every contact in your
database, make sure you perform a lookup before proceeding. These
changes are irreversible! For example, say you notice 27 instances of Fla
that you want to change to FL. If you fail to do a lookup first, you end up
changing the State field for every contact in your database to FL rather
than just for the original 27 that you intend to change. Unfortunately,
unless you have a backup handy, you’re stuck with the changes because
(again!) these changes are irreversible.
2. From any ACT! screen, choose Edit➪Replace Field.
If you prefer, you can choose one of the other two options as well:
• Swap Field: This option swaps the information between two fields.
• Copy Field: This option copies information from one field and
repeats it in a second field.
You now see the Replace Data dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-8.
240
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

3. Select your desired field from the Replace Contents Of drop-down list.
You can select from virtually any of your contact fields with the excep-
tion of the system fields.
4. Enter the desired information in the Value field.
In this example, you type FL in the field. To make life even easier, ACT!
supplies you with the appropriate drop-down list based on the field you
indicated in Step 3.
5. Click OK.
6. Read the warning that appears.
Generally speaking, when life — or ACT! — gives you a warning, it’s a
good idea to heed it. ACT! is politely asking you to verify that you intend
to change all the contact records in the current lookup (see Figure 15-9).
If you’re not sure as to the exact number of contacts in the current
lookup, click No, return to the Contact Detail window or Contact List,
and read the record counter in the top-left corner.
7. Click Yes.
ACT! might have to think about this for a moment depending on the
number of contact records in your lookup. When it finishes, you’ll notice
that the field that you indicated in Step 3 has now changed for each of
the contact records in your lookup.

A few more housekeeping tips
Sure, ACT! can mechanically maintain the integrity of your database.
However, you, as the Administrator, can do a few things to help ensure a
healthy database:
 If your organization has customized the database, limit the number of
users who have permission to edit layouts and add new items to the
drop-down lists.
 Periodically clear unwanted items from the drop-down lists. Insist that
the users routinely pick items from the drop-down lists when entering
new data.
 To avoid duplication of contacts, emphasize the importance of querying
the database for an existing contact before entering a new one.
 Delete any fields not being used.
 Delete outdated attachments, layouts, reports, templates, and queries.
 Be cognizant of field length. If you have a field that holds a Yes or No
value, consider trimming the field length down to three characters.
 Save contact records you rarely use to a different database and then
remove them from the main database. Use a Contact Activity lookup to
locate infrequently used records.

hapter 15 talks about the maintenance procedures that should be done 
on a fairly routine basis. This chapter calls in the big guns and is intended
primarily for those of you who use ACT! in a networked environment. And
because you are working in a workgroup, you’re probably using ACT! Premium
for Workgroups. Many of the features, including custom defining user roles, 
limiting contact access, and scheduling your maintenance are found only in 
the Premium edition of ACT!. Other features, such as adding users and net-
working, can be accomplished with the Standard version of ACT! but apply to
only those of you with multiple users accessing your database. Last but not
least, the importing feature applies to anyone who needs to get another data-
base or list of contact information into ACT!.
Working with the Database Users 
A Record Manager is a contact in your database who is also a user of your
database. If several people enter data into your ACT! database, I highly rec-
ommend setting up each person as a Record Manager. If you and Jane are
both set up as users of the database, you need to make sure that you log in as
you and Jane logs in as herself. ACT! automatically enters several key pieces
of information based on how you log in to the database. For example, you’re
recognized as the record creator of each new contact that you add to the data-
base. Likewise, if Jane enters a note, that note is associated with her name. If
you generate a document from one of ACT!’s templates, your name — not
Jane’s — appears as the generator of that document. Most importantly, your
name is associated with any meetings, calls, or to-do’s that you schedule in

ACT!. Having unique, identifiable users in a database allows you to view your
own activities on a calendar. Otherwise, you might find yourself driving to
Podunk to visit Jane’s mom on her birthday!
Only the Database Administrator has permission to add new users to the
ACT! database.
Adding new users to the database
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose Tools➪Manage Users.
The Manage Users dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16-1.
2. Click Create New User.
In the next window that appears, you are given a choice to create the
new user from an existing contact or to create a brand new user who
isn’t currently a member of your current database.
Always double-check that the new user doesn’t already reside in your
database as an existing contact. When you set up a brand-new user, you
also set up a brand-new contact, which could result in an “evil twin” situ-
ation. For example, although you know only one John Smith, he is repre-
sented twice in your database — once as a user and the other time as
simply a member of your database.
3. Choose either Existing Contact or New Contact and then click Next.
• Existing Contact: If you choose the Existing Contact option, you see
a list of all the contacts in your database.
Figure 16-1:
Adding a
new
database
user.

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

a. You can sort the list alphabetically by either contact or company by
clicking the corresponding column heading.
b. After you sort the list, type in the first couple of letters of the contact’s
last name or company (depending on how you sorted the list) in the
Look For text box.
ACT! magically takes you to that name.
c. Click Next to continue.
• New Contact: If you choose the New Contact option, a dialog 
box opens that is similar to the Manage Users dialog box. (See 
Figure 16-2.)
4. If the new user you added is also new to your database, you need to
type in his/her name.
If you already indicated the name of the user in Step 3, his/her name is
sitting there waiting for you.
5. Fill in the user name.
The user name is not case sensitive. Just make sure you remember what
name you decide on. If you set up multiple users for the same database,
consider sticking to a set naming convention: Gary Kahn or gkahn are
good choices; you might want to avoid Gary B. Kahn or Gary Kahn, Esq.
6. Fill in the password.
By now you know the drill: You type in the password once, and because
that was so much fun, you type it a second time.
7. Choose the security role of the new user and then click Next.
Figure 16-2:
Enter user
information.
245
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

ACT! provides you with five levels of security. Because you are the
Administrator, you set those levels for all subsequent users.
• Browse: This user has the most limited role; he or she can view
contacts, view calendars, and add activities. The Browse user
cannot add, modify, or delete contacts; or modify or add any 
other data.
The Browse role is typically assigned to users who need to look up
calendar details and schedule activities. In the real world, the data-
base Administrator typically assigns a user Browse level access if
he has serious doubts as to the user’s ability to add data.
• Restricted: This role allows users to access only areas of the appli-
cation to which he or she is granted permission. The Restricted
role is typically assigned to users working in a support capacity. 
A Restricted user can access all data that he or she creates but
cannot delete any data, even if he or she created it. This role 
also doesn’t allow users to create companies or groups.
• Standard: A Standard user is the default user role assigned to new
users. The Standard user can see the records in a database that 
he creates or is given explicit access to. Standard users can add,
delete, and modify records; and synchronize data. A Standard user
cannot add new users to the database, perform database mainte-
nance, back up the database, import and export data, or modify
database fields and layouts.
• Manager: A Manager role is the second-most-powerful user role.
Typically, Managers are people, such as sales managers, who
manage the various users of the database and control the types of
data that is entered into the database. Managers generally don’t
have the time — or sometime the technical knowledge — to use
the various maintenance tools that I describe in Chapter 17. The
Manager can access nearly all the areas of ACT! except for data-
base maintenance and user management. The Manager is also
restricted from viewing, editing, or deleting the private records 
of other individuals.
• Administrator: The Administrator can perform any database func-
tion and is the chief, the head honcho, the Big Guy — the person
everyone blames if something goes wrong with the database. When
a user creates a database, he or she is automatically assigned the
Administrator role. This role is the most powerful role in ACT!, with
access to all areas of the application and all data in the supplemen-
tal files folders. The only thing the Administrator can’t do is access,
edit, or delete records marked as private by another user (and get
out of speeding tickets when caught doing 50 in a 35 mph zone).
Be sure to note which users you give the Administrator user level.
These users are the only ones who can add users, create a backup,
and perform routine maintenance on the database.
246
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Assigning two users as Administrators of the database is always a good
idea. Not only do those two people feel extra special, but it can save
your little rear end. As hard as it might be to believe, the Administrator
might leave the company suddenly, and without warning — taking the
keys for the rest room and the password for the database with him. This
means you might not be able to access the database, perform routine
maintenance, add users, or make field changes. You might also find your-
self looking for a new job. Remember: No password, no entry!
8. Select the Logon Access check box option and then click Next.
This option enables the new user to access your database. If you don’t
want a user to have access to your database, feel free to clear this check
box. I show you how to delete and disable (but hopefully not maim!)
your database users later in this chapter.
9. Select additional options that the user might be able to access.
These additional options are only customizable for Standard and Manager
level users. These options aren’t available to the Browsers and Restricted
users in the audience, and of course, Mr. Bigshot Administrator automati-
cally has all these options available to him.
• Accounting Link Tasks: Allows the user to install and use an
Accounting link.
• Handheld Device Sync: Gives permission for the user to set up his
handheld device and synchronize his ACT! data into it.
• Remote Administration: Lets the user of a synchronizing remote
database back up, restore, and check and repair his own database.
In other words, the user becomes an “almost-Administrator” for
his database.
• Export to Excel: Permits the user to export any list view informa-
tion into Excel.
• Delete Records: Authorizes the Standard user to delete records
(contacts, companies, groups, activity series, notes, histories,
opportunities, and secondary contacts) that he/she owns. By
default, the Manager already has the permission to delete at will.
The above options are available only in the ACT! Premium for
Workgroups edition. Sorry, the alloy wheel option is still available 
only for cars!
10. Click Finish.
Deleting login users
After you master adding new users to your database, you need to know how
to delete users when they leave. After all, easy come, easy go. The first thing
247
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

that you need to do is to determine whether you’re going to actually delete
the user or just deny him or her access to the database. There is a slight 
difference.
If you are the database Administrator and you simply want to stop someone
from accessing the database, you can do so without having to actually delete
that person as a user. You can simply shut off her login privileges (a very
simple process).
One of the reasons why you add users to the database is so they can perform
various functions, such as scheduling appointments and creating notes. The
user’s name is also associated with any contact that he may create. Opting to
shut off a user’s login privileges, rather than delete that user entirely, elimi-
nates the possibility of losing this information. Here’s how you shut off a
user’s access to the database:
1. Choose Tools➪Manage Users from any ACT! screen.
The Manage Users dialog box opens (refer to Figure 16-1).
2. Select the name of the user for whom you wish to change the access
rights.
3. Click Edit User Information.
4. Click Next to bypass the Password window.
If you’re removing a user’s ability to log in to the database, he no longer
can use a password.
5. Select Inactive and then click Finish.
If you’re using ACT! 2005 Standard Edition, you are limited to ten active users.
When someone no longer works for your company — or no longer needs
access to the database — make sure you change the user information to
reflect his or her inactive status.
Some of you are still determined to permanently erase all traces of past 
users from both your database and your mind. The only users you can safely
remove from your database are those users who never added contacts, activ-
ities, notes, or histories. You might also have other users who no longer need
to be associated with specific contacts, activities, notes, or histories. ACT!,
being the smart program that you’ve grown to know and love, allows you to
delete a user while preserving the information (notes, histories, and so on)
associated with him by reassigning those items to another user.
Follow these steps to remove a user from your database:
1. Choose Tools➪Manage Users from any ACT! view.
The Manage Users dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-1).
248
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. Select the name of the user whom you want to remove from your 
database.
3. Click Delete User.
This is where ACT! shows its true colors — and in fact shows off a little.
When you choose to delete a user, one of two things happens:
• If the user never created any information, you receive two message
windows. The first asks whether you really want to remove the
user. If you answer Yes, the contact is no longer a user. The second
dialog box asks whether you want to retain this user as a contact.
If you answer Yes, the user can no longer be one of the contacts in
your database.
• If the user did enter information into ACT!, a dialog box pop ups that
looks quite a bit like the one you see in Figure 16-3. If you select
Delete Records Belonging to This User, you in essence say adios
to all contact records and associated data including notes and his-
tory — no matter who entered that data. You’ll also be deleting 
any notes, and activities created by that user. A safer choice is to
choose the Reassign Records to Another User option; you retain 
all the contacts, notes, histories, and activities created by the user,
and the other user’s name is now assigned to them.
After you reassign contact records to a new user, you can’t reverse the
process. From here on, the notes, histories, and contacts that the deleted
user created appear to have been created by the new user. However, if you
simply delete a user without reassigning his records, you risk losing a lot of
contact information. If you don’t want that to happen, I recommend simply
removing the former user’s login privileges.
Figure 16-3:
Deleting a
user with
attached
data.
249
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

Rather than deleting a user of your database, you might consider changing
the Record Manager field for all contacts that were associated with the old
user to reflect the Record Manager they are now associated with. Skip over to
Chapter 15 to find out how you can change the field data for a whole bunch of
contacts at once.
Contact Access
The Premium edition of ACT! includes a neat little party trick: the ability to
assign record level access. Simply, record level access refers to who can see 
a record. A Database Administrator or Manager can set a record access level
preference for contacts, groups, and opportunities.
The three levels of access are
 Public: These records are available for the whole world — or at least the
users of your database — to see.
 Private: These records are visible only to the user who created the
record.
 Limited Access: Selected users and/or teams of users have the pleasure
of viewing these records.
Here are two good reasons why you’d want to limit access to the various
records in your database:
 Users might feel more comfortable working with only their own con-
tacts. By removing access to other contacts, they virtually work in their
own little world — or in this case, database.
 As hard as it may be to imagine, management might feel somewhat 
protective about the records in their database. They might have night-
mares about some of their salespeople walking out the door and into 
the offices of a competitor with the contents of the company database
firmly in hand. By limiting a user to only the contact’s that he’s devel-
oped or working with, you eliminate the chance that the rest of the 
database could end up in enemy territory.
Creating a team
If you have many users in your database, you’ll probably want to divide your
users into teams. After you create a team of users, you can assign as many
records as you want to that team. The members of the team can access all
records that they have been given access to; other database users won’t even
know that those records exist. Fortunately for you, this isn’t as traumatic as
250
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

choosing sides for the volleyball team back in middle school. Follow these
three easy steps to set your teams:
1. Choose Tools➪Manage Teams from any ACT! screen.
The Manage Teams dialog box appears. You’ll immediately recognize it
because it looks just like Figure 16-4.
2. Click Create Team from the Team Tasks box.
The Manage Teams window pops open. Let the games begin!  Here’s
where you can name the team and assign the players . . . er, users.
• To add one or more users: Select the users in the Available Users
list and then click the right arrow button to add the users to the
Include These Users in Team list.
• To add all available users to the team: Click the double-right arrow
button.
• To create a new user: Click Create User and follow the steps to
create a user. The new user is automatically added to the team.
3. Click Finish when you’re finished.
Assigning access rights
After you assign the players to the teams (access rights; see the preceding
section), get ready to rumble! The purpose of the game is to decide who gets
to view which contacts. You can do this on a contact-by-contact basis. This
works out well if you assign access rights to each new contact as you create it.
Figure 16-4:
Creating a
team of
users.
251
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

1. Click the Contact Info tab from the Contacts view.
In Chapter 4, you can read how to add new contacts to your database
and to fill in as many of the fields as possible. One of those fields is the
Contact Access field, as shown in Figure 16-5.
2. Select the Limited Access radio option and then click the Select
Users/Team button.
The Select Users and Teams window appears, as shown in Figure 16-6.
3. Select the Users and/or the Teams that can access the contact and then
click OK.
Although this seems pretty straight-forward, just remember that you’re
indicating who can view the contact as well as denying access to those
whom you don’t select.
As your database grows, you’ll probably find yourself outgrowing the one-by-
one method of assigning contact access. You might find yourself worrying
about the hundreds of contacts that you have to assign to the Southwestern
regional sales manager. In fact, you might start having nightmares about the
expanding Northeastern territory and the four new key personnel that were
hired to cover the area. Stop fretting! You can change the contact access for
multiple contacts just about as easily as you do it for a single contact if you
follow these steps.

252
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

1. Create a Lookup of the contacts for whom you’d like to change the
Contact Access.
I like to think of ACT! as a series of building blocks. Chapter 13 shows
you how to create new database fields; Chapter 6 shows you how to
create a lookup on any one of those fields. For example, you might be
looking for all contacts that have the word Northeast in the Territory
field. The results of your search appear in the Contact List.
2. Click Tag All to select all the records.
3. Choose Contacts➪Edit Contact Access➪Add Users/Teams.
You should be feeling a sense of déjà vu. The Add Users/Teams dialog
box appears. Although the window is slightly different than the one in
Figure 16-6, it works in exactly the same way. From here, you can select
your teams and/or users just like you did when designating the contact
access for a single user.
4. Click OK after you finish assigning the Users and/or Team that can
access the current contact lookup.
5. Click Yes in the message prompt that appears.
ACT! wants to make really, really sure that you want to change the
access rights for your current lookup so it asks you once more to con-
firm your decision. If you click No, the message prompt closes without
changing the user access.
Finding contacts by access level
Life seems good, you’re floating in the swimming pool safe in the thought that
you’ve divided all your contacts and assigned them to the appropriate users.
Suddenly the thought occurs to you that you might just want to produce a
list of the contacts that were assigned to each team. Don’t panic — here’s an
easy way to find contact records assigned to a specific access type.
1. Choose Lookup➪Advanced➪Contact by Access.
The Lookup Contacts by Access dialog box appears. Take a gander at
Figure 16-7 to see what it looks like.
2. Select your lookup preferences.
• Select an access type: Indicate here whether you’re hunting for
public, private, or limited access contacts.
• Select an Accessible To option: Indicate the user or team that has
access to the contacts.
• Select the Record Manager: Variety is the spice of life — or in this
case, the lookup. If you’re looking to find all of Joe’s contacts that
the Northwestern sales team has access to, here’s your chance.
3. Click OK to finish.

Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

Networking 101
Your mother probably taught you to share when you were a little kid. Now
that you’re grown, it’s still a good thing to share — especially when you’re
talking about a database. This section is designed for those of you who want
to place an ACT! database on an existing network of computers.
You achieve optimum performance in ACT! when using a client-server net-
work in which each computer on the network is either a client or a server.
Servers are powerful computers or processes; their purpose in life is to sit in
a back closet and hold all your data. Clients are the computers that your indi-
vidual users actually sit at trying to look busy.
Another type of network — peer-to-peer — is generally simpler but doesn’t
offer the same performance as a client-server network. A peer-to-peer net-
work doesn’t have a dedicated server; the data is stored on various comput-
ers. The network performance is directly proportional to the amount of work
being done on each computer. If the database is stored on Sally’s computer,
and Sally happens to be listening to an Internet radio station, downloading a
file or two as well as instant-messaging her best friends, you might notice a
big decrease in performance.
Getting your network ducks in order
Before you attempt to share a database across a network, digest a few tidbits
of information. Feel free to wash these tidbits down with a slice of pizza and a
beer if you’d like.
 In order to share a database, you must create this database on the com-
puter (server) that will host the shared database. 
Figure 16-7:
The Lookup
Contacts by
Access
dialog box.
254
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

 A copy of ACT! must be installed on the server and on all workstations
that will be used to access the database.
 All users must have the same version and build of ACT! 2006.
 All workstations must have full read/write access to the Database folder
and the Supplemental Files folders.
 You need to ensure that the database share properties are enabled by
choosing Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Share Database from any ACT!
screen.
Padding the workstations
After you install ACT! on both the server and the workstations, your job is
almost finished. However, you still have one last housekeeping task to accom-
plish before you can go home for the day. If you are a standalone database
user, you’d install both the ACT! program and your database onto your hard
drive. In a network installation, however, chances are that the ACT! program
is installed on your computer and the database is installed on the server.
Enter the PAD file. Not sure what a PAD file is? Keep reading.
If you create an ACT! database called Mydatabase, three files magically
appear: mydatabase.adf, mydatabase.alf, and mydatabase.pad. The
PAD file stands for pointer to ACT! database because it is quite simply a
pointer to the actual database files. Although this file is small in size, it’s 
big in stature. The PAD file doesn’t contain any data per se; its importance
lies in the fact that it lets the ACT! program know where to find the database.
In order to have ACT! perform at its very best level, make copies of the PAD
file and copy it to the workstation of every one of your ACT! users. The most
common method of copying this file to another computer is to use Windows
Explorer (or My Computer) to make a copy of the original PAD file and then
navigate through the network to paste the file to the hard drive of each
remote workstation. You also want to ensure that the remote workstation 
can access the folder hosting the original PAD file and that the remote user
has Full Control Permissions for this location.
Silently Installing ACT!
If you’re reading this chapter and really have a vendetta against your IT
person, make sure you don’t show him this section. If you’re an IT person and
your salary is directly related to the amount of moaning and complaining you
do (more moaning, meaning more money), make sure your boss never reads
this section. If you’re trying to rollout ACT! on multiple workstations, memo-
rize the following instructions — or at least know where this book is located
at all times.
255
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

Silent Installation is geek-speak for the ability of network administrators to
install ACT! on user workstations from one central location. When the admin-
istrator installs ACT!, he uses a command line that records the installation
information so that it can be used for subsequent installations. This com-
mand includes key preferences and serial number information.
The following steps are not intended for the faint of heart — or the novice
computer user. These instructions will make a lot of sense to IT people and
other assorted computer geeks. For the rest of us, this section might as well
be written in Greek!
Servicing the server
The Administrator has to complete a few steps in order to install ACT! on the
server. After all, he’s the Administrator, he’s being paid the big bucks, and
he’s got to prove that he’s worth it.
1. Make sure that .NET Framework 1.1 is installed on the server.
This is pretty straightforward. If .NET Framework 1.1 has not been
installed on the server, you can actually install it by using the following
command line:
1033dotnetfx.exe
2. Install ACT! on the server.
To install ACT!, use the following command line:
[Drive letter]:\ACTWG\setup.exe /r
/f1”c:\ISSConfig.iss”
3. Start ACT!.
The person who starts ACT! the first time must be a local Windows
administrator on the machine in order to activate ACT! because you’ll be
prompted to register and activate ACT!.
4. Create your new database.
If you need help here, feel free to flip back to Chapter 3 for a little help in
setting up a new database.
5. Set the user preferences.
The Administrator can set preferences that include the following:
• The location of personal files associated with ACT!
• The background colors and fonts for calendars, lists, and other
views
• How contact names display
• How users are notified of new e-mail messages
256
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

6. Copy the appropriate files to the Silent Install folder.
If you installed ACT! as outlined earlier in these steps, an SI folder is cre-
ated under the ACTWG folder. It should contain the SilentInst.ini
file. In addition, you want to move a couple of other items into that
folder:
• si.txt file: This contains the serial number and the error mes-
sage that displays if a problem occurs during installation. Modify
that file to contain your serial number information.
• ISSConfig.iss file
• Preferences folder: This contains the preferences that can be
deployed to the users’ machines. You’ll find that folder buried
away in
C:\Documents and Settings\[User’s folder]\Application Data\ACT\
ACT for Win 8\Preferences
Working with the workstations
Here comes the final piece of the puzzle — getting ACT! up and running on
the individual work stations. Before you start installing, you want to verify a
few things on each workstation:
 .NET Framework 1.1 must be installed on every workstation prior to
installing ACT!.
 The workstation cannot already have ACT! 2006 installed on it. You can,
however, have ACT! 6 or earlier versions installed.
 Make sure that ACT!, Outlook, Word, Excel, and Internet Explorer are
closed.
 Shut off personal firewall software.
 LanManServer must be running. To check this, choose Start➪
Control Panel➪Administrative Tools➪Services. In the Name list, click
Server and make sure that it’s running.
 SP2 or later must be installed if the operating system is Windows 2000
Professional.
You’re ready to run the silent install. All you have to do is use the following
command line:
[Network Drive letter]:\ ACTWG\setup.exe /s /f1” [Network Drive letter]:\ACTWG
\SI\ISSConfig.iss” /f2”c:\installation_output.log”
257
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

If you run into problems or aren’t quite sure that the installation worked, check
the file named installation_output.log at the location specified in the f2
command line parameter. Result Code = 0 means that the installation was
successful; Result Code = -3 indicates that the installation failed.
The ACT! Scheduler
As you can see throughout this chapter, the database Administrator and
Manager have a lot of responsibility. The ACT! Scheduler feature helps them
out with two of these tasks by automating them:
 Database back-up
 Database synchronization of remote databases
Administrators or Managers can access the ACT! Scheduler. Standard users
can be given permission to use the ACT! Scheduler for their remote database
if they use one. The ACT! Scheduler is actually a program that runs alongside
ACT!; if the Scheduler is running, you see an icon in your system tray, as illus-
trated in Figure 16-8. When a task is created and scheduled for a database,
the ACT! Scheduler service lets the task run whether ACT! is running or not.
Opening the ACT! Scheduler
Like just about everything else, creating a task for the ACT! Scheduler is
child’s play:
1. Choose Tools➪ACT! Scheduler.
If you already see the ACT! Scheduler icon in your system tray, feel free
to right-click it and choose Open ACT! Scheduler. In either case, the ACT!
Scheduler opens just like you asked it to do; you can check out its
appearance in Figure 16-9.
Figure 16-8:
The ACT!
Scheduler.
258
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. Click Create a Task.
The first window of the ACT! Scheduler Wizard opens up. Like many of
the other setup tasks, ACT! happily steps you through the process. All
you have to do is fill in the name and location of your database, user
name, and password. Don’t forget to click Next to continue.
3. Select the task you want to schedule and then click Finish.
This step is pretty much of a no-brainer — you have a choice of schedul-
ing a backup. If you’re working on a remote synchronized database and
the Administrator has given you his blessing, you can opt to automate
the synchronization process.
Viewing or purging the task log
Although you might just want to “set it and forget it,” double-check that your
scheduled tasks are indeed being run when scheduled. The ACT! Scheduler
creates a log file that you can view. The log file contains details of the auto-
mated tasks including the task result and a description of any errors, should
they occur. You might want to purge older entries from the log file from time
to time as well.
To view the task log:
1. Choose Tools➪ACT! Scheduler.
By golly, this opens the ACT! Scheduler; refer to Figure 16-9.
Figure 16-9:
The ACT!
Scheduler.
259
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

2. Click View Task Log.
The View Task Log page appears. Hopefully, you’ll see the date and time
that the last scheduled activity was run. However, you might also see
that one of the following situations caused your backup not to run:
• Database locked: Someone decided to lock the database at the same
time that the backup was to run. Chapter 13 mentions how to —
and who can — lock a database.
• Database schema mismatch: All databases must be on the same
release number. If you schedule the backup of a database that was
in a different release version than the one you’re currently in, the
backup cannot proceed.
• An inaccessible path: If you move the database or change the drive
mapping, the backup cannot run.
3. If desired, purge the task log by clicking Purge Log.
The Purge Log dialog box opens.
a. Select a date to delete entries occurring on or before.
b. Click OK and wish your Purge Log a fond adieu.
Importing New Information into ACT! 
You might have nothing but time on your hands and decide that the one thing
you want to do with all that time is to sit down and enter thousands of new
contacts into your database. Or, you might have lots of excess cash in your
drawer and decide to hire someone to enter thousands of new contacts into
your database. My hat is off to you, and all I can ask is that you send me a
postcard in ten years when you finish.
If you’re hoping that ACT! has an easier solution — it does! The question you
need to ask yourself is where did that data come from? I have great news for
you if your data came from any of the following sources:
 You purchased a list and received it as a download or on a disk.
 You downloaded a list from an Internet site.
 You received the list on disk/disc in conjunction with a trade show you
attended.
 Someone in your organization has kept his or her contact information in
another (gasp!) program besides ACT!.
 Another piece of software that you’re using — for example, QuickBooks —
contains a good portion of the contact information you want to have 
in ACT!.
260
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

All these situations mean that your data is in electronic format, which you
can easily import into ACT!. You get to head to the beach rather than head
for your keyboard. ACT! can easily import your information if it is currently in
one of the following formats:
 ACT! in either the current or prior versions
 Outlook
If you or someone in your organization is currently using Outlook for
contact management, you need to check out Chapter 18 to find out how
easily you can import that information into ACT!.
 dBase
 Palm Desktop
 Text-delimited
Most databases have an option to export the data. After you export the data,
you need to save the data in text-delimited format. You can easily save data in
the correct format using Excel. If you are using a relatively old program that
was written for DOS, you might not find an Export option. Not to worry — most
DOS programs allow you to print to file, which in essence is creating a text file.
To start importing information and stop spending countless hours hovering
over your keyboard, follow these steps:
1. Open the ACT! database you want to import your information into.
If you are importing another ACT! database, perform routine mainte-
nance on that database and back it up before attempting to bring in the
new data. Not sure how to perform these feats? Chapter 15 explains
them in more detail.
Before you start importing data, be sure to select the Duplicate Checking
option. This option is particularly important if you suspect that your
current database might include some of the same contacts as the
imported information. Duplicate checking merges any duplicate records
with existing ACT! records. If you don’t have duplicate checking turned
on, you might find yourself merging hundreds — or even thousands — of
duplicate records one pair at a time. Check out Chapter 3 to discover
how to turn on this preference setting.
2. Choose File➪Import.
Only Administrators and Managers have permission to import data into
the ACT! database.
Holy guacamole! A wizard helps you out; if you follow the instructions,
you have your data imported in a jiffy.
3. Click Next to continue.
The Specify Source screen of the wizard appears (see Figure 16-10).
261
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

4. Fill in the important information about your import.
• What Type of File Do You Want to Import?: Choose the file type from
the drop-down menu.
• File Name and Location: Click the Browse button to navigate to the
file that you’re importing.
• User Name and Password: If you’re importing an existing ACT! data-
base into the current database, you need to supply this informa-
tion for the old database. If you’re importing data from another
format, these options are grayed out.
5. Click Next to continue.
6. Specify the type of records you want to import and then click Next.
If you’re importing an existing database, you can choose to import con-
tact, group, or company records. If you’re importing a text file, you can
decide whether you want the imported information to appear as con-
tact, group, or company records.
The Specify Import Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 16-11.
7. Specify your import options if importing a text file and then click
Next.
Here’s where you can indicate whether your text file is in tab or comma
format and whether you want to include the header row of your import
file. The header row is the row that names each of the fields you are
importing. If you include it, you end up with a contact record whose
company name might be “company.”
The Contact Map screen of the wizard appears, as shown in Figure 16-12.
Figure 16-10:
Specifying
the source
file for data
importing.
262
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

8. Map the fields from the new information to existing fields in the ACT!
database and then click Next.
Mapping fields allows you to associate field names from the import data-
base to the corresponding fields in your current ACT! database. If the
names of the fields in your import database exactly match the names of
the fields in your current ACT! database, you’re home free. You’ll notice
in Figure 16-12 that the left side of this screen indicates the field names
of the source database you are importing; the right side indicates the
field names of your current or target database.
Blank fields in the right column are indications that the field in the left
column doesn’t import. To remedy this situation, you need to click the
drop-down arrows for all blank ACT! fields and indicate the name of the
ACT! field you want to use to hold this new data. If your ACT! database is
missing key fields, you need to add them to your database before you
Figure 16-12:
Mapping
fields for a
data import.
Figure 16-11:
Text file
import
options.
263
Chapter 16: Administering to Your Database

can import information; Chapter 13 tells you how to add fields to your
database.
After you map the fields, you can save the mapping by clicking the Save
Map button. That way, you can click the Load Map button in the future 
if you ever import another similar database. It also comes in handy to
save a map in case you have to stop the import in order to add in a few
missing fields.
You’ll notice a few arrow buttons along the top. If you click the right-
pointing arrow, you’re treated to a sneak preview of what your informa-
tion looks like after the import completes.
To make life easier on yourself, consider renaming the fields in your
import database to exactly match the names of your ACT! fields. For
example, ACT!’s main address field is labeled Address 1. Renaming the
address field in your import database to Address 1 causes the fields in
both databases to map automatically.
Don’t create new fields that might be lurking incognito in your database.
You’ll want to be very familiar with the structure of your ACT! database
before attempting an import. Many users add a Cell Phone field to their
ACT! database without realizing that a Mobile Phone field was already in
existence. Postal code, zip, and zip code are pretty much three different
ways of saying exactly the same thing.
9. Specify the merge options if importing another ACT! database into
your current one.
ACT! asks for a bit of feedback concerning what happens if a contact
record in the import database matches a contact record in your current
ACT! database. Typically, you want to merge the information together so
that the notes you entered for Nancy Wilson in your import database
combine with the notes you added for Nancy in your current ACT! data-
base. However, if you prefer, you can change the option so either
• Duplicated information isn’t imported.
• Information from the import database overrides the information in
your current ACT! database.
10. Click Finish to start your merge.
You might want to take a quick break after completing the wizard.
Depending on the number of contacts you are importing, this step can
take a while. Just make sure you keep an eye on your computer because
ACT! might run into multiple duplicate contacts and ask you whether
you want to merge them.
After importing your contacts, you can tweak them a bit. For example, you
might want to change the ID/Status field to Prospect, or the Referred By field
to Imported Database. Chapter 6 walks you through creating a lookup based
on the contact’s Create Date field, and Chapter 15 shows you how to perform
a global search and replace.

Chapter 17
ACT!ing with Synchronizations
In This Chapter
 Understanding synchronizations
 Setting up the master database
 Setting up the remote database
 Performing a synchronization
I
n past versions of ACT!, synchronization was a very delicate — and 
technical — operation. If not done correctly, you had a great chance 
of corrupting your database. The synchronization process is now much 
more streamlined. Although many steps are involved, they’re not difficult 
or complicated.
Remote users must have a way to connect their computers to the main com-
puter’s network in order to synchronize. In some cases, that involves bringing
in the remote user’s laptop and connecting it to the network. Synchronization
can also be done by connecting to the host remotely via a VPN — or if you
have the Premium version of ACT!, by the use of an IIS. Creating a VPN or an
IIS (Internet Information Services) is beyond the scope of this book; I assume
that you already have the correct info structure in place.
What in the World Is Synchronization?
To understand synchronization, you need to know the following terms:
 The master database is the main database that contains all your data.
 The remote database is a separate database being used by another user,
generally in a different location.
ACT! users commonly confuse backing up and restoring data with a true data
synchronization. If you back up your database and restore it on a remote
user’s computer, the remote user now has a carbon copy of your database.
This method works fine if the remote user doesn’t want to make any changes
to his database. However, if you both make changes to your respective data-

bases, you have no way of merging those changes. If you back up your data-
base and restore it once again to the remote user’s computer, you wipe out
any changes he made.
Synchronization means that you can make changes from either the master or
the remote database. It’s the exact same concept that’s used when you syn-
chronize your PDA to your computer. After synchronizing, changes made in
the master database are seen in the remote database and vice versa.
Why synchronize?
Here are several reasons why you want to synchronize your data:
 You want to share your database information with other remote users
in your organization and vice versa.
 Your database is located on an office server, but you need to keep
your information on a laptop for traveling purposes.
 For security purposes, you want some of your users to have access to
only portions of your database.
ACT!’s synchronization allows you to send and receive changes based on
selected contacts so that your remote user’s database contains only a
portion of the entire master database.
Chapters 22 and 23 talk about ACT! Premium for Web, the Web-based version
of ACT!. If your remote user doesn’t need to carry his database with him on a
laptop computer, consider this alternative method.
The synchronization cycle in a nutshell
Here’s what happens during the synchronization cycle:
1. Any changes that you make to your remote database are compiled into a
packet and sent back to the master database.
2. When the master database “hears” the remote database, it accepts the
changes and sends out any changes that occurred in the master data-
base that affect the remote user.
3. As other remote users sync to the master database, they can also
receive any contact changes that affect them, including ones made by
other remote users.
266
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Things that change during 
a synchronization
When you synchronize your data, you merge any changes that you make 
to your database with changes made by your remote user(s), including the
following:
 Contact information: If you change a contact’s telephone number and
the remote user changes the address, ACT! merges both changes into
the original contact record. If you change the same contact’s telephone
number and the numbers don’t match, ACT! applies the most recent
change.
 Notes and histories: If you and the remote user add notes, the contact
record now reflects all the notes and histories of both the master and
remote users.
 The Task List: Any tasks that either you or the remote users create now
appear in both the master and the remote databases. You can even
schedule an activity for your remote users.
 Calendars: Synchronization allows you to share the calendars of all the
users in your organization.
 Field definitions: If the master database has added, removed, or
changed fields, these changes are sent to the remote users.
 Drop-down lists: Changes made in the master database to field drop-
down lists are sent to remote users.
 Layouts: New or customized contact, company, and group layouts syn-
chronize with remote users.
 Templates: Letters, reports, envelopes, and labels synchronize with to
remote users.
 Attachments: All documents attached to the master and remote data-
bases synchronize.
Documents stored in your personal folders don’t synchronize.
Performing a Synchronization 
in Four ACT!s
The synchronization process consists of four parts: understanding the sync
process, setting up the master database, setting up the remote database, and
the actual sync process.
267
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

The synchronization setup must be done directly on the server. Do not
attempt to set up a synchronization using one of the workstations.
ACT! 1: Doing your homework
If your knees are shaking, just relax, take a deep breath, and plot your strat-
egy. Before bravely forging ahead and attempting to sync, you can do a little
preparation. Here are some tips that make your synchronizations run more
smoothly:
 Enter your data consistently. I know I sound like a broken record, but
this is worth repeating: Enter your data consistently. For example, if you
enter a contact’s company name as Tech Benders, Inc. and someone else
enters it as Tech Benders, you have duplicate contact records when you
synchronize data. To help enter data consistently, rely on drop-down
lists whenever possible.
 Determine which contacts to include in the remote user’s database.
This decision might involve setting up a query to identify those con-
tacts. If Joe is to receive all the contacts in the Southwest region, con-
sider adding a region field to your database — or at the very least,
identify those states included in the Southwest.
 Perform a spring-cleaning on your database. Scan for duplicate records
and clean up your database before starting the synchronization process.
Turn to Chapter 16 to do so.
 Use the same criteria to search for duplicate records. ACT! matches
contact records using a Unique ID, which is an identifier assigned to
each record in your database. If you set up the synchronization proce-
dure correctly, identical contacts in all databases have the same Unique
ID. If both you and your remote users add the same contact to your data-
bases, each contact is assigned a different Unique ID. If the Unique IDs of
two records do not match, ACT! matches duplicate records using the cri-
teria you specify. To ensure that the synchronization process doesn’t
create duplicate contact records, both databases need to use the same
criteria for determining duplicate records.
You can find out how to modify your duplicate record match criteria in
Chapter 16.
 All users must have the same product and version of ACT!. You can’t
synchronize an ACT! 2006 database with an ACT! 6 database. You also
can’t synchronize an ACT! 2006 database with an ACT! 2006 Premium
database. Make sure that all databases have the most recent release
update of ACT!:
• To display your current version, choose Help➪About ACT!
• To update your version of ACT!, choose Help➪ACT! Update.
268
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

ACT! 2: Setting up the main database
You must follow a number of steps in order to set up a remote database.
Sound like a lot of work? Don’t worry; only Administrators and Managers need
apply because other users don’t have the appropriate rights to set up syn-
chronization. And, if you are an Administrator or a Manager, you can stop
hiding under your desk; although there are a lot of steps, they are all very
easy to follow. You’ll also want to make sure that you are sitting at the server
when you set up the synchronization.
Enabling synchronization
The first thing you need to do is to turn on the synchronization. Follow these
steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-1.
2. Click the Enable Synchronization option in the Admin Tasks area and
then click Yes in the ACT! message dialog box.
Defining a sync set
The sync set is the main list of contacts that the remote user receives. An
Administrator or a Manager of the master database creates the sync set. On
the simplest level, the sync set consists of all contacts that the remote user
has permission to access. However, the Administrator might set up additional
criteria to limit the number of contacts that the remote user can access. After
you send the database out to the remote user, he has the opportunity to add
Figure 17-1:
Start
synchron-
ization here.
269
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

additional contacts that he has permission to access to his database.
Contacts that are added to the remote database by the remote user automati-
cally become part of the remote user’s sync.
Consider these key elements before creating a sync set:
 A sync set is only a starting point; remote users can add additional con-
tacts to their databases from the master database.
 A sync set can include only contact records that the remote user has
permission to access.
 A sync set always includes all the master database Record Manager con-
tacts as well as all group and company records. The groups and compa-
nies populate only those records that the remote user has access to.
 Master database Administrators and Managers can create sync sets
based on a query.
 An Administrator or a Manager can copy, edit, or delete sync sets.
 More than one remote database can use a sync set; however, each
remote database has only one sync set.
Follow these simple steps to create a sync set:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization panel opens (refer to Figure 17-1).
2. Click the Manage Sync Set option in the Admin Tasks area.
3. Click Create New Sync Set.
For the purposes of this section, I show you how to create a brand-new
sync set. Just remember that you can always go back and copy, edit, or
delete your sync set, following these same instructions.
4. Give your sync set a name, an optional description, and then click
Next.
What you decide to call the sync set is a big deal because you need to
recognize it by name later on. If the sync set consists of the contacts
used by the remote sales guys, you might name the sync set something
clever like Remote Sales Guys.
5. Select the names of the remote users who will use the sync set, click
the right-pointing arrow, and then click Next.
The remote user must be an active user of the master database, even if
he doesn’t have permission to access all records.
6. Decide on one of the following options:
• To synchronize all the available contacts to the sync users, select the
Synchronize All Available Contacts option, click Next, and then
click Finish.
270
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

• To further limit the contacts the remote user sees, select the Define
Sync Set Criteria option, click Next, and then click Create Criteria.
The Sync Set Criteria window opens, as shown in Figure 17-2.
7. Choose the criteria you want to set the sync to:
• Field type: You have only one choice of field type — Contact.
• Field Name: From the Field Name drop-down list, select one of the
available contact fields.
• Operator: From the Operator drop-down list, select one of the avail-
able items, such as Contains or Equal To (=).
• Value: From the Value drop-down list, select one of the available
items that correspond to the selected field name.
8. Click the Add to List button.
As you add a criterion, it appears in the bottom section of the window.
Notice in Figure 17-2 that I’m creating my sync set to include all contacts
in Florida that are managed by Gary Kahn.
9. To select more than one criterion, repeat Steps 7 and 8.
You might need to use the And/Or column to help you build the query.
And indicates that a contact must match all criteria; Or indicates that a
contact can match any one criterion.
10. Click the Preview button to see a list of all the contacts that match the
criteria you indicated.
You even see the total number of records that are included in the 
sync set.
Figure 17-2:
Determine
sync set
criteria.
271
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

11. When you’re happy with your results, click OK, click Next to confirm
your criteria, and then click Finish.
If necessary, you can create or edit additional sync sets or click Home to
return to the main Synchronization dialog box.
Creating the remote database
After you enable synchronization and create a sync set, you’re ready to
create the remote database(s). Depending on the access rights given to them
by the master database Administrator, the remote user might not be able to
perform various functions, such as backing up their database.
The Administrator can assign a Standard user the right to perform various
administrative functions, such as backing up the database and performing
routine maintenance. These permissions must be assigned before the cre-
ation of the remote database. Chapter 16 shows you how to assign these 
permissions.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization dialog box opens (refer to Figure 17-1).
2. Click Create Remote Database in the Admin Tasks area.
Like with most of the other ACT! tasks, you now follow a wizard through
the next several steps. Probably the hardest thing you have to do is click
Next at each juncture.
3. Give the remote database a name, click the Browse button to save the
new database to a different location if necessary, and then click Next.
ACT! database names don’t like spaces or symbols.
4. Select a sync set to use with the database and then click Next.
You see the sync set that you created waiting for you.
5. Indicate the following choices and then click Next.
• Allow database supplemental files to synchronize.
• Allow attachments to synchronize.
• Set the number of days after which the synchronization expires. This
ensures that the remote user synchronizes on a timely basis or
risks having the database expire. After a database expires, the
remote user can synchronize to the master database one last time,
at which point the master database Administrator or Manager has
to create a new remote database.
6. If you’re using ACT! Premium for Workgroups, make note of the name
of the Master computer and the port assigned to listen for incoming
syncs.
272
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Because the Premium version offers an additional sync option, choose
to sync either across the network or over the Internet. If you sync over
the Internet, you’re prompted for the computer’s external IP address.
You can find out how to ascertain the server’s IP address in Chapter 22.
7. Give the database a password (optional) and then click Finish.
This might be a good time to wander around the office complaining
about how busy you are. ACT! is going to take a moment to create the
remote database for you, and you might as well look busy!
8. Click the Home button to return to the Synchronization Panel; if nec-
essary, start all over again.
If all remote users will use the same sync set, you can skip that part and
click Create Remote Database.
9. Click Close when you finish creating all the remote databases.
10. Choose Tools➪Synchronize➪Accept Incoming Syncs.
The final step sets the master database in a wait-and-see mode. As the
Administrator, your job is almost finished. Time to sit back, pat yourself
on the back, and figure out a way to get that database to the remote user.
Delivering the remote data
The only thing you have left to do at this point is to get that new database,
along with all the associated files and attachments, out to the remote users.
But wouldn’t you know it? ACT! has solved that problem for you already.
When you create the remote database, you actually create a special backup
file; unlike a traditional backup file, this one comes with an .rdb extension.
You can simply e-mail the file to the remote user or burn it to CD and send it
via snail mail. Just don’t forget to send along the password if you used one to
create the backup!
ACT! 3: Setting up the remote database
When you set up the remote database and send it off by carrier pigeon to
your remote user, the ball is in the other guy’s court. Relax and go float in the
pool — just make sure to keep the cellphone on in case the remote user has a
question. And don’t forget the sunscreen!
Restoring the remote database
If you are the remote user, you have a few chores to do. Thankfully, none of
them are very hard. The first thing you need to do is restore the remote data-
base that the Administrator of the master database sent. This procedure
works pretty much the same way as the restore procedure that I discuss in
Chapter 15; the main difference lies in the fact that the remote database has a
different backup extension than a traditional database backup file.
273
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

Traditional ACT! backup files have a .zip extension. Remote database
backup files have an .rdb extension. Could it be that RDB stands for Remote
Database? You be the judge!
You, as the remote user, can follow these steps to set up the remote database:
1. Save the .rdb file that you receive from the master database
Administrator onto an appropriate spot on your hard drive.
My suggestion is that you jot down the location so that you don’t have
to call the Administrator and ask for help. My experience is that
Administrators get very cranky when interrupted in mid-swim.
2. Open ACT!; from any screen, choose File➪Restore➪Database.
The Restore Database window appears.
3. Select the Unpack and Restore Remote Database option and then 
click OK.
The Unpack and Restore an ACT! Remote Database window opens.
4. Click the Browse button next to the Select the Remote Database File 
to Restore field to locate the remote database (.rdb) backup file that
you saved in Step 1.
5. Click Browse to select a location to save the restored database.
If you’re not going to store the database on a network, you’ll probably
find that the default location, located in your My Documents folder, fills
the bill nicely. If you’re sharing the database, save it to a place on your
network.
6. Select the Share This Database with Other Users option if you are
sharing the database with other users.
7. Click OK.
If the database you’re restoring is password-protected, type your secret
password and click OK. Don’t know the password? Your Administrator
might just have to finish his swim and supply you with it!
After you restore the database, you can open and begin using it just like any
other ACT! database. You can also begin to synchronize your data at any
time.
ACT! 4: Synchronizing data
The remote user is the keeper of the synchronization key and the only one
who can initiate a sync. You’d think that having such a big responsibility
would entail a lot of work. Fortunately for you, it doesn’t.
274
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronize.
2. Click the Synchronize Now option.
When you synchronize the database, two things happen:
• Any changes made in the remote database now appear in the
master database.
• Any changes made in the master database associated with contact
records included in the remote user’s sync set now appear in the
remote database.
The synchronization can take a few minutes depending on the number of
changes that have been made to both the remote and the master databases.
You see an indicator bar roll across your screen and then a congratulatory
message celebrating the fact that you performed a successful synchroniza-
tion. You’re also asked to refresh your database so you don’t drive yourself
crazy looking for changes that might take a moment to appear.
Setting up automatic synchronization
In the standard edition of ACT!, the master database cannot receive sync
packets if other users are logged on to a multi-user database. Of course, one
way to get around this limitation is to come in at dawn — or stay until mid-
night — to perform your synchronization. For most of you, this option is not
what you have in mind! As the remote user, you might prefer to have ACT!
perform your synchronization automatically for you while you’re at home
snoozing.
Here’s how you set up an automatic synchronization:
1. Open the remote ACT! database.
2. Choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization dialog box opens (refer to Figure 17-1).
3. Click Set Sync Schedule in the Users Tasks area.
The Sync Schedule window opens, as seen in Figure 17-3.
4. Indicate your scheduling preferences.
• Occurs: Indicate the frequency with which you want the synchro-
nization to occur
• Occurs At: Indicate the date and time you want to commence using
the automatic synchronization
5. Click Finish.
275
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

In the standard ACT! version, you must leave both the master and remote
databases open so that synchronization updates are sent and received auto-
matically at the specified times. And only one person can access each data-
base at the time of synchronization.
Chapter 16 talks about the ACT! Scheduler, which is a feature of ACT!
Premium. If your organization uses Premium, the remote user(s) can set up
the Scheduler and have the synchronization occur even if ACT! isn’t open.
Adding contact records to a sync set
Because a sync set is created based on a query and may be used for more
than one remote user, you might find that your database is missing some 
contacts. These contacts represent people that you might have access to 
but who didn’t match the criteria the Administrator used for the sync set.
Ironically, these contacts actually reside in the remote database even though
you can’t access them.
Sound confusing? To put it a little simpler, if you find that you’re missing one
of your contacts, you can add it to the database:
1. Choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel from any ACT! screen.
The Synchronization dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-1).
2. In the User Tasks area, click Manage Subscription List.
You now see a list of all the contacts that you can access. The contacts
that are a part of the sync set are indicated with a check mark.
3. Click Add Contacts to Sync Set in the Subscription Tasks area.
The Contacts dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-4.
Figure 17-3:

276
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

4. Select the contact(s) from the list on the left, and then click the right
arrow button to add them to the remote database.
5. When you finish, click OK and then click the Finish button in the
Manage Subscription List window.
The additional contacts appear in your database after your next 
synchronization.
Maintaining the Synchronization
Wow! The worst is over. Your remote database is synching back to the master
database, and life is beautiful. But meanwhile back at the ranch — or at least
at the master database — the Administrator’s job continues. You might want
to check a few minor details from time to time. Or you might decide that the
fun is over, and you no longer want to continue syncing.
Viewing the last data synchronized
The synchronization process goes so smoothly that you might be left won-
dering what, if anything, actually synchronized. Sure enough, you can easily
determine that by creating a lookup. Here’s all you need to do:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Lookup➪Advanced➪Last
Synchronized.
The Last Synchronized window opens, as shown in Figure 17-5.
2. Specify the Lookup criteria:
• Last Session/Date Range: You can view either the last contacts syn-
chronized or the contacts that synchronized during a specific date
range.
Figure 17-4:

277
Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

• Record Type: Indicate whether you want to find contact, company,
or group records.
• Look In: Specify whether you want to find notes, opportunities, 
histories, and/or activities that changed during the last 
synchronization.
3. Click the Find Now button.
The contact records that changed during the last synchronization are
shown in the lower section of the Last Synchronized window.
4. Click the Create Lookup button.
The Contact List displays a list of all contacts that changed during the
last synchronization.
Although creating a lookup of all the recently synched contacts is generally a
job for an Administrator, remote users also have this functionality should
they feel an overwhelming desire to find out what changes other users have
made to their contacts.
Looking up the sync set lookup
As an Administrator, you probably rush through your day; chances are you
occasionally forget something: lunch, your head — or maybe the contacts
included in a sync set. You can easily create a list of all the contacts that are
part of a sync set by choosing Lookup➪Advanced➪Sync Set. The Contact List
magically appears, displaying all the contacts included in the sync set. The
difficult part is figuring out what to do for lunch!

Viewing and printing sync settings
You might want to review the sync settings of your database that were cre-
ated for each of the remote databases. Again, this feat is easy to accomplish:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The ever-familiar Synchronization dialog box appears (refer to 
Figure 17-1).
2. Click Manage Database in the User Tasks area.
The Synchronization window opens.
3. Select the name of your database and click View Settings in the User
Tasks area.
As you can see from Figure 17-6, you see the names of the master data-
bases and the remote sync set, the sync server port, and the expiration
period of the database.
4. If you want to print the results, click Print and then click Finish.
Re-creating a remote database
You might find yourself needing to send out another sync set to a remote
user. For example, a remote user might have forgotten to synchronize and
finds that his database is about to expire. Or maybe the remote user’s com-
puter died a slow and painful death and needs to be replaced. In any case,
here is a simple way to re-create a remote database:
Figure 17-6:
Displaying
the sync

Chapter 17: ACT!ing with Synchronizations

1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
2. Click Manage Database in the User Tasks area of the Synchronization
panel.
3. Select the remote database you want to re-create, click Recreate
Database, and then click Yes.
4. Click the Browse button to specify a location to save the newly re-cre-
ated database and then click OK.
ACT! whirs and hisses as it busily sets up the remote database again. ACT!
doesn’t complain about having to do this chore a second time. In fact,
you’re even rewarded with a happy message confirming that you have
indeed re-created the remote user’s database.
5. Click OK.
Stopping the synchronization process
All good things must come to an end, and so it is with your remote database.
You can sever the ties that bind the master database to the remote one of
three ways. After the synchronization stops, the only way to get it going again
is to completely create — or re-create — the remote database. The three
ways to sever the ties are
 Letting the expiration date expire: Remote databases are assigned an
expiration date when they are created. If the remote user fails to syn-
chronize during the allotted time period, the remote database can sync
to the master database one last time after the expiration date.
 From the master database: The master database can disable synchro-
nization for a remote database and optionally allow one last synchro-
nization before disabling the remote database. The remote database
receives a notification that synchronization is disabled and is allowed
one last synchronization session.
 From the remote database: A user with Administrator rights can disable
the remote database so that it no longer synchronizes to the main data-
base. After a remote database is disabled, it is no longer a remote data-
base. However, the database can still be used as a standalone database.
To disable either a master or remote synchronized database, follow these
steps:
1. From any ACT! screen , choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
2. In the Admin Tasks area of the Synchronize dialog box, click Disable
Synchronization.
3. When prompted, click Yes to disable the synchronization.

ace it. Microsoft is everywhere. Most likely, you’re running more than
one of its products on your computer. Like many other software prod-
ucts, ACT! 2006 has taken the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” philosophy.
ACT! fully integrates with four of the most popular Microsoft products —
Outlook, Internet Explorer, Excel, and Word.
Although other Microsoft products don’t fully integrate with ACT!, you don’t
need to stop using them. For example, you can easily store PowerPoint pre-
sentations on the Documents tab for easy access.
Changing Your Outlook on Life
A common misconception I hear from potential ACT! users is that they don’t
need ACT! because they’re using Outlook. You might snicker at that sugges-
tion because by now, you realize that Outlook is a PIM (personal information
manager) whereas ACT! is a true contact manager. I like to think of ACT! as
Outlook on steroids; try doing a mail merge, customize fields, or log in notes
in Outlook to see what I mean.
Still, some ACT! users find themselves needing to use Outlook for a variety of
reasons:
 His company uses Outlook to maintain the company calendar.
 She uses Outlook to keep track of personal addresses and information
that don’t belong in ACT!

Fortunately, you can use both ACT! and Outlook, but be aware of a few of the
ground rules first:
If you read the side of the ACT! box you’ll notice that ACT! will work with
Outlook versions 2000, 2002 and 2003. If you’re using an older version of
Outlook, it won’t work with any of the versions of ACT! 2006.
 You can import all your Outlook contact information — including
appointments, tasks, notes, and journal entries — into ACT!.
 You won’t see new Outlook contact information, notes, and journal
entries unless you reimport your Outlook data. You can, however, con-
tinue to synchronize your ACT! and Outlook calendars.
 Because Outlook appointments and tasks aren’t contact centric (not tied
to a specific contact’s record), imported or synchronized data appears
in ACT! associated with the My Record of the user who imported or syn-
chronized the information.
 ACT! converts your Outlook notes into one ACT! note.
 You can view all ACT! e-mail addresses in Outlook without synchronizing
or importing.
 You can view all Outlook e-mail addresses in ACT! without synchronizing
or importing.
 The ACT! e-mail client is a mirror image of the Outlook e-mail client.
Inbox folders created in Outlook are visible in ACT! and vice versa.
Importing Outlook contacts into ACT!
ACT! very nicely includes Outlook as one of its import options. After all, more
people switch from Outlook to ACT! than from ACT! to Outlook. Here’s all you
need to do to import the Outlook data:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Import.
Backing up your database is a good idea before attempting to try some-
thing as tricky as a data import. Chapter 15 explains how to create an
ACT! backup.
The Import Wizard opens with a nice welcoming screen that you can
skip by clicking Next.
2. Select Outlook as the type of data you want to import and click Next.
ACT! automatically imports your main Outlook address book. “Sub”
address books will not be imported unless you move those contacts 
into your main address book.

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

3. Specify that you want to import contact records and click Next.
Your contact records include the good stuff, such as the person’s name,
company, address, phone number, and shoe size.
4. Specify your import options and click Next.
The Specify Import Options wizard screen opens, as shown in Figure 18-1.
• Outlook Contacts: Imports your Outlook contacts into ACT!.
• Exchange Contacts: Imports your Exchange contacts into ACT! if
your company maintains an Outlook Exchange server.
• Appointments and Tasks as ACT! Activities: Converts your Outlook
appointments and tasks into ACT! activities.
• Notes as ACT! Notes: Converts your Outlook notes into ACT! notes.
• Journal Entries as ACT! Notes: Imports your Outlook journal entries
as ACT! notes.
5. Confirm the mapping of your Outlook fields to ACT! fields and then
click Next.
I personally love it when my software does most of my work for me.
ACT! has already “translated” the existing Outlook fields into ACT! fields.
For example, Outlook’s Business Address Postal Code becomes ACT!’s
Zip Code field.
6. Specify your merge options and then click Next.
The merge options let you tell ACT! what you’d like to do — replace,
ignore, or use the newest contact record (if one of your Outlook con-
tacts matches one of your ACT! contact records).
7. Click Finish.

E-mailing Outlook contacts in ACT!
The preceding section describes how to import your Outlook contacts into
ACT! and transform them into contact records. However, you can still view all
your Outlook e-mail addresses in ACT! even if you don’t import your entire
Outlook address book into ACT!.
Sending an ACT! e-mail to one of your Outlook contacts is almost too easy. All
you need to do is follow these steps:
1. Generate a new ACT! e-mail message by clicking the E-Mail icon on
ACT!’s Navigation bar and then clicking New.
The new message window appears.
2. Click the To button.
The Select Recipients dialog box opens, which looks a lot like the Select
Recipients dialog box you see in Figure 18-2.
3. Select Microsoft Outlook from the Address Book drop-down list.
You now see a list of all your Outlook contacts. To speed up the process,
you might consider typing in the first couple of letters of the person’s
first name in the Type In/Choose Name area.

Configuring Outlook to work 
with ACT!’s Address Book
Although ACT! automatically detects your default Outlook address book(s),
Outlook isn’t quite that bright. You have to tell Outlook where to find your
ACT! data. Follow these steps to do so:
1. In Outlook, choose Tools➪E-mail Accounts.
The E-mail Accounts Wizard opens.
2. Select the Add a New Directory or Address Book option and then click
Next.
3. In the Directory or Address Book Type window, select the Additional
Address Books option and then click Next.
4. Select the ACT! 2006 Address Book option and click Next.
The ACT! 2006 Address Book(s) dialog box opens, as shown in Figure
18-3. If you have multiple ACT! databases you can specify three ACT!
databases if you like.
5. Click Browse to locate and select your ACT! database in the First
Address Book section.
6. Enter your ACT! user name and password and then click OK.
If you have multiple ACT! databases you can specify them in the Second

E-mailing ACT! contacts in Outlook
After you configure Outlook to play nicely with ACT!, any e-mail addresses
that you add to ACT! can be used when sending e-mail using Outlook. You 
can even create a history of the e-mail sent using Outlook that appears on 
the contact’s History tab in ACT!.
1. Create a new message in Outlook.
2. Fill in the recipient’s name.
There are a few ways you can accomplish this. If you type in the first
couple of letters of the recipient’s first name, Outlook catches on and
completes the name for you. If you prefer, you can click the To button to
open the Select Names dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-4.
3. Select the name of your ACT! database from the Show Names from
The area.
4. Select a contact in the Type Name or Select from List search area and
click the right-pointing arrow.
To speed up the process, type the first couple of letters of your intended
recipient’s first name.

Sharing ACT! and Outlook calendars
After you bring your Outlook data into ACT! including your activities — you’ll
want to keep both your ACT! and Outlook calendars up to date by synchro-
nizing your calendars. (See the section “Importing Outlook contacts into
ACT!,” earlier in this chapter, if you still need to import your Outlook data.)
Synchronizing your ACT! and Outlook calendars
To keep your ACT! and Outlook calendars the same, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Outlook Activities➪Update
Activities.
The Update Calendars dialog box opens. Figure 18-6 shows you the vari-
ous options from which you can choose.
2. In the Update area, select the type of update you want to perform —
ACT!-to-Outlook, Outlook-to-ACT!, or a two-way sync.
3. Select a date option in the For These Dates area.
If you chose the Date Range option, select a starting and ending date.
Choosing the Today and Future option is always a good idea.
4. Click Update.
If you are using ACT!, Outlook, and a PDA, you need to make a decision as to
which program to use in order to sync your handheld device. If you attempt 
Figure 18-6:
Synchronize

290
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

to synchronize both ACT! and Outlook to your PDA, chances are quite high
that you end up with duplication of your contacts and activities. You’re safer
synchronizing ACT! and Outlook through ACT! and then synchronizing your
PDA to just one of your databases.
Removing Outlook activities from ACT!
After you synchronize your Outlook and ACT! activities, you might want to
remove them. If you realize immediately that your synchronization didn’t
work entirely as planned, you can always restore an ACT! backup. You can
also simply remove any synchronized activities.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Outlook Activities➪Remove
Activities.
The Remote Activities dialog box appears.
2. Select the appropriate option:
• To remove ACT! activities from Outlook, select the ACT! Activities
from Outlook check box.
• To remove Outlook activities from ACT!, select the Outlook
Activities from ACT! check box.
• To remove both types of activities, select both check boxes.
3. Click OK.
Choosing to remove Outlook activities from ACT! will remove only those
activities that have been added through the synchronization process. It has
no effect on Outlook activities imported to your database through importing.
Displaying Outlook activities in ACT!
You can view — or not view — your Outlook activities in ACT! in a number of
ways. Your Outlook activities appear on your Activities tab, Task List, and
even on the calendars.
Viewing Outlook activities on the ACT! Activities tab
A major difference between ACT! and Outlook is in how the two programs
schedule activities. I consider Outlook to be somewhat of a free-for-all; sched-
uled activities are not generally associated with a specific contact. Not so
with ACT!; Chapter 8 shows you how every activity must be associated with a
contact record.
Because of this difference in scheduling procedures, you don’t find your
Outlook activities on the Activities tab of an individual contact. You do, 
however, see all your Outlook activities on the Activities tab of your own 
My Record contact. Here’s how you do it:
291
Chapter 18: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

1. Display your My Record contact by choosing Lookup➪My Record.
2. Click the Activities tab.
Your Outlook activities show up as To-Do’s.
Now, here comes the really cool part: You can edit every one of those syn-
chronized activities. For example, even though all the Outlook activities
appear on the Activities tab of your own My Record, you can edit the activity
with a simple double-click and change the Schedule With person to any one
of your contacts. By doing that, the activity disappears from your own record
and reappears on the Schedule With contact’s record as though the activity
had been originally created in ACT!.
Viewing Outlook activities from ACT!’s Task List
Viewing your Outlook activities in your Task List requires some additional fid-
dling, but I know you’re up to the (Task List) task. Please, no groaning!
1. Click the Task List icon on ACT!’s Navigation bar.
The Task List opens in all its glory.
2. Click the Options button on the Task List toolbar and select Show
Outlook Tasks.
If you don’t see the Task List toolbar, just click the Show Filters button
(and read all about list filters in Chapter 5).
Viewing Outlook activities in ACT! calendars
By now, it probably comes as no surprise to you that your Outlook activities
appear magically on all your ACT! calendars. In fact, it would probably have
been a surprise if I had said that you can’t see them. Because your Outlook
activities appear on all your ACT! calendars, feel free to select Work Week,
Weekly, or Monthly from the Calendar toolbar.
Viewing ACT! activities from Outlook 
All your ACT! activities that you synchronize to Outlook are now accessible —
and editable — in Outlook. Because ACT! and Outlook activities are created
differently, your ACT! activities look a bit different when you view them in
Outlook. The main difference lies in the association between activity and con-
tact that Outlook doesn’t have — you can’t view an Outlook contact and see
all of his or her associated activities like you can in ACT!. However, an ACT!
activity opened in Outlook displays all the associated contacts in the Details
area, as you can see in Figure 18-7.

Exploring the Internet
The Internet Services button sits on the bottom of the Navigation bar. When
you click the Internet Services button, Internet Explorer opens, albeit with 
a different home page than you’re used to seeing because it opens to www.
act.com. You’ll notice that all your favorites are intact and that you can 
navigate through the Web until the cows come home.
Viewing a contact’s Web site
Because ACT! is all about contacts, it seems only logical that you might want
to view a contact’s Web site. Accomplish this feat of daring by following these
steps:
1. Click the Web site address that you entered into the contact record.
You probably already noticed that the Web site address is blue and that
when you hover the mouse over the field, your cursor turns into a point-
ing hand — indicating that this is a hot (hyper-) link. If you click the link,
you’re hurled into the exciting world of the Internet.
2. Internet Explorer launches and displays the contact’s Web site.
3. After you peruse the site and are ready to continue working in ACT!,
close the browser.

Chapter 18: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

Taking advantage of Internet Links
If you’re like me, you like to take advantage of the abundance of information
on the Internet. Even more important to me — and probably to you, too — 
is the ability to find information about contacts. As its name implies, ACT!’s
Internet Links links your contact information to a site on the Internet. Among
the most frequently used informational sites are the various Yahoo! pages
that help you find information on anything from a local weather report to dri-
ving directions and maps. By using an Internet Link in ACT!, you can access
these sites in a new, unique way: Yahoo! searches for your information based
on the information in the current contact record.
If one of your contacts is located in Boca Raton, Florida, you can go to that
contact’s record and click the Yahoo! Weather link to find the local Boca
Raton weather report. If your My Record has you listed in the city of Miami
and you’re currently on the record of a contact located in Fort Lauderdale,
the Yahoo! Driving Directions link supplies you with the driving directions to
get from Miami to Fort Lauderdale.
To use one of those links:
1. In ACT!, display the contact record containing the information that
you want to use.
2. Choose View➪Internet Services➪Internet Links.
You see a menu featuring the Internet Links installed on your computer.
3. Choose the site that you want to link to.
Depending on the site that you’re linking to, you might be asked to con-
firm the information that you’ve selected in ACT!. Internet Explorer then
displays the results; for example, if you’re looking for driving directions,
the My Record information appears on the left side of the screen, and
the contact’s information is on the right.
Internet sites are extremely volatile — here today, gone tomorrow. If an
Internet Link fails to function, maybe the site has changed its content
information or disappeared from the scene altogether.
Attaching a Web page to a contact
ACT! works in mysterious ways. After you install it, you might start to notice
remnants of it — or at least ACT! icons — sprinkled throughout your other pro-
grams. If you look carefully on the Internet Explorer icon bar, you’ll notice a
new kid — er, icon — on the block. The ACT! icon will attach the current site
that you’re viewing to a contact’s history tab. Here are a few more details:
1. Open the Web page you want to attach to an ACT! contact.
2. Click the Attach Web page to ACT! Contact icon.
294
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

If you prefer, you can also choose Tools➪Attach Web page to ACT! con-
tact. In either case, the Attach Web page to the following Contacts dialog
box opens. To make life even easier, the contact that you were viewing in
ACT! also appears, as shown in Figure 18-8.
3. Click OK.
In the event that you wish to associate a different contact with the Web
page, select one or more contacts from the Contacts to Select from area,
and then click the right arrow to move the contact name(s) into the
Selected Contacts list before clicking OK.
The details of the attached Web page display on the History tab for the selected
contact(s). You can double-click the attachment icon to open the Web page.
Excelling in Excel
At the risk of sounding like a nerd, my accounting background has turned me
into an Excel junkie. Apparently I’m not alone because ACT! supplies you with
numerous opportunities to interface with Excel.
Exporting a list to Excel
Very often, ACT! users want to export a part of their database to Excel. Perhaps
they need to get information to a non-ACT! user. Or maybe they want to manip-
ulate the data in a different way. It could be that they need to import their ACT!
information into another program, and Excel is the vehicle of choice.

If you look closely, you find hints of Excel throughout ACT! 2006. Specifically,
if you look really close to the Contact List, Group List, Company List, 
and Opportunity List icon bars, you see an icon that looks like a mini-
spreadsheet. If you hover your mouse over it for a second, you see that the
button is called Export to Excel.
296
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 
Excel, the Opportunities List, and pivot tables
Because the Opportunities List deals with num-
bers and dollar amounts, it’s probably the list
that you’ll most often want to see in Excel. And,
just like with the Contact, Group, and Company
lists, one click is all it takes.
Remember: You can list only one product in the
Product Name column of the opportunity in
either ACT! or Excel. Opportunities with multi-
ple products list the first product name followed
by an ellipsis (...).
Now here comes the cool part: When you
export the Opportunities List to Excel, your infor-
mation is automatically translated into a pivot
table and chart. According to Microsoft, “. . . in
a pivot table, each column or field in your
source data becomes a pivot table field that
summarizes multiple rows of information.” What
that means is that you get some neat-looking
charts like the one you see in the figure here —
that you can manipulate to your heart’s content.
After Excel opens with your Opportunities List,
just click the Opportunities pivot table or the
Opportunities Pivot tab to introduce yourself to
the exciting world of pivot tables! Read more
about how useful mining data with pivot tables
and charts can be in Excel Data Analysis For
Dummies by Stephen L. Nelson, Wiley.

Funnily enough, the button works exactly as you would suspect. Click it, and
Excel opens, displaying the list view that you’re currently in. Don’t see the
field you’re looking for? Does Excel show you a field you don’t want? No prob-
lemo. If you customize the list to show just the fields you want (find out how
to do that in Chapter 5), Excel displays those very same fields.
Because other programs can easily use Excel data, only Standard, Manager,
and Administrator ACT! users can export list data to Excel. An Administrator
can also remove this privilege from standard users if he gets mad at them.
Importing a product or drop-down 
list into ACT!
I’ve never figured out whether I’m lazy or smart — or a little of each.
Whatever, I love to use shortcuts to save myself valuable time. If you’re a new
user of ACT!, you might have already developed a rather lengthy Product List
in another piece of software. For example, you might have created a Price
List using Excel or created an Inventory List in your accounting software. If I
didn’t like you so much, I’d tell you to start typing, but instead I tell you how
to export that list from Excel into ACT!.
To import data into ACT!, follow these steps:
1. Save the Excel file as a tab or comma-delimited file.
2. In ACT!, choose Tools➪Define Fields➪Manage Drop-Down Lists.
3. Select the drop-down list into which you want to import the data, click
Edit Drop-Down List, and click Next.
4. Choose the Import Drop-Down List Items option.
From here, browse to the place where you save the Excel file and watch
while ACT! brings in your list of information — and saves you a lot of
typing.
Mapping ACT! fields to Excel
Another excellent ACT! feature (pun intended) is the ability to map specific
ACT! contact, group, or company fields to Excel cells. After they’re mapped,
the spreadsheet cells automatically update with the corresponding field
information when the document opens. Sound too cool to be true? Just try
following these steps:
1. Add an Excel spreadsheet to a contact by clicking the Add Document
button on the contact’s Documents tab.
297
Chapter 18: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

You’ll find the Documents tab located on the Contact view screen; you’ll
get the 411 on the topic in Chapter 5. Hopefully, you’ll pick a spread-
sheet that you routinely have to type boring information into such a
name, address, and phone numbers.
2. Click the Documents tab, select the spreadsheet, and then click Edit
Document.
The spreadsheet opens. You’ll notice that after you install ACT!, Excel is
now the proud owner of a new ACT! menu, just like the one in Figure 18-9.
If you prefer, you can attach a spreadsheet to ACT! while you’re in Excel
by choosing ACT!➪Attach to ACT!.
3. In Excel, select the Excel cell you want to map to an ACT! field.
4. Choose ACT!➪Map to Contact (or Company or Group).
The Map Fields dialog box opens. As you scroll through the list, notice
that all the ACT! fields are in it.
5. Select the ACT! field you want to map to the selected Excel field and
then click Add.
You can easily add as many fields as you want by selecting an Excel cell,
choosing an ACT! field, and then clicking the Add button to “map” the
two together. Each ACT! field name appears in angle brackets in the
Excel cell.
6. Save and close the spreadsheet when you finish.
7. In ACT!, select the spreadsheet on the Documents tab and then click
the Map to Excel button.
Sit back in wonder and amazement as your spreadsheet appears. But
wait, if you look carefully — or not even too carefully — you’ll see that
the contact’s information has been filled into all the right places.
What’s in a Word
ACT! can use Word as the default word processor (see Chapter 3 to appoint
Word as your default word processor), and you can attach Word documents
Figure 18-9:
The ACT!
menu in
Excel.

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

to the Documents tab (see Chapter 5). What you might not have noticed,
however, is that when you install ACT!, it adds an ACT! menu to Word (as
shown in Figure 18-10).
You can use Word’s ACT! menu to help you with several tasks.
Attaching a document to a contact record
Follow these steps to attach a Word document to a contact’s Document tab:
1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Attach to ACT!.
The Select Contacts window opens.
3. Select the contact you want to attach the document to and then 
click OK.
In essence, you create a link to your document. If you look carefully,
you’ll notice something new on the Documents tab — an icon that
matches the type of document you just added. So, if you add a Word
document, you see the familiar-looking Word icon smack dab in the
middle of your Documents tab as well as the name and path of the
attached file. Go ahead, make my day: Double-click the icon. The
attached document miraculously opens in all its glory.
Sending a document as an e-mail
In this age of viruses, you’re probably hesitant to send too many attachments
knowing that the recipient might not even open it. If you’re using Word to
create your documents, here’s a simple way to convert the document into the
body of an e-mail or send it as an attachment:
1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Send Email.
Figure 18-10:

menu that
appears in

299
Chapter 18: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

ACT! asks whether you want to send the Word document as an attach-
ment or use it as the body of your e-mail.
3. Chose your poison and click OK.
The Select Contacts window opens.
4. Select the contact you want to send the e-mail message to, click the
right-arrow button, and then click OK.
The New Message window appears. Wonder of wonders, it’s all set to 
go with either a Word document attachment or with the body of the
e-mail showing an amazing resemblance to the contents of your Word
document.
5. Type the subject and then click Send.
Through the wonders of modern science — or at least the wonders of
ACT! — a history of your sent e-mail appears on the contact’s History
tab.
Sending a document in a fax
If you want to fax a Word document, follow these steps:
1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Send Fax.
The Select Contacts window opens.
3. Select the contact you want to send the fax message to, click the right
arrow button, and then click OK.
Your fax software now opens. At this point, you need to follow the
instructions of your fax software with one big difference — ACT! creates
a history of your fax.
The ability to fax using ACT! is dependent on having access to fax software
and a phone line. The various options for sending a fax depend on the fax
software installed on your computer. If the fax option is grayed out, you can’t
fax because your machine lacks the proper software.
Showing ACT!’s mail merge fields
Sometimes in your zealousness, you might close the list of mail merge fields
that opens when you edit or create a template. (See Chapter 11 to find out
how to create a template.) Not to worry — getting them back is easy enough.
In Word, choose ACT!➪Show Field List. The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box
reappears — and you can continue adding fields to your template.

ACT!ing on Your Opportunities
In This Chapter
 Creating an opportunity
 Completing the sale
 Using the Opportunity List
 Tracking your opportunities through the various sales stages
I
n this chapter, I lead you through the entire sales process using ACT!. I
show you how to create an initial opportunity, make changes to it as a sale
makes its way through the sales funnel, and view your opportunities by using
the Opportunity List and various ACT! reports.
Creating Opportunities
ACT! was originally created by a salesperson for salespeople. Ironically, many
users of the earlier versions of ACT! found the program a bit lacking when it
came to tracking sales opportunities. Happily, that is no longer the case in
ACT! 2006.
In ACT!, an opportunity is a potential sale to a contact. Each opportunity must
be associated with a contact. All sales information for a contact appears on
the Opportunities tab of the contact record. (Figure 19-1 shows an example 
of the Opportunities tab.) When you create an opportunity, you can list the
names of your products or services, specify a sales stage and forecasted
close date, and even make use of eight customizable fields. Click a button,
and ACT! generates a quote. You can even schedule a follow-up activity for
the opportunity.
By automating the sales process using ACT!, you have a better chance of clos-
ing more sales. First of all, if you follow up on your activities as I show you in
Chapter 8, you have significantly fewer contacts falling through the cracks of
your database. Secondly, you can adjust your predictions as the opportunity
moves through the sales stages. Most importantly, you can generate reports
based on your projected sales, allowing you to focus on the deals that you
think you have the best chance of closing.

Initiating the opportunity
So why are you sitting around reading a book? It’s time for you to go out there
and make some money. Here’s how you’re going to make your first million:
1. Perform a lookup to find the contact for whom you’re creating an
opportunity.
What? A little rusty on those lookups? Fear not — and head to Chapter 6
for a quick refresher.
2. Create a new opportunity by clicking the Opportunities tab and then
clicking the New Opportunity icon.
If you have a bit of trouble locating the New Opportunity icon, it’s under-
standable; it’s the icon on the Opportunities tab that looks like a graph.
You also know you’re on the right track when you hover your cursor
over the button; a ToolTip proclaiming New Opportunity shows up.
The Opportunity dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 19-2.
3. Give the opportunity a name.
After you create the opportunity, you can track it down by doing a Name
lookup, so consider assigning a name that starts with the company
name that you’re doing business with or the Purchase Order number. If
you don’t give the opportunity a name, ACT! assigns one for you auto-
matically: New Opportunity.
Figure 19-1:
The Oppor-
tunities tab.
302
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

4. Assign a sales status.
This option is a fairly simple one. All new opportunities are assigned the
Open status.
For more on the other choices here, see the upcoming section, “Closing
the deal.”
5. Assign a sales process.
Here’s where ACT! really forces you to get organized. Although not neces-
sary, you possibly have more than one Process List with your opportuni-
ties. You might use one for the pre-sales steps that you want everyone in
your organization to follow and another for the steps that you need to
follow after you land that large deal.
Each process comes with its own list of stages. Your homework is to ver-
balize your sales processes and translate them into ACT! (see Chapter 13).
Doing so keeps you organized, lets you know where you stand in the
scheme of things, and allows you to generate some useful sales reports
later on.
6. Assign a sales stage.
If you’re hearing a nagging voice in the back of your head, it’s because
I’m nagging you. An important concept in computing is Garbage In,
Garbage Out (GIGO). You want to set the sales stage so you know where
this opportunity lies in your sales pipeline and so this opportunity doesn’t
fall by the wayside. Too, you’ll want to change the stage as the opportu-
nity progresses through your sales cycle. For more information see the
following section, “Modifying the opportunity.”
Figure 19-2:
The
Opportunity
dialog box.
303
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

7. Enter a probability of closing.
This step could be rather easy because you can assign probabilities to
each sales stage when you set up the sales process. Feel free to over-
write the probability percentage based on your own hunches for each
opportunity.
8. Enter the estimated close date.
You use this information for sorting and reporting later.
All that’s left for you to do is fill in the Product/Services, User Fields, Details,
and Opportunity Info tabs — a little time consuming, but you reap the
rewards later for all your hard work now.
Product/Services tab
If you’re like most people, this part is fun. Here’s where you get to count the
cash, bill for the beans, dream of the dollars. . . . In any event, the Products/
Services tab is where you get to add all the line items for your opportunity
and sit back while ACT! crunches the numbers for you.
Although the process of adding products or services to an opportunity is
pretty straightforward, I walk you through it, just in case:
1. Choose a product or service name from the Name drop-down list.
2. Click the Add button if you’d like to add additional products.
If you’re selling a new item, scroll to the bottom of the list and click Edit
List to add it.
Chapter 13 gives you the full lowdown on creating a Product List.
3. Add an item number.
If you fill in all the appropriate item numbers when creating your
Product List, this step isn’t necessary. Or, if you don’t use item numbers,
this step isn’t necessary.
4. Enter the quantity.
5. Double-check the cost and price.
This information fills in automatically from your Product List. If the
information is incorrect, head back to the Product List to correct it. 
6. (Optional) Adjust either the adjusted price or the discount percentage.
If you’re giving this customer a special price, feel free to overwrite the
default price. If you lower (or raise!) a price, ACT! automatically calcu-
lates the discount percentage. If you prefer to tinker with the percent-
age, ACT! automatically adjusts the price.
7. Repeat Steps 1–6 as many times as necessary until your opportunity
includes all the necessary line items and then click OK.
304

User Fields tab
The User Fields tab consists of eight customizable fields. Chapter 13 explains
how you can customize those eight fields by renaming them. Maybe you’re a
manufacturer’s rep and want to indicate your eight major lines. Or you might
want to indicate the eight manufacturers you deal with. Don’t forget that you
can query and generate reports with these fields, so use them wisely. You can
check out the Opportunity dialog box’s User Fields tab in Figure 19-3.
Figure 19-3:
The User
Fields tab.
305
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities
Giving ’em a discount
You can create discounts on an item-by-item
basis by either changing the adjusted price or
the discount percentage. That works pretty well
for most situations, but you might prefer to add
the discount rate as a totally separate line item.
In order to do this, you need to add a Discount
Item entry to your Product List. Because the dis-
count amount varies, you need to manually
insert the amount of the discount each time you
create a new opportunity.
To create a discount item, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪
Define Fields➪Manage Product List➪Add.
2. Type a name for the discount, such as
Discount.
To use the discount item
1. From the Opportunities tab, add or edit an
opportunity.
2. Add a new item and choose Discount from
the Name list. If you want to make this the
bottom item, you probably want to choose
Discount as your last item.
3. In the Adjusted Price field, type in a hyphen
(–) followed by the dollar discount amount
for the order.

Chapter 1 details several of the differences between ACT! 2006 and ACT! 2006
Premium for Workgroups. One of those differences is Premium’s ability to
customize the Opportunity field’s data type so that they can include drop-
down lists or be formatted for numbers and currency.
Details tab
In general, a database consists of many fields with each containing a single
piece of information. But people are people, and sometimes storing all your
important information into a bunch of teeny, tiny fields isn’t possible. That
said, you can use the Details tab to write The Great American Novel — or at
least a few important tidbits of additional info — about your opportunity.
If the information that you want to include with the opportunity is in a docu-
ment, such as a word processing file, you can copy the text in the other appli-
cation and paste it on the Details tab.
Opportunity Info tab
By now, your mind is probably fogging over from all the information that you’re
inputting. The information on the User Fields, Details, and Opportunity Info
tabs are purely optional, albeit helpful. If your poor fingers are wearing down to
little stubs, you can always go back and complete the rest of this information
later. Figure 19-4 shows the Opportunity Info tab.
 Open Date: By default, ACT! assigns today’s date to a new opportunity.
This is where you can change it if necessary.
 Record Manager: By default, the name of the logged-on user appears as
the opportunity’s Record Manager. Feel free to change it if necessary.
Figure 19-4:

Opportunity
Info tab.

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

 Referred By: If you go by the positive reward theory — the big guys get
big thank-you gifts, and the little guys get a pat on the back — you might
just want to attribute each of your opportunities to the appropriate
source.
 Competitor: If you keep one eye on the competition, here’s where you
can do it.
Getting all your information into a sales opportunity is only half the fun. The
other half consists of sticking to your original course of action. Click the
Follow Up button. You get to set up your follow-up activity in the Schedule
Activity dialog box. You’ll notice in Figure 19-5 that ACT! inserts the opportu-
nity name and stage into the Regarding field. Then click OK. You’ve just gotta
love a program that does so much of your work for you!
At this point, you’re essentially done with creating the opportunity. Sit back
and relax a moment while ACT! does one more thing for you: create a history
of the big sales event on the contact’s History tab.
Modifying the opportunity
As your opportunity progresses, going back and modifying the sales stage is
often necessary. Again, this information appears in your various reports, so
updating your opportunities is vitally important. This process is painless and
short:
1. Find the opportunity that you want to update and open it.
You have several choices here:
Figure 19-5:
Schedule a
follow-up
activity for 
a sales
opportunity.
307
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

• Create a lookup: Create a lookup for the contact associated with
the opportunity and then click the Opportunities tab. On the
Opportunities tab, double-click the opportunity.
• Modify an opportunity: From the Opportunity List, double-click the
opportunity that you want to modify.
• Search an opportunity: From any of the ACT! screens, choose
Lookup➪Opportunities and then select one of the field choices.
For example, you can search by opportunity name, product, or
status. ACT! then scurries through your database and opens the
Opportunity List, which presents you with all opportunities that
met your search criteria. Double-click the opportunity you want to
modify.
The Opportunity dialog box opens (refer to Figure 19-2).
2. Change the information in the Stage field as necessary.
The purpose of ACT!’s opportunities is to allow you to track a potential
sale from its inception to its final outcome. You’ll probably find editing
your opportunities useful as they progress through the various sales
stages. This allows you to view any of your opportunities to assess
exactly where you stand.
3. Schedule another follow-up if necessary by clicking the Follow Up
button.
4. Click OK when you finish editing the opportunity.
The biggest challenge for many busy people is remembering to take care of
all those nagging little details. Chapter 8 focuses on the activity series. You
might consider creating a sales activity series and including “updating sales
stage” as one of the steps.
Closing the deal
When you close a sale, you can record the outcome and the closing date.
ACT! records a history on the contact’s History tab — and if you associate
the opportunity with a group or company, on the History tab for the group or
company as well.
1. Find the contact for whom you’re recording the outcome of an 
opportunity.
Step 1 in the preceding section shows you several ways to meet this
goal.
308
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

2. On the Opportunities tab, double-click the opportunity that you want
to complete.
3. Change the status to indicate the current state of the opportunity in
the Opportunity dialog box.
• Closed-Won
• Closed-Lost
• Inactive
As usual, ACT! scurries around trying to make life easier for you. If you
select one of the close options, the Opportunity Info tab pops up so you
can add a few final details.
4. Click OK.
The opportunity remains on the Opportunities tab. The status changes
to Won, Lost, or Inactive depending on the choice you made. The Actual
Close Date updates to reflect today’s date.
You Can Quote Me on That
After you create an opportunity, ACT! can convert it into a written quote for
you. The quote template actually consists of two pieces:
 quote.adt file: Word creates this. You can edit the template by chang-
ing the fonts, graphics, and wording. Typically, the .adt file contains
information about both you and your contact and can also contain dis-
claimer information.
 quote.xlt file: This Excel-created file is embedded into the .adt file. It
appears as a table in the center of a quote and contains numeric data,
such as quantity, pricing, and totals. Because of how the .xlt file is cre-
ated, you probably don’t want to make any changes to the file; doing so
can run the risk of leaving the quote generator inoperable.
Only one quote template works directly from the Opportunity dialog box. If
you create other quote templates, you can use them like a regular template
(see Chapter 11); contact information flows into them but not opportunity
information.
Because the quote template consists of both a Word document and an embed-
ded Excel table, you must have both programs installed on your computer in
order to generate quotes using ACT!. You can see a quote in Figure 19-6.
309
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

Creating a quote for an opportunity
You can literally create a quote at the click of a button. And here’s how you
find the button:
1. Open an existing opportunity.
2. Click the Quote button on the Products/Services tab.
3. If you set your preferences to prompt you for a quote number, type in
the number in the Enter Quote Number dialog window that appears
and click OK.
After a moment or so of whirring and hissing, Word opens, revealing the
quote, which is all filled out and ready to go.
Chapter 3 focuses on the various ACT! preferences settings. Buried away
in those settings is one that determines whether you’re prompted to
supply a quote number every time you generate a quote. At the same
time, you can indicate the numbers and/or letters that you want to
include in the beginning of each quote number. You find those settings
Figure 19-6:
Sample

using ACT!.
310
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

by choosing Tools➪Preferences and clicking the Quote Preferences
button of the General tab.
To change the order in which your products appear on your quote,
simply click the appropriate column heading on the Products/Services
tab of the Opportunity dialog box. To sort the products alphabetically,
click the Name column heading. Want them sorted by price? Click the
Subtotal column heading.
4. Print and save the quote as you do any other Word document.
Editing the opportunity quote template
As I mention earlier, you can’t do much fiddling with the Excel portion of the
quote template; doing so could cause your calculations to not calculate. You
can, however, modify the font if you’d like. The Word portion of the quote can
also be modified to your exacting specifications. Chapter 11 goes into greater
detail about the exciting world of template modifications, but for now, here’s
a quick refresher course. You also need to set your word processor prefer-
ence to Word in order to edit the quote.adt template; Chapter 3 shows you
how to do that.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Write➪Edit Template.
2. Choose quote.adt and then click Open.
3. Edit the template as necessary and then save it.
When you click the Quote button in the Opportunity dialog box, ACT! auto-
matically looks for the quote.adt template file. Although I advocate saving
templates and reports as other, unique names when attempting to modify
them, the same theory does not hold true for the quote template. If you
change the name, you can’t access it from the Opportunity dialog box — and
your product information doesn’t magically pour into it. Do not change the
name of the opportunity quote!
Viewing the Opportunity List
The Opportunity List provides you with a way to view all your opportunities
for all of your contacts. You can filter the Opportunity List to display only
those opportunities that match your specifications. You can then print 
the Opportunity List. Or, if you’re really ambitious, you can export the
Opportunity List to Excel where you find pivot tables waiting patiently for
you. Not sure what a pivot table is? Head to Chapter 18 for more details.
311
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

Getting to the Opportunity List is almost too easy: Just click the Opportunity
List icon on the Navigation bar. A list of opportunities appears, as you can
see in Figure 19-7. The Opportunity List even comes equipped with a status
bar running across the bottom that displays the total number of opportuni-
ties, and the weighted  and grand totals of all the opportunities. You’ll also
notice that the Opportunity List comes equipped with its very own toolbar
containing icons pertaining specifically to the Opportunity List.
Filtering the Opportunity List
If you hate to make a decision at the ice cream store, you might not appreci-
ate the Opportunity List filters. But if you’re the kind of person who loves to
have things, well, exactly the way you want them, you’re going to love the
Opportunity List!
The various filter options are located at the top of the Opportunity List
window. As you change filter options, the Opportunity List changes to include
the options you select. After this is set, you can click the Hide Filters button in
the upper-right corner of the Opportunity List. Don’t see any filters? Click the
Show Filters button that appears instead.
Figure 19-7:

312
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

Feel free to choose from the following Opportunity List filters:
 Dates: Limits the opportunities to those matching the estimated closing
date that you indicate.
 Status: Indicates whether you want to view Open, Closed-Won, Closed-
Lost, Inactive, or all opportunities. You can also choose None, which
frankly doesn’t make a whole lot of sense because then you don’t see
any of your opportunities!
 Process/Stage: If you set up more than one series of sales processes,
here’s where you indicate which one you like to see and what stage(s)
you’d like to focus on.
 Probability: Type the percent you want to use; you can find opportuni-
ties that match only a specific percentage or those that are greater than
or less than a given percentage.
 Total: Type the amount of the opportunity you want to use or choose
whether to view opportunities that are greater than or less than a given
amount.
 Select Users: Selects the names of the Record Managers associated with
the opportunities you want to view.
 Options: Actually, you have only one true filtering option here; select
Show Private to display your private opportunities. You’ll also notice the
Customize Columns option that lets you add, remove, and change the
order of your columns.
Resetting the Opportunity List filters
After you diligently work to set all your filters, you probably need to reset
them again sooner or later. You can accomplish that task in either of the fol-
lowing two ways:
 Click the Reset button from the Opportunity List.
 Choose Lookup➪Opportunities➪All Opportunities.
Printing the Opportunity List
Now comes the exciting part. Okay, it might not be your exact idea of excite-
ment, but seeing all your hard work translated onto a piece of white paper
can at least give you a nice sense of accomplishment. Remember all those
numerous opportunity fields that you so painstakingly filled? Here’s where
you get to display them in all their glory.

1. Click Quick Print (the printer icon) from the Opportunity List toolbar.
2. From the Print dialog box, click OK.
Customize your columns before printing out a copy of your Opportunity List.
I tell you how in Chapter 5.
Many of you will find the ability to transfer your Opportunity List data into
Excel at the click of a button one of the coolest of the ACT! features. You can
read more about it by flipping back to Chapter 18.
Working with Opportunity History
Chapter 7 talks about the nifty histories created by ACT! when you change
certain key pieces of contact information. You create a history for an oppor-
tunity when you create, change the status or stage, generate a quote, or
change the estimated close date. You can view the opportunity history from
the contact’s History tab. If the opportunity is associated with a group or
company, you can view the opportunity from those History tabs as well.
ACT!’s Premium version lets you customize the eight opportunity user fields.
You can also modify them to become History fields so that whatever informa-
tion you put into them is forever recorded on the History tab, even if you
change the content of one of those fields.
Okay, do you want the good news or the bad news? Well, I can’t hear your
response — and don’t you feel silly responding to an inanimate object? — 
so I give you the bad news first. You might find the histories that ACT! creates
are a bit terse. The good news is that you can edit them as much as you like
by simply double-clicking the history. The Edit History dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 19-8. Edit away to your heart’s content — after all, who said
you couldn’t change history?

Reporting on Opportunities
You poor reader, you! You work so hard in filling out the numerous opportu-
nity fields. Knowing that you need a little break, ACT! rewards you with an
abundance of sales reports and charts. Whether you need to report on a
single customer or all your current opportunities, ACT! has a way of giving
you the information.
You can monitor the opportunities that you have at each stage of the sales
development cycle and display this information in a report or graphically in 
a sales funnel or sales graph.
If you feel an overwhelming desire to chop down a few more trees in the rain
forest, ACT! can help. ACT! comes equipped with a dozen opportunity reports
to suit most of your reporting needs. Chapter 9 gives you a synopsis on all
those reports. If you don’t find a report that suits you, a few options are avail-
able to you such as printing the Opportunity List or the contact’s
Opportunities tab.
Reporting on a single contact
The Opportunities tab provides you with the sales information on any given
contact. The columns on the Opportunities tab work just like the columns 
in other ACT! areas, such as the History tab and the Contact List. You can
change their order, sort by any column, and add new columns. You can filter
the list by date and status.
You can use the information contained on the Opportunities tab to create 
a quick-and-dirty report the same way that you create a report based on 
the Contact List. ACT! prints the report in the exact same order as it appears
onscreen — that is, what you see onscreen is what you see on paper. To print
a report on a single opportunity, follow these steps:
1. Go to the contact record of the person for whom you like to track
opportunities.
2. Right-click the Opportunities tab or click the Options button.
You can use a lot of informational fields when you enter a new 
opportunity. You can portray each of these fields as a column on 
the Opportunities tab. You can customize the tab in any one of 
the following ways:
• Add a column. Select a field from the Available Fields area and click
the right-pointing arrow.
• Change the order of the columns. Select a field from the Show as
Columns in This Order area and then click the Move Up or Move
Down button.
315
Chapter 19: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

• Remove a column. Select a field from the Show as Columns in This
Order area and click the left-pointing arrow.
3. Click OK when you finish adding columns.
4. Choose File➪Quick Print Current Window.
Creating an opportunities graph
An opportunities graph can show your sales forecast or your closed sales for
a month, a quarter, or any period of time you choose. Many sales organiza-
tions prefer to see sales information in the form of a graph. As usual, ACT! is
up to the task and can create one for you in the blink of an eye — or at least
in the click of the mouse.
Here’s all you need to do to see all your opportunities translated through the
wonder of modern technology into a graph:
1. Create a lookup of contacts to include in the graph.
Need a warm-up on performing lookups? Head to Chapter 6.

Viewing the opportunity pipeline
A picture is worth a thousand words — or in this case, it might be worth
thousands of dollars! Most large sales organizations are already familiar with
the concept of a sales pipeline. The ACT! pipeline graphic represents the
number of opportunities at each stage of the sales development process. Each
section of an opportunity pipeline represents one of your pre-determined
sales stages. Opportunities that are marked as closed, or those that are miss-
ing a sales stage, are excluded.
1. Perform a lookup to find the contacts that you want to include in the
opportunity pipeline.
Although you don’t have to assign a sales stage to an opportunity, only
opportunities with assigned stages are included in the opportunity
pipeline.

As neat as the Opportunity Pipeline appears at first glance, closer examina-
tion uncovers a rather annoying fact. The graphic used in the Opportunity

Grouping Your Contacts
In This Chapter
 Understanding groups
 Creating groups
 Establishing group rules
 Putting groups to work
 Utilizing group notes and activities
I
n this chapter, I focus on a very commonly overlooked ACT! feature: the
ACT! group. What exactly is a group? Generally speaking, a group is a col-
lection of something. In ACT!, however, a group is a collection of contacts.
More specifically, a group is a semi-permanent lookup whose contact records
you assign to the group by any criteria that you want.
The contact record helps you to keep track of all activities as they relate to
an individual; the group allows you to track activities as they relate to an
entire group of contacts. Thus, when used correctly, ACT! groups provide you
with the potential to increase the overall power and efficiency of the ACT!
program.
Throughout this chapter, after explaining all the ins and outs of groups, I
show you how to create a group. I then show you how to put groups to work
so that you can enjoy all the benefits that groups have to offer. After reading
this chapter, you’ll become a real group pro — knowing when to use them
(and when not to) and how to use them to their greatest potential.
A Few Good Reasons to Create a Group
You shouldn’t just create groups willy-nilly without putting some thought into
them. If you do that, you’re liable to end up with bad groups, which consume
your time without offering any real benefits. (See the sidebar “Don’t create bad
groups!” to see what I mean.) So what exactly makes a good group, you ask?
Here are a few examples of when groups can really make life easy for you:

 Managing large projects: Groups are particularly well suited for those of
you who work on large projects. For example, if you’re building a home,
you’re involved with any number of people from building inspectors and
city officials to subcontractors, your own personnel, and the new home-
owner. Assigning all these contacts to a group allows you to easily zero
in on only those contacts involved in the project.
 Tracking real estate listings: If you’re a real estate agent or broker, set-
ting up a group for each listing allows you to track all clients that see a
particular property and to list all properties that you show to a particu-
lar client.
 Organizing your classes and seminars: If you teach classes and semi-
nars, you can set up groups to track all the attendees for each of your
classes. Then, when the time comes, you can print out class lists to
ensure that you contact all class members. You also have a clear listing
as to what classes an individual contact has taken with you.
 Focusing on a specific group of contacts: Say you went to a trade show
and came back with 75 good, solid leads — all of which you are deter-
mined to call. Your first step is to put all those leads into a group. On
Monday, you might call 20 of those leads, moving each one out of the
group as you make the call. On Tuesday, your list is down to 55 but
maybe you have the chance to call only 5 people. Wednesday finds you
putting out fires around your business, and you don’t have a chance to
continue phoning until Friday; you can easily access those remaining 50
contacts and take up where you left off.
In previous versions of ACT!, you might have relied on groups to track mem-
bers of a large company or account. If you’re using groups to track your 
companies, you can convert them into companies with a few clicks of your
mouse. Chapter 21 shows you the various ins and outs of this company 
feature. 
322
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 
Don’t create bad groups!
Here’s an example of a bad group: I once worked
with an ACT! user who had exactly 50 groups —
one for each state. He had then subdivided each
group into subgroups representing each ZIP
code within the state. This user had overlooked
the obvious — his database already contained
fields for both state and ZIP code. His groups
provided him with no more information than he
already had — and after he had put all that time
and effort into creating them.
Many ACT! users create groups to track con-
tacts for their newsletter or holiday card mail-
ings. Unfortunately, this situation is another
poor use of a group; although the user sees who
will receive the mailing, he doesn’t find out who
is not to receive the mailing. More importantly,
he doesn’t find out who fell through the cracks
and was just overlooked. Setting up a Mailing
field allows you to track all three things.

What All Groups Have in Common
In the preceding section, I provide examples of using groups that surely give
you an idea of how you can use groups for a wide range of tasks. Despite the
flexibility of groups, however, all groups share a few common elements:
 Volatility: In general, groups and the contacts within them don’t have to
be permanent. A contractor, for example, replaces subcontractors he
works with if they do a poor job. And, after that contractor completes a
house, he might no longer need to use the group that he created for the
project and may choose to delete it. Removing a contact from a group
doesn’t in turn remove the contact from the database.
 No limit to the number of groups: You’re allowed to create as many
groups as you want; your only limitation is self imposed. Working with
thousands of groups, however, is probably rather cumbersome.
 There is no limit to the number of contacts that belong to a group.
Add as many contacts to a group as you’d like.
 No limit to the number of groups a contact can belong to: Depending
on the type of groups that you set up, you might find that a contact
needs to belong to more than one group. For example, if you use groups
to help with project management, you might need to include the same
subcontractor in several groups.
 Relational cross-referencing: By creating a group, you can easily move
between the group as a whole and the individual members within the
group. From the Group Detail window, you can see a list of all the con-
tacts that belong to that group; from the Contacts Detail window, you
can see all the groups that a contact belongs to.
 Fifteen levels of subgroups: You might be working on a huge project
that requires a greater amount of micro-management and consequently
more subgroups. Maybe you’re working with the Federal Government
and want to have a group for each major governmental department sub-
divided into Agencies subdivided into Districts subdivided into cus-
tomers subdivided into . . . you get the drift!
Creating a Group
Like most of the other ACT! commands, creating groups is as easy as pie. Just
remember that planning is always the first step: If you work in a shared data-
base, all users need to agree on how to use groups before creating groups and
adding contact records to them.
323
Chapter 20: Grouping Your Contacts

A group isn’t meant to be a replacement for the ID/Status field (or any other
existing field for that matter; see the sidebar “Don’t create bad groups!”). The
ID/Status field serves to categorize each contact. For example, you might cat-
egorize each contact as a vendor, customer, or prospect using the ID/Status
field. Limit your groups to help you accomplish something that can’t be done
through the use of fields.
To create a group, simply follow these steps:
1. Display the Group Detail window by clicking the Groups icon on the
Navigation bar.
The Group Detail window should look vaguely familiar — in fact, it’s
nearly identical to the Contact Detail window. Just like the Contact Detail
window, the Group Detail window features tabs along the middle of the
screen. And, just like the Contact Detail window, the Group Detail window
allows you to choose the layout of your choice. As shown in Figure 20-1,
the only differences between the Group and Contact Detail windows are
the list of Subgroups appearing in the Subgroups field and the Hierarchy
field. If you’re creating your very first group, the screen is blank.
2. Choose Groups➪New Group.
If you prefer, you can right-click in the Group Detail window and choose
New Group. Or, feel free to click the New Group icon on the toolbar (the
third icon on the left). You can even click the Insert key on your key-
board. We aim to please!
Figure 20-1:
The Group
Detail
window.
324
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

A new group appears, which is blank and naked as the day it was born.
3. In the Group field, enter a name for the new group.
When you move to another field, the group list automatically updates
and your group is saved.
4. (Optional) Create a subgroup by right-clicking the primary group in
the Group List tree to the left of the Group Detail window, choosing
New Subgroup, and then filling in the name of the subgroup.
You can have as many subgroups per group as you like. And, you can
have up to 15 levels of subgroups; in other words, you can further divide
your subgroups into sub-subgroups. And, after you create a group, you
can go back to the scene of the crime and add a subgroup at any time.
After it’s created, you can drag a group into position under an existing
group to transform it into a subgroup or drag a subgroup to the top of
the Group List tree to make it a full-fledged group.
Understanding Group Membership
Just like there are membership levels at most clubs, groups can also have
two distinct levels of membership:
 Static: A static member is one that is more or less handpicked to go 
into a group. You might think of these members as having VIP member-
ships. These members receive a lifetime membership and are never be
removed from a group unless you specifically remove them. By default,
you can see all your static group members displayed on the Groups/
Companies tab of a contact’s Contact Detail window.
 Dynamic: A dynamic member is one that is added to a group through a
query. As long as the contact meets the query requirements, he remains
a part of the group; if he no longer matches the query, he is automati-
cally removed from the Group. The Groups/Companies tab doesn’t dis-
play dynamic group membership; you have to click the Display Dynamic
Group Membership button to see a listing of a contact’s dynamic group
membership.
Adding static group members
Here are the two ways you can add static members to a group: from the
Groups view or from the Contact Detail view. You’ll probably find the Groups
view method to be more convenient if you’re adding a whole lot of members
at one time. The Contact Detail method is best used for the stragglers that
you want to add on a contact-by-contact basis.
325
Chapter 20: Grouping Your Contacts

Adding multiple contacts to a group
To add a whole bunch of special, static members to a group, follow these
simple steps.
1. If possible, create a lookup of the potential members.
You might want to look for all contacts that you just added to your data-
base, or you can go to the Contact List and handpick those VIMs (Very
Important Members).
2. Switch to the Groups view and select the group to which you’d like to
add the new members.
3. Choose Groups➪Group Membership➪Add/Remove Contacts and then
click the Contacts button to add some contact records to your group.
If you prefer, you can also click the Add/Remove Contacts button on the
Contacts tab of the Group Detail window — or even right-click in the
Group Detail window and choose Group Membership➪Add/Remove
Contacts.
In any case, the Add/Remove Contacts dialog box appears (see 
Figure 20-2).
4. Choose Current Lookup from the Select From drop-down list.
5. Click the double right-pointing arrows to add the current lookup to
your group and then click OK.
Need to remove contacts from your group? Follow the same procedure you
follow to add a contact to a group — except that you click the left-pointing
arrow in the Add/Remove Contacts dialog box! To add a few more people to
the group, choose All Contacts from the Select From drop-down list and hunt
for those additional folks.
Figure 20-2:

326
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

Adding new contacts to a group does not remove existing members of the
group — it just adds additional members.
Adding a single contact to a group
In addition to adding or removing several contacts at a time to/from your
group, you might want to do it on a contact-by-contact basis. This is easy to
do as well.
1. If necessary, create a lookup for the contact that you want to add to a
group.
2. Click the Contacts icon on the Navigation bar to make sure you are in
the Contact Detail window.
3. Click the Groups/Companies tab.
The Groups/Companies tab is the home to both group and company
information. To make sure that you are viewing group information, make
sure that the Show Membership For drop-down list is displaying Groups
and Subgroups.
4. Click the Add Contact to Group button.
The Add Contact to Group dialog box opens.
5. Select the group to which you want to add the current contact, 
click the right-arrow button to add him/her to that group and then
click OK.
Because a contact can belong to more than one group, you can add the
contact to as many groups as you like. The contact’s Groups/Companies
tab displays the groups the contact is a member of. If you want to
remove the contact from a group, click the group name and then click
the left arrow button.
Creating dynamic group members
In the preceding sections of this chapter, I show you how using groups in
ACT! is a good thing. I show you how to add contacts to and remove them
from groups. By now, you’re probably an old group pro, qualified to receive
an Official ACT! Groupie certificate. But, like the best-laid plans of mice and
keyboards, there is one small hitch to your otherwise perfect world. What
happens if you forget to add a contact to a group?
For some of you, forgetting to add a contact to a group isn’t a life-threatening
event. In other circumstances, however, it might be absolutely crucial that all
appropriate contacts are added to the proper group. For example, what if you
send a notification to all members of a group about an important meeting,
but the CEO isn’t included in the group?
327
Chapter 20: Grouping Your Contacts

Step away from the aspirin — this problem is easily licked with the simple
creation of a group definition query. A definition query is ACT!’s way of auto-
matically adding contacts to a group based on information in specific fields.
Your group rules can be as simple as adding all contacts created by Joe Blow
to the Joe Blow Group, or they can be based on much more complex criteria,
such as All customers in the Southwest region managed by Joe, Sue, or Steve
belong in the Widgets Group.
A query runs every time you look at the Group Detail window. You create a
query based on specific field values. For example, you might set up a group
rule to find all the prospects in New York for whom Mike is the sales rep; base
your rule on the ID/Status, State, and Record Manager fields.
To set up a group definition query, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Group List from any ACT! window.
2. Select the group to which you want to add a query, right-click it, 
and then choose Group Membership➪Add/Remove Contacts➪
Edit Criteria.
The opening screen of the Group Criteria dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 20-3.
3. Fill in the criteria to use to establish group membership.
• Type: You can query on either Contact or Opportunity fields.
• Field Name: All the fields in your database are included in the
Contact or Opportunity field drop-down lists. Select the field that
determines the membership into your group.
Figure 20-3:

328
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

• Operator: Pick an operator from the drop-down list. The choices are
fairly self explanatory with options like Equals, Contains, and Ends
With. It might even make you feel like you’re playing charades!
• Value: Type in the field value you’re looking to match. If you select
the State field name, for example, the value might be FL.
4. Click the Add to List button.
Your entry now appears in the table portion of the Group Criteria dialog
box, and ACT! is ready and waiting for you to add another criterion.
5. Repeat the process until you select all the values.
For example, if you want the contact record to be in one of a series 
of states and have an ID/Status of Customer, you can add a second 
condition.
6. Change the And/Or indicator as needed.
By default, ACT! inserts an And in the And/Or column. That means that a
contact must match both criteria in order to become a member of the
group. The And/Or indicator is actually a drop-down with two choices:
And and Or. In Figure 20-3, I changed the value to Or, indicating that I was
searching for either Customers or Prospects.
If you add a second condition, the contact must match both conditions,
not one or the other. For example, if you specify values for both the City
and ID/Status fields, all members of the group have to reside in the same
city and have identical ID/Status values. The only way to avoid this sce-
nario is to change the And/Or value to Or.
The parentheses help you to group your criteria. In Figure 20-3, I’m look-
ing for contacts who are prospects or customers and reside in Florida.
7. Click the Preview button.
After a few seconds of contemplation, ACT! presents you with a list of
the contacts that match your criteria.
8. Click OK.
Take a look at the Group Detail window Contacts tab to see that all the
contacts that appeared in the preview are now members of the group.
And those contacts that didn’t meet the specifications were sent out in
the cold — or at least removed from the group.
Groups consist of both dynamic (based on a query rule) and static (manually
selected) members. When you run a group rule to establish dynamic mem-
bership, your static members will remain in the group even if they don’t
match the group query criteria.
329
Chapter 20: Grouping Your Contacts

Working with Groups
You can customize groups in the exact same way that you can customize the
Contact Detail window. You can add new fields, change the layout, and add
tabs. You can even do a special Group lookup to search for a group based on
the information in any one of the group fields that you create. For a crash
course in adding new fields, scurry to Chapter 13. For a refresher course in
customizing layouts, scamper over to Chapter 14.
After you create a group and stick a few unsuspecting contacts into it, things
really get exciting. I love to use the phrase “unleash the power of ACT!” — I
have this vision of Mr. Clean roaring out of my monitor. Okay, maybe I need to
get a life, but I feel that by correctly using groups, you can really get a lot of
bang for your buck with the ACT! program. This is how you can fool ACT! into
believing it’s a relational database. Try not to let too many people in on the
secret — it might just raise the price of the software.
Think of your groups as a program within a program. You have nearly the same
functionality that you do with the contact portion of ACT! — with one big dif-
ference: The notes, histories, activities and opportunities you create while in
the Group Detail window affect the entire group. After you set up a group, you
can add group notes, histories, activities, and opportunities for the group 
in exactly the same way you set them up for a contact. You can even attach 
a group-specific file to the group Documents tab. This is a great timesaver
because information that you input belongs to the group and doesn’t have 
to be duplicated on the contact level. You also won’t have to rack your brain
trying to remember which of the contacts in your group you attached a note to.
Using groups to schedule activities
One of the most powerful aspects of ACT! is its ability to associate a contact
with an activity. (See Chapter 8 to read more about activities in ACT!.) Many
scheduling programs allow you to design beautiful calendars; the problem is
that these calendars aren’t tied to a particular contact record. For example, if
you schedule an appointment to visit Jane Smith and forget the date of the
appointment, your only recourse is to flip through your calendar until you find
the appointment. After you met with Jane, you have no history of the appoint-
ment unless you once again search through your previous appointments.
To take this analogy one step further, suppose that you chair a special com-
mittee for your local Chamber of Commerce and need to schedule a meeting.
Scheduling the same appointment with each of the twenty-odd participants is
very time consuming. Trying to fit each committee member’s name on your
calendar isn’t very practical either. By scheduling the meeting with the
group, however, you achieve your goal without the hassle.

3. Click the Schedule Meeting icon on the toolbar.
The Schedule Activity dialog box pops open (see Figure 20-4). The name

the name of the group you are scheduling the activity with.
5. Click the Contacts button and then click Select Contacts.

Okay, I know I get overly excited about the little things in life, but to me
this is way cool. You’ll notice from Figure 20-5 that when you schedule
an activity with an entire group, your friend the hyperlink shows up in
the Schedule With column. By clicking the word multiple — which shows
up when you schedule a group activity — you’re sent to the Contact List
where you’re rewarded with all the contacts invited to the festivities. Or,
if you prefer, look on the Activities tab of any of the individual attendees;
once again, you’ll notice that multiple appears in the Scheduled With
column; click it to go to the Contact List to see the list of attendees.
Using notes with groups
If you’re wondering about the benefits of a group note, here are two good rea-
sons. First, say that your contact, Larry Lawyer, is involved in many of your
projects. You created a group for each of these projects like the good ACT!
groupie that you are. Throughout the course of several weeks, you continu-
ally converse with Larry about the various projects. Over a period of time, 
as you create more and more notes for Larry, it becomes harder and harder
to determine which notes belong to which project. By assigning a note to a
group, you can keep all of the individual project notes together.

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

Another group note benefit is laziness — which in this case, is a good thing! If
you assign a note to a group, you won’t have to create the note separately for
each of your group members. You also won’t have to scratch your head
trying to figure out which contact record you recorded the note on.
You can create a note and assign it to a specific group in three different ways.
I describe each of these ways in the following subsections.
Entering a note directly from the Group Detail window
By far, the easiest way to enter a Group note is via the Group Detail window.
Use this method when all you need to do is add a note that pertains to the
group as a whole.
1. Choose View➪Group List from any of the ACT! windows.
2. Select the name of the group for which you want to enter a note and
give it a double-click.
3. On the Notes tab, click the Insert Note icon.
If you don’t remember the drill on adding a note, you might want to read
Chapter 7.
Entering a note from the Contact Detail 
window and assigning it to the group
You can also add a group note using the Contact Detail window as your start-
ing point. The drill is just about the same as for adding a regular note, with
one extra step.
1. From the Contact Detail window, create a lookup for the contact
record of the group member for whom you want to create a new note.
Scratching your head as to how you’re going to find that contact? You
find the answers to all your lookup questions in Chapter 6.
2. On the Notes tab, click the Insert Note icon.
The Insert Note window pops open. If you want to see a real, live picture
of this window, stroll over to Chapter 7 for a better look. To edit an exist-
ing note, give the note a double-click.
3. Click the ellipsis button in the Associate With area.
For those of you who might not be acquainted with an ellipsis, it’s the
button decorated with the three little dots.
4. Select the appropriate group name, click the right-pointing arrow, and
then click OK.
333
Chapter 20: Grouping Your Contacts

Creating a group history
Another method of adding a group note is slightly more complicated than 
the other methods. So why, you might be wondering, am I including this in a
For Dummies book? The reason is that you might find yourself in a situation
where you need to designate a note as belonging to a group after you have
had some sort of interaction with the group as a whole. Besides, by now you
know that nothing in ACT! is hard once you learn the trick. Here’s how you 
do it:
1. Choose View➪Group List to see a list of all your groups.
2. Select the group you want, give it a right-click, and choose Create
Lookup.
3. From the Contact List that appears, click the Tag All button.
4. Press Ctrl+H.

Chapter 21
Joining a Company
In This Chapter
 Discovering companies
 Creating companies
 Navigating the corporate maze of divisions
 Working with companies
T
he first portion of this book focuses mainly on the contact aspect of ACT!;
after all, ACT! is considered to be a contact manager. In Chapter 20, you
can find out about groups, which (as the name implies) allows you to group
your contacts into more manageably sized pieces. The company portion of
ACT! is one that (quite frankly) not all of you will need to use. However, those
of you who work with larger companies and organizations will find this fea-
ture invaluable.
In this chapter, I lead you through setting up a company — and if necessary, a
division. I show you how to add (or remove) members of a company and how
to use the various company features. You even find out about the company
reports before all is said and done.
The 411 on Companies
Face it: Bureaucracy is alive and well and living in most civilized countries.
Actually, it probably lives in uncivilized ones as well. Your database might
contain the names of the head guy (also know as The Decision Maker), your
main point of contact, the guy who signs the checks, and the person who
actually does all the work (the Administrative Assistant). Seems easy at first,
until the head guy gets fired, the check-signer takes off for Brazil, and new
people replace them both.
In really large companies (generally those that have their own cafeteria and a
lot of cubicles), various divisions within the company often compound this
hierarchy. Fortunately, ACT! can accommodate your need to track contacts,
companies, and even divisions.

Just like navigating your way through a maze of cubicles can be intimidating,
you might be a little hesitant about learning yet another piece of the software
puzzle. Relax! A lot of similarities exist between the contact and company
portions of ACT!; you can apply most of the concepts that you know about
contacts to companies as well. For example
 You can add your own unique company fields and associated drop-down
lists (see Chapter 13).
 Companies come with a variety of modifiable layouts (see Chapter 14).
 You can add company-specific documents, notes, activities, and oppor-
tunities (see Chapters 5, 7, 8, and 19).
 ACT! provides you with various customizable company-specific reports
(see Chapters 9 and 10).
 You can view, modify, and print a list of all your companies.
 You can create company-based lookups (see Chapter 6).
 You can create a mail merge to a specific company (see Chapter 11).
Hey Dude, Where’s My Company?
Just like with contacts and groups, ACT! provides you with a whole series of
windows that help you manage your companies. Although most of these win-
dows parallel the contact and group windows, you’ll soon see that the cor-
rect usage of companies can transform ACT! into a highly effective relational
database. Although you might find navigating this maze of windows a bit 
confusing, read on and you’ll soon navigate around your companies like a
seasoned veteran.
The Companies tab
Sorry to disappoint you, but in ACT!, the Companies tab doesn’t refer to 
the boss’s decision to pick up the check for Friday night’s beer bash! The
Companies tab actually refers to one part of the Groups/Companies tab in 
the Contact Detail window. When you click the tab, you have a choice of
seeing the membership information for either the groups or the companies
that a contact is associated with. The Company List works in much the same
way in that it flips you back and forth between your groups and companies;
guess you can consider that you’re getting two tabs for the price of one!
In ACT!, you can hyperlink a contact’s company to a single company record;
you’ll learn how to do this later in the chapter. The Company tab works a bit
differently because a single contact can be a member of multiple companies.
Sound confusing? Think about it. I am linked to Tech Benders because that’s

the name of my company. But what if I were a sales rep and assigned to sev-
eral companies, all of which I like to cross-reference on my contact page? Or
what if you have a contractor in your database who works with more than
one company? Enter the Groups/Companies tab, as shown in Figure 21-1.
The Company List
The Company Detail and Contact Detail windows provide two ways you can
see company information. The Company List lets you view a list of all your
companies at one time. As with all lists, you can change the sorting order,
add or remove columns, filter the information, and print the list; feel free to
review Chapter 5 if you need a refresher course in how to do any of that.
You can access the Company List (see Figure 21-2) in a number of ways:
 Choose View➪Company List from any of the ACT! screens.
 Click the Companies icon on the Navigation bar and then click the
Company List button.
 Create a Company lookup by choosing Lookup➪Companies➪All
Companies.
If you create a lookup based on any of the individual company fields, the
resulting Company List includes only those companies that match your
search criteria.

Companies
tab.

Chapter 21: Joining a Company

Okay, you have three possible ways to get to the Company List, but I actually
use a fourth method. Chapter 3 shows you how to customize the Navigation
bar. Consider removing the Company icon from the Nav bar, which simply
takes you to the Company Detail screen of the first company as it appears
alphabetically in the Company List. Add the Company List icon, and you’re
one click away from accessing a list of your companies.
In addition to allowing you to see a list of all your companies, the Company
List allows you to accomplish various company chores, all of which you can
access by right-clicking your way to the shortcut menu. As you can see from
the shortcut menu in Figure 21-3, your options include
 Create or deleting companies and divisions
 Create a lookup on any of the company fields
 Attach notes, histories, and files to a company
 Move, which means you can demote a company to a division or promote
a division to a separate company
 Add or remove members from a company
 Export the Company List to Excel
 Customize the columns that appear in the Company List
 Print the Company List

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

After you arrive at the Company List, you might find that your visit is some-
what short-lived because you want to zoom in on one of the companies for
more details. Not a problem — just double-click the company you want to
focus on, and you’re transported lickety-split to the Company Detail window.
Knowing the juicy company details
The Company Detail window has many of the same features as the Contact
Detail window, such as its own definable fields and layouts as well as system
tabs for inserting or viewing notes, histories, activities, opportunities, and
documents. You even have a few user-defined tabs to house additional com-
pany information.
You create and manage companies in the Company Detail window. Not sure
how to get there? Just click the Companies icon on the Navigation bar or
double-click one of the company names from the Company List. If you look at
Figure 21-4, the Company Detail window looks almost exactly like the Contact
Detail window.
Because the Company Detail window is so similar to the Contact Detail
window, you might find yourself wandering dazed and confused into the
wrong window by mistake. You might think that you’re entering new con-
tacts, contact details, or contact notes when you’re actually entering new
companies, company details, and company notes. Just like checking the title
bar to assure that you are in the correct database is important, remember to
sneak a peak at the Back and Forward bar to make sure you’re in the correct
view. Believe me, the only thing worse than entering lots and lots of data is
deleting it all — and then starting all over again!

Chapter 21: Joining a Company

At first glance, the Company Detail window looks like a clone of the Contact
Detail window. A couple of major differences, however, are
 Division and Hierarchy fields: You can subdivide companies into divi-
sions; the Division field allows you to see all the divisions within a com-
pany. You can zoom into a division by double-clicking it. The Hierarchy
field indicates that you’re viewing a division; clicking the Up button
returns you to the main company.
 The Companies Tree: The Companies tree (on the left side of the screen)
displays the hierarchy of all available companies and divisions in your
database. If a plus sign appears next to a company, you can click it to dis-
play the company’s divisions.
 The Contacts tab: There is a certain symmetry here. In the Contact
Detail window, you have a Groups/Companies tab; in the Company Detail
window, you have a Contacts tab. This Contacts tab lists all the contacts
that are associated with the current company or division. The neat thing
about the Contacts tab is that you can zoom to any individual contact by
clicking the hyperlink attached to the name.
Hyperlinks
The company feature you’ll probably like the best is the ability to quickly flip
back and forth between a company and the contacts that “belong” to that
Figure 21-4:
The
Company
Detail
window.
340
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

company. This is done through a series of hyperlinks. When you indicate that
a contact is associated with a company, the company name turns to blue on
the Contact Detail window and on the Contact List; click this name, and you
arrive at the Company Detail window. From the Company Detail window, you
see a series of tabs running across the middle of the screen. You’ll be learning
how to create those hyperlinks later on in this chapter. Click the Contacts
tab, and you see a list of the contacts associated with the company. Guess
what? All the contact names appear in blue, which isn’t a decorative font
treatment. Venture forth and click a contact name; the hyperlink returns 
you safely to the Contact Detail window of the contact you clicked.
Company Housekeeping
The Company portion of ACT! is at the same time both surprisingly powerful
and surprisingly easy to use. Like anything else in life, your companies func-
tion best when you give a little thought to their care and feeding. Here are a
few of the routine tasks you need to know about.
Forming a new company
When you create a company in real life, you have to hire an attorney and sign
a bunch of papers. In ACT!, the procedure is a bit simpler, thank heavens! You
can add a new company from either the Company List or Company Detail
window.
1. Click the New Company icon on the toolbar of the Company Detail
window or the Company List.
A blank Company Detail window appears.
Adding a new company works in pretty much the same way as adding 
a new contact. When that blank screen appears, you are the proud
owner of a new, albeit blank, company. You need to start entering 
some information.
2. Fill all the necessary information into the various company fields.
3. Click the Contacts tab, click the Add/Remove Contacts button, and
then click the Contacts button in the Add/Remove Contacts dialog box.
Whew! I agree, that seems like a lot of steps, but you safely arrive at your
destination — the Select Contacts dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-5.
Type in the first several letters of the last name of the contact you want
to associate with this company.
341
Chapter 21: Joining a Company

4. Click the right-pointing arrow.
Add as many names as you like to the company.
5. Click OK when you finish.
Creating a division (or subdivision)
You might find yourself dealing with companies that vary in size from the sole
proprietor who runs his business from his backyard tree house to the Fortune
500 company with locations all around North America — or the world for that
matter. You might even find yourself working with a really super-sized corpo-
ration — like the federal government. ACT! allows you to create 15 division
levels, so you can have divisions of a company as well as divisions of your
divisions. Sound confusing? It is, but then so is the structure of many mega
corporations.
To create a new division, subdivision, sub-subdivision, or whatever, follow
these steps:
1. Display the company to which you want to add a division.
You can find a list of the companies from either the Company Detail
window or the Company List.
2. Click the New Division icon on the toolbar.
You right-clickers in the crowd can also right-click and choose New
Division from the shortcut menu. Either way, a blank Company Detail
window appears.
Figure 21-5:
Adding
contacts to
a company.
342
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

3. Enter the pertinent info for the division that you are creating.
The next time you display the original company, you see the division
you added in the Divisions field. Double-click it to land in the new divi-
sion. To add members to the division, click the Add/Remove Contacts
button on the Contacts tab and add division members just like you add
company members.
After creating a division (or subdivision), the Company Detail window is
probably your best source for navigating through the corporate maze. In the
main company window, all the divisions listed in the Divisions field along the
right side (refer to Figure 21-4). If you want to hone in on a division, just
double-click the division name; the company name and path now appear in
the Hierarchy field, and any additional subdivisions appear in the Divisions
field. You can keep drilling down through the divisions until you reach the
final subdivision or oil — whichever comes first.
Notice the Include Subdivisions option at the top of the Company List. As 
the name implies, clicking it shows you all the divisions and subdivisions.
However, the list appears in alphabetical order, so you’ll find it pretty impos-
sible to figure out which divisions belong to what company. Although you 
can perform most of these housekeeping tasks from the Company List,
chances are pretty good that you’ll eventually end up with a muddled mix 
of company, divisions and subdivisions.
Deleting a company
I almost hesitate to tell you about this feature because you could easily delete
a company by accident. The good news is that even if you delete a company,
the contacts associated with the company are still alive and well and living in
your database. The bad news is that all the information from the company
fields is lost forever — unless, of course, you have a backup!  If you don’t have
a backup, Chapter 15 will show you how to get one.
1. Select the company you want to delete in one of the following ways:
• Highlight the company or division from the Company List.
• View the company from the Company Detail window.
2. Right-click and select Delete Company.
3. Click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the selected company.
If you delete a company that contains divisions, the divisions don’t get
deleted — they get promoted to their very own companies. If your intention
is to delete a company and all its divisions, you need to delete the various
divisions before deleting the company itself.

Chapter 21: Joining a Company

Converting a group to a company
You might already be an ACT! fanatic and have recently converted from ACT!
6 to ACT! 2006. ACT! 6 users had to be content with groups because the con-
cept of companies was nonexistent at that time. You might have set up a
group that in actuality is a company. New users in the crowd might set up a
group from time to time and find that the group miraculously transformed
itself into a full-scale company. By now, you know that ACT! thinks of every-
thing, and this is just one more instance. You can easily convert a group into
a company at the click (or two) of a button by following these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose View➪Group List.
2. From the Group List, choose the group you want to convert to a 
company.
3. Right-click and choose Convert to Company.
If you prefer, you can also head up to the menu bar and choose Group➪
Convert to Company. In any case, the Convert Groups to Companies
Wizard appears.
4. Continue clicking Next until you arrive at the last screen; then click
Finish.
If you like, I can try to make these instructions a bit more difficult.
Basically the wizard is confirming that yes, you want to convert the
group into a company. By default, the group name becomes the com-
pany name, the group address now is the company address, and so 
on. Feel free to muddle in there if you want, but don’t blame me if 
your muddling efforts are successful!
After the conversion is complete, you might want to race over to the Company
List to have a look at the company you just worked so hard to create! You’ll
also notice that the original group has disappeared — or at least been replaced
by the new company.
Following the company rules
Nothing is worse than letting things slip through the cracks, and ACT! works
like a demon to prevent this from happening. Companies are only as good as
the contacts associated with them — so what happens when you forget to
link a contact to a company? Never fear, once again ACT! is here with a solu-
tion. Setting up company rules helps automate the process. That way, when-
ever you add a new contact to an existing company, the contact is
automatically linked to that company.
344
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

To set up a company rule, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add/Remove Contacts button on the Contacts tab of the com-
pany for which you’d like to create a rule.
2. Choose Edit Criteria from the Add/Remove Contacts window.
The Company Criteria dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-6, opens.
3. Indicate the criteria that you’re using to determine how the new con-
tacts are automatically linked to an existing company.
Nine times out of ten, you base the criteria on the company name, so
you fill in your criteria exactly as you see it in Figure 21-6. If you’re work-
ing with a large company with multiple offices, you might need to indi-
cate the city as well. For those of you who always prefer multiple-choice
to fill-in-the-blank exams, you can choose all the values from drop-down
lists so that you can simply select the criteria you want:
• Type: Indicate whether you want to match a Contact or an
Opportunity field.
• Field Name: Indicate the field you want to use.
• Operator: Typically, you use something like Equal To or Contains.
• Value: Indicate the name of the company or the exact verbiage you
want to match.
If this window looks vaguely familiar, you could be having flashbacks —
or remembering the Advanced Query window. Chapter 6 discusses the
Advanced Query window in full detail and will give you additional help
in creating a Company query.
4. Click the Add to List button.
Figure 21-6:

Chapter 21: Joining a Company

In general, you only add one criterion — the company’s name. However,
if you need to have more than one criterion, go ahead and add as many
as you like. The criteria that you select display in the center pane.
5. Click the Preview button to preview the contacts linked to the company.
6. Click OK when you finish.
The next time you add a new contact and indicate that he works at an
old company — or at least one of your existing ones — ACT! automati-
cally links the contact to the company.
Joining the Company Association
The beginning of this chapter concentrates on the company side of things;
you can read how to create a company and associate contacts with that com-
pany. This section looks at the individual contact and his association with a
company. As I mention earlier, there are two ways that a contact can be asso-
ciated with a company:
 Through the use of a hyperlink in the contact’s company field
 By association with a company or companies on the contact’s
Groups/Companies tab
A contact can be linked to only one company. However, a contact can be a
member of more than one company.
Hyperlinking a contact to a company
You have two important concepts to remember before linking a contact to a
company:
 You can hyperlink a contact to only one company.
 Linking a contact to a company creates a hyperlink from the contact to
the corresponding company.
Sound a bit confusing? It is, but here’s a way to simplify things. Linking a con-
tact to a company is done using the Company field on the Contact Detail
window. In general, the contact is linked to his own company.
With those concepts in hand, follow these steps to link a contact to a company:
1. Create a lookup of the contact that you want to link to a company.
346
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

2. Click the Browse button (with the ellipsis) next to the Company field
in the Contact Detail window.
The Link to Company dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-7. 
3. Select the company to which you want to link the contact and then
click OK.
If the company name on the Contact Detail window is an identical match
to one of the companies that you created, ACT! will match them up auto-
matically. If the name isn’t identical, you can type the first few letter of
the company name in the Look For field so that ACT! will automatically
scroll down the list of companies and find it for you.
The company name appears in blue, indicating that a hyperlink is cre-
ated between the contact and the company.
If you find that you no longer want the link, simply click the Browse button
again. ACT! asks you whether it’s okay to disable the link. Click OK, and it’s
history.
Adding or removing company members
Just because a contact is linked to a company doesn’t mean that he is a
member of that company. I know this seems like fuzzy logic, but this concept
ties in to the fact that a contact can be linked to only one company but can
be a member of several. You saw earlier in this chapter how you could associ-
ate a contact with a company from the Company Detail window. Here you can
see how to associate a contact to one or more companies from the Contact
Detail window.

Chapter 21: Joining a Company

Don’t worry — gaining membership to a company is easy and doesn’t require
a membership application or initiation fee. You can add new members to the
club, er, company from either the Company Detail or the Contact Detail win-
dows. After you associate contacts with a company using the Company Detail
window, start with an individual contact and sign him up as a member of the
company:
1. Create a lookup on the contact that you want to add as a member to
the company.
2. Click the Groups/Companies tab and show membership for
Companies and Divisions.
You’ll probably find that last step a bit unnecessary; I do, too. Just
remember that Groups and Companies are forced to share the same tab,
so you have to specify that you’re interested in using the Company por-
tion of the tab.
3. Click the Add Contacts to Company button.
The Add Contacts to Company window shows up, as shown in 
Figure 21-8.
4. Select the company you wish to link to the current contact, click the
right pointing arrow, and then click OK.

Working with a Company
You might want to think of a company as a mini database within a database.
The Company Detail window includes the same tabs as other views do —
Notes, History, Activities, Opportunities, and Documents. However, it has one
major difference: You can filter the Notes, History, Activities, and Opportunities
tabs to show just the information that pertains directly to the contact. This fea-
ture is very useful and powerful and gives ACT! a whole new dimension.
Jotting down a company note
The concept of company notes is a powerful but confusing one. Say you 
have 12 contacts, all associated with one company. Also assume that each 
of those contacts has an average of 20 notes that you’ve entered. If my math
is correct — and it doesn’t hurt to double-check me here — the combined
total notes for all the company members is 240. Now imagine having to sift
through all those notes looking for the one important one. Yikes! That might
take a while. Conversely, imagine your company just closed a major deal with
the other company; you’d probably find having to enter the same note 20
times, once for each member of the company, repetitious and a huge waste 
of your time. Enter the company note.
Entering a note from the Company Detail window solves both of these dilem-
mas: You don’t have to enter the note repeatedly, and you don’t have to
search through a mountain of notes to find it.
Entering a company note is as easy as 1-2-3:
1. Click the Notes tab in the Company Detail window.
2. Click the Insert Note button.
3. Fill in the details of the note and click OK.
Now comes the fun part. If you look at Figure 21-9, you’ll notice the Show For
drop-down list. Here’s where you can filter the notes to show only company-
specific notes. You have three choices from which to choose:
 All: Shows both company-specific and contact-specific notes
 Company: Shows only company-specific notes
 Company Contact: Shows only contact-specific notes
349
Chapter 21: Joining a Company

When you enter a note from the Company Detail window, you can access it
only from the Company Detail window. If you enter a note from the Contact
Detail window of a company member, you can view the note from both the
Contact Detail and Company Detail windows.
Associating a note, history, activity, 
or opportunity with a company
The final piece of the company puzzle occurs when you want to create a note,
history, activity, or opportunity with a specific member of a company and
you want to make sure that it’s easily accessible from the Company Detail
window. And, of course, you don’t want to have to plow through numerous
items just to find the specific note, history, activity, or opportunity for which
you’re looking. If you were dealing with another contact management pro-
gram, I might just tell you to take a hike; however, you’re dealing with ACT!,
so of course, I have a solution for you.
Actually, the solution is pretty easy. Any time you create a note, history,
activity, or opportunity, ACT! allows you to associate it with a company. By
doing that, you take advantage of the Company filter on the appropriate
Groups/Companies tab so that you can view just the pertinent information
that you want. I show you how to do it for an opportunity, but you can use
the same methodology when creating a note, history, or activity.

6. Click OK.
After you associate a note, history, activity, or opportunity with a company,
you can view them from the Company Detail window. Filter the History,
Activities, and Opportunities tabs exactly the same way as the Notes tab by
clicking the Show For drop-down list and selecting your desired filtering
option. And, when you quickly find just the item you’re looking for in the fil-
tered list, think of me before heading out to the pool!

Accessing the company files
Unlike the other systems tabs, you can’t filter the Documents tab. Rather, it
sits there like a giant bank vault, just waiting for your deposit. Okay, maybe
all this talk about companies has left me with dreams of Monopoly, but you
can attach as many documents as you like to the Documents tab of the
Company Detail window. This saves you having to hunt through the various
company contacts looking for the contact to whom you attached an impor-
tant file.
Getting the Company Reports
Although ACT! might not be submitting reports to the SEC for you, at times, 
it seems like it comes pretty darned close. ACT! comes out of the box with
five reports, all of which you can clone and then customize to fit your needs.
If you haven’t done so already, you can read about customizing your reports
in Chapter 10.
 Company Membership: Lists all your companies and their members.
 Company Summary: Shows the notes, histories, activities, and opportu-
nities for all companies.
 Company Comprehensive: Gives you the complete lowdown on a com-
pany. It includes all field information as well as notes, histories, activi-
ties, and opportunities.
 Company List: Provides you with a list of all your companies including
the description, phone, and toll-free numbers.
 Company Directory: Lists the regular and shipping addresses as well as
phone and toll-free numbers for each of your companies.

 Making changes to Windows
 Installing the Web-based version of ACT! 
 Sharing the database with others
U
sing an online product allows you to access, update, and share ACT!
information via the Internet. Best of all, the information is in real time.
You can perform lookups, run reports, and work on the Web-based version of
ACT! just as if you’re working back in the main office. However, you need to
make sure that your hardware — and systems administrator — are up to the
task. You’ll need to tweak Windows and then make sure your users know
where to find the database on the ’Net.
Looking Before You Leap
On paper — or at least on the side of the software box — placing a database
on the Web sounds easy. All you need in order to put your database on the
Internet for all the world (or at least your company) to see is a Web server
with Internet Information Services (IIS) installed, a licensed copy of ACT!, 
and a Web site. And configuring ACT! Premium for Web is simple if you know
all about IIS. However, for those of you who think IIS is simply a misspelling 
of is, you might want to read on.
Handling the hardware
Before you install the ACT! Premium for Web software, you need to ensure that
your hardware is up to the task. You need a server with the following specs:

 A Pentium 4 processor
 300MB of free hard drive space for the software and additional space
for the actual ACT! databases and related files
 At least 1GB of RAM
If you over ten people are coming to the party — or Web site — you
want at least 1.5GB of RAM and extra pigs-in-blankets. Accommodating
over 25 attendees requires at least 2GB of RAM and shrimp cocktail.
 A CD drive
 A high-speed Internet connection
Going on a Windows fact-finding mission
All versions of Windows are not created equal, at least when they pertain to
hosting a Web site. Some of the lesser versions — like Windows Millennium
Edition (Me) or XP Home Edition just won’t cut the mustard here. You need
one of the big guns to do the job:
 Windows 2000 Server or Small Business Server
 Windows 2003 Standard, Web or Enterprise
In addition, if you are going to have a maximum of ten concurrent (at the same
time), users you can also use
 Windows XP Professional
 Windows 2000 Professional
Installing IIS
After you have your hardware (check) and the proper operating system, you
need to start transforming your computer into a full-fledged Web server. This
is actually easier done than said if you follow these directions:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Add or Remove Programs➪Add/
Remove Windows Components➪Internet Information Services (IIS)
and then click Next.
The cool thing here is that Windows takes the guesswork out of every-
thing — and even tells you what those IIS initials stand for. You can see
the Windows Components setup screen in Figure 22-1.Your computer
will buzz along for a minute.

2. Pop in your original Windows installation disc when prompted and
then click Next.
What I like about this is that you can accomplish a very high-tech feat
with a fairly low-tech skill level.
What’s in an IP name?
Although you and I might name our computers with endearing names such as
Hal or Son of a Pitchfork, programmers think in terms of numbers and name
their computers with names such as 192.168.2.38. Guess that has a ring to it —
if you’re a computer. This name/number is a computer’s internal IP address. A
computer’s internal IP address identifies it from the other computers in your
internal network; hence, the modifier internal. Within your network, you can
assign IP addresses at random as long as each one is unique.
When you connect to the outside world, you have an external IP address. This
number identifies you to the outside world — the great big world outside your
internal network. Your external IP also has a cute name such as 67.87.243.62.
External IP addresses come in two flavors: dynamic and static. A dynamic IP
address is like a cute little toddler — it bounces around all over the place.
Your external IP address is assigned to you by your ISP (Internet service
provider) on a round-robin, first-come-first-served basis. Consequently, one
day, your name is 67.87.243.62; the next day, it’s 1.160.10.240.
Your remote users log on to your Web server using your Web server’s exter-
nal IP address. The trouble is that remote users might feel like they’re playing
a giant game of “keep away” if they have to use a different IP address every
time they want to get into ACT!. Enter the static IP address. A static IP address
doesn’t change, making life much easier for your remote users.

Chapter 22: Working with ACT! Premium for Web

Stop the IP, I want to get on
If you have a dynamic IP address, you have to get a static one or risk having
your remote users not being able to access the database. There are various
methods of obtaining a static IP:
 Check with your ISP. Surprisingly enough, if you pay your ISP a little
extra money each month, it will be most happy to accommodate you.
 Use any one of the many services that can provide you with a static IP
address for a very reasonable price — if not for free. Check out
• DynIP.com: http://dynip.com
• No-IP.com: www.no-ip.com
• DNS2Go: http://dns2go.com
Each can transform your magical number into something along the lines
of yoursite.theirsite.com.
 Register a domain if you really want to get fancy. You can substitute it
for your external IP address number so that you can go to your Web site
by using either 12.34.567.89 or mywebsite.com.
There are a number of ways to determine the external IP address of your Web
server. The easiest is to pull up your Web browser, go to one of these sites,
and jot down the number provided there:
 WhatIsMyIP.com: http://whatismyip.com
 ConfirmIP.com: www.confirmip.com
Giving Windows an Internet Makeover 
After you gather all your supplies — pencils, paper, Web server, operating
system — now’s the time to put them all together. The following steps aren’t
hard, but there sure are a lot of them. Just remember that paying attention to
the details will ensure that your installation proceeds without a hitch.
Confirming that IIS is alive and well
In the preceding section, you can read how to install IIS. However, just like
the light switch, you’ll need to turn it on if you expect it to work.
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop and choose Manage.
The Computer Management window opens, as shown in Figure 22-2.
356
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

2. Expand the Services and Applications area by clicking its plus sign.
3. Expand Internet Information Services by clicking its plus sign.
4. Expand the Web Site item by clicking its plus sign.
5. Right-click Default Web Site.
If this service isn’t running, the word Start shows up after the Default
Web Site item; right-clicking it gives you the choice of Start to start it
again. If the contextual menu includes Stop, you’re already started and
you should close the Computer Management Window.
Inviting an Internet Guest Account
An Internet Guest Account (IUSR) is a special account that you create in
Windows. The IUSR can access your Web site but not the rest of your server.
ACT! Premium for Web needs to have an IUSR set up so that it can be secure
in the knowledge that the outside world can access your database — and
only your database. The IUSR account is generally created when you install
IIS, but it’s always a good idea to check for its presence. If it’s missing, you
need to go back to the drawing board and reinstall IIS.
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop and choose Manage.
2. Expand the Local Users and Groups area by clicking its plus sign; click
the Users folder.
Figure 22-2:
The

Computer
Manage-
ment

357
Chapter 22: Working with ACT! Premium for Web

Usually, the IUSR is named after his father — which, in this case, hap-
pens to be the name of your computer. In Figure 22-3, you can see that
my Internet Guest Account is named IUSR_KSFLAPTOP.
3. Close the Computer Management window.
Making an ASP.NET of yourself
In a nutshell, ASP.NET is used to create Web pages and Web services. ASP
.NET impersonation allows outside users to access an application — in this
case, your ACT! database. With ASP.NET impersonation, IIS becomes respon-
sible for who is let into the party and who is denied admission.
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop and choose
Manage.
2. Expand the Services and Applications area by clicking its plus sign;
then click the Services folder.
3. Confirm that ASP.NET is listed as one of the services by right-clicking it.
This works exactly like the IIS service that you verify in the earlier sec-
tion, “Confirming that IIS is alive and well.” If this service isn’t running,
the word Start shows up on your right-click menu. If the contextual
menu includes Stop, you are already started, and you should close the
Computer Management Window.
Just call me APFW
The final thing you want to do is to create your own Windows user. The
bottom line is that the IUSR you create earlier in this chapter has access 
to all your Web files; the Windows user you are about to create has access 
to only the ACT! Web files.
Figure 22-3:

To create the Windows user, return once more to the scene of the crime —
the Computer Management window.
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop and choose
Manage.
2. Expand the Local Users and Groups area by clicking its plus sign; then
click the Users folder.
3. Click the Actions menu and choose New User.
The screen shown in Figure 22-4 appears. Although you can name the
user name anything your little heart desires, I would stick to something
simple and relatively nonconfusing like APFW — which is an acronym
for ACT! Premium for Web.
4. Clear the User Must Change Password at Next Logon option.
5. Assign a password to the user.
Think of a good password — just make sure you remember it again later!
To jog your memory, you have to type it in twice.
6. Click Create to create the new user.
The New User dialog window snaps shut — or at least closes with a
quiet click. You once again find yourself in the Computer Management
window, which is a good thing because you have a little more tweaking
to do.
7. Expand the Local Users and Groups area by clicking its plus sign; then
click the Groups folder.

8. Right-click the Administrators group and choose Add to Group.
The Administration Properties window opens. As the name implies, 
here you add the newly crowned ACT! Premium for Web user to the
Administrators group so that the remote has full access to all the 
database files and folders.
9. Click the Add button.
The Select Users window opens, as shown in Figure 22-5.
10. Click the Advanced button and then click Find Now.
11. Select APFW from the name list and click OK.
At this point, you are probably so excited you can hardly contain your-
self. Take a deep breath and think of that mango margarita you’re going
to be treating yourself to.

Installing ACT! Premium for Web
After you make Windows willing and able to host your database online, you
need to install ACT! Premium for Web on your Web server. This requires that
you stick the CD in the CD drive and follow the directions. If you already have
an older version of ACT! (version 6 or earlier) or version 1.0 of ACT! Premium
for Web installed on your computer, the installation wizard will mention it to
you but let you carry on anyway. If you have ACT! 2005 or 2006 installed on
your computer, ACT! won’t let you continue until you uninstall the product.
This chapter is designed to go in a very sequential order. If you haven’t already
configured Windows as described earlier in this chapter, ACT! Premium for
Web will point out the error of your ways and prevent you from continuing.
After the installation is complete, you have 30 days to register the product.
After that, you have a choice of registering or not using the product.
Opening your database
After you install ACT! Premium for Web, you need to specify the database(s)
that you want to access. You have a few options here:
 Create a new database. You’ll find this an extremely easy option because
the installation wizard asks you whether that’s what your intentions are.
A simple click of the Yes button when prompted, followed by the several
clicks of Next, Next, and Next will do the deed.
 Use an existing 2005 or 2006 database. Your easiest route here is to
first create a backup of your database and then restore it in ACT!
Premium for Web. If you’re not sure how to accomplish that feat, you
can read up on it in Chapter 15.
 Use an ACT! 6 or earlier database: This option is a bit trickier but
doable. You want to move the ACT! database on to the server and then
open it using the following instructions:
a. Choose File➪Open.
Here’s where you navigate to the place where you’ve moved your
database.
b. Chose ACT! 3-6 Database from the Files of Type drop-down list.
c. Select your database and click Open.
Just relax and put your feet up on your desk for a moment while
ACT! cheerfully converts your database for you.
361
Chapter 22: Working with ACT! Premium for Web

In most cases, the ASP.NET user is automatically given full rights to the folder
that houses both your ACT! database and all the supplemental folders.
However, it never hurts to double-check that the ASP.NET user does indeed
have full access rights to all of these folders.
Web Site Administration tool
If you’re familiar with ACT!, you’re familiar with ACT! Premium for Web. For
the Administrator accessing the database from the Web server, everything
seems to be safely in the correct place. But wait — those administrators with
sharp powers of observation might notice something new that’s been added
to the Tools menu: Web Site Administration. The database administrator will
be making use of this tool to specify the database that can be accessed over
the Internet and the name of the Windows account that will be used by the
remote users when they first log in to the server.
1. Choose Tools➪Web Site Administration.
The Web Site Administration tool opens, as shown in Figure 22-6.
2. Click the User Account tab and then click the Edit button.
The Edit User Account window appears. You’re asked to supply three
key pieces of information:
Figure 22-6:
The Web
Site Admin-
istration

362
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

• Windows Domain: You can use the drop-down arrow here to select
the domain or workgroup that hosts your ACT! database. By
default, the name of the domain or workgroup that you’re logged
into appears.
• Windows User Name: Type in the name of your ASP.NET imperson-
ation user that you set up. See the earlier section, “Making an
ASP.NET of yourself.”
• Password: Type in the password that you assigned to that user.
3. Click OK to close the Edit User Account dialog box.
4. Click the Add/Remove Database tab.
You now have to tell ACT! which database should be added to the
Virtual Directory. Don’t be scared of all the high tech language; ACT!
Premium for Web has already created the virtual directory and will be
more than happy to move any database(s) into it that you’d like. On the
Add/Remove Database tab, click the Add button to navigate to the loca-
tion of your database. After you select the database, you’re asked to
supply the database user’s name and password. When you get by the
gatekeeper with the correct credentials, the Add/Remove Database tab
looks just like Figure 22-7 — with the name of your database appearing
in the database area.
5. Click the Test button and hold your breath.
Okay, you don’t really have to hold your breath to proceed, but you
might consider crossing your fingers. You’ve worked really hard to get 
Figure 22-7:
Adding a

the virtual
directory.
363
Chapter 22: Working with ACT! Premium for Web

to this point, and now is your chance to see whether your database is
going to fly on the Internet. If the test is successful, your browser opens
up to the ACT! Premium for Web login screen, as shown in Figure 22-8. If
the test proves to be unsuccessful you’ll need to replicate all the steps
you’ve covered earlier to see if you missed one of them.
6. Close your Web browser and then close the Web Site Administration
window.
Inviting Others to the Party
If you’ve followed this chapter to this point, you’ve done a really great job
configuring your Web server to house ACT! Premium for Web — or at least
hiring the right person to configure your Web site. Now you get to reap your
rewards, harvest your fruit, and introduce your Web-based database to your
remote users.
The hardware configuration isn’t as important for the remote users as they
are for the Web server. Remote users can even be using older operating sys-
tems such as Windows 98 or Windows Me. They can even access the data-
base with an old-fashioned, dial-up connection although a higher connection
speed would certainly prove to be much faster and less frustrating.

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

Remote users do not have to install any software on their machines because
they will be accessing ACT! via their Web browsers. They do, however, need
to be using either version 5.5 or 6 of Internet Explorer.
The remote users might also have to change a few of their security settings:
 Accepting cookies (the Web type, not chocolate chip) must be enabled
in Internet Explorer.
 ACT! Premium for Web’s site should be added to the Trusted Sites Zone
so that pop-ups won’t be blocked when accessing the database.
 Two Active X security controls must be installed to use the word pro-
cessing function: TX Text and Common Dialog.
Remote users also have to make sure the following software is installed on
their machines:
 Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher
 Adobe Reader 5.0 or later
You can’t drive without a license
You need a license for every one of your remote access users. Although the
Administrator can set up as many new users as he’d like, those users can’t
log in to the database unless there are sufficient licenses to go around. If a
user is going to access the database both from the office network and over
the Internet, he needs only one license.
Logging in to ACT! Premium for Web
Remote users access ACT! Premium for Web using the external static IP
address that you determine earlier in this chapter, followed by the name of
the Virtual Directory that houses your ACT! database. A virtual directory is a
folder that houses all your Web site data; ACT! Premium for Web creates one
called APFW when you install the program. If you purchased a domain, they
might log in to http://mywebsitedomain.com/APFW, assuming that you
named your Virtual Directory APFW. Alternatively, they might log in with
something a bit more cryptic, such as http://12.34.567.89/APFW.
After you access the Web site, you’ll see the ACT! Premium for Web log in
screen, as shown in Figure 22-8.
365
Chapter 22: Working with ACT! Premium for Web

As in all versions of ACT!, you need to provide your correct user name to con-
tinue. You might also request that your Administrator assign you a password
(show him Chapter 16 if he needs a little extra help) to give you a bit more
security.
Feeling a sense of déjà vu
Some of you cynics in the crowd will dive into ACT! just looking for some
minute little differences. I’ll go ahead and make life easy for you by highlight-
ing a few of the minor distinctions between the two products:
 Administrative functions need to be done on the server. Therefore, the
File and Edit menus are missing in ACT! Premium for Web, and the Tools
menu is abbreviated.
 The Lookup menu is also missing. However, notice the Quick Lookup
feature at the top of the Navigation bar. Click the Lookup field to see a list
of all your fields to make life easier should you want to query any one of
your fields. You’ll also notice an Advanced Query option directly under it.
 Companies is now its very own menu instead of being a submenu
under the Groups menu.
 Opportunities is now its very own menu instead of being a submenu
under the Contacts menu.
 Your top menus belong to Internet Explorer and not to ACT! —
because you’re viewing your database using IE. Double-clicking won’t
work, and a right-click brings up an IE menu and not the ACT! menus.
 Reports run in HTML format.
 Word processing uses the ACT! word processor — Word is not an
option. Templates will use the .tpw extension.
 Synchronization isn’t necessary for ACT! Premium for Web users but
is still available if desired.
 The monthly calendar is not available.

gizmos that can improve ACT!’s functionality.

F
or the past 15 years, ACT! users everywhere have relied on ACT! to take
care of their contact management needs. During that same time, reliance
on the Internet has increased dramatically. Maybe you’ve contemplated using
an online calendaring system, such as the one that Yahoo! provides, just so
that you could access your calendar while away from the office. If you choose
that solution, however, you lose some of the functionality that makes ACT! so
appealing in the first place. Keeping your calendar in an online program other
than ACT! essentially cripples your power.
In this chapter, I show you some of the reasons why you might want to con-
sider the ACT! Premium for Web program. There are several huge benefits to
having your ACT! database on the Web.
ACT! Premium for Web is a totally separate version of ACT!. If you are consid-
ering using this product for your organization, you’ll want to purchase it
instead of ACT! 2006 or ACT! 2006 Premium for Workgroups.
Sharing Real-time Information 
with Users
One of the greatest strengths of ACT! is how easily you can enter notes and
other pertinent data into a database. Better still, if your database is located

on a network drive, you can share all that information with the other mem-
bers of your staff. However, many salespeople aren’t in the office on a regular
basis yet want to share updates with the home office. One way to share infor-
mation is by using a Web-based product.
Synchronization, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 17, allows you to send
and receive updated information to and from your remote users. However,
the data is only as current as when the  remote user last synchronized. There
is no need to synchronize with the ACT! Premium for Web product; users
always have the latest and greatest information available to them if they have
Internet access.
You might wonder exactly what data is shared in ACT! Premium for Web.
That’s a pretty easy question to answer — all of it! You can see your core
data, such as contact information, appointments and tasks, notes, histories,
and sales opportunity information. You can also run a report, create a mail
merge, and print labels. And if headquarters decides to make changes to the
layout, you’ll see those changes the next time you log into the database or
refresh your browser. Worried about the customized templates that you cre-
ated and want to share with your remote users? Don’t worry, they’re all
included in ACT! Premium for Web.
Accessing Your Information 
Anywhere, Anytime
ACT! Premium for Web is particularly suitable for those who spend a good
deal of time away from the office because you can see your database from
wherever your travels take you. You’ll have the luxury of accessing your data-
base from home, a hotel room, a client site, or even an airport computer
kiosk. Addicted to café macchiato grandes? You can hippety-hop to the coffee
shop and work away as you feed your caffeine addiction.
Not only does ACT! Premium for Web allow you to work where you want to,
but it also allows you to work when you want to. If insomnia sets in at 2 a.m.
from all that coffee, you could jump in your car and zip over to your office —
or you can save yourself a trip and simply fire up your home computer and
work away. (Consider setting your alarm for 3 a.m., hopping on to ACT!
Premium for Web, and adding a few strategic notes. You’ll find that this strat-
egy goes over very well with your boss, who will be impressed to see that
you are working all hours of the day and night. The possibilities are endless!)

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Viewing Data from a Network 
or the Internet
Throughout this book, you might find yourself repeatedly humming the
“Have it Your Way” theme song made popular by one of those fast-food
places a few years back. ACT! Premium for Web will help bring that song to
your lips because it allows you the best of both worlds. Unlike a competing
product that’s designed exclusively for Web access, ACT! Premium for Web
takes ACT! to the next level by allowing you to access your database across
your company’s network, remotely via the Internet, or by a combination of
both methods.
Here’s how it works. ACT! Premium for Web is installed on a server configured
for Internet Information Services (IIS). IIS, by the way, comes free with
Windows XP Professional. After installation, any member of your organization
who works from the office can access that data over your company’s network.
However, that same data can also be accessed over the Internet so that your
remote users can happily work away at the same time as your local users.
Lowering the Cost of Deployment 
and Upkeep
If you’re anything like me, you’ll want to get the most bang for your buck that
you can. This is especially true of software. The cost of a software deployment
is directly proportional to the number of users in a company. And typically the
CFO, CEO, and any other character running around your office with a similar
title wants to keep software and hardware expenditures to a minimum.
The cool thing about ACT! Premium for Web is that after you pay for your soft-
ware and any hardware that you might need to run a Web site, you’re done.
Finished. You’re completely through with paying for your database. And you
can continue to use the software year after year without additional cost. With
other online database solutions, you pay a monthly charge to keep your data-
base afloat. And those charges are per user, per database, per month. Ouch.
Avoiding Additional Costs as Your
Database Grows
Shopping for an online database program is kind of like shopping for a car —
you’d better read the fine print! With ACT! Premium for Web, after you pay for
371
Chapter 23: Ten Reasons to Use ACT! Premium for Web 

the software, your expenses are final. This is particularly important if your
database is going to grow. And believe me, as you add contacts, notes,
attached documents, and customized fields, your database is going to grow. If
you’re using ACT! Premium for Web, the only increase in size you’ll have to
worry about is your waistline. This isn’t the case with other Web-based data-
base programs. Typically, you’re charged by the size of your database — the
bigger your database, the more you pay.
Utilizing Older Computers
Many of you live by the motto, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” — particularly
when it comes to your computers. Over the years, your trusty computer has
chugged away; you’ve become comfortable with your current software and
know all the intricacies of your current hardware. Besides, the thought of
transferring all your data to a new machine is a daunting — not to mention an
expensive — proposition. However, technology will eventually catch up with
you, and you’ll find yourself lusting over that sexy new software with all
those great new features. Here’s where your pain sets in. While drooling over
that new software in the local computer store, you glance at the system
requirements and realize that your hardware just isn’t up to the task.
Although ACT! Premium for Web won’t magically replace your dog-eared com-
puter with the latest and greatest computer, it does allow you to access all
the great new ACT! features from your very own browser. As long as your old
clunker can access the Internet, you can access the latest version of ACT!.
Increasing Your Security
ACT! 2005 Premium introduced contact-level security, which means that the
database administrator can decide which contacts a particular user can (and
cannot) access. ACT! Premium for Web takes that notion a few steps further
by limiting the fields that a user can — and cannot — access. For example,
perhaps you store credit card information in your database, but you don’t
want to allow your remote users to see this information. You can provide
remote users with specific layouts that limit the fields that they can access.
Some of you might be worried about having your data on the Web. Don’t
worry — your data is perfectly secure. First of all, as I mention earlier, ACT!
Premium for Web is installed on an IIS server, which includes all kinds of neat
security devices. Secondly, access to your data is further protected by your
firewall, which sits in front of your server. Obviously, users need to know the
URL of the database to even get close to it. And finally, any intruders have to
ascertain both a user name and password in order to access the database.
372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Keeping Possession of Your Information
Many of you feel extremely protective about your data. Some of you might
have purchased your contacts; for others, those contacts represent months —
or even years — of cultivating potential customers. In either event, you don’t
want your data to walk out the door.
If you’re considering using another contact management program that’s avail-
able only online, consider this: All your hard-earned data will now reside on
someone else’s computer. And, in the event that you want to start housing
your information internally again, you might find it difficult — and costly —
to get your own information back into your fat little fists.
ACT! Premium for Web offers more benefits than that other online service
without forcing you to house your data offsite (which might be why the com-
petitor uses the word force in its name!). Your data is safe and secure, living
inside one of your own computers.
Sparing Your IT Department
Pity the poor IT person. When something goes wrong with your hardware,
you blame him. When something goes wrong with your software, you blame
him. And then, when he dons his white cape and pocket protector and rushes
to your rescue, you spew all your pent-up frustration directly upon his head.
It’s only natural that he’s not going to be particularly thrilled when you casu-
ally mention that you want all your remote salespeople to have access to
your database. He’s going to think that he has to administer a whole new
database. And that he somehow has to get that database — or databases —
shipped to the remote users. And, after those remote users get their new
databases, he has to figure out how to install software on their machines
remotely. And of course, the fact that those remote users are in a different
time zone, are constantly on the move, and barely a notch above computer-
illiterate doesn’t increase his anticipation of the project.
But wait — before your IT person jumps from the nearest window, you might
be able to talk him back in from the ledge with a couple of words of reassur-
ance. First of all, he has to administer only one database. Secondly, he doesn’t
have to ship anything by snail mail, e-mail, or carrier pigeon. He doesn’t have
to walk those remote users through any sort of software installation. In fact,
all he needs to do is send those remote users the Web site address for the
database, along with their user names and passwords.
Back at the ranch — or company headquarters — Mr. IT can do all kinds of
fun stuff, like set up passwords and user preferences, without having to deal
with his remote users. He can customize the database in exactly the same
373
Chapter 23: Ten Reasons to Use ACT! Premium for Web 

way he is used to customizing the traditional versions of ACT!. In fact, he’ll
probably love the fact that he’s in complete control of the database and won’t
have to spend his time “fixing” menus that users inadvertently lost or modi-
fied. And, best of all, he can send those remote users a copy of this book so
they’ll know how to use the database.
Working with Familiar Software
I don’t know whether it’s true that you can’t teach old dogs new tricks, but I
do know that many of us don’t like to wander too far out of our comfort
zones. For many of us, the introduction of Windows represented a giant leap
for mankind in that it introduced standardization into common computer
tasks. Switching software is a similar phenomenon; we grow accustomed to
having the software look — and act — in a certain way.
You might feel that one of the greatest ACT! Premium for Web benefits is that
if you know ACT!, you know ACT! Premium for Web. From the moment you log
on, you’ll be in familiar territory: The menus, icons, and various views look
exactly like what you’ve grown accustomed to seeing. You’ll find that you
already know how to accomplish the routine tasks because you do them in
the same way that you do in the non-Web versions of ACT!.
And guess what, folks? Almost all the information that you’ll find in this book
regarding ACT! 2006 is also applicable to ACT! Premium for Web!

f you’ve read this book to this point, you know about the various powerful
and timesaving features that you find in the ACT! program. But I believe
that you can never have too much of a good thing. With that thought in mind,
I give you ten suggestions that allow ACT! to work even better — if that’s pos-
sible. Some of my suggestions include products that are available for pur-
chase; other suggestions are free to one and all. If you’re looking for more
information about any of the items I list in this chapter, please visit my Web
site at http://techbenders.com/addons.htm. 
Hiring an Expert
I like to say that ACT! is kind of a “good news, bad news” product. The good
news is that ACT!’s MSRP is fairly inexpensive; the bad news is that ACT!’s
retail price is fairly inexpensive. Thus, you might assume that because this
software’s price is low, it’s a fairly easy product to master.
ACT! Certified Consultants like myself are continuously honing their ACT!
skills. An ACT! Certified Consultant (ACC) helps ACT! users discover the full
power of the program. In addition to showing you various tips and tricks,
consultants can help clients use the program to its fullest potential. You can
find a local consultant by choosing Help➪Service and Support➪ACT!
Consulting from any ACT! screen. 

Some ACT! consultants also have an additional certification. An ACT! Premier
Trainer (APT) can not only help you customize your database but also help
you learn how to use it. You can find a list of ACT! Premier Trainers by going
to www.act.com/partners/apt.
Joining a User Group
John Kaufman of the CRM Connection is an ACC who runs the South Denver
ACT! User Group. Regular attendees find the information that they learn there
about ACT! and ACT! add-on software invaluable. They also get tips and tricks
from other ACT! software users. Attendees find John’s User Group to be a
really great way to stay updated on new and innovative ways to use the ACT!
software for their businesses and to test-drive some of the add-ons before
actually purchasing them.
Don’t live in Denver? I run the ACT! User Group of South Florida where 75
ACT! fanACTics regularly hang out to learn more about ACT!. Don’t live in
Colorado or Florida? Don’t worry; User Groups are in virtually every state of
the union. To find a local User Group, go to http://act.com/community/
usergroups/find.
Linking Your PDA
Who doesn’t use a handheld these days? They’re great for people on the go —
and ACT! lets you take your database along with you. And, if you believe that
the best things in life are free, you’ll be happy to know that ACT! 2006 includes
both the ACT! Link for Palm OS and the ACT! Link for Pocket PC right on the
installation CD.
These links allow you to sync your ACT! information (including notes and his-
tory) with your handheld device in just seconds. Your ACT! information syn-
chronizes to the basic fields that are included with the Palm or Pocket PC
such as phone numbers and address information.
ACT! links allow you to
 Map basic ACT! Contact fields including phone numbers, snail mail,
e-mail addresses, several custom ACT! fields, and the ID/Status field.
 Synchronize ACT! contact notes and histories for each ACT! contact.
 Synchronize a select group of contacts when you use the Group feature
in ACT!.
376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

In addition, mini-versions of ACT! are available for Palm, Pocket PC, and
BlackBerry handheld devices. These mini-versions of ACT! allow you to view
your customized ACT! fields. You can schedule activities and create notes
exactly as you do in the full-blown version of ACT!.
Linking Your Accounting Software
Most of you business owners out there need at least two pieces of software to
run your business: database software to keep track of customers and to market
to potential customers, and accounting software to help you keep an eye on
your bottom line. Unfortunately, a piece of software that does it all often comes
with a whopping price tag and a very steep learning curve. As a result, maybe
you chose to use ACT! for your contact management and something else — like
Peachtree or QuickBooks — for your accounting. If you have larger accounting
needs, you might be using BusinessWorks or MAS 90, 200, or 500.
Accounting links can be purchased to link accounting software such as
Peachtree, QuickBooks, and MAS 90 to ACT!. These products eliminate the
need to enter your contact information into both applications. You can enter
the contact information into either ACT! or the accounting software and then
synchronize the information between the two. The link inserts a new account-
ing tab into ACT!, showing all the pertinent accounts receivable/payable infor-
mation for any linked contact in ACT!. This feature allows your sales team
access to invoice and payment history without sharing the rest of your confi-
dential accounting information.
Reporting Software
For many of you, entering data into ACT! is only half the fun; the other half is
getting that data back out again in a usable format. The typical way that most
users want to view their data is in a report.
ACT! comes with an amazing array of reports right out of the box. In Chapter
10, you can read just how easily you can tweak those basic reports. Because
variety is the spice of life, you might find yourself wandering “outside the
box” and hankering for a different report. ACT!’s Report Designer is both
powerful and very complex. Some of the more complex reports that involve
multiple levels of grouping, filtering, and sorting are beyond the scope of this
book because they require a certain level of programming skill. Consequently
you might spend a lot of time trying to develop the report of your dreams
and come up empty-handed and frustrated. 
Don’t fret. Roy Laudenslager, who just happens to be the technical editor of
this book, has come to be known as the ACT! report guru. From years on the
377
Chapter 24: Ten Tips to Make ACT! Work Better

frontline as a technical support specialist for ACT!, he has a good idea of the
types of reports that the typical user looks for. This experience led him to
develop Royel’s Reports, a collection of over 40 customized reports, labels,
and templates. You can find it at http://techbenders.com/addons.htm .
SwiftPage Email
In Chapter 12, I talk about mail merging and also mention some of the pitfalls
you might encounter when attempting an e-mail blast. A common problem is
not knowing how to create cool-looking HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
templates. Well, worry not, my friends. One of my favorite products, Swift-
Page Email, can help speed you on your way — or to at least speed your
e-mail blast to your customers.
I highly recommend using SwiftPage Email to help you with large-scale
e-blasting. Although SwiftPage is fully integrated with ACT!, your actual e-mail
is sent via the SwiftPage servers. Large companies like this concept because
their internal e-mail servers don’t have to handle a large amount of e-mail
running through them. Small office users like this concept because of the
restrictions that are sometimes placed on them by their Internet service
providers (ISPs). SwiftPage is sold on a monthly basis. Pricing is determined
by the amount of e-mail that you send and is generally a great bargain. Find
out more about the product at http://techbenders.com/act4
dummies.htm.
Northwoods Software
Some of you might feel that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Well, for
many years now, the nice folks at Northwoods Software have been providing
ACT! users with free ACT! add-ons. These add-ons consist of various free
enhancements to ACT!. At the Northwoods Web site (www.nwoods.com), you
can sign up to be placed on its list to receive notification each time a new
freebie is released.
Northwoods also produces several fee-based products:
 Sales Automation Mania (SAM): Think of this as the Activity Series on
steroids. The Activity Series reminds you that certain tasks need to be
completed on specific dates. SAM literally does your work for you by
automatically printing your mail merges, sending your birthday greet-
ings, or e-mailing your newsletters in the middle of the night.
 Mail Merge Mania: ACT! is great if your e-mail marketing consists of 
100 or fewer contacts. When you decide to send hundreds — or 
378
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

thousands — of e-mails a day, you’ll start running into all sorts of prob-
lems, including duplicate or inaccurate e-mail addresses, bounces, un-
subscribes, and even limitations on the number of e-mails that your ISP
lets you send. This product is an inexpensive way to help you overcome
those barriers.
 Web Prospect: If you receive lots of response from your Web site, you’ll
want to check out this product. Web Prospect reads the mail you receive
from your Web site registration forms and creates contacts in ACT!,
saving you hours of retyping. It also works with SAM (see the earlier
bullet) to really automate your responses to Web prospects.
Exponenciel
With all the great ACT! add-on products that are available, I can’t keep up
with them all. However, I do mention several companies by name because 
of their long-standing love for the ACT! community. Exponenciel (www.
exponenciel.com) offers some great free add-ons that you might want 
to check out, as well as a couple of really cool fee-based products.
 Advanced Field Protection is designed to give you control over which
user may enter data in your ACT! fields. Each user may be assigned a
protection scheme. Each protection scheme comprises a list of
• Fully protected fields
• Fields that are protected if not blank (therefore allowing the user
to initialize them but not to modify them after initialization)
• Tabs that are to be hidden (including system tabs)
 Excel Templates with Quote/Invoice Maker makes the generation of
quotes and invoices a snap. You’ll be able to merge sales/opportunities
data in your Excel spreadsheets.
 AutoNumbers For ACT! Records automatically gives your contacts,
companies, and/or groups a unique account number and your opportu-
nities a unique quote number. A manual mode lets you set up a number-
ing system for the current contact, current lookup, or all contacts.
The ACT! Add-On Store
The ACT! Add-On Store is run by Sharon Randall, a real ACT! fanatic. Her
knowledge of the product has helped her to put together the largest assort-
ment of ACT! add-ons that you’ll find anywhere. There are literally hundreds
of add-on products that work with ACT! 2006. These products were all
designed to fill a gap in ACT!. They range from free to hundreds of dollars,
depending on their functionality.
379
Chapter 24: Ten Tips to Make ACT! Work Better

Some of products are one-size-fits-all products, like the $49 Field Calculator
from The New Hampton Group. Others are geared for specific industries, like
the B.E.A.T. program, that’s aimed at the mortgage crowd. I like to think of it
this way: Over four million estimated ACT! users roam this Earth. Chances
are pretty good that several of them needed ACT! to do the very same thing
that you need it to do. If you’re wrestling with a unique situation that you
think ACT! just can’t conquer, you might want to check out the Add-On Store.
Playing with Gadgets
My friends always laugh about the fact that if they look in my handbag they’ll
find an assortment of Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices rather than make-
up. I confess — I’m addicted to cool gadgets. I have so many that I hardly
know where to begin, but here are three of my favorites:
 USB storage thumb drives: I mention USB storage drives as one of the
media choices for a backup in Chapter 15. I’d like to explain further why
I’ve fallen in love with these little guys. First of all, they’re tiny; hence the
nickname thumb drive. Secondly, they are powerful; storage on a 512MB
drive is roughly equivalent to that of 400 floppy disks. Third, they’re
inexpensive; you can typically expect to pay around $30 for a 512MB
drive. Finally, they’re easy to use; just stick one into your USB port, and
you’re ready to back up the entire contents of your database.
 Card Scanner: I am of the opinion that anyone with a pile of business
cards sitting on his or her desk needs to have a card scanner. These
devices are the approximate size of a radar detector and can easily sit
on a corner of your desk formerly reserved for that mountain of cards.
You simply feed the cards into the scanner, double-check the results (I
find they scan with about 95 percent accuracy), and then import them
into ACT!.
 Logitech Digital Writing System (IO2): This is my latest play toy and
quickly becoming one of my favorites. The writing system consists of a
special pen and paper; you write down notes when conferring with a
customer, and then plug your pen into a USB port when you arrive back
at your office. The pen magically transforms into a scanner, at which
point your handwritten notes can be sent to Word — or into an ACT!
note. For you disbelievers in the crowd: I have probably the worst hand-
writing known to mankind, yet this miracle device was able to decipher
my scribbling without a hitch.
