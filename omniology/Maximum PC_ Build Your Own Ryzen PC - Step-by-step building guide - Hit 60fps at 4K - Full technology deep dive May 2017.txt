XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
EMAIL 
was 
in 
my freshman year of college in 
1988. I attended Dartmouth, and 
we had a system named BlitzMail. 
Every student was granted an email 
address and access to the system. 
Like most students, I didn‚Äôt use it at 
all. It‚Äôs hard for even me to believe, 
but back then I was in the habit of 
writing letters and postcards.
I vividly recall the tipping point, 
though. In 1re years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start using it. Like a lot of corporate 
workplaces, email was commonly 
used for interoffice communications. 
But the volume wa989 in the middle 
of my sophomore year, I was eating 
lunch with a few freshmen who were 
talking about how great email was 
for chatting up women. I remember 
being shocked at the notion that 
these guys didn‚Äôt have the courage to 
pick up the phone. Little did I know. 
I‚Äôd be lying if I said that I took to 
email the next day. I didn‚Äôt. It took 
three more years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start using it. Like a lot of corporate 
workplaces, email was commonly 
used for interoffice communications. 
But the volume was manageable; I 
remember going two or three hours 
without new email. That sounds 
absolutely crazy now, but this was 
the era before SPAM even existed. 
As more friends started working 
and came online, the postcard- and 
letter-writing days ended forever. 
(That lab job was also awesome 
because after four years of using 
a Mac in college, I was able to get 
back to PC gaming‚Äîafter hours, of 
course.)
I‚Äôll be honest; I still love checking 
my inbox and discovering email‚Äî
from 
friends, 
family, 
writers, 
readers, PR people, whomever‚Äîeven 
if it has become a bit overwhelming. 
Between re years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start usingaccounts, I‚Äôve never had 
trouble keeping up. Until now. This is 
partially what inspired this month‚Äôs 
cover story. Over the last 18 months, 
I‚Äôve begun to notice that my ability to 
quickly parse, read, and respond to 
email just isn‚Äôt fast enough anymore. 
I need to develop new systems and 
shortcuts. I need to change my ways. 
I‚Äôm 
curious‚Äîare

finding 
yourself in the same boat as I am?

BACK WHEN I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL, the 
PC landscape was largely dominated 
by Intel. There were more than just two 
players at that point. For example, does 
anyone remember Cyrix? AMD, too, 
was a secondary option. Every available 
alternative was essentially a licensed or 
reverse engineered version of an Intel 
CPU. And while some non-Intel CPUs 
offered unique features, most if not all of 
them were plagued by underperforming 
chipsets and lackluster motherboards. 
Sure, options were plentiful, but they 
were all third-rate choices, and the 
market was hungry for more.
AMD‚Äîseemingly out of nowhere‚Äî
delivered the equivalent of an atomic 
explosion to the market when it released 
the Athlon CPU. With the K6 series 
processor behind it, offering unexciting 
performance, the new Athlon CPU was 
a great improvement. AMD further 
improved on it, and the Athlon 64 was 
such 
a 
monumental 
performance 
brute that it was essentially elevated to 
revered status.
But that was the last great CPU from 
AMD. Intel‚Äôs response was to completely 
overhaul its approach to CPU design, 
putting huge resources into reclaiming 
its throne. AMD‚Äôs later K10 and Bulldozer 
family CPUs fell behind in both the 
desktop and server playgrounds, and 
AMD was again a distant second place.
Athlon 
had 
been 
so 
good 
that 
consumer expectations hit levels that 
AMD was never able to reach. The loyal 
following that believed in AMD was 
left feeling betrayed. And betrayed is, 
I think, an apt way to describe the last 
decade. It‚Äôs no surprise that when AMD 
announced its new Zen architecture, the 
world widened its eyes, but remained 
cautious. There was talk that Zen could 
be the CPU that makes or breaks AMD. 
The company knows that it can‚Äôt falter 
again‚Äîand it hasn‚Äôt.
Zen, now called Ryzen, is the most 
exciting thing for consumers from 
AMD since the original Athlon. Ryzen 
represents much more than just a 
CPU for AMD. For the 47-year-old chip 
company, Ryzen represents a return to 
the ring. For consumers like you and me, 
Ryzen revitalizes the CPU race.
AMD has a lot to prove, and Zen will 
be its combatant on all levels. It might 
not win every round, but at least it has a 
puncher‚Äôs chance.
Does Ryzen renew my faith in AMD‚Äôs 
CPUs? Ryzen does more than that‚Äîit 
proves to me that AMD has found its 
stride. It tells me that the company 
invested heavily in its R&D, and is willing 
to jump in for many more bouts. Our tests 
show that Ryzen is a serious competitor 
against anything that Intel has to offer. 
From entry level to high end, AMD shows 
it can Ô¨Çex some serious muscle.
For me, it‚Äôs time to let go of those 
Athlon days. AMD isn‚Äôt just back‚ÄîRyzen 
shows that there‚Äôs a new AMD in town.

Ryzen‚Äôs core and thread 
count, eÔ¨Äiciency, and price 
continue to impress.
Ryzen 5 arrives, with 3 following 
soon after‚Äîplus a small bug
Ryzen Family  
Grows Bigger
thread power lags slightly, 
it tops out at 4GHz on boost, 
behind the 4.2GHz possible with 
the 7600. Anything that loves 
lots of threads really thrives. 
Later this year, we‚Äôll see the 
Ryzen 3: four-core but without 
SMT. The 3.4GHz 1200X comes 
in at $149; drop to 3.2GHz and 
there‚Äôs the $129 1100. These go 
against Intel i3s, with dual cores 
and HT, which should make for 
interesting comparisons. 
ONE SMALL FLY
So far, the Ryzen has proved 
capable, but not completely 
fault-free. A bug has emerged 
that can potentially lock the 
system completely. The problem 
occurs when the chip runs 
single-precision 128-bit FMA3 
operations, Fused Multiply Add. 
It‚Äôs not an instruction that gets 
much use, and the bug only 
surfaced during benchmarking 
designed to stretch the Ô¨Çoating-
point performance from every 
angle. A BIOS update cures the 
problem. If you have a Ryzen, 
there‚Äôs little cause to worry‚Äîto 
date, no mainstream application 
has proved vulnerable.
Ryzen‚Äôs performance under 
some conditions proved less 
than expected, or hoped for 
by some testers, and rumors 
started that it was down to SMT 
problems (Simultaneous Multi-
Threading). More speciÔ¨Åcally, it 
has been claimed that Windows 
10 
wasn‚Äôt 
spreading 
the 
workload properly across the 
cores, not identifying primary 
and virtual threads properly. 
However, it transpires there‚Äôs 
nothing in this one; AMD has 
investigated, and went as far as 
issuing an ofÔ¨Åcial denial, along 
with helpful tips on building 
Ryzen rigs, including quite a bit 
on matching memory carefully.
Expecting a fault-free design 
for something as complex as 
a new processor architecture 
is asking a lot. Intel‚Äôs Skylake 
suffered 
a 
similar 
FMA3 
problem last year. These bugs 
are nothing, though. The original 
Pentium had a fundamental bug 
in the FPU that could return the 
wrong answer. That led to Intel 
recalling chips, writing off $475 
million, and making some very 
expensive key rings.
Ryzen is going to put Intel 
under pressure across the price 
range. They even use the same 
basic numbering system, just 
so it‚Äôs all perfectly clear. Much 
mileage can, and certainly will, 
be made of differences under 
speciÔ¨Åc tests, games, and 
conditions. Intel, as ever, looks 
to have a slight edge on single-
thread grunt, where clock 
speed is all. To some, an extra 
frame rate on their favorite 
game is all that matters, but 
Ryzen‚Äôs core and thread count, 
efÔ¨Åciency, and price continue 
to impress. The Ô¨Åght is moving 
to mainstream and budget rigs 
now, and we suspect it‚Äôll be 
even keener here. ‚ÄìCL
WE‚ÄôVE HAD A WHILE to evaluate 
AMD‚Äôs Ryzen 7, and some have 
been a little harsh; expecting 
it to beat the best gaming 
processor ever at its Ô¨Årst 
attempt is asking a lot. Game 
optimization for Ryzen has 
barely started, either. It‚Äôs about 
performance for the price, and 
here it hasn‚Äôt disappointed. 
AMD has now expanded the 
range with the Ryzen 5.
Initially, 
we 
have 
four 
versions. The 3.2GHz 1600 and 
3.6GHz 1600X have six cores 
and 16MB cache, while the 
3.5GHz 1500X and the 3.2GHz 
1400 make do with four cores 
and 8MB of cache. Initial prices 
run from just $169 for the 1400 
to $249 for a 1600X. We also get 
snazzy new coolers: the Wraith 
Spire and Stealth. The Ryzen 7 
signiÔ¨Åcantly undercut Intel‚Äôs i7, 
while Ryzen 5 is a more direct 
price comparison with rival i5s.
The 1600X looks to be a sweet 
spot here. It‚Äôs up against the 
$242 Core i5-7600K, but packs 
two more cores and three times 
the threads. Although single-

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
ON THE 28TH ANNIVERSARY of the paper that started it 
all, Tim Berners-Lee issued a warning against what he 
sees as the biggest problems facing the web through the 
World Wide Web Foundation.
He highlighted three problems: that we have lost control of our personal data, 
the rapid distribution of misinformation, and the lack of transparency in political 
advertising. Smart algorithms mean we are often served carefully targeted 
information. Articles designed to shock, interest, or appeal to our bias are 
quickly spread, along with disguised political advertising. 
What can be done is a tough one. The gathering of our online data has been a 
fundamental part of the commercial Internet for years. People still share huge 
amounts of personal data with little thought of consequences. The increasing 
use of this data for political ends is most worrying. The Internet is still viewed in 
the West as empowering; increasingly, it‚Äôs also manipulative, and worse. ‚ÄìCL

WINDOWS UPDATES 
BLOCKED BY CHIPS
IF YOU‚ÄôVE BUILT a lovely new Ryzen or Kaby Lake system, and stuck with Windows 7 or 8, 
there‚Äôs a catch. According to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article, Windows Update now 
informs you that you have unsupported hardware when you try to update. The solution, 
naturally, is an upgrade to Windows 10. The cited reason is Microsoft‚Äôs ‚Äúsupport policy.‚Äù 
We knew this was coming‚Äîlast year, Microsoft said that Windows 10 would be the only 
platform to support Kaby Lake, Qualcomm 8996, and AMD Bristol Ridge. 
Not many people will be running the latest chips alongside older versions of Windows, so 
adding support would be unproÔ¨Åtable. But cutting off all updates does look mean-spirited. 
Older versions of Windows run perfectly well on new silicon; there‚Äôs no technical problem. 
This move leaves you out in the cold; you won‚Äôt even get basic security updates. Boo. ‚ÄìCL
LATEST HARDWARE NOW KILLS 
WINDOWS 7 AND 8 UPDATES
HOPES FOR NINTENDO‚ÄôS little games console 
weren‚Äôt high in all quarters during its 
protracted development. It missed key 
deadlines and was subject to much rumor 
and speculation, and did we really need 
a hybrid console and handheld anyway? 
However, 
sales 
have 
been 
decidedly 
brisk‚Äî1.5 million were shifted during the 
Ô¨Årst week. Nintendo had planned to ship 
eight million in the Ô¨Årst year, but has revised 
this to 16 million. That puts it in line to outsell 
the Wii U in under a year. 
Nintendo is not the force it once was 
in consoles, and has been left struggling 
against the Xbox and PlayStation in recent 
years. The Wii U didn‚Äôt shift in the numbers 
it needed, and developers‚Äô attention started 
to wander. The initial game releases for 
the Switch were criticized as being rather 
simplistic and tired, apart from the lovely 
Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
However, momentum is gathering, and it 
has attracted some decent titles, including 
Mario Kart 8, Elder Scrolls V, and Splatoon 
2. Better yet, there are strong indications of 
a Pokemon game in the pipeline.
There have been a few problems, 
including Joy-Con controllers failing to 
connect. Its success also signals the end 
for the Wii U, as developers switch (sorry) to 
the new hardware. The new Zelda will be the 
last game the Wii U gets. The 
company had a lot riding 
on this, and there must 
be some very relieved 
people back at HQ‚Äîit 
certainly did the share

that we did want a

TECH TALK
AMD Naples Shows 
OÔ¨Ä Scalability
To make everything work properly, AMD reworked 
many of the building blocks for Zen, including the 
InÔ¨Ånity Fabric. Zen features a four-core/eight-thread 
module as its primary building block, combining 
512KB of L2 cache per core with a shared 8MB L3 
cache, and Ryzen uses two of these modules for the 
eight-core/16-thread parts. Naples then takes four 
of those, and puts them in a single package, yielding 
a 32-core/64-thread part. And in the process, all of 
the major interfaces are doubled.
That gives Naples a massive eight-channel DDR4 
memory controller, supporting up to 16 DIMMs, with 
128 PCIe Gen3 lanes of external connectivity. The 
whole package also comes with an integrated SoC 
(System on a Chip), so there‚Äôs no need for external 
chipsets. One Naples CPU is all that‚Äôs required to 
support memory, IO, graphics, and more.
AMD showed off a dual-socket 2U server, running 
64-cores/128-threads. The sockets use the InÔ¨Ånity 
Fabric to talk to each other‚Äîin this case, 64 PCIe 
lanes are used for the 63GB/s interlink between 
sockets. That leaves 128 total PCIe lanes for external 
devices, and doubles the memory channels to 16. 
And AMD rates Naples at up to DDR4-2400 memory 
speeds with all DIMM sockets populated.
Many server workloads become heavily bound by 
memory bandwidth and performance, and AMD‚Äôs 
AMD HAS MADE PLENTY OF WAVES with its Zen architecture, which has 
some really interesting concepts, along with a price that has attracted 
a lot of attention. One of the key design elements of Zen is that it‚Äôs 
supposed to be highly scalable, from ultra-low-power parts for laptops, 
to desktops and servers, and the real star of AMD‚Äôs Zen architecture 
might just prove to be the server processors, code-named Naples. 
Naples delivers more than twice 
the memory bandwidth of Intel‚Äôs top 
dual-socket server. For high-end 
workloads like HPC, transactional 
databases, and virtualization, this 
could give AMD a major advantage.
To drive home this point, AMD 
put together a head-to-head battle 
between its Naples server and 
another server equipped with two 
of Intel‚Äôs fastest Xeon part, the 
E5-2699A v4. Running a seismic 
analysis workload that involves 
computationally intensive 3D wave 
equations, which taxes the entire 
system, Naples destroyed Intel‚Äôs 
Xeon server. With identical core 
counts and memory speed, Naples 
was twice as fast, and with a fully 
armed battlestation sporting 64 
cores and DDR4-2400 memory, 
Naples was 2.5 times faster.
How realistic is this comparison? 
That‚Äôs difÔ¨Åcult to say, but in the high

performance computing scenarios 
where 
AMD 
wants 
Naples 
to 
compete, running software that‚Äôs

architecture is common practice. 
So, Naples out of the gate should

very 
impressive, 
and 
with 
plenty of extra cores and memory 
bandwidth, you‚Äôd expect AMD to

on our desktops, but servers can 
easily make use of such capabilities.
Naples is slated to launch in Q2 
of 2017, though AMD hasn‚Äôt revealed 
pricing or the various models yet. 
It will be partnering with other 
companies to bring the servers to 
market, and Naples should garner 
a lot of interest. Intel will also have 
new Xeon parts later this year, based 
on Skylake/Kaby Lake, which may 
close the gap. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to 
see a rapid overhaul of the existing 
IT infrastructure, as companies 
tend to be a lot more cautious, but 
it will be good to have a competitive 
AMD server solution again.
Naples delivers more than 
twice the memory bandwidth 
of Intel‚Äôs top dual-socket server
The massive CPU package houses

At the beginning of March, NASA made a large 
library of software programs available to the 
‚Äúpublic.‚Äù The software runs the gamut from code 
to control propulsion systems to environmental 
science to boring old project management tools. 
But what‚Äôs with the quotes around ‚Äúpublic‚Äù? 
Of the 975 software projects that have been 
released to the public, only 210 (about 22 percent) 
are released as open source. Many others are 
available as a government release, of which many 
are only available to other government agencies or 
government contractors. Getting access to one-Ô¨Åfth 
of what NASA released is better than nothing, but 
I‚Äôm a little thrown off by the decision to advertise 
the offering of software that only other government 
ofÔ¨Åcials or contractors can actually look at. 
First off, I‚Äôm a Ô¨Årm believer in the concept behind 
Code For America, an organization that looks to 
enlist young programers to create open-source 
applications in the public interest. Offering up 
code in an open-source format or Git repository for 
people to contribute to could be a huge resource for 
an agency that‚Äôs been cash-strapped for decades.
Second, I‚Äôm forced to wonder why NASA would 
put links for code on a public website when some 
of that code isn‚Äôt accessible to the public. It‚Äôs like 
telling a kid in a toy store, ‚ÄúYou can play with any 
toy you want, except those. Those are special 
toys.‚Äù It‚Äôs also curious that some of the tools are 
hosted 
at 
SourceForge. 
Some 
of the projects have Subversion 
(SVN) repositories available, but 
most open-source projects use Git 
nowadays. It would be great to see 
these projects hosted on a GitLab 
server somewhere. (GitLab is akin 
to a self-hosted GitHub.) Having 
a single central server to host Git 
repos would be much more efÔ¨Åcient 
than the slapdash collection of links 
that are available now.
Nevertheless, I‚Äôm excited to 
see tools that are literally used by 
rocket scientists made available for 
everyone. One example is NASA‚Äôs 
General Mission Analysis Tool, or 
GMAT.  According to the ReadMe, 
‚ÄúGMAT 
is 
a 
space 
trajectory 
optimization and mission analysis 
system developed by NASA and 
private industry in the spirit of the 
NASA Vision.‚Äù Basically, you can use 
GMAT to plan orbits of stuff shot into 
space. Neato. And NASA released it 
under the Apache license, to boot. 
In addition to the source, you can 
get the application for Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. 
Some other projects, such as 
the 
Global 
Precipitation 
Space 
and Ground Radar Comparison 
Software, 
are 
released 
under 
NASA‚Äôs Open Source Agreement 
(NOSA). Version 1.3 of the NOSA has 
been certiÔ¨Åed by the Open Source 
Initiative  as a valid open-source 
license, but the Free Software 
Alex Campbell is a Linux geek 
who enjoys learning about 
computer security.
It‚Äôs fun to poke around and 
take a peek at what‚Äôs been 
under NASA‚Äôs hood for the past 
few years.

deeper glimpse into what it takes to go to space.

If you want to check out any of 
these projects, just head over to

of the software isn‚Äôt terribly useful

BY JEREMY LAIRD
Storage was once the Ô¨Ånal frontier of PC performance, and the last component to become 
fully solid state. Today, the latest M.2 SSDs powered by the new NVMe protocol and hooked 
up via zappy PCIe connections deliver performance that a conventional hard drive wouldn‚Äôt 
recognize. Yet the hard drive isn‚Äôt dead. Not when it offers so much capacity for so little 
money. Meanwhile, the trusty SATA SSD offers a combination of compatibility and speed 
that‚Äôs awfully compelling. Time to Ô¨Ånd out which storage technology is the best.
Magnetic Hard Drive vs.
SATA SSD vs. M.2 NVMe
Capacity
Spare a thought for the poor old 
conventional hard drive. In this brave 
new age of solid-state computing, the 
very notion of moving parts seems 
utterly antediluvian. But this is its chance 
to shine. When it comes to raw storage 
capacity, 
those 
spinning 
magnetic 
platters positively annihilate the solid-
state alternatives.
Perhaps most impressive is the 
fact that, while CPU performance has 
somewhat stagnated, and the power of 
Moore‚Äôs Law to predict chip shrinkage 
may well have stalled, the ability of 
magnetic hard drive makers to pack in 
ever more capacity hasn‚Äôt waned at all. 
Innovations such as the use of helium to 
reduce internal air shear saw the 10TB 
barrier cracked last year in the consumer 
drive space, and that progress looks set 
to continue, albeit at quite a price. 
Aim a little lower, and the likes of a 
3TB drive are now available for as little 
as $75‚Äîand even less if you are willing to 
roll the dice on a refurb. The only caveat 
is that if you don‚Äôt have a big video or 
games library, you probably don‚Äôt need a 
big hard disk at all, and a much nippier 
budget SSD of around 500GB is probably 
all most mainstream users will ever  
actually need.
Winner:
Magnetic hard drive
Performance
You might think the choice between old-
school magnetic drives, conventional 
SATA SSDs, and the latest M.2 items 
was a total no-brainer. For the most 
part, you‚Äôd be right. Magnetic drives, 
with their quaintly spinning platters 
and delicately servo‚Äôed read heads, 
certainly don‚Äôt stand a chance when it 
comes to raw performance. They‚Äôre OK 
at sequential workloads, albeit offering 
about one tenth the speed of a decent 
SSD at best, but they really suck when it 
comes to random access.
SATA SSDs, meanwhile, may be 
pretty quick, even by modern standards, 
but they‚Äôre ultimately held back by both 
the SATA interface itself, which caps 
peak performance at about 550MB/s, 
and the elderly AHCI control protocol, 
which was never intended to be used 
with solid-state tech.
So it‚Äôs M.2 and its zippy PCI Express 
interconnect that easily rules the day, 
with the latest drives topping 3GB/s 
for peak performance, and packing the 
highly optimized NVMe control protocol. 
The catch is system compatibility, and 
that‚Äôs why M.2 isn‚Äôt a complete no-
brainer. Especially for older PCs, a SATA 
SSD may be the most painless path to 
decent storage performance.
Winner:
M.2 NVMe 
Compatibility 
Given the radical change in technology 
represented by solid-state storage, it‚Äôs 
surprising that it wasn‚Äôt accompanied 
by 
major 
compatibility 
problems. 
However, thanks to adopting existing 
standards, including the SATA interface 
and support for legacy IDE and AHCI 
control protocols, SSD compatibility has 
been, for the most part, a breeze. SATA 
ports have been standard on nearly all 
motherboards for a very long time.
So, whether your SATA drive is 
solid state or magnetic isn‚Äôt hugely 
consequential in compatibility terms. 
But things get more complicated when 
it comes to those newfangled M.2 drives. 
Any motherboard more than two years 
old almost certainly lacks an M.2 port. 
What‚Äôs more, having an M.2 port doesn‚Äôt 
automatically mean support for the 
highly desirable NVMe control protocol.
Granted, it is possible to buy M.2 PCI 
Express adapter boards to add support 
to legacy motherboards. But the older 
your mobo, the more likely it is to have 
issues supporting booting from the drive 
and, again, that NVMe protocol. It‚Äôs also 
worth remembering that your M.2 drive 
will only be as fast as the PCIe lanes 
provided by the motherboard.

Durability
This is the most contentious metric. 
Firstly, that‚Äôs because durability can 
mean different things. For a portable PC, 
a solid-state drive is a huge bonus, and 
has the potential to be far more robust 
than a fragile magnetic drive, with 
spinning platter and moving read heads.
For a desktop PC, where physical 
shocks 
and 
exposure 
to 
extreme 
temperatures 
are 
less 
common, 
durability is all about the ability to soak 
up a lot of bandwidth, without losing 
performance and capacity, or failing.
The early days of SSDs were grim in 
that regard. Outright failure wasn‚Äôt that 
common, but a drop-off in performance 
was inevitable over time. Six months of 
heavy use could truly hammer those Ô¨Årst 
SSDs. Since then, multiple technologies, 
including advance wear leveling and 
garbage 
collection 
routines, 
have 
dramatically improved the situation. Of 
course, the performance of hard drives 
can go off over time, too, with data 
fragmentation. But that‚Äôs usually Ô¨Åxable 
with a little defragging. Overall, however, 
the very best M.2 SSDs can be had with 
warranties and life expectancies of 
around Ô¨Åve years, even with very heavy 
workloads. On balance, they‚Äôre probably 
now the most robust storage technology.
Winner:
M.2 NVMe
Value 
What price do you put on capacity or 
performance? That‚Äôs the conundrum 
you face when sizing up the value of the 
various storage options. You cannot 
maximize both attributes. Solid state 
prices have come down, but when it 
comes to GB/$, they‚Äôre still obliterated 
by traditional magnetic storage.
A $75 3TB hard disk, for instance, 
works out at around 40GB per dollar. 
Matching that capacity with an SSD 
will cost you roughly 10 times as much. 
Meanwhile, even the sweet spot of 
current SSD GB/$, which is probably 
the 1TB segment, only delivers roughly 
3GB per dollar. And that‚Äôs for a budget-
oriented SATA SSD. The fanciest M.2 
drives look like even worse value.
Of 
course, 
shift 
your 
priorities 
toward performance, and the tables 
are resolutely turned. When it comes 
to random access performance, which 
is 
especially 
critical 
for 
everyday 
performance 
and 
responsiveness, 
SSDs can be over 100 times faster than 
magnetic drives. That said, the cheaper 
end of the SATA SSD spectrum probably 
gives you the best bang for buck. But take 
care to avoid the very lowliest, which 
often use cheap controllers intended for 
USB drives, to save money. 
Winner:
SATA SSD
And the
Winner Is‚Ä¶
Call us indecisive, but the Ô¨Ånal verdict 
on which storage medium is best 
really has to come down to your own 
personal usage model. If you want to 
maximize sheer capacity, for instance, 
a conventional hard drive is an absolute 
no-brainer. It‚Äôs literally an order of 
magnitude cheaper. Even if money is of 
no consequence, one can only connect 
so many drives, and hard disks are 
simply bigger. 
On the other hand, if performance is 
your exclusive priority, then one of the 
latest M.2 SSDs with support for the 
NVMe protocol should be your weapon 
of choice. These solid-state devices 
now deliver performance measured in 
gigabytes per second, which you have 
to admit, is pretty stunning. 
However, 
perhaps 
the 
best 
overall compromise of performance, 
compatibility, and value for now is an 
SSD hooked up via the good old SATA 
interface. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to give 
and aging PC new life. 
So, before you splash out on a new 
storage device, think about whether 
your priority is speed, cost, or a balance 
of the two, then take your pick.

OS Alternatives
Aloha, Doctor. Currently, my 
PC is running Windows 7 
Ultimate, not because I am 
cheap, but because I refuse to 
throw money away. Every time 
I have chosen to buy the latest 
Microsoft operating system, 
I end up paying thousands of 
dollars for other applications 
I already own because they no 
longer work properly.
Working as a photographer 
who needs his monitors to stay 
clean, I passed on Windows 8 
because of its Metro user 
interface (even though the 
move to a UEFI would have Ô¨Åxed 
multiple issues with my 24-plus 
hard drives). Windows 10 looks 
a lot better, but I just can‚Äôt bring 
myself to buy all of my software 
over again.
So, besides Apple and Linux, 
are there any other alternatives 
available to address what I 
consider to be corporate greed?
‚ÄìGordon
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: How 
much convenience are you 
willing to give up for your 
principles? The Windows 
ecosystem isn‚Äôt perfect, but it 
provides the greatest breadth 
of choice when it comes to 
picking tools for work and play. 
If you‚Äôve run into compatibility 
issues upgrading from one 
version of Windows to another, 
it might be worth considering 
better-supported software, 
rather than razing your hard 
drive and starting over.
The Doc sympathizes with 
those who eschew Windows 
and MacOS for a foundation 
built on free and open-source 
software. But why disregard 
Linux as well? Linux Mint, 
Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and 
OpenSUSE are all popular 
distributions made stronger by 
rich libraries of open-source 
tools and apps. FreeBSD 
or Haiku would probably 
be next on the Doc‚Äôs list if 
you are serious about going 
the alternative operating 
system route.
Whichever direction you 
go, start by installing VMware 
Workstation Player on your 
Windows 7-based PC. That will 
give you an opportunity to try 
the various options without 
doing irreparable damage to 
your existing setup.
Easier Than You Think
Dear Doc, I‚Äôm planning on 
building a PC in an NZXT S340 
Elite chassis using an EVGA 
SuperNOVA 850W power supply, 
a Gigabyte Z270-based Gaming 
7 motherboard, Intel‚Äôs Core 
i7-7700K, a GeForce GTX 1080, 
32GB of G.Skill DDR4 memory, 
Samsung‚Äôs 500GB 960 EVO in 
an M.2 form factor, a WD 2TB 
hard drive, and NZXT‚Äôs Kraken 
X52 cooler. While there‚Äôs no 
time pressure, I don‚Äôt want to 
screw this up and destroy any 
of the components I‚Äôm buying. 
Cost is important, but not the 
primary consideration.
I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs a good idea 
to assemble all the components 
outside the case to verify they 
work properly before installing 
them. Assuming that this is 
a reasonable approach, my 
plan would be to install the 
RAM, graphics card, CPU, and 
M.2 SSD on the motherboard. 
However, the Z270-based board 
has two M.2 connectors, so 
which should I use, given that 
I‚Äôm installing a GeForce GTX 
1080? From there, I‚Äôm guessing 
I‚Äôd connect my monitor to the 
graphics card, hook up to the 
PSU, and power up.
The next step, I imagine, 
would be to install Windows 10 
from a thumb drive. Can I install 
Windows without attaching 
the closed-loop cooler, or 
does this put the CPU at risk? 
Ideally, I‚Äôd set the cooler up 
after transferring my hardware 
to its Ô¨Ånal resting place in the 
case, at which point I could also 
plug in the fans and install the 
hard drive.
I‚Äôm perhaps most nervous 
about installing Windows 10. 
As long as I‚Äôve built PCs, most 
of my problems have come 
from one Microsoft product 
or another. Any comments or 
advice you could pass my way 
would be much appreciated.
‚ÄìPeter Luptovic
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Assembling and powering 
up components outside of 
your case is a good way to 
troubleshoot known issues. If 
all of this machine‚Äôs hardware 
is new, though, build it up into 
the chassis straight away to 
avoid accidental bumps, falls, 
or spills. Some enthusiasts 
insist on installing their CPU 
and memory on an open test 
bench, but NZXT‚Äôs S340 is 
roomy enough to work inside.
That should address your 
question about installing 
Windows without a heatsink 
and fan on your CPU, too. Intel‚Äôs 
Core i7-7700K does include 
sensors and protections to 
The still-majestic Cosmos 
1000 lacks USB 3.0 ports.

prevent the type of damage 
insufÔ¨Åcient cooling would 
cause. Those aren‚Äôt features 
you want to test, though. 
Make sure your Kraken X52 
is attached properly before 
applying power to the 7700K.
When it‚Äôs time to install the 
Samsung 960 EVO, you‚Äôll have 
to pick between the Z270X-
Gaming 7‚Äôs M.2 slots. One 
shares bandwidth with SATA 
ports 4 and 5, while the other 
shares bandwidth with the 
four-lane PCIe slot. So long as 
you hook the 2TB WD hard drive 
up to SATA port 0, 1, 2, or 3, drop 
the SSD into M2M_32G.
Finally, don‚Äôt worry too 
much about Windows 10. On 
a modern platform such as 
yours, the installation should 
be reasonably painless.
Modernizing a Classic
Hello, Doctor! I have a Cooler 
Master Cosmos 1000 case that 
I absolutely love, and in the 
near future I plan to swap out 
my old hardware and install 
modern components. This 
would include updating to native 
support for USB 3.0. Is there a 
replacement front I/O panel that 
would add this functionality to 
the Cosmos chassis? I haven‚Äôt 
really gotten anywhere with my 
searches online. ‚ÄìMatt Cathey
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: A lot of 
Cosmos 1000 owners would like 
to see Cooler Master support 
the old (but still beautiful) case 
with a replacement I/O panel 
sporting USB 3.0 connectivity. 
Unfortunately, no such upgrade 
seems to exist.
Short of selling the chassis 
and buying a Cosmos II, it 
may be best to install a USB 
3.0-equipped 3.5-inch bracket 
into one of your vacant drive 
bays. Cooler Master used to 
make these (RA-USB-3035-IN), 
and you can still get them 
shipped in from overseas.
Storage Upgrade Woes
Hello Doc, I‚Äôve been trying 
to add SSDs to a system I 
assembled back in 2010, which 
is based on an Asus Rampage 
II Gene motherboard running 
Windows 7. After updating the 
BIOS to v.1701 back in 2012 
and installing a Core i7-980 
CPU, I left its internals alone. 
I originally considered retiring 
the PC. But it works Ô¨Åne, and 
I think I can get a few more 
years out of it by replacing the 
mechanical hard drives with a 
pair of Samsung 850 Pro SSDs.
Since I‚Äôm writing in, you can 
imagine my simple upgrade 
hasn‚Äôt gone well. After 
mirroring my C:\ drive to one 
SSD, I tried to reboot and failed. 
Resetting the BIOS Storage 
ConÔ¨Åguration option to AHCI, 
and changing JMicron 36x ATA 
Controller to IDE/AHCI did 
nothing to help. As I re-imaged 
and swapped drives, I noticed 
a few behaviors that I thought 
might indicate the nature of 
this failure.
Question 1: After the new 
drive was swapped in, I had to 
go through Windows‚Äô repair 
process, which eventually 
aborted. But once the BIOS was 
set back to IDE mode, I could 
get the original drive to work 
again. And if I removed the 
second hard drive, the system 
wouldn‚Äôt reboot even with the 
original disk in place. Naturally, 
I marked the SATA cables to 
make sure my connections 
didn‚Äôt change. Changing 
back to AHCI, the machine 
wouldn‚Äôt boot with the original 
drive in place. I‚Äôm not sure 
why switching to AHCI would 
prevent me from booting, all 
else remaining constant.
Question 2: During attempts 
to boot from the SSD, a blue 
screen Ô¨Çashed on and off. I 
would love to know what the 
message said, but I needed 
more than 12 milliseconds 
to read it, and I can‚Äôt seem to 
pause the loop.
Question 3: When the SSD 
was in place, it showed up in 
the BIOS correctly. Moreover, 
Windows‚Äô repair routine had to 
be running from it. The other 
HDD is only used for data; it 
doesn‚Äôt have any OS Ô¨Åles. How 
could the SSD run in limited 
mode and fail to boot?
Asus mentions a BIOS/
Secure Boot issue that might 
complicate installation of a 
new boot drive. This might also 
explain why I‚Äôm having a hard 
time booting from the original 
hard drive after the SSD fails 
the repair process. But I can‚Äôt 
Ô¨Ånd the feature Asus is talking 
about, so I may not have it in this 
older BIOS.
Any suggestions would be 
welcome! I‚Äôd love to keep this 
machine going with a faster 
storage subsystem.
‚ÄìJon Anderson
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Worst-
case scenario, you reinstall 
Windows on one of the new 
SSDs and enjoy a reinvigorated 
Gulftown-based machine. 
There‚Äôs no reason to let a drive 
swap slow you down. But Ô¨Årst 
let‚Äôs try bringing your existing 
operating environment back 
from the dead.
When you changed the BIOS 
from IDE to AHCI mode, there‚Äôs 
a good chance Windows was 
still trying to load your IDE 
controller‚Äôs drivers, causing 
the crash. If you‚Äôre still able to 
get the original disk to boot with 
the Storage ConÔ¨Åguration set 
to IDE, try this (copied straight 
from Microsoft):
‚Ä¢ Click ‚ÄúStart,‚Äù type ‚Äúregedit‚Äù in 
the ‚ÄúStart Search‚Äù box, and then 
press Enter.
‚Ä¢ If you receive the ‚ÄúUser 
Account Control‚Äù dialog box, 
click ‚ÄúContinue.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Locate and then click the 
following registry subkeys: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
System\CurrentControlSet\
Services\Msahci
‚Ä¢ In the pane on the right, right-
click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù in the ‚ÄúName‚Äù 
column, then click ‚ÄúModify.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ In the ‚ÄúValue‚Äù data box, type 
‚Äú0‚Äù and then click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ On the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu, click 
‚ÄúExit‚Äù to close Registry Editor.
Upon restarting, Windows 
should load the AHCI driver 
and boot. If that works, try 
re-imaging to the SSD. Leave 
the BIOS set to AHCI mode and 
see if you have better luck.
Kill a BIOS Password
Hi Doctor, I have a desktop with 
Windows 7 Pro on it. I tried to 
access the BIOS in order to 
perform a fresh installation, 
but the Ô¨Årmware is password-
protected and I don‚Äôt have 
the original owner‚Äôs contact 
information. Is there a software 
or hardware trick to remove or 
reset the BIOS password?
‚ÄìMichael Ward
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Most 
motherboards rely on 3V CMOS 
batteries for saving BIOS 
settings. Make sure your PC is 
turned off, disconnect power to 
the board, and locate the button 
cell. Remove it by pressing on 
the retaining clip. Wait a minute 
or so before popping it back and 
restoring power. You should 
get a message that the BIOS 
settings were restored to their 
defaults. The Doc tested this on 
multiple boards in the lab with a 
100 percent success rate. 
Remove the CR2032 battery to 
clear BIOS passwords.
You should give Linux a try if you‚Äôre tired of Windows.

WE‚ÄôVE GONE A LITTLE AMD MAD this issue, as you can 
probably tell. The plucky underdog has really rattled 
the cages of the establishment. And, yes, although there 
are bugs‚Äîslowly being ironed out by developers and 
OS engineers alike‚Äîthe value proposition put forward 
by AMD‚Äôs new line-up of 7-series chips opens a whole 
plethora of new opportunities for those looking to 
supercharge their HEDT experience. 
But Ô¨Årst, let‚Äôs get one thing straight: This is, by no 
means, a cheap build. Coming in at almost $5,300, 
this system holds nothing back when it comes to part 
selection, particularly on the storage front. Slapping 
64GB of high-spec DDR4, 22TB of storage, and an 
external NAS together bumps the price up by a staggering 
$3,127, accounting for an incredible 59 percent of the 
total expense. Selecting 32GB of 2,400MT/s DDR4, a 
250GB PCIe SSD, and two 2TB HDDs instead would drop 
the price by $2,484, bringing it to a far more reasonable 
$2,804 for a high-end rendering station.
That said, as far as computational performance 
goes, and value per dollar, the core spec of this build 
is impressive, to say the least, smashing almost all of 
our system benchmarks, and hammering our zero-
point system into the ground. With Ryzen‚Äôs eight-core 
processors now cheaper than some of Intel‚Äôs four-core 
Kaby Lake offerings, this could mark the beginning of the 
end for mainstream quad-core systems‚Ä¶
Budget? No, it‚Äôs certainly not that‚Äîthis is our 
AMD-powered, plug-and-play, rendering titan

It‚Äôs weird having choice again, 
even in this climate of Ryzen 7 
CPUs being available. For the best 
bang for your buck, you have three 
options: the 1700, the 1700X, and 
the 1800X. In theory, the best chips 
for overclocking should be the 
1700X and the 1800X‚Äîhowever, 
we‚Äôve heard rumors suggesting 
that some 1700 chips are actually 
capable of out-clocking even the 
top-end 95W parts. That said, for 
stock clocks and reliability‚Äôs sake, 
the 1800X is king of the hill, and 
although it may not be the best-
value processor out there, it‚Äôs still 
$500 less than its Intel equivalent.
Gigabyte‚Äôs decision 
to migrate its Aorus 
branding across from 
its gaming laptops to its 
motherboards seems like a 
no-brainer. Combining the classic 
Aorus style and motif with a crisp 
mat white Ô¨Ånish brings this board 
to the forefront of sleek system 
design. Couple that with a set of 
white Trident Z memory, and a 
few LEDs here and there, and it 
would be a dream in a black-and-
white themed build. On top of that, 
there‚Äôs a ton of connectivity, and 
solid thermals and power across 
the board. What‚Äôs not to love?

Is this the true king of 4K gaming? 
Well, it‚Äôs as close as you can get 
on a single card. The 1080 Ti, 
despite coming with a slightly 
silly spec (11GB of VRAM anyone?) 
is deÔ¨Ånitely the card to have if 
you‚Äôre looking to hit that AAA 
4K sweet spot. At least until the 
likes of Vega and Volta drop. On 
top of that, thanks to its CUDA 
core architecture, it syncs up 
exceptionally well with the likes 
of Adobe‚Äôs Creative Suite‚Äîmost 
notably Premiere Pro‚Äîmaking 
short work of all your HDR 
4K rendering loads. The only 
drawback to this build? We wish 
we had another.
At Ô¨Årst glance, the premium-
looking MasterCase Maker 5t 
checks a lot of our boxes. Capable 
of supporting coolers up to 
280mm in the front and roof, it‚Äôs 
a modular heaven, with multiple 
conÔ¨Ågurations available through 
Cooler Master‚Äôs in-house store. 
Unfortunately, it proved a bit 
more troublesome than we‚Äôd 
have liked once we got to building 
inside it, but it‚Äôs hard to deny the 
build quality CM has leveraged 
on this. Although the sharp lines 
and bold red coloring might not 
be to everyone‚Äôs tastes, it‚Äôs a top-
quality case, for people with very 
speciÔ¨Åc requirements.

AHH, THE BEAUTY of a modular power supply! Corsair‚Äôs 
RM series power supplies are a pretty affordable way of 
sprucing up any system. Although generally slightly longer 
than their non-modular cousins, being able to remove 
unnecessary cables from any build tends to make your life 
a lot easier. 
With the MasterCase Maker 5t, the rear power supply 
bracket can be installed prior to sliding the power 
supply itself into the back of the case. Simply unscrew the 
four thumbscrews holding the bracket to the chassis, then 
use the included power supply screws to mount the bracket 
to the rear of the PSU. Make sure the fan is facing down, 
because the 5t lacks any top-sided ventilation, then simply 
slide the power supply into the back of the case, and secure 
it using the four thumbscrews once more.
INSTALL THE POWER SUPPLY 
SO YOU‚ÄôVE GOT YOUR PARTS, a suitable workspace set up, free 
from static-inducing materials, a dependable set of tools, 
including a couple of Phillips head screwdrivers, a ton of cable 
ties, and you‚Äôre ready to go. First thing you‚Äôre going to want 
to do is strip down the chassis to the bare minimum. Not only 
does this give you a little extra room to maneuver, but it also 
encourages you to get rid of any unnecessary clutter, reducing 
potential airÔ¨Çow problems, or creating turbulent hotspots. 
Tempered glass and acrylic windowed panels are best 
placed in the cardboard box, slotted between the polystyrene 
to keep them protected. Most cases are relatively simple to take 
apart, but the 5t is another story. There‚Äôs a plethora of screws 
attaching the top panel to the chassis itself, all of varying shapes 
and sizes. As pictured, there‚Äôs also a radiator/fan mounting 
panel, held down by four retainable thumbscrews.

GOING FROM AN SSD TO A PCIE SSD is the equivalent of 
going from an old-school hard drive to an SSD for the Ô¨Årst 
time. The extra speed, although not particularly noticeable 
on startup, is astronomical on desktop. Copying and 
transferring Ô¨Åles around a PCIe SSD such as Samsung‚Äôs 
960 Pro is almost instant for anything less than 5GB.
Installation couldn‚Äôt be easier, either. Locate the M.2 
port on your board, Ô¨Ånd the screw opposite the port, and 
undo the tiny screw on the top of the mounting point. Next, 
make sure the stand-off is in the correct position for the 
size of M.2 SSD you have. If it‚Äôs in the wrong place, use a 
pair of needle-nose pliers to undo it, and screw it into the 
correct position. Then line your SSD up with the notch on 
both the stick and the connection, and slot it into place, 
before securing it with the M.2 screw.
ADD THE PCIE M.2 SSD
TRADITIONALLY, installing LGA processors tends to be a 
bit of a nightmare‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty of opportunity to bend 
those delicate motherboard pins, which can ultimately 
kill your trusty build. With PGA processors, on the other 
hand, it‚Äôs a far less dangerous business. Simply lift the 
retention arm up, match the golden triangle on the corner 
of the processor to the triangle on the socket, and carefully 
slot the processor into place. Wiggle it a bit, make sure it‚Äôs 
snug and secure, with each pin in each hole, then lower the 
retention arm back into place.
Needless to say, this can be done when the motherboard 
is outside the case, and it‚Äôs also the ideal time to install your 
AIO‚Äôs backplate to the motherboard. For this particular 
cooler, you need to unscrew the default AMD bracket, align 
the EK backplate with rubber mounting in between, then 
thread the correct screws through it to lock it into place.
INSTALL RYZEN AND AIO PREP
NEXT UP, YOU‚ÄôLL WANT to install the motherboard into the 
case. Lay the chassis down on its side, install the rear I/O plate, 
making sure to orient it correctly, then screw the motherboard 
into the stand-offs at all available screw holes. With a case like 
the 5t, you need to add the stand-offs yourself, depending on 
the size of the motherboard you‚Äôre using.
This is where things got interesting for us. Due to a lack of 
clearances in the roof, we couldn‚Äôt mount the EK Predator up 
above. After much shufÔ¨Çing, we opted to take the two 10TB 
HDDs out of the chassis, remove the HDD cage from the case, 
and install the Predator there, with the fans exhausting out of 
the front of the chassis. To mount the EK, simply apply a smidge 
of thermal paste to the center of the processor, place the four 
springs on each mounting screw, gently line the block over the 
top of the screws until it slides down over the processor, then 
screw the AIO down with the included thumbscrews.
MOBO AND AIO INSTALLATION
ALTHOUGH NOT AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, replacing the stock 
fans in any chassis with something a touch more premium helps 
improve overall performance. As standard, the 5t comes with 
three black Cooler Master 140mm fans‚Äîwe‚Äôve replaced them 
with three EK Vardar 120mm fans, to reduce noise and improve 
airÔ¨Çow and static pressure. 
The original plan was to have the two Vardars at the front of 
the chassis, drawing air into the case, one exhausting out of the 
rear, then to use the AIO EK Predator, exhausting out of the roof, 
running in a slightly negative conÔ¨Åguration. By the end of the 
build, our original plan had changed quite drastically, due to the 
limitations of the case itself‚Äîwe talk about that more in our AIO 
section below, and in the conclusion.

PLUG THE USB STICK into your new machine. Power on your 
PC, and hammer that Delete key to get into the BIOS. Head to 
the ‚ÄúBoot‚Äù menu, and make sure ‚ÄúUEFI [insert name of USB 
stick]‚Äù is your Ô¨Årst boot option. Then hit F10, save, and exit, 
and wait for the Windows installer to boot up. Go through 
the Windows setup option. Don‚Äôt worry when it asks you 
for your activation key‚Äîyou can skip this until later if you 
don‚Äôt have it immediately available. Choose which drive you 
wish to install the OS on (ideally your M.2 PCIe SSD), let it 
install, and then once it restarts, pull the USB stick out. 
Windows then gives you the usual privacy invading options 
(we suggest switching them all off), and asks you to sign in 
or create a Microsoft account, which you can skip.
With the Aorus, you need to install the appropriate 
network and chipset drivers. Head to Gigabyte‚Äôs website, 
search for your mobo, and download the latest versions 
under ‚ÄúSupport.‚Äù Then Google ‚ÄúAMD Ryzen drivers,‚Äù click 
the top link, and download the latest AM4 chipset drivers.
INSTALL THE OS AND DRIVERS
ONCE YOU‚ÄôVE FINISHED CABLING up your system, and have 
routed everything out of the way (following the manual 
for front I/O headers), you‚Äôll want to deal with lighting‚Äîor 
maybe not, depending on your point of view. For us, it‚Äôs part 
of what makes a system pop in a windowed chassis. 
There‚Äôs plenty of LED lighting in the MasterCase Maker 
5t already, with a long strip located on the PSU cover, and 
our Aorus is littered with the stuff. We would have loved to 
have thrown a couple of extra white LED strips in the roof, 
and along the back or front, to really bring attention to that 
white motherboard, perhaps even disabling that red bar at 
the bottom, so as not to swamp out the white color theme in 
a murky shade of rouge.
MORE LIGHTING 
SO, YOU‚ÄôVE GOT FRESH HARD DRIVES, everything‚Äôs ready to go, 
the system‚Äôs powering on, everything‚Äôs spinning, and you‚Äôre not 
getting any memory issues. What next? You‚Äôll want to install 
your OS. For us, that‚Äôs Windows 10‚Äôs Technical Preview. Ahead 
of time, utilizing a laptop or your old system, you need to take an 
8GB memory stick of some description, back up the documents 
on it elsewhere, and download the Windows Media Creation 
Tool from http://bit.ly/Win10MediaTool. Run the program, tell it 
you want to ‚ÄúCreate installation media for another PC,‚Äù choose 
which version you want to create a USB installer for, hit ‚ÄúNext,‚Äù 
then point it at your USB stick.
The tool then downloads the OS and creates a bootable USB 
stick, ready for your install. If you‚Äôre migrating a build, now 
is a good time to Ô¨Ånd your activation key, either in an email, if 
you bought your install direct from Microsoft, or on your last 
Windows CD.
MIGRATE A WINDOWS INSTALL
ALMOST AT THE END NOW. To install your graphics card, remove 
the two PCIe covers in the back of the chassis, where your 
card is going to slot in. These probably have two thumbscrews 
holding them in place. Then, lining the graphics card up with the 
slot, and with the rear I/O pointing to the back of the case, gently 
slot it into place until you hear a click. Then use those same 
thumbscrews that you removed earlier to secure the graphics 
card in place.
It‚Äôs a very similar affair for memory. Make sure you match 
the off-center notch on the stick with the board, lift the two clips 
either side of the memory slot, and gently slide the stick of RAM 
into place until you hear the two clips lock into place. Use the 
correct color coded slots if using only two sticks.

RYZING TO THE CHALLENGE
FRUSTRATING IS THE WORD with this one. 
AIO woes cut our enjoyment short midway 
through the build. Having to install our 
AIO in the front, because it was half an 
inch longer than the top mounting tray, 
was pure frustration, especially as the 
mobo and fans were already installed. On 
top of that, the fact that the front is now 
an exhaust goes against most common 
airÔ¨Çow conventions. It is possible to rotate 
the fans, but you need a particular set 
of hex keys that we didn‚Äôt have to hand. 
To compensate for this lack of positive 
pressure, we installed all three remaining 
fans (two in the roof and one in the rear) 
to draw into the chassis instead. Combined 
with the blower fan, it should lead to a 
mostly balanced system, and we‚Äôve yet to 
see any temperature anomalies.
To combat our hardware predicaments, 
we opted for an external NAS. The 2TB 
of applicable solid-state storage should 
be enough for any short-term content 
creation and Ô¨Åle transfers, and the 20TB 
of HDD storage in the WD My Cloud Ex 2 
Ultra should provide suitable backup for 
all long-term projects.
Having the PSU on rails, however, was 
a dream. Midway through the build, we 
decided to swap the stock cables for a set 
of black braided ones, and it was simply a 
case of pulling the PSU out, swapping the 
cables round, threading them through, and 
sliding it back into the chassis. 
But what about performance? We 
decided to slap a 4GHz overclock on all 
eight cores, to give the processor a little 
extra grunt in rendering tasks and single-
core IPC. What was disappointing was the 
memory overclocking. We struggled to get 
the memory to clock at 2,400MT/s, being 
forced to leave it at stock. Regardless of 
what timings we tinkered with, voltages we 
applied, or memory proÔ¨Åles, the Gigabyte 
X370 didn‚Äôt want to connect the dots.
As you‚Äôd expect, though, rendering 
performance was staggering, with nearly 
1,700 points in Cinebench R15 multi-
thread, and a solid 152 in single-thread. 
Backed up by 64GB of DDR4 and a 2TB 
PCIe SSD, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine this thing 
Ô¨Çying when rendering everyday tasks.
And gaming? Well, that was a mixed 
bag of potatoes. AMD is still clearly having 
issues with a few titles, our Total War: 
Attila being the most telling, scoring just 
36.2fps at 1080p. It‚Äôs an aggressive title, 
no doubt, but when you consider that a few 
issues ago an Intel Pentium G4600 and 
GTX 1060 trumped this setup by a frame, it 
shows that optimizations need to be made. 
Whether that‚Äôs on the OS or on AMD‚Äôs side 
for chipset, it makes little difference to us.
Ultimately, Ryzen is a monster when it 
comes to professional workloads, board 
manufacturers still have to get up to par 
with memory compatibility, and gaming 
performance at lower resolutions could do 
with a tweak. But, bang for buck, it‚Äôs damn 
near perfect, and will hopefully elicit a 
powerful response from Intel, too.
 
Our desktop zero-point PC uses a Core i7-6700K CPU @ 4.6GHz, an AMD R9 Fury X, and 32GB of RAM.  
All games are tested at 1080p on max settings, with HD texture packages installed.

A deep dive into AMD‚Äôs 
latest architecture BY ZAK STOREY
I
t‚Äôs not very often that we see such a 
monumental shake-up of the industry 
as we have with Ryzen. And God only 
knows, it‚Äôs something for which we‚Äôve 
been clamoring. Since AMD‚Äôs departure from 
high-end and even mainstream performance 
in 2012, Intel‚Äôs stranglehold on the consumer 
marketplace has stagnated development, 
whilst simultaneously pushing prices ever-
skyward for the same number of cores that 
we‚Äôve been getting for the last 11 years. 
That‚Äôs not to say it was entirely Intel‚Äôs 
fault‚Äîafter all, AMD didn‚Äôt wish to be in 
this position with its FX chips, and neither 
did Intel particularly expect its Core 
architecture design to be so successful. 
However, with little threat and no need to 
innovate, core count and IPC performance 
across Intel‚Äôs range stuttered, with‚Äîbesides 
enhanced connectivity support‚Äîsingle-core 
performance improving by less than ten a 
meager 8 percent on average, year to year, 
with every new generation of mainstream 
chips. So, what‚Äôs to blame? Incrementalism, 
board members, and investors. A lack of 
competition brought us to where we are 
today, because it‚Äôs far harder to ask for a 
greater R&D budget when you have no rivals 
than when you do. And it‚Äôs why Ryzen, as 
a whole, has arguably had more hype and 
fanfare than any other processor launch over 
the last 20 years.
For the Ô¨Årst time since 2009, consumers 
are back in a position where there‚Äôs choice 
in the market. It‚Äôs no longer simply a case of 
asking which Intel chip you can afford, but 
back to that old dilemma of whether you go 
team red or team blue. And, boy, have we 
missed that choice. Ryzen is nothing short 
of phenomenal. Its single-core performance 
is in line with Intel‚Äôs 2011-3 Broadwell-E 
chips, 
and 
its 
multicore 
performance 
is easily capable of outclassing its Intel 
counterparts‚Äîat a fraction of the cost.
The big question, then, is how has AMD 
managed to do this? And how does Ryzen‚Äôs 
architecture actually operate? Read on to 
Ô¨Ånd out more.

But what does all that mean? 
How do processors work? 
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to 
attempt to cover in brief here.
Now, before we get into 
AMD‚Äôs answer to Intel‚Äôs 
Hyper-Threading, we need 
to understand exactly how 
calculations and data are 
processed via the CPU. 
Generally speaking, software 
asks a series of complex 
questions, one at a time, 
(known as the program 
order), which traditionally the 
processor then calculates, 
one after the other in serial. 
However, because processors 
calculate problems far faster 
than they can draw data from 
DDR, SSDs, or hard drives, 
this can lead to delays, as 
data strings may not always 
be located on the processor‚Äôs

RYZEN 3
Due to be released during the second half of 
this year are AMD‚Äôs ‚Äúbudget‚Äù chips‚Äîrelatively 
speaking, of course. Expecting to come in four-
core variants, these low-power processors 
should be aimed at ofÔ¨Åce workstations and 
HTPCs, with budget gaming also on the cards. 
Note: The Ô¨Ågures below are entirely speculative.
RYZEN 5
It‚Äôs hard to miss the fact that Ryzen‚Äôs 5 series of processor is aiming its sights 
directly at the Intel Core i5 market. With its top-end chip topping out at six 
cores, 12 threads, and a whole whack of cache, this should be a good choice for 
any mainstream gamer going forward. And with AMD tactically holding these 
cores back until sufÔ¨Åcient OS optimization has occurred, it means those after a 
competitive gaming chip should see some solid performance, as opposed to the 
fragmented 1080p performance experienced by Ryzen 7.
Let‚Äôs cover the basics: What processors are going 
to be available under AMD‚Äôs new architecture?
cache, but somewhere else in 
the system.
Traditionally, it would 
go something like this: 
Calculation A provides answer 
B, which is used in calculation 
C, with data D drawn from 
DRAM, after which calculation 
E occurs. However, because 
we‚Äôre waiting on data D, we‚Äôre 
essentially stalling the unit, by 
not utilizing those execution 
units at 100-percent load. 
Out-of-order execution 
(OoOE) looks to rectify this by 
determining which instructions 
require data that‚Äôs stored in 
memory, establishing how 
long it will take to retrieve 
said data, then reordering the 
instructions so that instead of 
running in the original program 
order, it runs dependent on the 
availability of data. So, in our

scenario, it would go like this: 
Calculation E is Ô¨Årst, followed 
by calculation A, followed by 
calculation C, and by the time 
calculation C begins, hopefully 
enough clock cycles have 
passed for the processor to 
draw that absent data into the 
registers from the DRAM. The 
calculations that have been 
processed prior to the arrival 
of data D are held in what‚Äôs 
known as a retire queue, and 
once the Ô¨Ånal calculation has 
been completed, are then 
reordered and output back to 
the program via the processor. 
Branch prediction is the 
next step up from OoOE. This 
looks at each branch in a 
program‚Äôs code, analyzes it, 
then tries to predict which unit 
each branch of instructions 
should be placed into.

RYZEN 7
We‚Äôve covered Ryzen‚Äôs launch line of octo-core mainstream 
processors at length already. These eight-core, multithreaded 
rendering titans smash the competition on price to performance, 
although the chipset is somewhat weaker than both Z270 and 
X99 in comparison. Ryzen 7 has revolutionized the marketplace 
for the better‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre team red or blue, it‚Äôs hard to deny 
just how huge a difference these chips are going to make.
ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
Down to the nitty-gritty. What makes Ryzen tick? How does it work? 
What‚Äôs new? And what can users look forward to in the future? 
Back in 2011, AMD realized it was on the back foot with chip design, 
so it went back to the drawing board, drafting in the legendary Jim 
Keller to set out the groundwork for the chip‚Äôs architecture. 
CORE DESIGN
Analyzing the Ryzen 7 1800X, we can split it down on a core by core 
basis. Each Ryzen 7 CPU comes with eight cores in total. Each core 
comes with 32KB of D-cache (where the CPU stores data string load 
and store requests after processing), and 64KB of I-cache (where 
the CPU stores its instructions drawn from programs), commonly 
known together as the L1 cache. Additionally, each core has a block 
of 512KB of slightly slower L2 cache, which can be used to store 
both data and instruction sets simultaneously. On top of that, each 
core has four integer units, with 42 registers apiece, six schedulers, 
four ALUs, and two AGUs. Separate from the Integer Units, there 
are also two Floating Point Units, 72 out-of-order load supports, 
and, of course, two threads per core. Scale that up, and each block 
of four cores has a shared L3 cache of 8MB apiece, leading to a 
combined total of 16MB of L3 cache, and 4MB of L1/L2 cache for 
each and every eight-core processor‚Äîplus, of course, 16 threads 
via AMD‚Äôs SMT.
AGU Address Generation Unit. 
Found in the Integer Unit, the 
AGUs calculate the addresses 
of data strings stored in 
system media, whether that 
be cache, DDR, SSD, HDDs, or 
any other media. 
ALU Arithmetic Logic Unit. 
This is the part of a processor 
that calculates arithmetic and 
bitwise (binary) calculations, 
utilizing registers to do so. 
Branch Found in programs, 
these are instructions that 
inform the processor to begin 
executing a different instruction 
sequence within a program.
Floating Point Unit Similar 
to the Integer Unit (see 
later), the Floating Point Unit 
performs calculations on 
Ô¨Çoating point numbers, such 
as multiplications, divisions, 
square roots, and bit-shifting. 
These are split into separate 
execution units‚Äîin this 
case, two that deal with 
multiplication and two that 
deal with addition, with the 
rest of the less common 
calculations being dealt with 
on a software library level. 
The FPU is also known as an 
Execution Unit.
Integer Physical Register 
File Works in tandem 
with OoOE, withholding 
instructions from the 
execution units until they 
are needed.
Integer Unit The housing 
for both the ALUs and the 
AGUs. Also known as an 
Execution Unit.
Register Registers can hold 
both data and instructions, 
and are where a processor 
calculates a problem. For 
instance, an instruction set 
could be X + Y = Z, whilst the 
data would be the X and the 
Y. One register would hold 
the instruction, a second 
register holds the X, a third 
holds the Y, and lastly the 
result, Z, is held in a fourth, 
for further successive use in 
other calculations‚Äîor, if it‚Äôs 
no longer needed, it‚Äôs then 
pushed to the relevant cache 
for later use.

to graphics, Ryzen has an additional 
four dedicated to what AMD has termed 
‚Äúgeneral use‚Äù‚Äîin other words we‚Äôre talking 
about PCIe NVMe SSDs. 
In a way, this harks back to AMD‚Äôs old 
philosophy of ‚Äúupdate the processor not 
the motherboard.‚Äù Because most of the 
I/O support is now on the chip itself, those 
not wanting to upgrade their motherboard 
over the next couple of generations need 
not worry, while newer generations of chips 
will hopefully support a greater number of 
direct connect I/Os.
Having the PCIe 3.0 lanes on the chip 
like that eliminates the chipset itself as 
the middleman, and allows all Ryzen 
processors to have unfettered access to any 
connected SATA or NVMe devices‚Äîlikely 
the device providing the vast majority of 
program instructions to the processor. This 
reduces additional delays created by the 
intermediary chipset, and is a feature seen 
on Intel‚Äôs HEDT Extreme Edition line-up 
of processors. 
X370 CHIPSET
Now, that‚Äôs not to say the X370 chipset 
isn‚Äôt throwing its own punches. With native 
these two threads to be executed in tandem 
on the execution units that aren‚Äôt currently 
being utilized.
This tricks the operating system into 
thinking the processor has two cores, 
instead of the physical one. With Ryzen, 
only three parts of each core are statically 
partitioned and unavailable to both threads 
simultaneously: the Retire Queue, where 
the instructions are sent, ready to be 
reordered after OoOE has had its way; the 
Store queue, where AGUs temporarily 
store memory address allocations; and 
the Micro-Op Queue, where the decoded 
instructions are fed into the IU and the 
FPUs. Everything else that we‚Äôve previously 
discussed is available to both threads.
INTEGRATED I/O
So, what‚Äôs different this time around, 
compared to team blue? As far as we know, 
the vast majority of Ryzen CPUs feature a 
heavily integrated I/O on the chip itself. 
Unlike Intel, which only features 16 PCIe 
3.0 lanes in its mainstream processors, 
of which all are dedicated to graphics 
solutions, Ryzen has a total of 20 PCIe 3.0 
lanes. Still housing the same 16 dedicated 
A
nd so, we Ô¨Ånally get to look at 
AMD‚Äôs Simultaneous Multithreading. 
Although Intel was certainly the Ô¨Årst to 
the consumer market with its iteration 
of simultaneous multithreading‚ÄîHyper-
Threading‚ÄîAMD‚Äôs SMT operates in much 
the same way.
When most people think of a thread, 
they imagine it‚Äôs not that dissimilar from a 
core. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the arm that feeds the core most 
often‚Äù is a phrase repeated readily online. 
In reality, a thread is actually smaller than 
a process (think Task Manager). In fact, 
it‚Äôs deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúthe smallest sequence 
of programed instructions that can be 
managed independently by a scheduler.‚Äù 
Traditionally, a core processes one thread 
at a time. However, each instruction 
within each thread has varying degrees 
of difÔ¨Åculty, and the time required to 
calculate each part of that thread can‚Äôt just 
be solved by using things such as OoOE 
and Branch Prediction. So, Simultaneous 
Multithreading shares core resources 
between multiple threads‚Äîin this case, two 
simultaneously‚Äîand with a combination 
of algorithms and outright openly shared 
resources, allows the processor to allocate 
Simultaneous 
Multithreading  
and You
Each Ryzen processor is different, and SenseMi strives to Ô¨Åx that.
SMT, although not new to the scene, has been dominated by 
Intel‚Äôs Hyper-Threading‚Äîat least, until now

All the AM4 chipsets. Note: X300 and A300 chipsets, supporting ITX, will be released later this year.
support for USB 3.1, support for six USB 
3.0 devices, six USB 2.0 devices, four SATA 
6Gb/s, and an additional four SATA 6Gb/s 
or two SATA Express, there‚Äôs plenty on 
board to keep up with the latest innovations 
hitting mainstream storage, and to keep 
enthusiast builders happy. And, of course, 
that doesn‚Äôt include any support added by 
third-party chipset manufacturers.
Is it as inclusive as Intel‚Äôs Z270 or X99 
chipsets? No. Does it lack RAID 0/1 M.2 
PCIe support? Yes. But, to be honest, these 
are minor niggles, and for the vast majority 
of people‚Äîeven power users‚Äîit‚Äôs likely to 
matter very little.
SENSEMI SUITE
SenseMi is AMD‚Äôs latest optimization 
package, developed at a software level to 
take advantage of the Ryzen processors. 
It‚Äôs made up of Ô¨Åve separate parts: Pure 
Power, Precision Boost, XFR, Neural Net 
Prediction, and Smart Prefetch. 
‚Ä¢ Pure Power
Pure Power is an advanced form of power 
and temperature monitoring software. 
Each Ryzen processor has around 1,000 
sensors embedded across each chip, 
capable of detecting temperature and 
millivolt variances to an accuracy of one 
unit. This allows Ryzen, through learning 
algorithms, to adjust both frequency and 
voltages across the chip to efÔ¨Åciently lower 
power draw, without affecting performance. 
This sounds overly complex, but it has 
been put in place largely to mitigate the 
effects of the silicon lottery. Because every 
chip has its own unique characteristics, 
Pure Power can identify any potential 
problems, and work around them to deliver 
identical performance, with stronger power 
savings overall. 
‚Ä¢ Precision Boost
Think of Precision Boost as a smarter 
form of Intel‚Äôs Turbo technology. Unlike 
multiple cores. This works with air towers 
and AIO coolers, and increases the overall 
maximum clock speed by 100MHz, both at 
the full eight-core complement (boosting it 
up to 3.8GHz) and when two cores are being 
utilized (boosting up to 4.1GHz).
‚Ä¢ Neural Net Prediction
According to AMD, Neural Net Prediction 
is a ‚Äútrue artiÔ¨Åcial network inside every 
Is it as inclusive as Intel's Z270 or X99 
chipsets? No. Does it lack RAID 0/1 M.2 
support? Yes, but these are minor niggles.
Intel‚Äôs 100MHz increments, AMD has a 
total of 100 25MHz increments across its 
range, allowing for smart use of all eight 
cores, depending on workload, and in more 
granular increases than the competition, 
which improves stability. If we take the 
Ryzen 7 1800X, if only two cores are being 
used fully, Precision Boost bumps these two 
cores up to 4GHz‚Äîhowever, anything more 
than that, and it boosts all of the cores from 
its base frequency of 3.6GHz up to 3.7GHz. 
‚Ä¢ XFR (or Extended Frequency Range)
XFR is a further advancement of the 
Precision Boost software. However, it is 
based entirely on cooling, as opposed to 
utilization. If the processor detects that 
its temperatures remain below certain 
levels under load, it can auto overclock 
itself by an additional 100MHz across 
Zen processor.‚Äù In short, it‚Äôs supposed to 
build a model of the decisions driven by 
software code execution, anticipate future 
decisions, and preload instructions. So, 
hypothetically, the more you run a certain 
program, the better it will operate. Whether 
that‚Äôs true or not is difÔ¨Åcult to tell at this 
point in time.
‚Ä¢ Smart Prefetch
Smart Prefetch is in a very similar vein 
as Neural Net Prediction, anticipating 
the location of future data accesses by 
application code. Sophisticated learning 
algorithms model and learn application 
data 
access 
patterns, 
and 
prefetch 
vital data into the local cache, so it‚Äôs ready 
for immediate use. Once again, this is 
something that will develop over time and 
with regular use.

Delve deep into the hidden recesses of 
Windows with the help of Nick Peers
50 HIDDEN 
SECRETS OF 
WINDOWS 10
Y
ou can spend‚Äîand may already have 
spent‚Äîa lifetime trying to master Windows. 
Just when you get to grips with one version, 
out comes another. These days, things are further 
complicated by the fact that while Windows 10 
seems here to stay, it‚Äôs now undergoing more 
frequent changes, with a succession of major 
updates: Anniversary last year, Creator last month, 
and another (Windows 10.3, anyone?) slated for the 
end of the year. How do you possibly keep up?
The trick is to realize that the more things 
change, the more they stay the same, with many 
of the best tips and tricks that were uncovered 
during those halcyon days of Windows XP and 7 still 
relevant now. The problem is, where to Ô¨Ånd them?
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driven us to write this feature. 
We‚Äôve gone hunting for 50 of the most obscure‚Äî
but nevertheless useful‚Äîtips we can Ô¨Ånd. We‚Äôve 
rooted out new techniques for old favorites, and 
also uncovered some new features that may not 
have made the headlines when the Creator‚Äôs Update 
appeared, but will still help improve the way you use 
Windows. One of the joys of researching and writing 
this kind of feature is uncovering secrets that we‚Äî
the so-called experts‚Äîweren‚Äôt aware of. You know 
you‚Äôre on the right track when you stumble upon 
tips that save you time and prove useful to your 
own computing life, and more than a few of those 
revealed themselves.
We‚Äôre conÔ¨Ådent that you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd at least one tip in 
this collection that will transform the way you use 
your PC. But mindful of providing value for money, 
we‚Äôve decided 50 isn‚Äôt enough. You‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd three 
additional boxes scattered through the feature, 
each one revealing bonus secrets you can use to 
save time and speed up the way you use your PC. 
We discover how to quickly access system settings 
without wading through menus and dialog boxes,  
we uncover some Registry shortcuts that enable 
you to change the way Windows looks and behaves, 
and we Ô¨Ånish off by revealing lesser known‚Äîbut 
still immensely useful‚Äîkeyboard shortcuts.
Ready? Dust down your fedora, Dr Jones, we‚Äôre 
going on a treasure hunt.

Windows 10

1
CUSTOMIZE ‚ÄúQUICK LINK‚Äù MENU
Add your own custom shortcuts to 
the menu that appears when you 
right-click the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button. Use 
the portable Win+X Menu Editor 
tool 
(http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.
news.30) to add programs, control panel applets, 
and other system shortcuts, plus organize them all 
into groups.
2
CREATE GODMODE
Create a new folder and name it as 
shown below (you can change the 
‚ÄúGodMode‚Äù part if you like):
GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-
825C-99712043E01C}
This gives you easy access to every single control 
panel applet via a convenient list‚Äîwhy not add it to 
your ‚ÄúQuick Link‚Äù menu?
3
VIEW USAGE BY DRIVE
Windows 10 provides you with a handy 
way of seeing what kind of content is 
taking up space on each of your drives. 
Navigate to ‚ÄúSettings > System > 
Storage,‚Äù and tap a drive to see a breakdown of content 
by type. The Creator‚Äôs Update also introduces a ‚ÄúStorage 
Sense‚Äù button, which automatically clears temporary 
Ô¨Åles, and Ô¨Åles residing in the bin for over 30 days.
4
MOVE APPS TO ANOTHER DRIVE
Running out of space on your system 
drive? Move existing Windows Store 
apps to another drive or partition via 
‚ÄúSettings > Apps‚Äù‚Äîselect the app, 
and click ‚ÄúMove‚Äù to select your target drive. Force all 
new apps to install to a speciÔ¨Åed drive by switching 
to the ‚ÄúStorage‚Äù section, and tapping ‚ÄúChange where 
new content is saved.‚Äù
5
MOVE ANY PROGRAM
Why stop with Windows Store apps 
when you can move any installed 
desktop program? Download Steam 
Mover 
from 
www.traynier.com, 
and run it as an administrator. Point ‚ÄúSteam Apps 
Common Folder‚Äù to your Program Files folders, 
then select an alternative folder on your target drive 
(which must be formatted NTFS). Once done, select 
each program you wish to move, and click the right 
arrow button to move them across. Clever use of 
‚ÄúJunction Points‚Äù ensure the programs continue to 
work even from another drive, and you can always 
move them back if needed.
6
RESTRICT DRIVE USAGE
Prevent shared users from hogging 
all available drive space by setting 
up drive-based quotas (again NTFS-
formatted drives only). Open ‚ÄúFile 
Explorer > This PC,‚Äù right-click your target drive, 
and choose the ‚ÄúProperties > Quota‚Äù tab. Click 
‚ÄúShow Quota Settings,‚Äù and check ‚ÄúEnable quota 
management,‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúDeny disk space to users 
exceeding quota limit,‚Äù and select ‚ÄúLimit disk space 
to.‚Äù Set your limit (probably in GB) and a warning (say 
10‚Äì20 percent less than the limit), then click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù
7
RESTRICT USAGE ON PER-USER BASIS
To set limits for individual users, leave 
‚ÄúDo not limit disk usage‚Äù selected, 
and click ‚ÄúQuota Entries‚Äù instead. 
Select ‚ÄúQuota > New Quota Entry.‚Äù 
Click ‚ÄúAdvanced,‚Äù then ‚ÄúFind Now‚Äù to list all available 
users. Select a name from the list, and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù 
twice. Set their quota and warning limits, then repeat 
for other users for whom you wish to apply limits. 
Once done, close the window, and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù twice.
8
TAKE OWNERSHIP QUICKLY
Need to reclaim ownership of a Ô¨Åle 
or folder? Add a convenient shortcut 
to the right-click menu: download 
www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/
Place your own custom 
shortcuts on the ‚ÄúQuick 
Access‚Äù menu.
Move any app to another drive using SteamMover.
Stop users hogging 
space by setting 
drive quotas.

double-click ‚ÄúInstallTakeOwnership.reg,‚Äù clicking 
‚ÄúRun‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù and Ô¨Ånally ‚ÄúOK‚Äù when 
prompted. Now right-click any folder or Ô¨Åle to Ô¨Ånd a 
new ‚ÄúTake Ownership‚Äù option.
9
TASK VIEW SHORTCUTS
Press Win-Tab to trigger Task View, 
where you can easily move windows 
between multiple virtual desktops. 
Press Ctrl-Win-D to quickly create 
(and switch to) a new virtual desktop, and Ctrl-Win-
left/right cursor to move between them.
10
GROUP WINDOWS BY TAB
Task View too awkward? Download 
and install TidyTabs (www.nurgo-
software.com/products/tidytabs), 
and you can group multiple windows 
together in a single tabbed window‚Äîjust like your 
browser, except it covers all apps, and you can mix 
and match different programs, too.
11
SWITCH DEFAULT VIEW
When you open a new File Explorer 
window, it defaults to the ‚ÄúQuick 
Access‚Äù menu. Change this by going to 
the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù tab on the Explorer ribbon, 
and choosing ‚ÄúFolder & Search Options.‚Äù Click ‚ÄúOpen 
File Explorer to‚Ä¶‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúThis PC‚Äù to change 
the default action to showing your user folders, 
drives, and network locations.
12
TWEAK ‚ÄúQUICK ACCESS‚Äù FOLDER
You can also customize the ‚ÄúQuick 
Access‚Äù folder from here, too, by 
selectively removing both recently 
used Ô¨Åles and frequently accessed 
folders from its view if you wish‚Äîthis leaves only 
those shortcut folders that you speciÔ¨Åcally pin to 
the menu.
13
BACKGROUND SCROLLING
This feature enables you to scroll any 
program window using your mouse or 
trackpad, by moving the cursor over 
it, even when it‚Äôs not in focus. Toggle 
it on and off via the ‚ÄúScroll inactive windows when I 
hover over them‚Äù switch under ‚ÄúSettings > Devices 
> Mouse and Touchpad.‚Äù
14
CONTROL FROM TASKBAR
The Aero Peek feature provides you 
with a convenient way to preview open 
app and program windows, without 
bringing them into focus, but it can 
provide other shortcuts, too. Take the Groove Music 
app, for example‚Äîroll your mouse over its Taskbar 
icon, and the Aero Peek preview contains playback 
controls you can use without bringing the main 
program into focus.
15
SNAP APP WINDOWS
Snap Assist makes it even easier to 
snap multiple windows in place. Snap 
your Ô¨Årst window in place by dragging 
it to the edge or corner of the screen, 
at which point all other windows appear as they do 
when in Task View. You can then drag these into place, 
bring them into focus, or even close them quickly 
and easily.
16
MORE COLOR CHOICES
The Creator‚Äôs Update gives you more 
control over your color scheme when 
tweaking your desktop. Go to ‚ÄúSettings 
> Personalization > Colors,‚Äù and 
click ‚ÄúCustom Color.‚Äù Use the color picker to choose 
your color, then adjust it with the help of a slider and 
preview (complete with a warning, should the colors 
be difÔ¨Åcult to read).
TidyTabs groups app 
windows into tabs, like 
your browser does.
Control playback 
from the Taskbar 
with Groove Music.
Choose your own 
custom color 
scheme with the 
Creator‚Äôs Update.

TWEAK NOTIFICATION SETTINGS
Fed up with certain apps constantly 
badgering 
you 
with 
notiÔ¨Åcations 
through the Action Center? Go to 
‚ÄúSettings > System > NotiÔ¨Åcations & 
actions,‚Äù then scroll down to pick and choose exactly 
what apps and services get to notify you.
18
REMEMBER, REMEMBER
If you frequently forget something 
within moments of thinking it, Cortana 
could prove to be your lifesaver. 
Simply type (or speak) ‚Äúremember‚Äù 
to set up a reminder from scratch, or try something 
such as ‚Äúremember to get milk tomorrow after work‚Äù 
to include additional details.
19
DISABLE CORTANA
The quickest way to disable Cortana 
(although the process itself still runs 
in the background) is via a security 
policy setting‚Äîopen Registry Editor, 
browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\
Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsSearch, 
and 
create a new DWORD value named ‚ÄúAllowCortana.‚Äù 
Leave it set to 0, restart Windows Explorer via Task 
Manager, and it‚Äôs disabled.
20
YOUR NEW SEARCH BOX
Once Cortana is disabled, the Search 
box displays ‚ÄúSearch Windows,‚Äù and 
you can continue to use it to Ô¨Ånd apps, 
settings, and Ô¨Åles on your PC‚Äîtap 
‚ÄúFilters‚Äù to choose speciÔ¨Åc things to search for, such 
as folders, documents, or music. (While we‚Äôre on the 
subject, right-click the Taskbar, and choose ‚ÄúSearch 
> Show search icon‚Äù to replace the Search box with a 
simple search button.)
21
MASTER FILE ASSOCIATIONS
The quickest way to change a single 
Ô¨Åle type‚Äôs association is to right-click a 
Ô¨Åle in File Explorer, then choose ‚ÄúOpen 
With > Choose another app.‚Äù Be sure 
to select ‚ÄúAlways use this app to open‚Ä¶‚Äù before going 
through the list to Ô¨Ånd your chosen app (if it‚Äôs not 
displayed, click ‚ÄúMore apps,‚Äù then scroll down to the 
bottom, and click ‚ÄúLook for another app on this PC‚Äù).
22
SWITCH DEFAULT PROGRAMS
There‚Äôs little choice to be had at 
‚ÄúSettings > Apps > Default apps,‚Äù 
but scroll down and you can choose 
‚ÄúSet defaults by app‚Äù to gain access 
to a much wider range of apps. Select one to quickly 
assign multiple Ô¨Åle types to it via ‚ÄúChoose defaults for 
this program.‚Äù
23
SAVE BANDWIDTH
There are many ways in which you 
can stop Windows wasting precious 
bandwidth when connected to a 
metered network, all accessible via 
Settings. First, go to ‚ÄúUpdate & Security > Windows 
Create your own 
quick shortcuts to 
system tools.
Shortcuts to System Settings
Why go hunting for speciÔ¨Åc settings or control panel applets when‚Äîarmed 
with the right shortcuts‚Äîyou can jump straight to them? The following 11 
shortcuts work when entered in the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù dialog box (press Win-R) or when 
creating a shortcut:
More examples can be found at www.lifewire.com/shortcuts-2626060, or

Fans are simple enough, right? 
Not quite. There are a few things 
you need to learn before you can 
pick with confidence. By Chris Lloyd
PASS ELECTRICITY through 
a conductor, and it gets 
hot. All the little electrons 
bump 
into 
things 
and 
transfer energy. This bit 
of basic physics is useful for an electric 
Ô¨Åre, but a real annoyance for your 
silicon, which needs to be kept cool. Back 
in the day, the only fan you might have 
had on a computer was in the power 
supply, blowing hot air out. The Intel 486 
was the Ô¨Årst processor to need a fan of 
its own, on the faster versions anyway. 
The original Pentium could just about 
manage on passive cooling in its slower 
incarnations, but was likely to pop under 
load if you weren‚Äôt careful (no universal 
fail-safe thermal cut-oÔ¨Äs back then‚Äîif 
you overheated it, you may well have 
killed it). Since then, every chip has 
needed dedicated cooling. Graphics cards 
soon started to get too hot to run unaided, 
too. The fans got bigger, and spread. Now, 
some motherboard chipsets, drives, and 
even memory modules sport fans. And 
case fans have proliferated into banks 
of spinning LED lights all over the case. 
If you run an unmodiÔ¨Åed rig, the fans 
it came with will work well enough, 
albeit too noisily for comfort. If nothing 
else, a good fan is quieter. If you start 
upgrading and overclocking, adequate 
cooling is imperative‚Äîtime to add new 
fans. At least they‚Äôre simple. Actually, 
like every aspect of PCs, fans have their 
own speciÔ¨Åcations and variations in 
design and function, so there are a few 
things it would be useful to know Ô¨Årst. 
Although getting the ‚Äúright‚Äù number and 
position is still something of a dark art.

THE SPECIFICATIONS
The primary stats to look for are¬†how 
much air the fan can shift, and 
how much noise it makes. AirÔ¨Çow 
is measured in CFM‚Äîcubic feet per 
minute. The fan‚Äôs ‚Äúpush‚Äù or static 
pressure is usually quoted using 
the delightfully archaic measure 
of millimeters of water. Higher 
is better. Noise level is measured 
in dB, a similarly obscure value, 
which takes careful reading (see 
box below). Among the specs you‚Äôll 
also Ô¨Ånd its maximum rotational 
speed, bearing type, control method, 
MTBF, blade design, and anything 
else the marketing men think you 
might be interested in, or impressed 
by, including fancy rubber mounts, 
color schemes, and LED lights.
The most basic stat is size. Case 
and processor fans have been 
getting bigger‚Äî80 and 92mm soon 
grew to 120 and 140mm, then 200 
and 230mm. A bigger fan means 
lower speed for the same airÔ¨Çow, 
so if you have room, go big. Unless 
you fancy cutting holes, your case 
deÔ¨Ånes how many and what size 
you can Ô¨Åt. A decent case oÔ¨Äers a 
good choice of number and position.
Next is the most basic function 
of any fan: moving air. CFM is 
an 
intuitive 
measurement. 
A 
120mm fan can shift 40‚Äì100 CFM, 
depending on its blade design and 
rotational speed. This is a wide 
range, which isn‚Äôt terribly helpful 
information on its own. The big 200 
and 230mm case fans can move 
more air‚Äî100‚Äì150 CFM‚Äîand, more 
importantly, do it at lower speeds. 
How much air do you need to 
shift? Opinion is divided; there‚Äôs a 
huge number of variables at play 
here, but, very roughly, around 50 
CFM or so should keep everything 
frosty enough on a fairly standard 
rig. If you‚Äôve been tinkering and 
upgrading, 
you 
might 
like 
to 
bump that up a bit. You won‚Äôt need 
hundreds, though. 
The internal layout has a huge 
impact on airÔ¨Çow: The tighter 
and more restrictive the interior 
space is, the harder the fans have 
to work, and the more likely it is 
that you‚Äôll get hotspots. The CFM 
Ô¨Ågure is measured on a completely 
unobstructed fan, too‚Äîas soon as 
you add some back pressure, the 
performance drops oÔ¨Ä. 
It‚Äôs also worth remembering to 
match your input and output fans. 
Tweaking these values can give 
you a negative or positive pressure 
inside your case. The jury is out on 
which is best, or whether it makes 
much diÔ¨Äerence at all. The idea is 
that if you push more air into your 
PC, it‚Äôs pressurized a little, which 
stops air Ô¨Ånding its way through 
cracks and gaps, and bringing in 
dust. In theory, it keeps the inside 
nice and clean, assuming you‚Äôve 
got eÔ¨Äective air Ô¨Ålters over the 
input fans. Detractors point out that 
it can lead to a build up of heat, and 
doesn‚Äôt really work well anyway. 
A fan‚Äôs static pressure is how 
much force it can apply to the 
airÔ¨Çow. You don‚Äôt need to know 
how or why this is measured in 
millimeters of water, just know that 
more is better. A typical 120mm case 
fan runs to 1.0‚Äì2.0mm. A high static 
pressure fan is good for forcing air 
into all the nooks and crannies of 
your machine, or through a radiator 
attached to a water cooler, say. 
AirÔ¨Çow, 
air 
pressure, 
and 
rotational speed are all related, and 
there‚Äôs a trade-oÔ¨Ä involved. Fans are 
often designated as ‚Äústatic pressure‚Äù 
or ‚ÄúairÔ¨Çow,‚Äù designed to maximize 
THE DECIBEL
The standard 
unit used to 
deÔ¨Åne how much 
noise something makes 
is the decibel, dB. This 
unit dates back to the 
days of the telegraph, 
and is named in honor 
of Alexander Graham 
Bell. As the name also 
suggests, it is equal to a 
tenth of a bel, a unit you 
won‚Äôt see used anywhere 
these days. It was 
devised to quantify signal 
loss over the wires. 
Best known for its use 
in acoustics, it can also 
be applied to voltages 
in electronics, radar, 
radio Ô¨Åeld strengths, and 
more. Most importantly, 
it is not a linear scale. It‚Äôs 
logarithmic‚Äîa ratio of 
two values: the one you 
want to measure and a 
reference value, which, 
in the case of acoustics, 
is silence. A logarithmic 
scale may have suited its 
original purposes well, 
but makes it a confusing 
unit for everyday use. A 
difference of six decibels 
is equal to a doubling 
of air pressure. You 
might think that means a 
sound twice as loud, but 
because of the way 
the brain processes 
sound, that doesn‚Äôt 
follow. The perceived 
volume doubles at 
around 10dB difference. 
Small differences 
in decibels equal a big 
difference in noise. 
A fan at full bore can 
make 30dB or more, an 
intrusive level in a quiet 
room, equivalent 
to somebody 
constantly 
whispering in your ear. 
What manufacturers 
consider ‚Äúquiet‚Äùvaries, 
but look for under 25dB. 
Properly quiet would 
be under 20dB, about 
the same as leaves 
gently rustling in the 
wind. Less than 10dB is 
very quiet indeed, 
like somebody 
breathing. The human 
ear is more sensitive 
to certain frequencies, 
which makes a 
straight dB rating an 
imperfect measure of 
the obtrusiveness of a 
sound. It may only be as 
loud as rustling leaves, 
but it‚Äôs an annoying high-
pitched whine, too. It‚Äôs 
also worth remembering 
that adding dB values 
isn‚Äôt linear either‚Äîtwo 
fans of the same decibel 
level are 3dB louder in 
total. That‚Äôs another 
reason for going for 
two fans over a single 
more powerful, but 
louder, one.

static pressure or CFM respectively. 
This boils down to the design of the 
rotor blades. Static pressure fans 
have thick blades with narrow 
gaps, leaving the air little place to 
go but through the fan, but less air 
is shifted with each rotation. On 
the exhaust side, the airÔ¨Çow tends 
to spread out into a cone. These are 
usually recommended for front case 
input fans, or if you have to mount 
the fan in a conÔ¨Åned space. 
Blades designed for maximum 
airÔ¨Çow are much thinner‚Äîyou can 
get your Ô¨Ångers between them on a 
120mm. The exhaust Ô¨Çow is tighter 
and more directional‚Äîhandy if 
you have a speciÔ¨Åc hotspot to cool. 
They are usually recommended as 
rear-mounted exhaust fans, good 
at shifting large volumes quickly 
against minimal back pressure. 
Hybrid designs mix blade shapes 
as a compromise 
between the two 
approaches, 
and 
often recommended as CPU fans.
The 
maximum 
quoted 
rpm 
is not quite as important as it 
sounds. Depending on the blade 
design, it deÔ¨Ånes the maximum 
airÔ¨Çow and pressure values. To 
keep things quiet and unstressed, 
you don‚Äôt really want to run at full 
tilt anyway. The noise it makes 
at typical operating speeds is 
important, though; a noisy fan is 
always an annoying fan. Better to 
have a big one or multiples working 
lazily, than one blowing its heart 
out to reach the cooling you need. 
On variable speed fans, you have a 
maximum and minimum dB level. 
The lower Ô¨Ågure is as useful to 
know as the maximum‚Äîit gives 
you a good idea of how much quieter 
it is running below its maximum.
BEARING DOWN
Now for bearings. Old-school sleeve 
bearings have been around in one 
FUTURE COOLING 
Is there a better 
way to cool 
things down 
than the positively 
ancient technology of 
a fan? There have been 
plenty of ideas. How 
about using ionic wind? 
It has no moving parts at 
all. It works by creating 
a Ô¨Çow of air using a thin 
ionizing anode and a 
large cathode. MIT and 
NASA have played with 
the technology as a 
possible low-emission 
replacement for jet 
engines, but so far 
nothing much has come 
of it, due to low thrust 
densities. There have 
been some lovely home-
brew experiments on 
PCs that appear to work. 
The main, and absolutely 
huge, drawback is 
the massive voltages 
required‚Äînot something 
you want inside a PC. 
Another cooler with 
no moving parts uses the 
Peltier or thermoelectric 
effect. This consists 
of a sandwich of 
different materials‚Äî
typically, carefully 
arranged p and n-type 
semiconductors‚Äî
which has a current 
passed across it. Heat 
is transferred from one 
side to the other as the 
material tries to Ô¨Ånd 
equilibrium among the 
electrons. It can heat or 
cool, depending on which 
way round you place it. 
It all works well enough, 
but it‚Äôs not the most 
efÔ¨Åcient of systems, 
the cooling effect isn‚Äôt 
very strong (about 20 
degrees difference), 
and it requires quite 
a bit of power. The 
heat isn‚Äôt taken very 
far away either‚Äîjust 
across a relatively thin 
material. On a processor, 
you would still need 
something on the other 
side of your Peltier 
cooler to carry the heat 
further away. There is 
potential, but it has yet to 
prove itself in anything 
other than specialist 
applications. They may 
be as old as the hills, but 
fans are cheap and do the 
job. A good combination. 
Unfortunately, the ion thruster from NASA proved 
impractical outside the world of space probes.
Corsair‚Äôs ML120  
fans produce 
a staggering 
4.2mmH2O at 
37dBA. But 
thanks to a 
400rpm running 
speed, set these 
to spin at a low 
rpm and they 
still pump out 
some serious 
pressure. Ideal 
for any radiator, 
AIO, or air tower.

pressure, while the thinner blades are aimed at maximizing airÔ¨Çow.

form or another since the pharaohs. 
These use a lubricated tubular 
sleeve around the drive shaft. 
They don‚Äôt like high temperatures, 
or being oriented anything but 
vertically. However, they are cheap 
and can be quiet, particularly when 
new. After a while, the lubricant 
dries out and the fan gets noisy. 
They also have an unpleasant 
habit of failing rather suddenly; 
if it starts to squeal, it could be 
on borrowed time. The lifespan 
drops at higher temperatures, too, 
because heat aÔ¨Äects the viscosity 
of the lubricant, typically halving 
between 25 and 50 C.
The next best thing is a ball 
bearing. The Romans used simple 
versions, and Leonardo da Vinci 
sketched a ball bearing as part of 
his helicopter design. However, 
it wasn‚Äôt until 1794 that we had 
a modern design. Here, the drive 
shaft is surrounded by ring of small 
ball bearings, held in contact by an 
outer tube. The ball bearings rotate 
individually, and around the shaft. 
This lowers friction. It‚Äôs a sealed 
unit, so the lubrication dries out 
more slowly than sleeve bearings. 
Ball bearings last a good deal longer 
and tolerate higher temperatures 
better than sleeve bearings, too, as 
well as being tolerant to orientation. 
Fluid bearings immerse the 
shaft in a lubricating liquid to 
lower friction. They can have an 
excellent lifespan and be very 
quiet. The original FDB, Ô¨Çuid 
dynamic bearings, came from the 
world of hard drives, and feature 
a riÔ¨Çed or grooved inner surface to 
the bearing to keep the lubricant 
moving. The drive shaft spins 
in a thin layer of lubricant‚Äî
essentially, 
a 
modiÔ¨Åed 
sleeve 
bearing. However, this design is 
patented, so similar but subtly 
diÔ¨Äerent designs have appeared, 
going under various names. Hydro 
dynamic‚Äîor simply hydraulic‚Äî
bearings are similar in design 
and 
operation. 
RiÔ¨Çed 
bearings 
range from simple modiÔ¨Åed sleeve 
bearings that are of questionable 
value to more sophisticated designs 
MAGNETIC LEVITATION
A weak point of 
a bearing is the 
point of contact 
between the surface 
of the drive shaft and 
the bearing‚Äîhowever 
clever the design, 
two surfaces moving 
at different speeds 
creates friction, noise, 
and vibrations. Enter 
the use of magnetic 
levitation, which 
effectively removes any 
contact. The shaft and 
fan assembly is held in 
magnetic suspension by 
a ring of electromagnets, 
and rotated by pulses 
of changing polarity 
around the ring. No 
contact means precious 
little noise and wear. It 
also enables the fan to 
rotate accurately around 
its center of gravity, 
eliminating vibration. 
No contact also greatly 
improves reliability.
The idea for maglev 
bearings has been 
around since the early 
1940s, and was proposed 
for the high-speed 
centrifuges used to 
enrich uranium for the 
Manhattan Project. 
However, it took until the 
1970s before commercial 
applications emerged; 
these include maglev 
trains, and pumps for 
use in space, artiÔ¨Åcial 
hearts, and other 
extreme environments. 
Now the technology 
has Ô¨Åltered down to the 
relatively humble fan 
in a PC, thanks largely 
to cheap solid-state 
controllers. It sounds 
just great, but we‚Äôve 
yet to be properly 
impressed. So far, just 
Corsair and Sunon have 
tried the technology‚Äî
Corsair to the greater 
acclaim. Its ML range 
can spin to 2,400rpm, 
although at 37dB, you 
might not want them to 
for long. It‚Äôs still early 
days for this technology 
in PC fans, and we hope 
to see more and better 
to follow. 
Same principles as a maglev bearing, and with the 
same aim: reduce friction and go faster.
The Be Quiet! 120mm Silent Wings 3 puts 
out just 16.4dB, yet shifts over 50CFM.
Artic‚Äôs F12 
Silent is a 
Ô¨Åxed-speed 
DC fan, but 
at 20.5dB, it 
delivers over 
38CFM using a 
Ô¨Çuid bearing.

that approach the eÔ¨Äectiveness of 
the¬†original. 
That used to be pretty much it, 
but magnetic levitation bearings 
have started to appear (see box 
below-left). These radically reduce 
friction again. Once the province 
of major engineering projects, such 
as high-speed centrifuges, the tech 
has dropped into the mainstream. 
Corsair 
launched 
a 
range 
of 
magnetic levitation fans last year. 
Magnetic levitation bearings have 
yet to make much impact, though ‚Äî
the technical advantages are there 
to be had, but not fully realized.
CONTROL
There are two main forms of control: 
DC and PWM. A basic DC fan takes 
your 12V supply, runs it through 
the fan, and oÔ¨Ä you go. It works Ô¨Åne, 
but you have a Ô¨Åxed speed‚Äîit‚Äôs 
either on or oÔ¨Ä, and that‚Äôs about it. 
DC fans have three-pin connectors. 
You can reduce the voltage with a 
simple potentiometer‚Äîa variable 
resistor between the PSU and fan, 
once very popular with modders. It 
adds direct control over fan speed, 
but you are on your own when you 
set the level of cooling, it wastes 
power, and generates its own heat. 
Enter pulse width modulation, or 
PWM. This adds another pin to the 
connector to carry a control signal, 
which enables precise software 
control of fan speed. It works by very 
quickly switching power on and oÔ¨Ä 
at modulated intervals. Because the 
fan is still getting the full 12V, it 
can be controlled down to very low 
speeds; a DC fan would start to stall 
as voltages drop toward 5V. Every 
decent motherboard has at least one 
PWM header, and you should use it. 
Some fans have integrated speed 
controls, enabling you to select a 
speed proÔ¨Åle or a set of Ô¨Åxed speeds. 
PWM control makes this feature 
largely redundant. PWM enables 
your system to react to sudden 
changes in load seamlessly. 
Every fan will die at some point. 
Fans have an MTBF rating: mean 
time before failure, the average 
lifespan. If it‚Äôs going into a very 
important system on a remote 
island, longevity is worth careful 
consideration. 
Otherwise, 
some 
simple math shows us that, given 
modern fans‚Äô high reliability, it‚Äôs 
not as important as it once was. A 
cheap sleeve bearing fan might 
only last 30,000 hours, but decent 
fans run to 100,000 or 200,000, 
and more. Even a very modest 
50,000-hour fan will last 5.7 years 
of continuous use. Will you still be 
running the same system in 2022? 
What‚Äôs left? Some system of 
vibration damping using silicone 
rubber mounts is desirable. Fancy 
sculpted airÔ¨Çow around the fan 
case can squeeze tiny beneÔ¨Åts out 
of performance, and there are a few 
spurious claims made for oddly 
shaped and toothed blades, which 
may, or may not, hold water.
Lastly we have aesthetics. Fancy 
colored plastics and transparent 
parts can look funky, but best of 
all are LEDs. These are so cheap 
now that even budget fans often 
come festooned with tiny lights. 
Not funky enough? How about RGB 
lights, an array of customizable 
multi-colored lights that can be set 
to Ô¨Çash, strobe, fade between colors, 
and more? Pointless but great fun.
How much? A basic sleeve 
bearing DC 120mm fan with an 
LED or two is under Ô¨Åve bucks, but 
you don‚Äôt want that. A decent ball 
bearing Noctua is about $20, and a 
magnetic levitation Corsair with 
fancy lights is $25. Given what 
you are likely to spend on the rest 
of your hardware, especially your 
graphics card, this is small change. 
You may as well buy decent ones, 
and Ô¨Åt enough capacity so none has 
to strain itself. Running cool helps 
everything last longer. 
It‚Äôs easy to go overboard. One 
case fan at the front and one at the 
back might be enough for most uses, 
but adding more is tempting, and 
doubling up won‚Äôt hurt, especially 
on a high-power gaming rig. 
There is a law of diminishing 
returns at work, though. Once 
you‚Äôve got decent airÔ¨Çow over 
all the components, adding extra 
fans does little more than make it 
look fancier. There is a limit to the 
airspeed you can achieve over any 
component from a 12V fan; adding 
too many or badly positioned ones 
can cause turbulence and heat 
traps, and set fans working against 
each other, especially if you add 
them to every case opening. 
If in doubt, experiment. Software 
can monitor how hot your processor 
and graphics card are running. Try 
changing the position of your fans, 
and adjusting the speeds. There are 
few hard and fast rules, and lots of 
common sense, such as keeping the 
paths for incoming air and exhaust 
air clearly delineated, and not 
putting inputs at the top or near the 
PSU output. 
Your rig can never run too cool 
or too quietly. It might cope with 
a couple of basic fans, but there is 
something wonderfully reassuring 
about having a good set of fans 
quietly whirring away. It‚Äôs cool. 
Thermaltake‚Äôs 
colorful Riing 
range features 
hydraulic 
bearings and 
256 or 16.8 
million color 
RGB lights, 
controllable 
from software. 
Corsair‚Äôs HD maglevs 
feature a fancy RGB 
lighting controller on 
top of the bearings.

X99 VS. 
X370
It‚Äôs that time of the year again‚Äî
summer‚Äôs coming up, and I have the 
inevitable urge to jump into liquid 
cooling once more with a brand new 
system of my very own. I alluded to my 
copper dreams last issue, but this time 
I wanted to talk more about the spec. 
Processor choice, in particular. That‚Äôs 
nice to say: choice. It‚Äôs neat to have 
choice. AMD or Intel; Ryzen or 2011-3; 
X370 or X99. 
Yep, I‚Äôm looking to go with a high-
end desktop processor this time 
around. I need to get myself one of 
those lairy eight-cores. Naturally, the 
two choices on hand are AMD‚Äôs 1800X 
and Intel‚Äôs i7-6900K. Both have eight 
cores, both pack 20MB of cache, and 
both pump out some phenomenal 
multi-threaded and single-core 
performance, given their specs. 
The problem for me, however, is 
chipset. We‚Äôve spoken in depth this 
issue about the odd position in which 
AMD has placed its latest 7 series 
chips: HEDT performance, with a 
mainstream chipset. And that‚Äôs 
what‚Äôs giving me pause for thought. 
Connectivity support isn‚Äôt enough 
for what I have in mind on the X370 
platform. Couple that with Intel‚Äôs 
better thermals, impressive arsenal of 
motherboards, and more adventurous 
overclocking experience, and, well, 
that choice starts to dwindle once 
more. So, Intel Core i7-6900K and 
Rampage V, here I come, I guess!

BACKGROUND
Nintendo has Ô¨Ånally launched its new console, the Switch. But 
forget playing games for now‚Äîit‚Äôs time to take a peek at the 
hardware. Come tear down with us!
MAJOR TECH SPECS
‚Ä¢ Nvidia customized Tegra processor
‚Ä¢  Built-in 6.2-inch 1280x720 multi-touch LCD screen (capable 
of 1920x1080 on external display via HDMI)
‚Ä¢  32GB of internal storage (up to 2TB additional storage via 
microSDHC or microSDXC card)
‚Ä¢  802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB Type-C charge 
port, and 3.5mm audio jack on the console, plus three 
standard USB ports on the Switch Dock
‚Ä¢  Stereo speakers
‚Ä¢  Rechargeable Li-ion battery capable of 2.5‚Äì6.5 hours‚Äô play
‚Ä¢  Detachable wireless Joy-Cons
KEY FINDINGS
‚Ä¢ Disappointingly, tri-point screws guard the entrance, but we 
only have to Ô¨Çex a tiny bit of muscle. Tri-points are Nintendo‚Äôs 
version of a ‚ÄúKeep out‚Äù sign, but once past them, the back 
cover lifts off easily. Our Ô¨Årst peek inside reveals little. Just a 
metal shield. However, once uncased, the modular microSD 
card board is replaceable. Good news for future storage!
‚Ä¢  The heatpipe is secured by Phillips screws, so thermal paste 
reapplication should be a breeze. We aim for the fan, but it 
looks like you can only clean it from here‚Äîit‚Äôs trapped under 
the I/O board. So we pop out the game card reader and 
attached headphone jack.
‚Ä¢  The speakers are lightly adhered to the rear case, but don‚Äôt 
put up much of a Ô¨Åght. The larger diaphragms will displace 
more air, and a ported back allows for booming bass, but 
reports say they still ‚Äúfavor treble.‚Äù Phillips screws secure a 
Joy-Con rail to either end of the console. Each has a set of pin 
contacts that interlock with contacts on the Joy-Cons to pass 
charge and button presses to the mobo via ribbon cable.
‚Ä¢  And for the cherry on this sundae? The LCD display is easily 
removable! Increasing a device‚Äôs portability usually means 
increasing its likelihood of getting dropped. So way to go, 
Nintendo, for making a more breakable device more Ô¨Åxable. 
‚Ä¢  Repairability Score: 8 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). Aside 
from the digitizer, screws are used instead of adhesive. Most 
components, including the analog sticks, game cartridge 
reader, and headphone jack, are modular and can be 
replaced. Batteries, while adhered to their housing, are 
modular and can also be replaced. The digitizer and display 
are not fused, reducing the cost of repair, but increasing 
complexity. Proprietary tri-point screws restrict users from 
opening the Switch. Replacing a display or digitizer requires 
heating and prying against strong adhesive.

Secure Your Network
With IPFire

GATHER MATERIALS
What exactly are we doing here? We‚Äôre building a network 
appliance, which is a piece of hardware that sits on your 
network and performs speciÔ¨Åc tasks; your existing router, for 
example, could be considered a network appliance. An IPFire box 
doesn‚Äôt have just one job, though. It‚Äôs a Ô¨Årewall Ô¨Årst and foremost, 
but we can make it do much more, such as managing DNS and DHCP 
for our network. To put it in place, you need to have a dedicated PC, 
cabled between your Internet connection and the rest of the devices 
on your network. You don‚Äôt need a mouse or keyboard once it‚Äôs all 
sorted, but in order to hook it all up you need at least two Ethernet 
cables, a machine with two Ethernet ports, and the appropriate 
version of the IPFire distribution from www.ipÔ¨Åre.org. Make sure 
you expand the download options [Image A] on the site, as we‚Äôre 
going to suggest you install this on a USB stick (so grab the disk 
image version rather than the ISO installer), and if you‚Äôre running 
on older hardware (we‚Äôre Ô¨Åring ours up on a 10-year-old Intel Atom 
netbook), you may need the 586 or ARM versions, rather than the X64 
ALL TOO OFTEN, we take our network security for granted. But leaving the integrity of your Internet 
connection to your router is tantamount to madness. That‚Äôs a device most likely selected by your 
ISP, a company probably not noted for its scruples, to hit the lowest possible price point. It‚Äôs mass-
market hardware, probably not updated in eons, with the associated vulnerabilities and bugs of 
a machine that‚Äôs been hammered to death by all the port scans and hacker malice in the world. 
The good news is that installing a pro-level network appliance on your network is not even slightly 
difÔ¨Åcult; Linux distro IPFire can perform the task very well, as long as you have the requisite 
hardware. It‚Äôs not looking for much in terms of specs‚Äîan original Pentium will sufÔ¨Åce‚Äîbut you 
need at least two Ethernet ports. A cheap USB Ethernet dongle should work as an extra port, or at 
least it did for us. ‚ÄìALEX COX

that‚Äôs offered up by default. Note that a properly conÔ¨Ågured 
pair of VirtualBox virtual machines is adequate for testing 
IPFire if you don‚Äôt yet have the requisite hardware; we‚Äôll 
leave that particular conÔ¨Åguration as a task for you‚Ä¶.

GET INSTALLED
Installing IPFire is easier than it might look. Extract 
the gzipped .img.gz Ô¨Åle using something like 7-zip 
or WinRAR, then write the resulting .img Ô¨Åle to a USB drive 
or SD card using Win32DiskImager (https://sourceforge.
net/projects/win32diskimager), ensuring you write to 
the correct removable device. It‚Äôs not a tremendously 
difÔ¨Åcult process, and since IPFire generally runs itself 
from a RAMdisk, there‚Äôs no need to worry about heavy 
writes being made to solid-state media. Nonetheless, if 
you‚Äôd rather install IPFire directly, you can do so using the 
ISO image instead. Boot from whatever media IPFire is 
installed on, and we can begin initial conÔ¨Åguration. Select

your keyboard, select your timezone, and either give the machine a 
hostname or stick with the default. You also have to supply a domain 
name; if you‚Äôre already running a domain on your network, make 
sure you input the same name here‚Äîrunning IPFire on a separate 
domain wouldn‚Äôt make an awful lot of sense. Now input a root 
password (and make it a good one, because IPFire is supposed to 
be your main line of defense), and add a password for the admin 
user, which has rights to use its web interface, too. 
3
NETWORK SETUP
ConÔ¨Åguring IPFire‚Äôs initial network options [Image B] is, 
frankly, a little intimidating, but there‚Äôs no need to worry. 
Pick ‚ÄúGreen + Red‚Äù under the ‚ÄúNetwork conÔ¨Åguration type‚Äù menu 
(see ‚ÄúZoning restrictions‚Äù on the right to Ô¨Ånd out what the different 
colors mean), and use the ‚ÄúDrivers and card assignments‚Äù menu 
to assign one of your Ethernet ports to the red Internet zone, and 
the other to your green zone, the home of your local network. 
If you have an identical pair of cards, just choose either one, and 
be prepared to swap cables between ports if IPFire appears not 
to work. Head over to the ‚ÄúAddress settings‚Äù menu, and give the 
Ethernet adapter connected to your green zone an IP from the local 
range‚Äîwe‚Äôd go for something along the lines of 192.168.1.1, but the 
likes of 10.x.x.x and 172.16.x.x are similarly valid. This address is 
where you‚Äôll later access IPFire‚Äôs web interface, so make a note of 
it. For your red interface, we‚Äôre going to presume you‚Äôre using a 
C
B
broadband connection with a modem that doesn‚Äôt require 
any special credentials for access. In this case, just select 
‚ÄúDHCP‚Äù [Image C], and IPFire takes care of the rest. Lastly, 
it‚Äôs time to conÔ¨Ågure ‚ÄúDNS and gateway settings.‚Äù Inserting 
a public DNS server here is optional, but could mean an 
extra layer of integrity for your connection, and the DHCP 
server determines which addresses are made available to 
devices on your network. Make sure your IPFire box is set 
as the primary DNS, and that everything is running on the 
same subnet.
4
HARD FACTS
We‚Äôre ready to go, right? Not quite. Make sure, if 
you‚Äôre attaching IPFire to a combined modem-
router, that it‚Äôs running in router-only mode, because 
having wireless access before your IPFire installation 
completely bypasses it, and defeats the object somewhat. 
Similarly, disable DHCP on any wireless routers you 
may be inserting into the green zone (we want IPFire to 
dole out the addresses). And here‚Äôs a trick that we didn‚Äôt 
learn until banging our heads against it for some hours: 
Don‚Äôt plug your green zone port into the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù port 
of your wireless router. Plug it into one of the other ports 
ZONING RESTRICTIONS
RED
Everything outside of IPFire‚Äôs control is placed in the 
red zone. Basically, this is its input, probably coming 
directly from the Internet. Every IPFire setup includes a red 
zone; if it didn‚Äôt, there would be no point in using IPFire at all.
GREEN
Your wired network is designated in the green zone. 
This area is for devices that fall under IPFire‚Äôs direct 
protection, meaning they‚Äôre subject to your Ô¨Årewall rules and 
other restrictions. It should, in theory, be a safe network.
ORANGE
An optional DMZ, or demilitarized zone. If you have 
servers you want to be web-accessible and excluded 
from certain network rules, put them in the orange zone.
BLUE
Wireless devices go here‚Äîbut bear in mind that you 
need to use special wireless hardware, and explicitly 
allow any device that connects to the blue zone. It may be better, 
for home users, to fudge it on green.

D
instead. The router might complain about not being able to connect 
to the Internet but, in our experience, if it‚Äôs only being used to 
generate wireless connections, that doesn‚Äôt matter in the slightest.
5
FRONT END
All being well, IPFire should now be up and running. Give 
everything a reboot (modem, IPFire box, and any network 
hardware on the other end) just to make sure, then head over 
to IPFire‚Äôs web interface, which you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd either (by default) at 
https://ipÔ¨Åre.localdomain:444 or, substituting the IP address for 
the one you gave it earlier, at https://192.168.1.1:444. Log in with 
the username ‚Äúadmin‚Äù and the password you set earlier, and you 
can start poking around. Take your Ô¨Årst look at the ‚ÄúDHCP server‚Äù 
page, in the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù section, to check that IPFire is serving up 
those internal IP addresses successfully‚Äîif everything‚Äôs working, 
you should see a table of IPs at the bottom of the page. By default, 
at least if you didn‚Äôt change the value during installation, each of 
these addresses is leased for a short amount of time; hitting the 
‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button next to a trusted device assigns it that IP address on a 
Ô¨Åxed basis [Image D]. Knowing exactly where something is can be 
particularly useful when it comes to troubleshooting your network 
later on, so it‚Äôs worth doing. Now, using the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù pencil, you can 
also change the device‚Äôs label, if it‚Äôs not quite obvious enough.
6
BLOCKING OUT
IPFire‚Äôs place between your Internet connection and your 
network means it can do some pretty useful things. One 
of these is web Ô¨Åltering, enabling you to shield tiny eyes from the 
true horrors of the web. But before you can set that up, you need to 
enable IPFire‚Äôs proxy (‚ÄúNetwork > Web Proxy‚Äù), which is its method 
of trafÔ¨Åc interception. Check the boxes for both ‚ÄúEnable‚Äù and 
‚ÄúTransparent‚Äù on your green network, then check the ‚ÄúURL Ô¨Ålter‚Äù 
option on the row below, before scrolling down, and clicking ‚ÄúSave 
and Restart.‚Äù Once the page has refreshed, head over to ‚ÄúNetwork 
> URL Filter.‚Äù In its most simple form, you can use the Ô¨Ålter to 
block speciÔ¨Åc domains and addresses, by inputting them in the 
custom blacklist boxes, and checking the box below. Alternatively, 
if you really want to lock down the majority of your network, a 
whitelist of allowed sites might be more your style. If you 
earlier gave your main machine a Ô¨Åxed IP address, we 
recommend adding it to the ‚ÄúUnÔ¨Åltered‚Äù section lower 
down, so at least one machine on the network maintains 
full Internet access. There‚Äôs a further option, too: grabbing 
a vast list of spurious sites from a pre-built blacklist. You 
can do this automatically through IPFire‚Äôs interface (see 
the ‚ÄúAutomatic Blacklist Update‚Äù section), but we don‚Äôt 
recommend it unless you‚Äôre running on some muscular 
hardware‚Äîchecking every little thing against a massive 
database can make web surÔ¨Ång miserably slow.
7
FIREFIGHTING
Of course, IPFire‚Äôs key feature is in its name: its 
detailed, hardcore Ô¨Årewall. Once you‚Äôve had it up and 
running for a while, head over to ‚ÄúLogs > Firewall Logs‚Äù to 
see the kind of thing it‚Äôs catching in its default state. You‚Äôll 
probably see a lot of ‚ÄúDROP_INPUT‚Äù entries, which are

Being a Linux distro‚Äîalbeit a unique one, given that IPFire 
isn‚Äôt necessarily built on top of the likes of Debian, Red Hat, 
et al‚Äîyou can gain access to IPFire‚Äôs command-line interface 
from any machine on your network, once you‚Äôve switched it on 
via ‚ÄúSystem > SSH access.‚Äù Windows doesn‚Äôt naturally support 
SSH, so you need a tool that‚Äôs happy to connect to it (PuTTY, from 
www.putty.org, is ideal), and IPFire uses a non-standard port 
for security reasons, so note that you have to connect to port 222 
rather than 22.
Once you‚Äôre connected, you can do all sorts of handy 
network things. Try pinging devices on your network by typing 
 ping <ip address>  or testing your Internet connection 
by pinging a web address. Take it further, and use the 
 traceroute  command to see the entire path to a device. Look 
at what‚Äôs running on your IPFire box, and exactly what sort of 
resources it‚Äôs taking up, by installing htop from the ‚ÄúIPFire > 
Pakfire‚Äù menu, then running  htop  from within the command 
line. Heck, you could even set up user IDs for everyone in 
your home, and give them all a Linux shell to play with. It‚Äôs 
up to you.
COMMAND & CONTROL
rogue packets that IPFire has successfully deÔ¨Çected, and maybe 
a few ‚ÄúDROP_NEWNOTSYN‚Äù entries on internal devices, which 
are unavoidable artefacts of a slightly shoddy network stack on at 
least one of your machines, but absolutely nothing to worry about. 
If you‚Äôre interested in the source of any external hits, particularly 
if something is hammering your network a lot, there are Ô¨Çags to 
indicate the country of origin, and you can click on any address to do 
a quick Whois request to Ô¨Ånd out its owner. Slightly more readable, 
though less detailed, statistics on the Ô¨Årewall‚Äôs baddie-thwarting 
efforts can be found beneath ‚ÄúLogs > FW-Loggraphs‚Äù [Image E].
8
HARD RULES
The Ô¨Årewall can be given rules to direct trafÔ¨Åc more 
appropriately, too. Head to ‚ÄúFirewall > Firewall Rules‚Äù 
to see the list, which, by default, is empty; this doesn‚Äôt mean the 
Ô¨Årewall isn‚Äôt doing anything, just that you haven‚Äôt yet put any 
exceptions in place. You can go into a huge amount of detail with 
this, but let‚Äôs create a quick example rule to designate one of the 
machines on our network as a web server. Click ‚ÄúNew rule.‚Äù In the 
‚ÄúSource‚Äù section, click the ‚ÄúStandard networks‚Äù radio button, and 
leave ‚ÄúAny‚Äù selected in its drop-down box. Check ‚ÄúUse Network 
Address Translation,‚Äù then write the address of your server 
machine in the box below. Under ‚ÄúProtocol,‚Äù select ‚ÄúTCP,‚Äù then set 
the destination port to 80, the standard port for web trafÔ¨Åc. Pop a 
note on your rule in the ‚ÄúRemark‚Äù box, click ‚ÄúAdd,‚Äù and now any web 
trafÔ¨Åc that hits your WAN address goes to your selected machine.
>> If you‚Äôre well endowed with system resources (you need at 
least 2GB of RAM, and a strong CPU), you can also run an intrusion 
detection system to analyze packets on your network, and keep 
you informed of potential attacks. Head to ‚ÄúServices > Intrusion 
Detection‚Äù to switch it on. IPFire uses Snort (www.snort.org) which, 
while it offers a commercial tier for the most up-to-date rules, is 
completely free to apply to your network.
9
MAKING ADDITIONS
IPFire‚Äôs core functionality is pretty comprehensive. Aside 
from everything we‚Äôve covered, there‚Äôs a function to cache 
Windows updates, so that all machines on your network can get 
them from your central server, rather than redownloading them 
(‚ÄúNetwork > Update Accelerator‚Äù), a service that manages NTP 
time servers over your network (‚ÄúServices > Time Servers‚Äù), 
timed access restrictions (‚ÄúNetwork > Connection Scheduler‚Äù), 
and built-in VPN facilities (‚ÄúServices > OpenVPN‚Äù), to name but a 
few. These aren‚Äôt the limit of what it can do, though. You can install 
new applications using PakÔ¨Åre (‚ÄúIPFire > PakÔ¨Åre‚Äù), which includes 
a long list of stuff, from console apps, such as htop‚Äî see 
‚ÄúCommand & control‚Äù above for more on IPFire‚Äôs command 
line‚Äîto full-blown add-ons to IPFire‚Äôs capabilities. Most 
interestingly to us, you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd the package tor-x.x.x, which 
allows us to take advantage of The Onion Router, to add 
privacy to our network, and even offer it up as a relay, so it 
can be a routing node or even exit point for other people‚Äôs 
trafÔ¨Åc. Click it to highlight it, click the blue plus button, 
then conÔ¨Årm you‚Äôd like to install the packages.
10
TOR UP
Once installed, you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd a new conÔ¨Åguration 
page for Tor at ‚ÄúIPFire > Tor‚Äù [Image F]. Check 
the appropriate box to enable the Tor server, optionally 
select the location of your preferred exit node, then click the 
‚ÄúSave‚Äù button at the bottom of the page. You can now direct 
web browsers on your network to use the SOCKS server, 
on port 9050 of your IPFire box, for pretty-private Internet 
access. To do this with Chrome, for example, make yourself 
a new Chrome shortcut, and add the Ô¨Çags  --proxy-server
=‚Äùsocks5://192.168.1.1:9050‚Äù --host-resolver-rules=‚ÄùMAP

Create Your Own
Logo Wallpaper

LOCATE A LOGO
First, catch your logo. We were lucky enough to score a Ryzen 
logo as a vector EPS Ô¨Åle, which meant we could rasterize it in 
Photoshop to whatever size we wanted. So we made it 50 x 30cm 
at 300dpi‚Äîa preposterously large size for something that‚Äôs going 
to be displayed on a 1440p screen, or a 4K one at a push. The logo 
touched the edges of the canvas, so we used ‚ÄúImage > Canvas Size‚Äù 
to expand it to 70 x 50cm at 300dpi‚Äîover 8,200 pixels across. The 
logo is Ô¨Çoating freely on its own layer, so we don‚Äôt need to extract 
it‚Äîyou‚Äôll want to do this if your logo is a .jpg or .png Ô¨Åle, in order to 
Ô¨Åll in behind it. Cut around the logo with one of the marquee tools, 
or use one of the quick selection tools, then use ‚ÄúLayer > New > 
Layer Via Copy‚Äù to extract it.
2
ADD SOME LIGHT
We‚Äôre seeing AMD in a new light since the launch of Ryzen, 
so let‚Äôs cast some new light on the logo [groan!‚ÄîEd.]. 
Photoshop‚Äôs Lighting Effects Ô¨Ålter was completely rebuilt for the 
CS6 release in 2012, so it‚Äôs one of the newer Ô¨Ålters in the application‚Äôs 
armory. Lighting Effects enables you to place a directional light on 
your image, lightening and darkening it to reÔ¨Çect the beam. Select 
the layer with your logo on it, then head to ‚ÄúFilter > Render > 
Lighting Effects‚Äù to open the Ô¨Ålter window [Image A]. Mess about 
with it until you get something pleasing. We‚Äôve got a spotlight 
coming in from the right, with its beam constrained so it lights up 
the left side of the logo‚Äôs swirl.

MAKE IT STAND OUT
The black background behind the logo is just a 
simple layer Ô¨Ålled with black using the Bucket tool‚Äî
nothing complicated there. Against the black, however, the 
lettering of the Ryzen logo disappears somewhat, so we‚Äôre 
going to use the Magic Wand to select the text, and copy it 
to a new layer, as detailed earlier. Hide the black layer by 
removing the eye icon next to it in the Layers palette, to 
make things easier if you‚Äôve got a similar black-on-black 
scenario. To make the lettering stand out, we‚Äôre going to 
use some Layer Styles. Double-click the layer to bring up

YOUR WALLPAPER, OR SCREEN BACKGROUND, is a very personal thing. It‚Äôs easy enough to place just 
about any image you want on your desktop with a click of the right mouse button, but you almost 
immediately get into problems with aspect ratios and resolution‚Äîan image that‚Äôs too small looks 
terrible when stretched across your monitor.
So, why not make your own? There are lots of reasons why you should, from a cell phone shot 
being easily high enough resolution and likely the right aspect ratio, to the availability of the stunning 
photography Microsoft provides in its background packs (we like ReÔ¨Çections and Aurora Borealis). 
An image that is exactly the pixel dimensions of your monitor is always going to look sharper than 
one that‚Äôs had to be altered in some way, and that‚Äôs what a bespoke wallpaper offers.
If you do decide to make your own, why not brand your PC with some component logos? A lot of 
our PCs are bespoke designs themselves, after all. In anticipation of an AMD-powered monster 
emerging from Zak‚Äôs smoking lab, we did exactly that. ‚ÄìIAN EVENDEN

to get the effect we have [Image B]. Or play around with what looks 
good on your image.

ADJUST THE ANGLE
We merged the lettering back into the logo layer by selecting 
the two layers in the Layers palette and using ‚ÄúLayer > 
Merge Layers.‚Äù Keeping this newly created layer selected, we 
headed to the terrifying ‚Äú3D‚Äù menu, and created a postcard using 
‚Äú3D > New Mesh From Layer > Postcard.‚Äù A postcard is the 
simplest 3D mesh Photoshop can produce‚Äîit‚Äôs nothing more than 
a Ô¨Çat plane, which can have 3D properties attached to it. We‚Äôre not 
going to do anything too involved here, just adjust the angle at which 
the logo sits relative to the viewer, so that‚Äôs the perfect kind of layer 
for our needs. Photoshop asks whether you want to change to the 
3D workspace from whatever you‚Äôre currently using‚Äîit‚Äôs worth 
doing so, just to get a feel for what it‚Äôs like, but remember to change 
back once you‚Äôve Ô¨Ånished using the ‚ÄúWindows, Workspace‚Äù drop-
down at the top-right of the interface.
5
USE THE 3D WORKSPACE
If you‚Äôre not used to 3D applications, Photoshop‚Äôs 3D 
workspace can be a little daunting. You have the three axes 
around which to move your layer, shown by the small cube with 
three arrows coming off it in the center, and your cursor changes 
D
as it moves across the screen, because it does different 
things depending on where it‚Äôs placed. One moment it may 
be rotating your layer, while a move to the left can change 
it to one that moves it. The lighting you set up earlier is 
baked into the layer, and doesn‚Äôt change as you rotate it 
around. We simply push the logo around its X axis, so it 
appears to lean back, then move it back into the center of 
the composition. A Z-axis rotation puts it at a jaunty angle 
[Image C], and a right-click on the Layer 3 Mesh in the 2D 
palette brings up a menu from which we select ‚ÄúRasterize 
3D Layer.‚Äù And the 3D experiment is over.
6
FINISHING TOUCHES 
Back in familiar 2D Photoshop, we tell the Crop tool 
to trim our image to the precise pixel dimensions by 
inputting them in the Ô¨Åelds at the top-left of the interface  
[Image D]. Drag a box on your composition, and you‚Äôll 
see that it‚Äôs locked to the correct aspect ratio. Click the 
checkmark once you‚Äôre happy, and your image is cropped 
and resized to whatever dimensions you entered. We also 
decided to spruce up the background a touch with a free 
texture from http://deviantart.com, layered over the black 
layer, with a low opacity, and also added a slight gradient 
to the black layer, to give our Ô¨Ånal image just a touch more 
pop [Image E]. 
E
The Crop tool is one of the most useful aspects of Photoshop if 
you‚Äôre processing a lot of images quickly by hand‚Äîfor instance, 
if you‚Äôre preparing them for upload to a website‚Äôs CMS, and they 
all need to be the same size. By saving presets, you can jump to 
exactly the pixel dimensions you need, and you can rotate the 
crop box, too, to make up for any slight variations in level. It‚Äôs also 
marked with lines showing the rule of thirds, so you can quickly 
crop to a more pleasing composition. For more speed, you don‚Äôt 
even need to click the checkmark icon‚Äîa simple double-click 
within the area of the crop box applies it.

Turn Your Home PC
into a VPN Server
1
PREPARE THE SERVER
This guide requires two PCs: one (a desktop or laptop) to act as 
the server, and a laptop, which will be the client you‚Äôre carrying 
on the road. The server PC must be powered on at all times‚Äî
something to bear in mind if you‚Äôre traveling for several days.
>> Using the server PC, download LogMeIn Hamachi from www.
vpn.net, and run the software installer. When the program starts 
for the Ô¨Årst time, click the power button to activate it, and you‚Äôre 
prompted to create a user account, which is used to manage all 
your virtual networks and their users [Image A]. Do so, then verify it 
using the link that‚Äôs emailed to you and re-entering your password. 
Click ‚ÄúCreate a new network,‚Äù and enter a name and password. The 
name can be anything you like‚ÄîHamachi identiÔ¨Åes you using your 
account and device ID, so this is just for your reference.
2
START SETTING UP THE CLIENT
Now install Hamachi on your laptop, and log in using your 
account details. You‚Äôre sent an email notiÔ¨Åcation each time 
you log in from a new device as a security measure, but you don‚Äôt 
need to authorize the connection. Select ‚ÄúJoin an existing network,‚Äù 
enter the network name and password you created earlier, and 
click ‚ÄúJoin.‚Äù The name of your desktop PC appears. Right-click 
IF YOU TRAVEL FREQUENTLY‚Äîfor work or fun‚Äîyou‚Äôve probably found yourself in a hotel room or a 
caf√© with a Wi-Fi password scribbled on a sheet of notepaper and no idea how secure the connection 
is. Sometimes, you might be able to tether your laptop to your phone, but most plans don‚Äôt let you 
make wireless hotspots unless you pay an extra fee, and it‚Äôs very easy to chew through a whole 
month‚Äôs data allowance as Windows decides it‚Äôs a good time to perform some critical updates.
You can get around this problem by using a PC at home as a proxy server. Rather than data 
traveling directly from your laptop to the web server, it‚Äôs sent via a secure encrypted connection to 
your home PC, which then forwards it.
This technique is only for avoiding eavesdropping on potentially unsecured public networks‚Äîit 
won‚Äôt hide anything from your ISP. It‚Äôs also worth noting that your Internet connection speed will 
be slower than it would be at home‚Äîparticularly if you‚Äôre a long way from home when you log on.
We‚Äôre using a free VPN tool called Hamachi, which is mainly used by gamers to create virtual 
local networks, and non-caching web proxy Privoxy. Here‚Äôs how to set it up. ‚ÄìCATHERINE EMMA ELLIS

account login details, and you‚Äôll see that you can access 
the desktop PC‚Äôs Ô¨Ålesystem [Image B].
>> If you have trouble connecting to the network, you 
might need to take a look at Windows‚Äô Ô¨Årewall settings, and 
make an exception for Hamachi. Right-clicking the client 
PC‚Äôs name in Hamachi gives you the option of diagnosing 
network problems, but it doesn‚Äôt offer any guidance.

CONFIGURE PRIVOXY
Now return to your client PC and download Privoxy 
from www.silvester.org.uk/privoxy/Windows‚Äîthe 
latest stable version of the Windows installer is privoxy_
setup_3_0_23.exe. Run the installer, then close the 
empty window that appears. Privoxy doesn‚Äôt have a GUI 
like Hamachi, so right-click the new Privoxy icon in your 
system tray, and select ‚ÄúEdit > Main conÔ¨Åguration‚Äù to 
open the main settings Ô¨Åle [Image C].
>> Scroll down the text document to section 4.1, and Ô¨Ånd 
the line  listen-address 127.0.0.1:8118 . Type a  #  in front of 
this line to mark it as a comment, then underneath it type:
listen-address [the IP address at the top of your 
Hamachi window]:8118
>> Save and close the Ô¨Åle. Restart Privoxy. The Windows 
Ô¨Årewall might prompt you to allow or deny the connection.

SET UP YOUR BROWSER
Now you just need to conÔ¨Ågure your laptop browser‚Äôs proxy 
settings to redirect network trafÔ¨Åc via Hamachi. In our 
example, we‚Äôre using Firefox‚Äîopen the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù menu, then 
select ‚ÄúAdvanced,‚Äù click ‚ÄúConnection settings,‚Äù scroll down to the 
section on proxies, and use the network address that you entered 
in the Privoxy conÔ¨Åguration Ô¨Åle, along with the port number 
8118 [Image D].
>> The process is very similar for most web browsers, though 
Edge and Internet Explorer use Windows‚Äô own networking settings, 
so all network trafÔ¨Åc is routed through the proxy‚Äînot just browsing 
trafÔ¨Åc. You might prefer to limit it to your browser, to avoid system 
updates being downloaded over a slow connection. Browser 
extensions such as Foxy Proxy (https://addons.mozilla.org/nn-no/
C
Ô¨Årefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) make it easy to switch 
between proxies, and are also worth considering for their 
added convenience.
>> Once it‚Äôs conÔ¨Ågured, visit www.privoxy.org/conÔ¨Åg, 
and you should see a message informing you that Privoxy 
is enabled. If so, congratulations‚Äîyou can now take your 
laptop away, and connect to the Internet securely via your 
server PC. If you don‚Äôt see such a message, the issue is 
likely to be your Ô¨Årewall settings, or a conÔ¨Çict with an 
existing proxy that you‚Äôve forgotten to deactivate.
5
PRIVOXY SECURITY OPTIONS
Privoxy‚Äôs default settings are Ô¨Åne for getting a 
secure connection up and running quickly, but the 
software is also highly customizable. Right-click its icon in 
the notiÔ¨Åcation panel on your server PC, and select ‚ÄúEdit > 
User Actions‚Äù to tailor its options to suit your Internet use. 
For example, Privoxy doesn‚Äôt cache cookies by default, but 
you can choose to override this for certain sites you visit 
frequently to avoid having to log in each time. You can also 
choose whether to exempt some sites from Privoxy‚Äôs built-
in ad-blocking, and Ô¨Ålter out annoying page elements. The 
comments in the Ô¨Åle are quite self-explanatory, and you 
can Ô¨Ånd detailed instructions at www.privoxy.org/user-
manual/actions-Ô¨Åle.html.
>> To be safe, it‚Äôs a good idea to make a backup of any 
conÔ¨Åguration Ô¨Åles before you change them, so you can 
easily restore them if any of your changes prevent Privoxy 
from loading, or stop certain pages working, and you‚Äôre not 
sure how to reverse the change. 
D
Setting up your own proxy server isn‚Äôt the 
only way to secure your browsing when 
you‚Äôre away from home. Another option 
is to use a VPN service, which does the 
hard work of encrypting the data and 
redirecting it for you. You can usually 
choose from a list of servers in locations 
around the world, which makes it a good 
way to avoid region-blocking.
There are some free VPNs around, but 
all of them have strict data transfer caps 
that make them impractical for anything 
more than checking a few emails; 100-
500MB per day is the standard offering. 
If you travel frequently, it‚Äôs worth 
considering a premium VPN service such 
as Hotspot Shield Elite, AnchorFree, or 
TorGuard. This is the only viable option 
if you want to download large Ô¨Åles or 
stream video over a secure connection, 
but it‚Äôs wise to research your options 
carefully beforehand‚Äîsome VPNs log 
more of their users‚Äô activity than others, 
and for different periods of time.
Another option is Tor Browser, which 
re-routes browser trafÔ¨Åc through a 
network of nodes around the world‚Äö not 
just one server. Its main disadvantage is 
its slower speed. The data is decrypted at 
the last node, so there‚Äôs a small chance 
that it could be intercepted at this point, 
but it‚Äôs otherwise one of the best ways to 
keep your browsing private and secure.

Ryzen on a
Budget
Reasonable B
IT‚ÄôS NOT OFTEN we get to build 
a machine around a brand new 
architecture. With the release of 
AMD‚Äôs Ryzen 7 chips, though, that‚Äôs 
exactly what we‚Äôve done. In fact, 
we‚Äôve done it twice. Turn to page 26, 
and you‚Äôll discover how to build a no-
compromise monster, with the top-end 
Ryzen at its heart. The problem is, that 
machine rolls in at over $5,000, which 
puts it out of range of lots of potential 
system builders. To be fair, there are 
some liberties with that machine on 
the storage and memory front, but 
even so, what if your pockets are not 
quite so deep? Can you build a decent 
Ryzen PC for considerably less?
Of course you can, which is why 
we‚Äôve dedicated this month‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild It‚Äù 
to the humble task of seeing what you 
can do with the most affordable Ryzen 
chip, the AMD Ryzen 7 1700. This is a 
mainstream machine that doesn‚Äôt need 
a do-anything storage subsystem, 
or a graphics card that costs more 
than some entry-level systems. It‚Äôs a 
machine that can handle rendering, 
video editing, and image manipulation, 
and even turn its hand to a bit of 
gaming. The kind of system that none of 
us would be embarrassed to own, even 
if we might want something with a little 
more oomph as our main machine.  
THE CONCEPT
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: EASY 
An affordable counterpoint to this month‚Äôs feature build, 
we put the Ryzen value proposition to work

71

MAXIMUMPC
BUILDING ON A SOLID CORE 
THE RYZEN 7 1700 may sit at the bottom of the current Ryzen 
stack, but it still boasts eight physical cores, and is capable of 
handling 16 threads at once‚Äîit‚Äôs still designed with heavy lifting 
in mind. That makes it a Ô¨Åne bedfellow for high-end parts, but 
what if your needs are less demanding? Or your bank balance 
less gregarious? That‚Äôs where this month‚Äôs build comes in. We 
wanted a machine that would deliver where it counts, but wouldn‚Äôt 
cost the earth, so we‚Äôve chosen components that offer good value 
for money, while still helping with overall performance.
 One of the Ô¨Årst choices is on the motherboard front. At the 
time of writing, we haven‚Äôt seen enough AM4 boards to have any 
deÔ¨Ånitive answers, but you know where you are with Asus, and 
the Prime X370-PRO has plenty of features on offer. Likewise, 
the memory landscape isn‚Äôt fully formed yet, which means we 
don‚Äôt quite know the best kits to recommend right now, so we‚Äôve 
picked a kit that has served us well previously. 
Given that we want this machine to be an all-rounder, we‚Äôve 
opted for an Asus ROG Strix RX 480 to provide the graphical grunt. 
It‚Äôs a great card for 1080p gaming, with smooth frame rates in 
all the latest games. The fact it boasts 8GB of onboard memory 
means you should have room for games going forward as well.
Note that, after feedback, we now include the cost of the OS in 
our builds, although you‚Äôre free to choose whatever OS you want.
AIR COOLERS TEND to be easier to install than their 
water-based brethren, because there isn‚Äôt a radiator on 
rubber tubes to wrestle with. You do need to watch your 
Ô¨Ångers on the Ô¨Åns, though, as they have a tendency to 
shred your Ô¨Ångers in the tight conÔ¨Ånes of a case‚Äîso we 
recommend installing air coolers outside of the case. 
AMD‚Äôs new chips use the AM4 socket, which boasts a 
similar mounting bracket to the previous generation‚Äîa 
bar stretches across the bottom of the cooler, which you 
lock into place using lugs on the brackets. Throwing the 
locking bar over gives you a secure cooler that‚Äôs easy to 
release when you need to. The Be Quiet! Pure Rock even 
comes with a thin layer of thermal paste in place on the 
underside. Connect the fan, and you‚Äôre good to go.
THE ANTEC P9 is a spacious case to work in, with lots 
of room for routing cables. This means you don‚Äôt have 
to install the power supply before everything else. We 
reached for the motherboard Ô¨Årst, noting that the case 
didn‚Äôt have all the mounting stand-offs installed by 
default‚Äîthey‚Äôre in a small box, with more cable ties, 
paper washers, plenty of screws, speaker, and more 
cables. These are easy to screw in place, and as this is 
a full-sized mobo, we recommend installing them all. 
Don‚Äôt forget to install the ATX backplate before securing 
the mobo, though, otherwise you‚Äôll have to unscrew 
everything again. Installing memory before sliding the 
mobo into place is good idea, but you should just have 
room to add/remove sticks if you have nimble Ô¨Ångers.

THE CORSAIR CX500 is always a great option if you‚Äôre trying to 
build on a tight budget, because it‚Äôs a quality brand, and has 
plenty of power for modest builds, but still manages to roll 
in at a frankly ridiculous $41. It isn‚Äôt modular, which is hardly 
surprising at this price point, so you‚Äôll have to be creative with 
your cable management to keep things tidy. We installed the 
power supply with the fan pointing downward here, and had 
no problem securing it in place after applying a little pressure 
on top of the PSU to counter the P9‚Äôs sponge strips on the PSU 
bracket, which are designed to help stop vibrations. 
ALL THE WAY through this build, we routed as many cables 
behind the motherboard tray as humanly possible, because 
this helps with airÔ¨Çow and also keeps the machine looking 
tidy. It helps that the P9 has plenty of holes to make this a 
possibility, and there‚Äôs a central column of cables that you 
can easily add to as you go. Having said that, there isn‚Äôt that 
much room back there, and having a solid central bank of 
cables isn‚Äôt possible‚Äîwell, that‚Äôs the excuse we‚Äôre using 
for this not being quite as tidy as we initially hoped for. We 
could have used a few more cable ties on the power cables, 
but ultimately it‚Äôs a tidy enough build, given we were still 
trying out different conÔ¨Ågurations right to the end.

THERE ARE SOME great deals to be had on RX 480s at the 
moment, and the Asus ROG Strix RX 480 8GB is a good 
example of what‚Äôs out there. This triple-fan card boasts 
higher clocks than the reference cards, but isn‚Äôt noisy under 
pressure, which is a boon. Its length can be a problem, 
though, and indeed wouldn‚Äôt quite Ô¨Åt inside the Antec P9 
until we removed the middle drive bay‚Äîa ridiculously easy 
task that simply requires the releasing of one screw. Once 
removed, the card eases into place no problem, then it‚Äôs 
simply a case of connecting the power cable. 
THERE ARE PLENTY of options for your drives in the Antec P9, 
but the best place to install your SSDs is in the back of the case, 
in a caddy that can hold two standard SSDs. A pair of screws 
hold this caddy in place, which makes installation much easier 
than trying to screw the drives in place with it in situ. The case 
comes with plenty of screws, so securing our boot drive with 
four screws makes sense. It‚Äôs worth noting that as space is a 
little tight back here, you can‚Äôt use angled SATA cables, because 
they come out further than the chassis allows at this orientation. 
We installed the data drive in the bottom block of cages at the 
front of the machine, with the cables hidden out of sight.

The Antec P9 Window 
comes with three fans 
installed by default‚Äîone at 
the rear, which covers the main 
processor block, and two at the 
front, behind the drive cages. 
These set up a good Ô¨Çow of air 
through the system, and we had 
no problems with heat.
2
We needed to remove this 
middle drive cage in order 
Ô¨Åt the triple-fan RX 480 in place. 
These cages offer tool-free 
brackets for up to four hard 
drives apiece, while the top cage 
can be home to up to three optical 
drives‚Äîagain, tool-free.

The top of the Antec P9 
Window offers a pair of 
USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, 
audio connectors, and sliders for

another neat touch.
THERE‚ÄôS LITTLE DOUBT in our minds that 
the Ryzen 7 1700 is an incredible chip, and it 
offers some great opportunities for building 
systems at a number of price points. Our plan 
was to build a system that offered strong 
performance, but was still reasonably priced, 
and to an extent we hit that main requirement 
with little hassle. As we‚Äôre at the very start of 
a new family of chips, we haven‚Äôt had chance 
to try all the different motherboard SKUs yet, 
and there are some questions over memory 
performance at this stage, so we‚Äôd expect to 
tweak a mainstream build like this as we Ô¨Ånd 
out more, but it certainly shows promise.
Before we say anything else, we‚Äôd like to 
call out the Antec P9 Window for being a great 
case to build in. For a sub-$100 chassis, it 
offers plenty of features to make life easier, 
and while things are cramped in the back, it‚Äôs 
better than a lot of cases we‚Äôve looked at. The 
tool-free drive cages work well, and removing 
them couldn‚Äôt be any easier, should you need 
to make room for a longer graphics card.
On to performance. Normally we compare 
our 
monthly 
build 
with 
our 
standard 
desktop zero-point, but that machine costs 
considerably more than this system, so we‚Äôve 
instead compared it to last month‚Äôs build, 
which was based on AMD‚Äôs FX-8370E, and 
rolled in at roughly the same price. 
The differences are impressive, and show 
just how far AMD has managed to come with 
Ryzen compared to the outgoing Bulldozer 
architecture. The Cinebench R15 scores clearly 
show the advances: The multi-threaded score 
is to be expected when you‚Äôre going from an 
8-thread chip to one with 16 threads, but it‚Äôs 
the single-thread performance that really 
stands out. That 61 percent improvement 
shows that this is a signiÔ¨Åcantly different core 
more than anything else.
The 
gaming 
scores 
aren‚Äôt 
as 
straightforward to interpret, as we‚Äôre going 
from a last-gen GTX 960 with 2GB of RAM to a 
current-generation RX 480 with 8GB of RAM, 
which costs $60 more. Still, the differences 
are stark, and in many cases represent a shift 
from having to dial down settings in order to 
hit smooth frame rates, to being smooth off 
the bat. In real terms, you may have to ease 
back on some settings on newer releases, but 
this is a machine that will last some time‚Äî
and if you‚Äôre serious about gaming, a faster 
graphics card makes for a wise investment. 
Overall, 
we‚Äôve 
enjoyed 
building 
this 
machine, and we‚Äôre happy with the end result. 
That hasn‚Äôt stopped us looking forward to 
seeing what the rest of the Ryzen family serves 
up, though‚Äîwe should have the Ô¨Årst Ryzen 5 
chips next month, with Ryzen 3 dropping later 
in the year. We‚Äôre also intrigued to see what 
the Ô¨Årst Ryzen APUs dish up.

A YEAR AGO, we reviewed Nvidia‚Äôs Ô¨Årst 
Pascal card, the GTX 1080. Coming in 
at $700, it shocked the tech sphere with 
its exceptional performance. It wasn‚Äôt 
just a rebadge, or a meager 10 percent 
improvement over the previous generation, 
but a card that took the last-gen Titan X, 
and threw it to the curb. Nvidia justiÔ¨Åed 
the price by saying it was just right for the 
stunning level of performance. The tech 
community faltered‚Äîa card that would 
usually cost around $500 was hit by an 
increase of almost 40 percent.
Fast-forward 10 months, and the 
ecosystem hasn‚Äôt entirely changed. Nvidia 
is still ruling the roost when it comes to 
those heady graphical heights, and with the 
developer-focused Titan X coming in at an 
eye-watering $1,200, for what amounts to a 
10‚Äì15 percent performance increase over

$500 more, and comes in at the same 
price that the GTX 1080 cost 10 months 
ago (that‚Äôs 50 cents degradation in value 
per day for the lucky FE owners out there). 
That said, it‚Äôs hard to argue against the

is arguably leveraging due to the lack of 
any signiÔ¨Åcant competition, this still, oddly, 
feels like a good deal. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY
its GTX 1080 sibling, the GTX 1080 was the 
go-to choice. Until now.
The new GTX 1080 Ti costs $700. Like an 
odd, red-headed stepchild, it sits eagerly 
between the GTX 1080 and Titan XP early 
adopters. Featuring the same full-fat 
12 billion transistor-laden GP102 core 
found in the Titan XP, the Ti also comes with 
the same 3,584 CUDA cores and 224 Texture 
Units. The big one, though, is the VRAM, or 
rather, the butchering that‚Äôs occurred to 
that poor Titan‚Äôs core: 11GB of GDDR5X, 
instead of 12GB, a 352-bit bus versus a 384-
bit memory bus, and, of course, 88 ROPs‚Äî
eight fewer than the XP. Apart from that, 
the Ti gets some signiÔ¨Åcant upgrades when 
it comes to clock speeds. It has a tighter 
and higher base to boost clock, and also 
comes packing an 11Gb/s memory clock, 
versus the rest of the 1000 series‚Äôs 10Gb/s.
What about performance? In all honesty, 
it‚Äôs very impressive. This is the Ô¨Årst card 
we‚Äôve seen hit near enough 60fps averages 
in our testing suite at 4K, with all the tests 
ramped up, hitting 56fps in Far Cry Primal, 
and 55 in The Division. Rise of the Tomb 
Raider still tanks fairly low, at console-
level frame rates, hitting 29fps, with Attila 
matching at 27, but all in all, it‚Äôs good.
GPU Boost helps no end, with our 
particular retail card hitting 1,800MHz on 
the core clock‚Äîalmost 300MHz higher 
than the rated turbo clock. This was a trend 
that we pushed further in overclocking. 
Using EVGA‚Äôs Precision XOC, we managed 
to bump up the core clocks by an additional 
155MHz, and the memory by a staggering 
500MHz, leaving us with a max core clock 
of 2,062MHz, and memory at 6GHz, giving 
us a total of 12Gb/s bandwidth, leading to a 
10 percent improvement in both minimum 
and average frame rates at 4K, while 
simultaneously bumping up our Fire Strike 
Ô¨Ågures by almost 2,000 points at 1080p.
All things considered, the GTX 1080

RYZEN IS HERE AT LAST and it‚Äôs good. You 
can Ô¨Ånd out exactly why on page 34. But 
let‚Äôs assume you buy into the broader 
proposition offered by AMD‚Äôs hot new CPU. 
You then need to decide between the three 
eight-core models available from day one.
While AMD has plans for quad-core 
and six-core variants, they won‚Äôt appear 
for several months. In the meantime, it‚Äôs 
the launch trio of Ryzen 7 1700, 1700X, 
and 1800X that demands your attention. 
The top-drawer 1800X model looks like 
a marginal proposition in value terms. 
For a $100 premium, the 1800X buys you 
200MHz. That‚Äôs it. No additional features, 
no extra cache memory, just a mere Ô¨Åve 
percent uptick in operating frequency, in 
return for 25 percent more money. Ouch!
At the other end of the scale is the entry-
level Ryzen 7 1700. For $329, it looks like 
a steal for a cutting-edge CPU, with eight 
cores, and 16 threads. But with a base clock 
of just 3GHz, and no support for AMD‚Äôs new 
XFR automated overclocking feature, those 
savings come at a price.
So, could the 1700X be the Goldilocks of 
the Ryzen range‚Äîneither too expensive 
nor too compromised? The clocks come in 
at 3.4GHz nominal and 3.8GHz Turbo. You 
get the same 16MB of shared L3 cache as 
the 1800X, and likewise both an unlocked 
multiplier for easy overclocking, and the 
XFR feature. Time to Ô¨Ånd out what she‚Äôll do.

such 
as 
content 
creation, 
media 
encoding, that sort of thing. Somehow, 
AMD‚Äôs engineers have come up with a 
simultaneous multi-threading technology 
that‚Äôs even more efÔ¨Åcient than Intel‚Äôs 
Hyper-Threading. The result is that this 
eight-core chip monsters tasks like video 
encoding or professional image rendering.
For those kinds of jobs, this mere $399 
chip is roughly on a par with Intel‚Äôs $1,000 
Core i7-6900K beast. Meanwhile, it utterly 
obliterates the best of Intel‚Äôs CPUs for the 
mainstream LGA1151 socket, the $350 Core 
i7-7700K. Following that initial victory, the 
picture becomes more nuanced. 
SINGLED OUT
In anything single-threaded, this chip isn‚Äôt 
quite such a killer. Depending on what 
Intel CPU you care to compare it with, 
you‚Äôre looking at a performance deÔ¨Åcit of 
anywhere from around 10 to 20 percent. 
Roughly 10 percent of that is down to 
AMD‚Äôs Zen architecture not being quite as 
powerful on a per-core and per-clock basis 
as Intel‚Äôs latest CPU designs. The other 10 
percent is thanks to clock speeds that are 
just a little off Intel‚Äôs pace.
Speaking of clock speeds, one notable 
disappointment with all Ryzen CPUs we‚Äôve 
seen is moderate overclocking headroom. 
With an ofÔ¨Åcial Turbo speed of 3.8GHz, you 
might think 4GHz or more is on the cards, 
courtesy of that unlocked multiplier. Sadly 
not. Our sample chip could only keep its 
act together at 3.9GHz, making for an 
overclock of just 100MHz. AMD‚Äôs snazzy 
new XFR automated overclocking feature 
couldn‚Äôt do any better, either. That said, in 
testing at stock settings, our 1700X ran at 
3.5GHz during heavily threaded workloads. 
In other words, 3.9GHz represents more 
like a 400MHz overclock in the real world.
However, 
Ryzen‚Äôs 
most 
obvious 
weakness involves gaming. The precise 
reasons are unclear. Very likely, the fact 
that no existing PC games are compiled 
and optimized for what is a brand new CPU 
architecture is at least partly to blame. But 
there‚Äôs no denying the 1700X sometimes 
struggles to keep up with Intel CPUs in 
games. Most of the time, that‚Äôs moot. 
Whether you‚Äôre getting 120 frames per 
second or 150 is academic. But in those 
few titles that really make heavy demands 
of your CPU, it could be the difference 
between smoothness and stutter. Of 
course, if you don‚Äôt game, that hardly 
matters. For everything else, this is one 
hell of a CPU. ‚ÄìJEREMY LAIRD

BREAKING THE NORMS of price to processing 
power is something AMD has progressively 
done with its Ryzen series of CPUs. Its 
1800X and 1700X have dominated our 
testing suites recently, demolishing the 
competition. But both of those feel like 
mere footnotes in contrast to the sheer 
power AMD has managed to leverage into 
the core complexes buried at the heart of 
its Ryzen architecture.
We‚Äôve repeatedly said that the 1800X 
and 1700X fall a little Ô¨Çat when it comes 
to overclocking, with the 1800X managing 
a meager 300MHz overclock, at most, on 
all of its cores, and the 1700X just a touch 
higher than that. Not too impressive for a 
chip with a 95W TDP. That said, for the price, 
and in contrast to their blue counterparts, 
both chips are simply staggering.
The 1700, then, makes the 1800X look 
like a kitten in comparison. Differences 
are few and far between: You lose out on 
the XFR (extended frequency) SenseMi 
software, which boosts a couple of cores 
higher, depending on your cooling solution, 
and the core clocks are far slower than 
either the 1700X or 1800X, coming in at a 
still respectable 3GHz, with a 3.7GHz turbo 
(only on four cores), but the 1700 has only

a 65W TDP, as opposed to the 95W pumped 
into its power-hungry compadres.
By default, the performance Ô¨Ågures 
are pretty solid‚Äî24.12fps in our X265 
benchmark and 1,406 in Cinebench put 
this core in 6900K territory, a processor 
that comes in at a whopping $720 more. 
The thing is, this core doesn‚Äôt stop there. 
All of Ryzen‚Äôs lineup is overclockable on 
any X370 or B350 motherboard‚Äîand, holy 
cow, does this chip overclock! We managed 
to bump all eight cores up to 3.9GHz, with 
very little trouble. Temperatures peaked at 
around 65 C under load, utilizing the NZXT 
Kraken X62, but what was more amazing 
was the fact that it even outperformed the 
the 1800X, while simultaneously drawing 
less power and running cooler (even 
allowing for AMD‚Äôs erroneous 20-degree 
temperature boost). 
Bumping the core clock up to 3.9GHz 
(bearing in mind that there have been 
reports of many hitting 4.1GHz under 
water), we saw an improvement of 18 
percent in Cinebench R15‚Äôs multi-threaded 
test, 7 percent in single-core performance, 
20 percent in our X265 benchmark, and a 
10 percent improvement in Fryrender, too. 
Which, let‚Äôs face it, is truly incredible for a 
core that costs $330‚Äî20 bucks less than a 
Core i7-7700K.
So, is it all a bed of roses? Not quite. Our 
sample was plagued by memory issues. 
Testing across multiple motherboards and 
memory kits, we struggled to get any to 
operate beyond 2,133MT/s. After speaking 
to AMD and running multiple tests, we 
came to the conclusion that our particular 
sample was damaged, so we wouldn‚Äôt 
expect to encounter the same problems 
with other specimens.
Generally speaking, Ryzen‚Äôs memory 
support isn‚Äôt perfect just yet, and, yes, 
there are scheduling issues, but these 
are all to be expected with a brand new 
architecture design. Look back several 
years to Nehalem, and the birth of Intel‚Äôs 
core architecture, and you can see 
the same issues occurring there, too. 
Ultimately, however, teething issues aside, 
this chip is nigh on godly, and if we could 
give it a 10, we would. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

WE‚ÄôVE TAKEN TO calling the Aegis Ti3 
‚ÄúOptimus Prime‚Äù around the ofÔ¨Åce, though 
perhaps ‚ÄúMegatron‚Äù is more appropriate. 
With angular features and red and 
black styling, the Aegis Ti3 looks more 
Decepticon than Autobot, but we can‚Äôt hold 
that against it‚Äîespecially considering the 
power locked inside. 
The Ti3 marks the third generation of 
MSI‚Äôs Aegis gaming desktops, and this 
iteration updates the system with an Intel 
Kaby Lake processor‚Äîa 4.2GHz Core 
i7-7700K, with the turbo raised from 4.5 
to 4.8GHz. Also slotted in the MSI Z270 
motherboard is a ludicrous 64GB of DDR4-
2400 RAM‚Äîan absurd amount that‚Äôs more 
than enough for any pile of tasks you might 
have in mind. The result is solid scores 
in Cinebench R15 (1,032) and Tech ARP‚Äôs 
x264 (23.22fps), though that latter number 
comes with a caveat, because x264 crashed 
the Ô¨Årst few times we tried running it. 
Apparently, the factory CPU bump was only 
done to the clock speed, not the voltage, 
resulting in some instability under heavy 
load. It was only after bumping the voltage 
up a tad that the test completed without 
a hitch. 
On the storage front, a pair of M.2 drives 
in RAID 0 amount to 1TB of NVMe SSD space 
for all your games, programs, and OS, 
while a 3TB HDD takes care of media cold 
storage. But what the SSDs have in sheer 
size, they lose in performance, falling

and good, but the Aegis Ti3 is a gaming 
system Ô¨Årst and foremost. To prove it, 
pixel-pushing is handled by a pair of GTX 
1080s in SLI. We‚Äôve had some issues 
with SLI performance in the past‚Äî
especially at 1080p‚Äîbut things have 
gotten considerably better recently due to 
updated drivers. We performed testing on 
Nvidia‚Äôs 378.78 drivers, which added SLI 
proÔ¨Åles for a handful of games, as well 
as optimizations for DirectX 12. The latter 
proved considerably helpful in Rise of the 
Tomb Raider, where we‚Äôve often found 
dual-GPU systems to perform better at 
1080p with SLI disabled. 
Not so this time. With DirectX 12 
enabled, the Aegis Ti3 landed some of the 
best scores we‚Äôve ever seen in Rise of the 
Tomb Raider. At 1080p max settings, the 
Ti3 averaged 166fps across the game‚Äôs 
three-part benchmark (219fps mountain 
peak, 144fps Syria, 133fps geothermal 
valley). 1440p and 4K performance was 
just as impressive, averaging 151fps in the 
former and 87fps in the latter‚Äîboth at max 
settings. The Division fared similarly, with 
140fps at 1080p, 105 at 1440p, and 65 at 
4K. Those numbers were without DirectX 
12, though, because enabling it resulted in 
knocking our frame rates down by around 
30 percent. 
Far Cry Primal was a different story. 
Continuing to be one of the most difÔ¨Åcult 
games to land a high frame rate at lower 
resolutions, the game scored almost 
exactly the same at 1080p and 1440p max 
settings: 88 and 87fps respectively. 4K 
wasn‚Äôt much below that either, with 72fps‚Äî
again, with settings at the highest preset. 
Finally, 3DMark Fire Strike returned 
excellent scores: 24,134 for the regular 
1080p test, 16,074 at 1440p, and 9,115 in the 
4K gauntlet of Fire Strike Ultra. 
All told, the Aegis Ti3 is an incredibly 
capable gaming machine, with aggressive 
styling to match. The slanted case is a bit 
odd to look at, but it‚Äôs actually quite compact 
(20.1 x 19.9 x 6.7 inches) considering how 
much is inside. The carrying handle is a nice 
touch, too, making the system easy to tote, 
despite its weight (31.5lb). But hopefully 
you‚Äôre happy with the insides‚Äîaccording to 
stickers on the back panel screws, opening 
the case violates the warranty. ‚ÄìBO MOORE

AOC‚Äôs latest gaming panel looks 
preposterous on paper. 
in the lab
84
MAXIMUMPC
maximumpc.com
MAY 2017

NOT LONG AGO, the basic premise of this new 
AOC panel would have been preposterous. 
Measuring 35 inches diagonally, with a 
superwide 21:9 aspect ratio, and capable 
of no fewer than 200 refresh cycles per 
second, 
along 
with 
frame-synching 
technology in the form of AMD‚Äôs FreeSync, 
it‚Äôs an absolute monster. It‚Äôs curved, too, 
and sports VA panel technology.
So, it says a lot about how far things have 
moved on in the last 18 months that not 
only has much of the above become, if not 
mainstream, then at least unremarkable, 
but we are also balking at one particular 
speciÔ¨Åcation: The new AOC Agon AG352QCX 
gives you a mere 2560x1080 pixels.
Again, a few years ago, that would have 
been impressive. Today, and especially 
with a panel this large, on which you might 
expect to see 3440x1440 pixels, it looks 
a bit puny. To put it another way, the net 
result is pixels that look pretty fat. Putting 
a precise number on that, it works out at 
79 pixels per inch. In a world where a mid-
range smartphone packs nearer 300 pixels 
per inch, and a 27-inch WQHD display 
offers 50 percent more, this new AOC is at 
a disadvantage. But hold that thought while 
we consider its broader qualities.
It looks impressive, physically, as it 
ought to for the money, even if the gamer-
centric LED lighting is a little adolescent 
for some tastes. The stand is also fully 
adjustable, bar the facility to rotate from 
landscape to portrait‚Äîunderstandable, 
given its ultra-wide form factor.
As for image quality, pixel pitch aside, 
it‚Äôs a mixed bag. The use of VA rather than 
IPS panel technology would normally have 
you expecting some seriously saturated 
visuals. But the truth is that this panel 
lacks punch. Yes, there‚Äôs good detail in both 
black and white scales and the objective 
contrast performance, as indicated by a 
claimed static ratio of 2,000:1. But quite 
a bit of banding is visible in gradients, the 
viewing angles aren‚Äôt as expansive as the 
best IPS panels, and various degrees of 
ghosting are visible, depending on how you 
set the overdrive option in the OSD menu. 
That‚Äôs not a huge surprise, given the pixel 
response is the weakest attribute of any 
VA monitor, but it is an issue for a monitor 
primarily pitched at gamers.
Speaking of which, this monitor still 
makes most sense for gaming. While the 
native resolution translates into relatively 
ugly font rendering and limited desktop 
High-refresh Hz meets low-res hurts

space, it also means less load on your GPU. 
That means better frame rates, and it gives 
you half a chance to make the most of what 
is perhaps this monitor‚Äôs biggest selling 
point: a 200Hz refresh rate.
That‚Äôs a big number, and immediately 
begs the question of whether one can 
truly tell the difference between, say, 
120Hz and 200Hz. The answer is that 
each person has different sensitivities to 
refresh rates, but, yes, we could tell the 
difference. The smoothness and stability 
of a monitor running at 200Hz is undeniably 
something special. However, even with a 
very powerful video card, and factoring 
in the relatively modest native resolution, 
achieving anything like 200fps in the latest 
games is fairly fanciful.
You do, of course, have the FreeSync 
technology 
to 
fall 
back 
on, 
adding 
smoothness at lower frame rates, but 
that‚Äôs limited to AMD video cards, and 
doesn‚Äôt make the 200Hz feature any more 
relevant. All of which means the AOC Agon 
AG352QCX is an unusual mix of Ô¨Çaws and 
nevertheless-compelling features. Were it 
a little cheaper, it would probably carve out 
its own niche, but it‚Äôs pretty pricey, so it‚Äôs a 
fairly hard sell. ‚ÄìJEREMY LAIRD

DELL‚ÄôS XPS 13 LINEAGE, now in its sixth 
generation, has long been regarded as the 
pinnacle of svelte laptops. When they Ô¨Årst 
appeared in the wild, people were amazed 
that such a Ô¨Ånely crafted product could 
be made outside of the fruity conÔ¨Ånes of 
InÔ¨Ånite Loop. Over its lifespan, Dell has 
tweaked the design, updated the hardware, 
and, back in 2015, added the InÔ¨Ånity Edge 
display. This made a rather tempting 
piece of hardware extremely so‚Äîwho can 
resist the non-Euclidean charms of a 13-
inch display Ô¨Åtting inside an 11-inch case? 
Especially when said display is a beautiful 
QHD+ touch affair. Aesthetics aside, Dell‚Äôs 
other trick here has been its support of 
Linux on its hardware. Since its inception, 
the XPS 13 range has been available in a 
Developer Edition, which features identical 
hardware, but runs Ubuntu Linux.
Linux has come a long way over the 
years, and will at least ‚Äújust about work‚Äù 
(one day, we‚Äôll be able to omit ‚Äúabout‚Äù) 
on an awful lot of hardware. But Dell has 
invested considerable effort in making 
sure hardware behaves itself, and the 
Linux experience is second to none. Of 
course, buying an expensive laptop just 
because it has a working copy of Linux on it 
isn‚Äôt the best use of one‚Äôs smarts, though it 
may well save some shouting, wailing, and 
gnashing of teeth if you were otherwise 
going to do the install yourself. Dell 
provides its own package and Ô¨Årmware 
updates, and maintains an active forum of 
Developer Edition users.
In many ways, this sixth edition is just 
a reÔ¨Ånement of a well-proven recipe. The 
machine is now powered by a Kaby Lake 
chip, which brings improved battery life 
and better performance. It‚Äôs marginally 
lighter and inÔ¨Ånitesimally smaller. It 
runs a newer version of Ubuntu: 16.04, as 
opposed to 14.04. And it comes with a new 
Killer Wi-Fi chip. Wi-Fi is an oft-cursed 
bugbear on Linux, but we found the new 
device worked well, easily sustaining

about 24 feet. Cosmetically, it looks much 
the same as the previous iteration, with 
a delightful woven effect atop the carbon 
Ô¨Åber chassis, a keyboard that‚Äôs satisfying 
to type on, and a backlight behind said 
keyboard, which you can softly transition 
between two levels of illumination. Oh, 
and if you opt for the touch model, you get 
the same delightful, vibrant display that 
makes anything with eyes jealous.
ASSAULT ON BATTERY
Irks remain from the previous model, too‚Äî
there‚Äôs still no room to put the webcam, 
other than off to the left below the display, 
nor is there room for a larger trackpad, 
and the squished cursor keys won‚Äôt be 
to everyone‚Äôs liking. The OS update is 
welcome (14.04 was released a long time 
ago), but Ubuntu 16.04 features Kernel 4.4, 
and certain Kaby Lake features were not 
added until 4.8. That‚Äôs not to say the chip 
doesn‚Äôt work, just that the ‚Äúdeeper sleep‚Äù 
C-states provided by Kaby Lake aren‚Äôt 
slumbered into, so the battery is drained 
slightly quicker. This is a sad consequence 
of the awkward cadences between Kernel, 
distro, and hardware releases. However, 
there‚Äôs no need to install a whole new 
OS to get everything working optimally; 
the handy Ubuntu Hardware Enablement 
(HWE) update can take care of that for 
you. With a single command, a 4.8 series 
kernel and an updated graphics stack are 
all yours. Incidentally, we managed to get 
about 7.5 hours of battery life looping a 
720p h.264 video before installing the HWE 
packages, which jumped up to eight hours 
afterward. The non-touch model should 
see closer to 11 hours, having fewer pixels 
to illuminate. The new video drivers didn‚Äôt 
seem to improve things‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt really a 
gaming machine, but it did manage 2015‚Äôs 
Linux port of Bioshock InÔ¨Ånite at an almost 
playable 26fps, with high detail at 1600x900

FORGET GRAPHICS CARDS, motherboards, 
and monitors. The mechanical keyboard 
market is one of the most hotly contested 
hardware sectors, and rightly so. The 
tactile experience of interacting with your 
PC is almost entirely determined by the 
tool you use, so a change of keyboard‚Äî
particularly if moving away from a soft, 
rubbery membrane matrix to one with 
satisfying bite‚Äîcan have a big impact. 
Accordingly, everyone and their mother 
has a set of crunchy keys on the market, 
and while this is Creative‚Äôs Ô¨Årst time 
dipping its toe in the water, the company 
has already spotted the big selling point to 
many loose-pocketed buyers: pretty lights.
The K08‚Äôs RGB lighting is equal parts 
Ô¨Çexible and obtuse. Changing it is only 
possible by using Creative‚Äôs somewhat 
difÔ¨Åcult Sound Blaster Connect software‚Äî
so you‚Äôre out of luck if you‚Äôre not at your 
PC or if using a non-Windows OS‚Äîand its 
multilayer construction takes a while to get 
your head around. Put simply, you Ô¨Årst set a 
multicolored animated layer, tweaking the 
speed, pattern, and precise color scheme. 
Then you add a static layer on top, enabling 
you to pick out individual keys, and assign 
them each a color of your choice, leaving 
the bottom layer shining through as you 
see Ô¨Åt. The combo of well-coated key caps, 
a white backing, and the full 16.8-million-
color RGB range makes it really pop. The 
whole lot integrates with other hardware 
that supports Aurora reactive lighting, too, 
so you could potentially sync up your whole 
desk. It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs no way to change 
the key colors from the hardware itself, 
and equally that activation of the likes of 
Caps Lock is represented by awkward little 
Lights and sounds‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not all desirable
white LEDs, rather than custom colors on 
the actual keys, but these are nitpicks.  
In terms of overall design, Creative 
has outdone itself with its debut keyboard 
outing. The unit itself is weighty and well 
put together, featuring a row of lower-
proÔ¨Åle dome-switched media keys, an 
incredibly satisfying volume roller, and a 
string of Ô¨Åve macro keys. Our lizard brains 
initially struggled with the position of these 
keys, sitting as they do along the left edge 
of the keyboard, but it actually makes a 
huge amount of sense‚Äîif your left hand is 
sitting over the WASD keys, they‚Äôre easily 
reached with a nimble pinky. Customizing 
them is, again, done through Sound 
Blaster Connect, and they‚Äîand indeed any 
of the K08‚Äôs keys‚Äîcan be set to perform 
just about any action, from keypresses to 
mouse functions to custom recordings. 
NOISES OFF
So, functionality, design, aesthetics: all 
brilliant. But a mechanical keyboard 
truly lives and dies by its microswitches. 
Creative has selected a custom switch, 
designed in collaboration with Omron, 
which it dubs the PRES (‚ÄúPerceive-React-
Execute Switch‚Äù). It has a shorter travel 
to activation than competing Cherry 
switches, and the switch itself is silent and 
rather soft; we‚Äôd place it toward the Cherry 
MX Black end of the audible spectrum. The 
K08 is absolutely Ô¨Åne to type on, and while it 
lacks the visceral edge of stiffer switches, 
your Ô¨Ångers will get tired less quickly. 
Beware typing fast, or at all, though: 
Every clack down of a keycap to the base 
of the unit causes a rather loud ringing 
sound. Even just tapping an empty space 
on the unit is enough to set it singing like a 
Tibetan bowl. We suspect this is an artefact 
of the springs used in these particular 
switches‚Äîa similar harmonic tone is 
present in other mechanical keyboards, 
but we‚Äôve never known a keyboard to be 
quite as loud and, frankly, irritating as we 
found this one. We can‚Äôt really fault the 
hardware itself‚Äîit‚Äôs a quality, if rather 
pricey, package‚Äîbut be prepared to don 
headphones if you‚Äôre getting down to some 
serious work. ‚ÄìALEX COX

A NAME ONCE familiar to PC builders, 
before onboard sound on motherboards 
ruined its fun, Creative Labs has been 
branching out as more of a general 
peripherals manufacturer, keeping the 
Sound Blaster name alive, and focusing on 
sound with ampliÔ¨Åers, headsets, and even 
PCIe soundcards, while also producing 
keyboards, webcams, and, now, mice.
The Siege M04 has a truly awful name, 
but one or two things going for it. The Ô¨Årst 
is something of an oddity, a celebration of 
absence in a marketplace where more is 
always, well, more: the complete lack of 
software prediction of where your pointer 
will end up, and no acceleration (although 
you can turn this on in software). This, 
according to Creative, leads to a more 
precise mouse, and maybe when you‚Äôre 
playing an RTS in 4K, this will be the case. 
In the real world, we found it very hard to 
notice a difference. 
Adding to the chorus of precision is a 
PixArt PMW3360 IR LED sensor (‚ÄúGaming 
Grade‚Äù apparently, but given you can game 
with a touchpad, we‚Äôre not sure exactly 
what this is trying to tell us), with its own 
32-bit controller chip. This sort of thing is 
standard for pricier pointing devices these 
days, and, to be honest, we‚Äôd have been a 
bit disappointed if it hadn‚Äôt featured.
The Siege is one of the Ô¨Årst mice we‚Äôve 
encountered that needs a Ô¨Årmware update 
before all its functions work correctly. 
We shouldn‚Äôt complain‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign of 
Creative‚Äôs commitment to supporting the 
product, after all, and we had to update the 
Ô¨Årmware on a memory card reader once‚Äî
but we‚Äôve got used to things just working 
when we plug them in.
Physically, the Siege is a long and tall 
mouse, enabling palm-grippers to get 
A precision gaming 
mouse. Give it a big 
hand‚Äîit needs one
plenty of contact, and with enough ribbed 
rubber patches for claw-grippers to be 
able to get a purchase, too. It‚Äôs not going 
to be the claw-gripper‚Äôs mouse of choice, 
however, and left-handers are completely 
out of luck, thanks to the Siege's righties-
only ergonomics. It‚Äôs nicely built, though, 
with the two main buttons as separate 
panels, rather than blending seamlessly 
into the top surface of the mouse, as we‚Äôve 
seen from many other manufacturers, 
and it doesn‚Äôt crunch or Ô¨Çex too much 
when you squeeze it. Lighting is conÔ¨Åned 
to the mouse wheel, an X logo on top, and 
a strip around the bottom of the mouse 
body. It‚Äôs almost tasteful, in fact, and 
easily controlled from the Sound Blaster 
Connect software.
UNDER THE THUMB
It‚Äôs when you start to use the thing that 
doubts begin to creep in. Despite being the 
right size for the Maximum PC Test Hand, 
which is one of the biggest we could Ô¨Ånd, 
the side button placement necessitates 
using a position slightly too far toward 
the front of the mouse to be called truly 
comfortable. If you like to lazily rest your 
wrist on the desk or mousepad as you 
rodent about, the sniper button, low and 
front on the mouse‚Äôs left, is completely out 
of reach. Every button is programmable in 
Sound Blaster Connect, so you‚Äôre losing 
14 percent of your programmability just 
because your thumbs are stumpy. The top 
two side buttons sidestep any problems, 
by being long enough to press from any 
position, while the wheel has a decent 
rubber tire, and rolls easily under gentle 
Ô¨Ånger pressure.
Creative‚Äôs stab at a mouse isn‚Äôt bad at 
all, let down only by some suspect button 
placement and excessive length. Its main 
issue is that, for slightly less money, you 
can get several models of Logitech mouse, 
including the G502 Proteus Spectrum. And 
that‚Äôs a problem Creative is going to have 
to work hard to overcome. ‚ÄìIAN EVENDEN

OH, BITFENIX, you‚Äôve really wowed us in 
the past with your eccentric designs. And 
your desire to innovate in a Ô¨Åeld that‚Äôs 
becoming ever more overcrowded with a 
barrage of rectangular boxes has inspired 
us in ways you could only imagine. The 
Shinobi, the Prodigy, the Phenom, that 
soft-touch Ô¨Ånish, the 230mm intake fans‚Äî
all fantastic ideas.
The Shogun is the latest in BitFenix‚Äôs 
vast arsenal of case designs. A mighty 
beast of bedlam, it‚Äôs more akin to the 
heritage of the Shinobi and Prodigy than 
any other chassis in its vast line-up. And, 
boy, is it a beauty! Although it lacks the 
soft-touch Ô¨Ånish of its predecessors, the 
curved aluminum base and roof panels 
add an elegance that truly awes‚Äîthough 
more when you see it in person than any 
photography could ever show. Couple that 
with its unfettered airÔ¨Çow access, and it‚Äôs 
plain to see why this was such a solid idea.
But it‚Äôs the stance of the chassis that‚Äôs 
most impressive. Like most premium 
cases released over the last six months, 
the Shogun features tempered glass 
side panels, front and rear. Unlike the 
competition, however, the panels are 
slanted down the side of the case. This 
gives a fantastic edge to the square design, 
mixing curves with straight lines to form 
an amazing aesthetic appeal.
The Shogun‚Äôs not just a pretty face, 
either. It comes packed with some neat 
additions, too, including two side-panel-
facing SSD mounts with RGB LED lighting, 
conÔ¨Ågurable with Asus‚Äôs Aura Sync, and

three ‚ÄúGPU Safe‚Äù mounts, that help reduce 
GPU sag on long cards and during travel.
Cooling, however, is where the Shogun 
really shines. Supporting up to three 
140mm fans in the front, three 120mm 
or two 140mm fans in the roof, and one 
140mm fan in the rear, the liquid-cooling 
potential is massive. With additional 
recessed 
radiator 
mounting 
points 
embedded into the chassis itself, it makes 
any liquid or air-cooling setup a reality, 
with little to no fuss.
There‚Äôs no PSU cover as such, but the 
SSD mounting panel does lend itself to 
obscuring the vast majority of the power 
supply and any supporting cables from a 
sideways glance. The only way you‚Äôll spot 
the PSU or its associated cables is by 
peering down into the chassis from above. 
Hardly a run-of-the-mill scenario. 
Total hard drive support is elegantly 
covered by the two RGB 2.5-inch mounts 
on the side, another two on the rear of the 
motherboard tray, then a further six 3.5-
inch drive bays, which can be converted to 
work with 2.5-inch devices as well. 
The Shogun reminds us of its now-
ancient Shinobi cousin, but with a lot 
more modern conveniences. Although 
the SSD mounting positions may not be 
to everyone‚Äôs tastes, it‚Äôs hard to argue 
that 
BitFenix 
hasn‚Äôt 
got 
everyone‚Äôs 
conÔ¨Åguration covered. Whether you‚Äôre 
an enthusiast liquid-cooler, a weekend 
AIO overclocking junkie, or an air-cooled 
3D-modeling professional, it‚Äôs likely the 
Shogun can do it for you. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT you were doing in

civilization coming to terms with the detritus

their functions a puzzle that may never be 
solved. These are the Numenera, and even

In which your crack squad takes on the crack squad
Ghost Recon Wildlands
WHEN WE REVIEWED Far Cry Primal, we 
lamented that a Ubisoft studio had ‚Äúmade 
its game again.‚Äù Well, it‚Äôs happened once 
more, this time dragging a Tom Clancy 
franchise into the open world with it.
Your elite combat squad is in Bolivia to 
take down the head of the Santa Blanca 
drug cartel, a man with more lieutenants 
than the entire US Army. Those lieutenants 
need to be reduced to a thin red mist before 
you can have a crack at the top man. 
Bolivia is cut from huge and beautiful 
cloth, but it‚Äôs a diaphanous fabric that 
exposes the size-zero bones of the 
supporting structure. Outposts are the 
bolts that hold the game together, and you 
raid them in the same way you did in Far 
Cry 4, collecting intel, weapons, skill points, 
and other goodies, until you‚Äôre ready to take 
on the area‚Äôs boss character, after which 
you can move on to another part of the 
country (there are many), and do it all again. 
The feeling of being able to tackle 
outposts in any way you want is palpable‚Äî
frustrated by being spotted after a couple 
failed stealth inÔ¨Åltrations with the aim of 
when you Ô¨Ånd some cartel soldiers, even 
though you left them back at base. 
With this structure and focus on base-
exploding, perhaps the most recent analog 
to Wildlands is Just Cause 3, rather than 
Future Soldier. Run in, cause chaos, get out 
is as valid a way to play as sneaking around 
unseen, but the Ghosts‚Äô drone is a poor 
replacement for Rico‚Äôs grappling hook.
Wildlands can be a hoot in co-op, as the 
interaction with real people glosses over 
its repetitive nature. A focus on breadth 
of experience‚Äînot landscape‚Äîmight have 
gone a long way toward making this a more 
satisfying open-world game. ‚ÄìIAN EVENDEN
Custom characters don‚Äôt 
always look like special 
forces operators.
Helicopters are the best 
way to get about, as the 
roads are rather windy.
The game supports Nvidia 
GameWorks‚Äô Turf Effects  
for nicely tessellated grass.
Why you‚Äôd drive one 
of these over dirt 
roads is beyond us.
stealing a car, we landed a helicopter on 
the garage roof, ran down a Ô¨Åre escape, and 
drove off into the night. A swift grenade took 
out a boss with a minigun, who could have 
leveled our entire squad. But this open-
ended approach doesn‚Äôt mask the fact that 
it‚Äôs the same old thing over and over again. 
There is some attempt to mix things up, 
with frantic cross-country chases to switch 
off radio beacons, convoys full of resources 
to be hunted down, and skills to be learned 
that boost your character‚Äôs abilities. The 
game is also designed with co-op play at its 
heart, as illustrated by the Sync Shot, which 
sees your team take out up to four bad guys 
at once. With no buddies to play with, you‚Äôre 
left with bots, who display the useful ability 
to see drug enforcers through hills and 
walls, and can teleport to catch up with you. 
After playing ‚Äúproperly‚Äù in single-player, 
we soon learned to leave the bots behind, 
conÔ¨Ådent that they would pop into existence 
on the back seat of our truck. Teleporting 
bots make the dirt bikes you Ô¨Ånd dotted 
around useful for reconnaissance, as you 
can be sure your AI teammates will be there

INTEL RECENTLY REVEALED its newest SSD 
solution, the Optane SSD DC P4800X, a data-
center drive boasting extreme endurance. 
The 375GB model will be rated at 12‚Äì20PB of 
writes, or 30 complete drive writes per day 
for three to Ô¨Åve years. But endurance isn‚Äôt 
the only impressive aspect of Optane.
The drive will also have exceptional 
latency, typically less than 10 microseconds 
up to the 99th percentile. By comparison, 
Intel‚Äôs DC P3700 is a few thousand 
microseconds under similar workloads. 
Perhaps most importantly, Intel is promising 
breakthrough performance at low queue 
depths‚Äîeven though most SSDs are rated 
at QD32, in the real world, no SSD is running 
anything beyond maybe QD8, with over 95 
percent of operations taking place at QD1‚Äì4.
All of that should prove incredibly useful 
for servers, but we will have to wait until 
the second half of 2017 before we begin to 
see consumer versions of the drive. Which 
is probably for the best, because even the 
375GB model will set you back a staggering 
$1,520, never mind the future 750GB and 
1.5TB models.
Optane Memory is a different story, 
slated to launch within the month‚Äî
we‚Äôll have actual performance metrics 
available next issue. Optane Memory is less 
exciting, mostly because it has a limited 
area of use. For $45, Kaby Lake CPU and 
motherboard users can get a 16GB Optane 
Memory adapter that will improve system 
performance via intelligent caching, or $80 
will buy you a 32GB module.
And there‚Äôs the rub: How will a 1TB 
HDD plus 16GB Optane Memory solution 
fare compared to just buying a 480GB 
budget SSD? When the data you‚Äôre after is 
on the Optane cache, performance should 
be excellent, but if it‚Äôs not, and you have 
to go to the hard drive‚Ä¶ get ready to visit 
Sluggishville, USA. On the other hand, if 
you already have a Kaby Lake system, with 
or without an SSD, Optane Memory should 
make it better.

TESTED &
GEEK
APPROVED 
THIS IS REALLY GOOD. Seriously, it‚Äôs so 
good. I‚Äôve never been more impressed 
with a Bluetooth speaker than I have with 
the UE Wonderboom. To be fair, this was 
the Ô¨Årst UE device I‚Äôve ever tested, and 
only having the likes of Bose and Razer 
to compare it to may have muddied my 
views a touch as to what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood,‚Äù but 
even so, as a connoisseur of Ô¨Åne audio, I 
like to consider myself pretty well versed 
in the nuances of treble, bass, and mids.
So, what‚Äôs so special about the 
Wonderboom? Well, multiple things: 
It‚Äôs a small apple-shaped object, with 
3D positional sound, waterprooÔ¨Ång 
(IPX7), and a no-nonsense setup that just 
works. Unlike its Boom predecessors, it 
doesn‚Äôt come with any apps, or messing 
about‚Äîsimply hit the Bluetooth pairing 
button at the top, Ô¨Ånd it with your device, 
connect, and you‚Äôre good to go.
Once connected, you can actually pair 
the Wonderboom up with another one, to 
create a stereo setup (although it won‚Äôt 
pair beyond two), and use it wherever 
you like. It has a 30m range for mobile 
devices, too. It‚Äôs portable, and comes 
with a pretty meaty battery, allowing up 
to 10 hours‚Äô playback. That said, there‚Äôs 
no LED indicator for remaining battery 
life, but if you press the plus and minus 
volume controls twice simultaneously, 
you hear an audible indicator telling you 
many bars of battery you have left.
Couple all that with exceptionally crisp 
audio, and a price point of around $80 
(to be conÔ¨Årmed), and the Wonderboom 
rounds out to be an exceptionally 
pleasant 
addition 
to 
any 
techie‚Äôs 
arsenal. Whether you‚Äôre camping in the 
wilderness, traveling, or just using it in 
your kitchen, it‚Äôs right on point. ‚ÄìZS

THE CORSAIR ONE
I 
recently 
had 
the 
chance to play with a 
very 
special 
system 
from Corsair, called the 
Corsair One‚Äîcreative, 
I know. Sure, at Ô¨Årst glance, it‚Äôs a high-
performance gaming PC, packed tightly into 
a very svelte chassis made from aluminum. 
But what makes the Corsair One stand 
out isn‚Äôt its design or its performance; the 
Corsair One is special because it marks a 
major milestone in Corsair‚Äôs history books.
If you‚Äôve been around the scene long 
enough, you‚Äôll know that, originally, Corsair 
was primarily a DRAM module company. 
Then it started producing cases, and now it 
is a popular choice for all sorts of computer 
accessories. And I have to say, the company 
has been doing a damn good job in all of its 
product categories. Save for a few major 
bits, Corsair is now at the point where it 
makes almost every part of a complete 
computer. So, it makes perfect sense that 
the company is launching the Corsair One‚Äî
this is what makes the system special.
As a raw machine, the Corsair One is 
very well designed. The engineers and 
designers over at Corsair have used every 
possible nook and cranny of the chassis, 
and the design elements are as functional 
as 
they 
are 
good-
looking. It‚Äôs extremely 
well made, and I‚Äôve 
gotta give it to the 
company‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt 
been 
this 
excited 
about 
a

long time.

SNOWBLIND
I‚Äôve never been one 
for Ô¨Çashy RGB lighting 
arrays. 
I‚Äôll 
take 
an 
understated, minimalist 
box over aggressive ‚Äúgamer‚Äù stylings any 
day. But I might have found the thing to 
change my mind. I recently had the chance 
to go hands-on with iBuyPower‚Äôs new 
Snowblind PC, a pre-built system that really 
takes case aesthetics to the next level. In 
lieu of a traditional side panel, Snowblind 
has a semi-transparent LCD screen that can 
display everything from dynamic graphics 
to real-time hardware monitoring widgets.
The case‚Äôs side panel is a 1280x1024 
LCD screen that uses the internal lighting 
of the case for backlighting. It connects to 
your GPU via a short DVI cable, so Windows 
recognizes it as a second (or third, or fourth) 
monitor that you can set to display widgets, 
graphics, or whatever you want. My favorite 
was leaving the panel mostly transparent‚Äî
showing off the manicured insides‚Äîsave for 
a handful of Rainmeter widgets displaying 
CPU usage, GPU load, and time.
Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt buy Snowblind 
as a standalone case‚Äînot yet, at least. At 
launch, it‚Äôs only available as a full, pre-built 
system from iBuyPower, starting at $1,549 
for an Intel Core i5-7400, 8GB 
of RAM, a GeForce GTX 
1070 GPU, and 
1TB of storage.

comes soon‚ÄîI 
want to build 
inside one.

Aggregating Problems
Thanks for the great article 
in the Spring issue about 
boosting my NAS with link 
aggregation. And timely, 
too. I had just run Ethernet 
cable up to my second floor 
to serve another PC and 
a smart TV up there, and 
was looking into utilizing 
both ports on my QNAP 
TS-251, since two or three 
devices may be accessing 
it at a time now. I use my 
NAS for media streaming 
and computer backups. 
Since I hadn‚Äôt purchased a 
switch yet, I just picked up 
the same switch you used 
(TP-Link SG-2008). I was 
able to follow your tutorial to 
the letter. It was spot on, but 
one tip, though, for anyone 
using this particular switch: 
After setting up LACP 
and verifying everything 
works, you‚Äôll want to click 
‚ÄúSave Config‚Äù on the main 
menu, to make the changes 
permanent. Otherwise, if 
the switch loses power, it 
reverts to factory defaults, 
and you lose your settings. 
I found that out the hard 
way when I decided to move 
the switch to a new location 
after setting it up!
I‚Äôm semi-comfortable 
with networking, but I‚Äôm far 
from an expert, and I had 
one hell of a time getting 
things to work initially. I 
have a cable modem and 
wireless router (D-Link 
DIR-868L). I couldn‚Äôt log 
on to the switch unless I 
removed the router from 
the network. I was able to 
do that and get LACP set up 
just fine, but once I hooked 
the router back up: no switch 
access again. The QNAP 
console confirms both ports 
are trunked, though.
I assume I may have an 
IP address conflict. I ran 
across a neat little program 
called NetScan Tools Pro, 
which tells me more info 
about my network than 
I knew existed! It says 
there are no duplicate IP 
addresses, and I couldn‚Äôt 
decipher any other problems 
with the tests I ran. FWIW, 
my Windows 10 PC and 
my router are both using 
default network settings for 
the most part, except I set 
them both to use Google‚Äôs 
DNS servers. They‚Äôve been 
set up that way for a long 
time without issue. My cable 
modem is pretty well locked 
down, of course. My ISP 
charges $25 per month just 
to have a static IP address 
set on it. No thank you!
So, do you think I should 
just leave well enough alone, 
since everything seems to be 
working fine? Or is there a 
reasonably simple fix to get 
things set up right? I don‚Äôt 
want to go mucking around 
with a lot of network settings 
and screw something else 
up, but I don‚Äôt want any 
potential future problems 
either. Perhaps we could use 
a feature article on home 
networking one day soon?
‚ÄìScott Holcomb
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: I passed 
on your details to the author 
of the article, Nick Peers, 
and he responded with, 
‚ÄúThe switch defaults to 
192.168.0.1, which conflicts 
with many routers. You 
need to manually set the 
IP address of the switch 
to something else.‚Äù Nick 
followed up by saying he‚Äôll 
drop you a line directly, as 
it‚Äôs not easy. On to your last 
point: I think a feature on 
the optimal way of setting 
up your home network 
is a great idea, and it‚Äôs 
something you‚Äôll see in a 
forthcoming issue.

TWEAK WINDOWS 
FOR BETTER GAME 
PERFORMANCE
If you‚Äôve ever examined the 
task list after a Ctrl-Alt-Del 
command, you‚Äôve probably 
wondered whether all those 
background processes affect 
the gaming performance of 
your system. Even a clean, 
fresh Windows installation 
sprouts a lengthy list of 
apps, tasks, and services 
that runs to dozens of 
entries long.
The concept of pruning 
this process tree to increase 
performance isn‚Äôt new. 
Utilities claiming to do this 
have been around so long, 
the idea has made its way 
into Windows itself, as 
outlined in our look at Win 
10‚Äôs upcoming Game Mode.

‚ÄìHinton Thomas
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: Virtual 
private networking has 
traditionally been used by 
home workers to log on to 
their work‚Äôs intranets to get 
critical work done securely. 
This is still their main use 
today, although more and 
more we‚Äôre seeing VPNs 
used as a way of obfuscating 
network traffic to avoid geo-
restrictions and censorship. 
We‚Äôve looked at the process 
of setting up and running 
VPNs before (in fact, if you 
turn to page 68, you‚Äôll find 
a guide on how to turn your 
home PC into a VPN for 
accessing while you‚Äôre out 
and about), but we‚Äôve only 
ever touched on what VPNs 
are in passing. We‚Äôll look at

Discount Drive
I keep seeing in your builds 
that you always have decent-

‚ÄìEJ Cross
REVIEWS EDITOR ZAK 
STOREY RESPONDS: We use 
a combination of Newegg, 
Amazon, PC Part Picker, and 
NCIXUS. We generally avoid 
one-off, short-term sales, 
because the lead time on 
the magazine means that 
these can be out of date by 
the time you read it. So, you 
shouldn‚Äôt have a problem 
finding drives for the prices 
we quote. 
Virtual Revolution
With rumors circulating 
and people guessing, 
I‚Äôm one of them. Here‚Äôs 
my guess: Valve/HTC 
are working on the next 
iteration of Vive. If we see 
anything this year, I think 
it‚Äôs more likely it would be 
Iteration 1.5. Sort of a Tick, 
Tock, like Intel‚Äôs strategy 
has been in the past for 
optimizing its architecture. 
I think it is more likely (for 
development) that we see a 
full hardware update some 
time next year.
‚ÄìMatthew Sumrada
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF TUAN 
NGYUEN RESPONDS: HTC 
is said to be working on 
a completely untethered 
version of the Vive‚Äîthat 
is, one without having to 
use Lighthouses for 3D 
room-scale type movement. 
This is very much like what 
Oculus demoed to us during 
the last Oculus Connect 
event, a few months ago. 
Everyone is working on how 
to get the imagery from the 
desktop GPU over to the 
headset wirelessly. HTC is 
trying to work that out, but 
right now the wireless stuff 
is prone to interference 
and range issues, as well 
as latency. You cannot have 
latency when it comes to 
VR, or else you‚Äôll get sick 
immediately. HTC recently 
demoed an external 3D 
tracker module, but that is 
likely to be integrated into 
the headset on the next 
iteration of the Vive.

we were very excited about 
the potential offered up by 
this initiative, but once we

development, rather than 
the at-home hacking that 
typifies most Pi projects. 
Having said that, we‚Äôve just 
taken another look around 
(in response to your email), 
and there are a few more 
projects now. You can find

Sound System
When building computers 
for digital music production, 
optimizing for reduction of

that for gaming. I wish you

high-power music rigs. 
Digital music magazines 
tend to slide past the issues 
of the actual computer and

EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS:
We love a niche here on 
Maximum PC, but a monthly 
column may be taking things 
a bit too far. Even so, we‚Äôll 
investigate this topic and 
see what we can find out. 
Last year, I put together what I felt was an ‚Äúultimate build,‚Äù and 
decided this time I was going to do the wiring the right way.
For now, I‚Äôm running three AIOs‚Äîtwo EVGA hybrids for 
my Titan (XP)s, and one Kraken x62 (a hardline custom loop is 
in the works). The tubes were driving me nuts, and Googling 
didn‚Äôt uncover much.
I also happen to be an avid (though not always successful) 
weekend mechanic, and had just Ô¨Ånished a fuel injection 
conversion. I had a bunch of 3/8-inch double tube clamps in 
red anodized aluminum. They Ô¨Åt the AIO tubes perfectly. That, 
with a little anti-kink, and the tubes I‚Äôve been trying to hide now 
actually look good.
Just wanted to pass this along. I‚Äôve attached a picture of my 
build. The clamps I used are from Earl‚Äôs, and you can get them 
in any automotive enthusiast store (I got them from Summit 
Racing). And, yes, that‚Äôs an aluminum lower radiator hose on

NO MAJOR CHANGES THIS ISSUE for our mid-range system. We did swap 
out MSI‚Äôs Gaming M3 series motherboard for the SLI Pro, though, 
which comes in a slick black Ô¨Ånish, and with all the major features 
that its slightly more expensive brother offers. We also swapped out 
the EVGA GPU for a Zotac GTX 1070. 
Although Ryzen would probably be the best contender for this mid-
range build, the 5-series chips haven‚Äôt launched yet, and we‚Äôre still 
seeing teething problems in games with these chips and memory 
frequencies. Expect the bugs to be ironed out quickly, but for now, it‚Äôs 
a waiting game to see what effect AMD has on the industry.
Interestingly, the memory price hike has slowed, while spinning 
platters are still on the rise. We‚Äôre seeing small price increases 
across the board, bumping up our total, but thanks to swapping out 
the MSI Gaming M3, we can negate those rises, even if it‚Äôs only by $4.
IT FEELS ODD to say that Intel is currently the best budget option 
you can invest in, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less true. Intel‚Äôs 
aggressive single-core performance on the Pentium G4600 makes it 
a competitive gaming chip, capable of hanging with the best of them. 
And short of going with refurbed or second-hand parts, this system 
represents the best bang for buck for a casual desktop PC.
This issue has seen a few changes, though‚Äîamazingly, memory 
prices haven‚Äôt changed this month, but SSD prices have crept up, so 
we‚Äôve dropped the Z400s Sandisk for an Ultra II; it has a touch less 
storage, but is no less of a performance king than the Z400s. On top 
of that, we swapped out the G.Skill memory for a kit of Patriot Viper 
Elites instead, because it saved us a grand total of $5. The biggest 
conundrum was the Hitachi Deskstar, eating up our budget by 
another $8 compared to last month.

SEVERAL FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES this month, the biggest being 
the case. We decided to drop the Evolv ATX for another Phanteks 
beauty: the P400S Tempered Glass Silent Edition. Still touting a 
ridiculous amount of airÔ¨Çow, stunningly clean design, and a white 
aesthetic, this midi tower is more than capable of supporting all the 
hardware in our build, and also comes in at $80 cheaper than the Evolv. 
Next on the chopping block was the EVGA PSU. Although a great 
choice, we decided to go for Corsair‚Äôs RM850X, in case you want to opt 
for a custom sleeved cable kit from the likes of Corsair later on. We 
also took a long look at the price of graphics cards‚Äîthere are some 
great deals on GeForce GTX 1080s at the moment, but ultimately we 
decided to go with the newer 1080 Ti. We also switched to a single 5TB 
WD Black HDD, rather than last month‚Äôs two 2TB drives.
We swapped out the memory too, picking up HyperX‚Äôs Savage 2666 
kit, as we can verify that it works on this mobo, with this chip. Ryzen‚Äôs 
memory woes aren‚Äôt as debilitating as many people say, but they do 
exist. Higher frequency memory kits, although available, are limited in 
quantity. A predictable teething issue from AMD‚Äôs latest architecture. 
Our biggest change, of course, is the GPU. The GTX 1080 Ti is king of 
the hill when it comes to gaming performance right now‚Äîit overclocks 
like a champ, and makes 4K gaming genuinely enjoyable. However, if 
you want to save cash, a GTX 1080 offers just as good an experience.  
UPGRADE OF 
THE MONTH
There‚Äôs nothing like a piece 
of maximum whoop-ass in 
GPU form, and that‚Äôs exactly 
what you get with the GTX 
1080 Ti. Despite Nvidia‚Äôs own 
price gouging for the last year 
or so, the GTX 1080 Ti offers 
unprecedented 
performance 
at a price that‚Äôs just too good 
to pass up. Combine that with 
an immense amount of fun in 
the overclocking department, 
plus fantastic 4K and 1440p 
performance, and it quickly 
wraps up to make this one 
of the most interesting GPU 
launches of the last two years: 
A Titan X at a GTX 1080 price. Not only that, but it has also 
forced the rest of Nvidia‚Äôs 10 series line-up to move down the 
price chain to something a lot more reasonable.
