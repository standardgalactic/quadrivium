Digital Photography Just the Steps For Dummies, 2nd Edition

W
elcome to the exciting world of digital photography! Whether
digital photography is a new interest of yours or it’s your pas-
sion, Digital Photography Just the Steps For Dummies has something just
for you.
About This Book
This book is for those of you who don’t want fluff — just the informa-
tion to get your answers and go back to shooting or editing your pho-
tos. The book wasn’t written in a linear format, but completing one
chapter before you begin another can be helpful. Don’t worry: I let you
know when that’s the case. When you need an explanation or want to
get something done, follow these simple steps:
1.
Pick the task. Check out the table of contents or the index to find
what you’re looking for.
2.
Find it fast. This step is easy because tasks are grouped logically
into parts and chapters. 
3.
Get it done. Follow the steps, look at the figures, and move on to
the next task. No fear, no fuss.
Why You Need This Book
Digital Photography Just the Steps For Dummies gives you just what you
want — and nothing more. Why wade through dry user manuals
(unless it’s absolutely necessary) and 800-plus-page books when all you
want is a quick answer to your question or a snappy solution to your
problem? Direct steps and figures are all you need, leaving you precious
time to go out and use that digital camera.
Conventions used 
in this book
➟Menu commands use the ➪symbol. It tells
you to click your mouse on the menu com-
mand in front of the symbol and then, when
the menu choice behind the symbol appears,
click it: for example, File➪Save.
➟Web site addresses appear in a monospace
font to make them easy to identify. Type them
exactly as you see them: for example, www.
dummies.com.
➟Because the range of cameras and software is
so diverse, I give you only general instructions.
When your instructions may be different, 
consult your user manual.
Look for this icon throughout the text to
find helpful insights, explanations of dif-
ficult concepts, and ways to save time
and trouble.
➟
Introduction

This book takes you through the world of digital photography
from preparation to post production. You start out by examin-
ing equipment, proceed to discovering a little about photogra-
phy, and move on to composition and capture. From there,
you find out how to edit and improve those captured images
and then to organize, manage, and share your photos.
How This Book Is Organized
Digital Photography Just the Steps For Dummies is divided into
three parts.
Part I: Acquiring Digital Photos
This part starts out with brief information on equipment and
accessories and photography basics. From there, you find valu-
able information on composition and capturing specific types
of subjects. I round out this part by assisting you in getting
your photos from their original source, whether it’s your cam-
era or scanner or other means, onto your computer for editing
and storage.
Part II: Editing and Enhancing Digital Photos
Trying to capture the perfect image is an ideal worth striving
for, but in case you fall short, plenty of tools can help you edit
and enhance your photos in postproduction. A popular choice
is the inexpensive yet powerful Adobe Photoshop Elements,
which is the program I use for the steps in these chapters. If
you don’t have Elements, don’t worry: Many general concepts
covered in this part are universally applicable.
Part III: Managing and Sharing Your Photos
Don’t get caught with the digital version of the proverbial
shoebox overflowing with photos. Organizing and man-
aging your photos isn’t hard, or even that time consum-
ing, if you can embrace it from the get-go and implement
it as part of your digital photo workflow.
After you clean up and organize your images, what good
are they sitting on your hard drive? Get them out into the
world! Share your photos with friends and family in a
variety of ways — online sharing sites, CDs, photo books,
PDF slide shows, and prints, for example.
Get Ready To . . .
Look over the table of contents or index to find an
answer to a burning question about digital photography.
If you don’t have one yet, get out and shoot! I’ll be here
waiting for you if you need me when you return.

Purchasing a
Camera and
Accessories
K
eeping up with technology is a never-ending story. Just when you
think you have a decent handle on it, a new and improved product
hits the streets. No worries: Really, the best way to determine which
kind of camera you should buy is to first determine your needs. Ask
yourself the vital questions listed in the first section of this chapter.
What’s your budget? How often will you use the camera? What kind of
photos will you mostly be taking? And so on. After you determine your
needs, take your time researching and then shopping for the right
choice. Talk to people, read reviews, and even take a couple models for
a test drive. You want to make sure that the investment you make yields
the camera that best suits your needs.
Obviously, if you’re already a proud and satisfied camera owner, you
can skip this chapter and dive right into the topic of your interest.

Determine Your Needs
Before you start looking at cameras, ask yourself these important
questions to determine your needs:
1.
How much money is in my budget?
2.
How often will I use my camera? Will I take occasional
family photos or become a proficient amateur 
photographer?
3.
What kind of photography am I interested in? Will I
shoot landscapes, portraits, my child’s soccer games, and
other fast-moving subjects?
4.
What kind of lighting will I typically work with — 
outdoors, indoors, or both? What about weather 
conditions?
5.
Which is the most critical criteria — portability (when
you need it small, like the camera shown in Figure 1-4)
or feature rich?
6.
Will I print photos, and will I want to print large photos?
7.
Can I use my existing equipment, which makes compat-
ibility important?
8.
Am I willing to learn a little about photography so that
I can use a more manual mode?
If possible, test a camera before plunking down your hard-earned
dollars. Some camera stores rent cameras for a daily fee. If you
happen to have a friend or family member with a digital camera
you’re interested in, that’s all the better. Also, make sure to talk to
people who have digital cameras and read reviews in magazines
and on Web sites like www.dpreview.com.

In any discussion about using lenses with DSLR cameras you must con-
sider the complex concept of the crop factor. Crop factor is a ratio used
to compensate for the fact that digital image sensors are smaller than
the 35mm film frame. Therefore, if you take a photo with the same lens
on a digital camera and a film camera, the digital camera shows a
smaller area of the image. And, when you use a lens on a camera with
a smaller sensor, the lens has a larger equivalent size. For example, a
50mm lens on a camera with a crop factor of 1.6 creates an equivalent
lens of 80mm.

Understanding
Camera Basics
You have the camera, and you have the motivation. You may even
have a few shots under your belt. Now you’re ready to understand
a few basic concepts about photography and how your camera works.
This chapter gives you a brief rundown on exposure, aperture, shutter
speed, ISO, and a few key photographic terms. Because of differences
between camera makes and models, some setting names and locations
may be different from what you find here. Be sure to have your camera’s
user manual handy, and remember that nothing beats getting out there
and putting your camera through the ringer. Try every setting, get a shot,
and see what happens: That’s really the only way to truly feel comfort-
able with your camera. After you do all that, if you still want to go back
to the comfort zone of Auto mode, go for it.

Chapter

Understand Exposure
1.
Exposure refers to the amount of light allowed to fall on
the image sensor in the camera during image capture.
2.
Note the interrelationship between ISO, aperture, and
shutter speed in regard to exposure: Exposure is the result
of the combination of the “speed” of your image sensor
(ISO), the length of time that the image sensor receives
light (shutter speed), and the size of the lens opening
(aperture). See details on each setting later in this 
chapter.
3.
Changing one of these three settings causes one or more
of the other settings to change in an attempt to properly
expose the image. For example, if you change the ISO,
the aperture and shutter speed change to capture the
shot at the same exposure. If you increase the speed of
the shutter, the aperture or ISO also changes. The same
concept applies to changing the aperture. Manually, for
example, you can produce the same exposure if you
increase the size of the aperture, decrease the shutter
speed, and keep the ISO constant.
4.
The terms overexposed and underexposed refer to images
captured with too much light and not enough light
respectively, as shown in Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-1: An overexposed image
Figure 2-2: An underexposed image
➟

Chapter 2: Understanding Camera Basics

Set the Shutter Speed
1.
To set the shutter speed, you must be in either Manual
mode (M on the Mode menu or dial) or Shutter Priority
mode (S, or Tv, as in time value) on the Mode menu or
dial. Setting your camera to Shutter Priority mode
enables you to manually set the shutter speed while the
camera determines all other settings. See Chapter 3 for
more information on this mode.
Shutter speed is the length of time the shutter remains open and
the image sensor captures the photo. In automatic modes, your
camera determines the shutter speed.
2.
Set the shutter speed by turning the dial (located on the
front or top) and looking at the LCD display. If you
can’t locate the dial, check your camera’s user manual.
3.
Shutter speeds are measured in fractions of seconds to
seconds and usually range from 30 seconds to 1⁄4000, or
sometimes 1⁄8000, of a second. Some cameras also have B
(Bulb) mode, which enables you to keep the shutter open
as long as you hold down the button (in Manual mode).
4.
A shutter speed of 1⁄125 is a good overall setting to use.
For speeds slower than 1⁄60 of a second, you should use a
tripod or monopod to avoid camera shake and to
ensure a sharp image. If you don’t have a tripod and
your camera has an image-stabilization feature, be sure
to turn it on.
5.
To intentionally blur an image with a moving subject
(motion blur), as shown in Figure 2-3, set the shutter
speed to a slower speed. To freeze the action in a shot,
as shown in Figure 2-4, use a faster speed.
6.
When using longer lenses, you may need to increase the
shutter speed to keep photos sharp. As a guideline, use a
speed that’s larger than the lens focal length. For a
55mm lens, anything over 1⁄60 is acceptable, and so on.

Set the Shutter Speed

Know about Aperture
1.
To set the aperture, your camera must be in either
Manual mode (M on the Mode menu or dial) or
Aperture Priority mode (A or Av, which stands for aper-
ture value) on the Mode menu or dial. Setting your
camera to Aperture Priority mode enables you to manu-
ally set the aperture while the camera determines all
other settings. See Chapter 3 for more on this mode.
2.
Set the aperture by turning the dial (located on the front
or top) and looking at the LCD display. If you can’t
locate the dial, check your camera’s user manual.
3.
Changing your camera’s aperture can control the depth
of field (how much of the image is in focus). Basically,
set the aperture to a smaller opening (a higher number)
to gain greater depth of field, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Set the aperture to a larger opening (a smaller number)
to create a shallower depth of field, as shown in Figure
2-6. For more on depth of field, see Chapter 3.
Aperture, also known as an f-stop, refers to the size of the opening
in the lens of the camera when the image is captured. The size of
this opening determines how much light is allowed into the camera.
The larger the f-stop, the smaller the opening. Therefore, f/22 is a
much smaller opening than f/2.8.
See “Understand Exposure,” earlier in this chapter, to find out
about the interrelationship between shutter speed, aperture, and
ISO.

Chapter 2: Understanding Camera Basics

Understand ISO Settings
1.
Press the ISO button on your camera.
2.
Look at the ISO menu on your camera’s LCD. Set the
ISO speed. ISO speeds usually run at 50, 100, 200, 400,
800, 1600, or 3200.
3.
The lower the number, the less sensitive your image sen-
sor is to light. This results in a photo with very fine
grain, as shown in Figure 2-7. An ISO setting of 100 is
considered average, but a low ISO speed may not work
in low-light scenarios. Normally, you want the lowest
ISO setting possible for best quality, unless you want a
grainy shot for creative reasons.
4.
A high ISO number makes your image sensor more sen-
sitive to light and creates a grainy, noisy image, as
shown in Figure 2-8. High ISO settings may be neces-
sary in low-light situations, especially when using a
faster shutter speed or a smaller aperture, or both — for
example, when shooting a moving subject inside.
5.
ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are interrelated in
regard to exposure. When you change the ISO, the aper-
ture and shutter speed change as well to capture the
shot at the same exposure. For example, changing the
ISO from 100 to 800 causes the aperture to decrease and
the shutter speed to increase.
6.
In automatic modes, your camera “chooses” an ISO setting,
according to the lighting in the shot, unless you override it.
In film photography, ISO is an indication of how sensitive the film
is to light. It’s also referred to as film speed. In digital photography
it’s an indication of how sensitive the image sensor is.
Keep in mind that a tripod can help you capture a sharp image in
low-light conditions, thereby enabling you to avoid a higher ISO
speed.

Understand ISO Settings

Use Exposure Compensation
1.
Ensure that your camera is set to any mode except
Manual (M) mode.
2.
Press the shutter button halfway. Check the exposure
indicator on your camera’s LCD. It shows the shutter
speed and aperture setting.
3.
Specify your exposure compensation (EV compensa-
tion). Press the Av +/– button and turn the dial on your
camera. Positive amounts increase exposure (lighten),
and negative amounts decrease exposure (darken), as
shown in Figure 2-9.
4.
To set the EV compensation back to neutral, turn the
dial until the setting goes back to the center, or 0, of the
scale.
Exposure compensation is an adjustment you can make to slightly
alter the exposure setting established by the camera. This adjust-
ment, which enables you to slightly over- or underexpose your
photo, can come in handy when shooting a dark object against a
bright background or in backlit situations.

Set Image Quality
1.
Your camera may enable you to set image quality. On the
menu, locate the Quality setting on the LCD. Press Set.
2.
Use the arrow buttons to toggle through the Quality menu
and choose a setting, as shown in Figure 2-10. Press Set.
3.
Here’s a brief description of some typical image-quality
settings, based on an 8-megapixel DSLR (digital single-
lens reflex) camera:
• JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): A file
format and method of compression for digital
images. JPEGs create small file sizes because of exten-
sive compression. On the downside, the compression
is lossy and can degrade images after repeated saves.
• TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): A file format often
intended for printed output. File sizes are large.
• RAW: A file format that captures data from the cam-
era’s sensor. It’s considered the closest thing to a digital
“negative.” All processing is done after the image cap-
ture in an image-editing program. File sizes are large.
• Small: Adequate for 5 x 7 prints.
• Medium: Adequate for 8 x 10 prints.
• Large: Adequate for 11 x 17 prints. (Note that RAW
images accommodate this size.)
• Fine: Produces the best quality but less compression —
and, therefore very large file sizes.
• Normal: Produces better compression but lesser
quality — and, therefore, smaller file sizes.
Figure 2-10: Choose a setting from the image quality menu
On some cameras, you can shoot both RAW and JPEG simultaneously,
thereby giving you more options in postprocessing. Just be sure to have
plenty of large capacity memory cards on hand.
➟

Set Image Quality

Set White Balance
1.
Press the WB (White Balance) button on your camera. If
you cannot locate the button, check your camera’s user
manual. Note that your camera must be in Manual (M)
mode.
The white balance setting attempts to compensate for differences in
the color temperature of the lighting conditions, thereby minimizing
unwanted color casts. For example, twilight or snowy environments
have a cool, blue light. Sunset or candlelit environments have a
warm, yellow light. Fluorescent lighting has a green, cool quality.
2.
Look at the White Balance menu on your camera’s LCD
and specify a setting using the arrow buttons. Press Set.
3.
Here’s a brief description of typical white balance settings:
• Daylight or Sunny: For capturing images in bright
outdoor light.
• Shade: For photographing in shady areas.
• Cloudy: For shooting on overcast days.
• Fluorescent: For shooting under fluorescent lights
(tubular bulbs) often found in offices, schools, and
other commercial buildings. Figure 2-11 shows an
image shot on the Auto setting and then on
Fluorescent.
• Tungsten: For photographing under incandescent
(regular household bulb) lighting.
• Flash: For shooting with a flash.
• Custom: For shooting white objects (such as a white
card purchased at the camera store), which serves as
the reference for the white-balance setting.
Figure 2-11: An image shot on the Auto setting and then Fluorescent.
In automatic modes, the white balance is set automatically. However, if
your images are showing a color cast, you may need to adjust the white
balance manually. You can also use filters to mimic certain lighting con-
ditions. If you cannot do it “in camera,” you can do it in postproduction
in Photoshop Elements or another digital imaging program. See
“Remove Color Casts,” in Chapter 8.
When shooting RAW images, you custom-adjust the white balance in
your digital imaging program.

Chapter 2: Understanding Camera Basics

Nail Your Focus
1.
Set your camera to autofocus (using the AF mode switch
or button), which enables the camera to make all focus-
ing decisions. If your camera also has various autofocus
options, choose them from your LCD menu: for exam-
ple, One Shot (still subjects), AI Servo or Continuous
(moving subjects), or AI Focus (automatically switches
from One Shot to Servo). Compose your shot and press
the shutter button.
2.
Set your camera to Manual focus to put the focusing
control in your hands. Using the MF mode switch or
button. Also change the M/AF setting on the lens barrel.
Adjust the focusing ring on the lens of your camera.
Compose your shot and press the shutter button.
3.
When you want to shoot a subject off-center, as shown
in Figure 2-12, it may help to lock the focus. To do this,
set the autofocus option to One Shot AF mode. If your
camera has an option to select a single focus point or
AF, select it. (Check your camera’s user manual to find
out how.) Focus on your subject. Press the shutter but-
ton halfway down. Recompose your shot with the shut-
ter button still pressed. Finally, press the shutter button
the rest of the way.
Locking the focus can also help when shooting two people in the
center of the frame. If you don’t lock the focus, sometimes the cou-
ple is out of focus while whatever is between them looks as sharp
as a tack. New, higher-end cameras are being outfitted with face-
recognition capability to avoid this snafu.

Nail Your Focus

Use the Zoom Feature
1.
Focus on your subject and press the Zoom button until
you achieve the framing you want.
2.
Compose your shot and press the shutter button.
3.
If your camera has an image-stabilization feature, be
sure that it’s activated, to help eliminate camera shake
and the resulting image blur.
4.
Keep in mind that zooming in with an optical zoom
shortens the depth of field and causes the background
to become blurrier, as shown in Figure 2-13. Make sure
that this effect is what you want.
Lenses with optical zooms are “real” zoom lenses. The lens brings
the subject closer. Digital zooms aren’t really zooms: They simply
enlarge the center of the scene in the camera and crop out the rest,
and they can degrade image resolution and quality. If quality is
paramount, you may want to avoid employing a digital zoom. You
may have to disable the digital zoom by using a menu option or
avoid pressing the zoom past the optical maximum setting.

Match Your Meter to Your
Environment
1.
Put your camera in Manual (M) mode and press the
Metering button (an eye icon or check your camera’s
user manual).
2.
Select a metering mode from the LCD menu:
• Matrix, multi-segment, multi-zone, or evaluative
metering: Bases exposure on the entire frame, or on
all zones, as shown in Figure 2-14. This overall set-
ting looks at the subject’s position and brightness,
foreground, middle ground, and background light-
ing; averages them; and then determines the appro-
priate exposure.
• Spot, or partial, metering: Bases exposure on the
light in the center of the frame (approximately 9 to
10 percent of the frame). This metering mode works
well for backlit scenes, where the background is
much brighter than the subject.
• Center-weighted metering: Weights, or favors, the
center and then averages the entire scene. This mode
is also good for complex lighting situations.
All DSLRs and many point-and-shoot cameras have various meter-
ing modes. These modes define the way the image sensor in the
camera measures the light in the shot and then calculates the
appropriate exposure for the image.

Use EXIF Data
1.
If your camera is capable of displaying EXIF data, press
the Info button while in Preview mode to view the data
in the camera’s LCD.
2.
You can view EXIF data on your computer by right-
clicking an image and choosing Properties (in Windows)
or Get Info (on a Mac) from the context menu.
3.
You can also view EXIF data in most image-editing pro-
grams, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements (shown in
Figure 2-15), Aperture, iPhoto, Lightroom, and others.
4.
EXIF data includes the camera’s make and model , the
date and time, image dimensions and resolution, shut-
ter speed, and the aperture, ISO, and lens settings.
EXIF, which stands for Exchangeable Image File and refers to the
information that’s embedded into your image data when you take
a digital photo. This information can be valuable in determining
what went right and wrong in your shots, especially in bracketing
situations. (See Chapter 3 for more information.)

Chapter 2: Understanding Camera Basics

Taking Digital
Pictures
A
fter you buy the equipment and understand the basic concepts of
how an image is captured (see Chapter 2), it’s time to start shoot-
ing some photos. Don’t worry initially about ensuring perfect composi-
tion (see Chapter 4) or capturing your subject by using the
recommended techniques (see Chapter 5). Your most important task at
this stage is to get to know your camera. See how it works and become
comfortable with the basic principles of capturing an image. You may
never want to leave the warm, comfy confines of Automatic mode —
that’s fine. But then again, you may get a wild hair one day and wonder
what lies in the world of Manual mode. 
Because so many makes and models of cameras are available, I can’t go
into detail on every particular mode or setting. This chapter simply gives
you a few pointers on using a couple of useful and inexpensive acces-
sories, using both natural and artificial light and working with elements
like aperture and depth of field. Remember that you have no film to
process, so get out there and push those buttons.

Use Filters
1.
For digital cameras, these types of filters can be beneficial:
• Polarizing filters help reduce unwanted reflections
from water and glass. They also help to increase con-
trast and color saturation. This type of filter is espe-
cially helpful when shooting landscapes, where they
create bluer, darker skies. Be sure to use a circular
polarizing filter.
• Ultraviolet (UV) filters protect expensive lenses.
Although UV filters can benefit landscape shots by
adding clarity to hazy images, some photographers rec-
ommend that you avoid using it with a digital camera.
• Neutral density (ND) filters, shown in Figure 3-1,
reduce light in all wavelengths, so you can use slower
shutter speeds or wider apertures. ND filters can come
in handy when shooting subjects in bright light where
you want a motion blur, as in waterfalls or river rapids.
• Graduated neutral density (GND) filters help you
obtain a wider dynamic range, by gaining detail in
highlight and shadow areas — especially useful in
landscapes with a bright sky and a dark ground.
• Infrared (IR) filters allow only infrared light to pass
thorough the lens, creating beautiful glowing images
with dark skies and bright white foliage.
• Special effects filters that create starbursts and other
special effects can be fun to use.
2.
Make sure that the filter you purchase is of good quality
(Hoya and Tiffen make good ones) and fits the size of
your lens. Also, your camera must be capable of mount-
ing a filter. Depending on your camera model, you may
also need to purchase an add-on adapter. Be sure that
the filter you purchase is multicoated, to prevent
unwanted reflections. For more on lenses, see Chapter 1.
Figure 3-1: A UV and ND filter
Sometimes, using a filter can cause nasty occurrences, like lens flare and
vignetting (darkening around the edges). If this happens, remove the
filter and reshoot. Avoid using a polarizing filter on a wide-angle lens.
The filter causes the color of the sky to be strangely uneven.
For digital cameras, you can skip the warming, cooling, and fluorescent
conversion filters. You can alter the color of the light within your cam-
era, or in Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Photoshop Elements later, by using
the White Balance controls.

Chapter 3: Taking Digital Pictures

Set Up a Tripod
1.
Attach your camera to the tripod, as shown in Figure
3-2. Many tripods come equipped with a quick-connect
plate that detaches from the tripod. If so, slide the foot
of your camera onto the plate and then attach the plate
to the head of the tripod.
2.
Establish the height of your tripod by adjusting the legs
and neck of the tripod. Be sure to lock the legs and neck
so that they don’t slip.
3.
Adjust the head of the tripod until you have the exact
angle you want for the camera.
4.
Look through the viewfinder or LED screen and check
the height and angle. Make any necessary adjustments.
5.
If you’re using a lens with an Image Stabilization or
Vibration Reduction setting, you may want to turn it off
when using a tripod (unless the lens also has a setting
for detecting tripods). These settings enable you to hold
a camera in low-light settings and decrease the inci-
dence of camera shake. When you use a tripod, however,
the setting can cause your photos to be blurry.
Tripods are especially vital for taking shots that require the shutter
speed to be slower, thereby helping to eliminate camera shake.
Slower shutter speeds, which enable you to use wider aperture set-
tings, are often used in low-light situations, such as bad weather,
sunsets, and nighttime. You will also want to use one when using a
telephoto lens.

If you can’t stand lugging around a tripod, try a monopod — it’s like a
tripod but with only one leg. A monopod is more portable and is easy to
set up and move around, and it takes up less space in tight locations or in
crowds.

Set Up a Tripod

Use Reflectors
1.
When shooting a photo of a person outdoors in harsh,
midday light, first position the person so that the sun
isn’t in their eyes. (This step also helps avoid squinting).
2.
Place a reflector under your subject’s face, but obviously
not in the photograph, as shown in Figure 3-3. This step
helps to reflect light under the chin, nose, and eyes and
fill in the harsh shadow areas. Look for even, flattering
lighting.
3.
When shooting a person, a pet, or an object, next to a
window indoors, place a reflector on the side away from
the window to help reflect light back to the shadow side
of the subject.
4.
Compose and take the photo. Review it and make any
necessary adjustments.
A reflector is a fabric screen, usually silver (whiter light) or gold
(warmer light), that you use to bounce the flash off to spread the
light wider and thereby soften its harshness. A reflector is also used
to add light to fill in shadows or dark areas. Pros also use umbrella
reflectors to direct their flash into. Reflectors come in all sizes and
can cost from $50 for a smaller one to more than $100 for a larger
version. A “poor man’s” reflector can consist of white foam core or
mat board either as is (uncovered) or covered with tinfoil.
Figure 3-3: Use a reflector to fill in shadow areas

Try bouncing the flash into a reflector to diffuse and soften the light
from the flash.
➟

Chapter 3: Taking Digital Pictures

Use Diffusers
1.
If your flash unit comes with a built-in diffuser, as
shown in Figure 3-4, simply slide or pop it over the face
of the flash.
2.
If you purchased an external diffuser, follow the instruc-
tions that came with the unit to install it over the flash
head.
3.
Compose and take your photo. Review it and make any
necessary adjustments.
The price of a diffuser ranges from $10 for a simple diffuser to use
with a pop-up flash to more than $100 for a more professional ver-
sion. You can make a diffuser from semitransparent Scotch tape,
white tissue paper, cellophane, thin plastic container lids, or any
other item that is semi-opaque and safely covers the flash head.
Figure 3-4: Use a diffuser to soften the flash
A scrim, another kind of diffuser, is a panel of translucent material on a
frame, which is placed between the light and your subject to soften
harsh light. A scrim can also be made fairly easily with PVC tubing and
cheap gauze or white nylon fabric.

When talking about light, remember to consider the direction, intensity,
and color of the light and the concept of natural-versus-artificial light.
Remember that a flash doesn’t help in landscape shots: Your subject
needs to be nearby to benefit from a flash. Also remember that a flash
increases the depth of field, which may or may not be a desirable effect.
➟
34
Chapter 3: Taking Digital Pictures
Light Your Subject
1.
When shooting outdoors, the best times of day are early
morning and late afternoon, when the light is softer and
the shadows are longer. For portraits, bright midday sun
causes ugly shadows on faces and squinty eyes. Move
your subject into shady areas instead or use a fill flash
to fill in the shadow areas. Keep in mind that overcast
days are especially useful for photographing people, as
shown in Figure 3-5.
2.
Be careful of shooting photos when the light source is
directly behind your subject (backlighting) — unless, of
course, you’re aiming for a dramatic silhouette look.
Your camera may adjust the light meter to the lighter
background and not to your subject, thereby creating an
overly dark foreground or subject. Using a fill flash can
help in this situation. You may also need to turn on the
flash manually.
3.
When shooting indoors, try positioning your subject
next to a window, that doesn’t have direct sunlight
streaming through.
4.
In low-light situations indoors, use your camera’s flash.
You can also add light inexpensively by using table
lamps or clip-on utility lights. Position the lights at a
45-degree angle to your subject, if possible.
5.
Make certain that the brightest light source isn’t directly
shining into the lens. This situation can cause lens flare, or
those nasty light circles or rainbow effects that mar images.
6.
Use diffusers, scrims, and reflectors when needed (see
the earlier sections of this chapter) to soften or add light.

Shoot in Auto Mode
1.
Set the Mode dial or button to A (Auto mode) as shown
in Figure 3-6. In Auto mode, your camera makes all
decisions about setting the focus, aperture, shutter
speed, ISO, and white balance and determines the need
for flash. You may also need to switch your DSLR lens
from A to Manual.
2.
Compose your shot in the viewfinder or LED screen.
3.
Press the shutter button halfway to give your camera a
moment to establish the shot.
4.
Press the shutter button the rest of way to capture the
image.
Another automatic mode is Portrait mode. Try this mode when the
primary subject of your shot is human. In this mode, your camera
specifies the aperture and shutter speed to optimize the result.
Portrait mode should also keep the background in focus (creating a
deep depth of field). In addition, if you have a red-eye reduction
flash, it should also kick in.
Shoot in Manual Mode
1.
Set the Mode dial or button to M (Manual mode) on
your camera, as shown in Figure 3-7. In Manual mode,
you must make all decisions about setting the focus,
aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and white balance and
determine the need for flash. See Chapter 2 for a brief
explanation of these settings. If you’re a novice in using
Manual mode, try it first in a casual situation that isn’t a
once-in-a-lifetime event.
2.
Compose your shot in the viewfinder or LED screen.

Take Close-Ups in Macro Mode
1.
Set the Mode dial or button to Macro (sometimes it’s a
flower icon) on your camera. Macro mode enables you
to shoot extremely close-up subjects, such as flowers,
insects (shown in Figure 3-8), and product details for
online auctions. Check your camera’s documentation to
find out the particular focusing distance that Macro
mode is capable of.
2.
Compose your shot in the viewfinder or LED screen.
Focusing in Macro mode can be tricky, so be sure that
the focal point you want is in focus; if it’s not, make the
necessary adjustments. In addition, macro photography
benefits from the use of a tripod. (See “Set Up a
Tripod,” earlier in this chapter).
3.
Press the shutter button halfway to give your camera a

4.
Press the shutter button the rest of way to capture the

Chapter 3: Taking Digital Pictures

Shoot in Aperture Priority Mode
1.
Set the Mode dial or button to Aperture Priority mode
(A or Av ) on your camera. This semiautomatic mode
enables you to choose your own aperture setting. The
camera then chooses all other settings, such as shutter
speed, focus, white balance, and ISO.
2.
Aperture Priority mode is especially useful when you’re
looking for a specific depth of field. Setting the aperture
to a large number creates a smaller opening (like f/16),
letting less light into the camera and resulting in a larger
depth of field. Setting the aperture to a small number
(like f/2.8) creates a larger opening, which lets in more
light and results in a shallower depth of field, resulting
in an out-of-focus background, as shown in Figure 3-9.
3.
Your camera’s shutter speed adjusts accordingly. With a
larger aperture (opening), your camera most likely auto-
matically chooses a slower shutter speed. Conversely,
with a smaller aperture, your camera chooses a faster
shutter speed.
4.
Press the shutter button halfway to give your camera a
moment to establish the shot.
5.
Press the shutter button the rest of way to capture the
image.
You can also choose Shutter Priority mode (S or Tv). Similar in con-
cept to Aperture Priority mode, this mode enables you to choose the
shutter speed while the camera chooses the remaining settings. This
mode can come in handy when shooting subjects in motion, from
sports shots to moving cars to rushing water. Depending on the
shutter speed you choose, you can “stop the action” or intentionally
create a blurred effect.

Bracket Your Exposures
1.
Set your camera to the Automatic Bracketing (AEB or
BKT) setting.
Bracketing occurs when you take several shots using different cam-
era settings, usually having to do with exposure. It’s usually done
in difficult lighting situations or with overly contrasting subject mat-
ter, to ensure that one of your captures yields a satisfactory image.
Bracketing can also be done with focus, white balance, and flash.
2.
Depending on your camera model, it automatically
takes multiple shots (often three to five) using different
settings. It should base the first shot on the setting that
the meter says is correct. It then takes one or two shots
overexposed and one or two shots underexposed from
that first setting, as shown in Figure 3-10.
3.
If your camera is in Burst or Continuous or Continuous
Drive mode, you need to press the shutter only once. If
your camera is in Single Shot mode, you have to press
the shutter three to five times. Check the details in your
camera’s manual to use AEB or BKT mode.
You can also manually bracket the exposure by physically changing
the settings on your camera.

Chapter 3: Taking Digital Pictures

Work with Depth of Field
1.
To create a shallow depth of field, as shown in Figure 3-11:
• Shoot in Portrait mode (look for the letter P or a head
icon), which sets the camera to a larger aperture.
• Set your camera to Aperture Priority (A or Av) mode.
(See the earlier section “Shoot in Aperture Priority
Mode.”) Choose a large aperture, which, ironically, is
indicated by a smaller number. For example, f/2.8 is a
larger aperture than f/16. Try various aperture settings
to create the depth of field you want.
• Use a telephoto lens and fill your frame with the sub-
ject. The longer the focal length of your lens, the
shallower the depth of field.
• Move close to your subject. The closer you are, the
shallower the depth of field.
2.
To create a deep depth of field, as shown in Figure 3-12:
• Shoot in Landscape mode (look for the mountain
icon), which sets the camera to a smaller aperture.
• Choose A or Av mode and a small aperture, such as
f/16 or f/22. Experiment with settings to create the
depth of field you want.
• Use a wide-angle lens to increase the impact of the
deep depth of field.
• Move farther away from your subject.
Depth of field refers to how much area is in focus in front and in
back of your subject. Use shallow depth of field to minimize (by
blurring) a busy, distracting background and make your subject a
stronger focal point. Use deep depth of field to keep a sharp focus
from the foreground to the background of your image.

3.
Copy the RAW images from your camera or card to your

Image to process it and open it in Elements. Click Done
to make the settings you established the new default set-
tings for your RAW image.
Figure 3-13: Process Camera RAW images
Camera RAW images are the closest thing to pure “digital negatives” as
you can get, which means that the camera doesn’t process the image
internally (unlike with JPEG or TIFF files). You must have software (such
as Adobe Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, or the camera’s proprietary
software) that can open and process the file after capture. In the
Camera RAW dialog box, you have controls to adjust the white balance,
exposure, and contrast. Although working with Camera RAW requires a
little more knowledge, it gives you the best image quality and maxi-
mum flexibility in image editing.
Some cameras can capture both RAW and JPEG photos simultaneously,
giving you the option of choosing either format. Just be sure to have
plenty of media cards on hand for storing all these files. RAW images
are very large.

Getting the 
Best Shot
T
he best camera, a great location, and some technical prowess all cer-
tainly contribute to the making of a good photograph. But other
elements must come into play as well. Knowledge of basic composition
is a key ingredient in the quality of a photograph, and there’s nothing
complex or difficult to remember. In fact, just employing a couple of
basic principles improves your photo-taking significantly. You’ll find, as
you take more photos, that these compositional concepts will start to
become second nature.
The other ingredient? Serendipity, of course, or just being in the right
place at the right time. Sometimes, there’s no discounting just plain ol’
good luck.

Find a Focal Point
1.
If a photo contains too many elements, the eye doesn’t
know where to look first. A focal point draws your viewer
to a main point of interest within the image. One of the
easiest compositional tasks is to find a clearly defined
focal point.
2.
To create a clear focal point, include only necessary ele-
ments that contribute to the compositional strength or
emotional value of your image:
• If you’re shooting people or animals, try to get close
to them.
• If you’re shooting scenes, find something interesting
to include in the frame, as shown in Figure 4-1. Shots
of mountains and beaches are fine, but how many
are truly memorable? But throw in a climber scaling
the mountain wall or a surfer wiping out on a wave
and you elevate the visual impact to another level.
Problems to avoid include too much background and random clut-
ter and bystanders.

Chapter 4: Getting the Best Shot

Compose with the Rule of Thirds
1.
Use the rule of thirds to position your chosen focal
point. If you divide an image into a grid of nine equal
segments, as shown in Figure 4-2, the elements that are
most pleasing to the eye and also most likely to be
noticed first are those located at a grid intersection.
2.
To apply the rule of thirds to various shots, consider
these examples:
• In a scenic shot: A low horizon creates a spacious
feeling, and a high horizon gives an intimate feeling.
• In a portrait: Try putting the face or eyes of the per-
son at an intersecting point.
3.
If you have an autofocus camera, lock the focus when
you’re moving from center because the autofocus sensor
locks on to whatever is in the center of the viewfinder.
Center your subject in the viewfinder, and apply slight
pressure to the shutter release button to lock the focus.
Then reposition your subject at an intersecting point
and take the photo.
Avoid Mergers
1.
Unless you’re going for a lowbrow, humorous shot, be
sensitive to poles, tree branches, and other objects grow-
ing out of people’s or animals’ bodies. Photographers
refer to these undesirable bodily extensions as mergers.
2.
Also be careful not to amputate body parts in your shot,
known as border mergers, as shown in Figure 4-3.

Avoid Mergers

Find Leading Lines
1.
Leading lines draw the eye into the picture, as shown in
Figure 4-4. They add dimension and depth and can be
actual lines or lines implied by the composition of ele-
ments.
2.
To compose photos with leading lines, look for ele-
ments such as roads, fences, rivers, and bridges.
Diagonal lines are dynamic. Curved lines are harmo-
nious. Horizontal lines are peaceful. Vertical lines are
active.
The best leading lines enter from the lower-left corner and end at
a point of interest — the ultimate payoff.
Use Framing
1.
A frame welcomes you to an image, adds depth, and 
creates a point of reference, as shown in Figure 4-5.
2.
To compose photos with frames, use foreground ele-
ments to frame your subjects. Elements such as tree
branches, windows, and doorways can frame wide or
long shots. Close-up shots can also be framed.
3.
Decide whether to keep your framing elements sharply
focused or soft. Depending on the shot, sometimes
sharply focused framing elements can distract from,
rather than enhance, the focal point.

Chapter 4: Getting the Best Shot

Shoot from Unexpected Angles
1.
Try to take photos from angles other than straight on at
five to six feet off the ground — the world of the average
snapshot. Changing your viewpoint can exaggerate the
size of the subject either larger or smaller; enhance the
mood of the shot; or make a dull shot more interesting,
as shown in Figure 4-6.
2.
Depending on your particular subject, try a bird’s-eye
view (above the subject) or a worm’s-eye view (below
it).
Create a Mood with Distance
1.
Getting close to your subject makes the image personal,
warm, and inviting. Avoid including excessive back-
ground elements, and intimately fill your frame with
your subject, especially when photographing people, as
shown in Figure 4-7.
Use eye contact when photographing people. Remember that chil-
dren, animals, and other height-challenged subjects aren’t at the
same eye level as adults. Try getting down on the ground, at their
level.
2.
On the other hand, just as shooting close can create a
feeling of intimacy, shooting a subject with a lot of
space around it can evoke a sense of loneliness or isola-
tion. It depends on your intended message.

Reduce Background Clutter
1.
Most people worry only about cutting off people’s heads
when they shoot. In actuality, most people include way
too many elements in their shots, distracting from the
focal point. Background clutter that adds nothing to the
value of your shot should be eliminated.
2.
To reduce unnecessary elements in your photo composi-
tions, here are a few tips:
• Get close. Fill your frame with your subject.
• Move your camera, yourself, or your subject. Try
shooting a vertical or diagonal shot if the subject war-
rants it. If moving your camera isn’t enough, move
around your subject and try unexpected angles. Look
for compositions that minimize or avoid distracting
elements around your subject, such as poles, wires,
fences, or bright lights.
• Include only complementary background elements.
If your background elements are interesting and give
context to your subject, include them, as shown in
Figure 4-8. These elements can include props, land-
marks, and natural components.
• Try blurring an unavoidable, undesirable background
by using a wider aperture (like f/4 rather than f/11 or
f/16) on your camera. This strategy makes the depth
of field shallower so that your subject is sharp but the
background isn’t. Keep in mind that some consumer
digital cameras use image sensors that are about one-
third the size of a 35mm frame, making the lens
close to the sensor, which increases the depth of
field. This type of sensor can make it hard to blur the
background. You can always blur the background by
applying a blur filter. See Chapter 11 for details on
applying filters.

Chapter 4: Getting the Best Shot

Look for Balance
1.
Create balance in an image through the arrangement or
placement of the elements in your image.
2.
Think of balance in regard to color, shapes, and contrast.
3.
Balance can be symmetrical (harmonious or formal) or
asymmetrical (dynamic or informal), as shown in 
Figure 4-9.
Keep the Horizon Straight
1.
When shooting horizons, keep them straight, as shown
in Figure 4-10. You don’t want it to appear that every-
thing in your image will run off one side.
2.
If your camera has a viewfinder screen with a built-in
grid for that purpose, be sure to use it.
3.
You can purchase a bubble-level accessory to let you

Keep the Horizon Straight

Use Contrast
1.
Mixing light with dark provides contrast, which in turn
creates impact, as shown in Figure 4-11.
2.
To highlight contrast in a photo composition, just be
sure that the high-contrast area of your image is also the
focal point, because that is where the eye looks first.
3.
In color images, contrast can also be achieved by using
complementary colors, such as red and green, yellow
and blue, and cyan and orange. Look for contrast in
both nature and your own setups.
Find the Light
1.
In addition to considering exposure (the amount of light
that enters the lens), you can think about light in sev-
eral ways, such as the direction, intensity, color, and
quality of light.
2.
To incorporate these characteristics of light into your
compositions, here are a few tips:
• Time: The best light for photographs is usually around
dawn or dusk. The light is warmer and softer, and the
shadows are longer and less harsh. Avoid midday light,
when the sun causes ugly shadows and squinting.
Shoot neon when the intensity of the neon lights is
the same as the outside light, not when it’s pitch black.
• Weather: Cloudy or overcast days can be excellent for
photographing, especially portraits. The light is soft
and diffused, as shown in Figure 4-12.
If you must take pictures at midday, diffuse light with a scrim or
reflector.

Chapter 4: Getting the Best Shot

• Direction: Photographing a subject with backlighting
(lighting that comes from behind) can produce a dra-
matic image, as shown in Figure 4-13. Light shining
diagonally, such as early morning or late afternoon,
creates softer and longer shadows. Avoid lens flare by
not having your brightest light source shine directly
into your lens.
• Color: The light at midday is white, the light at sun-
rise and sunset is orange and feels warm, and the
light in shaded areas and at twilight is blue and
appears cool.
• Creative: When possible, use lighting creatively to
lead the eye, create a mood, or evoke an emotion.
Look for compositions created with light illuminat-
ing or shadowing an object.
Watch Movement In and Out 
of Frames
1.
If your subject can move, whether it’s a car, a person, an
animal, or another object, leave more space in front of
it than behind it. You want to give your subject room to
move into the frame, as shown in Figure 4-14.
Otherwise, the viewer may get an uncomfortable feeling
of departure.
2.
Also, if a person or animal is looking out onto a scene,
make sure that you include some of that scene so that
the person or animal is given a point of view.

Watch Movement In and Out of Frames

Choose a Depth of Field
1.
When you can, try to include an element in the fore-
ground, middle ground, and background to create 
depth and a sense of scale. Of course it’s better if those
elements add meaning to the image, as shown in 
Figure 4-15.
2.
Use foreground elements to frame your subject and also
add perspective.
3.
Make sure to use a greater depth of field (areas of sharp-
ness in relation to your focal point) when shooting ele-
ments in all three distances.
Use Texture and Shapes
1.
Look for interesting textures to add definition and 
for lines and shapes to create interest, as shown in
Figure 4-16.
2.
Remember that textures and shapes are enhanced with
the use of light and shadow. They also come into play
even more when shooting black-and-white images.

Capturing Your
Subject
M
aybe you bought your camera for a specific mission. You’re travel-
ing on an exciting vacation to an exotic locale or you have a new
child or puppy or hobby or event coming into your life. Regardless of
the initial impetus that drove you to buy the camera, you most likely
want to capture much more than that subject later. Certain subjects
and circumstances call for slightly different techniques. In this chapter,
I brush the surface and give you a few tips to help you photograph cer-
tain subjects. If you skipped Chapter 4, you may want to give it a gander
before diving into this chapter. Most of the composition tips presented
there apply to whatever you’re trying to capture here and will make your
photograph that much stronger.
The beauty of digital photography is that you don’t have to worry about
the cost and time spent in film processing, so you can let your experi-
mental and creative juices flow and snap away without worry or guilt.
Just stock up on a few memory cards and delete the rejects when you
have a little time.

Take a Portrait
1.
If possible, shoot the person in a location where they feel
comfortable. Chat with the person and make them feel
more relaxed.
2.
Incorporating general rules about composition (see
Chapter 4), like getting in close and using the rule of
thirds, can help to make a great portrait. Try placing the
eyes along an intersecting grid line and reducing back-
ground clutter, unless it contributes to the shot in some
way (see Step 11). Note that many cameras have a
Portrait mode that keeps your subject in focus while
blurring the backround.
3.
Use direct eye contact for the highest level of intimacy
and engagement. If your subject is looking away from
the camera (which can add mystery), decide whether you
want to include space to show the person’s point of view.
4.
Try to capture an aspect of the person’s personality, as
shown in Figure 5-1, or tell a story.
5.
If the person is posing, try to grab some candid shots
when they’re not paying attention. If you’re posing the
person, have them turn slightly to the side, angle their
shoulders, and lean in slightly toward the camera.
6.
Shoot a variety of shots: close-ups, medium shots, and
even full body. Create a lot to choose from.
7.
Shoot outside in natural light at 45 degrees to the sun.
Overcast days create a soft, flattering light. Shooting right
before sunset creates a soft, warm light. Avoid harsh mid-
day sun at all costs. People squint and the sun causes
nasty shadows across the face. If you must shoot then,
use a fill flash, or reflector, to fill in those shadows.If
you’re shooting in Manual mode, check the camera’s
white balance setting for both outdoor and indoor shots.

➟
52
Chapter 5: Capturing Your Subject

8.
Place people near a window, at 45 degrees, when shoot-
ing inside. To light the shadowed side of the face, use a
reflector (see Chapter 3) or even a house lamp placed at
45 degrees. Remember that soft lighting is the key with
portraits. Make sure to set the white balance to indoors.
If you must use a flash, be sure to set red-eye reduction
mode.
9.
Keep a low ISO (100 to 200) to minimize noise. ISO
settings refer to how sensitive the image sensor is to
light. If you’re using a slow shutter, use a tripod to
ensure a sharp capture. If you’re shooting in Manual
mode and not using a tripod, set the shutter to around
ƒ 1⁄125.
10.
Selecting your camera’s Portrait setting keeps the person
in focus and the background out of focus. Some cam-
eras also have a Portrait/Landscape setting, which keeps
both in focus.
11.
When shooting kids, get down to their level, be patient,
and grab some candid shots.
12.
If you’re shooting two people centered in the frame, you
may have trouble getting them, and not the background,
in focus when using auto focus. Try focusing on one
person and locking it (press the shutter halfway). Then
reposition the camera on the couple and press the
shutter all the way.
13.
Try photographing an environmental portrait, where
you shoot a person in surroundings that speak to who
they are in regard to their profession, hobby, or personal
life, as shown in Figure 5-2. Include tools of the trade or
props when appropriate.
14.
If you’re shooting someone you don’t know — for
example, while on vacation — be sure to ask for the
person’s permission.

Take a Portrait

Get That Group Shot
1.
Sometimes, taking a great group shot is a matter of
serendipity. But usually it requires direction and setup
from the photographer. Don’t be afraid to play director
and tell people where and how to stand, sit, or position
themselves. Just be considerate of people’s time and
don’t make them wait too long.
2.
Find the best location and, if possible, use props such as
trees or other natural elements to arrange people.
3.
After you scout and set up the location, position people
in a variety of poses. Depending on the number of peo-
ple, having some sit and others stand can work well, as
shown in Figure 5-3. Stagger people in front and behind.
4.
Having people get close, tilting their heads toward each
other, and even touching one another often makes the
shot more intimate and engaging.
5.
If you have an especially large group of people or active
kids or pets, try to elicit a volunteer assistant to help
with the directing. Also, when shooting really large
groups, moving higher and shooting down on them
enables more people to squeeze into the frame.
6.
If you’re shooting a group of people engaged in a cer-
tain activity, bring elements of the location or activity
into the shot, as shown in Figure 5-4, to give the photos
context.
7.
Finally, after you set up the shot, try to get people to
relax. Use humor to get people to smile naturally. It’s
the next best thing to spontaneity.

Chapter 5: Capturing Your Subject

Capture Animals
1.
As with shooting children, move down to an animal’s
level. For an intimate photo, capture the animal close
and at eye level. If you physically can’t get close, con-
sider a zoom lens. Get your pet’s attention by holding a
treat or toy next to the camera.
2.
Try to photograph the animal in a location it likes so
that the animal is relaxed and comfortable. A location
that provides context adds to the ambience of the photo.
3.
Capture the animal’s personality and charm. Is your dog a
live wire? Is your cat the ultimate couch potato, as shown
in Figure 5-5? Whatever its personality, try to capture the
special trait that defines the pet. And, like portraits of peo-
ple, often the candid, rather than posed, shot is the best.
4.
Be careful of using a flash when shooting an animal. The
flash may make the animal uncomfortable and even scare
it. Try to capture the animal in natural light, if possible.
5.
If the animal you’re photographing has very dark or very
light fur, you may need to slightly underexpose or over-
expose, respectively, to retain detail in the fur.
6.
As when capturing athletes, you may need to shoot on
a fast shutter speed (check your camera’s Manual mode
capability) or in Sports mode, which selects a fast shut-
ter for you. Also consider Continuous, or Burst, mode if
your animal is quick. That way, you’re almost sure to
capture a photo you like.
Zoos offer their own set of challenges. Because the animals may not be
close to you, you may need a zoom or telephoto lens. A tripod comes
in handy as well. If you’re shooting through glass, find a clean spot and
get as close to the glass as you can. To eliminate reflections, a lens hood
can help. And, if it’s available, include some natural surroundings with
the animal to give the photo context, as shown in Figure 5-6.

Capture Animals

Capture Action or Sports
1.
Have a plan. Know in advance what kinds of shots you
want to get. Of course, being familiar with the sport
helps you determine which shots would be interesting
to capture.
2.
If possible, position yourself in the best locations to
capture the action. These locations may vary as the
game, activity, or time of day goes on. In general, keep
the sun at your back.
3.
If you can’t get close to the action, a telephoto zoom
lens is helpful. To capture a wide area of activity, add a
wide-angle zoom to your equipment.
A monopod (like a tripod, but with one leg) is extremely useful
when using long, heavy lenses. Why a monopod? Because it’s light-
weight and almost as steady a tripod, but it can be moved easily to
chase action subjects.
4.
Be in the right place at the right time, as shown in
Figure 5-7. Sometimes, timing is so critical that captur-
ing that excellent shot means pushing the shutter just
before the perfect moment. Take into account any shut-
ter lag your camera has.
5.
Be aware of the background and elements around your
focal point. Unless they add context, keep them simple
and nondistracting, as shown in Figure 5-7.
6.
For most sports, shoot at a fast shutter speed (at least
ƒ 1⁄500). Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode so that
if the light changes, the shutter speed stays the same and
the aperture adjusts accordingly. Your camera may also
have a Sports or Action mode setting.

Chapter 5: Capturing Your Subject

7.
When shooting in low light without a fast lens (f/2.8 or
so), try a higher ISO setting. Just be aware that it may
add noise to your images. Remember that some sports
also don’t allow you to use a flash.
8.
If players are on the move, give these settings and tech-
niques a try:
• Set your camera to continuous focus mode, which
better enables you to track a moving player.
• Try Manual Focus mode. Auto focus may be fine for
the subject you’re capturing, but becoming comfort-
able with manual focus can help you get a shot when
auto focus falls short.
• Keep the camera on the player and adjust the focus
continuously (called follow focus).
• Focus on the area you expect the action to move into
(the zone focus), as shown in Figure 5-8.
• Follow the action and press the shutter (at a slower
speed) while still moving the camera (panning). This
technique creates the illusion of movement in a
photo.
9.
If you’re trying to capture a sequence, set your camera to
Continuous Shooting mode, or rapid frame advance.
10.
Don’t forget shooting the preparation, the sidelines, the
crowd, the aftermath. Sometimes the most interesting
and poignant shots aren’t even of the action.

Capture Action or Sports

Shoot Landscapes
1.
Composition is the element that separates a memorable
landscape shot from a mundane one. Check out the
composition tips in Chapter 4, which explain how to
use a focal point, the rule of thirds, framing, and lead-
ing lines. You also find out basics about including a
foreground, middle ground, and background and shoot-
ing from different angles.
2.
To capture expansive vistas, a wide angle lens serves you
well. If you don’t have one, try capturing the scene in
several shots and stitch them together using the Adobe
Elements Panorama feature. Some cameras also come
with software to assist you in creating panoramas. See
Chapter 12 for tips and techniques.
3.
Go for the maximum depth of field (see Chapter 3).
Use a small aperture setting and a slower shutter speed.
Note that many cameras have a Landscape mode which
will set up your shot for maximum depth of field.
4.
Use a tripod and shutter release for the sharpest image.
5.
Keep a low ISO for noise-free images.
6.
Add people or animals to gain a sense of scale or con-
trast or even a point of interest, as shown in Figure 5-9.
7.
Take advantage of reflections if you’re shooting water.
8.
Shooting at dawn (and immediately afterward) and
dusk (and just before) give you soft, warm lighting, as
shown in Figure 5-10. Stormy skies make dramatic back-
drops. If you have a boring sky, try a polarizing filter for
added color and contrast or keep the horizon line high
to minimize the amount of sky in the shot.

Chapter 5: Capturing Your Subject

Take a Night Shot
1.
Shooting at night usually means shooting in low light,
so the camera aperture needs to stay open longer, which
requires a slow shutter speed and a longer exposure (ƒ 1⁄30
or longer), as shown in Figure 5-11. Use lenses capable
of at least f/2.8. If you want to use a faster shutter speed,
increase the ISO setting. Just keep in mind that the
higher the ISO, the more noise your image may contain.
Remember that a flash helps only if your subject is directly in
front of you.
2.
Many cameras have a Night mode setting. Try this set-
ting to see whether it yields good results. Also try
Manual mode. Sometimes, automatic settings don’t give
you the best images.
3.
Because you need a longer exposure, use a tripod to
keep your camera as still as possible. Use a cable release,
or self-timer, so that pressing the shutter button doesn’t
cause shakiness in your image.
4.
Experiment with auto focus and manual focus.
Sometimes auto focus doesn’t work optimally in low-
light environments.
5.
If you’re not sure which settings work best with your
camera, bracket your shots (see Chapter 3). Note which
settings you’re using for each shot so that, next time,
you’re familiar with what worked.
6.
Start shooting before dark. Try taking shots at dusk, or
soon after. Capturing neon is especially nice before it
gets really dark and a little natural light is left, as shown
in Figure 5-12.

Take a Night Shot

Shoot in Bad Weather
1.
Take advantage of bad weather’s creative benefits.
Clouds diffuse the light and eliminate harsh shadows,
making for nice landscapes and even portraits. Stormy
skies create dramatic backdrops for landscape shots (as
shown in Figure 5-13) or singular objects, such as trees
or barns. Rain enhances colors and adds texture and
reflections on surfaces. If the scene is gray, include a
spot of color. Dark objects and colors against white cre-
ate exaggerated contrast, as shown in Figure 5-14.
2.
In bad weather, there’s usually less light. Make sure that
your camera is capable of having a wide aperture or
longer shutter speed, or both. A tripod helps keep
images sharp, especially for longer exposures. A cable
release or self-timer can also be handy. In extremely
cold weather, keep a spare battery or two warm in your
pocket. Cold weather zaps battery life.
3.
Snow and fog may confuse your camera’s light meter, so
play it safe and bracket your shots (see Chapter 3). At
least, open your aperture one to two stops. For snowy
shots, watch the white balance. If your camera has Snow
mode, use it. Play with shutter speeds to capture falling
rain or snow.
4.
Protect your equipment. Keep your camera as dry as
possible. Keep a soft, scratch-free cloth to wipe off any
water. Going from extreme cold into a very warm envi-
ronment can cause condensation to form in your equip-
ment, so allow your equipment to warm up gradually
under your coat; then put it in a camera bag before
going into a warm room. Finally, make sure all your
equipment is totally dry before you put it away.

Shoot Food
1.
Take time to set up a pleasing arrangement. Think of
the food in terms of color, shape, texture, line, and so
on. If you have time and the food still looks good, set
up alternative arrangements also.
2.
Use simple props where appropriate to help “set the
stage” and give context to the food, as shown in
Figure 15-15. Think of your setup as a kind of still life.
3.
Shoot it quickly. Capturing food is all about getting the
shot before the food starts to deteriorate. You may want
to have two sets of whatever food you’re shooting. Use
one set as the “stand-in” for lighting and arrangement.
Then use the other set to act as the “real” model.
4.
Get close to the food and shoot at plate level or higher.
One technique that’s often used is to shoot with a
macro lens, focusing on one part of the dish and letting
the surrounding elements blur, as shown in Figure 5-16.
This technique provides a strong focal point while still
maintaining the context mentioned in Step 2. If you
don’t have a macro lens, check your camera to see if you
at least have a Macro mode, which optimizes your set-
tings for close ups.
Food stylists all have their secret tips in making food look great. You
hear stories about using shaving cream instead of whipped cream,
airbrushing food with paint and so on. A couple more appetizing tips
are to brush vegetable oil on food to make it glisten and of course
spraying water on bottles to make them look wet and cold.

Photograph a Wedding
1.
Be prepared with charged batteries, free memory cards, and
other equipment, like lenses and a tripod ready to rumble.
2.
Make a shot list. Know when special moments are
happening — arrivals, ring exchange, cake cutting,
the kiss. And, remember that sometimes the best shots
are the candid ones — the bride getting ready, the ring
bearer anxiously tossing around the pillow, or the bride
and groom goofing off, as shown in Figure 5-17.
3.
Scout out the best locations and vantage points for your
shot. But remember to stay out of the way of working
professionals and the views of the guests. Consider
being extra courteous and asking the professional for
permission to shoot while he is working.
4.
Shoot a few throwaway shots to test the lighting. Use a
flash only if it’s allowed. If it is, consider using a flash
diffuser to soften the light. If not, open the aperture to
a wide setting.
5.
Remember the relevant tips in Chapter 4, such as get-
ting in close, eliminating background clutter (as in
Figure 5-18), composing with the rule of thirds, shoot-
ing at angles, and finding the light.
6.
If you’re shooting a group of people, see the section

Note that this section heading isn’t “How to Be an Amateur Wedding
Photographer.” You can find lots of helpful books on that single
topic. This section just gives you a few tips on how to take some nice
photos at a family or friend’s wedding.
A recent trend in wedding photography is the “trash the dress” shot,

Shoot for Online Auctions
1.
Shoot your object against an uncluttered background to
draw attention to what you’re selling. If you can’t afford
a light box or shooting table, make one for around $10
(see http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/
how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html).
Or, at least use a solid-colored sheet, attractively draped
as a backdrop, as shown in Figure 5-19.
2.
Get close to your object to show pertinent details. When
doing so, put your camera in Macro mode, if possible.
3.
Take several shots from different angles. The more you
show, the more that interested bidders feel the object is
bid-worthy. If showing scale is important, put a penny or
ruler in one of the shots.
4.
If you’re inside and don’t have a light box or an inex-
pensive lighting kit, shoot next to a bright window. If
you still need more light, clamp a utility light in position;
shine it at a 45 degree angle to the object. Chapter 3
explains lighting in detail.
5.
Use a tripod to ensure that your images are sharp.
6.
Shoot large items, such as furniture, where they give a
sense of context. If you sell clothing, invest in a cheap
mannequin or dress form. When shooting jewelry, using
a light box is definitely the way to go (see Figure 5-20). 
7.
If necessary, crop, clean up, and adjust the color and
contrast in your image-editing program (see Chapters 7
and 8). Also, size the image for display on-screen. Check
the file specs on your auction site so that images load
properly and quickly. A few minutes spent prepping
your image pays off in the end.

Transferring Your
Images
B
efore you can share and enjoy your photos, you have to first put
them on your computer. You may have digital photos in your cam-
era or media cards. You may have some photos burned to CD or DVD,
and you may have printed some that now need to be scanned and
stored. You may even have a few tucked away in a cell phone. If you
don’t own an image-editing program, like Adobe Elements, you proba-
bly want to look around for a simple digital-asset-management program
to help you keep all those images organized and easy to find.
At first, managing your photos may not seem like a big deal. But after
you get the hang of using your camera (or you go on a killer vacation),
you’ll that find your photos start quickly multiplying into the digital
equivalent of an overflowing shoebox. And although, initially, transfer-
ring all your archived images into a management program is time con-
suming, after you’re done, you’ll have that relaxed feeling that comes
with being uber-organized.

Transfer Images from a Camera or
Card Reader to Your Computer
1.
Connect your camera or card reader to your computer
by using a USB cable. If your computer has a media card
slot, insert your card. If your camera has a docking sta-
tion, plug it into your computer and place your camera
in the dock.
2.
Choose from one of these options:
• If you installed software that came with your camera,
follow the steps accordingly.
• In Windows Vista, the computer detects the connec-
tion and, in the Autoplay dialog box, shown in
Figure 6-1, asks you what you want to do with your
images. The Import Pictures command imports your
images into the Windows Photo Gallery application.
The Open Device to View Files command launches
Window Explorer and displays your device (camera or
memory card). Select the camera folder containing
your images, select the ones you want, choose
Edit➪Copy to Folder, and choose a folder in which to
place them on your hard drive. Note that if you have
Elements installed, the Adobe Photo Downloader may
pop up. Just click Cancel if you don’t want to use it.
If Vista doesn’t recognize your camera, find it by choosing Start➪
Computer. Double-click the camera icon, shown in Figure 6-2, to see
your images. Select some images, choose Edit➪Copy to Folder, and
choose a destination folder.
• On a Mac, the computer sees your camera or reader
as another drive on your computer. Double-click the
icon and then the folder, and Option+drag the images
you want to keep to another folder on your desktop.
For extra insurance, keep your files on your storage media and burn a

Scan an Image
1.
In Elements, in Windows, launch the Organizer 
(you can also be in Full Edit mode) and select File➪
Get Photos and Videos➪From Scanner. On a Mac, in
Full Edit mode, choose File➪Import and select your
scanner.
2.
In Windows, select your particular scanner from the
Scanner drop-down menu in the Get Photos from
Scanner dialog box, shown in Figure 6-8.
3.
Click Browse (or Choose on a Mac) to select a destina-
tion for the scans.
4.
Select a file format from the Save As drop-down menu.
If you choose JPEG, select a Quality slider. The higher
the quality, the larger the file size. If you plan to edit the
scan, choose TIFF as the file format. JPEGs use lossy
compression and degrade after they’re repeatedly saved
in JPEG format.
5.
Click OK to open your scanner utility program (for
scanners with TWAIN drivers), as shown in Figure 6-9.
If you don’t have Adobe Elements, you can still scan an image (by
using your scanner’s utility program) and then save it to your hard
drive.

6.
Follow the instructions that came with your program.
For the most part, you probably specify the area you
want to scan and then select the output dimensions. Be
sure that the width and height are set properly for the
output size you want.
7.
You also most likely select a resolution for your specific
form of output. Use either of the following two resolu-
tions, as a general rule of thumb:
• 72 pixels per inch (ppi) for files you want to show
on the Web and on-screen.
• 300 ppi for files you want to print to your desktop
inkjet or laser printer or when sending files to offset
commercial printers.
8.
Your program may also offer controls for color
correction.
9.
Preview the scan. Most scanner utility programs support
previewing a scan before you scan the image.
10.
If you’re satisfied, click Scan, Acquire, OK, or a similar
command, depending on your particular scanner and
utility program.
11.
The scan opens in the Get Photos window in the
Organizer. Click the Back to All Photos button to view
your scan along with the other files in the Organizer
window.

In Elements, you can save time by scanning multiple images at one time.
Simply arrange them on your scanner and follow the preceding set
of steps. Then choose Image➪Divide Scans. Elements divides the
images into separate image windows. As an added bonus, they’re also
straightened.
➟

Scan an Image

Scan Negatives and Slides
1.
Make sure that your scanner can scan negatives and
slides. You can’t scan a negative or slide on a scanner
that’s capable of scanning only reflective art (prints and
papers, for example).
2.
Ensure that your negatives and slides are very clean. You
can purchase compressed air to eliminate run-of-the-
mill dust. For other types of grime, check with your
photo-processing store for the appropriate cleaning
fluid. Because negatives and slides are so small, every
dust speck is amplified when scanned.
3.
Scan at the highest optical resolution. Because slides are
so small, 1 ƒ 1⁄2 x 1 inch or so, you need to scan them at
a high enough resolution to compensate for enlarging
the dimensions. For more on resolution, see Chapter 7.
Remember: If you plan to print the scanned images, you
want a final resolution of around 300 ppi at your final
output dimension (4 x 6 or 8 x 10, for example).
4.
If your scanning software offers controls for color and
contrast correcting, use them to optimize your scan.
You can also correct and enhance scans in Elements
(see Chapters 7 and 8).
5.
Consider scanning color and grayscale images in the
Millions of Colors image mode. That way, you ensure
that the maximum tonal range is captured. You can
always convert images to grayscale using software such
as Elements (see Chapter 12).
6.
Save scanned images as TIFF files for optimum quality.
But remember that their file sizes can be large. If you
want to save them initially as JPEG files, be sure to save
them in TIFF or PSD format if you’re going to edit them.
Repeatedly opening, editing, and resaving JPEGs can
eventually degrade image quality because of the lossy
compression that’s used.
Whether or not you have a whiz-bang slide or negative scanner, scanning
is just plain time consuming. If time is precious, check out a scanning
service, like wwww.scancafe.com, as shown in Figure
6-10. Prices can be as low as 19 cents per negative or as little as $24 per
slide. Plus, you pay only for what you want to keep. The services can also
scan prints.

Quick-Editing
Your Images
You may be a great photographer with the ability to capture that
perfect shot every time. Or, you may be a mere mortal, like the
majority of us, and need a little help getting those images ready to 
display and share. Elements offers a wide range of help, from simple
one-click fixes to more manual, multi-step methods of refinement and
repair. Color shifts, crooked photos, too much background clutter,
overly dark shadows — none of these problems is more than a couple
minutes away from being fixed.
This chapter, along with Chapter 8, gives you a full set of editing tools
for almost any correction you need to tackle. But before you run off and
do just that, this chapter starts off by offering some important and fun-
damental information about editing your digital images. Getting your
work environment ready for editing, having a good grasp on the interre-
lationship between resolution and dimension, and understanding dif-
ferent image modes and file formats are vital in preparing your images
for their ultimate debut.

Prepare to Edit
1.
Keep your desktop color a neutral gray. For color correct-
ing, you don’t want colors and patterns behind or around
your images to influence the way you “see” those images.
2.
Keep the walls around your monitor as clutter free as
possible. Don’t display any wildly colored posters that
influence the way you see your images.
3.
Keep the lighting in your work area as consistent as
possible.
4.
Calibrate your monitor. Try to obtain a screen color as
neutral (gray) as possible. You want to standardize your
display so that your image-viewing experience is consis-
tent. Windows users can check out Adobe’s Gamma util-
ity, though it isn’t compatible with Vista. Mac users can
use Display Calibrator Assistant. If you’re serious about
image editing, consider a hardware-and-software calibra-
tion package, starting at $75. Check out www.color
vision.com and www.gretagmacbeth.com.
5.
Check your preference settings (choose Edit➪Preferences
on the PC or Elements➪Preferences on the Mac), as
shown in Figure 7-1. Preference settings help you to cus-
tomize certain behaviors of the program. The Elements
Help file gives good information on each setting.
6.
Establish your color settings (choose Edit➪Color
Settings), as shown in Figure 7-2. Using the appropriate
color settings helps you better manage color among all
your devices. See Chapter 15 for more on color settings.
7.
Test your production workflow. View your images in 
different Web browsers. Print images using different print
settings. Find out what works best and how to compen-
sate for any deficiencies in your equipment and methods.

Chapter 7: Quick-Editing Your Images

Choose Image Modes
1.
Image modes determine the number of colors in an
image. Before converting an image from RGB color to
another mode, perform all necessary editing. Only RGB
images can access all Elements tools and commands.
2.
Choose Image➪Mode. Select from one of the following
available image modes:
• Bitmap: Different from image pixels in the Bitmap
file format, in Bitmap mode they’re either black or
white. You must first convert a color image to
Grayscale before you can convert it to Bitmap mode.
After you choose Bitmap mode, select an output reso-
lution of 72 ppi (Web) or 300 dpi (print). Choose a
method from the Use drop-down list. Figure 7-3
shows the effect of three options: 50% Threshold,
Pattern Dither, and Diffusion Dither.
• Grayscale: Click OK when prompted to discard your
color information. This mode converts a color image
to a grayscale one, as shown in Figure 7-4. Grayscale
images contain 256 brightness levels or levels of gray.
For better ways to convert color to grayscale, see
Chapter 12.
• Indexed Color: Indexed Color mode supports 256 col-
ors or fewer (refer to Figure 7-4) but not layers. The GIF
file format uses this mode to prepare graphics for the
Web. First, select the Preview option. Choose options
for the palette, number of colors (if you want), trans-
parency, and dithering. It isn’t vital to know the defini-
tion of each setting. This mode is for on-screen images,
so simply view the Preview image and experiment.
• RGB Color: This mode is the default color mode for
Elements and digital photos. RGB Color images (refer
to Figure 7-4) can display up to 16.7 million colors.

Choose among File Formats
1.
Choose File➪Save As. Select from one of the following
available file formats:
• Photoshop (.psd, .pdd): The Elements native file for-
mat makes all editing tools and features available. It
supports layers, all image modes, and bit depths.
Photoshop files are suitable for high-resolution print-
ing. Compare this format with the TIFF format.
• BMP (.bmp, .rle, .dib): The Bitmap file format sup-
ports all image modes and all bit depths. This format
is used for system resource files, such as desktop
wallpaper.
• CompuServe GIF (.gif): A popular Web file format,
used mostly for graphics, such as logos, Web buttons,
small illustrations, and text. GIFs are small in size,
but support only Indexed Color mode (256 colors or
fewer). If color integrity is important for your Web
images, use the JPEG format instead.
• JPEG (.jpg): JPEG, which stands for Joint Photographic
Experts Group, is one of the most popular file formats.
JPEGs, which support RGB Color mode, are com-
pressed to reduce file size. The compression scheme
they use, however, is lossy and can degrade image qual-
ity if you repeatedly open and resave images. When
you select the JPEG format and click Save, a dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 7-5. Choose a Quality
value. The value 0 is the lowest quality but has the
highest compression (and smallest file size). The value
12 is the highest quality but has the lowest compres-
sion (and larger file size). JPEGs do not support layers.
Reserve JPEGs for images to be viewed on the Web and
for attaching to e-mail messages. For image prints, use
the Photoshop or TIFF file formats. If you must save an
image as a JPEG, edit it first and save the original as a
Photoshop file. Then save a copy as a JPEG.
Figure 7-5: JPEGs offer a range of quality and compression settings
➟

Chapter 7: Quick-Editing Your Images

• Photoshop PDF (.pdf): PDF stands for Portable
Document Format, and Adobe developed it for
exchanging files: Anyone with Acrobat Reader, a free
download from Adobe, can view PDF files. PDFs sup-
port layers and all image modes. They’re suitable for
printing and as downloadable documents hosted on
Web sites. In the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, specify
the Compression and Image Quality settings, as shown
in Figure 7-6. Choose High quality for print images,
and Low or Medium Low quality for Web images.
• Photo Creation Format (.pse): This format is used
to save multipage Elements projects to a single file
format.
• TIFF (.tif): TIFF, which stands for Tagged Image File
Format, supports layers and all image modes. When
you select this format and click Save, a dialog box
appears, where you specify various options. You can
compress these files in a variety of schemes, includ-
ing LZW and ZIP, which are lossless and therefore do
not degrade image quality. Select a byte order (PC or
Mac), and leave other options at their defaults. TIFF
is an excellent file format for use in illustration and
page-layout programs as well as in Microsoft Word.
TIFF images are suitable for high-resolution printing.
2. Click Save. If presented with an Options dialog box,
specify your settings. If you aren’t sure what to choose,
you probably can leave them at their default settings.
Click OK.

more colors than can be seen on your monitor. Be
certain that if you choose this workspace, your printer
can handle the colors. This setting is often used for
print images.
• Allow Me to Choose: Lets you choose between sRGB

Work with Resolution and Dimension
1.
In Full Edit mode, open an image.
2.
Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
3.
Examine the dimensions and resolution of your image.
Elements allows you to change the pixel dimensions,
physical dimensions, and resolution of an image in two
ways:
• Select the Resample Image option. You can change
the pixel dimensions or file size, physical dimen-
sions, and resolution. If you increase any of these
three options, Elements resamples the image, which
adds pixels and typically degrades image quality, as
shown in Figure 7-8, depending on the severity of
the requested resampling. Consequently, when you
delete pixels, you downsample. Downsampling is
okay when you do it to prepare high-resolution
images for viewing on the Web.
• Deselect the Resample Image option. You can’t
change the pixel dimensions or file size — only the
physical dimensions and resolution, which have an
inverse relationship. Increase the physical dimen-
sions, and the resolution decreases. Raise the resolu-
tion, and the physical dimensions decrease.
4.
Click OK to confirm your changes, or click Cancel to
close the dialog box.
A pixel (short for picture element) is the smallest component of a dig-
ital image. Each pixel resides in a specific grid and has only one color
value. The number of pixels determines an image’s resolution. If you
have 72 pixels across a linear inch (a 1-inch horizontal line), you
have 72 pixels per inch (ppi), a low resolution suitable for on-screen
viewing. If you have approximately 266 to 400 pixels per inch, your
image is considered high resolution and is suitable for printing.
Figure 7-8: Resampling can degrade image quality
Digital Vision
If you want to preserve the quality of an image when you resize it, be
sure to deselect the Resample Image box. This action prevents the image
from being resampled. When you increase the image resolution, its
dimensions decrease accordingly. Similarly, when you increase its dimen-
sions, the resolution decreases. The exception to this rule is when you
want to downsample higher-resolution images for display on the Web. If
so, feel free to select the Resample Image option and enter 72 ppi for
the resolution and whatever measurements you need for the image’s
dimension.

3.
In your image, drag around the portion you want to
retain. The crop marquee bounding box appears, and
the area outside the marquee box darkens to help you
to visually frame your image. Release the mouse button.
4.
To adjust the cropping marquee, drag any handle on the
bounding box, as shown in Figure 7-9. Move the mar-
quee box by positioning the mouse cursor inside the
box and dragging.
5.
Double-click inside the marquee to complete the crop
(see Figure 7-10). Press Esc to cancel.
If you move the cursor arrow just outside the corner of the marquee
box, the cursor changes to a curved arrow. Drag clockwise or coun-
terclockwise to rotate the image. Being able to rotate and crop your
image simultaneously can be handy when straightening an image.
Be careful when cropping you image. To keep your image at the same
dimensions and resolution while cropping out a significant portion,
Elements has to resample the file. You should always capture the image
you want when you take the photo. But if you want the luxury of crop-
ping later, take your photos at a high resolution. See Chapter 1 for more
information on camera-resolution settings.

2.
Choose Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel.
Many digital cameras can capture 16-bit images (often in RAW for-
mat), which contain more image data and, often, better highlight
and shadow areas. The bad news is that many Elements commands
and features, such as layers, aren’t available to 16-bit images.
Therefore, conversion may be necessary.
Divide Scanned Photos
1.
Open a file with multiple scanned images in either Full
Edit or Quick Fix mode, as shown in Figure 7-13.
2.
Choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos. Elements
divides the images and places each one in a separate
file, as shown in Figure 7-14.
To get the best results, make sure you have a clear separation
between your images on the scanning bed. If your images have a lot
of white areas in them, you may want to cover the images on the
scanning bed with a dark piece of paper.

Edit in Quick Fix Mode

Use the Auto Fixes
1.
In the Organizer, or in either Full Edit or Quick Fix
mode, choose Enhance from the menu bar and apply
one of the following options to your open image:
• Auto Smart Fix: Attempts to fix it all — lighting,
contrast (shadows and highlight details), and color
balance, as shown in Figure 7-19.
• Auto Levels: Adjusts the overall contrast of the image.
This command works by converting the lightest and
darkest pixels in your particular image to white and
black respectively. This makes the highlights lighter
and the shadows darker, thereby increasing contrast,
as shown in Figure 7-20. If you produce a strange
color cast (a shift in color) after you apply the com-
mand, choose Edit➪Undo and try instead the Auto
Contrast command or the Levels command
(described in Chapter 8).
Elements has a group of one-click automatic corrections that attempt
to fix your lighting, contrast, and color problems. Although the cor-
rections are a cinch to use, they may not give you the best results,
and you may ultimately have to use manual correction methods.
What the heck — give them a try! Note that with auto fixes, usu-
ally just one does the trick. If you not sure which one to use, just try
it. If it doesn’t work to your liking, choose Edit➪Undo and try
another one. You usually want to avoid applying multiple auto fixes
because you may make things worse than they already are. If none
of the auto fixes works, move on to the manual methods described
in Chapter 8.
Figure 7-19: Auto Smart Fix tries to fix it all — lighting, contrast, and color

Chapter 7: Quick-Editing Your Images

• Auto Contrast: Tries to fix the overall contrast with-
out adjusting the color. Contrast adjustments usually
aren’t as effective as the Auto Levels command, but
overall color balance is better maintained. Try this
command on hazy images, as shown in Figure 7-21.
• Auto Color Correction: Corrects both the color and
contrast of an image by analyzing the shadows, mid-
tones, and highlights and adjusting the darkest and
lightest areas. This command can come in handy in
removing a color cast, as shown in Figure 7-22.
• Auto Sharpen: Creates the illusion of improved focus
by increasing the contrast between pixels. Try not to
oversharpen or else you end up with grainy, noisy
images. Keep in mind that sharpening can’t improve
a blurry photo, just one with a slightly soft focus.
Sharpening should always be your last fix after you
make all other fixes. For more information on sharp-
ening, see Chapter 8.
• Auto Red Eye Fix: Automatically detects and elimi-
nates red-eye in images. If the Auto Red Eye Fix option
doesn’t fix your red-eye satisfactorily, use the Red Eye
Removal tool, described in Chapter 8.

Enhance with Cloning
1.
In Full Edit mode, select the Clone Stamp tool from the
Tools panel.
2.
Specify your options on the Options bar:
• Brush Preset: Choose a brush tip and size.
• Blend Mode: For most cloning, the Normal default set-
ting works well. Chapter 11 has more on blend modes.
• Opacity: Specify a transparency level or leave it at the
default setting of 100 percent.
• Aligned: Select this option to have the clone source
move as you move your cursor. To clone from the
same source repeatedly, leave this option deselected.
• All Layers: Select this option to sample pixels from all
visible layers. Otherwise, only the active layer is used.
3.
Press the Alt key (or press Option on the Mac) and click
the clone source (the area of the image you want to clone
from).
4.
Release the Alt key (or Option) and then click or drag
on the flawed area (the portion of the image where you
want the sampled, or cloned, pixels to appear), as
shown in Figure 7-23. When you click or drag, the
crosshair is the clone source, and the Clone Stamp
cursor is where the cloned pixels are applied. If you
select the Aligned option in Step 2, when you move the
mouse, the crosshair moves as well. Watch the crosshair
to avoid cloning something you don’t want.
This tool is helpful for repairing small flaws — scratches, bruises,
and dings — in otherwise perfect images. The Clone Stamp is also
an ideal tool to duplicate images with soft shadows, as shown in
Figure 7-24. Chapter 8 covers the healing tools—great for zapping
blemishes and wrinkles.
Try to be fairly light handed when cloning. If you overwork an area,
it ends up looking blotchy. Remember: you don’t want anyone to know
that an area has been retouched.

Tone with the Dodge and Burn Tools
1.
In Full Edit mode, choose either the Dodge or Burn tool
from the Tools panel.
Reserve dodging and burning for small areas only. To adjust the
overall tonal range in an image, use Auto Levels or a manual
adjustment, like Levels or Curves.
2.
Specify your options on the Options bar:
• Brush Preset: Choose a brush tip and size.
• Range: Select Shadows to darken or lighten the darker
areas of your image. Select Midtones to adjust the
middle tones. Select Highlights to make the light areas
lighter or darker.
• Exposure: Specify the amount of adjustment you
want to apply with each brush stroke by adjusting the
slider or entering a percentage. You should start with
a lower percentage, such as 10 percent.
• Airbrush: Select this option to convert your brush
into an airbrush. The longer you press down the
mouse button, the more “flow” of adjustment you
create.
3.
Brush over the areas you want to lighten or darken, as
shown in Figure 7-25. Take your time between each

• Flow: Specify the flow rate by adjusting the slider or
entering a percentage. The flow rate is the speed at
which the saturation or desaturation effect builds
while you brush over your image.
• Airbrush: Select this option to convert your brush
into an airbrush. As with a traditional airbrush, the
longer you press the mouse button, the more “flow”
of adjustment you create.

lighter the effect. You should start out with a lower
value — you can always increase it later if the effect
is too light.
• All Layers: Select this option to smudge pixels from all
visible layers, if your image has layers. The smudge still
appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit
different, depending on the underlying layers’ colors.
• Finger Painting: Select this option to begin the
smudge by using the foreground color. Rather than
use the color directly under the cursor, the tool
applies your chosen foreground color at the begin-
ning of each stroke.
3.
Brush over the areas you want to smudge. Think of
using this tool as dragging a paint brush through wet

Correcting Content,
Contrast, Color, and
Clarity
O
ne strength of Elements is its ability to assist you in almost any
editing endeavor. From incorrect color balance to flat contrast to
nitpicky flaws here and there, Elements is equipped with tools to tackle
most photographic problems. And, you don’t have to spend a lot of
your highly coveted time to do so, either. Chapter 7 gives you the low-
down on ultraquick auto fixes. But just in case they don’t quite do the
job, this chapter covers multi-step, manual techniques — a couple of
additional mouse clicks and a few swipes of an adjustment slider here
and there. 
If, after all corrections are applied, you’re still not happy with your
images, get out there and shoot again, if possible. That’s part of the
beauty of digital photography: No film processing means that you can
shoot to your heart’s content without worrying about anything other
than filling up your memory card. Find out what worked and what
didn’t work the first time around, and make adjustments. Shooting
the best image at the time of capture means less correction later.

In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, with an image
open (see Figure 8-1), choose Filter➪Correct Camera
Distortion. 
2.
In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, select the
Preview option.
3.
Specify your correction options:
• Remove Distortion: Corrects the lens barrel distor-
tion, which makes images appear spherised. This
effect, sometimes caused by using wide-angle lenses,
also corrects pincushion distortion, where images look
“pinched-in” at the center. This distortion is some-
times caused by using telephoto lenses. Move the
slider and use the grid as your guide for proper align-
ment for this option (and all the others, too).
• Amount: Adjusts the amount of vignetting (lighten-
ing or darkening) around the edges of an image,
which is caused by incorrect lens shading, stacking
filters, using the wrong lens, and other errors. Change
the width of the adjustment by specifying a midpoint
value. A lower midpoint value affects more of the
image. Then move the Amount slider.
• Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspec-
tive caused by tilting the camera up or down.

• Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs
caused by moving the camera. For the best results,
specify the angle of movement by using the Angle
option.
• Angle: Rotates the image to compensate for tilting
the camera. 
• Scale: Scales an image up or down to crop into the
image. Using this option eliminates the “holes” that
are created when blank areas remain on your canvas
after you correct the perspective in an image. Be sure
that if you scale up, the resolution is high enough to
compensate for the increase in dimension, or else
you degrade the image. 
• Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid; can also spec-
ify the grid line color.

Use Adjustment Layers
1.
In Full Edit mode, open an image. You can apply adjust-
ment layers to a background or a layer.
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used for correcting
color and contrast. The advantage of using it rather than applying
an adjustment directly on the image is that you can apply correc-
tions without permanently altering the pixels. Because the correc-
tion resides on a layer, you can edit, add, or delete an adjustment
at any time. Adjustment layers apply an adjustment only to all the
layers below them — and have no effect on the layers above
them. For more on layers, see Chapter 10.
2.
Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at the top of the
Layers panel.
3.
Choose an adjustment from the drop-down list: Levels,
Brightness/Contrast, Hue/Saturation, Gradient Map
(shown in Figure 8-3), Photo Filter, Invert, Threshold,
or Posterize.
4.
In your chosen adjustment layer’s dialog box, choose
your specific settings. Note that each adjustment is
described in this chapter, in Chapter 7, or in Chapter 12.
5.
Click OK to create the adjustment layer. It appears in the
Layers panel and is annotated by the adjustment layer
icon and a thumbnail image, as shown in Figure 8-3. The
thumbnail represents a layer mask described in the fol-
lowing tip. You can see the effect in Figure 8-4.
6.
To edit the adjustment layer, simply double-click the
adjustment layer in the Layers panel and adjust the set-
tings in the resulting dialog box. You can also adjust the
opacity of the adjustment layer to reduce the effect.
A layer mask is like a sheet of clear acetate that allows you to selectively
apply the adjustment to layers below it by applying shades from white
to black on the mask. If the mask is completely white, the adjustment is
fully applied to the layers. Black areas don’t show the adjustment, and
gray areas partially show the adjustment. The darker the gray, the less
it shows the adjustment. Use any painting tool, such as the Brush or
Gradient tool, to paint on the layer mask.

Correct Contrast with Levels
1.
In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, with an image open,
choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels.
If you can, avoid using the simple, but less effective, Brightness and
Contrast command. Levels enables you to adjust 256 levels of bright-
ness, whereas Brightness and Contrast adjusts all tones in your image
equally, without any regard to which areas need adjusting and which
don’t. Fixing shadows might make highlights overly bright.
2.
In the dialog box that appears, a histogram displays
how the pixels are distributed at each of the 256 levels
of brightness (or tones) in your image, as shown in
Figure 8-8. Shadows are on the left, midtones are in
the center, and highlights are on the right.
3.
In the Input Levels area, used to improve contrast, move
the black triangle to the right to darken shadows, or to
the left to lighten them. You can also enter values from
0 through 255 in the Input Levels boxes. 
4.
Move the white triangle to the left to lighten the high-
lights or to the right to darken them.
5.
Move the gray triangle to the left to lighten the mid-
tones, or to the right to darken them.
6.
After you correct the contrast in your image, as shown
in Figure 8-9, click OK to apply the adjustment. If you’re
not happy, click Reset.
You can also adjust contrast by setting your black and white points
using the eyedroppers in the Levels dialog box. Click the black eye-
dropper on the darkest black in your image, and click the white
eyedropper on the whitest white. All remaining pixels are redistrib-
uted between these two points. If you have a grayscale image, click
with the gray eyedropper to remove any color casts. Then click a
neutral gray in your image.
If your image suffers from too much contrast, adjust the sliders in the
Output Levels section. Move the black triangle to the right to reduce con-
trast and lighten the shadow areas. Move the white triangle left to
reduce the contrast and darken the highlight areas.

• Make a selection: Choose this method if you want to
apply the adjustment to just a portion of your image,
such as a face. A selection is important if the colors of
the other elements are satisfactory and just the skin
needs adjusting. See Chapter 9 for details on selections.
2.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin

Defringe to Clean Up Edges
1.
In Full Edit mode only, open an image that contains
layers with selected images whose edges are in need of
refinement — specifically, if your selections have halos,
or remnants of the background from which they were
selected, as shown in Figure 8-21.
2.
In the Layers panel, select the layer that contains your
selection in need of repair.
3.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
4.
In the dialog box, enter a value for the number of pixels
that need to be “defringed.” Initially, use a low value,
like 1 or 2. If the halo remains, you can increase the
value. The defringing process basically changes the color
of the pixels in the halo to match the color of neighbor-
ing pixels.

as shown in Figures 8-25 and 8-26. Filter (81) is
more subtle than the other two.
• Cooling Filter (80), (82) and (LBB): Adjusts the
white balance to make colors cooler (more blue).
Filter (82) is more subtle than the other two.
• Red, Orange, Yellow and others: Adjust the hue of
the image. Choose a color to eliminate a color cast
or to create a special effect.
3.
In the dialog box, move the Density slider to specify
the amount of color that’s applied. If you want, select
Preserve Luminosity to prevent the filter from darkening
the image.
4.
After you select a filter and set the options to your liking,

Eliminate Artifacts and Noise 
1.
In Full Edit mode, with an open image, choose a filter:
• Filter➪Pixelate➪Facet: This one-step filter (no dialog
box appears) breaks up your image using a subtle
posterizing effect by selecting pixels of similar bright-
ness and converting them to a single value. You can
apply the filter more than once, if needed. Be careful,
however: Too many applications cause your image to
look painted rather than photographed. Figure 8-27
shows an image with the facet filter applied.
• Filter➪Noise➪Median: This filter reduces contrast
between adjacent pixels by assigning the median value
of a pixel group to the center pixel in the group. In
the dialog box, choose the radius of the pixel group
that Elements uses to calculate that median value. In
laymen’s terms, lighter spots darken, whereas darker
spots lighten (see Figure 8-28). The Median option
can smooth artifacts but may blur too much. If so,
choose Edit➪Undo and try Despeckle or Facet.
• Filter➪Noise➪Despeckle: This one-step filter reduces
the contrast between adjacent pixels without affecting
edges. This filter may cause a slight blur. It can be
useful for scanned newspaper images.
• Filter➪Noise➪Reduce Noise: This filter can reduce
luminance noise (creating a grainy look) and artifacts.
The Strength option sets the amount of reduction. For
Preserve Details, a higher value removes less noise, but
retains detail. Reduce Color Noise eliminates random
colored pixels. Remove JPEG Artifacts removes the
blocks and halos of low-quality JPEG compression.
If the Median and Facet filters cause your images to lose crispness,
try sharpening the photos with a low radius setting. See details on
sharpening later in this chapter.

Heal Wrinkles and Blemishes with
the Healing Brush
1.
In Full Edit mode, select the Healing Brush tool from
the Tools panel. You can heal within a single image or
between two images in the same image mode.
2.
Specify your healing options:
• Brush Preset: Choose a brush type, diameter, and hard-
ness as needed. You can also adjust the spacing, angle,
and roundness. Using the appropriate brush to fix a
flaw is important for smooth, no-telltale retouching.
• Blend Mode: Choose a blend mode. For most heal-
ing tasks, the Normal default setting works well.
Replace mode preserves textures, like noise or film
grain, around the edges of your strokes. (Chapter 11
covers blend modes.)
• Source: Sampled uses the pixels from your image.
Pattern uses pixels chosen from the drop-down panel. 
• Aligned: When selected, the healing source moves as
you move your cursor. To heal from the same source
repeatedly, leave this option deselected.
• All Layers: Select this option to sample pixels from
all visible layers, if your image has them. If the
option is deselected, the tool samples only pixels
from the active layer.
3.
Press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the
healing source (the area of your image that you want to
heal from).
4.
Release the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and then click
or drag over the flawed area (where you want the healed
pixels to appear). See Figure 8-29.

5.
When you click or drag, the crosshair that appears is the
source you’re healing from. The Healing Brush cursor
is where the healed pixels are applied. If you chose
Aligned in Step 2, when you move the mouse the
crosshair moves as well. Keep an eye on the crosshair
because that’s the area you’re healing from. Figure 8-30
shows the image after its digital makeover.
Add a new, blank layer above your image before you start to heal.
Make the blank layer the active layer and select the All Layers
option. Then, as you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new
layer and not on the image itself. You can then adjust opacity, apply
blend modes, or make other image adjustments to fine-tune the
healed layer without affecting the underlying original image. 
Be careful not to overheal an image — unless, of course, you want
that maximum-Botox, “plastic” look. When people laugh and smile,
they naturally have some wrinkles, even when they’re young.

Eliminate Red Eye
1.
Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel.
2.
In the open image, click the red portion of the eye. The
red pupil should darken while retaining the tones and
textures of the eye, as shown in Figure 8-31.
3.
If the red-eye wasn’t fixed satisfactorily, adjust one or
both of these options, found on the Options bar:
• Pupil Size: Adjust the slider to increase or decrease
the size of the pupil. Feel free to zoom in with the
Zoom tool for more precision.
• Darken Pupil: Adjust the slider to darken or lighten
the color of the pupil, as shown in Figure 8-32.
Red-eye occurs when a person or an animal (animals usually end up
with yellow-, green-, or even blue-eye) looks directly into the flash.
Most cameras have a red-eye prevention mode, which is a preflash
that causes the subjects’ irises to contract, making their pupils
smaller when the real flash goes off. Other cameras mount the flash
high or to the side of the lens, which also reduces the chance of red-
eye. If you have either or both of these options, use them to prevent
red-eye when shooting.
If the Red Eye Removal tool didn’t work for your pet’s yellow-,
green-, or blue-eye, try the Color Replacement tool instead. Select
the pupil with either the Elliptical Marquee or Lasso tool. Then set the
foreground color to black, and brush with the Color Replacement
tool. For more on replacing color, see Chapter 7.

Blur for Effect or Elimination
1.
In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, with an image open,
choose Filter➪Blur and choose one of the following
blur commands:
• Average: Calculates the average value of the pixels
in the image and fills the area with that value. Can
smooth out noisy areas and also obliterate detail.
• Blur: Averages the value of the pixels next to the
edges of defined areas; applies a fixed, uniform blur
to the image. 
• Blur More: The same as Blur — only more so. 
• Motion Blur: Gives the appearance of a blur caused
by movement. Specify the angle of motion and the
distance of the blur, as shown in Figure 8-35. Select
the preview option to see the effect.
Why would you want to blur an image? If it suffers from a moiré
pattern (caused by scanning a halftone), applying a slight Gaussian
blur can help to soften the annoying pattern. You may also want to
blur an image to soften film grain or noise. Finally, blurring portions
of an image can help to remedy distracting background elements
and create a better focal point.

amount of blur. Choose the Spin method. Blur along
concentric circular lines or along radial lines (Zoom).
Select a Quality level. Specify where you want the
center of the blur by moving the blur thumbnail.
Note that radial blur, in particular, is memory inten-
sive and can be slow in rendering.
• Smart Blur: Has the honor of being the most precise
blur command. Specify values for the radius of the
area and the threshold. (See the definitions in the sec-
tion “Sharpen to Improve Focus,” later in this chap-
ter.) Start with a low value and increase if necessary.
Choose a Quality level and a mode setting. Normal
blurs the entire image, whereas Edge Only blurs only
the edges of the elements and applies black and white
in the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge blurs only the
edges and applies white to the blurred pixels. 
• Gaussian Blur: One of the oldest and most com-

Sharpen to Improve Focus
1.
In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, with an image open,
choose Filter➪Sharpen and then choose a command:
• Unsharp Mask: For the amount of edge sharpening,
the higher the value, the more contrast between pixels
around the edge. Start with 50 percent and adjust as
necessary. If you oversharpen, the image appears
grainy. Specify the radius (the width of the edges that
will be sharpened). For low-resolution images (72 ppi),
use a smaller radius, like .4 pixels. For high-resolution
images (300 ppi), use a higher radius, around 1.5 pix-
els). For the threshold, specify the difference (between
0 and 255) in brightness that must be detected
between pixels before the edge is sharpened. A lower
value sharpens edges that have little difference in con-
trast. Set the threshold to 0 unless the image is noisy
or grainy. That way, sharpening is applied uniformly,
as shown on the right in Figure 8-37.
• Adjust Sharpness: Specify the Amount and Radius
options. Choose a sharpening algorithm with the
Remove option. Gaussian Blur is used for Unsharp
Mask. Lens Blur preserves detail while eliminating
halos caused by sharpening. You can also choose
Motion Blur or More Refined, which apply the filter
slowly but more accurately, as shown in Figure 8-38.
2.
Click OK in the dialog box to apply the commands.
Always make sharpening the last correction you make. The last
thing you want to do is sharpen bad color, artifacts, noise, or nasty
flaws. But because sharpening can increase contrast, you may have
to redo your lighting adjustments.
Keep in mind that you can’t add focus that wasn’t there in the first
place. By sharpening in Elements, you merely create the illusion of
focus by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. Even
Elements can’t resurrect very blurry shots.

Creating Selections
S
ometimes, you want to use a photo just as it is. That is, you want
to keep intact all contents within the frame. Anything you do to
the photo, such as color or contrast adjustments, is done to the entire
photo. But at other times, you may want to correct only a portion of
the photo or use just a part of the image and combine it with another
image. That’s where the skill of making selections is valuable.
Making good selections is a skill that serves you well if you plan to
make the most of digital imaging tools and techniques. The more accu-
rate your selections, the higher the quality of your images. To make
selections in a digital image-editing program, like Elements, you specify
which part of an image you want. Elements provides you many options
to isolate pixels and create accurate selections.
In this chapter, you find out how to use many different selection tools
and methods that help you make accurate selections. Note that with the
exception of Selection Brush, your image must be in Full Edit mode.

a fly-out menu with the Elliptical Marquee tool. You
can also press the M key to access the tool. If the
Rectangular Marquee isn’t visible, press Shift+M.
2.
In your image, drag from one corner of an area to the
opposite. As you drag, you see a selection outline, also
called a selection marquee. You can move a selection out-
line while you’re making it with either of the Marquee
tools by pressing the spacebar as you drag.
To make a perfectly square or circular selection, press the Shift key
after you begin dragging. After you make a selection, release the
mouse button first and then the Shift key.
3.
Release the mouse button to complete the selection, as
shown in Figure 9-1.
Remember that when you have a selection in Elements, everything
within the selection outline is considered selected and everything
outside the selection outline is unselected. For example, if you
apply color adjustments, effects, or paint on your image, it affects
only the area within the selection outline. When you choose
Edit➪Copy, it copies only what is within the selection outline.

2.
Before you make a selection, select one or more of the fol-
lowing options on the Options bar, shown in Figure 9-3:
• Feather: Specify a value from 0 to 250 pixels.
Feathering creates a soft edge around your selection.
The higher the amount, the softer the edge. Very small
amounts can create a natural transition between ele-
ments in a multi-image composite. Large amounts can
create creative dissolves between multiple images. This
option is also available for the three Lasso tools.
• Anti-Alias: Select this option to soften an edge by
only 1 pixel. Anti-aliased edges are useful on jagged
edges and on selections combined in a multi-image
composite. This option is also available for the three
Lasso tools.
• Mode: Choose from three settings. In the Normal
(default) setting, you can freely drag your selection.
Fixed Aspect Ratio enables you to specify a fixed ratio
of width to height. Select Fixed Size to set an exact
width and height.
• Width and Height: Enter Width and Height values
when you select either Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed
Size mode.

Select Straight-Sided Polygons
1.
Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
The tool looks like a straight-sided rope. It shares a fly-
out menu with the Lasso and Magnetic Lasso tools.
You can also press the L key to access the tool. If the
Polygonal Lasso tool isn’t visible, press Shift+L.
2.
In your image, position the Polygonal Lasso cursor any-
where along the edge of the object you want to select.
A corner is usually a good place to start. The hotspot of
the cursor is the end, or tail, of the rope.
3.
Click and release at the starting point. Move (don’t
drag) the mouse cursor and click at the next corner
of the object. The polygonal lasso line that appears
stretches out with a rubber-band effect.
4.
Continue clicking and moving to each corner of the
object, as shown in Figure 9-5.
5.
Return to the starting point. Look for a small circle icon
that appears next to the Polygonal Lasso cursor. This
icon indicates that you’re about to close the selection
correctly. Release the mouse button to complete the
selection, and the polygonal lasso line converts into a

The tool looks like a straight-sided rope with a magnet.
It shares a fly-out menu with the Lasso and Polygonal
Lasso tools. You can also press the L key to access the
tool. If the Magnetic Lasso tool isn’t visible, press

2.
In the image, position the Magnetic Lasso cursor any-
where along the edge of the object you want to select.
The hotspot of the cursor is the end, or tail, of the rope.
3.
Click at the starting point to place the first fastening
point. Fastening points anchor the magnetic lasso line.
4.
Move (don’t drag) the mouse cursor around the edge of
your object. As you move it, you see the magnetic lasso
line and fastening points appear, as shown in Figure 9-7.
The line and points attempt to hug, or snap to, the edge
of the object, provided there’s enough contrast to distin-
guish the edge.
5.
If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts going awry and moving
away from the edge, back up the mouse cursor along the
magnetic lasso line and click to force down a fastening
point.
6.
If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a fastening point where
you don’t want one, press the Backspace key (or the

If you reach a point of frustration because your selection
isn’t working as planned, consider modifying the default
settings of the unique Magnetic Lasso options:
• Width: Choose a value between 1 and 256 pixels to
specify how close to the object’s edge you must move
the mouse cursor before the tool snaps to that edge.
If your image doesn’t have a lot of contrast, try using
a lower value.
• Edge Contrast: Enter a percentage between 1 and 100
percent to specify how much contrast is required
before the tool snaps to the edge of the object. Again,
if your image doesn’t have a lot of contrast, use a
lower percentage.
• Frequency: Choose a value from 1 through 100 to
specify how frequently to place a fastening point.
The higher the value you enter, the more points you
create. If the edge of your object has a lot of detail,
try a higher value. For smoother edges, a lower value
should be sufficient.
• Tablet Pressure: Select this option (the pen icon) if
you have a pressure sensitive drawing tablet and want
an increase in stylus pressure to cause the Width
value to decrease.
8.
Return to the starting point. Look for a small circle icon
that appears next to the Magnetic Lasso cursor. This icon
indicates that you’re about to close the selection correctly.
Release the mouse button to complete the selection.
Note that you can also double-click the mouse button
to complete the selection. After releasing the mouse
button, you see the magnetic lasso line convert into a
selection outline, as shown in Figure 9-8.

Wrangle Pixels with the Magic Wand
1.
Select the Magic Wand tool from the Tools palette. It
looks like a wand with a starburst. You can also press
the W key to access the tool.
2.
In your image, click anywhere within the area you want.
The selection that’s made is based on the color of the
pixel you click (specifically, the pixel directly under the
hotspot of your cursor). The amount of area that’s
selected is also determined by the Tolerance setting.
The Tolerance setting is based on brightness levels that range from
0 to 255. The default setting of 32 means that Elements selects all
pixels whose brightness levels are between 16 levels lighter and 16
levels darker than that of your base color (the color you clicked to
select). Ideally, the Magic Wand tool works best when you have
high-contrast images or images with a limited number of colors. If
your image is a bazaar of multiple colors, the Magic Wand proba-
bly isn’t an effective tool for making your selection.
3.
If you select everything you want on the first click,
you’re done. If your selection needs further modifica-
tion, as shown in Figure 9-9, go to Step 4.
4.
Specify a new Tolerance setting on the Options bar. If
the Magic Wand selects more than you want, lower the
Tolerance setting. If the wand doesn’t select everything
you want, increase the setting.
5.
Click the area again. Note that the Magic Wand doesn’t
modify your first click — it deselects the current selection
and makes a new one based on the new Tolerance value.

If your selection still isn’t satisfactory, you can select
these other options on the Options bar:
• Anti-alias: Select this option to slightly soften the
edge of the selection by one pixel.
• Contiguous: This option instructs the Magic Wand
to select only pixels that are adjacent to each other.
Unselected, the tool selects pixels, whether or not
they’re adjacent.
• All Layers: If you have multiple layers, the Magic
Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. Unselected,
the tool selects pixels from only the active layer. For
details on layers, see Chapter 10.
• Refine Edge: Click the Refine Edge button, and in the
dialog box, move the Smooth slider to reduce the
amount of jaggedness in your edges. For details on
feathering, see “Apply Marquee Options,” earlier in
this chapter. Move the Contract/Expand slider to the
left or right to decrease or increase the selected area.
Click the custom overlay color button to preview
your selection with its edges hidden and an overlay
of screen-only color in the unselected area.

Select the Selection Brush tool from the Tools palette. It
looks like a brush with a dotted oval and shares a fly-
out menu with the Quick Selection tool. You can also
press the A key to access the tool. If the Selection Brush
tool isn’t visible, press Shift+A.
2.
Specify your Selection Brush options on the Options bar:
• Brush Presets: Select a brush from the drop-down
panel. To load additional brushes, click the 
downward-pointing arrow and choose a preset library.
• Brush Size: Specify a brush size, from 1 to 2500 pix-
els, by entering the value or dragging the slider.
• Mode: Select either Selection or Mask. Selection
enables you to “build” a cumulative selection by
brushing over the area. Each brush stroke adds to your
selected area. In Mask mode, you create a selection by
eliminating the areas you don’t want. Again, each brush
stroke adds to the mask. The methodology is also a lit-
tle more complicated. First, you must select an overlay
(an on-screen layer of color) that covers your image,
indicating unselected areas. Next, choose an overlay
opacity between 1 and 100 percent. Then choose an
overlay color or leave it at the red default setting.
• Hardness: Enter a brush tip hardness, from 1 to 100
percent. If you want a brush with softer edges, enter a
lower value.
3.
In your image, if the mode is set to Selection, brush over
the areas you want to select. Remember that each brush
stroke adds to your selection. You see a selection border
appear, as shown in Figure 9-11. If you mistakenly select
something you don’t want, press the Alt key (or the
Option key on a Mac) and brush over the area.

If the mode is set to Mask, brush over the areas you
don’t want to select. As you brush, you see the overlay
color. Remember that each stroke adds to the mask, as
shown in Figure 9-12. If you mistakenly brush over an
area you don’t want, press the Alt key (or Option key
on a Mac) and brush over the area again. When you’re
done creating the mask, choose Selection from the
Mode drop-down list, to convert the mask into a selec-
tion outline. Remember that the selection outline is
drawn around the areas you don’t want. If you want to
choose what you do want, choose Select➪Inverse.
The Selection Brush works in either Full Edit mode or Quick Edit
mode.
Masking in Elements is a way to protect the areas you don’t want
from the effect of an action, whether it’s selecting, painting, or
adjusting color. Although using Mask mode is a little more complex
than Selection mode, the advantage is that you can make partial
selections. If you paint with a soft-edged brush, those soft edges are
partially selected, resulting in a feathered edge. If you set the opac-
ity of an overlay to a lower percentage, the selection is also par-
tially selected, or semitransparent. For example, set the opacity to
50 percent, and your selection is then only 50 percent selected.

In the image, position the Lasso cursor anywhere along
the edge of the object you want to select. The hotspot
of the cursor is the end, or tail, of the rope.
It may help to zoom in and out while using the Lasso tool so that you
can be more precise when selecting your element. To zoom in while
you’re using the Lasso tool, press Ctrl++ (or Ô++ on the Mac) with
your other hand. That’s Ctrl or Ô and the plus sign key. To zoom out,
press Ctrl+– (or Ô+– on a Mac).
3.
Hold down the mouse button and trace around the

Eraser erases all similarly colored pixels throughout
the image, regardless of adjacency.
• Tolerance: The tolerance value specifies how similar
the colors have to be to the base color (the color
of the pixel directly below the hotspot) before the
Background Eraser erases them. A higher tolerance
erases more colors. For more on tolerance, see the
earlier section “Wrangle Pixels with the Magic Wand.”

The Background Eraser attempts to erase the background while leaving
the foreground untouched. To produce the best results from this tool, be
careful to keep the hotspot (the cursor crosshair) on the background
pixels and away from any foreground elements. This tool is also best
used with images that have a definitive foreground and background
with good contrast between the two. A smooth edge without a lot of
detail also helps.
The Magic Eraser tool, which shares the flyout menu with the other
Eraser tools, is a hybrid of the Eraser tool and the Magic Wand. It
attempts to select and erase similarly colored pixels at the same time.
Select the tool and click the unwanted areas of your image. Options for
the Magic Eraser are similar to the two other Eraser tools, with the
exception of two unique settings: Anti-alias creates a softened edge by
one pixel, and the All Layers option enables you to sample colors using
all visible layers but erases pixels on only the active layer.

Using Layers
U
sing layers is like cooking a meal in a fully equipped kitchen: Sure,
you could do it over a hotplate if you had to, but having modern
conveniences, like a stove and an oven, make the process a whole lot
easier, quite a bit faster, and much more enjoyable. The benefits of using
layers are huge because they give you a ton of added editing flexibility.
Layers enable you to do things such as adjust the transparency of an
image or apply a special effect, like a layer style or blend mode. (Both
topics are covered in Chapter 11). They also let you easily combine
multiple images and move and edit them independently of one another.
Finally, layers help you experiment more comfortably with various tools
and techniques. Duplicate a layer in your image and try out a tool or
technique. If you don’t like it, just delete that layer and you’re back to
square one. No harm, no foul.
This chapter gives you the bare basics of working with layers. You’ll find
more involved techniques using layers within some of the other chap-
ters in this book. To work with layers, be sure that you’re in Elements’
Editor workspace in Full Edit mode. Note that the steps in this chapter
assume that you have an image open and ready to go.

Get Familiar with the Layers Panel
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel,
shown in Figure 10-1. The Layers panel controls the use
of layers. If your image doesn’t yet have layers, you may
see only a background in the Layers panel.
2.
Note the anatomy of the Layers panel:
• Layers: The order of layers in the panel reflects the
order of the layers in the image, with the topmost
layer at the top of the list, and the background at the
bottom of the stack, as shown in Figure 10-1. This is
the stacking order. You can work on a single layer or
multiple layers at a time. Select a layer by clicking the
layer name or its thumbnail. Select multiple layers by
Ctrl+clicking (or Control+clicking on the Mac).
• Blend Modes: These modes affect the interaction
of the colors in the layers. Normal is selected in
Figure 10-1. For more information about blend
modes, see Chapter 11.
• Opacity: Opacity affects how opaque or transparent
a layer is, in percentages from 0 to 100 percent. In
Figure 10-1, 100% is selected. For more information
about opacity, see Chapter 11.
• Icons: Click the small icons at the top of the panel to
create a new layer, create an adjustment layer, delete a
layer, link a layer, lock transparency, or lock all layers.
Locking all prevents you from editing or moving the
layer. All these commands are covered in this chapter,
except adjustment layers, discussed in Chapter 8.
• Pop-up Menu: Click the right-pointing triangle
labeled more to open a submenu of layer commands.
These commands are also on the Layer menu in the
Menu bar.
• Show/Hide Column: Click the eye icon to show and
hide layers.

Chapter 10: Using Layers

Convert a Background into a Layer
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
2.
Double-click Background in the Layers panel, as shown
in Figure 10-2; or, in the Menu bar, choose Layer➪New➪
Layer from Background.
3.
Name the layer or leave it with the default name Layer
0. You can also specify additional layer options, such as
Blend mode and opacity, if you want. Blend modes and
opacity are described in detail in Chapter 11.
4.
Click OK, and the background is converted into a layer,
as shown in Figure 10-3.
When you open a photo taken with a digital camera, open a file
from a CD, acquire a scan, download a stock image, or create a new
file with the Background Contents option set to White or
Background Color, you have a file with just a background. An image
contains only one background. You don’t have all the editing tools
and commands available for backgrounds, so you should convert
the background to a layer.
Layers created from images, including backgrounds, are image lay-
ers. A shape layer contains a vector-based object (mathematically
defined by points and paths), such as a polygon created by the
Shape tools. Fill layers enable you to add a layer of color, gradient,
or pattern. Type layers contain type. Find out more about type lay-
ers in Chapter 11. Adjustment layers are special layers used for
color and contrast correction. For more information about them, see
Chapter 8.

Create a New Layer
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
2.
Do one of the following:
• Select the Create a New Layer icon, the leftmost icon
at the top of the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 10-4.
• Choose New Layer from the Layers panel pop-up
menu.
• Choose Layer➪New➪Layer from the menu bar.
3.
If you create a layer by using either menu command,
name the layer and set options in the dialog box. You
can name a layer and specify blending and opacity
options. See Chapter 11 for more on blend modes
and opacity.
4.
Click OK. Your newly created blank layer appears.
Think of blank layers as digital sheets of acetate. You can put pho-
tos, graphics, or type on blank layers. Any area without a photo,
graphic, or type is transparent, just like acetate is. Transparency in
Elements is indicated on-screen by a gray-and-white checkerboard
pattern. You can stack layers on top of each other to create a com-
bined image, rearrange their order, and add or delete layers.
Figure 10-4: Create a new layer
After you create layers, you may want to select them. To do so, simply
click the layer name or thumbnail in the Layers panel. Elements then
highlights the active layer in the Layers panel. To select multiple contigu-
ous layers, click the first layer and then Shift+click the last layer. To select
multiple noncontiguous layers, Ctrl+click (or Ô+click on the Mac) the
layers you want.
➟

Chapter 10: Using Layers

Duplicate a Layer
1.
In an open image, do one of the following:
• Drag your chosen layer to the Create a New Layer
icon at the top of the Layers panel. A new layer is cre-
ated with the word copy appended to the layer name.
• Choose Duplicate Layer from the panel’s pop-up
menu, as shown in Figure 10-5.
• Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
2.
If you choose one of the menu commands, name the layer
and specify its destination (either a new document or any
open image) in the Duplicate Layer dialog box. Click OK.
Copy or Cut to Create a Layer
1.
Do one of the following:
• To copy an entire layer, simply select that layer in the
Layers panel.
• To copy or cut part of a layer, make a selection on
your layer or background. To create a new layer by
cutting, you need a selection outline. (Chapter 9
explains selections.)
2.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut,
as shown in Figure 10-6. Keep in mind that cutting
removes the selection and leaves a “hole” in your image.
3.
Elements creates a new layer and places the copied or
cut pixels on that layer.
Although some commands are exclusive, much of what you can do
with the Layers panel icons you can also do by using the Layers panel
pop-up menu and the Layers menu on the Menu bar. It doesn’t mat-
ter which you choose; if you can’t find what you’re looking for in one
area, go to another.

Copy or Cut to Create a Layer

Drag and Drop a Layer 
between Two Files
1.
In your first image, choose a layer in the Layers panel.
Note that if you want to drag only a portion of the
image, you must first make a selection. See Chapter 9
for more on selections.
2.
Select the Move tool from the Tools panel.
3.
Place the Move tool on your image and drag and drop
the layer onto the second image, as shown in Figure 10-7,
and release the mouse button. If you’re dragging and
dropping a selected portion of the layer, place the Move
tool within the selection outline before dragging and
dropping. You now have a composite image with two
layers.
4.
Repeat Step 3 as needed. A finished composite made
from several images is shown in Figure 10-8.
Dragging and dropping layers between files is more efficient than
copying and pasting, because it bypasses the Clipboard, a tempo-
rary storage area on your computer for copied or cut data. This
temporarily stored data uses computer memory, which can bog
down your system performance.

Select a Layer
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
2.
To select a layer, just click it in the Layers panel, as
shown in Figure 10-9.
3.
Or, choose Select from the Menu bar and select one of
the following commands:
• Select All Layers: Selects all layers in your file.
• Select Layers of Similar Type: Selects all layers of a
similar flavor, such as image layers, type layers, shape
layers, or adjustment layers. First select a layer type
and then choose the command.
Delete a Layer
1.
In the Layers panel, select the layer you want to delete.
2.
Drag the layer to the Trash icon at the top of the Layers
panel, as shown in Figure 10-10. You can also just click
the Trash icon. If you do so, click OK in the dialog box
to delete the layer.

View and Hide Layers
1.
To hide a layer, click the eye icon just to the left of
the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 10-11. When the layer is hidden, you see a blank
box, not the eye.
2.
To view the layer, click the blank box just to the left of
the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel.
3.
To hide all layers except one, select a layer and Alt+click
(or Option+click on the Mac) the eye icon for that layer.
Redisplay all layers by Alt+clicking (or Option+clicking
on the Mac) the eye icon again.
Note that only visible layers are printed, which can be helpful if you
want to print separately the different versions of an image within
the same file.
Rearrange the Stacking Order
of Layers
1.
To move a layer to another position in the stacking
order, drag it up or down in the Layers panel. As you
drag, you see a fist icon, as shown in Figure 10-12.
2.
Release the mouse button when a highlighted line
appears where you want to insert the layer in the stack
of layers. Remember that the topmost layer in the stack
is the topmost layer in your image.
If your image contains a background, that background must remain
the bottommost layer. If you need to move the background, first
convert it to a layer by double-clicking the name in the Layers
panel. Enter a name for the layer and click OK.

Chapter 10: Using Layers

Rename a Layer
1.
Double-click the layer name in the Layers panel. The
existing name is highlighted.
2.
Type a name directly in the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 10-13. You can also double-click the layer thumb-
nail in the Layers panel. The Layers Properties dialog box
appears, enabling you to type a new name. Click OK.
Note that, in Elements, when you create a new layer from scratch,
it provides that layer with default names, such as Layer 1 and
Layer 2. Get into the habit of giving your layers more descriptive
names, especially if you plan on having several layers, so that you
can more easily locate the layer you want later.
Link Layers
1.
In the Layers panel, click the first layer and then
Ctrl+click (or Ô+click on the Mac) all the other layers
you want to link.
2.
Click the Link Layers icon at the top of the Layers panel.
A link icon (it looks like a chain) appears to the right of
the layer name, as shown in Figure 10-14.
3.
To unlink any layers, select some layers and then click
the Link Layers icon again.
You don’t need to link layers to perform commands such as moving
or sizing several layers simultaneously. Merely selecting them and
then applying your transformation works just fine. But if you want
your layers to group together more securely, feel free to link and
unlink as needed.

Lock Layers
1.
Select a layer in the Layers panel.
2.
Lock the layer in one of these two ways:
• Lock transparency: To lock the transparent areas of
a layer, click the checkerboard icon at the top of the
Layers panel, as shown in Figure 10-15. When the
transparent areas are locked, you can’t edit or paint
on any of them on the layer.
• Lock all: To lock everything on a layer, click the Lock
icon at the top of the Layers panel. When all elements
are locked, you can’t alter the layer in any way, includ-
ing moving or transforming it.
3.
To unlock the layer, click the respective icon again.
If you have a background in your image, it’s locked by default.
To unlock the background, you must convert it into a layer.
Select the Contents of a Layer
1.
Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
2.
To merely select a layer, just click it in the Layers panel.
However, if you want to place a selection outline around
the contents of a layer, press the Ctrl key (or the Ô key
on the Mac) and click the Layer thumbnail in the Layers
panel. You then see a selection outline around all pixels
on that layer, as shown in Figure 10-16.
Use the Auto Select Layer option on the Options bar to interactively
select the contents of a layer when you hover the mouse over any
of the pixels. To have a highlighted outline appear around the layer
contents, select the Show Highlight on Rollover option, also on the
Options bar.

Chapter 10: Using Layers

Transform a Layer
1.
Select a layer, or layers, in the Layers panel. Choose
Image➪Transform➪Free Transform. A bounding box
appears around the layer contents.
2.
Drag a corner handle to size the contents. Press Shift
while dragging to constrain the proportions.
3.
Move the cursor just outside a corner handle until it
converts into a curved-arrow icon. Drag clockwise or
counterclockwise to rotate, as shown in Figure 10-17.
4.
To distort, skew, or apply perspective to the layer, right-
click (or Control+click on the Mac) and choose a com-
mand from the context menu. Alternatively, you can
click the rotate, scale, and skew icons or enter transfor-
mation values on the Options bar.
5.
After you transform your layer, double-click inside the
bounding box.
Try to execute all transformations in one command! Each time you
apply a transformation, you resample the image. (See Chapter 7
for more on resampling.) Repeated interpolation can degrade the
image quality.
Adjust the Opacity of a Layer
1.
Select a layer in the Layers panel.
2.
At the top of the Layers panel, drag the Opacity slider to
the left to reduce the percentage of opacity and increase
the amount of transparency. Note that if you have a
layer underneath the active layer, you see more of the
underlying layer, as shown in Figure 10-18. If you don’t
have a layer underneath the active layer, you see the
transparency checkerboard start to appear. The opacity
percentage ranges from 0 to 100 percent.

Simplify a Layer
1.
Select a type, shape, or fill layer in the Layers panel.
2.
Choose Simplify Layer from the Layers panel pop-up
menu, as shown in Figure 10-19, or choose Layer➪
Simplify Layer. The type, shape, or fill layer is converted
into an image layer.
To apply a filter or certain edits, such as painting, to type, shape, or
fill layers, you must simplify them first. A shape layer contains a
vector object (an object drawn with mathematical formulas indi-
cated by points and paths). A fill layer contains solid color, a gradi-
ent, or a pattern. Type layers contain text.
Merge Layers
1.
Click the eye icon to the left of the layer thumbnail to
hide any layers that you don’t want to merge.
2.
Choose Merge Visible from the Layers panel pop-up
menu, as shown in Figure 10-20. Note that you can also
choose Layer➪Merge Visible. All visible layers are com-
bined into a single layer.
3.
To merge two adjacent layers, select the topmost layer
and choose Merge Down from the Layers panel pop-up
menu or Layer menu. The topmost layer is merged with
the layer directly below it.
4.
If you make a mistake, immediately choose Edit➪Undo.
You can also use the Undo History panel.
Merging combines layers on the basis of which ones are visible,
which ones are linked, or which ones are adjacent. Although merg-
ing layers reduces the size of your file, be sure that you don’t need
the editing flexibility of separate layers. After you merge files, you
can’t “unmerge” them.

Flatten Layers
1.
Make sure that all layers you want to keep and flatten
are visible. If you have any hidden layers, Elements asks
whether you want to discard them.
2.
Choose Flatten Image from the Layers panel pop-up
menu, as shown in Figure 10-21. All layers are combined
into a single background.
3.
If you make a mistake, immediately choose Edit➪Undo.
You can also use the Undo History panel.
Remember that flattening is permanent, so you should always keep
your original file with the layers intact. That way, if you ever need
to go back and make edits, you have the added editing flexibility
of separate layers. Create a copy of your file and then choose
File➪Save As and select the As a Copy option. Flatten the copy
while retaining your original.

o you cleaned up your images: Your image has the perfect crop,
inviting color, excellent contrast, sharp focus, and no flaws. Now
what? Well, you can always share them with friends and loved ones and
even with perfect strangers, if you want to. Often the simplest image
is the best one and the one with the greatest impact. But if you feel
inclined to add an embellishment or two first, this chapter is the place
to do just that.
The tools and techniques described in this chapter enable you to add an
enhancement, a special effect, or even just the written word. You may
find — after experimenting with various blend modes, filters, effects,
and types — that you like your image the way it was. That’s fine. Just
be sure to make a copy of the image, or at least the layer, before you
wander away on other artistic endeavors.

1296 points. Or, you can visually size the type by
dragging the handles of the bounding box. Be sure to
press the Shift key when dragging so that you don’t
size the type disproportionately.
• Choose whether to anti-alias the text. Remember that
anti-aliasing adds one row of pixels for a softer edge.
If you’re creating small text for Web or screen display,
you may not want to apply anti-aliasing.
• Choose a style, if you want. Styles include Faux Bold,
Faux Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough. Keep in

The Type Mask tools, both Horizontal and Vertical, don’t create
actual type. They create selection outlines in the shape of your let-
ters. After they’re created, you can treat them like any other selec-
tion outline. See more on selections in Chapter 9.
Be forewarned that the Type Mask tools put the selection outlines
on the active layer. Elements doesn’t automatically create a new
layer, as it does with actual type.

2.
Select a layer and select a blend mode from the drop-
down list in the Layers panel. A brief description of
some modes follows, but the best way to get a feel for
the blend modes is to experiment. Figures 11-14 and
11-15 show examples of several blend modes.
• Normal: Shows the pixels unadjusted in any way.
• Dissolve: Enables some pixels from underlying layers
to show through the selected or top (also referred to
as target) layer. You must set the opacity of the target
layer to less than 100 percent.
• Darken: Makes lighter pixels become transparent if
pixels on the target layer are lighter than those below.
• Multiply: “Burns” the target layer onto underlying
layers, darkening colors where they mix.
• Color Burn: Darkens the layers below the target layer,
again burning them with color. Using this mode is
similar to applying a dark dye on your image.
• Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in underlying layers
and applies colors from the target layer. Using this
mode is similar to applying a bleach on your image.
• Soft Light: Darkens pixels that are greater than 50
percent gray and lightens pixels that are less than 50
percent gray. Using this mode is similar to shining a
soft spotlight on the image.
• Difference: Produces a negative effect.
• Color: Blends the luminance of underlying layers
with the saturation and hue of the target layers. Use
this mode for colorizing grayscale images.

the upper-right corner of the Effects panel:
• Frame: Enhances the edges of the layer or selection,
as shown in Figure 11-16.
• Faded Photo, Old Photo, Monotone Color, and
Vintage Photo: These effects makes your image look
faded, old, sketched with a pencil, colored with a sin-
gle color, or printed on vintage paper (as shown in
Figure 11-17).
• Miscellaneous Effects: Includes a variety of effects,
such as lizard skin, neon tubes, and oil pastel.
• Show All: Shows all effects in the list.
5.
In the Effects panel, double-click an effect or drag the
effect onto the image. You can also apply a photo effect
to a type layer. An alert box alerts you that the type layer
must be simplified before the filter can be applied. See
“Simplify Type,” earlier in this chapter.
Effects alter pixels to create special effects. You have no options to
specify and, unfortunately, you cannot preview the effect before
you apply it. Some effects automatically create a duplicate of the
selected layer. Other effects can work only on flattened images.

Getting Creative with
Compositions
A
fter you crop, correct, contrast, and clarify, you’re ready for the last c
word — creative. I mean, all work and no play makes digital image
editing a dull boy. Although Elements gives you a multitude of tools for cor-
recting, repairing, and enhancing, it also provides lots of opportunity for you
to create interesting compositions — quickly and easily. 
The techniques in this chapter are performed in Photoshop Elements. You
can use the same techniques in Photoshop and most likely modify them for
use in other digital image editing programs. And, remember: There’s no sub-
stitute for opening some images and experimenting. Sometimes the most
interesting creations are the ones you stumble upon through play.

5.
On the duplicated layer, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Color Variations. Adjust the color for each tonal range
as noted in the following list. Again, you may need to
adjust higher or lower for your particular image. Your
goal is to add red and greenish or yellowish tones for an
antiqued appearance, as shown in Figure 12-2.
• Shadows: Move the Color Intensity slider to the right
one notch to increase the increment of intensity.
Click More Red two or three times. Click More Green
one time. Move the Color Intensity slider back to the
center. Click Darken once.
• Midtones: Make the same adjustments for midtones
as you made for the shadows.
• Highlights: Click More Red one time. Click More
Green one time. Click OK.
6.
On the duplicated layer, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Color Curves. Drag the slider for the midtone contrast
to the left until it’s about halfway to the maximum.
Drag the Adjust Shadows slider the same amount.
Again, depending on the image, you may need to adjust
the amount. Your goal is to increase the contrast in 
the middle and darker tonal ranges, as shown in 
Figure 12-2. Click OK.
7.
Finally, on the duplicated layer, choose Enhance➪
Unsharp Mask. Set the Amount to 100, the Radius to 1,
and the Threshold to 8. Click OK.

double-clicking it in the Layers panel. Name it color
and click OK.
2.
Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to create a copy of the
image. Name the duplicate grayscale and click OK.
3.
On the grayscale layer, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation. Drag the Saturation slider to the
far left to desaturate the layer. Click OK.
4.
Choose one of these techniques:
• Drag the color layer above the grayscale layer. Select
the Soft Light blend mode for a hand-tinted effect.
For more color, try the Overlay blend mode with 50
percent opacity.
• Choose Layer➪New➪Layer or click the New Layer
icon in the Layers panel. Choose the Color blend
mode. Select the Brush from the Tools panel, and
choose a soft-tip brush from the Brush Preset drop-
down panel. Click the Foreground color swatch in the
Tools panel and choose a new color from the Color
Picker. Paint on the first part of the image. Adjust the
layer opacity. Repeat the process for other portions of
the image, using separate layers for each color. For
better accuracy, make selections before brushing on
color. Figure 12-4 shows the tinted image.
You can also convert a color image to grayscale by choosing
Enhance➪Convert to Black and White. Choose a preset style in the
lower-left corner of the dialog box. Fine-tune the conversion by
dragging the RGB sliders. Click OK when you like the results.
Choosing Hue/Saturation and Convert to Black and White are bet-
ter ways to convert to grayscale than choosing Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale, which can leave an image looking flat.

On that duplicated layer, choose the Lighten blend
mode from the Modes drop-down list in the Layers
panel. The Lighten blend mode works by comparing the
two layers and replacing the darker pixels with lighter
ones. Light pixels are left unchanged.
5.
Adjust the Opacity slider in the Layers panel to reduce
the amount of glow, if you want.
This effect works nicely with portraits.

2.
Click Add Open Files to use all open files or click
Browse and navigate to your files or folder.
3.
Choose a merge mode in the Layout area:
• Auto: Elements automatically merges the source files.
• Perspective: For images with perspective (or angle).
• Cylindrical: For images shot with a wide-angle lens
or 360-degree panoramic images.
• Reposition Only: Elements repositions images with-
out compensating for any distortion.
If you choose any of the preceding modes, Elements opens and
automatically stitches together the source files to create a compos-
ite panorama in the work area of the dialog box. If Elements alerts
you that it can’t make the panorama, you then have to stitch the
images manually. If you choose any of these modes, skip to Step 6.
• Interactive Layout: Elements tries to stitch the images,
but you may have to complete the panorama manually.
4.
If needed, adjust images manually, as shown in Figure
12-7. Use the Select Image tool to drag the image
thumbnails from the light box area to the work area.
Use the Rotate Image tool to rotate the thumbnails.
Check the Snap to Image option so that overlapping
images snap into place automatically. The Zoom, Move
View, and the Navigator view box help you view and
navigate.

as the vanishing point. Adjust the other images as
needed.
6.
Click OK to apply the photomerge and close the 
dialog box. Elements opens a new image in the native
Photoshop Elements file format, shown in Figure 12-8.
To construct the best combined panoramic image, start with the best
original photos. Make sure that when you shoot, you overlap your
shots by 15 to 40 percent. Next, try to avoid using distortion lenses
and your camera’s zoom setting. Then try to keep the same expo-
sure settings for all shots. Finally, try to stay, at minimum, in the
same position and keep your camera at the same level for all pho-
tos. The best method is to use a tripod with a rotating head.

2.
In the dialog box, select the Preview option to view the
results. Specify the number of levels you want. Choose
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values, such as 2
through 8, create an illustrative look, as shown in 
Figure 12-9 (which uses a value of 3). Higher values 
create a more realistic appearance. If you posterize a
grayscale image and use two levels, you achieve a high-

Posterize is one of the Elements color mappers, which change the
colors of your image by mapping them to other values. All map-
pers, including Posterize, are on the Filter➪Adjustments submenu,
including Equalize (darkest and lightest pixels are black or white,
and the rest are redistributed to gray), Gradient Map (maps colors
to a gradient), Invert (reverses colors), and Threshold (all pixels are
either black or white). Open an image and give these options a try.

Organizing and
Managing Your
Images
I
don’t know about you, but I have boxes of photos begging to be put
into photo albums or at least labeled and organized into some sem-
blance of a grouping. But somehow this task never seems to even come
close to the top of my to-do list. Fortunately, the task of organizing digi-
tal photos has been made less labor intensive with the creation of digi-
tal asset-management software programs.
Digital assets can include anything from digital photos to video or audio
files to PDF files. Several programs are out there, from the simple and
inexpensive to the more complex and costly. Many cameras come with
their own basic proprietary programs. Some of the more popular third-
party programs are Canto Cumulus, Extensis Portfolio, Microsoft
Expression Media, Adobe Lightroom, and Apple’s Aperture. If you’re an
Elements user, however, you don’t need a stand-alone program. In addi-
tion to being a great image editor, Elements provides the Organizer, a
workspace that takes care of your photo-management needs. The
Organizer is found only in the Windows version of Elements, however.
If you’re a Mac user, you can use Adobe Bridge or iPhoto to manage
your assets. Because I can’t cover all existing software flavors in this
chapter, I give you the basics of using Elements for your photo organiza-
tion and management. I recommend jumping on the organization
bandwagon from the get-go. That way, you’re sure to avoid the digital
version of the anonymous bulging shoebox.

Open the Elements Organizer
1.
Launch Elements. At the Welcome screen, click
Organize, as shown in Figure 13-1. If you’re already in
Elements, in the Editor, click the Organize tab in the
upper-right corner.
2.
The Organizer workspace opens, as shown in 
Figure 13-2. The Organizer is the workspace within
Elements where you can locate, import, organize, sort,
search for, and manage your photos. If you have already
added images to the Organizer, they appear in the 
window, referred to as the Photo Browser.
3.
If you want to go to, or return to, the Editor workspace,
click the Editor tab in the upper-right corner and choose
a mode — Full Edit, Quick Edit, or Guided Edit.
Adobe Elements uses two main workspaces: the Editor and the
Organizer. For retouching and manipulation, you use the Editor. For
importing, viewing, finding, sorting, and managing photos, you use
the Organizer. You find the Organizer only in the Windows version
of Elements. The Mac version of Elements uses Adobe Bridge to
organize and manage digital assets.

Add Files to the Organizer
1.
In the Elements Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and
Video➪From Files and Folders.
2.
Navigate to your hard drive and select the folder con-
taining your chosen images. Or, if you’re pulling images
from a CD or DVD, navigate to that media and select
the photos you want to import.
3.
If you’re importing from your hard drive, from the dia-
log box, select a file type or choose All Files to import
your files, as shown in Figure 13-3. If you’re pulling
images from a CD or DVD, select the Copy Files on
Import option to import a high-resolution copy of the
image. Or, select Generate Preview to import a low-
resolution copy of the image. If you want to keep the
original master photo offline, type the name of the 
volume for the CD or DVD that contains the photo.
4.
Select the Automatically Fix Red Eyes option to elimi-
nate any red-eye effect in your photos upon import.
5.
Click the Get Photos button to import your images into
the Organizer (see Figure 13-4).
You can also easily acquire images in the Organizer from files on a
digital camera, memory card, or mobile phone or from a scan or
video. See Chapter 6 for more details.

View Files in the Organizer
1.
After opening the Elements Organizer and adding
images to the workspace, you can view your images.
2.
The Photo Browser, shown in Figure 13-5, shows, by
default, thumbnail images of your photos. If you have
added video clips, the first frame of the video is dis-
played. Audio files are also displayed and are indicated
by a sound icon. Use the arrows in the upper-left area
(above the Browser) to scroll through the thumbnails.
You can also use the scroll bars.
3.
To change the view of your images, click Display in the
upper-right corner of the Elements window and choose
Thumbnail View, View Photos in Full Screen, or
Compare Photos Side by Side.
4.
To change the size of the image thumbnail (shown in
Figure 13-6), move the Size slider to the left or right. It’s
directly above the Photo Browser. You can also rotate
selected photos by clicking the Rotate buttons just to the
left of the Size slider.
5.
To view the details attached to an image, such as date or
ratings, select the Details check box.
6.
Use the View menu (on the Menu bar) to display
images by media type, filename, details, or other 
criteria.
7.
To select a photo, click it in the Photo Browser. After
photos are selected you can add them to projects and
e-mails, edit them, or add various tags for easier sorting
and locating later, as described later in this chapter.

Create Catalogs
1.
In the Elements Organizer, choose File➪Catalog.
2.
In the Catalog Manager dialog box, shown in 
Figure 13-7, click New to create a catalog.
3.
In the New Catalog dialog box, enter a name for your
catalog. You can also choose to import free music when
creating a new catalog.
4.
Click OK. Elements saves all catalogs in a default folder
(Catalog folder) at a fixed location on your hard drive.
Be sure to be consistent with this saving methodology
so that you can always locate your catalogs.
5.
From your catalog, you can now create subsets of
images (albums), tag images with keywords, and rank
them with stars. Note that the catalog is simply a refer-
ence of, or a link to, the files. It displays thumbnails and
the corresponding metadata (information about the
image, such as date and exposure) of each image, but
the actual files are stored in their original location 
(on the hard drive or a CD, for example).
When you first launch Elements, by default it automatically equips
you with an initial catalog file, where all files you acquire in the
Organizer are cataloged. Most people choose to have a single cata-
log, but as your catalog starts to become overly large and unwieldy,
you may want to create additional catalogs (for example, for each
employee or family member). That way, you can manage your
images more productively, as shown in Figure 13-8.

Create Albums
1.
In the Elements Organizer, click the Create New Album
icon (a plus sign) in the Albums palette in the Organize
Bin on the right side of the window.
2.
Choose New Album from the submenu, as shown in
Figure 13-9. You can also choose a new smart album
(an album based on a criteria such as a keyword tag) 
or new album group (a group of albums).
3.
In the Create Album dialog box, enter a name for the
album and add any notes you have about the album,
such as Alaskan Vacation. The icon appears as a ques-
tion mark until you add your first photo.
4.
Click OK. Your new album appears in the Albums
palette.
5.
To add a photo to the album, select the photo (or pho-
tos) in the Photo Browser and drag it from the browser
into the album in the Albums palette, as shown in
Figure 13-10. You can also drag the album from the
Albums palette into the Photo Browser onto the photo.
The first photo then becomes the icon for the Album.
Albums in Elements resemble analog hard-copy albums. Create an
album and then store and organize your photos in it. You can then
just display the albums or use them in various projects. Each photo
in an album is numbered, and the same photo can appear in more
than one album.

Find Files in the Organizer
1.
In the Elements Organizer, you can search for images in
different ways and also by various criteria:
• Timeline: Set a date range to find images chronologi-
cally. (See the details in the section “Sort Images with
the Timeline,” later in this chapter).
• Find Bar: Drag a photo, a tag, a project, or an album
here to find similar files.
• Find➪By Caption or Note, shown in Figure 13-11:
Choose this command to search for images by cap-
tions or notes that you added. (See “Add a Caption,”
at the end of this chapter). You can also choose other
criteria from the submenu, such as File Name,
History, Media Type, Details (metadata), Unknown
dates, Untagged images, and even Visual Similarity.
Choose Faces for Tagging to find all photos where a
face appears. And then, you may want to tag those
images with a keyword for quicker locating later. 
(See “Create and Tag Images with Keywords,” later in
this chapter.)
• Albums palette: Use this palette in the Organize Bin
on the right side of the window to find and view 
contents of albums.
• Keywords palette: Use this palette in the Organize
Bin to find and view the images with a selected key-
word tag only. See details in the later section “Create
and Tag Images with Keywords.”
• Use the Star Rating filter above the Photo Browser to
find and view the images with a particular rating, as
shown in Figure 13-12. To add a rating, select the
photo (or photos) in the Photo Browser, choose
Edit➪Ratings and choose from No Rating to 5 Stars.
Tag your favorite photos with five stars to find them quickly and easily.

Create and Tag Images 
with Keywords
1.
In the Elements Organizer, click the new button 
(the plus-sign icon) in the Keyword Tags palette in 
the Organizer Bin. Choose New Tag.
2.
In the Create Keyword Tag dialog box, type a name for
the tag. Choose a keyword category. You can also associ-
ate the tag with a place on the map. (Enter a location,
such as Japan, and a map appears on the left side of 
the window.) Specify any descriptive words. Note that
the first time you attach the tag to a photo, that photo
becomes the tag’s icon. You can later change the icon, 
if you want.
3.
Click OK.
4.
To attach a keyword tag to an image, first select it (or
multiple images) in the Photo Browser, as shown in
Figure 13-15.
5.
Drag the photos onto the tag in the Keyword Tags
palette. Conversely, you can also drag the tag onto the
photos. Note that you can apply multiple keyword tags
to an image. To remove a tag, right-click the photo and
choose Remove Keyword Tag from the context menu.
A keyword tag is a word or phrase, such as Susie or European vaca-
tion, that you can attach to images (and other digital media assets,
as well as PDFs) to more easily locate them.

Sharing Your Photos
A
fter you crop, color-correct, contrast, clarify, and creatively polish
your photos, you may feel that it’s high time you share them with
the world. You can send photos as e-mail attachments or as photo mail,
post them to an online sharing site, burn them to CD or DVD, export
them as a slide show PDF or movie, or add them to a blog. If you want
to print them and pass them out, see Chapter 15. If you want to make
projects — such as greeting cards, photo books, and calendars — check
out the Elements Creations feature or Web sites such as Shutterfly.com
and Kodak.com. Whatever format your images take and however you
share them, they’re sure to be appreciated by your family and friends.

Printing Your
Images
I
f you’re like most people, viewing images on-screen is fine and
dandy, but eventually you want to print an image or two. The biggest
issue to keep in mind is that it can be challenging to make what you see
on-screen match what’s printed on paper. First, you calibrate your
equipment and find out how to create and use color profiles (briefly
explained in Chapter 7). Then you color-correct your images to make
sure that they look great on-screen (see Chapters 7 and 8). Next, you get
to know your own printer or service provider or online print service.
Understanding what kind of output to expect can help you make neces-
sary tweaks and adjustments in your images’ color and in the color set-
tings on your computer and printer. Finally, you complete numerous
test prints until you’re satisfied with the quality of your prints. Yes, it all
takes time, but it’s time well spent.

Prepare Images for Printing
1.
Make all contrast, color, and clarity adjustments that
you want. See Chapters 7 and 8 for details.
2.
Use the proper resolution. A resolution that’s too low
results in a print of inferior quality. A resolution that’s too
high results in an unnecessarily large and cumbersome
file size. Generally, use a resolution that’s two times the
lines per inch (lpi), of your printed output. Ask your ven-
dor, client, service provider, or end destination (newspaper
or magazine) what it recommends. If you’re printing an
image yourself, check out the printer user manual and
follow its recommendation. If all else fails, a resolution of
300 dots per inch (dpi) works for most print jobs.
3.
Save the image in the proper file format (see Figure 15-1).
For print, stick with the following formats: Photoshop
EPS, Photoshop PDF, PSD, and TIFF. TIFF is compatible
with most programs and platforms.
4.
Use the proper color mode, and avoid using Indexed
Color mode for printing. The color gamut (range) is
quite limited, and images may appear dithered or
blocky. RGB mode is fine for printing on your desktop
color printer or for ordering prints online or at kiosks. 
If you’re preparing an image for offset printing, it must
be converted to process color, or CMYK (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black), which Elements doesn’t support 
(but full-scale Photoshop does).
5.
Apply transformations in your native application. If
you’re preparing the image to import into another pro-
gram, always execute all image transformations in your
native application, such as Elements. Scale, rotate, skew,
and manipulate the image to its final appearance in
Elements so that the processing of the image data is
quicker when printing. Try not to do any resizing and
rotating in the application you’re importing the image to.

Chapter 15: Printing Your Images

6.
Limit the number of typefaces. If you added type to
your image, you may want to limit the number of fonts
you use. Not only does the image then look more pol-
ished, but you also reduce the time it takes to download
those fonts to the printer.
7.
Print from your native application first. Even if you’re
planning to import your image into another program,
always print initially from your native application, such
as Elements. If the image doesn’t print from Elements
for some reason, it won’t print from another application
and you at least eliminate one step from your trou-
bleshooting process.
8.
Allow time and resources for test prints. The world of
screen viewing and the world of printing on paper are
rarely identical. If you’re printing the images yourself,
give yourself enough time, paper, and ink to tweak 
color adjustments — in your program and in your spe-
cific printer’s settings, including color-management 
settings — until you’re satisfied with the results. Get to
know your printer’s strengths, weaknesses, and inclina-
tions. If you’re sending prints to a service provider or
online printer, check to see whether it has recommenda-
tions for “prepping” your files. You may have to print a
few rounds before you produce something you’re
pleased with.

Prepare Images for Printing

Print a Single Photo from Windows
1.
In the Organizer, select a photo (or photos) and choose
File➪Print. You can also open an image in the Editor
and choose File➪Print. See specific print options in the
later section “Print a Single Photo from a Mac.”
2.
In the Print Photos dialog box, select a printer from the
Select Printer drop-down list. Depending on your
printer model, printer-specific options may appear.
3.
Select Individual Prints from the Select Type of Print
drop-down list. To add photos, click the Add button,
and select the check box next to a photo (or photos). To
remove a photo, select an image thumbnail and click
the Remove button.
4.
Select a print size from the drop-down list.
5.
If you’re printing more than one photo and want one
photo per page, select the One Photo Per Page check
box.
6.
Select the Crop to Fit check box to have the image fit
into your chosen print size.

Chapter 15: Printing Your Images

• The Other section: Select Invert Image if you’re print-
ing to transfer paper. Transfer paper is used for print-
ing on T-shirts and other types of material. Indicate
whether you want crop marks around your image as
a guide in cutting, and enter a maximum print reso-
lution, if you want. I recommend leaving the resolu-
tion as is for this option, unless you just want a
quick, preliminary print of a high-resolution image.
For more on the important topic of resolution, see
Chapter 7.
• The Add a Border check box: Select to add as much
as a 2-inch border. Click the Color swatch to choose
a border color. Select the Include Trim Guidelines
check box to add crop marks for cutting purposes.

Specify Color-Management Settings
1.
Choose File➪Print.
2.
In the Print dialog box, in the Color Management sec-
tion, you can choose one of these three options from
the Color Handling drop-down list:
• Printer Manages Color: Your printer decides which
profile to use when your photo is sent to the printer.
It makes this decision based on the type of paper you
select as the source paper. If you choose another
paper, your printer chooses a different color profile.
This feature automatically chooses a color profile for
you when you print your file. This option is a good
one if you don’t have a custom profile for your
printer, ink, or paper.
• Photoshop Elements Manages Color: Elements per-
forms all color-management tasks when sending data
to the printer. This option is a good one if you have a
custom profile for a specific printer, ink, or paper.
Disable color management in the printer driver dia-
log box if you use this option. Select a printer profile
from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 15-6.
• No Color Management: Color isn’t managed. I don’t
recommend selecting this setting unless you have a
very good reason to do so.
3.
Click Printer Preferences to open the Page Setup dialog
box. Specify your settings the way you want.
4.
Keep the Rendering Intent option at the default setting
unless you have a very good reason to change to it. This
option specifies how colors are translated from your
photo’s color space when certain colors aren’t available
in the print space.
5.
Click Print.

Submit Files to a Service Provider
1.
Go online to check out which services your local service
provider offers. You may find info on pricing and file
specifications. Some offer downloadable resource files
and online ordering and uploading services.
2.
Before you submit a file to a service provider, know the
file specifications for your project. Know which file for-
mat, resolution, and color mode the provider prefers.
“Prepare Images for Printing,” earlier in this chapter has
more tips.
3.
After you find a good service provider, stick with it for
all your jobs. First, you know what to expect, and your
projects will be consistently produced. Second, by build-
ing a working relationship, you get good customer serv-
ice and secure a better negotiating position if another
provider comes in with a lower bid.
Order Prints Online
1.
In the Organizer, select the photos you want to order
prints for.
2.
Open the Share panel and click the Order Prints button.
3.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard appears, as shown in
Figure 15-15. Create an account and enter your order
information. You can order prints for yourself and send
prints to friends and family. Note that you can also
order prints from sites such as Snapfish and Shutterfly.
On a Mac, in Adobe Bridge, select a photo or photos, and choose
Tools➪Photoshop Services➪Online Photo Printing.
Service providers, or bureaus, are businesses that provide a variety of
services that can include photo processing, slide processing, printing,
mounting and lamination, scanning, image setting (color separations to
film and paper), digital printing, photo retouching and restoration, DVD
archving, and more. Providers normally offer services that you don’t
find at more copy-oriented centers, like FedEx Kinkos.
