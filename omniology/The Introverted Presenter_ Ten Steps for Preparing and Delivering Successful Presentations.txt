Introduction
If you bought this book for a presentation you need to give right now, go 
straight to Chapter 13 and come back here when it’s over.
For the rest of us who have more time, read on. 
There are those naturals. They always get asked to speak because they love 
it. Because they love it, they seek it, and because they seek it, they become 
better at it.
Then there are the rest of us. We hate the spotlight and run away from it.  
We never get asked because we never volunteer. We never volunteer because 
we don’t like it. So, we never improve. 
We just get very good at procrastination.
We put off speaking, and we put off anything about presenting. We put off 
writing the speech, we put off preparing the slides, and we put off rehearsals. 
And that makes us worse, which makes us hate it more.
This ends now. You may not like it, but you can do it. And if you do it, you may 
even come to like it.

Introverts and 
Presentations
Harnessing Terror
There are lots of presenting help books out there, so why should you read this 
one? If you too are an introvert, then this chapter explains why.
An introvert will always need support when making presentations. It’s simply 
not in our nature to stand in front of an audience and speak. We can do it, 
but it’s draining.
As you’ll see, Jung first named us introverts because we draw our energy from 
the outside inward. Pushing energy outward is just not in our nature, and while 
this book will teach you a process by which you can shine on the speaker’s 
platform, it will always leave you more exhausted than an extrovert.
The point is not to become an extrovert; that’s not possible. The point is 
to acknowledge our makeup and evolve accordingly. And one of the most 
important things for introverts to get right is the structure and content of the 
presentation.
An extrovert giving a badly structured presentation will not do well, and an 
introvert will do just as badly but will feel much worse when doing it. So, it’s 
much more important for an introvert to be well prepared. My promise to 
you is that if you follow the guidelines I have laid out here, you will make great 
presentations, and you’ll have fun doing it. By following the guidelines in this 
book, you will get better and better because you’ll understand what you’re 
good at and have coping strategies for what you’re not suited to do.

Here’s the alternative scenario. An accomplished professional speaker—let’s 
call him Dave—gives a great presentation at the company’s annual conference. 
Mary, a salesperson in the audience, admires his stage presence and wants to 
emulate him. She does a search online and—guess what!—Dave has written a 
“how-to” book sharing his personal secrets and tips for presenting. So, Mary 
buys it.
Late into the night she studies Dave’s secrets, puts all he says into practice, and 
discovers that it does not work for her.
The reason is simple: Dave is an extrovert. From an early age he has been 
the star of the show; he’s always the one who volunteers to be part of the 
nativity play, speech day, college debating society, and so on. That’s why he’s 
a presenter and speaker—he was born to do it. No matter how often Mary 
reads the book, she’s missing a vital part. Mary is an introvert so will still dread 
getting up to speak no matter how many books like Dave’s she reads.
The Introverted Presenter addresses this by leading you through the terror to 
a place of comfort and acceptance. Mary will never be a stand-up comic, but 
she can learn to present carefully prepared material her audience will connect 
with, and she can enjoy doing it.
I know this because I’m an introvert just like you.
About Me
When I was at school, about 13, I was asked to stand in front of the class and 
speak. My mystified classmates saw me standing, wordless. My vision went 
red and then green; next I passed out. Teenage boys are vicious in the face of 
weakness, but no one mentioned it, and I was never asked to stand and speak 
again. My limiting belief, established that day, was that I could never make a 
speech.
My career took me into theater, concert, and television production. Always 
backstage or behind the camera, I was privileged to work with some of the 
biggest names in the performing world. I watched the way great pop stars 
connected with their audience, learned from seeing one of our greatest actors 
rehearse one of his West End appearances, and enjoyed the seemingly end-
less rehearsals famous directors spent on small, important pieces of stage 
direction.
You could always spot me in the audience; I was the one spending only half 
my time watching the stage. I was looking to see how the performance was 
received, as well as the techniques of those on stage—all refreshingly nervous 
backstage.
I then worked in company events and corporate video. I found that I could 
help inexperienced presenters feel relaxed, hone their content, and become 
more effective. Over the years I got better and better at doing this. I have

worked with main board directors of more than 60 of the Fortune 100 com-
panies, as well as with leading charities and small Internet startups.
I have coached those making presentations in more than 30 countries, from 
a deserted Indonesian island to five-star conference centers and Buckingham 
Palace, from CEOs to disadvantaged children. I’m trained in neurolinguistic 
programming (NLP), theater, film, business, and mentoring.
About five years ago I started my own consultancy and needed to demon-
strate that I was an expert in the field. With a sinking heart, I realized that 
this meant I must volunteer to speak at industry events. I employed all that 
I had—unwittingly—learned through my career in the United Kingdom, in 
Europe, and further afield at more than 60 engagements globally. It worked.  
I proved what I’d always suspected: that to become successful in any field, you 
must be a confident speaker, and that my limiting belief was based in myth.  
I recognized myself as an introvert and trained myself to speak, and I’m now 
going to tell you how to as well.

Feared More 
Than Death
Destroying Some Myths
There’s a “survey” quoted by almost all presentation training companies. The 
gist of it is that when people are asked what they fear most, public speaking is 
the highest out of all the replies. It’s higher than death, which is number two. 
This supposedly academic piece of research is used by most trainers to say 
“At a funeral, would you really rather be in the coffin instead of reading the 
eulogy?” In fact, I can find no evidence that the survey really exists. There are 
a lot of these surveys that are regularly trotted out by professional speakers; 
most are pure invention, but they put some pseudo-academic veracity to a 
universal truth, usually the result of a dinner conversation made credible.
Before going further, I have to break some news to you: we are all going to 
die. As the Russians say, “Life is dangerous; no one has survived it yet.” So, if 
you ask what people most fear in their lives, death is kind of a given. No won-
der the fictitious respondents focus on the things that will happen before the 
inevitable.
The truth supported by this invention is that most people are afraid of stand-
ing up in public because most people are introverts. My Myers Briggs type is 
INFP. The important thing here is that the first letter is an I. The choice is I 
or E: introvert or extrovert. More than 50 percent of us are I. Sources differ 
in their percentages, but everyone agrees that more people are introverted 
rather than extroverted.

 The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed 
to measure preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. These preferences 
were extrapolated from the theories of Carl Jung first published in 1921.
Created by Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Meyers, the test was designed 
to help women entering work for the first time. The initial questionnaire grew into the Myers-
Briggs Type Indicator, which was first published in 1962.
CPP, Inc., the publisher of the MBTI instrument, calls it “the world’s most widely used personality 
assessment” with as many as 2 million assessments administered annually.
The test plots an individual’s preferences on four “dichotomies,” or preferences:
Extroversion (E) versus Introversion (I)
Sensing (S) versus Intuition (N)
Thinking (T) versus Feeling (F)
Judgment (J) versus Perception (P)
The four-letter Meyers Briggs types (intuition is represented by an N) are not indicators of 
aptitude, only preference. It’s easy to slip into some mistakes because, for example, if you were 
given a high judgment score, it does not mean you are necessarily judgmental.
When it comes to public speakers, such as the ones who are on TV night after 
night and the ones who earn the big bucks from their performances, they are 
mostly extroverts. They are the ones in short supply. It’s nothing more com-
plex than supply and demand. People who are good at public speaking are in 
the minority and therefore get well paid.
Those great speakers are genetically programmed to be good at it. At school 
they always took the lead in the play, they went on to college and chaired the 
debating society, everyone invites them to be the best man or woman at their 
wedding because the speeches are so amusing, at work they fly because they 
always look impressive when presenting, they are great salespeople, and they 
actively seek the limelight. We’ll have nothing to do with them because they 
are not like us. To perform the way they perform, we need different strategies 
and better support.
Yet we mere mortals look at an extrovert’s suave competence and expect to do 
the same. They don’t seem to prepare much, so we don’t; they tell jokes well, so 
we try to do the same; and they get applause, so we wonder why we don’t.

I’m doing alright for a bloke of my age, but I don’t try to compete against 
Olympic athletes, bodybuilders, or male models. I need a different strategy, 
and if you have picked up this book, you have recognized that you too need a 
different strategy to shine on the podium. You need a strategy suited to you, 
an introverted presenter.
Here’s the second bit of news: to give an effective presentation, you’ll have to 
expose a bit of yourself and give away a bit of your personality. We introverts 
hate that, but remember the last great talk you heard. The presenter didn’t 
just report the bare facts; the presenter made it personal. It was personal 
to the audience but also personal to their experience. Otherwise, it has no 
resonance. Think about why you went to the last performance you attended; 
it’s not because you wanted to hear a monotone rendition of your favorite 
text. It’s because you wanted to see a great interpretation of the work. I had 
an English teacher who made Shakespeare sound dull. I now realize that it’s 
because he was bored with teaching. I’m glad to say I’ve seen and worked with 
many actors who showed me how Shakespeare can sound interesting.
I think we can all acknowledge what actors are taught: that when an actor 
truly inhabits the emotions of the part, then the communication of the story 
becomes transcendental. If you think back to the last play, film, or TV show 
you saw, I bet you can’t remember every word of the script, but I bet you can 
remember how you felt at the end. In fact, there is recent research showing 
that audience members remember their feeling watching a performance and 
then adjust their memories of the production to make the memory match the 
emotion. It’s not the other way around.
One thing introverts hate is revealing their feelings to a large group. To be an 
effective presenter, you need to be prepared to reveal your feelings and to use 
them in making the speech. You’ll hate it, but it will work. I’ll let that thought 
settle with you as we work through the process, and I hope you won’t be too 
shocked when we get to that part.
Draw faith from the fact you have picked up this book and that you acknowl-
edge who and what you are. Trust that I have managed to give effective pre-
sentations on many occasions despite being—just like you—an introvert and 
that there are many ways you can shine when you deliver using the kind of 
preparation I can tell you about.
Let’s get started. The next chapter takes you on the first step in the method I 
have developed to prepare presentations you can enjoy giving.
Before you turn the page, if you want, take a look at IntrovertedPreseter.com, 
where I have put a page of links to examples of great presentations, and look 
at the Introverted Presenter Facebook pages. Take a look at the links to TED.
com, which contains some of the most inspiring presentations I have seen. 
The presentations I have chosen are all examples of how introverts can shine

through clarity and preparation. Beware that once you take a look at TED.com, 
you may never escape!
MARY’S JOURNEY BEGINS: THE INITIAL PANIC
Mary had just been promoted to the giddy heights of submanager in the Financial 
Services Company where she has worked for three years. From her slightly bigger 
desk, she can actually see daylight at times; she has an assistant for the first time in her 
life and struggles to find enough things for her to do.
It’s Tuesday morning, and her manager tells her about the association conference in 
Birmingham. The event contains a number of presentations by individual companies 
reviewing developments in the past year. Traditionally these presentations have been 
made by staff at Mary’s level. Her predecessor always gave great presentations. Would 
Mary have her presentation slides on his desk in ten days?
Mary starts to panic. She didn’t realize that her new post meant she’d have to give 
speeches!
The rest of Tuesday and Wednesday go by in a blur. Yes, she’s doing all the things 
she’s paid to do but in a disengaged manner. Her every moment is filled with the desire 
to not think about the speech. She hates giving presentations and would certainly not 
have accepted the promotion if she’d known. No one at work can know how much she’s 
panicking.
Wednesday evening comes, and she’s meeting some friends from college. The stress 
is starting to get to her. She drinks too much and indulges in a little alcohol-fuelled 
honesty.
Thursday morning arrives, and through a searing headache Mary sees an e-mail from 
one friend who was at the pub the night before. Mike was also afraid to give presentations, 
and he too was held back in his career, so he offers to help her. Oh, and he promises to 
keep what she’d like to do to Ryan Gosling to himself.
The first step, Mike tells Mary, is to understand that she can do this. She has an above-
average intelligence, and lots of people get through presentations without disaster 
occurring, even if they are not “natural” speakers. It may not be her favorite thing to do, 
but she does lots of things she does not like. The first thing is to accept that she’s going 
to give this presentation and that she needs to use all her skills to prepare. Ignoring it is 
not an option and will only make it worse. Mike promises to be in touch in a few days to 
ask her about what she has to do.
Immediately Mary feels less anxious. There’s now a date when she will deal with the 
presentation, and she feels there’s nothing to be done right away. While she’s still scared, 
she takes solace from the knowledge that Mike has faced this devil and survived. In the 
following days, she is at least able to cope with the other parts of her workload and 
actually think about something other than her impending doom.

Your Objective
The First Step
I’m assuming you are reading this book because you have a presentation in 
mind. If you follow my method, it will also set the template to allow you to not 
just give one great presentation but also follow a path with a set of tools that 
allow you to shine in the future. Each time you use this process you will build 
on the time before. The first step on that journey is your presentation that 
we will work through together—the one that’s on your mind right now. This 
is the start of the process I use every time I give a presentation. If I am feeling 
over-confident or, worse, lazy, I occasionally skip a step. It always comes back 
to haunt me later. So, here is step 1.
Step 1: Define Your Audience
I want you to start preparing yourself by thinking about the event and your 
audience. Write down (I know, it’s not very cool, and you don’t want someone 
coming across your notes, but just do it because this is important) everything 
you know about the audience you will be presenting to. Write down the 
age range, the demographics, whether they are known to you, how they can 
influence your future, how much they earn, how much you care about them, 
everything. If you’re not sure, make your best guess. It’s just between you and 
a piece of paper you are going to eat soon anyway.
Once you have defined everything you know about the audience, then ask 
this question: what state is your audience in when you think about your pre-
sentation? What I mean is, what is their knowledge, emotional attachment, 
and attitude? For example, how would you rate them in knowledge, positivity, 
motivation, and openness?

I was once asked to advise one of the U.K. utility companies on making its 
presentations more creative. When I examined the personality traits of the 
group I was working with, I realized that in a heavily regulated environment 
the recruitment function effectively screened out anyone who might have 
wanted to think outside a very limited brief. These people essentially wanted 
to be told what to do. So, my client did just that. To treat them any other 
way would have required a lot more time and—I believe—would have been 
unpleasant for them and unproductive for the speaker. Know your audience, 
and always respect who and where they are.
These two statements of your audience—description and state—are separate 
and important pieces of information. Keep them in mind because I’ll be refer-
ring to them throughout the process. The information is important in terms 
of content, whether we need to persuade or inform, and in terms of tone; you 
would not speak to your child the same way you might speak to your boss. 
For now we are going to focus on the first use for the information.
Now that you know all you can know about the audience you will be facing, 
answer this question: what do you want your audience to do once your pre-
sentation is over? Get that clear in your mind.
There are lots of things in the way of this clarity, and what gets in the way here 
is why you have been asked to speak. For example, it may be a speech that 
your boss gave last year, and now he can’t be bothered to repeat the process, 
so you have to do it. But whatever the reason for you being lumbered with 
this task and whatever the reason for this audience being assembled in front 
of you, I want you to put that out of your mind when considering how you 
want this audience to behave. The reason you are there is irrelevant, truly.
There is only one thing that matters at this point in the process of making 
you a happy presenter. What can this group of individuals do for you? This 
thinking is often called zero-base planning, and it’s useful in a lot of business 
process reengineering. We essentially ask the question, “If I had to start from 
nothing, what would I do?” I’m sure you can think of instances where business 
decisions are made on the basis of previous experience plus inflation, or some 
other adjustment.
So, to bring it back to your presentation, the worst thing you can do is a DILLY. 
Some years ago I was working with a lighting designer called Gus Stewart 
on an annual conference for an IT multinational company. I was explaining 
the requirements of the meeting, and he said, “So, it’s a DILLY job?” It was an 
expression I’d never heard before, so Gus had to explain. “Do. It. Like. Last. 
Year.”
DILLY should be something you avoid at all costs. If you find yourself referenc-
ing the last time this presentation slot was filled, you will produce something 
that is boring and repetitive.

The Introverted Presenter
11
The audience you have can do something for you. This is what a presentation 
is all about. It is your chance to ask and influence them to take action. What 
is the most useful thing they can do for you? Think long and hard about this; 
it’s your golden opportunity.
Be really specific. What do you want your audience to do specifically, in what 
timescale? What exact action? How often? To whom? Write this down sev-
eral times, refining each time you do. Your objective is to reduce the action 
you desire to a really pithy statement that will fit on a sticky note; it will fit if 
you are specific enough. Finally, make a neat version you can place somewhere 
within clear sight while we finish the process of preparing your presentation. 
This action statement is a vital part of our progress.
Now go to bed.
In the morning, if you spot any generalization in your sticky note, then you 
need to do more work. For example, “To engender a positive image for the 
project among the wider stakeholders” will not do. What we are looking for 
is “More than 50 percent of the audience to contact us for a quote within  
14 days.” See what I mean? Specific.
Because we are introverts, there’s a mechanism that seems to kick in regularly. 
As any step in the process becomes tricky, we start to question why it’s us 
giving the presentation. Your mind is working overtime trying to find reasons 
why Sally from account management should be speaking in your place. This 
is a completely understandable defense mechanism. Understandable as it may 
be, the effect is to divert you from focusing on step of the process we are 
working with and send your mind on great loops of logic. I have constructed 
my process to make each part a small step that you can focus on to the exclu-
sion of others. So, keep your head down, and don’t let diversions interrupt the 
process. I know it works, and for now I just need you to trust.
I assure you this is the foundation for everything we are going to do together. 
It’s as important as the foundation of the house you live in. It’s never thought 
about after the building work is completed, yet it has a vital influence on your 
future well-being. So, go around this many times. Talk to anyone you can make 
sit still (buying drinks works well) and bore everyone to death with this until 
you feel you have a really concise action that your audience will be able to take 
in the time while they still remember you.
Having written the end objective for the presentation, the next stage is to 
move to a draft of the written text, and there are two steps to take to make 
you able to do that, which I’ll cover in the next two chapters.

MARY FINDS HER FOCUS: IT’S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW
Three days later, and Mary’s inbox makes that irritating “ping” noise: there’s Mike. “Have 
not forgotten about you—tell me about this presentation.”
“Oh, it’s terrible,” she writes, “25 minutes in front of the big-wigs from all the companies 
in our sector, and I have to say what I’ve done that is innovative…and I have not done 
anything innovative at all.”
“Calm down,” replies Mike, “you don’t have to say what they tell you to say, and I’m sure 
you’ve done more than you think you have. Tell me all about it.”
Mary spends the next 45 minutes writing, rewriting, editing, and thinking of more things 
to say. At the end she has written five pages of notes on the event, the reason she’s 
there, the great slides her predecessor used, and how much she hates even the thought 
of doing it.
Mike replies, offering to meet her for a coffee the next day. In the meantime, he asks her 
to think about what she wants from the presentation and how she wants it to go—“…
and being sick so you can’t attend isn’t an option.”
After another sleepless night, Mary turns up looking less than perky.
“So, what have you discovered?” asks Mike.
“That I haven’t got a clue, that I’m going to look awful, that I wish I could go back to my 
last job where I didn’t earn as much money but didn’t spend so much on trying to look 
perfect, and that this presentation is going to cost me a fortune in new clothes,” Mary 
wailed into her latte.
Mike took a look at her notes. “It seems to me there’s a lot of stuff in here that isn’t really 
where you need to apply your mind at the moment. These are all important things to 
consider, but you need to decide what’s important right now.”
“Slides?” Mary asks.
“Not really,” explains Mike. He takes a highlighter pen and starts scribbling on the notes. 
“I think there are two things to think about first: the people you’ll be talking to and what 
you want from them.” From these notes it seems to me that you have an opportunity to 
promote yourself to the other companies in your business, so that’s personal networking, 
and you have an opportunity to sell your company’s expertise, which might lead to some 
cross-industry sales. I think you have a personal objective and a corporate one.”
They spent the next ten minutes arguing about all the other things that Mary felt were 
important. The majority of this time was spent on the slides. She had seen the slides 
her predecessor had used the previous year; Mary wanted slides that were impressive, 
but Mike was implacable. He gently persuaded Mary to focus on the objective of her 
presentation. Mike then asked her to write the five steps that led from her audience not 
knowing anything about her to understanding Mary’s objective.

“Sorry, Mary, look at the time. I’ve got to dash. Catch you later,” and he was gone.
Mary walked slowly back to the office mulling over what they’d discussed. She still 
wasn’t sure Mike had the answers, but he surely had more of a clue than she did.
At her desk an e-mail popped up:
Mare
Sorry I had to leave.
Write those steps down and let’s talk again.
            M x
That night she slept well for the first time since being given the task. She felt she was 
not alone in this and someone was pointing her in the right direction.

Presentation 
Structure
Building Your Road Map
Having established the action your audience should take at the end of your 
presentation, you now have a destination for your speech. It’s a bit like ­driving 
a car; if we simply took the most attractive turn at each junction, we would 
never reach a chosen destination. You now have a way to structure the  
presentation that will make your audience feel confident that you know what 
you’re doing. Because you do.
The story you are about to tell needs a start (where the audience is right now) 
and an end (your destination). When I asked you to define your ­audience, 
I also asked where they were in relation to your topic.
To recap, the definition of your audience defines the tone of your presen-
tation, and the definition of their state is going to help us structure the 
presentation.
It’s a journey from where the audience might be at the moment to where you 
want them to be in order to take the action you are demanding at the end 
of your presentation. There are two ways to do this: the lecture way and the 
story way. I’ll describe the lecture way first.
When I call a structure the lecture version, it’s because this is the structure 
used in—naturally—most teaching environments, and it is the structure of 
almost every training package I’ve seen. A bit like a game of chess, it’s simple 
to describe, yet you can spend a lifetime learning how to use all the possible 
permutations available.

Chapter 4 | Presentation Structure
16
There’s a well-known show business adage called the rule of three. Stand-up 
comics will always put their weakest joke at the end of a group of three 
because if you tell three jokes in a row, the last one will always get the biggest 
laugh; politicians deliver their statements in groups of three in the knowledge 
that the third statement will get the round of applause. You can find groups 
of three in Shakespeare, Moliere, and even the Bible. It’s a powerful way to 
communicate.
Simply write three statements that take your audience from where they are 
at the moment to where you want them to be; then for each of the three 
points, make three subpoints. Now your structure is as follows: at the begin-
ning of your presentation, you simply tell the audience a brief version of the 
three things you are going to tell them, then you go through all three in detail 
illustrating with the three subpoints, and finally you end by reviewing the three 
points and concluding with your “what to do” statement.
It’s often described as tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and 
then tell them what you told them. It sounds a bit bald when described the 
way I’ve done here, but with a bit of subtlety it is effective and might be right 
for you.
The story version is a different way to approach a presentation and might be 
more appropriate for your needs. The story method is, um, a story. Humans 
are made to tell one another stories; it’s what we do in the playground, it’s 
what we do around the watercooler, it’s what we do at home, and it’s what 
we do to attract and keep a mate. It’s sometimes more difficult to make a 
presentation work this way, but if you can, the emotional attachment is much 
greater because your audience will feel you have shared a little of yourself in 
the process. As introverts, we therefore steer away from this on the platform, 
but since we actually would communicate this way in other situations, it can 
be a way for an introvert to shine.
The tricky part is finding the right story. You are looking for as personal a tale 
as possible, which again takes the audience through the journey from where 
they are at the moment to the action you want them to take. We introverts 
tend to steer away from personal revelation, but once we’ve turned that ­corner, 
you will find that telling the story is actually easier than delivering a lecture. 
This is because it’s a personal story, and we never have trouble answering 
questions like “How was your journey?” or “Did you find us alright?” We are 
also less likely to forget where we are in the story because it’s obvious and 
sequential. So, take some time to consider all the options.
Either way, the step you need to complete is finding the logical sequence of 
steps that take you from the beginning of your presentation to the end action 
statement. Whichever you choose, write it down before we move on to the 
next step.

The Introverted Presenter

Some years ago I was trying to sell a historical documentary to a U.K. broad-
caster. The broadcaster didn’t seem interested, so my pitch was clearly not 
perfect. In expressing my frustration, I spoke to a screenwriting friend. I 
explained that I was really fired up about this fantastic story and could not 
understand why the commissioning editor at the broadcaster did not share 
my enthusiasm. The screenwriter responded by suggesting that instead of 
making a historical documentary, I should propose a historical drama. Dramas 
are much more expensive (around five times the cost), but they generate a 
much larger audience (about 20 times if you get it right), and therefore the 
broadcaster might be prepared to stump up for that. The broadcaster didn’t 
like that idea either, but I realized that particularly when dealing with material 
that is not very visual, a re-creation would be much more engaging. It would 
then become a personal story. That started me thinking about movies I have 
enjoyed that bring the past to life through telling personal stories. Personal 
stories are much more engaging than a text book, which is why I urge you to 
take the story route if you possibly can.
In the same way, it’s difficult to explain in a presentation the ins and outs of a 
pensions fund, a research project, or anything intangible in nature, so in those 
cases, a personal story of the effect of the thing you are trying to illustrate is 
much more accessible than a dry list of facts.
Also, we should consider what makes a “good” presentation. Some think 
that the end of a good speech is when everyone in the audience nods sagely, 
strokes their chins, and makes their way to the coffee break in an orderly 
manner. I disagree. I think the end of a great presentation is when a substantial 
number of the audience members rush the stage demanding more informa-
tion or taking issue with something the speaker has said.
Is this something introverts actively seek out? You bet we don’t. We want 
everything nice and calm and nonconfrontational. But for the purposes of cre-
ating your presentation, I suggest you consider being just a bit provocative—
something we’ll come to in the next chapter—and that you think more about 
your “what I want them to do” statement that is the end of your script.
Let’s consider for a moment what presentations are good at and what they 
do badly. When you see a presentation, you get a sense of who the person 
is, what they believe in, and how they view the world. What they do badly is 
to convey specific facts (unless there’s only one of them) and convey dense 
information. What presentations are great at is conveying enthusiasm and 
putting your audience in the mood to find out more. So, do use this part of 
the process to identify links you can use to resources online that can back up 
your presentation. You can put these links in a handout, on your profile in the 
program, or on material in the reception and catering areas. This is one way 
to lengthen the life span of your message.

Chapter 4 | Presentation Structure

Incidentally, you might be able to hire someone else to write the presenta-
tion for you. If you do that, you still need to go through the process up to this 
point before you are in a position to brief a writer. A good writer, and there 
are some very good ones, cannot tell you what story you want to tell or what 
you want the audience to do at the end of your presentation. They all have 
strategies both subtle and overt to extract the information from you. The end 
result will be only as good as your brief, and up to this point all we’ve been 
defining the parameters of the presentation. In the next chapter, we’ll look at 
the work of writing your presentation—assuming that you are going to do it 
yourself.
MARY STARTS TO FEEL IN CONTROL: GENTLE STEPS
Mary arrived at work the next day to another e-mail from Mike:
M. Where is it?
M
Cheeky Bugger she thought, but actually when she started writing, Mary found the 
words flowed easily. Within ten minutes she had an outline written and pinged back to 
Mike. She turned to the rest of her work without giving the presentation another thought 
for the next three hours.
After lunch there was a call. “Well done for doing that,” Mike said, “but I don’t think it’s 
quite there.” Mary fumed.
“But I thought that was what you wanted?”
“Well, it’s the first step in what I wanted, but it doesn’t really tell the story,” said Mike. 
“Take another look at it and tell me what you think.” Mary sat and ground her teeth for a 
while, and then she took a deep breath.
Mary printed out the list and read it again. She went to fetch a drink and read it some 
more, and then she started jotting notes on it. After 20 minutes she had a paper covered 
in scribbles, so she turned back to her computer and made a tidy version. She e-mailed 
it to Mike with a sarcastic comment about dictators, perfectionists, and whether Mike’s 
parents were actually married when they had him.
An e-mail pinged back:
Pino Grigio? 6:30? M

In the wine bar, Mary sipped her “attitude adjustor” as Mike looked over the new list. 
Then he put it to one side and—shouting over the music of Rihanna—said, “Why don’t 
you just tell me what this is really about?” Mary replied in three short sentences. Mike 
made notes. He passed the paper back to her. “There’s your outline. It’s a story now. 
Another glass, or shall we get a bottle?”
Mike. Don’t do that again. Thanks for the advice. My head hurts.

Mary struggled through the next morning, and when she finally got around to the  
wine-stained piece of paper, she had difficulty making it all out, so she wrote up 
what she could understand and made up the rest. Then she rewrote the story of her 
presentation. Small parts of it started to sound like actual words a real speaker might 
use. She e-mailed the result to Mike and headed out to lunch with some work friends.

Writing Your 
Speech
The Work Can Begin
So, now you have it: a concise objective written on a sticky note and stuck 
where you can’t fail to see it. Now it’s time to write a script.
“What?”
Yes. Write a script.
“But I thought you did the slides first!”
Nope. Write a script. We will certainly come to slides in due course. But they 
come later; you may ask why.
“OK, why?
Well, slides are there to illustrate what you are trying to communicate, and 
indeed they have a big influence on how you are remembered. But they are 
support for your message. They are not the message.
“But Bill from accounts had great slides at the last company event.”
Yes, he did, and you’ll have great slides too; we’re just not going to work on 
them now. At this point (and indeed every other point), introverts like to 
indulge in diversion activity because they rightly fear that actually writing the 
script will reveal something about themselves. They are right; it does. But 
(imagine Simon Cowell speaking here), you know what? That’s what your 
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 5 | Writing Your Speech
22
audience showed up for. You. So, if you are going to reveal something about 
yourself, let’s do it here where it’s nice and safe with time to edit and adjust 
before we get to displaying it in all its glory in public. Yes, I know you were 
scared when I said the P word.
It’s all about you and your words. So, let’s take a little diversion before  
doing that.
“Thank you, I was looking for a little diversion.”
I know. I was too.
When actors study at drama school, they spend a lot of time on their physical 
fitness because standing up in public is stressful. That’s also why theater man-
agement spends so much money backstage on wardrobe care and remakes. 
Even the most professional accomplished actor leaves the stage drenched in 
sweat. Sorry, but it’s true.
The reason is that they put everything into their performance; they focus on 
every nuance of the text to produce the best response they can get from 
their audience. So you, and I, who are unnatural performers, will be in a state 
of panic when we present. We will need every ounce of brain power just  
to stay upright speaking coherently. I don’t mean to add to your panic,  
but that’s the reality. So, you need everything that can be taken care of to  
be put in place before you reach the podium. This is my aim in taking you 
through this process: to be as calm as you can be under fire. Note the “as you 
can be” part.
That’s why we take time here to get everything as well prepared as it can be.
“But how will I remember the script?”
Don’t worry about that now. Just write the damn thing. OK, I have one more 
diversion for you before you start work.
“Thank you.”
You’re welcome.
When I was at film school, one of my tutors was Michael Bukht, who was also 
known as Michael Barry, the Crafty Cook, on radio and television in the UK; if 
you’re older than 40, you might remember him. He taught me all I needed to 
know about writing for speech, which is different from writing anything else. 
As Michael said, “Sentences without verbs, OK!”
In fact, Michael didn’t write his scripts; he dictated them to a secretary  
(remember them?) so he wasn’t hung up by how the words looked on the 
page. If you want to emulate him, use a Dictaphone and then transcribe your 
own words. Almost any phone can do this now.

The Introverted Presenter
23
As a fledgling TV producer, one of the first jobs I was given was transcrib-
ing interviews before edits. I had to write down exactly what an interviewee 
said—not what they meant, what they said. We needed to know which words 
we had captured and could use in the edit. In transcribing these words, I saw 
how inaccurately we all use words, and even my basic knowledge of grammar 
was outraged by how blatant the mistakes looked when they were written 
on paper.
Try this for yourself. Go out for drinks with friends and listen. Really listen 
to what they literally say. As the evening goes on (and they drink more), 
the amount of grammatically inaccurate stuff that comes out of their mouths 
is fantastic. But we all understand what our mates are saying, so what’s the 
problem?
The problem is lawyer-speak, which is taking over our lives. This is a bête 
noir of mine, so excuse me if I rant a bit here. Look at any sign anywhere, 
and you’ll find it’s not as we speak; it’s how company lawyers try to mitigate 
liability. “Management are not responsible for damage occurring to private 
property residing in this storage facility” is not how we speak to one another 
as sentient human beings, and yet this kind of vocabulary and sentence  
construction is creeping into our lives. And guess who is leading the standard 
for lawyer-speak into battle? That’s right, us introverts. We need to overcome 
our natural tendencies. Introverts like to hide behind conditions. We don’t 
like confrontation, and speaking plainly can feel like that. Here’s a chance to 
put all that behind you.
Finally, remember this is only the first draft. Once you have produced some 
text, we are going to spend some time working on it, refining it, and making it 
the best script you can have. So, don’t worry that these words are going to be 
exactly what you will say. It will be much better than that.
Enough diversions. Here’s exactly what we will do. First open your word pro-
cessor on your computer and write the words on which you are going to 
end—your action statement at the end of the document. In front of that you 
are going to write your script with the knowledge of exactly where you are 
going.
Whichever structure you decided on in the previous chapter goes in front of 
this. Now you have a full presentation; it’s just lacking the words you will actu-
ally say. If you feel confident, just start writing those words in right away; if you 
are a little hesitant—as we introverts are—then a technique I use is to take 
each part of the structure and turn that into a longer sentence and then take 
each of those sentences and make them three sentences, and so on, until you 
have all the information you require in place.
Do it quickly and don’t think about it too much. We are attempting to get a 
first full draft down on paper in a way that we can work with it as we move 
toward your presentation. Once you have something written, we can begin 

Chapter 5 | Writing Your Speech
24
the process of improving and refining it. I have known brilliant writers who 
can put 95 percent of the finished presentation down at this stage, and I have 
known situations where not one word of the first draft was in the final deliv-
ered speech.
And unless you think this is because you are inexperienced, I once had the 
privilege of speaking with Randy Nelson at Pixar. He told me that when they 
were producing Finding Nemo, the company and its artistic director John 
Lassiter spent five years refining the script for the movie before they com-
menced production. They believed that they had the perfect story laid out in 
the best possible way so that production would be a simple process of letting 
their brilliant animators put the images on the screen. Randy’s guess was that 
only 20 percent of that original script actually ended up in the movie. This is 
because Pixar has the most impressive system for refining and improving its 
productions that results in its enviable cabinet full of Oscars and a hit rate 
of box-office successes that outshines anyone in Hollywood. So, if it’s good 
enough for animated fish that earn millions of dollars worldwide, then it’s 
good enough for you.
If you still need another diversion, I recommend timetowrite.com written by 
Jurgen Wolff who has lots of advice on writing, and also you can spend time 
signing up for his newsletter, which allows you to spend more time download-
ing his “overcome procrastination” report, which is something to do instead 
of facing up to the writing you have to do now.
I mean it. Now.
MARY GETS SCARED AGAIN: DON’T LOSE FAITH
Lunch was a sandwich in the local park. Mary’s friends asked about the presentation: 
wasn’t she scared? She admitted she was a little more than frightened and told them 
of Mike’s help. “Who’s Mike?” they all asked. “He works nearby, and he was in my class 
at college.”
“He seems to be helping a lot.”
“Yes, he is.”
“So, he just happens to be nearby? He just happens to be helpful?”
“What?”
“Just saying.”
Back at the office Mary looks at her outline again and starts doodling on the sheet. She 
starts drawing pictures that might be slides. The phone rings; it’s Mike. He asks how she 
feels about writing the speech now. Mary is panicked.

The Introverted Presenter
25
“What? I don’t need to write a script, do I? The outline is OK. I can just talk around the 
subject. I’ve started on my slides.”
“You need to write a script, and I’ll tell you how. I can explain why, but it’s better to see 
what I mean. What are you doing this evening? Fancy seeing a movie?”
Mary is confused but flattered by the attention. “How will that help?”
“You’ll be inspired by the way professional storytellers work.”
The next morning she composes an e-mail:
Mike
That was a lovely evening, but I don’t see how a story of a love affair 
in the 1920s helps me sell financial services. What do I do with the 
presentation outline now?
Great Italian by the way…
M xoxo
Mike was quick to respond:
Mare
Italian’s new, thanks for the chance to try it.
Take your presentation outline and do the speech that goes with it. Just 
this time, you are writing it down, not saying it out loud. If you want to 
be calm and collected by the time you get to the podium, then you need 
to plan everything in advance. The structure is there; now you need the 
actual words.
The movie was to show you how stories engage audiences; you gave it 
your full attention. I was looking.
You are speaking for 25 mins, so you want to end up with about 2,300 
to 2,500 words. Look at the bottom bar in Word, and you’ll see the word 
count. Just write as if you were speaking; no need to follow the rules. 
Because you have the outline, writing the script shouldn’t take you more 
than a couple of hours. Call me if you get stuck.
M x
Mary took a deep breath and started. She was fairly good at allowing herself to be 
distracted at every moment, but then 5 p.m. arrived, and she decided to finish before 
she left. At 7 p.m. she left the office sending Mike a text:
Phew. Done. Hot bath and a glass.

Refining
Letting It Shine
Those great extroverts seem to just pop up on stage and speak fluently,  
without any preparation. We can do that too, right? Wrong. Let’s take another 
little diversion.
Before turning to presentation coaching, I ran a creativity company and 
coached communicators to expand their creativity. I established the route 
that most creative people take to come up with new ideas. As part of refining 
the description of this process so that anyone could use it, I tested my theory 
on a few designers I hold in high regard. Most of them denied that they had a 
process; they just came up with ideas there and then. However, in observing 
them at work, I could clearly see that they did have a process, but it was a pro-
cess that happened so quickly they were unaware of even going through it.
When we learn to drive (bear with me here), we go through Maslov’s levels of 
competency. We start off as unconscious incompetent (what’s a car?), become 
conscious competent (that’s a car, and I can’t drive it), then conscious com-
petent (that’s a car, and I’ve learned to drive), and finally end up unconscious 
competent (where shall we go for lunch?). I tried to teach my daughter to 
drive (one of the scariest things I have ever done) and had to remember how 
I drove a car because for several decades I had not had to think about it at 
all. As a result, I was driving terribly. Once we are competent as experienced 
presenters are, we can do things without apparently needing to think about 
them at all.
Diversion over. Those extrovert presenters we see and admire do prepare 
for each and every speech they make. But the preparation can take seconds 
because they’ve spent their entire lives in preparation. You and I need more 
deliberate action.
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 6 | Refining
28
Rehearsal. Preparation is not only cool; for us introverts it’s vital.
By now you should have a clear objective and a written text that we are going 
to refine by rehearsal. First, read your script out loud as many times as you 
need. Notice the phrases that trip you up and change them; simple repetition 
will make you aware of the weaknesses in your text. Once you have done this 
several times (and “several” will vary depending on your personal aptitude), 
you’ll know when you’ve done this enough when you start to get bored.
Then it’s time to look at what you are doing.
Stand up, and do the same thing but this time in front of a mirror. I told you 
we’d do this in small steps that introverts can cope with, but for many of 
my clients this is the most difficult step. Therefore, you are likely to skip it, 
but at that point I must become a bit of a drill sargeant about it. Get up! 
Do it now!
Let’s take a little diversion while you reel from my sudden transformation.
If you’ve been following my advice, you have read the script out loud several 
times, so all I’m now asking you to do is the same thing but standing up and 
looking at yourself in a mirror. For a long time I was confused as to why this 
step seemed to be the most traumatic. I personally find the next step more of 
a problem, but that’s just me, so don’t worry about it for now.
Then I realized the truth thanks to the insight of one of my clients: she told 
me that the moment she stood up and looked in the mirror she realized that 
on the day she would be standing up and other people would be looking at 
her. That was the thing she was most scared about. Delivering the text was 
not what concerned her; other people judging what she delivered was what 
worried her.
Just remember I’m taking you by the hand here and leading you through the 
process one only slightly scary step at a time. See how I play both good and 
bad cop here?
My client’s solution—once we had the insight—was that before she did the 
mirror thing, she put on the full war paint and dressed in her best power 
clothing. She realized that when we do these exercises in the privacy of our 
own environment, we are probably at our slobby worst. I’m writing this in the 
kitchen because it’s the warmest room in the house and dressed for comfort, 
not glamour. Well, you would do that too, wouldn’t you?
Using whatever technique you need to make it happen, read the script in front 
of a mirror and watch how you look doing it. Again, whenever you see or hear 
something that grates, change it to improve it.
You may also find that in the course of these exercises you want to change 
the end statement. It’s not cast in stone. If you can say it better—or shorter, 

The Introverted Presenter
29
which is the same thing—then do so. Your mental attitude should be that in 
this phase we are in the lab (so to speak), and anything is admissible so long as 
it improves the presentation.
With this constant repetition you start to notice things about your text. These 
are things that might make you want to expand or contract whole sections. 
So, let’s take another diversion from your rehearsals.
Back to the script. You thought I’d forgotten about that? All this repetition 
and constant improvement should now have produced something that is a 
quantum level above your first draft. It will be something that engages person-
ally, something you now know by heart, and something to which an audience 
can connect—and you don’t mind them doing that.
Keep up the repetition.
MARY EMBRACES PANIC: IT’S OK TO BE NERVOUS
When Mary arrived at work the next day, she found an e-mail hiding among the early 
morning spam. It was from her boss.
Mary
Don’t forget to include references to the company history, recent 
business wins, and future potential for mergers. It’s important to 
name our influential business partners. Can you send your slides over 
ASAP?
George
She panicked and called Mike, who told her not to worry. “I’ll have to rewrite it, and I 
need to do the slides this morning,” she wailed. Mike advised her to spend one hour 
working on the things she was supposed to be doing. Don’t do this now; call me when 
you have done all your other immediate and urgent work for the morning, and then get 
a coffee and call me again.
She called back 90 minutes later. Mike was in a meeting, and he returned her call at 
11:30.
“Mike, I’ve been working on the new presentation slides for quite a while, but it’s all so 
boring. I’m starting to panic again. What do I do now?”
“Well, to start with, stop working on the slides. Let’s go back to the outline.”
“But… but…”
“Outline. Mary, you are a long way down the road with this presentation, and just like 
with a journey, if you have to include some extra stops, it would be foolish to drive back 
to the start point before planning a new route. Now, first question: why is George trying 
to control you like this?”

Chapter 6 | Refining
30
“Well, um, he’s my boss, so it is his job to control me.”
“OK. So, do the things he’s asking for actually fit into your outline?”
“Well, I’ve kind of covered the history, I didn’t want to over-promise on the future, and the 
current business partners are in there but not named.”
“Have you told George about your presentation?”
“No, but why can’t I just make the slides and keep him happy?”
“We are nearly at the slide-making stage, but how about this: reply to George telling him 
how you’ve already included some of what he’s asked for. You are going to tweak the 
presentation, and when you are ready, you will present to him, and he can see if there’s 
any need for further feedback.”
“God, I couldn’t present to him!”
“I’ve got bad news for you, Mary; you are going to give this presentation in front of more 
than 500 people, and I’m going to suggest you rehearse it several times before then, 
and I think it will do you good to run through it in front of George; plus, he’s your boss. 
He deserves to see it and have the opportunity to comment.”
“Shit.”
“Well, yes, but don’t allow this to derail you from the process because…”
“Process? There’s a process?”
“Well, yes, I was kind of leading you through it, but there is a process, and if you trust 
the process, I can assure you it will all turn out fine. Now just fob George off for a while 
and get back on track.”
“But he wants slides.”
“He wants to know he will get slides. And he will. But some people use the word slides 
when they mean speech, and the speech is mostly about you, not about the slides. So, 
tell him you’ll give him the speech when it’s ready for his comments.”
“But he wants slides.”
“Just try it. See what happens. What’s the worst that can happen? I’ve got to go. Sorry, 
call me later if he comes back for more.”

Dear George
I’m working through the presentation and will have my slides ready in a 
few days. I’d be glad if you could hear the whole thing and give me your 
feedback at that time.
KR
Mary
So, Mary went back to the document she’d been working on with Mike and persevered. 
She kept doodling her ideas for slides in the margin as she thought they would be 
useful. Surely Mike doesn’t know everything?
Long into the evening she worked.
At 8:15 there was a knock on her office door.
It was Mike with sandwiches and a bottle of wine.
“How did you…?”
“The light was on. I can see you from across the street.”
“Are you…?”
“Stalking you?”
“Are you?”
“Well…sort of. I was visiting friends who live across the street and…”
“Rich friends!”
“Is your script ready?”
“Well…”
“Show me; you’ve got to show someone.”
And so Mary opened the wine and showed Mike the pages she’d written so far. He 
glanced at them and put them back on her desk.
“I’m not going to read it.”
“What?”
“I want you to read it to me.”
“Bugger off.”

Chapter 6 | Refining
32
But eventually Mike prevailed. Mary read the text. And when she read, she found the 
things she thought would work didn’t, and some of the things she thought would not 
work did. Every time she read it Mike suggested things to change. Every time she read 
it her words sounded better, but Mary was unsure whether it was the improvement in the 
text or the level of the bottle making the improvements.
Just before 11 they left. As they parted, Mary kissed Mike goodbye, for the first time.
“I wouldn’t have got this far without you.”
“Still a way to go, “ he replied. “Talk tomorrow?”
They both went slowly home. Mary didn’t sleep a wink.

Presenting Tips
Good to Great
Now it’s time to apply those tricks of the trade, in other words, things that 
ramp up your presentation still further. Incidentally, all those other books writ-
ten by extroverts—for extroverts—start here. This is about stage techniques 
that we introverts can apply only after we’ve done the solid foundation work 
of the previous steps in the process. Let’s take the actions in the sequence 
they will happen on the big day.
To start, in all likelihood you will be introduced at the beginning of your pre-
sentation. If you do nothing about this, the chairperson of the meeting will 
probably read your profile in the meeting program, or worse they will make 
something up. Don’t let this happen. We can all be described in many ways, 
and what matters to you now is that aspect of your character that supports 
your end “What do I want them to do?” statement. Construct an introduction 
that supports that statement to make yourself the person who is able and 
credible in asking for that action.
I was working with Microsoft a few years ago and saw a presentation by 
a company trying to sell IT to the U.K. police force. I heard an interesting 
grading system that I was told most police forces use. It’s called five by five 
(Figure 7-1), and this knowledge changed how I look at the world—so much 
so that I rushed the stage to learn more!

Chapter 7 | Presenting Tips

Five by five judges information on two axes, each on a scale of—you guessed 
it—zero to five. On one axis is the known trustworthiness of the informant, 
from zero (known liar) to five (always accurate in the past). The opposite 
axis measures the amount of knowledge the informant might have about the 
information, from zero (not a clue) to five (expert in the field).
So, if you thought I was trustworthy and asked me about presenting, I might 
be a 5/5; if you asked me about Sumo wrestling, I’d be a 5/0; and if you asked a 
known burglar about housebreaking, he would be a 0/5.
The purpose of your introduction is to position yourself as a trustworthy 
expert in the field of your chosen “What do I want them to do?” action. Only 
one paragraph is needed, preferably three sentences. Because these are words 
for someone else to say it allows you to position yourself clearly with the 
added value that the words will come from a third party.
If you’ve ever been the chair of a meeting, you’ll know how relieved you’d be if 
the speaker simply passed you a card with the exact words nicely printed on 
it. Make it easy for them, and they’ll not only thank you because remarkably 
few speakers take this step, but they’ll also position you in the best way for 
your purpose.
So, you’ve been introduced, and you take the stage. The audience is ready to 
hear what you have to say because you have been introduced properly. And 
now you must begin.
We introverts don’t like to think about this too much because it’s the part that 
scares us the most. As a result, we put it out of our minds, and in the words of 
yet another bland business cliché, we prepare to fail by failing to prepare.

The first words you say have to be provocative.
The audience, even if you have prepared well, are sitting with their arms 
mentally folded—or actually folded—waiting for your pearls of wisdom and 
thinking “What’s in it for me?” At this point you have just one sentence in 
which to persuade them not to update their Facebook status. I have read 
an awful lot of presentation books, and the “What’s in it for me?” words 
appear in absolutely every one of them. So, among a wide variety of experts 
with a wide variety of attitudes and techniques, this is the common message. 
Therefore, your opening provocative statement needs to be personal to the 
audience and to hint at the final action you are going to ask.
For example, “I’d like to tell you how to be able to spend more time on your 
next vacation” and “All the information you have about your retirement is 
wrong, and I’m going to fix that” and “This new product is not just going to 
change your work, it’s going to change your life” are all opening statements 
that make your audience sit up and mentally say, “That’s interesting; tell me 
how,” which is exactly the reaction you are looking for.
Let’s review: you have an introduction, you have an opening provocative 
statement, and you have a concluding call to action. You’re all set for the next 
chapter. See you there.
MARY STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN AND STOPS: 
CONSTANT REVIEW
The next morning there was this e-mail:
Mare
Look at your closing lines. Are you happy with them?
M
M
After all this you want me to change them?
No, I’m very happy, thank you very much.
I’m not changing this ANYMORE. Meetings all morning….
Mary
Then that’s good. Now, look at your opening and make it as provocative as you can.
At the moment it’s a bit polite. Look at the close, and see if you can pose the question 
that answers. Call me. M

Mary was quite glad to avoid her presentation; she had a department meeting and a 
project meeting, and she was gulping coffee and downing painkillers. She felt dreadful. 
Where was the exhilaration of yesterday evening? When lunchtime came around, she 
“borrowed” one of the executive offices and turned the chair away from the door, put 
her feet up, and fell asleep. She was woken by her phone vibrating; it was Mike. She 
ignored the call.
She spent all day ignoring Mike’s calls.
Later that night, he texted her:
Did you find anything at home?
Yes, about that.
What?
I’m feeling a bit pursued.
Sorry?
Just back off! How did you get my home address?
It easy to find stuff online. What’s wrong?
I HATE CUT FLOWERS.
She turned her phone off. Five hours later she woke with mascara on the pillow. Dropping 
her clothes on the floor, she wiped her face quickly with makeup remover, crawled into 
bed, and turned the pillow over. Hugging herself under the covers she was asleep again 
in minutes.

Adding Support
Now we come to the slides. A lot of people are surprised that slides wait 
until this far into the process. There’s a reason for this. Among event industry 
professionals, slides are called speaker support, and although that usually means 
slides, it can mean props, sound effects, video clips, and anything else that isn’t 
a person at the podium talking.
The reason for the title is that slides support the presentation. They are not the 
presentation any more than the menu is the meal or the map is the territory.
I have a few things to say about slides.
A lot of people talk about “death by PowerPoint” as though it were an evil thing. 
It’s not. Of the many types of slide preparation software out there, PowerPoint 
is by far the most common. It’s a great program with lots of features and can 
produce slides of breathtaking creativity that make a great impact. However, 
most users only scratch the surface of what slide software can do. Slide  
software can execute only what you choose to put onscreen, and with that in 
mind, there are a few things to consider before you start making slides.
I heard Oscar-winning screenwriter William Goldman tell a group of 
scriptwriters how he works on a movie adapted from a book: he reads the 
book several times, each time using a different-colored pencil to underline 
key phrases. When he’s finished eight or nine reads, he has a color-coded 
synopsis. Those parts of the book with the most underlining get into the 
movie, reducing as indicated until the parts that have only one or two

marks might not make the final cut. Check out Goldman’s excellent books 
on a writer’s life in Hollywood, if that’s of interest.
Read your now immaculate script and use a highlighter to mark the key words. 
Do this several times—reading out loud if possible—until you have the key 
words; these are the ones that really encapsulate the main points of your 
presentations. These are the ones that cannot be reduced further and the 
ones that support the progression of ideas that lead inevitably to your final 
call to action.
A picture does indeed say a thousand words. Your slides should have as many 
pictures as possible and as few words as possible.
I’ll bet the room you will speak in will have lighting on the podium and little or 
no illumination on your audience. If you put up a slide that contains the words 
you are about to read, two things happen. First, your audience will read the 
words more quickly than you say them because we read about five times the 
speed at which we speak. So, your audience will have a lag between their hear-
ing and their reading, which creates confusion. Second, the last time someone 
turned out the lights and read to you was probably one of your parents trying 
to get you to go to sleep, so your audience will hardly find this energizing. It’s 
little wonder people fall asleep at conferences.
Your aim should be to produce the smallest possible number of slides with 
the fewest possible words on them, and those slides should only support your 
final call to action. Anything else just gets in the way. After Dinner Speaking 
supremo Graham Davies once told me he approaches large audiences as 
though they were both stupid and lazy. Individually they may be the brightest 
stars on the planet, but collectively they are stupid and lazy, and the greater in 
number, the more stupid and lazy they become. Your slides should pass the 
stupid and lazy test: will a stupid and lazy person get what you are going 
on about?
Finally, create the slides you have chosen. Your presentation will make 
complete sense without any of them. Your technology requirements will be 
simple and unlikely to go wrong, but if anything should happen to your slides, 
it will not matter.
There are loads of great freelance slide designers, and when your require-
ments are clear and simple, they will do a good job if you need them. If you are 
in the senior management of a company, it makes no sense to create the slides 
yourself when a professional will do a better job in much less time.
A few months ago I was asked to evaluate a startup company offering and 
most importantly why the company had failed to attract funding. My contact 
was the company chairman, who sent me the slides used in the presentation 
as background material. I’ve always believed that if you can get the full idea 
from just the slides, then there is no point in the speaker showing up at all.  

The Introverted Presenter

In this case, I could see that there were two problems: an ill-thought-out business 
plan coupled with a poorly structured presentation because the foundations 
we spoke about earlier had not been well constructed. The potential investors 
were far from lazy or stupid, but they could not tell from the presentation why 
they should part with their cash. Nor was this the end point of the speech. It 
took very little adjustment to make the business plan more rational and to 
make the presentation into something that engaged with a clear direction. 
That’s why I suggested that you avoid working on your slides until we got to 
this point.
Now you should have a well-constructed speech and a few well-positioned 
slides (if any), and you’ve been reading your script over and over until you are 
almost sick of it. You’re almost ready.
MARY IS RELUCTANTLY GOING FORWARD:  
TRUST THE PROCESS
“Good morning, Mary. How’s the presentation?”
“George! Um, I’m a bit busy this morning. How about we review it early next week?”
“I’m out next week, Mary. How about Friday morning? Say 10:30?”
“That would be, er, great!”
Mary returned to her office in a slight fog. Not only was she feeling poorly, she now had 
a deadline she could not miss. Three days. That meant two days to finish the slides. 
She took out her draft text, read it once, and headed for the coffee machine. She read 
it again while drinking coffee and started to scribble some slides. She looked at her 
schedule and realized she was already late for an internal meeting; she grabbed her 
coffee and her speech and rushed off.
Throughout the day Mary daydreamed through whatever she was doing, doodling on 
the speech as she did. By 6 p.m. she was sitting at her desk wondering what she’d 
done all day.
The phone rang. It was Mike.
“Mary, I’m really sorry if I upset you yesterday. I was calling to see how you’re doing.”
“Mary, are you still there?”
“I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling a lot of pressure right now.”
“Mary, I just wanted you to know I’m here if you want any help.”
“Actually, I’m just starting to think about slides.”
“This is the right time. What have you done so far?”

Chapter 8 | How to Love Technology

“Just doodles really. What do you do?”
“Think pictures; the slides are there to support what you’re saying, not to duplicate it. 
The best slides are pictures with no words.”
“Can I get someone else to do it for me?”
“Yes, you can, because now you are at a stage where you can brief the designer 
properly, but it’s easy to do yourself, or you can start yourself and get a designer to tart 
it up later.”
“I’ll try on my own, and then can I send it to you?”
“Of course, Mary. I’m here if you need me.”
“Thanks. I’ll try some now and finish it off in the morning. Thank you.”
Mary worked on for a couple of hours; once she started, things seemed to work OK. 
The slide software was a bit difficult, but she soon got the hang of it and liked putting in 
the pictures the company owned. By 8 p.m. she was exhausted but pleased. She went 
home and sent Mike a “thank you” text. He replied “sleep well”.

Primacy and 
Latency
What the Audience Remembers
I mentioned earlier how stressful standing and speaking can be. If you are 
inexperienced, this will be even more stressful. There’s a great temptation to 
sip a little of that free wine that’s being handed around beforehand. You know, 
just to relax a bit.
Don’t.
Your aim, remember, is to arrive at the podium calm and confident.
We’ve tried to make that happen by working toward the presentation by 
reading it out loud many times, so you know it. There’s no need to actually try 
to remember the whole thing word for word. Actors spend years learning how 
to do that, and you have two advantages over them; you wrote the words, and 
you can have notes. I recommend having the script and reading every word.
What I suggest is that you do commit to memory your provocative opening 
and the final call to action. You should be able to spout either of these at any 
time at a moment’s notice. What this means is that when you walk toward 
the podium, you will appear confident because you know without a moment’s 
thought the first words you will speak. From there on, you’ll find (trust me) 
the autopilot takes over. If you should get lost or confused at any point, you’ll 
also be able to recover easily because your final words are also branded across 
the inside of your forehead in a way that’s impossible to miss.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | Primacy and Latency
42
I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time on these first and final words because 
not only are they important for your own self-confidence and for the struc-
ture of your presentation, but they are also the parts of your talk that the 
audience is most likely to remember. If you think back to almost anything 
you’ve seen lately—TV show, movie, presentation, or stage play—if you can 
remember anything about them, you will recall the way they started and the 
way they ended. So it is with your presentation. Make sure those first and last 
statements really are as tight as they can possibly be.
From time to time I am asked to judge competitions or vote on awards entries 
for film or live events. This is interesting because it forces me to look at other 
people and their work. There is one glaring error of which almost all the 
failing entries are guilty.
When we go to see a stage play or a movie, there is a commitment; we’ve 
driven out, parked the car, arranged a babysitter, and possibly agreed to go for 
a meal afterward. In that situation your tolerance to a slow-starting story 
is very high—there’s a high cost to walking out. However, in a conference 
with multiple streams or a DVD you watch at home, there’s a much lower 
commitment cost.
In his excellent books on the craft of screenwriting, Jurgen Wolff gives this 
advice: always get into a scene at the last possible minute and get out as early 
as you can. The one glaring error that failing stories make is to spend too long 
at the start and end of each scene. We, the audience, want to get to the meat 
of the story as quickly as possible and then get to the conclusion of each point 
without great labor. This is a mistake made even by Oscar winners, so it’s not 
unlikely that you made it too. I do, all the time.
As a final review of your presentation, ask yourself this: if I deleted the first 
and last quarter (keeping the opening and closing statements), would anything 
be lost? If not, then well done, but I have used this technique in almost every 
presentation I’ve given and found something to remove.
If you have not done so before, it’s now time to give your presentation to a live 
person. Yep. You need to find a supportive spouse, co-worker, or friend. Stand 
up (this is important) and speak just as you would if you were on stage. Don’t 
allow comments until you have finished and then ask for their honest feedback. 
Don’t suggest things to them like “I’m unhappy with the third slide—what did 
you think?” Let them honestly tell you what they felt about your words.
Now, the closer your audience-of-one is to the eventual audience, the more 
effective they are likely to be, so if your presentation is to a bunch of 20-some-
things who work in the music business, your granny might not be the person 
to ask. Bear in mind how distant your audience will be from your guinea pig. 
And remember, this is just one opinion; use the 5/5 system to evaluate each 
part of the feedback and so avoid slavishly following every comment—it’s your 
presentation.

Repeat repeating the text, and subject as many people as possible to hearing 
it. You’re almost ready for the big day.
MARY’S NEXT DISASTER: KEEP THE FAITH
Friday morning at noon Mary called Mike from the bathroom at work; she wasn’t quite 
sobbing, but she was close. She explained how she had run through the presentation 
with her boss and how she felt it had gone terribly. “He just about criticized every slide,” 
she wailed.
Mike told her that this was the point. “You want him to make those comments in privacy, 
not in public on the bid day,” Mike reasoned. He asked her to go through all her notes 
and then pointed out that she had more than 2,000 words in her text. George had 
commented on just 12 things. She had 30 slides—Mike thought this was too many—and 
George had only 3 complaints. This is good news, Mike insisted.
“George just wants you to look good. And you have just faced your worst experience; 
this will only get better. What did he say at the end?”
“He asked me to e-mail him the revised presentation next week.”
“Mary, that’s great. If he’d been really critical, he would have wanted to see you perform 
for him again.”
“What do I do now?”
“Revise, reduce, and rehearse, but first…lunch?”
“Um….”

Prepare for 
Performance
Stage Presence
When I first ask speakers to start by writing a script, most of them do not 
believe this is a way to work, nor do they believe they will be able to remem-
ber the text. After all, they are not actors. However, I hope you’ve found that 
the frequent repetition you’ve done means you really do know your words 
pretty well. The good news, of course, is that you’ll have the script on the 
podium, so although you can remember the words, you don’t need to. 
It’s time to prepare for the big day. The first thing is to format your script  
so it’s easy to use and fits on the podium. I find printing in 18-point font, in 
landscape orientation, and on A5 paper works for me. Experiment to find 
what works for you. Do not bind the pages; keep them loose, which is why 
you must write the page numbers clearly on each sheet. I use a felt pen so the 
numbers look different from the text.
Send the slides and an electronic version of your script to the organizers. 
Take additional copies on a memory stick and a printout of the slides; I usually 
use the print option for “handouts,” which shows six per page.
Make two further copies of your script printed normally to take with you. 
Mark the slide cues on these.
Make a small (again, I prefer A5) sheet with your introduction in 18-point type.

Now you need to run through the presentation again, in front of a person or 
in front of the mirror. Keep in mind that you have completed the correction 
and improvement stage; you are now in “show mode,” so you are not going to 
change anything. It’s done. Resist any urge you have to tinker with the text or 
the slides. Practice, practice, practice. Then practice some more.
Once before bed on the night before your speech, read the text one last time. 
It will sink in further while you sleep.
MARY’S GROWING BOREDOM: REPETITION
Over the weekend Mary repeated her presentation to the bathroom mirror, to her cat, to 
her roommate, and on the phone to her Mom; she even did 30 seconds to her grocer. 
She scribbled on her script, which she had learned to call a script, so that when she 
arrived in the office on Monday, she spent half an hour reworking the text and adjusting 
the slides. Her slides were now down to 18. She really felt she had exhausted all the 
possibilities. She sent the text and slides to George and got a one-line e-mail back:
Much Better. Good luck. G.
Mike’s advice at this stage was simple: stop changing things. From now on, you  
continue rehearsing, but you’ve passed the revise, reduce, rehearse stage; there’s only 
rehearse left.
Feeling brave, Mary tried the presentation out on one of her colleagues at work. He 
made suggestions. Mike told her to listen only to the suggestions about the way she 
presented; leave the content alone. Over the next week she imposed on several people 
at work, including someone who would actually be at the event. She had surprisingly 
little to say: “That’ll be fine.” Mary had a sudden confidence failure. “Is that all she 
said?” asked Mike. Mary could not recall anything else in the way she had given the 
presentation, nor in the reaction of her guinea pig.
Mike’s advice was that some people talk only if they see something to complain about, 
so Mary should take the feedback as positive. Or investigate further. But he suggested 
that Mary didn’t need any more advice; she had now practiced enough. It was time to 
rest and relax.
“Fat chance,” Mary retorted.
As advised, Mary spent the weekend attempting to think of something else. Although she 
filled her time with distracting activities, her presentation was not far from her mind.
On Monday morning she was at the conference venue literally shaking with nerves, 
so she called Mike. He asked if she was sure the slides were correct and if she’d tried 
standing at the podium. He made her tell him the opening sentence and her closing 
line. He ended telling her that she’d done everything she could. “It’s quite normal to be 
nervous,” he reminded her. She hung up abruptly.

The Introverted Presenter
47
Standing at the podium after she was introduced, Mary felt her mouth go dry. She saw a 
glass of water but feared she would spill the water because her hands were shaking so 
much. With much trepidation, she pushed the button for her first slide and saw her name 
on the screen. She spoke the first sentence she had recently repeated to Mike.
And then it flowed.
The next sentence came automatically, and so did the next, and after a while she looked 
at her script. It was on the wrong page; she’d spoken without needing the text.
She had a moment of panic when she turned the pages to catch up. The dog-eared 
sheets were as familiar as anything she’d known. She turned to page 5 and lost her 
place. Flustered, she found it and resumed. She didn’t look down once more.
Before she knew it, she was at her last slide. Her final words were looming like the end 
of a rollercoaster. She took a big breath and delivered the final line and heard a strange 
noise. She hadn’t expected applause.
She rushed gratefully from the stage, sweaty, light-headed, and feeling drunk. Several 
people came up to speak to her, but she didn’t remember what they’d said. The rest of 
the day passed in a blur.

Time to Shine
Let It Flow
On the big day, your objective is to walk to the podium in a confident manner. 
You will be nervous, but that’s how it is.
Most professional actors still get nervous before every performance. Early in 
my theater career I was working backstage and saw that a very famous actor 
owned two very old enamel bowls that he placed in the wings of every theater 
in which he appeared. By mistake I “tided” them away; a kindly older stage 
manager took me to one side and explained. The bowls were there because 
he regularly vomited from stage fright. I heard a radio interview with the great 
man several years later saying that he embraced the stage fright as an impor-
tant part of his performance; he said that the day he did not feel it was the day 
he would retire. He didn’t retire.
Your objective is not to avoid feeling nervous; it is to manage it. Plan every-
thing you can to make the experience as enjoyable as you can. When you 
are—naturally—nervous, you will at least know that you are well prepared, 
you know your speech, you are familiar with your surroundings, your message 
is as well prepared as it can be, and all you have to do is to say the words in 
the best way you can. Here’s how you do that.
Arrive at the venue ridiculously early. Some try to leave as late as possible, 
but they miss out on a number of things. It’s better to be bored than rushed. 
If you can possibly do so, stand at the podium and deliver some—or all—of 
your speech. The sound engineer will thank you, and the experience will make 
a big difference to your speech. If there is a slide technician, then hand over 
the copy of your script with the slide cues marked on it. Drink lots of water, 
be sure you go to the bathroom, and avoid all coffee, tea, and alcohol until 
afterward. You are in a delicate state—take care of yourself.

Many speakers do not like giving control of their slides to a technician, but it’s 
really a good idea. At the least, it’s one less thing to worry about, and these 
technicians are much better than you will be because that’s all they do. When 
I’ve asked why speakers are reluctant to relinquish control of the slides, the 
answers I get all center on some aspect of worry about what happens if it 
goes wrong in the middle of the presentation. The answer to those worries is 
that if something does go wrong, the technician backstage is in a much better 
position to fix it than the sweaty nervous speaker at the podium who must 
keep talking at all times.
Another way of “going wrong” is that the slide might not change when you 
want it to, or you might go off script for some reason, and that might throw 
off the technician. In my experience, slide technicians are remarkably intuitive 
and, if you do go off script, will invariably get it right. My final thought on this is 
that there is absolutely nothing wrong with standing at the podium and saying 
“Can I have the next slide, please?” I know. Revolutionary.
While you are in the venue before the event starts, make sure your introducer 
has your introduction and a copy of your text if they want one; many meeting 
chairpeople like to know when you are likely to finish so they can prepare 
whatever comments they are likely to make after you have finished. Know 
where you will sit while waiting your turn. Actually walk the few steps from 
your chair to the podium. Do it several times. Make sure there is a glass of 
water nearby, and don’t be scared to stop and drink during the presentation.
Now it’s time. You are sitting comfortably, you know your material and have 
a numbered script ready to use as a prompt, you know the way to walk up 
to the podium, and your introducer has the exact words you want said. The 
slides are all ready, and they simply support the main points leading to your 
final statement. You know the first few words you will say, and you are mostly 
confident that once you are started, you’ll be able to keep going until the end. 
Now you just need to say the words.
As you sit there, trying not to feel nervous but knowing it’s OK that you do, 
I’d like to put one final thought into your head.
Think about the times you’ve sat in the audience and listened to a speech. 
What was going through your head? I’ll bet you didn’t have any feelings of 
animosity. Most audiences are actively supporting the presenter; they want 
to hear what you have to say or they would be in another room. They want 
to understand what you have to say. They want you to do well. You are not 
going to face the lions in the Coliseum; you are chatting to a bunch of friends. 
Now go and tell them the words that make you an expert.

THE END OR THE BEGINNING? POWER UNLEASHED
The next morning Mary was back in the office. It all looked the same, and no one treated 
her differently, but somehow it was all different. There were 15 e-mails congratulating 
her on the presentation she’d given the day before, and she was relieved it was over. 
Somehow it all felt a bit, well, flat. She looked at the detritus in her inbox; it all seemed so 
trivial. She hadn’t expected a fanfare as she walked in, but this felt so anticlimactic.
She’d arrived home the previous evening at 7 p.m., watched TV, fell asleep on the sofa, 
roused herself at 9, and moved to bed; she woke ravenous at 6 a.m., ate the biggest 
breakfast her depleted kitchen could offer, and arrived at work good and early full of 
good intentions, but now she had no energy for anything.
Mike had sent a text asking how it had gone the previous afternoon, and she’d replied 
that she was glad it was over. That was it.
After pretending to shuffle papers around her desk and drinking too much coffee, she 
was woken from her fog by an e-mail from George saying that his boss had seen her 
presentation and congratulated George on the performance by one of the stars in his 
department. From the content of the e-mail Mary suspected he’d mixed her up with 
someone from another department.
Then Mike called to suggest a “celebratory lunch,” and although she didn’t feel much 
like celebrating, it was something to put on her empty calendar. Changing his name to 
suggest he might be a client, she renewed her makeup and left the office, still feeling as 
though she was in rehab.
He greeted her in the restaurant with a restrained peck on the cheek.
“How does it feel to have a new career?” Mike asked.
“What do you mean?”
“Things will never be the same again.”
He smiled, and she broke her rule of never drinking at lunchtime.

The Aftermath
No One Asked for This
It’s all over, it went better than you hoped, and there’s a list of 20 things you’d 
do better next time. You are offered a drink and accept gratefully; several 
people want to talk to you. You need a strategy for handling all this.
First, about those things that didn’t go the way you wanted: file them away and 
shut up about them. No one wants to know about that, and most of them are 
only in your head.
Second, you need to deal quickly with all those clamoring for your attention. 
This is the bit the extroverts love, but we introverts find it a bit of a challenge. 
My personal strategy is to have a pile of business cards for a quick swap and 
then to announce which part of the venue I will be in after the event. This 
means I’m not in a post-speech fluster and can form genuine contact with 
potential business partners. Channel your inner politician and glad hand as 
many as you can while trying to form short but meaningful contact.
Third, get out. Go to the bathroom, walk around the block, or do something 
that removes you from the throng. You will be so relieved the speech is over 
that you need some quiet time.
Fourth, reengage. Reenter the fray and see who wants some of your time.
If your presentation was captured on video, take a look at it a few days later. 
File away any notes for next time because there will be a next time. You have 
proven you can do it now. You will be asked again.
If you have slavishly followed the process I’ve laid out in this book, you will be 
a competent presenter with clarity and purpose. If this took you two weeks, 
then the next time it will take you three days, and the next time even less.  
But never lose sight of the process; however quick you get at it, always do it 
in the right sequence.

Most events have some form of feedback mechanism used, and this can be 
informative, but it’s also dangerous stuff. You’ll want to evaluate it differently 
in different situations. For example, you can use the feedback very specifically if 
you are likely to give the same presentation again at a different time, and you’ll 
also want to see where you can improve overall in the way you construct 
your appearances. Generally, I find that the feedback you have yourself—the 
feeling you have as you leave the stage—is a much harsher critic than anyone 
in the audience. There is also the issue of what questions were asked in the 
feedback. Look at this very critically.
Management consultants are fond of two-by-two grids, so here is one:
This is a bit confusing until it’s explained. The grid is comparing whether 
something is done badly or well. Doing Things Right appears along the  
bottom axis, so on the left are things done well (Done Right), and on the right  
they are things done badly (Done Wrong). On the vertical axis, we are  
comparing whether we are doing the correct thing (Doing the Right Thing) 
or the wrong thing.
Some examples might be that if you were hosting a dinner party, you might be 
a good cook and therefore able to Do Things Well, but if I was a vegetarian 
and you cooked meat, it does not matter how well you cooked it; it would not 
be a meal I would like to eat. So, you’d be doing the wrong thing and doing it 
very well.
You may think this is a bit pedantic and deliberately using confusing words. 
However, it’s making what is in my mind an important point, and it’s one that 
produces some very muddled thinking particularly in the interpretation of 
event feedback.
Event organizers are often guilty of focusing on the wrong thing and of taking 
great care to get the wrong thing very right indeed. From the dinner party 
example, I hope you can see that it better to do the right thing badly than it is 
to do the wrong thing very well. If I were vegetarian, I would be happier with 
poorly cooked food I can eat than with excellently prepared stuff that I can 
only look at.

Feedback is also an excellent way of improving on the wrong thing and doing 
it better and better over the years. Meaning, the vegetarian is delivered ever 
better steak.
It’s important this distinction is not lost, not misinterpreted, and not used to 
make your presentation less than the fantastic speaking opportunity you made 
into the best piece of communication it could possibly be.
Now that you are an experienced presenter, you can use the skills you have 
learned here in many aspects of your working and personal life. We introverts 
will never be entirely comfortable in the spotlight, but with planning and care 
we can learn to enjoy it and become very good at it, while managing the pro-
cess and continuously improving.

The Last-Minute 
Panic
Emergency Preparation
It’s 9 p.m., and you’ve arrived at the hotel. The conference starts tomorrow 
at 8:30 in the morning. You have a note from the event producer asking you 
to visit the conference room at 7 a.m. Up to now you’ve been too busy to 
give your presentation a moment’s thought. Now there’s a sick feeling in your 
stomach, and the mini bar looks inviting.
I was once called to a client conference on rehearsal day and asked to offer 
tips to the speakers. There was one woman I could not help much. She was 
very elegant, she had a great speaking manner, and her assistant had briefed 
a great designer to produce about 30 slides covering every aspect of her 
department. She ended her rehearsal slot by flicking through the remaining 
ten slides and muttering, “I’ll think of something to say at the end.” Up to that 
point I’d been impressed at her ability to make a decent effort with material 
she had clearly only just seen.
I took her to one side and offered my assistance. Her reply: “I have only  
20 minutes to get ready for the welcome dinner. There’s no more that can 
be done.” With that she swept out of the room, four assistants following 
with notepads. The following day she was better than rehearsal but still not  
prepared. She lasted five more months with the company.
I’m not saying this to frighten you. You’re scared enough already. I am saying it 
to make you focus on those things you can do—right now—to improve your 
chances on stage tomorrow. Follow me and you will be OK.

Chapter 13 | The Last-Minute Panic

Yes, you should have done it earlier. Yes, it won’t be perfect. Yes, you can  
beat yourself up…but we can do all we can. This involves not putting it off 
anymore, and you have no time to waste, so let’s get on with it.
First, call room service. No one does well in a stressful situation on an empty 
stomach.
Now, while the food is on its way, it’s time to really, really focus. So, get a sheet 
of paper and write down the one thing you want your audience to know when 
you have finished speaking.
There was—allegedly—a poster on the wall in Bill Clinton’s campaign office 
that said this: “If you say more than one thing, you have not said anything at 
all.” In today’s crowded environment an audience wants a compelling message 
it can understand and act on. Get really clear about the one thing you want 
to say.
Another way to look at it is to think “If I could say only one thing, what would 
it be?”
You need to achieve a Zen-like calm about this important message; let the  
million thoughts flooding your head clear away and decide on this one message. 
Your success on stage tomorrow depends on this one thought. It’s tempting 
to allow all the many things you could say cloud your judgment, but if you can 
achieve this clarity, it will do wonders for the success of your presentation.
Still with me? OK, you have one thing written down. Pin it up somewhere you 
can see it; the room is going to get messy.
Now you can have supporting facts. And these will get confused in your mind 
because your mind will now try to shoehorn in all the facts you have and  
confuse the issue. So, write down all the things you can think of, each one on 
a separate piece of paper. Sticky notes work well if you have some. I find those 
little pads of hotel notepaper useful too.
The more expert you are, the more of these you will have, and I know you’re 
an expert. How do I know that? You’ve been invited to speak, of course, and 
you know so much about your topic you have not bothered to prepare.
Using your great expertise, generate loads of facts that support your main 
message. Go on. You’ve been told since the age of five not to make a mess, 
and here I am positively encouraging you. Anyway, no one can see. Except me. 
I am everywhere.
Do that and join me back here when you’re done.
Now the tricky bit. Actually, the only tricky bit.

The Introverted Presenter
59
You have to choose just three of those facts to support your main message. 
This is where Darwinism comes in. It’s survival of the fittest. Allow your facts 
to engage in gladiatorial combat until only the strongest survive. It will be a 
bloody fight, but you will have those three that emerge victorious.
Now, it’s time to tidy up. Write your main message and your three supporting 
facts here.
Main Message
Supporting Fact 1
Supporting Fact 2
Supporting Fact 3

Chapter 13 | The Last-Minute Panic
60
You now have your content. No more is required. The tricky stuff is over; it’s 
all process from here on out.
Next, make a story. How do these three facts tell the main message you have? 
This is the bit we all know how to do, although sometimes we pretend we 
don’t. To engage the most useful part of your brain, imagine that you meet an 
old friend for a drink. This friend knows nothing about your chosen career, 
and casually he asks: “What do you mean by that?”
Pay close attention to your answer.
One mistake often made in presentations is that we forget how to speak, 
reverting to industry jargon and trying to speak like a lawyer or like a piece 
of written prose. This is a speech. Speak like a human, and your audience will 
understand you.
Now it’s time to write your actual words.
Twenty minutes is 1,200 seconds. Humans speak about three words for every 
two seconds. So, a 20-minute talk needs about 800 words. It’s about the  
number of words in this chapter up to here.
If you are speaking for more than 20 minutes, then don’t use all the time.  
No one wants to hear more. No audience member will complain if the  
coffee break comes early; no conference organizer will complain if you are 
the one to get things back on track after earlier speakers ran long. The worst 
thing that will happen is that you get time to take questions.
At this point, if you have time, I highly recommend writing out your speech in 
full, but I know you are keen to put this behind you, so you might be tempted 
to just list topic headings on some 3x5 cards or scamp out the presentation 
as a mind map. Frankly, it’s whatever floats your boat. Get the thing in a format 
that is as clear for you as it can be.
Read it through out loud a couple of times and see how long it takes.
Adjust accordingly.
Now it’s time to look at slides. At a minimum, you may use five slides.
Your name and the title of your talk
• 
Point 1
• 
Point 2
• 
Point 3
• 
Your key message
• 
Anything more is just showing off.

The Introverted Presenter
61
Author and Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has a rule for presentations that 
he calls 10/20/30:
No more than ten slides
• 
Speak for no more than 20 minutes
• 
Use 30-point type or larger
• 
Whenever you can use a picture instead of words, your slides will have more 
impact. We remember pictures; we do not remember text. Remember, use as 
few slides as possible and as many pictures as possible. Show, don’t tell.
If you already have a prepared slide deck, you may like to use a little-known 
function of your slide program: the Delete button. Ruthlessly cut out any 
slides that do not help your story.
Now you have a story to tell, and you have a nice, memorable terse set of 
slides to help you tell that story.
It’s time to rehearse again, with slides this time, and then go to bed. You 
need your sleep, and the presentation will—magically—embed itself while you 
sleep. Plus, tomorrow is your big day.
Nerves will affect you; nerves are just excitement with bad PR. By keeping 
your message simple, keeping your objective clear, and removing distract-
ing slides, you have minimized this. By keeping the presentation concise and 
focused, there is less time to worry.
There are a few additional things that will help you get through the day.
Have a good breakfast.
• 
Don’t drink coffee.
• 
Keep a bottle (not a glass) of water with you at the 
• 
podium.
Remember those in the audience want you to succeed.
• 
Get to the room early and rehearse on stage as much as 
• 
possible.
Above all, remember where you are going.
• 
While I have you, you might think “that went OK,” and it will go OK. But if 
you want to really wow your audience, this is simply not good enough. The 
great orators are great because they spend time getting the presentation just 
perfect. Winston Churchill estimated that each minute of a speech takes one 
hour of preparation, which means three working days of preparation for one 
twenty-minute speech.
Using the steps I’ve described here, you’ll be fine. You could be exceptional.

Step 1: Preparation
I waited in the boardroom for Barry. I was given the nice cups and posh 
snacks, which were all indications of status, as was his keeping me waiting 
for 15 minutes. He walked in talking on his phone and waved to me, pouring 
himself coffee while carrying on the conversation.
“Did you get my presentation?”
I replied that I had received his slides: all 35 of them for a 20-minute 
presentation.
Barry pulled out his laptop. I put my hand on it to stop him and told him I’d 
like to talk about the context first.
If I’d grabbed his crotch, the body language could not have been more dramatic. 
He put the laptop down but not away. As he spoke, he absentmindedly wiped 
the place I’d touched the laptop with his sleeve.

“My assistant has been working on those slides for over a week,” he said while 
taking out a printed version of the same thing. He clutched it to his chest like 
some kind of security blanket.
In my coaching work I’m a bit of a development magpie, picking up bits and 
pieces from any number of techniques, philosophies, psychological models, and 
influencing skills.
The thing I use most of all is simple: observing body language and then seeing 
how it changes with each piece of added input from me. With practice, it gets 
to be easy to identify the anxieties that need to be overcome.
Barry was scared. Barry was also unable to tell me what he was scared about. 
The reliance on slides is a frequent symptom; my first job was to get him to 
talk about something else.
Barry’s boss had suggested he work with me. Recently promoted to manage-
ment, Barry knew the technical side of his business well. His business was 
software security. The promotion meant Barry was now required to give 
presentations regularly; this opportunity was his baptism by fire. I also suspect 
Barry’s boss was afraid his new recruit might prove an embarrassment.
I told Barry I had seen the slides and had looked over them the night before. 
I also took out a notepad and began to write.

The Introverted Presenter
65
I rarely need to refer to any notes I take in a coaching session, but some 
people—and I guessed Barry was one of them—take comfort from the  
knowledge that facts are being recorded. In fact, at the end of my process, it 
matters not a bit whether I remember the facts of the presentation; it only  
matters whether Barry remembers. No one I have coached has ever taken notes.
Small steps were needed with Barry. I started by asking questions I could not 
know from looking at the slides; I asked about the audience, the time of day, 
the venue, and the other speakers. It was all interesting stuff for me, but the 
real purpose was to get Barry thinking about the context in which his presen-
tation would be received.
As any event producer will tell you, context is everything. I remember as a 
child watching Monty Python on the BBC. The program was scheduled just 
before the evening news, which then on at 9 p.m. I recall laughing through the 
first few items of the news; that’s how powerful the Monty Python sense of the 
absurd was. It took a really shocking opening news story to break the spell.
Barry told me that his company mostly sold to other IT companies, and the 
event at which he was speaking was the annual gathering for people in the 
Internet security business. So, the audience would be a gathering of his peers, 
competitors, and potential customers.
Although I had looked at the slides, they had been so dense with jargon 
and mysterious diagrams that I had not really understood them. That’s quite 
common; I am not in the Venn diagram of his audience.
A little more probing established that Barry’s main concerns were to get 
across the details of his company’s new product, impress his peers, and begin 
the sales process with those people in the audience who might be prospects.

Appendix A | Case Study
66
It’s common that a presentation is actually aimed at a small percentage of the 
audience. I have known presentations made in an auditorium seating more 
than 1,000 where the actual message was for just one person. It’s not as mad 
as it sounds. Sometimes that’s the only way to get that one person to listen 
to you. Sometimes you need the peer pressure of an ovation to convince. 
Sometimes there’s one decision maker and a whole load of other people who 
could say “no,” and then there’s the prestige of being a speaker that adds to 
the credibility of the message.
I suggested to Barry that we focus on his prospects and then address any 
potential fallout, if there was any, in the other groups later. This was a mis-
take on my part because it allowed him to pick up his precious slides again. 
I learned just how desperately he was clinging to the life raft of the slides 
his assistant has created.
“I don’t have time to rework any of these,” he claimed.
Of course, the words “I don’t have time” are always a front for something else; 
sometimes it means “other things are more important” or “I’m not prepared 
to give my attention to this,” but my feeling was that Barry was still in what 
I call procrastination mode. He was putting off his preparation until it was 
simply too late. It was time for me to change tack.
I asked him what he wanted from our time together. The truth that I knew, 
but he did not know that I knew, was that his boss had been coached by me 
a few months before and had decided that this presentation was simply too 
important to be left to chance. Barry had been told to use me. This is never 
a good way to start a coaching session. The coachee often responds like a 
truculent teenager, and it’s difficult to make progress without adopting a poor 
impression of a remedial teacher.
All things considered, Barry was being more adult in his attitude than he might 
have been, but the anxiety needed to be removed. So, I tried changing the 
subject; I told him we needed to discuss the exact message he was using with 
his slides (suggesting that he didn’t need to change them although that was 
my aim), but first I’d like to take a look at his personal style. I asked him about 
presentations he admired and then on to films he liked, TV shows he enjoyed, 
and books he read.
It’s surprisingly easy to get the people I coach off the topic of their presenta-
tion, particularly if they are procrastinators. As you’ll see, this is not just my 
wasting time with a nice chat; I was also trying to get Barry away from the 
blind panic of clutching to his slides as though they were his presentation. 
The scariest thing I could have said to Barry was that the audience is not 
coming to see his slides; they are coming to see him.

The Introverted Presenter
67
The background also gives me insight into the kind of story Barry was best at 
telling. It’s all a bit of neurolinguistic programming (NLP), but I watch him like 
a hawk as he tells me things with his words and mostly with his body.
Having dragged his attention away from the slides, I told Barry I didn’t fully 
understand his business or its products, so I asked him to explain in layperson’s 
terms what the point was of the new product.
It’s true that I didn’t really understand any of the intricacies of cloud-based IT 
security in the finance sector, but my ignorance was not the reason for the 
question. I wanted to see whether Barry could speak like a human and not use 
the language on his slides that were clearly written by Spock.
I’d already persuaded him to talk about something other than his presentation, 
and he seemed to be an intelligent human being. Now I was bringing him back 
to the topic but from another angle. It worked for a while, and he explained 
the new product in ways that made sense to me as someone who wanted 
to be able to do my banking and shopping online. Then he reached for his 
slide printout, and the techspeak came back. There was one big difference, 
however; this time he didn’t clutch his slides like a security blanket but spread 
them messily across the table and was pointing to the relevant images and 
underlining them with a pencil.
Progress. Now I knew he would be able to change his slides; all I needed was 
for him to know that too.
Barry then bought up the often-asked question of where to stand. He started 
with the assumption that his laptop would be on the podium, and he would 
stand behind it. But he’d seen a TED Talk, and that speaker didn’t have anything 
on stage; she just walked around. Barry liked this look and wanted to emulate 
it. He was worried about how he could operate his slides and whether he 
could pull it off.
We talked a little about Barry’s anxieties before I was able to tell him a few 
things about staging.
If everyone else is using the podium, then it’s a way to 
• 
stand out.
There are lots of ways to cue slides without being near 
• 
your laptop.
If the podium is there, you can always retreat behind it.
• 
Once you’ve moved away from the podium, you are 
• 
unlikely to return.
I wanted Barry to feel able to experiment, so we planned to try a few different  
options during rehearsal. That seemed to calm him, and we moved on to 
other things.

Appendix A | Case Study
68
Step 2: Objective
The next move was to make my “magic question.” This is a technique I have 
stolen from the work of Mark McKergow and Solutions Focus. I said I was a 
magpie.
I asked Barry what would happen if everything went wrong on the day and he 
could show just one slide.
The sequence I use in coaching differs depending on the person I’m work-
ing with. I sensed Barry was ready to consider the possibility that the order 
of the slides might alter, but as I was still asking him to help me understand 
his message, I wasn’t actually saying this out loud. I was also using this as a 
roundabout way to get to his ultimate objective.
The magic question often produces lengthy agonizing, but in Barry’s case he 
was surprisingly decisive, selecting a slide that was number 23 out of 35.
I then asked him why that was the pivotal slide.
“It shows our changes to the architecture that improve usability for the user 
while increasing security for the finance house and the merchant. It’s really the 
only thing we’ve done that is truly revolutionary.”
Quite often I can tell when I’m coaching experts in their field. They have too 
many slides because they know too much. The problem isn’t understanding; 
it’s understanding what matters.
If I were being cruel at this point, I’d ask Barry why he needed the other 
34 slides, but I thought he was still a little fragile for that kind of challenge.
I tried to understand the implications of the new product by Socratic inquiry. 
Basically this means acting like my daughter when she was three and just 
asking “Why?” after every answer until the plain truth becomes obvious. 
Even to me.
I then asked Barry to find three slides that contained hard facts—facts that 
supported the message given on slide 23. This proved more difficult, and he 
initially circled eight slides on his printout.
I eliminated those that were not hard facts—facts that could not be disputed 
by anyone in the room. Now we were down to four. I asked him to rank them 
in terms of importance to the key slide and simply suggested he take the top 
three. This produced the most agony to date.
It was time for a refill of coffee to break the tension. I even managed one of 
the nice snacks.
Having established the three supporting slides, I told Barry it didn’t matter if 
it was three, two, or four, but there needed to be a small number of facts that 
the audience could take away.

The Introverted Presenter
69
I don’t think he noticed the switch from talking about my understanding to 
talking about the audience. That subtle shift allows me to overtly suggest 
that his slide deck might be reordered. One of the three supporting slides 
appeared after slide 23.
Time for magic question 2.
I asked Barry to focus on the prospects in the audience. What would be the 
best outcome after his presentation?
“I want them to place an order and credit me with the sale.”
We talked about that for a while. It wasn’t likely that anyone in the audience 
would actually have an order pad with them nor the authority to place an 
order immediately. So, I pushed for a more realistic outcome.
“I want 50 percent of my target prospects to contact me, either on the day 
or soon after.”
That was SMART in every sense.
Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Realistic
Timely
I then suggested that in order to make that happen, we might reorder his 
slides a little. Barry took it very well and reached for his laptop again. I stopped 
him once more.
I told him we had a clear objective and that we had agreed to alter the order 
of the slides, but I wanted to take one more step before we did that.
Step 3: Outline
In presentation coaching work, I find I spend very little time actually coach-
ing. This next part of our session was almost all directive. Coaches move on 
a line between coaching (helping you find the answer you already know) to 
mentoring (telling you facts that allow you to make decisions on your own) 
to instructional (teaching you things) and finally directives (telling you what 
to do). The skill—it seems to me—lies in knowing where you are and where 
you should be at all times.

Appendix A | Case Study
70
There was a flip chart in the room; I asked Barry to write his desired outcome 
at the bottom of the sheet.
Above that I told him to leave a space.
Above that he summarized his key slide.
Above that he wrote the three supporting facts; then I allowed him one more.
Opener
Supporting Fact 1
Supporting Fact 2
Supporting Fact 3
Outcome
Above that I told him to write “Opener.”
There’s no “right” way to do it, but this seemed the best way given Barry’s 
state of nervousness and the way he’d prepared for our meeting.
What I was hoping was to find the story Barry could tell. I was then hoping 
he would either completely rewrite his slides or radically edit them. But first 
things first: we needed a structure.
What Barry had written on the flip chart was the basics of a structure lacking 
two key elements. First I wanted to address his closing sentence.
He had the objective clear; he wanted 50 percent of the prospects in the audi-
ence to contact him after he’d spoken. I asked Barry to come up with a call to 
action that might achieve that.
“What about an incentive?” he asked. “I could offer them something to get in 
touch for.”
We talked about a qualifier. It’s easy to get a response for a freebie, but that would 
appeal to everyone in the room; we wanted just the prospects to respond.  
So, we needed to find an incentive that would appeal only to those in the market 
for his company’s product and with the budget and authority to act.
Barry suggested he would talk to his boss about this, which relieved me.
In coaching we often get hung up on one particular detail while losing sight of 
the bigger picture. I was keen that Barry found what he was looking for, but 
in this instance I didn’t mind what that was. I really wanted to get back to his 
presentation.
I then asked Barry to think about his opening.

The Introverted Presenter
71
“Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s an honor and a pleasure to be asked to speak here 
today” was his suggestion.
I almost fell asleep.
I asked if there was something provocative he could say—something that 
would wake up his audience and really make them pay attention.
Barry felt he had to be polite, so I asked what he would say if he didn’t need 
to be polite.
“We are going to take over the world, and you’ll all be out of a job in three years.”
Well, that would certainly get attention. Could he actually follow through and 
prove that? Barry told me he could, but he didn’t want to be so aggressive.
Sometimes we need to be in touch with a deeper feeling in order to then pull 
back to the more polite version.
For now, I asked Barry to write “All out of a job” in the “Opener” space.
I asked him to step back and take a look at his outline.
We were nearing the end of our first session and were due to meet again in 
four days. I gave him homework to do. He was to write his own script. Word 
for word—write 1,800 words because that’s all you’ll have time for.
“I can’t remember a script; that’s not how I work,” he protested.
I told him not to worry about that. He might remember the words; he might 
not. This exercise was about formulating the ideas and getting the outline 
fleshed out into something solid.
“But what about my slides?” Barry really was clutching at straws.
I told him not to worry about the slides either; his slides were lovely (they 
weren’t, but that message was for another day). I told him just to focus on the 
text for now, and we’d work on the rest of his presentation the next time.
Barry wasn’t sure, but he left promising to write something anyway.
Step 4: First Draft
Four hours before we were next due to meet, Barry’s assistant sent me an 
e-mail saying he was too busy to see me. I replied, telling her I would still be 
charging for the cancellation.
If someone were to try to write the algorithm that dictates my charging policy, 
it would be very complicated, and I’m not sure I understand it myself.

Appendix A | Case Study
72
By canceling/postponing on the day by e-mail and getting his assistant to do it, 
Barry had three strikes against him, so I showed no mercy. I also suspected this 
was another power play that I find repulsive, so make that four strikes.
Strangely, clients often cancel the second meeting. It’s probably because they 
have not done their homework, but also it’s because the reason they need me 
in the first place is because procrastination is taking hold of any preparation 
they should be doing. Postponing me when they are not personally paying the 
bill is just another form of procrastination.
We finally met three days later. I am always early for meetings, but Barry was 
ahead of me sitting in the boardroom with his typed text in his hand and 
another copy for me. Good boy.
Step 5: Refinement
“Would you like time to read it?” asked Barry, eager as a puppy.
I told him I didn’t want to read it; I wanted him to read it to me, standing at 
the other end of the room.
That knocked him back, but for a good reason.
As Barry read his text, I deliberately did not look at my copy. I looked at him 
as he read. I was gauging a number of things as he read: the text, his speaking 
style, how familiar he was with the words, whether it made sense to the virgin 
ear, and how he was standing.
It seemed to me he had actually written the words himself; he had also never 
read the words out loud before. His presentation style was fine.
There was lots of work to do, but the basis was solid.
As soon as he finished, he scuttled back to his seat. I immediately made him 
get up and do it again. This time I did follow the text with my copy, marking 
those points where Barry diverted from the script and those passages he 
found difficult.
If something is not working in the message and the concept, then this is the 
last chance to fix that. If there are minor technicalities to get over, then 
I become a technician suggesting things that Barry might find easier.
We worked through the text three times before I decided enough was enough. 
I suggested Barry type up the reworked script and that our session was at an 
end. He looked worried.
“How will I remember all that?” he asked. “And when can I mark the slide cues?”

The Introverted Presenter

I explained that while he might or might not remember the whole thing, this 
was part of the process that we would look at the next time and that the 
slides would also be put in at the next session.
Sometimes I get to the slides during session 2, but in this case I felt Barry’s 
attention should be on the words he was going to say.
Step 6: Final Draft
My third, and final, session with Barry arrived, and I managed to persuade him 
that this session should be offsite. I knew the conference center where he was 
due to speak and had managed to book a small room there. But that wasn’t 
my intended venue.
As soon as Barry arrived, I asked him to walk with me, and we took a tour 
of the building, including the main hall where some technicians were moving 
staging around. Checking with them, we trespassed on the stage for a while.
I asked Barry to try speaking in the room, with no microphones, no script, no  
witnesses (except the technicians who could not have cared less), and no pressure.
Of course, Barry did most of his speech from memory; he mucked up a bit of 
it, and he missed out about half a page.
We returned to our little room with Barry’s head held high.
We talked—a lot—about how Barry felt standing on the stage, including how 
he would feel when he was in the same place in one week’s time, how the 
technicians were completely indifferent, and how surprised he was at how 
much of the script he’d remembered.
Of course, the slight mistakes he’d made passed without causing him any panic 
attack because it was just an empty room and did not matter. When his peers 
and prospects were watching him, everything would matter massively.
Step 7: Visual Support
It was time to talk slides.
Having persuaded Barry to ignore the slides, I watched his face fall when 
I brought it up.
I often think of my job as guiding clients on the roller coaster that is pre-
sentation preparation. Like them, I hate presenting. Like them, I am prone to 
procrastination. Like them, I need a kick on the backside occasionally. Unlike 
them, I have a robust process that I know works, and clients seem to enjoy 
leaving the process to me.

Slides. Barry was now worried that his newly scripted presentation did not 
match his slides. I told him how we would now edit the slides to match the 
script.
I’ve been accused of being a bit down on slides. I constantly tell my coaching 
clients not to focus on the slides.
That’s not because they are not important; they are very important. Slides are 
just not where you start from in preparing a presentation; they are where you 
end up.
Earlier I referred to Guy Kawasaki’s formula 10/20/30:
No more than ten slides.
• 
Speak for no longer than 20 minutes.
• 
Use no smaller than 30-point type.
• 
With all things presentation, there are no “rules.” There are only guidelines. 
Apply the previous formula unless there is a good reason not to.

Point Type
Now that Barry had a compelling story to tell, slides are great for amplifying 
that message into a truly memorable piece of communication.
There is an oft-quoted piece of research that shows that if we hear informa-
tion, we recall about 12 percent. If we see information, we recall slightly more, 
about 19 percent. But if we have congruence between what we hear and what 
we see, the figure goes up to more than 60 percent.
Like most oft-quoted research, this is utter rubbish that gets repeated often 
enough because the underlying principle is sort of right.
In fact, recall is incredibly variable. The defining factors are the type of infor-
mation, the audience’s engagement with the message, the learning styles of the 
audience, and the skill of both the words and the visuals used.
Another way of looking at it is that your audience will have a number of differ-
ent learning styles; you need to hit all of them. For more information on this 
topic, take a look at any of the Accelerated Learning books available. There 
are links to some of them on The Introverted Presenter web site.
Slides are great for supporting what you are saying. They are rubbish at replac-
ing your talk, and they are positively damaging if the messages on the slide 
conflict with your words. This happens surprisingly often.

The Introverted Presenter
75
Once you have a clear objective and text, it’s time to create slides that help 
that message along.
Among event professionals, slides are often called speaker support, which is 
strange in that—as far as I know—it’s the only professional expression that is 
longer than the layperson’s term. Professional terms are usually ways for those 
in the profession to save time.
The reason is that slides are (once again) there to support your message.
That’s what they are good for.
Creating slides is easy; Barry was going about it the hard way. He only really 
needed five slides.

Supporting Fact 3
Final conclusion or call to action
Anything else is just decoration.
Barry had his assistant design the slides. He seemed like an intelligent guy, but 
he was certainly no designer. There are many designers out there who spend 
all day every day just making slides. I know many executives who spend their 
night hours producing slides when someone costing one-third of their hourly 
rate could do a much better job. Why is this? They don’t know what to say 
to a designer. Well, Barry could (if he were starting from scratch) now be in a 
position to brief a designer very concisely.
From the five slides you might want to expand, remember Guy Kawasaki’s advice: 
use no more than ten slides unless there’s a really good reason to do so.
Your slide designer (even if it’s you) will do far better to produce eight lovely 
slides than thirty “death by PowerPoint” slides.
I find the act of describing what I need to a designer helps me to clarify my 
messages; the interrogation I get from a designer strengthens my message and 
sometimes exposes weaknesses in my story.
It also helps me with my timekeeping. When I begin to write a presentation, 
the first thing I do is to book a session with my favorite designer in—say—five 
days’ time. That makes me do everything else in the following five days—well, 
alright, sometimes in the fourth of five days.
Here’s a test of whether your slides are doing their job: can you tell the story 
just from the slide? If so, then you have too much information. Simplify the 
slides until they express only the most basic principle of your topic.

Appendix A | Case Study
76
There is one exception, often quoted, to this idea. In investment presentations, 
particularly in the finance sector, slides are used quite differently. The rest of 
you: no excuses.
You’ve probably seen the prompting systems that are on the front of every 
camera in a TV studio and used by CEOs, presidents, and celebrities to deliver 
speeches. Well used, they are a terrific way to give a professional presentation 
while not needing to commit the whole thing to memory.
But that’s not what slides are for.
When the presenter simply reads the slides to the audience, the slides fail for 
two reasons:
The first reason is that often presentations are done in 
• 
darkness, or at least subdued lighting. Our parents did 
a great job programming us by reading bedtime stories. 
Human beings are therefore often programmed by low 
light levels and someone reading to us; we go to sleep. 
Even if your audience are not actually asleep, they will 
certainly be drowsy.
The second reason is that we read faster than we speak. 
• 
Before you finished the first line of your slide, the audience 
has finished reading the whole slide and is now thinking 
about what to cook for dinner. You’ve lost them.
Either way, your slides are not supporting your message; they are detracting 
from it.
I explained to Barry that his slides are prompts for him. The simple statement 
that each slides contains will remind him of the next part of his talk; they will 
intrigue his audience and then build enlightenment as he explains why the 
abstract concept shown really supports his message. A presentation, like the 
telling of all good stories, will gradually unfold in the mind of your audience.
With other clients, this stage is where I sometimes help them to create the 
slides—often having a graphic designer attend the third session. However, I 
felt Barry was attached to his current slides and would have resisted. I had a 
printed copy of his slides to work on, and Barry started scribbling to reorder, 
edit, and delete those slides that did not now match his text.
It didn’t take long.
Barry even called his assistant and dictated the changes over the phone.
At the end, he had just 15 slides for his 20-minute presentation, but I felt there 
was more work we could do. The crucial slide, the one you use if there’s only 
time for one, was the final “call to action” slide.

The Introverted Presenter
77
Normally, in my opinion, if the slides tell the story, then they don’t do the job. 
A speaker who reads his slides is at a loss from the beginning because the 
audience can read much faster than the speaker can speak. The one exception 
to this rule is the final “call to action” slide. That slide will stay onscreen as 
you leave the stage; it’s the one thing your audience must remember. So, in that 
case, I believe in being very literal, unless there’s a reason not to. Obviously.
I shared my feelings about Barry’s slides, but we agreed to revisit them once 
his assistant had made the changes.
Step 8: Rehearsal
I then asked Barry to read through his script one more time. This time he 
needed to anchor those things he had done well, to get feedback, and to 
enhance his performance.
I was working with the experienced event producer Fran O’Linn when I heard 
her tell a client: “This is the rehearsal where we practice what we are going to 
do; it’s not where we decide what to do. You had that chance.”
Fran is an actress and strict task master; she would not allow changes after a 
certain point. I’m not sure I am so strict, but the point is well made.
Barry was beginning to embed his performance, to perform without thought, 
and further changes were likely to upset that.
We talked about Barry’s script. Some presenters like to put topic headings on 
3x5 cards, others like to have the script on the podium to read from, and still 
others like to commit everything to memory.
Barry decided to have his full script with him on the day. I gave him some 
techniques for successfully presenting from a script.
I didn’t mention how much he’d been against this at the start.
Some unprepared presenters can show the audience the top of their head 
when reading a script. They talk to the script, which means they talk as if the 
audience were 18 inches away. So, there’s no eye contact and a mumbling 
delivery.
The secret to delivering a presentation with a full script is to look down and 
see the next sentence and then look up and deliver that sentence to the 
audience. Then look down again.
As Barry had proved, he actually knew a lot of his speech, so the amount he 
needed to look down is quite slight. However, taking a moment of silence 
to look down can seem far too long to the speaker, but to the audience it’s 
completely natural.

Appendix A | Case Study
78
Barry was also worried that in his new role he might not be taken seriously. 
He was young for the role and would be addressing many people who were 
older than he was.
I suggested that his fear was only his concern.
Simply by standing at the podium Barry would be seen as an expert. This is 
one of the best reasons to cultivate a public speaking career. However, if that 
was not enough, I suggested Barry might like to consider delivering his speech 
more slowly.
Some of the most impressive speeches are made by people who speak very 
slowly. If you recall Martin Luther King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, he 
delivers the words incredibly slowly. Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela 
were also slow speakers and made all the more impact because of that.
By the time we’d worked through the rehearsal, the slides had been e-mailed 
back. One final run-through and a few tweaks and Barry was ready.
Well, I thought he was.
Step 9: Performance 
I spoke to Barry on the phone 24 hours before he was due to give his 
presentation. “Can you come over now?” he asked. I explained that it wasn’t 
really necessary—he was ready to present. But as it happened, I was coaching 
another presenter near the conference center where Barry was due to speak, 
so we met for coffee.
My job was to reassure Barry that he did know everything he needed to know. 
I asked him to give me the presentation sitting in the coffee area. Not only was 
he fairly word perfect, he even unconsciously twitched his finger every time a 
slide cue happened. We had several strange looks from the other customers 
in the coffee shop, none of which caused Barry to flinch. So, I’d checked my 
assumption that he was ready.
Barry had attended a rehearsal and had—at my suggestion—given control of 
the slides to the technician running the event. He really had nothing to worry 
about. But something in the morning had unnerved him.
I asked how the rehearsal had gone.
“Not bad. The technician was very nice and seemed surprised when I gave 
him a marked script. I stood on stage, but they only allowed me a soundcheck, 
not a full run-through. I offered to read through the speech for the technician, 
but he was quite dismissive. I’m not sure handing it over was the best thing.”
And I had it right there; Barry had relinquished control and was feeling the 
lack of it.

The Introverted Presenter
79
I always recommend giving control away to the technician if at all possible, 
assuming there is one. These people do this every day and will be far bet-
ter positioned to correct things if anything goes wrong—most mistakes in 
slide cueing happen because of a sweaty-fingered presenter nervously pushing  
buttons too often. I also believe that a laptop on the podium is yet another 
barrier between a presenter and the audience.
I told Barry that in this case I would normally tell him to practice some more, but 
his recitation was so close to the script, he need have no fear on that score.
“But I missed some bits.”
Actually, he didn’t leave anything out; he just paraphrased a bit. It was nothing  
that affected his final message, and it was nothing that the audience 
would notice.
When I first left home to study at drama school, I was lent an apartment by 
an actor while I found somewhere of my own to rent. My school friend Chris 
and I stayed in Balham in South London for a week before we found our first 
student house. In the apartment was a book called Cooking in a Bedsitter by 
Katherine Whitehorn full of valuable advice for living on your own, mostly 
about cooking but also a philosophy book for the newly independent. It con-
tained this advice: remember, there is no polite answer to the question 
“I forgot to do the mushrooms; would you have liked some?”
In the same way, if you alter your presentation on the fly or even forget a bit, 
no one in the audience will be any the wiser unless you draw attention to it. 
So, don’t.
Many years later I found myself sitting opposite Katherine Whitehorn at a 
restaurant and became a giggly fan attempting to express my gratitude. She 
was very gracious, but this clearly, unsurprisingly, happened a lot.
Barry wasn’t really calmed by my words of wisdom; he really wanted to take 
control of the slides back. I applied a bit of NLP asking him to imagine 
himself on stage with the excitement of delivering his finely honed words to 
the expectant crowd. Excitement and stage nerves are merely different sides 
of the same coin.
He admitted to feeling the excitement building in him. I asked what was best 
about the experience. “The connection with the audience,” he replied without 
any thought.
Fussing over stage props, slides, and everything else only gets in the way of that 
connection. Even if the slides go completely wrong, if the projector breaks, and 
if the slide technician dies backstage, you still have a story to tell that can be 
helped with slides but not ruined without them.
I told Barry to focus on his words, not anything else. The audience has come 
to hear him speak, not to watch him show some slides.

Appendix A | Case Study

What I think I do in most of my coaching relationships is to advise my clients 
where to put their attention at each stage of the process. When we do any-
thing that’s unfamiliar, our brains try to grab hold of the parts we think we 
know about. We veer away from the unfamiliar and consequently give it as 
little attention as we can. The coach’s job is to reverse this natural tendency.
Barry was focusing on his slides because, to him, that was the familiar ten-
dency. Taking that away from him forced him to think about the part he really 
didn’t want to do. By applying the thoughts of how the presentation could go, 
I hoped to get his neural pathways starting to focus on the important part of 
his performance.
We had talked—a lot—in all our sessions about the questions that would 
come from the floor. Barry was scared by this unplanned part of his presenta-
tion. There are quite a lot of strategies for handling questions, and I led him 
through the best for him.
Q&A
Repeat and Reframe
Answer the Questioner
Widen
Look for the next
The first strategy is to repeat the question. The questioner might not have 
a microphone, and the speaker probably does. This allows time to think and 
lets everyone in the room understand the question clearly. It also allows the 
speaker to check with the questioner that the question has been understood. 
In some cases, it allows the speaker to slightly reframe the question to be 
more applicable to the audience or easier to answer. Once that’s done, the 
speaker initially addresses the questioner, gradually widening the answer to 
include the whole room, leaving the questioner behind (discouraging follow-
up questions), and looking around for the next question.
The second strategy is that the speaker should not be afraid to take the con-
versation out of the room. “That’s a great question, but I’d like to talk to you 
in greater depth than we have time for here” allows the speaker to remove 
a grandstander, avoid discussing topics that are irrelevant to the audience, or 
avoid talking about things that should be kept confidential.
Third, it’s important to remember that it’s quite OK to say “I don’t know.” 
This is fine if you offer to find the answer and follow up with the questioner 
later. Of course, you really must follow up later.
I was awarded “favorite husband” status when I took my wife to a film industry 
screening of the film Ides of March. The screening was followed by a Q&A with 
members of the cast, including George Clooney. My wife asked a question 

The Introverted Presenter
81
that Mr. Clooney answered, to her delight addressing his long answer to her 
directly and seemingly ignoring everyone else in the room. Like I said, these 
are not rules, just guidelines. You can ignore these guidelines as appropriate, 
particularly if you’re George.
Step 10: Aftermath 
My mobile rang at 10:45. Barry was whispering into the phone. He sounded 
slightly drunk.
“I’m in the foyer; I don’t know what to do.”
I asked how the presentation went.
It was fine, and he’d returned to his seat but felt unable to stay in the auditorium.
I felt he needed permission. I gave it.
There’s a phenomenon I call horizon blindness, which afflicts many who work 
in the event business. I suspect anyone who is project based must have the 
same problem. We start out working on something that is three months away 
and carefully schedule resources to achieve the goal. As we work through the 
project, the goal becomes two months, six weeks, three weeks, ten days, five 
days, seventy-two hours away…and so on.
We think about nothing other than the looming deadline, which becomes 
ever more present until we get past the end of the project and feel slightly 
bemused because the process has continued as the deadline approaches: 
12 hours, 6 hours, 90 minute, 30 minutes, 5 minutes….
At the end we have to face what we are going to do with the rest of our life, 
and it’s a bit of a shock to the system.
Also, if, like me, you are an introvert, giving the presentation is—with 
practice—the least part of the problem. The coffee break afterward when 
everyone wants to speak to you is a real shocker.
Barry wasn’t prepared for his feelings after the presentation. I told him to go 
for a walk, take 45 minutes to walk around the block a few times, and be back 
in time for the next break—which was scheduled for noon.
I knew there would be people asking to speak to him. After all, that was the 
objective. He had business cards ready. I told him he should aim to be as trans-
actional as possible. Swap cards, agree to talk again, and move on to the next 
person. Focus on those people from overseas and set a time to talk to them 
immediately. Everyone else he should arrange later.
I then gave him the rest of the day off.
I don’t know what his boss might think about that, but I knew he’d be useless 
anyway.

Acknowledgments
This book would not have happened without all those “event tramps” I have 
had the pleasure to work with along the way in a career that has careened 
around the business that is show for many decades. You know who you are.
Mostly it is due to Katy Bird, who set me on this path without knowing she did 
so—and is sadly no longer with us to know what she did. Perhaps she does.
My wife, Fiona, is a tireless copy editor turning my random words into sense. 
She was ably succeeded by the terrific team at Apress, who can take comfort 
in their meager salaries. They surely deserve more, but Fiona didn’t get paid 
at all. Perhaps she might.
My children are a constant source of inspiration and were so excited that they 
might go to a book launch. Perhaps they might.
