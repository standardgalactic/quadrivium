About the Authors
For more than two decades, Katherine Murray has specialized in writing 
how-to books for general audiences on a variety of topics, ranging from busi-
ness to technology to parenting. A number of years ago, Katherine’s writing 
led her into the nonprofi t world, when she volunteered her research and 
writing skills to help selected nonprofi t organizations with missions close 
to her heart. Since that time, Katherine has completed a certifi cation in 
Fundraising Management from the IU Center on Philanthropy and become a 
kind of “fundraising coach” for small and struggling nonprofi ts. Katherine’s 
recent books include Green Home Computing For Dummies with coauthor 
Woody Leonhard (Wiley) and First Look Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2010 (Microsoft 
Press). As a member of the Society for Environmental Journalists, she 
writes articles and blogs about earth-care issues. You can follow Katherine’s

John Mutz is a fundraising expert and speaker who has an extensive array 
of fundraising credits. He was named 1997 Volunteer Fundraiser of the Year 
by the Indiana Chapter of National Association of Fundraising Professionals. 
In 1999, John served as Chairman of the United Way of Central Indiana, 
which raised more than $36.5 million. From 1996 to 1998, John served as 
Chairman of the Indianapolis Zoo, where he chaired a $14.5 million fundrais-

John was the president of the Lilly Endowment, one of the nation’s fi ve larg-
est private foundations, which supports the causes of religion, education, 
and community development. The Endowment included in its grant-making 
activity special grants intended to improve the fi nancial viability of non-
profi t organizations. During his time there, the Lilly Endowment made the 
grant that brought the Fundraising School to the Center on Philanthropy at 
Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). In addition, the 
Endowment initiated the GIFT program, which utilized matching and chal-
lenge grants to create a network of community foundations that now covers 
all 92 of Indiana’s counties.
In 1988, John was the Republican Candidate for Governor of Indiana, during 
which time he raised $4 million for the campaign. He is also co-founder of 
the Indiana Donor’s Alliance, a statewide organization of community founda-

munity foundations. John served as Indiana’s Lieutenant Governor from 1980

He currently serves as Board Chairman of Lumina Foundation for Education, 
a billion-dollar private foundation which supports access and success in 
post-high school education.

Introduction
C
hances are you were initially drawn to nonprofit work because of a 
cause you cared about — whether that cause was homeless families, 
environmental concerns, cutbacks in the arts, or public policy issues. You 
heard or saw something that touched your heart, and your mind opened 
up to the possibilities of doing something to help. Maybe your checkbook 
opened up, too.
Whether you wound up helping as a volunteer, joining a staff, or serving on 
a board, you most likely connected with the agency because, first and fore-
most, you believed in the work it was doing. At some point, you realized that 
the role of the fundraiser is right at the heart of the organization. After all, 
without funding, the agency wouldn’t be able to do any of the good work that 
got you hooked in the first place.
As you certainly know, fundraising in any economic climate is a challenge, 
but raising funds in a time of financial upheaval is a challenge of new pro-
portion. Not only is your organization vying with other groups for donors’ 
attention, compassion, and financial gifts, but now you must swim against 
the tide of economic uncertainty, reduced assets, and general insecurity in 
the market. How do you encourage donors to give when they’re fearful about 
their finances? How can you demonstrate the good stewardship of your 
group and share your success stories — all while reducing costs and further-
ing your reach? Is it possible to connect with your donors in new ways during 
economic hardship, honoring their contributions and inviting their engage-
ment no matter how big the check they write today is?
Fundraising For Dummies, 3rd Edition, answers these questions and many 
more, offering practical, tried-and-true ways to raise the funds you need in 
any financial landscape. Whether you run a one-person development office or 
chair a 20-member board of directors, this book walks you through the pro-
cess of assessing your fundraising climate, getting ready to raise funds, pre-
paring a far-reaching fundraising plan, gathering your resources, and putting 
your plan in place. Additionally, this book shows you how to find and work 
with donors, set up a variety of fundraising campaigns, and explore effective, 
low-cost ways — such as reducing your four-color print budget and begin-
ning to use social marketing techniques — to get the word out about the 
good your organization is doing in your community and around the world.

Fundraising For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
About This Book
No matter where you are on your fundraising journey, this book is here to 
help you find just what you need. You don’t have to read it cover to cover 
to find value, but we do suggest that you start by taking a look at Chapter 1, 
which gives you a sense of the factors that influence raising funds in a shift-
ing economic landscape. Then feel free to wander where your interests and 
most urgent needs lead you. When we cover a particular topic in more detail 
elsewhere in the book, we include a cross-reference so you can easily jump 
from chapter to chapter to read up on the areas that interest you most.
Throughout the book, we strive to make ideas and phrases easy to under-
stand, putting things in simple terms with advice straight from the school of 
practical experience. The idea is to give you effective fundraising techniques 
fast — ideas you can put in place right away — without requiring you to 
spend a lot of time with complicated concepts that will rarely, if ever, affect 
what you do in real-world fundraising for your organization.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use the following conventions consistently throughout the book:
 
✓ New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
✓ Boldface text either indicates keywords in bulleted lists or highlights 
action parts of numbered steps.
 
✓ All Web and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If you come across a two-line Web address, rest 
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indi-
cate the break. So when you’re using one of these Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars — the gray boxes set apart from the regular text — are side topics 
that may be interesting but aren’t exactly essential to the fundraising topics 
at hand. Sidebars may point out the background of a term or practice, for 
example, or give you additional details on a topic mentioned in the text. If 
you want to speed through the book and skip the sidebars, go ahead; no need 
to feel guilty.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
We made some assumptions about you as we wrote this book. Basically, we 
think the following:
 
✓ You’re a current or aspiring fundraiser.
 
✓ You’re feeling the impact of the shifting economy and want practical 
ideas for effective fundraising.
 
✓ Whether you have 20 years of experience or are just starting out, 
you’d like some fresh ideas and advice that will help you use the best 
approaches and technologies available today.
 
✓ You may be anyone from a full-time staff member to a volunteer charged 
with fundraising tasks.
 
✓ You don’t have a huge staff or open-ended budget.
 
✓ You care about the mission you’re raising funds to support and want to 
make a positive difference.
 
✓ You don’t have time to waste; you need to get to work right away with 
ideas and tools that can help you succeed.
How This Book Is Organized
Fundraising For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is organized into five different parts, 
with chapters arranged to walk you (more or less) through the process of 
preparing for, creating, implementing, and evaluating a cohesive fundraising 
system.
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising 
Ducks in a Row
Part I is all about your readiness — as an agency — to set up a fundraising 
system. Long before you start taking those checks to the bank, you need to 
make sure your organization is ready to raise funds. Getting ready involves 
gaining a sense of the climate in which you’re planning to raise funds and 
identifying the factors that may impact your efforts. It also means getting a 
clear sense of the organization. What’s your organization’s mission? Why do 
you do what you do? Whom does your agency help? What does your board 
do? This part of the book helps you evaluate and answer these questions — 
and many more — to make sure that you are, in fact, ready to roll out your 
own fundraising plan.

Fundraising For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part II: Finding — and Winning 
Over — Donors
Part II introduces the all-important donor and helps you understand what 
role he or she plays in the effectiveness of your overall fundraising plan. Who 
are your donors and where can you find them? What motivates a donor to 
give? How can you lessen your chances of hearing “No!” on your donor calls? 
How equitable is the agency-donor relationship? How can you write a win-
ning grant proposal that speaks directly to the grantor about the good your 
organization does (and how a grant would help you do even more)? This part 
introduces you to these donor-related aspects of any fundraising system and 
helps you prepare for your eventual dialog with your donors.
Part III: Telling Your Story 
and Building Your Brand
Much of your work as a fundraiser involves telling the story of your orga-
nization in a compelling and engaging way. Whether you’re sending mail 
pieces, working with the media, writing grant proposals, using social media 
and e-mail approaches, or updating your Web site, understanding what your 
donors see, hear, and think about your organization is key to ensuring that 
you’re building the brand value you hope to create. When your name and 
work are synonymous with compassion, quality, service, and good work, 
your donors will be glad to be part of your organization and will undoubtedly 
want to get closer. This part helps you use all these means — and more — to 
engage your donors in a way that enables them to give gladly.
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers 
with the Right Campaigns
As a fundraiser, you find out quickly that different campaigns enable you to 
connect with different types of donors in different ways. You fund your year-
in, year-out operations with your annual fund. You purchase new playground 
equipment with the help of a special event. You build the new library build-
ing thanks to the dollars raised for the capital campaign. You can go after 
major gifts from corporations and foundations, or you can decide to build an

 Introduction
endowment for longer-term financial security. This part explores these dif-
ferent campaigns and provides advice about when you should use each cam-
paign, what to expect from them, and how to evaluate the campaigns so you 
can do more of what works next time.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In typical For Dummies fashion, this part of the book lists a few collections of 
ten items, grouped around a particular subject. Chapter 24 offers ten inter-
esting ideas about changes on the fundraising horizon that may impact your 
work in the years to come. Chapter 25 offers great opening lines that you can 
use to engage your donors right off the bat. You never know when one may 
come in handy.
Icons Used in This Book
If you’ve ever used a For Dummies book before, you know that each book 
has a lot of little pictures on the pages, showing you what’s special and 
important about a particular paragraph. Here are the icons we use through-
out this book:
 
Anything having to do with money, people, and time lends itself to analysis. 
This icon draws attention to quantifiable ways that the fundraising landscape 
has changed over time.
 
This icon highlights useful concepts and practical information.
 
Basic “how-to-do-it-better” ideas appear with this icon so you can do things 
correctly from the start.
 
Pay close attention to the information listed with this icon, or your fundraising 
campaign could be a bomb.

Where to Go from Here
Well, you could take the afternoon off and go watch the Cubs play . . . but 
more than likely you’re now fired up and ready to tackle some of the fund-
raising issues you face. Before you begin, however, review the following fund-
raising truths:
 
✓ Fundraising starts with passion.
 
✓ People want to give — even in tough economic times.
 
✓ You help donors achieve their goals. (Giving truly is good for both the 
donor and the organization.)
 
✓ Fundraising is a noble endeavor.
Don’t believe these truths? By the time you’re done reading this book, you 
will. In the meantime, sit back, feel confident that you’re not alone out there 
in the big world of fundraising, and enjoy your trip through Fundraising For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition. Feel free to start at the beginning, or move to the 
topics that interest you most. Go wherever your fundraising heart takes you!

efore you can start bringing in the big bucks to 
fund your organization, you need to begin at the 
beginning — by figuring out the lay of the land and get-
ting a sense of what’s possible in your fundraising envi-
ronment. Anytime you start something new, you have to 
take some time to get your feet under you and become 
familiar with the basics of your task. And in times of 
economic upheaval, being able to assess your starting 
point — and envision your end goal — is more important 
than ever.
This part of the book introduces you to the foundation of 
your fundraising efforts: your passion, your mission, your 
board, and your message. Use this part to put the corner-
stones in place as you begin building your fundraising 
approach.

hances are you love a challenge. You probably also enjoy people, have 
a passion for your cause, have skills that help you communicate easily, 
are personable, and know how to focus on details while keeping in mind the 
big picture. In your heart of hearts, you also may have a never-say-die belief 
that good causes need good people to raise the funds that keep them going.
Congratulations! You’re in the right line of work.
Fundraising may not be the easiest job you ever do in your life, but, as you 
gain understanding and experience, you discover that it offers great intrinsic 
and lasting rewards: relationships with passionate and dedicated people; 
the achievement of goals for a cause you believe in; the excitement of know-
ing your efforts are contributing to the common good — by way of putting 
food on the table for those who are hungry, opening doors for those who 
need them, or cleaning up the environment for the next generation. All along 
the way, you have the chance to be a matchmaker of good works and good 
people — bringing together people who have a desire to help with an organi-
zation that needs them.
Even with all these inherent benefits, however, now isn’t an easy time to be a 
fundraiser. If you’ve been in the role for any length of time, you’ve probably 
spent a lot of time watching with a wary eye as the economy pitches and 
sways. You wonder whether donors will have anything left to give; you watch

Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
your endowment drop; you cringe at the economic forecasts. After all, in 
almost every industry today — education, healthcare, social services, environ-
mental protection, public service, and so on — you find giving numbers down, 
corporations tightening their purse strings, foundations offering fewer grants, 
and government dollars slowing to a trickle.
Although it’s important to have your eyes open, to know what’s happening 
in the world, and to discern how the current economic situation is impacting 
your organization, not everything is doom and gloom. As you see in the world 
around you, times of disequilibrium find their way back to balance. As the 
economy shifts and topples, you get the opportunity to look more closely at 
your foundation, your approach, your programs, your messaging, and your 
people. You now have the time to give a closer look to the areas you took for 
granted when times were good. How has your organization changed? What 
are your opportunities today? How can you work together with your staff and 
board more effectively — while improving your efficiency and cutting costs 
at the same time — so that when the numbers begin to rise again (and they 
will), you’re ready to move even more effectively into a time of abundance?
This chapter offers practical in-the-trenches ideas for navigating through 
tough times, capitalizing on your successes, and planting seeds now for some 
major blossoming in the months and years ahead.
Looking at the Stark Realities
Just how bad is it? According to the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana 
University, the Philanthropic Giving Index (PGI), which evaluates confidence 
in charitable giving, reached an all-time low in 2009, dropping almost 49 per-
cent since December 2007. When the PGI was calculated in the depths of the 
U.S. recession, more than 93 percent of fundraisers said the economy had a 
negative or very negative effect on their ability to raise funds.
Even though the numbers show that donors who traditionally have given less 
than $1,000 are giving roughly the same amount they gave in previous years, 
donors who traditionally have given more than $1,000 are being impacted in 
a big way, and the size and number of gifts they are giving have been signifi-
cantly reduced. Uncertainty is in the air, and even your more affluent donors 
may be experiencing difficult personal economic circumstances.
 
Giving USA 2009, a report showing the results of philanthropic giving in 2008, 
illustrates just how bleak the numbers really are. Compared to the philan-
thropic giving total for 2007 (just over $314 billion), total giving in 2008 was 

11
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
just over $307 billion, a drop of 5.7 percent (adjusted for inflation). Individual 
giving — which represents a full 75 percent of all philanthropic gifts — 
dropped 6.3 percent.
In most industry areas, fundraisers aren’t surprised that giving is down — in 
some cases, with dramatic drops. Here’s a quick tally of the drops in giving 
from 2008 to 2009 in a selection of industry areas:
 
✓ Arts, culture, and humanities: Down 9.9 percent
 
✓ Education: Down 9 percent
 
✓ Environment/animals: Down 9 percent
 
✓ Human services: Down 15.9 percent
 
✓ Health services: Down 10 percent
 
✓ International affairs: Down 3.1 percent
For religious organizations and those categorized as public-society benefit 
groups (for example, civil rights’ organizations, community-improvement 
groups, and disaster-relief organizations), the numbers were slightly better:
 
✓ Religious organizations: Up 1.6 percent
 
✓ Public-society benefit groups: Up 1.5 percent
This means that unless you work in one of the few groups with an increase 
in giving, you are likely feeling the pinch in tough economic times, no matter 
where you’re fundraising, how well-known your organization may be, or how 
many successful campaigns you’ve run. Yet, even though the funds available 
for your services seem to be stretching thin at times, the need for services 
isn’t lacking in the slightest — in fact, the needs are undoubtedly increasing 
faster than you can supply them.
 
It’s important to balance the dismal facts and figures that accompany eco-
nomic downturns with a larger sense of the ebb and flow of philanthropic 
work. Money may be tight right now, but the number of people who care 
about your cause isn’t in short supply. Being able to tell your story in a pos-
itive way that clearly shows others how they can help is an important first 
step toward fulfilling your mission in any economy. With a little creativity, 
vision, collaboration, and passion, you may find that you can easily do 
more with less — while serving a greater number of people than you’d pre-
viously thought possible.
In the following sections, we outline some of the difficulties your organization 
may be facing and point you in the right direction for coping with them.

12
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Identifying cutbacks and understanding 
the reasons for them
Nothing about the fundraising climate today is business as usual. Giving is 
down, and, although an upswing is certainly on the way, nobody knows when 
with any certainty. This basic fact brings us to three stark realities that every 
fundraiser needs to recognize in times of economic challenge:
 
✓ Reality 1: Giving is down.
 
✓ Reality 2: Personal income is down.
 
✓ Reality 3: Government expenditures are down.
As a fundraiser, these three realities add up to the realization that unless 
your organization hits it big with a major event, gets a huge grant you’ve 
been working on for a while, or suddenly discovers a sleigh full of major 
donors who are intact financially and ready and willing to give, your dona-
tions are likely to be lower than forecasted during an economic slump. The 
main reason for this slump in donations is Reality 2, the fact that personal 
income is down — no matter where or how you make (or made) a living. 
People actively working in every industry work harder and make less 
because costs are elevated. People who had counted on investment income 
have taken a big hit and may be more concerned today about making major 
gifts. To top it all off, if you’re an organization that relies less on people for 
donations and more on government support for your programs and services, 
you may find that your program has been reduced, underfunded, or even cut 
off from your source of state or federal funding.
To help you navigate these choppy waters, we’ve included information in 
Chapter 8 on how to connect with your donors in a variety of low-cost, high-
impact ways. Chapter 11 helps you think through your approach for writing 
engaging, inspiring grant proposals, and all chapters in Part IV focus on spe-
cific campaigns you can use to approach your donors in different ways.
Coping with staff reductions 
and shrinking budgets
Watching contributions slip and investment values fall inevitably strikes a cold 
fear in the heart of every nonprofit leader and fundraising team. Sure, the idea 
of reducing programs and services is a difficult one. But the toughest calls of 
all — for organizations founded on the idea of people helping people — are 
the ones that impact the lives of the people you serve and the friends and col-
leagues you work with. Does a decision you feel you have to make to cope with 
the current economic state mean that staff won’t get a raise this year? That 
some open positions will go unfilled? That layoffs are on the horizon?

13
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
In Chapter 5, we show you how to help your board tackle the tough decisions 
so you know what to plan for and what to expect. You may be surprised to 
find a little breathing room and discover that you can chart a course that is 
open and honest and that builds trust throughout the entire organization, 
even — and perhaps especially — in the midst of trying times.
 
You may not be able to give staff a raise this year, but you can offer other ben-
efits to offset that loss. Depending on the way your organization is structured, 
you may be able to offer flex time, give an extra personal day, or change other 
perks that don’t relate to an increase in the bottom line.
Dealing with hard times that linger
One of the biggest challenges in economic uncertainty is that the forecasting 
models that worked in the past don’t seem to fit — and you don’t know exactly 
what to expect. What can you do to prepare and preserve your organization 
if digging out of the recession takes longer than expected? What if your dona-
tions are down for another 6 months — or 12, or 24?
Whether recovery comes quickly or eases in slowly over time, the smart 
thing to do is begin where you are today with a good, clear look at the build-
ing blocks of your organization. We show you how to prepare and preserve 
your organization with your case statement in Chapter 4, and then we show 
you how to use it to build a full fundraising plan in Chapter 6.
Ready for the good news?
Are you ready for some good news? In his book 
Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville 
wrote that people generally rise to the occa-
sion presented to them. Most people have 
seen evidence of this phenomenon in their 
lives, whether it’s in a neighborhood rallying 
for a sick child, a community raising funds for 
an after-school program, or dramatic and per-
sonal humanitarian efforts like the many people 
who dropped everything to help the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina.
On the one hand, you have to face the facts and 
figures and deal with the dire predictions and 
circumstances that accompany down econo-
mies. But on the other hand, you’ve got the 
history and culture of what countless people 
have done in America to combat bad times in 
the past. Somehow or another, when times 
are tough, individuals and organizations alike 
develop more compassion for those in need and 
for those causes that are important for society. 
Your organization can do the same today as you 
figure out how to do a better job of working with 
what you’ve got — doing more with less.
All the hardship you’re dealing with now offers 
you countless lessons to learn, and it may even 
result in a more efficient, focused, and stream-
lined organization. As your make your way over 
the many hurdles, you gather lots of wisdom 
from the experience. Plus — and this is icing 
on the cake — when things begin to get better, 
you’ll have one heck of a good story to tell.

Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Finding reliable sources
One of the big shocks — and even bigger lessons — of the recession of 2009 
is that as a society we need to be willing to look more closely at where we 
place our trust. Large corporations that seemed to be operating ethically 
and efficiently floundered and fell when bad lending practices put everyone 
at risk. As we begin to pull together our recovery, the question of where we 
place our trust remains. Donors will be asking you the same thing. Who’s 
a reliable source? On what information will you base your major financial 
decisions? Can your organization be counted on? Will your organization be 
around tomorrow? Next month? Next year?
In Chapter 3, we offer a number of resources to help you steer your organiza-
tion effectively using ethical principles in fundraising. In that chapter, you 
discover a number of organizations that are designed to uphold the best 
ideals in fundraising, made up of people who work to guarantee that — 
troubled times or not — fundraising remains a noble endeavor.
Finding Your Opportunity: A Crisis 
Is Too Good to Waste
Even though at times the challenges you face as a fundraiser may feel more 
like mountains than molehills, you cross all challenges the same way: one 
step at a time. Wherever your organization finds itself — in financial peril, in 
economic uncertainty, or with lower-than-expected donations and few pros-
pects for grant funding — you can find a path to more solid ground. Use the 
measures presented in the following sections to begin to restore a sense of 
stability.
Revisiting your mission
Your current situation offers you opportunities to look more closely at the 
programs and services you offer and to get clear about your priorities and 
positions. You can fine-tune your case statement, revisit your mission, get 
your board engaged, and maybe bring in some great new volunteers.
In Chapters 4 through 6, we show you how to shine a light on your programs 
and services and reprioritize so the programs that meet the biggest need in 
your community right now are the ones that get your attention. By getting 
clear on your mission and exploring creative and innovative ways to deliver 
the programs and services that meet your goals, you streamline your efforts, 
which helps you do more of what works — and less of what doesn’t.

15
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
Paring your services (or pairing 
up to provide them!)
By definition, focusing on some services means giving less attention and 
effort to others. How can you help your organization decide what to keep and 
what to drop? Chapter 5 offers an exercise to help you evaluate your options.
In some cases, you may be able to fulfill your mission by keeping all your 
programs and services alive through a creative partnership or merger. Today 
organizations are teaming up like never before to share costs, reduce over-
head, and get more done. Find out more about teaming up with other organi-
zations in Chapter 6.
 
Collaboration isn’t a new idea in nonprofit work, but many organizations still 
like to run their own shows when it comes to delivering programs and ser-
vices. If you can team up with another organization to meet the needs of a 
greater number of people at a reduced cost, go for it. Besides helping you 
serve more people, working together with other organizations also improves 
your overall image in the eyes of grantors (the organizations or foundations 
who offer grants to organizations like you), which can significantly boost your 
bottom line. After all, foundations like to see cooperative efforts on the grant 
proposals you submit. (Find out more about grants in Chapter 11.)
Nurturing the donor-agency relationship
In down economic times, it’s more important than ever to know your donor. 
Research the giving patterns of your constituents, find out what life is like for 
your regular donor, stay in touch with your major givers, and use your mes-
saging to reassure, inform, and invite donors to stay engaged with you. Check 
out Chapters 7 through 10 to discover everything you need to know about 
researching and cultivating your relationships with your donors.
Make sure your messaging is empathetic and honest — but stay away from 
crying “Wolf!” too often. However, when the need is real, dramatizing a com-
munity crisis can be an effective way to gather new donors and encourage 
those who have given in the past to give again. For example, a food pantry 
recently discovered it was going to come up short in supply of its needs, 
so the board enlisted the support of the local mayor. This added support 
resulted in lots of free media and an uptake in giving.
 
Crying “Wolf!” may work once in a while (especially when someone in your 
community is truly in dire need), but overusing dramatic urgency can leave 
your donors underimpressed. Better to be straightforward, present the oppor-
tunities, and invite your donors to be part of your cause.

16
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
You can reduce the anxiety your staff and donors may be feeling for any 
number of reasons simply by being candid (although being candid does take a 
little courage). When you use candor with kindness to address the situation 
directly, people feel relief to know the straight story — even if it’s not good 
news — and they usually feel they can trust what you’re telling them.
Turning to cost-effective processes
In the middle of a thriving economic time, people tend to build on programs 
and services, layer new ideas over the tried-and-true, and take on expenses in 
a generally optimistic frame of mind. When money gets tight, people constrict 
that expansiveness and begin to look more closely at what they spend and 
why. This kind of close evaluation is really a good thing for your organization 
to do periodically, whether or not it accompanies financial hardship.
By scrutinizing the giving patterns and donation flow in your organization, 
you can get a sense of which campaigns during the year have worked in the 
past and make some estimation of what may work again. You can also find 
out more about the who, what, when, where, and how of special events and 
explore areas in your organization where you tend to spend a lot of your 
money (in four-color print pieces, for example). After you identify what pro-
cesses you’ve been using to fulfill your organization’s mission, you can look 
for ways to make those processes more cost effective.
In Chapters 14 through 17, we show you how to build community, get your 
message out, increase the visibility of your brand, and build your online pres-
ence by using free or low-cost tools that reach an ever-widening audience 
(for literally a fraction of the cost you’re paying for print pieces).
In Chapter 19, we show you how to use another low-cost tool — Webinars — 
to share your organization with potential donors. Webinars provide a great 
opportunity to reduce heavy travel expenses for everyone in your organiza-
tion while making meetings more flexible and time-effective. For a low cost, 
you can host an online session with presentations, a whiteboard, video, and 
other programs, while your organization’s leaders talk by phone.
Talking Up Your Successes and 
Building Relationships
It’s been said that it is human nature to create — we create with our ideas, 
our thoughts, our words, and our actions. When you talk up your recent suc-
cesses, no matter how small they might be, you inspire the people listening 

17
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
to think positively about your organization. When you’re the voice of stabil-
ity in a time of great change, you paint the possibility of better times in your 
listeners’ minds. When you make a real effort to build relationships with your 
donors — simply to build the relationship, whether they choose to donate or 
not — your donors realize that you value more than their financial contribu-
tion, which makes a huge difference in the amount of goodwill they feel for 
your organization and perhaps for you personally. One day that goodwill may 
convert to a dollar amount — or it may lead other potential donors to your 
door. The following sections discuss some key points to keep in mind as you 
promote your organization.
Telling your story well
Especially when daily news is filled with negativity, people love to hear a 
good story. Lucky for you, your organization likely gives you lots of positive 
stories to tell — people who have been helped by what you do, volunteers 
who love their work, improvements you have made, lives you have changed. 
Although these good things may happen against a backdrop of short-fall 
funding and delayed grants, share your successes out loud with your donors, 
your staff, and your public.
In Chapters 12 and 13, we show you how to tell the stories of the good things 
that are going on in your organization. We explain how to make a splash in 
print (through your annual report), take your stories online, and even post 
them in videos.
 
Whether you’re a lone fundraiser in your organization or you work with a team 
or committee, prepare a weekly dashboard that shows what donations came 
in, what expenses went out, and what kind of progress you’re making. This 
simple data serves as a quick-look guide to show your progress week by week; 
plus, it gets your whole team engaged in the effort of recognizing and talking 
about your organization’s successes — big or small.
Engaging people who care
People who cared about your organization before the economic downturn 
still care about it today — they just may be less certain about their own abili-
ties to give. You can help your donors recognize the many ways they can give 
to your cause by staying in touch with them through e-mail, phone calls, and 
the Web — even during economic downturns. Stick with your normal pattern 
of communication, whatever that may be. Consistency is important in build-
ing donor relationships, and your donors will be paying careful attention to 
the way you navigate through this rocky time.

18
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
You can be creative about the ways in which you invite your donors to par-
ticipate in your cause by increasing the number of giving options, spotlight-
ing volunteering, offering matched-giving opportunities, or hosting low-cost, 
service-related events that enable donors to socialize and find out more 
about your organization. Chapter 8 shows you how to get to know your 
donors in a way that makes helping out your organization a natural next step.
Developing relationships with 
key businesses and funders
Corporate philanthropy takes a hit just like everything else in tumultuous 
economic times, but the corporate citizen also has a vested interest in doing 
good — both for tax reasons and for the general goodwill and morale of 
employees. Continuing to develop good relationships with businesses in your 
area or industry is important, and continuing to talk with potential major 
givers is a given. Chapter 22 takes a closer look at corporate philanthropy, 
and Chapters 9 and 21 show you what you need to do to cultivate those 
important major givers and secure their gifts.
Meet as usual with your potential business sponsors and constituents — 
communicate, communicate, communicate. If you can find that perfect 
match — just the right fit for a particular corporate-giving program, for 
example — you may be surprised to discover how many people truly want 
to give, even though they feel limited in how much they can give right now. 
Over time, a $15-a-month donation may increase to five or ten times that 
amount.
Doing Your Best to Bring In the Dollars
Just because the numbers are down and people are forecasting difficult days 
doesn’t mean you can’t keep trying. During economically tough times, it’s 
more important than ever to ramp up your fundraising energy, double your 
efforts, and stay in a positive frame of mind. Spending just as much time and 
energy as you always have in cultivating relationships, telling your story, 
looking for good fits, and managing your expenses effectively will pay off in 
the long run. Here are just a few of the ways you can make your hard work 
pay off in tough times:

19
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
 
✓ Reduce costs on your annual fund drive by replacing most or all of your 
print appeals with e-mail.
 
✓ Improve your Web site and make it possible for donors to give online.
 
✓ Participate in community events to help keep your organization in the 
public eye.
 
✓ Be willing to partner with other organizations who have similar or com-
plementary missions.
 
✓ Say thank you — graciously (even if you’re only getting a portion of what 
you’d hoped for).
 
✓ Come up with creative, low-cost special events that help people social-
ize while doing something good for your organization.
 
✓ Be willing to share your challenges with others and enlist their help in 
reaching your goals.
 
Chapters 14 through 17 show you how to reduce your print costs by moving 
many of your fundraising efforts online. These chapters also explain how to 
get listed in charity portals and work with online affinity groups. Chapter 19 is 
all about creating attention-getting special events (while keeping an eye on 
your budget).
Preparing Now for When 
Things Start Looking Up
As you can see, many of the challenges fundraisers face right now are really 
opportunities in disguise. A chance to streamline programs and processes. 
An opportunity to focus on what really matters. An invitation to take a look 
at the mission statement, goals, and objectives of your organization to see 
whether you need to update them, renovate them, or throw them out and 
rewrite them completely.
You can position your organization to be prepared for the good times that 
will return (sooner or later) by completing some of the tasks we present 
in the next section. If you’re still unsure about how your organization will 
face the challenges ahead, the final section in this chapter may provide the 
encouragement you need to forge ahead.

Laying the groundwork to take advantage 
of an economic recovery
What can you do now to get your organization ready to make the most of the 
good times when they return? Here are just a few ideas:
 
✓ Get your case statement in sterling shape (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Take a look at your organizational chart — is your organization set up to 
run efficiently?
 
✓ Build your donor relationships, day by day (see Part II).
 
✓ Make sure your communications are clear, honest, and mission-driven 
(see Part III).
 
✓ Figure out how to use social networking technologies to build commu-
nity and goodwill (see Chapter 14).
 
✓ Consider partnering with another organization to share costs and 
increase visibility.
 
✓ Consider adding a contingency fund in next year’s budget.
 
✓ Replace much of your print expenses by using e-mail for letters and 
newsletters (see Chapter 15).
 
✓ Expand what you offer on your Web site, and provide more information 
for donors and readers (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Build your brand and use it everywhere (see Chapter 17).
 
✓ Invite donor feedback to welcome your donors’ engagement with your 
organization (and be sure to acknowledge and use the feedback you get).
As you prepare your organization for the recovery that’s sure to come, be 
sure to take a look at Chapter 24, which offers a glimpse into fundraising in 
the future. Optimism is in order — better days are ahead!
 
In Chapter 5, we invite you to plot the history of your organization. What you 
likely discover as you create your organization’s timeline is that you or your 
predecessors have survived downturns before like the one you’re in now. 
Your organization has, indeed, risen to difficult times in the past and over-
come them, and, ultimately, things did improve. What’s more, the difficult 
times in the past and those you experience today give your organization the 
chance to witness the creativity, compassion, and collaboration that shows up 
when people face challenges together.

21
 Chapter 1: Fundraising in a Changing Economy
Moving forward with hope
Before we jump headfirst into the many fundraising approaches available 
to you, we take a look at two stories that offer slightly different approaches 
to fundraising in tough times. Consider what these two organizations did to 
survive the challenging trials that faced them, and then read the rest of this 
book to find out what you can do to help your own organization make the 
most of fundraising in both good times and bad.
Giving from a belief in abundance
A local church decided that good work isn’t done only by churches but 
rather is done by lots of nonprofit organizations. As a result, the church 
decided to set aside 10 percent of the collections it received each Sunday 
and donate that amount to a local nonprofit. The immediate reaction of the 
leadership team and the pastor to this idea was “We’re barely making it 
now — this is a hand-to-mouth organization!” However, after considering the 
options — and trying to answer honestly the question “Do we believe we live 
in an abundant society?” — they went ahead with the plan. To this day, this 
church has never missed a payroll and continues to donate 10 percent of 
its weekly donations to local nonprofit organizations. The minister used to 
call John (one of the authors of this book) and say, “John, I had to write that 
check and I thought, ‘I can’t do it . . . I can’t do it!’ But I did it anyway, and the 
money came.”
No matter what your mission may be or which constituency you serve, 
taking a good look at where your principles align — as individuals and as an 
organization — gives you the opportunity to see whether your actions are in 
alignment with your beliefs. Do you believe your good work will ultimately 
be funded? Are you generous to other organizations with missions similar 
to your own, in terms of sharing community interest, expressing goodwill, 
and being willing to collaborate when possible? Examine your own attitudes 
about nonprofit work and consider what kinds of belief statements your orga-
nization makes through its daily operating practices.
Creativity and the power of collaboration
When John took on the role of lieutenant governor for the state of Indiana 
in 1980, the nation was deep in an economic downturn. Everything was in 
double-digits: inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. As the new admin-
istration sought creative ways to respond to the widespread challenges, it 
realized that helping communities develop their economic potential was 
a powerful way to plant good seeds during a time of struggle. In communi-
ties all over the state, John and his staff gathered the nonprofit community 

22
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
(including faith-based organizations), the business community, and govern-
ment representatives and presented a plan for a local economic development 
initiative that helped communities (1) identify the community’s assets; (2) 
identify the people in the community who could be enlisted to help (vol-
unteer leaders who get things done); and (3) identify funders who could 
contribute to the initiative. More than 165 Local Economic Development 
Corporations (LEDOs) were born during that difficult time, and they’re still 
operating today. The inspired idea helped these communities stop wringing 
their hands and begin to move forward by recognizing their assets, mobiliz-
ing their talent, and beginning to build for the future.
When dire times call for creative measures, you can trust the fact that people 
rise to the creative challenge. In your organization, you may be fretting about 
many things, but one thing is certain: If you’re inviting and listening to the 
input of people who care about your cause and are dedicated to your mis-
sion, new ideas will arise. And you will know you have a winning idea when it 
includes the creative and collaborative effort of many people and brings the 
best to the table for both your organization and the people you serve.
Weathering the storm
As you know well, the fundraising landscape today is full of sand traps and 
snake pits and unseen twists and turns. Eventually, the way will feel easier 
and the path will look clearer, but when you encounter moments of challenge, 
you find the resources — internal and external — that you need to accomplish 
your mission. People mobilize to help you. Opportunities pop up unexpectedly. 
New programs bring new donors. And the good work continues.
 
It’s your job as your organization’s fundraiser to put all the ideas you get from 
your donors, your board, your volunteers, your staff, and yourself to work 
through fundraising approaches that honor your mission, respect your donor, 
tell your story, and invite dedication and commitment to your cause.

Chapter 2
Identifying the Fruits of Your 
Fundraising Passion
In This Chapter
▶ Finding the spark that first brought you to nonprofit work
▶ Building service with passion
▶ Plugging in with social media
F
undraising folks have an old saying: “People don’t give to causes. People 
give to people with causes.” This saying means, in essence, you’re one of 
the most important parts of the fundraising process. Your inspiration, your 
perspiration, your passion. So now comes the hard part: What are you pas-
sionate about?
Chances are good that passion for a particular cause led you to fundraising 
in the first place. Oh, sure, you find professional fundraisers out in the field 
who are interested first and foremost in turning a fast buck. But those people 
are few and far between in our experience. People are drawn to organizations 
because they see a need — perhaps up close and personal — and because they 
feel compelled to do what they can to make a difference. When you’re part of 
a mission that’s close to your heart, the potential for creative effort and action 
increases and others are inspired and attracted to what you’re doing.
Not only is that spark of passion the driving force behind your desire to help, 
but it’s also one of the best tools you can use as you fan the embers of pos-
sibility into a full fundraising flame. When you’re trying to fundraise in uncer-
tain economic times, plugging in to your own passion — why you do what 
you do — is a vitally important part of telling your organization’s story with 
the energy that captures people’s attention.
In this chapter, we take a look at having and staying in touch with that initial 
spark that brought about the birth of your organization, that keeps it going, 
and that you caught and are helping to flame. We also show you how to fan 
the flame to ignite others for your cause, give you the rundown on some 
basic fundraising lingo, and reveal just how many nonprofits you’re compet-
ing against to raise funds (so you know just how vast the industry is). And 

24
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
for those of you who are just breaking into the nonprofit world, we give you 
some advice on maintaining the buzz. Finally, we give you a taste of how to 
use social media to build excitement about your organization.
Sparking Fundraising Action
As anyone who’s ever had any experience with trying to raise money can 
attest, fundraising isn’t a pretty word. In fact, it’s a tough term to confront, a 
kind of oh-no-here-comes-the-pitch word. Some people say that fundraising is 
really friend-raising, but saying that is like putting a bit of polish on an other-
wise slippery surface.
Nonetheless, fundraising is a necessary part of any nonprofit organization — 
the part that puts the hinges on the doors so people can open them and the 
part that keeps the blankets on the beds and the food in the pantry. It pays 
the salary for the midwife, helps the senior citizen find affordable medication, 
and provides the day-camp scholarships for inner-city kids.
But fundraising isn’t the main objective of a nonprofit organization, although 
you may sometimes feel like it gets the bulk of the focus. Fundraising is the 
means to an end, the way to fulfill your mission, whether that mission is 
reaching people who are homeless or in need, healing the sick, or promoting 
the art or music you’re passionate about.
 
Taking the time to think through beliefs about money in general and fundrais-
ing in particular is important because your unexplored ideas may — for better 
or worse — affect your overall success in your role. When you consider the 
biases, apologies, and reactions that you battle against — within yourself and 
from the general population — when you set out to raise funds, you will be 
better informed, have a deeper understanding of donors, and be more likely to 
be successful in your role.
In this section, we touch on what you need to do to spread your initial spark 
and passion about your cause to your potential donors. (Chapter 3, which 
deals with the ethics of fundraising, covers how you think about what you 
do.) We also introduce you to the nuts and bolts of the fundraising language 
so that you can talk the fundraising talk to the donors you’re trying to attract.
Remembering why you signed on
You may be involved with fundraising today, or you may be considering a 
request for involvement, but, either way, the initial spark that got you inter-
ested in your cause is what we’re talking about here. Like the Olympic flame, 
your spark gets carried from person to person and warms the very lifeblood of 
your organization, whether you’re a volunteer, staff member, or board member.

25
 Chapter 2: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
 
Knowing your spark story is important for several reasons:
 
✓ When you share it, it inspires others.
 
✓ When you remember it, it inspires you.
 
✓ When you recognize its importance, it helps you remember your 
priorities.
 
✓ When you keep it in mind, it provides a common ground where you can 
meet — and enlist help from — others whom you bring into your organi-
zation’s cause.
Helping your donor catch the spark
We talk in this chapter about the importance of knowing what brought you 
to nonprofit work in the first place. That initial spark shows in your eyes and 
your smile. It carries in your voice and makes your story ring true. It shows 
in the manner in which you promote your organization and in the personal 
pride you take in your relationship to your work and your cause. This sec-
tion presents a few key fundraising philosophies and tools that can help your 
donor catch the same spark that inspires you. For more specifics about work-
ing with donors, visit the chapters in Part II of this book.
 
The best thing you can do for your donors is believe in the mission you’re rep-
resenting. When you’re gung-ho for your cause, others see the importance of it 
and are encouraged to join. They start to imagine themselves working for a 
solid cause, a good effort, a positive change.
You’ve lost that loving feeling
If you feel that you’ve lost your initial spark or 
haven’t really analyzed what brings you to the 
cause you’re helping to promote, ask yourself 
the following questions and see whether that 
spark reignites (and if it doesn’t, you probably 
need to find a different cause to get involved 
with):
 ✓ When did I first become involved with this 
organization?
 ✓ What brought me here?
 ✓ What did I think was important about this 
cause?
 ✓ Why did I decide to help?
 ✓ What was going on in my life at the time 
that this cause appealed to me?
 ✓ What is my favorite success with this orga-
nization? A client’s happiness? A problem 
solved? A new connection made?
 ✓ What do I need in order to reconnect with 
my passion for this cause?
 ✓ How can I help others see what I see?

26
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
How many people volunteer?
Do you think volunteering is only for those 
few people who don’t have any other com-
mitments? Well, think again. According to 
Volunteering in America, a research brief pub-
lished in 2008 by the Corporation for National & 
Community Service, between September 2007 
and September 2008:
 ✓ More than 61 million adults (26.2 percent of 
the population 16 and over) volunteered.
 ✓ More women than men (29.4 percent versus 
23.2 percent) volunteered.
 ✓ Volunteers donated 8.1 billion hours of ser-
vice to nonprofit organizations.
 ✓ The average amount of volunteer time 
offered was 52 hours per year. Seniors 
(over age 65) offered the greatest amount of 
time at 96 hours per year.
 ✓ More than 43 percent of volunteers became 
involved with an organization after being 
asked to volunteer.
 ✓ Long-distance volunteering is a grow-
ing area of interest. More than 3.7 million 
adults traveled long distances to volun-
teer, often mixing vacations with volunteer 
opportunities.
Philanthropy as a right
Although philanthropy isn’t a new concept, U.S. 
residents get a perk when they give to worthy 
causes that residents of other countries don’t: 
The United States is the first country in the 
world to include a fundamental philosophy that 
encourages charitable giving. When you give, 
you get a tax break. This break isn’t some loop-
hole that someone figured out how to wriggle 
through — it’s intentional. Lawmakers highly 
regard the practice of philanthropy — it’s part 
of your heritage, part of your right — and, some 
say, part of your obligation.
One of the reasons philanthropy is so important 
in the United States has to do with the diversity 
of the country’s population and the foundational 
principles at the heart of the American ideal. 
Nonprofit organizations help lift and address 
needs that can go unrecognized and unmet in 
groups focused on the majority; through non-
profit organizations and the programs they 
develop, minorities can be heard and helped.
For example, John (one of your humble authors) 
was serving as a board chairman when the 
AIDS epidemic broke out, calling for a wave of 
response from leaders across the country and 
around the world. Many businesses and large 
nonprofit organizations were so concerned 
about the controversial nature of the cause 
that they failed to take action. But the Damien 
Center, a Catholic-based organization, took the 
need to heart and started an organization to 
provide basic life necessities free of charge to 
AIDS victims. This compassionate action broke 
through the barrier and enabled caring people 
to give and receive to lessen the suffering that 
AIDS causes. Within a year, the AIDS cause 
became a major philanthropic goal for organi-
zations who previously wouldn’t consider it.
Thus, you can see a major potential benefit phi-
lanthropy offers society at large: Philanthropy 
gives individuals and causes a voice, no matter 
where they fit on the spectrum of humanity.

27
 Chapter 2: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
Today’s philanthropy realizes that you can’t always see or touch the person 
who needs the help. Nonprofit organizations arose to help you help others, 
whether they live down the block or on the other side of the world. These 
organized bodies provide the channels for your help to get to families living 
in poverty in Jakarta, AIDS orphans in Africa, or families experiencing home-
lessness in your own town, which, in turn, enables you to do something con-
crete to help change the world for the better.
 
As a fundraiser, you’re the all-important link that helps a caring donor give to 
others. When you view what you do in this way, you recognize the importance 
of your role as a service provider. You also see how your initial spark can pass 
from one person to another. And suddenly, the conversation is no longer 
about simply raising funds.
Talking the fundraising talk
At first blush, fundraising may not seem like a fashionable profession that 
people oooh and aaah about at dinner parties (in fact, until people know you, 
they may avoid your gaze to avoid being asked for a contribution!). But when 
you come from a point of passion, your efforts take on the nobility of working 
for the greater good.
Like any industry, fundraising has its own language, and to spread your spark 
effectively, you need to understand and use the terminology naturally. You no 
doubt see and hear the following terms again and again as you raise money for 
the causes you believe in, so try to familiarize yourself with their meanings:
 
✓ Philanthropy: Actions and giving that attempt to improve the lot of people.
 
 In the fundraising field, one standard definition of philanthropy is “vol-
untary action for the public good,” meaning any action you take — with 
or without a financial component — to make life better for someone 
else. When you tithe at church, you’re taking part in philanthropy. When 
you drop coins in the container on the counter at the local convenience 
store, you’re being a philanthropist. When you include your local the-
ater or your alma mater in your will, you’re practicing philanthropy.
 
✓ Annual fund: A yearly fundraising effort.
 
 Most organizations run a yearly fundraising campaign in addition to any 
program-specific efforts. This annual fund is often earmarked for ongo-
ing operational expenses. See Chapter 18 for more about annual funds.
 
✓ Endowment: A substantial fund that generates ongoing income from its 
investment.
 
 An endowment is usually a large sum of money that’s invested. The 
appreciation from its investments and the interest the money generates 
help to support an organization. See Chapter 23 for more about how 
endowments work.

✓ Restricted funds: Funds designated by the donor to be used for a spe-
cific purpose; for example, for a particular program or fundraising drive.
 
✓ Nonrestricted funds: Funds that haven’t been designated by the donor 
for a particular purpose and can be applied as the nonprofit organiza-
tion sees fit.
Three nonprofits built from passion
Looking at examples of how passion has been at 
the core of fundraising efforts can be enlighten-
ing and inspiring. Here are just a few examples:
 ✓ When charity: water founder Scott Harrison 
signed up for volunteer service as a pho-
tojournalist with an organization called 
Mercy Ships, he had no idea what lay in 
store for him. Mercy Ships is a humanitar-
ian organization that brings — via floating 
hospitals — free medical care to some of 
the poorest nations in the world. During 
his service, Harrison met courageous and 
compassionate people whose lives were 
shaped by heartbreaking poverty, illness, 
violence, and more. Out of Harrison’s desire 
to be part of the effort to improve quality of 
life through simple service, charity: water 
was born. The organization works to raise 
awareness and provide clean, safe drinking 
water to developing nations. The charity: 
water Web site shares the statistic that one 
in six people in the world don’t have safe 
water to drink — a very basic life neces-
sity many people take for granted. You can 
find out more about charity: water at www.
charitywater.org.
 ✓ MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) 
was created when mom Candy Lightner lost 
her 13-year-old daughter Cari in an accident 
caused by a repeat-offender drunk driver. 
Though the organization benefited from a 
few large corporate gifts at its inception, it 
continues to be largely a grass-roots orga-
nization calling for heightened awareness 
and tougher punishments for alcohol- or 
drug-impaired drivers. MADD has more than 
400 affiliates worldwide because of Candy’s 
original passion, her perceived need for an 
organized effort to combat drunk driving, 
and the initial spark that spread to others. 
MADD illustrates perfectly what passion 
applied to a cause can do: Beyond simply 
growing in numbers, MADD grew in voice, 
becoming instrumental in changing the 
values and perspectives with which people 
view drinking and driving in today’s culture. 
You can visit the MADD Web site at www.
madd.org for more information.
 ✓ Habitat for Humanity grew out of a passion 
sparked in the mid-1960s when founders 
Millard and Linda Fuller visited Koinonia 
Farm, a small, cooperative farming com-
munity in Georgia. There they began dis-
cussions with farmer and scholar Clarence 
Jordan about the possibility of partnership 
housing, in which those in need of homes 
would work together with volunteers to build 
solid, affordable homes. Since Habitat’s 
founding in 1976, more than 200,000 homes 
have been built in more than 100 countries. 
Check out the Habitat Web site at www.
habitat.org for more information.
 
 Some years ago, John had the good for-
tune to meet Millard Fuller. Fuller shared 
his vision of how people become unified in 
a good cause. When the volunteers, who 
range from doctors to construction workers 
to healthcare professionals to stay-at-home 
parents, pick up the tools and drive the first 
nail, they’re joined together in work that 
helps build a life. Millard said his challenge 
was to get people to hammer that first nail.

 Chapter 2: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
Building on Passion in 
the Nonprofit World
The nonprofit organizations (NPOs) you care about were born from passion — 
a response to an identified need in the local, national, or international commu-
nity. The very frame of philanthropy rests on the idea that “when people work 
together, they are stronger” — when you share your resources, whether those 
resources are your wealth, time, effort, or ideas, others benefit. Basically, when 
people provide help, comfort, education, and more to people in need, society as 
a whole benefits. But putting together solutions is hard work — and passion and 
hard work are essential ingredients to carrying the idea from that initial spark of 
recognized need to the realization of a program that achieves its mission.
And of course, you’re not alone out there — your organization is competing 
for funding with many others. In this section we explain how that competition 
makes drawing on your passionate sense of mission even more important for 
the overall success of your organization.
Competing for dollars
 
Even though changing economic times bring adjustments in the giving world, 
fundraising totals haven’t dropped as much as you may think. Although Giving 
USA 2009: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2008 reported that the 
total number of fundraising dollars is down from 2007, this is only the second 
time on record that the annual amount of contribution has decreased from 
one year to the next. On a more hopeful note, organizations with religious and 
A mixed bag of contributions
Many nonprofits receive funds from a variety of 
contributors. An arts organization, for example, 
raises a percentage of its funds by selling tick-
ets for its exhibits, applies for grant monies from 
selected foundations, solicits charitable contri-
butions and in-kind gifts from corporations, and 
develops a planned giving program to help long-
time donors work out bequests that continue to 
fund the organization after the death of the donor. 
(See Chapter 21 for more on planned giving.)
In some agencies, especially those involved in 
health and human services, government funding 
is also part of the package. Other nonprofits sell 
a product and thereby are responsible for some 
taxable income in addition to their charitable 
contributions.
Whatever the funding patterns for your orga-
nization may be, get to know your income 
sources. Evaluate them, assess them, and 
know where your strengths and challenges lie. 
Strengthening this part of your program can 
help you discover major funding possibilities 
that you may be missing now.

30
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
international missions actually witnessed an increase in their donations in 2008, 
in spite of the challenging times. So if billions of people are still giving even in an 
uncertain economy, doesn’t it follow that many people are also receiving?
Whether your organization’s numbers were up or down last year, you still 
may be wondering about your competition. How many people are doing what 
you do — raising funds for various NPOs? How many of these organizations 
exist today, and how does that compare to a decade ago? In other words, 
what does your competition for fundraising dollars look like?
According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), the number 
of nonprofit organizations rose from 1,084,939 in 1996 to 1,478,194 in 2006. 
That’s a 36.2 percent increase in only ten years! Today it’s easy to under-
stand why many organizations are feeling a greater demand for their services 
with a seemingly ever-decreasing pool of available resources. Missions over-
lap. Different organizations seek to serve the same populations. Donors are 
pulled in different directions, recognizing that their dollars may be coveted 
by a number of similar organizations addressing similar needs.
 
The sad fact is that a nonprofit mortality rate does exist. Each year, nonprof-
its fold up their 501(c)(3) umbrellas and disappear. The level of competition 
for today’s fundraising dollars means survival of the fittest. To survive, you 
need to stay on your toes and be ready for anything. Sometimes you may 
even ask yourself, “Is this service worthwhile? Are there other organizations 
repeating our services?”
Keeping your organization going
What does this competition mean to you? For starters, if you want to keep 
your organization active and growing, you need to
 
✓ Know your mission statement inside and out — and make sure it’s 
relevant. A crystal-clear “why are we here?” mission statement (also 
called a case statement) helps keep everyone focused on the organiza-
tion’s vision. See Chapter 4 to learn about crafting a case statement that 
speaks to today’s need and touches people’s hearts.
 
✓ Be different. Know what you offer that is unique to your organization. 
Be active in local fundraising groups — know who else serves the popu-
lation you serve. When possible, work with, as opposed to against, other 
agencies so that you can complement and not duplicate each other.
 
✓ Know what’s out there. Make it a part of your regular research to know 
who is funding similar organizations, where leaders in the nonprofit world 
are migrating, which topics are in the public mainstream right now, and 
how your mission connects with what’s happening in the world.

31
 Chapter 2: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
 
 Stay engaged through social media, e-mail, discussion boards, and every 
opportunity for a good conversation (see Part III for more on using these 
resources). You never know where or when great connections will arise. 
The Chronicle on Philanthropy is one publication that should be in any 
fundraiser’s toolkit. Check it out at http://philanthropy.com/.
 
✓ Be responsive to the people you serve. The ever-changing world pres-
ents you with opportunities for refocusing and retooling at every turn. 
If the social ill you battle is no longer viable, step back and reconsider 
your clients’ needs and your organization’s options.
 
✓ Consider partnerships and new initiatives. Today traditional nonprofits 
with a long history and good backing are expanding their missions in 
ways you may not think of — sometimes partnering with other groups 
and sometimes adding on to or revising their missions. For example, 
Goodwill Industries was originally designed to help physically and 
emotionally challenged adults learn job skills and contribute to society 
through meaningful work. Their successful program grew and, in the 
process, the organization discovered that there was a market for the 
“gently used items” they offer. Today Goodwill Industries is a nationwide 
organization, and all their activities spring from the heart of their mis-
sion. When you’re considering next steps, remember that keeping the 
doors open or shut aren’t your only two options. Through creative part-
nerships and mission extensions, you may be able to add new energy — 
and attract new donors — in the midst of a challenging time.
 
✓ Ask the tough questions. Does your organization meet today’s needs? 
For instance, 50 years ago, an agency created to provide lodging to 
unmarried pregnant women was much needed. Today programs exist 
in many places to help young single mothers, and single pregnancy no 
longer carries the same social stigma it once did. An organization that 
asks itself the hard questions, such as whether what it’s doing is really 
necessary, and then changes based on the answers won’t be left in the 
dust when the world around it continues to grow.
 
✓ Be willing to change. Yep. You read it right. After you answer those tough 
questions about your organization, you have to be willing to make neces-
sary changes. Especially in large organizations with vested power struc-
tures and bureaucratic bends, change is often resisted at the board table. 
But populations, needs, and services change, so you need to be willing to 
change with them. Doing so can help protect your agency’s existence.
 
✓ Set deadlines. Especially when tough decisions are in the air, people 
may prefer to talk and talk — and talk — about what to do but never 
really get anywhere. You can set a deadline to help establish the expec-
tation that all this discussion will lead to action at a specific time. A 
deadline helps bring you to a conclusion and positions you to take the 
next step, which may be just what your organization needs.

32
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
✓ Put your best foot forward. People generally dislike crisis appeals — 
if you’re always crying “Wolf!” to bring in funding from various donors, 
sooner or later people are going to tire of the continual pleas. Instead, 
if you can show your donors that you’re part of a winning organization, 
a force that works for good in the world, you may not only keep their 
interest but also inspire them to join you in your winning campaign. 
(See Chapter 8 for ways to show and tell your cause to donors.)
Demonstrating Your Connection 
with Social Media
Today a new kind of conversation is going on in the nonprofit world and 
around the globe. And it’s happening in real time, via short sentences, status 
updates, and tweets as people participate via computers, cellphones, PDAs, 
and voice. Social media — as these communication outlets are called — is 
quickly becoming a staple of everyday communication for people of all ages, 
providing organizations, funders, volunteers, staff, and clients a way to con-
nect easily and quickly all over the world.
Social media is a broad term that describes the various technologies used 
to connect people with like-minded people across the globe. Facebook is the 
star on the social media platform stage, with more than 200 million active 
users — half of whom log on every day. Other social networking sites include 
MySpace, LinkedIn (which has a more professional look and feel), and vari-
ous industry- and organization-specific social networking options that service 
providers can customize for your personal use. Although the younger gen-
erations adopted social media right off the bat, today social media is quickly 
becoming a staple for all ages. In fact, Nielsen reports the fastest growing 
Facebook demographic is users aged 35–49, and the number of users aged 
50–64 is growing at twice the rate of the 18-and-younger crowd.
Twitter is another new voice in the conversation, offering organizations and 
individuals a way to provide continuous updates to those who subscribe to 
their Twitter feeds. Participants trade small amounts of information as well 
as links to Web pages for more details.
 
What can your organization do with social networking technologies to share 
your passion and build your fan base? Here are just a few ideas (for more 
detailed ideas and techniques, see Chapter 14):
 
✓ Create a Facebook page to post photos, events, announcements, and 
more to grow your online constituency in hopes of gaining more volun-
teers and potential donors.
 
✓ Use YouTube to share video clips, public service announcements, pro-
gram pieces, and more with a large, public audience.

33
 Chapter 2: Identifying the Fruits of Your Fundraising Passion
 
✓ Use Twitter to keep in quick contact and share updates with donors, 
staff, board members, and the public.
 
✓ Add a blog to your organization’s Web site to talk about issues your 
organization cares about. For example, an education organization can 
post links to stories about academic leadership, budget cuts, new educa-
tion programs, or other opportunities donors care about.
 
No matter which social media tool you use, the underlying message is all 
about connection. Social media enables you to stay in touch with all the 
people who care about your mission. Like an ongoing conversation, you can 
use your social networking tools to share fun, interesting, or compelling sto-
ries with those who care. This connection helps others see the work you’re 
doing in the world, and, if your message is successful, they’ll care more about 
becoming a part of your effort.

Chapter 3
Finding the Right Perspective: 
Fundraising Issues and Ethics
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the great fundraising debate
▶ Getting familiar with the ethics of fundraising
▶ Replacing fundraising myths with realities
T
he happiest fundraisers love what they do. They believe in their causes, 
and an air of invincibility surrounds them. They may not be the biggest 
moneymakers on the block right now, but something inside them recognizes 
that one day they may be. They have the power of belief, the pride of profes-
sion, and the inner conviction that what they do makes a difference.
This chapter explores the issues that you may face when you first begin 
fundraising. Not only do you have to combat the understandable dread of 
asking someone for money (nobody we know is too fond of rejection), but 
you also have to battle against a kind of built-in stigma — deep in the unspo-
ken attitudes people in today’s society have about money — that comes with 
the territory. Here you find out how to face some of those demons head-on 
and recognize that, for the most part, they’re simply misguided impressions 
you may have about fundraising. Money isn’t the root of all evil; rather, the 
love of money — at the exclusion of all else — is the real problem. When you 
shine the light on the misconceptions you have, they disappear like the illu-
sions they are, and the positives of this profession can really shine.
Inspiring or Selling: The Fundraising 
Debate Continues
Part of the stigma of fundraising is a social issue. Even though many 
Puritanical values are fading in today’s world, most people are still shy when 
it comes to talking about religion and money (sex has become okay). Taboos 

36
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
keep the reins on too much familiarity, keeping you from asking “prying” 
questions about another person’s finances and barring you from being so 
bold as to glance at another person’s checkbook while you’re standing in the 
checkout line at the grocery store. The person who breaks past these reins 
for a living is, according to the unspoken perception, violating a kind of per-
sonal privacy everyone wants.
Another part of the stigma is simply a bad reputation. To illustrate this 
stigma in action, here’s a story:
Jimmy is a part-time used car salesman. He knows every trick in the book for 
getting you to buy that car. He overlooks the fact that the car has lemon writ-
ten all over it. He somehow blinks away the idea that he’s trying to sell you a 
two-seater and you’ve got a family of five. He nods understandingly when you 
tell him that you were barely able to pay your electric bill last month and cer-
tainly don’t need a little yellow sports car that will put you even further into 
debt. As you sign the purchase agreement, he smiles a big smile, assuring 
you that all your troubles will just blow away as you do 90 mph through the 
desert. His gold tooth gleams.
Jimmy isn’t a fundraiser. And he’s not an ethical car salesman, either. Jimmy 
is interested in one thing: getting your money. And, contrary to popular 
belief, that isn’t the goal at the front of a fundraiser’s mind. All the textbooks 
and professional organizations tell you that fundraising is a noble endeavor. 
People who have been in this business for the span of their careers affirm it: 
Organizations do good work, open doors, help, heal, feed, and house because 
of the dollars their fundraisers raise.
In business, you don’t blanch when you read books that exalt the sales-
person. A sale, after all, provides the lifeblood of a business. In sales, you 
may argue, you have an exchange of goods or services. In fundraising, on 
the other hand, you have an opportunity for people to walk the talk of their 
beliefs. In the following sections, we explain how to balance your responsibil-
ity of asking for money with the negative public perceptions you may encoun-
ter and show you how sales skills and ideals really do fit together.
Living with the stigma
If fundraising is such a noble profession, where does the fundraiser’s black 
eye come from? Unfortunately, for some people, the word fundraising means, 
“I’ll try anything to get your money.” This mentality taints the fundrais-
ing process for all fundraisers who then have to get past that stigma when 
approaching possible donors.

37
 Chapter 3: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics
For ethical fundraisers, doing whatever it takes to get money couldn’t be 
farther from the truth. Instead, as an ethical fundraiser, you offer potential 
donors not the sale of a product or a palpable “warm fuzzy,” but rather the 
opportunity to join a group of people working in an area you — and hopefully 
the donor — care about. You offer a chance to make a difference, an opportu-
nity to “start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can,” as the 
saying goes.
 
An ethical fundraiser doesn’t sell a lemon of an organization to a donor. So, to 
be an ethical fundraiser, you need to remember that
 
✓ The match needs to be right between the donor and the organization.
 
✓ The donor needs to have the ability to give (for example, if the electric 
bill was a problem last month, major philanthropic giving is out of the 
question this month).
 
✓ The value exchange that takes place has to be a good one for both par-
ties because it’s the beginning of a long-term relationship, not a hit-and-
run experience in which the fundraiser stuffs the check in his pocket 
and heads on down the road, grinning his gold-toothed smile.
What about political fundraising?
You may notice that in this chapter (and even 
in this book) we rarely mention the fundraising 
your favorite political candidate does to secure 
your vote and fund his or her trip to office. 
Everyone has seen the amazingly adept commu-
nications and fundraising techniques of modern 
political campaigns; new technologies — and 
the willingness to use them thoughtfully — 
bring opportunities for donors to choose the 
who, what, when, where, and how of their 
giving practices. Political fundraising is the 
unappreciated stepchild of the fundraising field. 
Because of widely publicized political fundrais-
ing abuses, people sometimes blame fundrais-
ing for corrupting or, at least, preoccupying the 
minds and intentions of candidates.
In fact, if political fundraising more openly 
applied the good practices and ethics used in 
charitable fundraising, the standards would 
improve, the money would be raised, and 
good people of varying income brackets would 
have the chance to get into office. The areas 
of political and nonprofit fundraising aren’t so 
different, after all: When you raise funds in the 
nonprofit world, you’re working for a cause you 
care about. When you raise funds for a political 
candidate, you believe in the person or the plat-
form. The skills you discover in nonprofit fund-
raising are directly transferable to the political 
arena — and may lead you to contribute to the 
public debate and, thus, to the political system.

38
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Combining sales and ideals
Parts of fundraising are similar to — and informed by — good salesmanship. 
For example, to be a good salesperson, you need to develop certain sales 
skills that enable you to connect with your potential customer and under-
stand his or her needs. Fundraising builds on those skills and adds the sense 
of contributing toward a bigger purpose. Take a look at Table 3-1 to see how 
some basic sales skills relate to key activities in fundraising.

Use tools of research to help you find the people who will care about your 
cause (find out more about these tools in Chapter 7). If you identify people 
who have a real interest in your cause, approaching them isn’t selling them 
something they don’t want; it’s providing a connection they crave.
 
Do some people work for organizations they don’t believe in? Sure. But if you’re 
reading this book and want to grow in your professional or volunteer ability to 
fundraise, we assume that you’re willing to make the investment of time and 
effort you need to master the art of fundraising. Even if you’re not crazy about 
what you do right now, you can benefit by acquiring the skills you need for the 
day when you’re working for a cause that really ignites your passion.
Understanding the Ethics of Fundraising
As a noble endeavor, fundraising has standards to help you determine the 
“right” ways to fundraise. If you’re new to the area of fundraising, perhaps 
involved for the first time through volunteer efforts, board membership, or 

39
 Chapter 3: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics
a new development job, you may be starting to soak up some of the major 
ideas present in the nonprofit sector, two of the most important ones being 
ethics and accountability.
Ethics is basically the study of what’s right and wrong and the development 
of a moral code you can live by. Everybody in every walk of life at some time 
or other has to measure what they do for a living with what they feel is right 
and wrong. Some organizations focus on the ethics of fundraising; in the fol-
lowing sections, we introduce you to a few of these groups and explain how 
their work can help you better understand the ethics of what you do as a 
fundraiser.
Finding ethical standards organizations
So who sets the ethical standards for fundraising, and how are they gov-
erned? A number of professional organizations have formed to help set the 
standards that guide ethics in fundraising. Table 3-2 offers a select group of 
organizations you can contact to find out about membership and meetings in 
your area.
Paid by commission: A hot ethical topic
One issue that professional fundraisers — 
those working in development for an organi-
zation and those serving as consultants — 
continually argue about is whether a grant 
proposal writer should be paid by commission. 
Industry ethics say no. In fact, the 501(c)(3) pro-
vision says “no part of the net earnings of which 
inures to the benefit of any private shareholder 
or individual.” In at least one interpretation, this 
phrase means that fundraisers’ income should 
not be directly tied to the funds they raise.
The argument for paying grant proposal writ-
ers a percentage comes from the situations in 
which a small organization needs a good grant 
writer to secure major funds to keep the doors 
open. (Other things should be in place here, but 
we’ll stick with the percentages discussion.) 
If a grant proposal writer is paid a percentage 
after the grant is made, the organization can 
defer payment until it secures the funds and the 
grant proposal writer is paid what he or she’s 
“worth.”
Although this argument continues and 
many consultants — especially for small 
organizations — do agree to work for percent-
ages, this position is considered unethical by 
professional fundraising organizations.

organizations they can choose to support, so 
what factors will influence them to donate to 
your organization? The ethics with which you 
operate are very important — perhaps even 
more so as donors think carefully about the 
charities they continue to support when eco-
nomic stresses are high. As your donors decide 
whose name to write on the “Payable To” line, 
your transparency also helps build trust.
In the United States, two organizations provide 
information to help donors explore the health of 
the organizations they’re considering support-
ing. Visit these sites yourself to get a feel for the 
type of information provided, and add links from 
your Web site to these sites as a donor service 
to those who visit you:
 ✓ Charity Navigator (www.charity
navigator.org) is an independent 
evaluator that reports on the financial 
health of America’s largest charities. Even 
if you don’t qualify as one of the big organi-
zations donors may be looking for, you can 
use the information on Charity Navigator 
to find out how large, successful organiza-
tions are running their agencies. (You can 
learn a lot from other organizations’ suc-
cess stories.)
 ✓ Guidestar (www.guidestar.org) gath-
ers extensive data on nonprofit organiza-
tions in a large, comprehensive database 
that donors can use to guide their gift deci-
sions. They can find information on mis-
sions, programs, goals, success stories, 
leadership, and more — all for free. Check 
your own listing on Guidestar regularly 
to see how your organization looks in the 
public eye.

Familiarizing yourself with 
the fundraiser’s credo
As you continue thinking about ethical and responsible approaches to fund-
raising, you may want to familiarize yourself with the following industry 
standards:
 
✓ “A Donor Bill of Rights”: Developed by a number of professional organi-
zations (including the AAFRC, AHP, CASE, and AFP), this document gives 
you an idea of the type of exchange valued in an ethical relationship 
between donor and organization. You’ll find the document at http://
tinyurl.com/yjgnlog. Notice how many of the items have to do with 
clear, honest communication between parties.
 
✓ “Model Standards of Practice for the Charitable Gift Planner”: 
Established by the National Committee on Planned Giving (NCPG), this 
document details the practices that ethical charitable gift planners 
should follow. Find a copy of this document on the NCPG Web site: 
www.ncpg.org.
What about ethics in cyberspace?
The reality of fundraising online brings with it 
new challenges in the ethical domain. Using 
social media, Web pages, blogs, and more to 
increase visibility with your constituents may 
be a good thing, but you may need to take extra 
pains to make sure you’re as transparent and 
forthcoming as possible. Individuals who over-
state results, create new personas, or other-
wise use the relative anonymity of the Web to 
veil real identities and intentions have no place 
in ethical fundraising. As an organization seek-
ing to serve the public good, you need to make 
ethical practices a must for your online con-
nections. Here are a few suggestions for how 
to do so:
 ✓ Be transparent about your mission, meth-
ods, funding, and allocations.
 ✓ Provide site visitors with the information 
they need about you, your organization, 
your staff, and your plans.
 ✓ Only use secure, vetted sites if you choose 
to fundraise online.
 ✓ Provide donors with regular status reports 
to demonstrate your commitment to 
accountability.
 ✓ Moderate any open forums or discussion 
boards available on your site.
 ✓ Respond quickly to any donor or poten-
tial constituent’s concern regarding your 
online practices.

Debunking Fundraising Myths
This section exposes four myths of fundraising that may be holding you back 
from top-dollar fundraising. Building on the ideas that fundraising is a noble 
profession and that your passion for the cause is guided by professional 
ethics, you need to get rid of some of the attitudes that may get in your way. 
The attitudes reflected in the following anecdotes aren’t unethical; rather, 
they’re close calls you have to make that depend on how you view what you 
do and how clearly you understand your priorities. Following each myth, we 
propose some ethical guidelines that can help you maneuver smoothly and 
ethically through each type of situation.
Myth 1: It’s all about the money
Some people say fundraisers care only about money, while others think fund-
raisers care about helping others. Which is true?
Making money is the whole point
You have a lunch appointment with Mrs. M. You’ve spoken on the phone with 
her twice in preparation for this face-to-face meeting, and both times Mrs. M. 
sounded pleasant but cautious. You review your notes from your donor files 
as you drive to her house. As you pull into the landscaped drive, you return 
the donor file to your briefcase — no need for her to see your resource mate-
rials as the two of you drive to the restaurant.
At the door, Mrs. M. smiles and extends her hand. You introduce yourself 
and then compliment her on the dress she’s wearing. She flashes you a wry 
gaze. Perhaps the dress comment was too much, you think. Oh come on, her 
glance tells you. We both know this is all about money. What can you do to 
show Mrs. M. otherwise?
Sharing concerns and a willingness to help is the main goal
Instead of being all about money — seeing the donor as a dollar amount — 
fundraising is really about the relationship you create with another person — 
a hand extended, saying, “Come join our cause.”
Not everyone shares your concerns about recycling, music, or the college of 
your choice. Some people care more about political activism, fighting cancer, 
finding homes for the marginalized, or getting runaway teens home. When 
you find someone who shares your heart and welcomes your cause, you have 

44
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
a potential ally. With some good communication from you and the right con-
ditions for the giver (including a link to your cause, interest in what you’re 
doing, and the ability and willingness to give), helping is a natural next step.
Find the right connection with Mrs. M. — one that benefits her as well as 
your cause — and you can easily demonstrate that this relationship is about 
much more than money.
Myth 2: You lie to get what you want
Sometimes you may be tempted to exaggerate to try to get to your goal. In 
fundraising, insincere tactics don’t get you far in the long run. Is a short-term 
leap in honesty worth a long-term donor relationship? See what you think as 
you read this anecdote.
A white lie for a good cause is okay
You’re with a board member at her house, sitting in on a personal call with 
a major donor. The conversation isn’t going as well as you had hoped. The 
potential donor is firing questions at you left and right about specific uses 
of his gift and about guarantees that it will be used the way he wants it to be 
used. The focus from the board was specific about where lead gifts would go, 
but this donor wants a personal guarantee from you that he will be able to 
determine how his money is used. You glance at the board member; she says 
nothing. You decide to fudge a little, hoping you can figure out what to do 
later. “Okay,” you say, finally. “If you’re willing to agree to this lead gift today, 
we’ll let you choose the designation.”
What will you say to the board member when you get back out to the car? 
How will you handle the situation when the donor realizes he can’t control 
the way his funds are applied?
Slick may sell, but authenticity wins the day
The truth is, fundraising is actually a long-term activity. A firm hold on your 
ethics and priorities, along with a clear statement from your board about 
what to accept and what to resist, helps you fight the temptation to give in 
when a gift you’ve been pursuing is right in front of you and is yours for the 
taking — if you just bend a little.
The right thing to do with Mr. Major Donor in the preceding situation is to be 
honest about what you can and can’t do; if you think the board would make 
an exception, offer to ask them and get back to the donor the next day.

45
 Chapter 3: Finding the Right Perspective: Fundraising Issues and Ethics
Myth 3: Your donor owes 
the world something
Do you go after donations with the attitude that people with money owe you 
something? Or do you try to build a mutually beneficial relationship where 
you and the donor help each other?
It’s about time the rich started giving to the poor
Elias Q. Smith has been the richest man in town since he inherited his fami-
ly’s fortune. He has a reputation for being miserly, and other fundraisers who 
have approached him have come back with their tails between their legs.
When you arrive at his office, his secretary informs you that Mr. Smith is tied 
up in meetings all afternoon and won’t be able to meet with you after all. You 
tell the secretary you’ll wait. She shakes her head and returns to her work. 
You sit there, stewing about Mr. Smith’s miserly ways. It’s about time he 
gives something back, you think. It’s not right to sit on all that money and do 
nothing with it.
What do you say when Mr. Smith opens the door after his current meeting 
adjourns? Does the look on your face show your feeling of entitlement? How 
much respect have you shown for Mr. Smith and his choices by not resched-
uling your appointment?
The best donations benefit both the giver and the organization
People give money for all kinds of reasons. Maybe they want to be part of 
your organization because of a good experience they once had with the same 
type of organization. Maybe your cause is good for their business. Maybe 
they want the recognition a named donation presents. Maybe they’re trying 
to prove something to their parents. It’s not your job to question motives.
It’s your job to give Mr. Smith the chance to find out what your organization 
does and respect his right to make his own choice about whether your organi-
zation matches his interests. If he doesn’t find a match, thank him for his time 
to protect any future relationship if he has a change of heart and move on.
Some donors are shy
Some people have problems with the idea that 
if they give to your organization, their name 
may be added to the engraved nameplate in 
the foyer. Some people aren’t comfortable with 
banquets and recognitions and fountains and 
programs named in their honor. These people 
make great anonymous donors.

46
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Myth 4: Wining and dining 
donors is all you do
Some folks think fundraisers spend too much time and money on lengthy 
lunches with major givers. The fact is that most fundraisers are accountable 
for the money they spend and how they spend it. Which side of the debate do 
you find yourself on?
Fundraisers schmooze for a living
You have a lunch scheduled every day this week. On your way to one of 
the lunches, you try not to think about the look on your executive direc-
tor’s face when you told her your lunch schedule. “I’m concerned about the 
amount of money we’re spending to make money,” she said. “I’d like to talk 
about this later.”
You shrug off the concern and have a pleasant lunch with the new donor, 
who’s actively involved in children’s issues and made a trip to Namibia last 
year to visit an orphanage. The waiter brings the check and you pick it up 
quickly. Your prospective donor glances at the credit card you pull from 
your wallet. “Is the organization paying for this?” she asks. “Oh, of course,” 
you respond. Her next question blindsides you. “Is that where my donation 
will go?”
Fundraisers are accountable for what they spend
Before a foundation makes a grant in your direction, it wants to see what 
you do with the money you have, what you’ve done in the past, and what 
you’re planning to do in the future. Likewise, before a donor even gets close 
to giving a major gift, she’s going to have her financial advisors and lawyers 
check you out and look closely at your financial statements, your tax filings, 
and the giving levels of your board members.
The donor in this situation has a legitimate concern. To address it, consider 
the extra expenses that draw from your fundraising dollars and be willing to 
explain the structure of your fundraising budget.
 
If you take a potential donor out for lunch and he offers to pay, let him. You 
want your prospective donors to know that every dollar is dear to your cause 
and that your donor’s generosity saves the organization money. In addition, 
buying your lunch sets a precedent for the donor’s giving pattern. Now that 
he’s already supported your organization, you just need to build the giving 
relationship from there.

Your Agency’s Reason to Be

▶ Sharing your case statement in print and electronic format

f you’re new to fundraising, chances are that you’re also new to the case 
statement. Your organization’s case statement is an all-important vision 
document that spells out the major aspects of your organization’s story, from 
your mission, to your program goals and objectives, to board members, staff, 
and key volunteer leaders. Think of your case statement as the fabric you use 
to create all your other messages — promotional pieces, letters to donors, 
grant proposals, and more.
You may not be — or have any intention of becoming — an attorney, but 
there’s something to be said for being able to make your case. And when 
the economy is pitching and swaying around you and you’re trying to stay 
afloat (or, in better financial times, trying to navigate the squalls of abun-
dance pouring your way), a well-developed, clear case statement is your map 
and guide. Your ability to describe the mission of your organization, your 
goals, your objectives, your programs, your staff, and your plans all in one 
cohesive, well-thought-out document (in other words, your case statement) 
will impress your donors. It’ll also impress the people working with you, as 
well as others in the fundraising community. And even more important than 
impressing your donors and partners, your case statement will help them 
understand why you exist, why you do what you do, and why they want to 
join you in doing it. This chapter shows you how to put together a top-notch 
case statement and what to do with it.

48
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Stating Your Case
Before you can write your case statement, you need to understand what your 
case is and how you use the case statement after you’ve written it. You also 
need to know how to get started (see the “A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing the 
Case Statement” section for details on how to write your statement). This sec-
tion lays the groundwork so you’re prepared to state your case effectively.
Understanding what the case statement 
is and how you use it
A case statement is a clear statement of the need your agency addresses, how 
you address it, what makes you unique, and how others can help. Done well, 
the case statement provides the basis for all your other published materi-
als, as well. The message you generate in the case statement speaks for itself 
through presentations, brochures, newsletters, annual reports, and more. 
The tone, flavor, style, and focus of this information, carried from one piece 
to the next, help build the overall identity for your organization. The fact that 
you don’t say one thing one way in this brochure and say it another way in 
that brochure isn’t lost on your potential donors. Consistency carries a mes-
sage: dependability, clarity, and honesty.
Another use of the case statement — especially a good-looking case 
statement — is the effect it leaves behind. You can’t be everywhere at 
once, and you can’t always be the one to represent your organization, so it 
helps to have a document that gives the potential donor the facts of your 
organization — in more detail than you can or would offer in a face-to-face 
meeting. In putting together a case statement, your board and staff have to 
come together to communicate with each other about the central vision of 
the organization, which brings everyone involved to the same page.
Getting started with your case statement
Unfamiliar with case statements? Don’t worry — here are some questions 
people often ask as they begin to draft case statements for the first time. 
These inquiries give you a quick glance of what goes into a case statement:
 
✓ How long should the case statement be? This is easy to answer: As long 
as it needs to be. Now, before you start groaning, check out the steps in 
the “A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing the Case Statement” section later 
in this chapter for a listing of the items you need to include in your case 
statement. How much you have to say for each item determines how 
long it has to be.

49
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
 
✓ How often should you write a case statement? Theoretically, you write 
a case statement one time from scratch — and then you update it as 
needed. Because you have sections for programs, budget, and more, 
some parts of your case may need revising every year. Other parts, such 
as the staffing section or the history section, need revisions less often, 
only as changes warrant them. (See the “Overhauling an Outdated Case 
Statement” section for more advice.)
 
✓ Who should write the case statement? Ideally, a person who has a 
clear sense of the vision of your organization — someone with spark — 
should write the case statement. But this type of writing can be difficult, 
and the drier the text, the less likely donors and evaluators are to make 
it all the way to the end. If you have someone on your board or your 
staff who is a talented, lively writer, solicit that person’s services; other-
wise, have the person most likely to get the job done write a draft of the 
statement and then have a committee of reviewers go through the draft 
and offer opinions, make suggestions, and add information as needed.
 
✓ Should you include pictures and charts in a case statement? Your 
board or leadership group should decide the way in which you publish 
your case, but, in general, it never hurts to look good. Don’t overwhelm 
your readers by providing too many charts, using too many or conflict-
ing fonts, or shouting at them with headlines that are too big. Simple 
and understated are best. But a few photos — especially of a program 
in progress, your new facility, or your cheerful staff — can help hold 
the reader’s interest and build a bit more recognition for your agency. 
(Check out the “Formatting your case” section for more pointers on 
making your document look good.)
 
✓ Should you make your case statement into a video? Today you can use 
video for all kinds of storytelling — and your case is no exception. You 
can show the spark you want to communicate to your viewers by linking 
images — emotional, hopeful, or heart-wrenching — with your cause in 
your donor’s mind. Telling your case visually can be helpful when you’re 
filling out corporate and foundation grant applications, as well as when 
you’re introducing your organization to potential donors in another 
state or country, or on another continent. You can post your video 
on your Web site so that it plays whenever somebody lands on your 
home page, or you can post your video case statement on YouTube or 
Facebook. (See the “From paper to online posts: Putting the case state-
ment to work” section for ideas about what to include in the video.)
 
✓ Should you make your case statement available in PDF format on the 
Web? Absolutely! The more information about your organization you 
provide, the better — for both your donors and your organization. One 
suggestion, however: Hold back any sensitive financial data from the 
general public eye. Provide a link so that any visitors who want to see 
your financial data can send you an e-mail request.

50
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Making the Case Compelling
The case statement does more than provide the basis for the message you 
use in your grant proposals, PR materials, and other documents. The case 
statement gives you the opportunity to think through all the aspects of your 
organization, from mission to governance to program delivery, and to make 
sure you connect all the dots along the way.
 
Times of economic challenge and change — whether the financial landscape 
seems to be improving or worsening — provide a great opportunity for you to 
revisit your case statement and assess whether it really speaks to the current 
needs of your community or constituents.
What makes a case compelling for one group may leave another cold, so know-
ing what your donors care about — and explaining clearly how your organi-
zation gives them the opportunity to help in that particular area — is key to 
writing a compelling case. This helps donors make the connection between the 
cost of the unmet need and their ability to make a difference. For example, an 
educational organization might include in their case statement something like, 
“Nearly 70 percent of prison inmates in the U.S. today can barely read or write. 
We can invest in children now, or pay a far greater price later.”
The following list offers suggestions for the types of information you can 
include in your case to demonstrate the need and set the context for your 
services:
 
✓ Animal welfare: Tell today’s story of issues that connect with what’s on 
your readers’ minds. Include national statistics — such as the number 
of dogs euthanized each year, the number of abandoned animals, or 
the number of kittens that would be born without your spay and neuter 
clinic. Share stories of specific animals and families whom your organi-
zation has helped, and be sure to include stories of care, advocacy, and 
passion when you introduce your staff and volunteer corps.
 
✓ Art organizations: Explain how the current economic climate is affect-
ing art organizations as a whole. Find recent statistics on the number 
of closings or program suspensions in your area of specialty. List how 
many other nonprofit art centers are closing; describe how the sympho-
nies of neighboring cities are faring; tell the stories of theaters under 
siege. Find out whether art programs are being cut in your local schools. 
Connect the local need for arts advocacy to the very real benefit your 
art organization brings to your community, and tell compelling stories 
to fan the fire of advocacy in the hearts of your readers.
 
✓ Education: It’s no secret that governments change how much money 
they spend on education in times of economic change. Everyone knows 
the vital importance of education, but people often think funding comes 
from elsewhere — which can lead your potential donors to ask, “Why 
should I give? You get money from the government.” To tell your story 

51
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
compellingly, you need to have both facts and figures — national statis-
tics about funding cutbacks, teacher layoffs, and program suspensions, 
as well as data that demonstrates the needs of the people you serve. 
Connect the facts with stories of the difference your organization has 
made in the lives of real people touched by the services you offer, and 
invite the readers to see how your organization is an important part of 
the broader education landscape.
 
✓ Environment: Today you can find all sorts of statistics on global warm-
ing, climate change, conservation measures, and domestic and inter-
national efforts to make positive changes for the environment. When 
you’re considering what story to tell in relation to your organization, 
choose your facts and figures carefully and be sure to begin and end 
with the facts. Because the environment is a relatively new focus in 
society’s conversation, you still find a wide range of opinion about 
what’s happening, what’s needed, and what the long-term effects may 
be. Know where your organization stands in terms of key issues and 
take the extra effort to make your stance clear for your potential donors. 
Understanding your story in the context of developing science helps 
your donors find their connections to your cause.
 
✓ Healthcare and social service: In times of economic downturn, the 
need for services in all human services organizations — from healthcare 
groups to advocacy of all kinds — goes up at the same time that funding 
decreases. Whatever your focus may be, know the national and inter-
national statistics in your area. Be able to share stories of real people 
impacted by the cause you address and show — with compassion and 
care — how your organization has helped families meet their challenges. 
Make sure your stories are current and real; help readers get to know 
and identify with the real people you’re asking them to help.
 
 If your organization mobilizes to respond to a crisis — for example, a 
shortage at your food pantry, the emptying of your supply of flu vaccines, 
or the impact of a devastating storm — tell those stories in your case 
statement. The crisis may be temporary, but the story will capture the 
reader’s imagination and demonstrate your ability to fulfill your mission.
 
✓ International organizations: People have been saying “It’s a small 
world” for years and years, but just recently — perhaps at least in part 
because of the advent of the Web — this mantra seems to have become 
true. Today people from all over the globe can get involved in advocat-
ing for people in countries they’ve never visited; they can feel drawn 
to make a difference for children in Africa; they can be inspired by art 
in Sweden; they can want to help support an ecovillage in the United 
Kingdom. If your organization has international appeal, include both big-
picture and person-to-person stories in your case statement. The inter-
national donor cares about initiatives in which people and organizations 
work together in peace to reach a common goal, so be able to share the 
vision and collaboration of your organization, while at the same time 
telling powerful stories of individual lives and communities that have 
been impacted for the better by what you do.

52
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
✓ Religious organizations: Faith is an ever-important — but often 
unseen — component in the lives of individuals, groups, and nations. 
Fundraising for a faith-based organization, beyond any national affilia-
tion or tithing program, is still a challenge for congregations of all types. 
Although your programs provide the channel for the good you accom-
plish in the world, be sure to tell the human story — who’s impacted 
by what you do, how many people you’ve helped, and what your com-
munity would look like if you weren’t present to meet the need you see. 
Connect these facts with the story of your faith, and tell how your spe-
cific response to the need is providing a much-needed ministry. Telling 
the story of how you meet the universal need to alleviate suffering and 
help others move forward from your own particular tradition can pro-
vide a compelling invitation for others to support you whether they’re 
part of your tradition or not.
 
When you’re brainstorming ways to tell your story in the case statement, 
invite others in your organization — from board members to staff to your 
favorite donors — to share their favorite stories about your organization. You 
may wind up with a few great stories to include, and, at the very least, you’ll 
have some great content for your Web page or PR materials.
A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing 
the Case Statement
Okay, it’s time to get started with the case. In this section, we assume that 
you’re the person responsible for writing the case statement — the first draft, 
anyway — and that your board, your focus group, and any staff members 
you’ve selected to help with the review process will then review your draft, 
making revisions and suggestions as they go. Of course, if your organization 
does everything by committee and you’re drafting the document as a team, 
take the steps we describe in this section, multiply them by the number of 
people on the team, and pad whatever schedule you set for your tasks (which 
varies depending on your goal and the size of your organization) to provide 
extra time for each additional team member.
In the following sections, we walk you through the process of writing a case 
statement, using the organization StreetReach, a young nonprofit that serves 
teenagers who are homeless, as an example.
Step 1: The mission: Why are you here?
The first step is to draft your mission statement. The best mission statements 
share the following characteristics:

53
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
 
✓ They’re clear, concise, and easy to understand. The shorter the better — 
fine-tune your mission message so you can deliver it in the time it takes 
the elevator to move from one floor to the next.
 
✓ They capture and hold the reader’s interest.
 
✓ They include a call to action that gives the reader a reason to respond now.
Your mission statement should draw readers in and hold their attention. 
Start out strong. Describe the issue you’re addressing; explain your solu-
tion; then specifically describe your organization and show how it uniquely 
addresses the problem you opened with. The process looks like this:
 
✓ Big picture (problem)
 
✓ Zooming in (solution)
 
✓ Close up (the specific ways in which your organization addresses the 
problem)
 
Write with passion, and your words will read with passion. For example, 
consider this introduction from a case statement: “The masterful chords of 
Rachmaninoff sounded through Sandinsky Hall, pounding powerfully from the 
fingers of 14-year-old piano prodigy Anna LaFuentes. . . .”
Getting a clear view of your mission
Perhaps even more important than what the outside world thinks of your 
organization is what your organization understands about itself. Drafting a 
careful case statement helps bring a wide range of thoughts into a focused 
purpose, which enables everyone connected with your organization — 
donors included — to get a better picture of what you do and what you need.
 
When people have different ideas about what the organization does, they may 
be pulled in different directions, which can mean wasted effort, money, time, 
or worse. When you define and stick to a clear, specific mission for your orga-
nization, you make sure everyone’s efforts are spent in pulling the organiza-
tion down the same path.
Thousands of nonprofit organizations are out there today — what’s special 
about what you do? If you can’t answer that question for yourself and your 
agency, you’re going to have a hard time convincing someone else to join 
forces with you and fight for your cause. As the competition for fundraising 
dollars becomes fiercer (which it has — and continues to do), the need to 
determine “What’s special about us?” grows ever greater.
Seeing how StreetReach defines and refines its mission
To get a better idea about the importance of defining your organization’s 
mission, imagine that you’re a part of the nonprofit organization StreetReach. 
As a fundraiser for the organization, you know that StreetReach’s mission 
is “to identify and reach out to disenfranchised teenagers in the Baltimore 

54
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
community, offering fun, educational, and safe activities that help them build 
better relationships with peers and parents.” But when potential donors and 
others ask your board members about the mission of your organization, here 
are some examples of how they respond:
“We’re here to serve the needs of youth.”
“We help teens in trouble.”
“We get kids off the street.”
Although none of the board members is dead wrong in the summary of your 
mission, none of them hit the nail on the head, either. They all have different 
ideas of what the agency is all about. To improve StreetReach’s fundraising 
efforts, the agency hires Jane as its first full-time development director (who’s 
in charge of fundraising for an organization) and asks her to draft a case 
statement. Consider how Jane handles each of the elements we describe in 
the preceding section in the StreetReach mission statement:
 
✓ Big picture: Homeless teens living under bridges, in abandoned tene-
ments, in boxes and doorways in every major city nationwide. Homeless 
teens often run away as young as 12 years old, learn the prostitution 
trade weeks later, and eat only every other day, surviving on the scraps 
left by those who have homes, families, and futures.
 
✓ Zooming in: You may want to think a city as progressive as Baltimore 
doesn’t have teenagers living on the streets. You may want to think the 
best about our city, but you’d be closing your eyes to a real problem 
facing our city today. Last year more than 350 teenagers lived under 
bridges, in abandoned buildings, and in the doorways of our community. 
They lived on the streets along with the shadows of drug addiction, hor-
rendous poverty, illness, depression, and the haunting nightmares of 
sexual abuse and exploitation.
 
✓ Close up: StreetReach is a 501(c)(3) organization that began with the 
simple mission of getting help for these kids — whether that help is con-
necting them with their families, giving them bus fare home, finding suf-
ficient counseling services, providing occupational training, or moving 
them into transitional housing. StreetReach reaches out and offers a hand 
and a heart to hurting teens, giving them a home, a chance, and the skills 
they need to create a life free from the horrors of homelessness.
The resulting mission statement that Jane draws up your organization looks 
something like this:
Homeless teens. Not a problem here? Better look again. Come join us and 
help us get these kids back home to their beds, their rooms, and their 
families. And for those kids who don’t have a home to go back to, you can 
provide a means for them to complete their education and pick up the 
tools they need to enter the workforce, which gives them a real chance to 
succeed in the adult world.

 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
Step 2: The goals: What do 
you want to accomplish?
After you’ve established the why of your organization — the mission — you 
need to think about the what. What are you trying to accomplish? Your orga-
nization’s response to the need you focused on in the mission statement 
makes up the goals section of the mission statement.
 
When writing about your goals, try to paint pictures in your reader’s mind. 
Images last longer than abstract figures, so, for example, describe the light in 
the eyes of the elderly patient, not just the medical supplies she receives.
Jane, the development director of the StreetReach organization (for which we 
compose the mission statement in the preceding section) came up with the 
following goals:
 
✓ To get teens off the street
 
✓ To help teens get home whenever possible
 
✓ To enable teens who can’t return home to become self-sufficient
 
Remember to think organizational goals here. For example, instead of describ-
ing the new programs you want to offer, focus on the larger challenges you 
seek to address through your organization, such as helping to preserve the 
natural waterways in your area, improving the reading skills of recovering 
addicts, or taking arts education into private schools by the year 2011.
Step 3: The objectives: How 
will you reach your goals?
Objectives give you a way to tell the people who read your case statement 
how you will accomplish the goals you define in the preceding section. While 
your goal may be to get homeless teens off the street, your objective may be 
to work with local agencies to find housing for 25 teens a year.
 
Make your objectives specific, measurable, and attainable.
The objectives Jane comes up with for StreetReach (the example organiza-
tion from the preceding sections) show specifically how the organization 
plans to work toward each of its goals. For example, the first goal is to get 
teens off the street, so the objectives are as follows:

56
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
✓ Research and report on the extent of the homelessness problem among 
teens by June 1, 2010.
 
✓ Develop a trained volunteer group of 30 adults to begin outreach ser-
vices by September 1, 2010.
 
✓ Provide, as of September 1, 2010, transitional housing, food, and cloth-
ing to ten teens coming in off the street.
 
Here are some questions you should be able to answer “yes” to as you write 
your objectives:
 
✓ Are your objectives brief?
 
✓ Are your objectives measurable?
 
✓ Did you set a date by which the objectives will be achieved?
 
✓ Do the objectives answer the question “How will we meet this particular 
goal?”
 
✓ Have you included specific program information?
If your organization is using an existing case statement, find out when the 
objectives were last updated. Because objectives are measurable and tied 
to programmatic responses to your organization’s goals, they will — and 
should — be revised every year.
Similar but not the same
When you first begin working with the mission 
statement, goals, and objectives, the different 
areas may seem to mesh together in your mind. 
Don’t panic — that’s normal. Each of these 
areas has an important, albeit subtle, difference 
that distinguishes it from the others:
 ✓ The mission statement explains the need 
that your organization addresses.
 ✓ The goals are general ways in which your 
organization seeks to respond to that need.
 ✓ The objectives list the specific, measurable 
ways your organization will meet its goals.
And although not a defined section in your case 
statement, your organization’s accountability 
needs to come through loud and clear through-
out the entire document, including these first 
three sections. Your donors and other major 
stakeholders will get a sense of your account-
ability, especially in the sections about the 
leadership of your organization, evidence 
of financial responsibility, and long-range 
planning.
Although your organization has only one mis-
sion statement and a few goals, you may have 
several objectives for each of your goals.

57
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
Step 4: Programs: What 
exactly do you provide?
In the programs section of your case statement, you get to pull out the stops a 
bit and toot the horn of your organization. What are your most effective pro-
grams? What are you most proud of? This section enables you to talk about 
what your organization does and how it helps the people it serves.
 
Use “alive” language. The verbs you choose carry the movement of the images. 
Flash strong words wherever possible, for example, “The Clean Needles pro-
gram brings healing to an ailing neighborhood in downtown Detroit. . . .”
In Jane’s case statement for StreetReach, she writes about the TLC program 
that StreetReach currently offers, taking medical supplies and basic food and 
clothing items to kids living on the street. The major parts of this program, 
which include creating links to area agencies, reuniting teens with families, 
and providing residential training for kids who can’t return home, are all proj-
ects StreetReach plans to launch this year to further its mission.
 
Be sure to include a paragraph about each of the programs your organization 
offers. Then when you need to use selected paragraphs in a grant proposal, 
for example, you can simply remove the paragraphs that don’t apply and leave 
those that do (we discuss grant proposals in Chapter 11). Thus, you have a 
minimum of effort and an economy of work. The case statement helps you say 
what you need once — powerfully and succinctly.
Step 5: Governance: What’s 
the anatomy of your board?
Not all prospective donors are board-savvy, but you can be sure that any 
donor considering giving you a large gift or any foundation reviewing your 
grant proposal will want to know how your organization is governed. Who 
comprises your board? What different areas and interests do they represent? 
You answer these questions in the governance section of your case statement.
Be sure to include the following elements in your governance section:
 
✓ The legal status of your organization (501(c)(3) status if you have it)
 
✓ An overall picture of your board, including the number of members, 
member selection process, terms of service, and committee structure
 
✓ Specific information about key people on your board
 
✓ Information about the administrator, or executive director, of your 
organization

58
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
In the governance section, Jane lists the executive director and all board 
members, their board titles, and their current professional affiliations. She 
also lists key volunteer leaders who have been part of special events and 
fundraising campaigns or who have served in an advisory capacity.
Step 6: Staff: Who are the people 
behind your services?
The next important step is to include information on who actually provides 
the services to the people you serve — in other words, your staff. In the staff 
section of the case statement, you need to include both general information 
about how your staffing system is set up and specific information on the 
duties of key roles. You may want to include summarized job descriptions to 
give readers an idea of which tasks go with which roles.
In addition to describing the different hats your staff members wear, you 
need to talk about the staff members themselves. We suggest that you stick 
to the key staff members in your organization — people in roles unlikely to 
change often, such as the executive director, the director of development, 
and so on. Also introduce key volunteers and people who have been ready, 
willing, and able to take on leadership roles for your organization’s cause.
In the staff section of StreetReach’s case statement, Jane includes brief bios 
of each of the key staff members, including the program directors and staff 
members directly involved in program delivery. This section shows the range 
of talent and experience staff members bring to the organization.
You may want to request copies of your staff members’ resumes as you 
create your case statement so that you have them when you need them later. 
After all, staff will be an important part of all the grant proposals you submit, 
too, and you want to attach the resumes of key people in your programs 
along with your grant proposals.
 
If you’re a startup nonprofit organization, you may not have staff yet. That’s 
okay. In your staff section, mention that you’re a startup organization, 
describe any current staffing conditions, and mention where you envision 
your staffing to be a year from now.
Step 7: Location: Where 
do you live and work?
The location section of your case statement describes where you provide 
the services you offer. You may have a traditional office in a traditional part 
of town, or you may be an Internet-based 501(c)(3) that does its work in the 

59
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
home offices and computers of various board and staff members. Or you may 
even work out of a museum or out of a delivery van.
Wherever your location is, describe it. Explain how the location is right for 
the services you provide and how many people you can serve there. Show 
how it helps you meet your goals. Include any plans for improvement and/
or enhancement you have for the facility (and be sure to illustrate how these 
improvements will help you better meet your service goals).
The location section in the StreetReach case statement details the physical 
location of the StreetReach main office, as well as three small satellite offices 
that are hosted on local college campuses and run by volunteers.
Step 8: Finances: Is your organization 
financially responsible?
Although the finance section certainly includes your current financial state-
ments, one of the most important things a donor looks for is an explanation — 
a summary — of your financial picture. As part of this summary, you want to 
include information about your current income and expenses, the overall finan-
cial picture today, and your projections for tomorrow.
 
Most importantly, make sure you write your finance section in understandable 
terms. Not everybody is an accountant, but everybody knows that 1 + 1 = 2.
Talking about money is a tough thing to do, and writing about it can be even 
harder. If you keep in mind that you’re still telling your organization’s story — 
explaining the need, but this time with numbers — you can move beyond 
financial phobias and get the important information down on paper. In general, 
remember to do the following in the finance section of your case statement:
 
✓ Fight the desire to detail to death. Especially when talking about 
money, people tend to show specifics to the nth degree. It’s more impor-
tant in this financial narrative to give the reader a big picture of your 
finances. The financial statements you provide can fill in the details for 
those readers who want them.
 
✓ Focus on people, not numbers. Numbers and people aren’t mutually 
exclusive — talk about your numbers in the context of the people they 
help. For example, Jane of StreetReach uses a statement like, “We were 
able to help 102 teenagers return home or find suitable housing, at an 
average cost of $65 per child,” in her case statement’s finance section.
 
✓ Show and tell. Charts are helpful in giving readers a quick impression of 
your overall financial picture. Create charts that are easy to understand, 
and be sure to title and label them in such a way that readers can get the 
message quickly.

60
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
✓ Evaluate and revise. Your board will be reviewing your entire case 
statement, of course, but you may want to have your financial advisor 
review the finance section before the initial review. Having a profes-
sional take a peek at the numeric data can help you catch any errors or 
inconsistencies early.
Step 9: Development: What 
will you do in the future?
Anyone thinking of contributing to your cause wants to know that you’ll be 
around tomorrow. If they donate $1,000 to your symphony today, they want to 
know that they’ll be able to come hear Mozart in the summer series. The devel-
opment section of your case statement is where you show your prospective 
donor that you’ll be here tomorrow, and you do so by explaining the following:
 
✓ That your organization has a vision for the future
 
✓ That you have a specific plan for carrying out that vision
 
✓ That you have checks and balances in place to ensure accountability
 
✓ That you have credible people monitoring programs, finances, and growth
 
✓ That you have the means for evaluating your own progress and revising 
goals as needed
Getting input from your stakeholders
A stakeholder is someone who has an interest 
in your organization — whether that person is 
a donor, a volunteer, a staff member, or a board 
member. When you begin to discuss case 
statements, testing the primary ideas — such 
as your mission statement — with a sampling 
of your stakeholders is a good idea. Be sure to 
have clients represented as well as the people 
who serve them. One arts organization that was 
created to support a local symphony forgot to 
count the musicians among the stakeholders 
from whom they invited input. Oops. Be sure 
that when you ask for opinions and suggestions, 
you ask a wide range of people who care about 
what you do — not just the people responsible 
for securing the funding for it.
One way to find out what your stakeholders 
think is to create a focus group. In essence, a 
focus group is any group of people you bring 
together to focus on a particular task, docu-
ment, program, or problem. Although focus 
groups can help you get a feel for issues you 
need to address in more depth, don’t mistake 
them for a representative sampling of public 
opinion. If four out of six people in your focus 
group think that your idea is a great one, for 
example, you can’t take that to mean that the 
same percentage of the general public will feel 
the same way. Test your ideas, throw them out 
in a focus group, and listen carefully to the ideas 
and suggestions offered. Then use the prelimi-
nary information you’ve gathered to target and 
launch a more in-depth investigation, if needed.

61
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
For the development section of the StreetReach case statement, Jane 
includes a new program currently in the planning stage, as well as a write-up 
of an expanded Web effort and plans for a new special event.
 
This section requires big-time board input. If you’re the lone development 
person or a volunteer putting together a case statement for the first time, you 
may not be able to address these issues for your particular agency. Not all 
organizations have a system of self-evaluation, although everyone seems to 
agree it’s a much-needed facet of nonprofit management. If you’re in the dark 
about the details of your organization’s development plan, request a meeting 
with your executive director and/or board chairperson. Asking and answer-
ing questions about the way your programs get evaluated may just start 
a domino effect that causes your board to think about these development 
issues seriously for the first time.
Step 10: History: What successes 
are you building on?
Many charitable organizations — especially the ones that have been around 
for a long time — want to tell you all about their histories. They can keep you 
rooted in your seat for hours, describing great people, events, and influences 
that came about because of their existence in your community. They’re glad 
to show you photos of past volunteers and produce a timeline of significant 
achievements.
The only thing wrong with this approach is that it puts your donors to sleep. 
Today’s donors want to know the highlights that show you have momentum 
and accomplishments to build on, but their focus is all about today’s issues. 
History is all well and good and is important as a means for gauging how your 
organization has lived up to its promises in the past, but people giving money 
today want to know where the money will go today. They want to join with you 
in solving a need today. They’re interested in doing something today that will 
help make things better for tomorrow. For this reason, the history section comes 
at the end of the case statement; however, don’t let its position in the case 
statement fool you into thinking that your organization’s history is unimportant.
 
History gives your organization a power that new organizations don’t have — 
a reconnecting energy that summons the best of the past with the hope for 
tomorrow. Your past successes are essential in convincing donors that their 
money will actually accomplish something. The people involved with your 
organization catch the spark first ignited by your agency’s founders when they 
relive the history of the need, the mission, and the people. But the viability of 
your current request doesn’t lie in your organization’s past. You’re raising 
money today because there’s a need for what you do — today. Speak to that 
need. Put real faces on the need, describing people whose lives improve 
because of your mission.

62
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
The history section of the StreetReach case statement includes the story of 
the organization’s beginning — the compassionate wish of an individual to do 
something for teenagers in trouble. Jane writes a compelling section sharing 
how the organization has grown thanks to a dedicated and passionate volun-
teer corps.
Overhauling an Outdated Case Statement
Maybe you already have a case statement, but you’re looking for ways to 
breathe new life into the old document and hopefully attract more funding at 
the same time. Put on your reviewer’s hat (you may want to invite input from 
colleagues as well) and consider the following questions:
 
✓ Is the need you address in your case statement compelling? Does it con-
nect with today’s real need?
 
✓ Are your programs described fully, with measureable outcomes?
 
✓ Do your objectives seem realistic?
 
✓ Does the description of your board sound like it has a lot of energy, as 
though your organization is ready for growth?
 
✓ Is your staff section current, spotlighting talents and abilities that meet 
today’s need?
 
✓ Is your financial section up-to-date and written in understandable terms? 
Have you demonstrated support from major donors and foundations?
 
✓ Does your history section connect with today’s lively story of your 
organization?
If you hesitate in answering any of these questions, consider doing an over-
haul of your case statement. Bring in fresh new stories. Include new devel-
opments in technology. (Do you use Twitter? Are you blogging now?) Add 
phrases or stories that show that your organization really does address a 
real need in your community today. An hour or two spent reworking an old 
case statement can go a long way toward helping your donors recognize why 
they want to support your efforts.
 
Always keep a master copy of your case statement updated with changes, 
revisions, and ideas that others suggest. You may find that as the years go by, 
some ideas work better than others, some programs are explained better than 
others, and some foundations request more information in certain areas 
because your case isn’t quite detailed enough on some points. You can make 
those adjustments over time, improving the case as you go along. Your case 
statement, like your organization, is an evolving, growing entity. Remember to 
keep it up-to-date as your agency evolves.

63
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Case Statement: Your Agency’s Reason to Be
Sharing Your Case Statement
After your board reviews the case statement and you make any last-minute 
changes, you’re ready to begin sharing it with the world. How you go about 
sharing your case depends on who your potential donors are. Today’s 
donors are more technologically savvy than donors in years past — so they 
may prefer to receive your case statement electronically, either by e-mail or 
simply via a link to a file you’ve posted online in document, video, or presen-
tation format. Of course, your older donors may not be too keen on all the 
newfangled Internet stuff, so being prepared to provide good, old-fashioned 
print versions of the case statement is important, too.
Formatting your case
Whether you decide to offer the case as a print or electronic document, you 
need to put some time and effort into making the format of the document as 
pleasing as possible. A well-formatted document is easy to read and helps the 
reader understand the main points quickly (through the use of headings and 
bullet points). Here are a few suggestions for formatting the case statement:
 
✓ Use a readable font. Remember that the people reading your case may 
be young, old, or anywhere in between, so don’t make the typeface (or 
font) too small. Generally setting your word processor to 12-point Times 
New Roman is a good choice.
 
✓ Make your headlines stand out — but not too far out. You need to 
have headings for each of the major categories, and you need to choose 
a type size and style that lets readers know you’re changing tracks. A 
larger font, like Arial 16 bold, accomplishes this task. Consider using 
built-in styles for consistency.
 
✓ Avoid using too many fonts. The flexibility of word processing gives 
you so many different fonts and formatting choices to play with that you 
can drive yourself — and your readers — batty by using too many bells 
and whistles in a single document.
 
✓ Include charts if necessary. Charts are a great way to show complex 
information at a glance, but don’t include them if you don’t need them. 
Including visual effects gratuitously may seem like a good idea in the 
name of holding people’s attention, but unneeded information in a case 
statement is just a waste of space.

64

From paper to online posts: Putting 
the case statement to work
As organizations become more comfortable with the variety of communica-
tion methods available — from traditional reports and brochures to online 
videos and tweets — they get more and more creative about the ways they 
tell their stories and provide information to donors.
After you have the case statement in its final form, you can reuse what you’ve 
created in several different ways. Reusing your case statement’s content 
is not only a smart use of your time but also helps build the credibility of 
your organization because all your messages are consistent. You can use 
the information you created in your case statement in virtually everything 
you produce for your organization, including brochures, newsletters, grant 
proposals, campaign plans, appeal letters, speeches, press releases, public 
service announcements, videos, and your Web site’s content.
After you have a finished case statement, you can use the full document in 
the following ways:
 
✓ Save an electronic version of the document as a PDF (Portable 
Document Format) file and post a link to it on your Web site. A PDF file 
preserves the format of the document and enables readers to print it no 
matter what kind of computer they’re using.
 
✓ Use the text as a basis for slides and bullet points in a PowerPoint pre-
sentation you can give to donors or make available on your Web site.
 
✓ Print copies of the case statement and include them in informational 
folders you take with you when visiting potential donors or foundations.
You can also use specific sections of your case statement to create fun and 
effective identity pieces. For example,
 
✓ Use the text from the governance section to do a five-minute video intro-
ducing your board members to the general public.
 
✓ Use the basics from your program section to tell the story of your pro-
grams by filming a day in the life of one of the families who receives 
your services. In addition to posting the edited video (on your Web site, 
YouTube, or any number of other video-posting sites), you can include a 
link that users can click to download a copy of PR materials (which you 
can also create using the information from your case statement).
See how easy it is to put your case statement to work for your organization? 
Oh — and did we mention how efficient it is? Create your case once, and use 
it many times.

Organizing Your Team: Board 
Members and Volunteers
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know your board and its main functions
▶ Convincing the board to advance your cause
▶ Helping your board make tough decisions
▶ Understanding the true value of volunteers
I
n this chapter, we show you how to work with two of your most valuable 
assets: your board and your volunteers. Your board helps you set your 
goals and strategies — and having a good one is truly a magic key to getting 
things done. Your board can provide tremendous support for your fundraising 
efforts along with setting the course for the big picture of your organization. 
Equally important to your organization’s effectiveness are your volunteers. 
Some volunteers lick stamps, go door-to-door gaining support for your cause, 
and process donations, while others provide leadership in a variety of ways. 
These two groups of people — your board and your volunteers — provide the 
answers to the why and how of fundraising and contribute in a big way to the 
overall success or failure of any initiative you undertake.
Board members and volunteers are crucial to your organization in any time 
in its history, but they’re even more important during times of change. Your 
board members are often the ones closest to your efforts — they’re the keep-
ers of the legacy and the eyes to the future; their experience, wisdom, and 
relationships help you navigate through both the good and the bad changes 
that come your way. Volunteers are the people who invest their time in your 
organization because it means something to them — their dependability, 
resourcefulness, and generous effort help sustain your mission and make a 
positive impact on the people you serve. This chapter explores ways to gather 
these great people around you to help bring in the support — practical, emo-
tional, and financial — you need to be a successful, effective organization.

Seeing the Big Picture: How Boards 
and Fundraising Fit Together
The board is a very important part of your organization, so you have to 
understand who your board members are and what they can do for you. 
Having high-profile members who are also good fundraisers is a dream come 
true, but chances are your board includes a mix of experiences, personality 
styles, and comfort levels. You may have a fair amount of educating to do 
before the board feels comfortable — and can be effective — in fundraising. 
The following sections explain how a board oversees and directs a nonprofit 
organization and how your role as a fundraiser fits with the board’s mission.
Understanding the board’s duties
Being a board member isn’t all about prestige and power. It involves vision, 
dedication, hard work, and all the responsibility a person is willing and able 
to handle. Some of the most important duties of a board include recruiting 
and hiring the CEO; approving the mission statement, the budget, and the 
fundraising plan; developing the policies that make the staff accountable to 
the organization; and setting the ethical and moral framework for the organi-
zation. You can divide the various responsibilities of the board into the fol-
lowing three major areas:
 
✓ Organization governance: The board of directors for your organization 
has the responsibility of governing the agency, in terms of both dealing 
with legal issues and answering the question, “Are we being true to our 
mission?” Board members are in charge of holding the organization’s 
assets — financial and material — in trust for the stakeholders.
 
✓ Community interaction: Your board members are your organization to 
the community; they represent who and what your organization is. The 
choices the board makes — on behalf of the organization or not — 
reflect on you and your mission. As a group, they’re responsible for 
evaluating and leading the public persona of your organization, which is 
extremely important when it comes to fundraising.
 
✓ Growth and vision: Your board not only ensures that the organization 
is accountable to everyone it serves today but also looks ahead into the 
future and charts the short- and long-term growth. The board’s invest-
ment in the future means caring about the mission and programs as well 
as training its members for fundraising, raising the funds needed for day-
to-day programming and long-term sustainability, and finding and hiring 
key people in your organization.

67
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
Knowing how your role fits 
with the board’s work
As a development person, you may wonder what your role with the board 
should be. If you’re the development director or executive director, the 
board may have hired you. If you’re a volunteer, you may have grown 
through the ranks into a position of volunteer leadership, which means you 
have some involvement with your board.
As someone in a key fundraising position, here’s what you need to do in rela-
tion to the board:
 
✓ Share the fundraising. You are not — nor should you be — the Lone 
Fundraiser for your organization. The board is responsible for overseeing 
the mission, development, implementation, and evaluation of the work 
that your organization carries out. Each person involved in the leadership 
of the organization — including board members — has to be willing to get 
involved in securing the funds necessary to fulfill the mission. If fundrais-
ing isn’t part of your board members’ job descriptions, you need to add it.
 
✓ Identify prospective board members. Even if your role doesn’t include 
recruiting board members (some organizations recruit on a peer-to-peer 
basis), your role is key in identifying people who would add experience 
and assets to your board.
 
✓ Keep the spark alive. Part of your role as a development person is to 
help your board recatch the spark when they’ve lost it (see Chapter 2 to 
read about the spark); you can do so by providing information, running 
retreats, or suggesting new roles and committee structures.
 
✓ Train and educate new members. As a member of the development team, 
you’re in charge of training new board members and educating them 
about fundraising opportunities, keeping them abreast of new ideas and 
avenues, and apprising the board of needs, changes, and the status of cur-
rent campaigns.
Who’s on your board?
Depending on the size and involvement of your 
board, you may have several different types of 
board members, including the following:
 ✓ Advisory members: Members who serve to 
advise the board in specific areas related to 
the organization’s mission
 ✓ Executive or trustee members: Members 
who are the voting members of the board
 ✓ Founding members: Members who function

All nonprofit boards are different, and depending on the size of your organiza-
tion, your relationship with the board may be more or less involved. In a small 
agency, you may have a close, teamlike relationship with the entire board. In a 
larger organization, you may work only with the development committee, and 
even that relationship may have a formal feeling to it.
Enlisting the Board to Help 
Advance Your Cause
Which board members make the best fundraisers? First and foremost, effective 
fundraisers are people who care. A board member who has been personally 
affected by the illness your nonprofit fights or touched by the services 
you offer makes a great ally. Hopefully, your board members also bring the 
richness of their experience, the expertise of their professions, and the 
financial, social, and strategic resources they have to the organization, the 
board at large, and the individuals served by the organization. Each area of 
expertise can offer you a fresh perspective on how to find, approach, and 
connect with donors — whether they’re individuals, corporations, or granting 
programs.
 
Although you do hear a lot about board members’ financial resources in any 
given discussion on boards and fundraising, note that board service isn’t 
only for the wealthy. True, some board members are selected, at least in part, 
because they can give the organization access to donors in a certain income 
Finding the right folks to lead your organization
Great board members come from all walks of 
life. The best board members have a passion for 
your organization, the expertise or insight you 
need on your board, some experience in fund-
raising, and the willingness to commit their time 
and work hard. As the development person, you 
may be asked to help the executive director or 
board chair interview prospective board mem-
bers. Before you begin the interview process, 
identify the type of talent you need on your 
board by creating a skills inventory.
Begin by identifying categories for the experi-
ences and talents your board members have 
(business experience, financial skills, legal 
expertise, and so on). Then add a category that 
tracks personal characteristics that are impor-
tant to you, like gender, ethnicity, and location. 
This helps you ensure your board is diverse. 
Then list your existing board members and map 
out the qualities you would like to augment or 
add to your board’s skills.

 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
bracket. But not all board members are chosen for this reason. A healthy 
board needs to be diverse, and it needs to include some people who receive 
the services your organization offers.
In the following sections, we give you suggestions for enlisting your board 
members’ help in fundraising, explain the pros and cons of using a well-
known board member to ask for money, and offer some reasons why you may 
want to think about holding a board retreat.
Helping the board help you in fundraising
As the person responsible for finding funding for your organization, knowing 
how to work with the board to get the best result is crucial. Your develop-
ment role is vital to board members, who turn to you for the expertise as well 
as the day-to-day work in building relationships and raising funds.
In addition to the many oversight roles your board members may play, they 
can also play a major part in the fundraising. Here are some specific ways 
you can encourage them to help you in your fundraising efforts:
 
✓ Set the standard for giving in your organization. Let your board mem-
bers know that they can impact the amount others give to your organi-
zation just by giving their own donations. Having a 100 percent giving 
board (meaning that every board member contributes some amount of 
money to your organization) sends a strong message of support to staff, 
other donors, committee members, volunteers, and the public. After all, 
your giving board serves as a model of care for your mission.
 
✓ Participate in fundraising training. Invite your board members to sit in 
on fundraising training sessions to help them feel comfortable talking to 
others about the mission of your organization. Practice the process of 
asking for donations so that they’re comfortable asking for money if the 
opportunity arises. (See Chapter 10 for more on the process of asking 
for donations.)
 
✓ Open their address books. Pass out a blank piece of paper at the begin-
ning of a meeting and ask board members to write the names and phone 
numbers (or e-mail addresses) of three people they think you should 
contact this week. All board members should be willing to put you in 
touch with people they know who may be interested in the work your 
organization is doing.
 
✓ Help you with the checks and balances. If you have questions about ethi-
cal practices, fundraising approaches, or accounting procedures, know 
whom to ask on your board. After all, the board is responsible for setting 
up systems to test the credibility and accountability of the organization.

70
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
✓ Provide input on your case statement, mission, and goals. Although 
you may draft your case statement and fundraising plan, you must give 
it to the board for approval. The board offers suggestions and changes 
and then holds you to your milestones. (See Chapter 6 for more on 
developing your fundraising plan.)
Balancing the attraction of 
high-profile board members
The members of your board who have some visibility in your community 
or industry area make great spokespeople for your organization. As the 
development person, realize that you have a golden opportunity to build on 
board members’ visibility and reputation. Both volunteers and donors — and 
prospective future board members — may be drawn to your organization 
because of the presence of a well-known board member.
A fundraiser’s guide to board committees
Depending on the size of your organization and 
the amount of time you spend working directly 
with board members on matters of fundrais-
ing, you may find it helpful to have a working 
knowledge of the types of committees that may 
comprise your board.
Whether you’re dealing with a large or small 
board, having a committee structure enables 
the board to divide up responsibilities and make 
more effective use of its members’ already-
limited time. The executive committee may 
meet quarterly throughout the year, while the 
other committees, which are organized to fulfill 
different parts of the organization’s responsibil-
ities, meet in the interim as needed or as sched-
uled to accomplish their specific goals. Here’s a 
quick guide to what the various committees on 
your board may do:
 ✓ Executive committee: Acts on behalf of the 
board when the entire board can’t meet
 ✓ Development committee: Establishes, 
leads, and evaluates fundraising efforts for 
the organization
 ✓ Finance committee: Oversees the finan-
cial commitments and investments of the 
organization
 ✓ Nominating committee: Identifies, recruits, 
and nominates prospective board members 
and officers
 ✓ Governance committee: Oversees the way 
in which the organization is run, evaluated, 
and supported
 ✓ Program committee: Oversees the organi-
zation’s programs
 ✓ Public relations committee: Acts to estab-
lish and build the organization’s identity in 
the community through public relations

71
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
 
A board member’s fame can go two ways. On the one hand, an experienced, 
high-profile board member can be a great advantage to your cause — depend-
ing on the nature of the member’s personality and renown. On the other hand, 
a board member’s public popularity can overshadow your cause or even take 
your message in directions you hadn’t intended.
To keep things in a positive framework, consider these simple guidelines:
 
✓ Recognize and acknowledge the benefit your organization receives 
because of the involvement of all your board members.
 
✓ Cultivate good relationships with all board members and strategize 
ways to bring visibility to the organization with the specific purpose of 
attracting funds and supporters.
 
✓ Invite honesty and open communication set in a framework of collabora-
tion among all the board members.
 
✓ Help boost the visibility of all your board members by listing their 
names on your organization’s letterhead and Web site and inviting them 
to serve as spokespersons on projects that have a public component.
Walking your Board through 
Tough Decisions
In times of economic challenge, your board members, as leaders of your orga-
nization, will face some tough decisions. Charged with both the stewardship 
of your organization’s legacy and a plethora of decisions that reflect today’s 
realities, your board may have to focus only on the essentials.
The first priority is survival. As the development person, you may be asked 
to make a presentation to the board on the status of current and projected 
fundraising campaigns. This information helps the board develop a timeline 
for the future when cuts in programs or cuts in staff may be necessary.
 
Doing this kind of analysis with the staff present gives them confidence in the 
organization’s approach and builds trust that your board makes plans affect-
ing the entire group thoughtfully and in the open.
Getting down to brass tacks on the key issues — and knowing where your orga-
nization draws its line — can bring an important (and, we hope, catalytic) point 
of clarity to your board. The conversation may go something like this:
“Last year our fundraising brought in this much. This year we got this 
much. How long can we function with our current income stream without 
making substantial cuts?”

72
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
“. . . without cutting staff positions?”
“. . . without closing locations?”
“. . . without eliminating part — or all — of some programs?”
“. . . without reducing the number of individuals we serve?”
Identifying clear trigger points gives you a plan for action in case the orga-
nization’s assets drop to one of the trigger levels you’ve identified. When a 
particular trigger point shows up in the monthly report, the board and staff 
both know the action they need to take. And if that trigger point never comes 
and you never need to make the associated reductions, great! But having the 
plan in advance empowers your board to act when and if they need to make 
some difficult calls.
 
Especially in challenging economic times, getting your board together — away 
from the office — can spark creative ideas and renew energy and commit-
ment. A few simple guidelines will help your retreat be effective:
 
✓ Plan well in advance so all board members can adjust their calendars 
and be present
 
✓ Hire an outside person to facilitate so that you can participate in the 
brainstorming
 
✓ Keep your costs down by creating a nice but not luxurious environment
 
✓ State the results you expect, going in. This helps you focus your collec-
tive vision and come out with renewed passion and vigor for leading 
your organization in the months ahead.
The following sections give you pointers on choosing what areas of your non-
profit are the most important to maintain and when dipping into your endow-
ment nest egg is a good idea. You also may be faced with new opportunities, 
so we help you figure out whether the time is right to take advantage of them 
or whether you’re better off waiting. Finally, we explain how you can help 
your team see that you’ll all get through the current rough patch eventually.
Slating and prioritizing your issues
Knowing the answers to the questions about your income stream and operat-
ing and program costs gives your organization a game plan to follow if your 
current economic situation continues. It also helps you know where to begin 
making changes when changes are necessary. For instance, instead of reduc-
ing positions, you may choose to suspend or cancel one of your programs, 
look for alternate ways to deliver services that cut costs, or find a partner-
ing organization to share services and overhead. For example, to cut costs 
in response to challenging times, two arts organizations in the same city 
decided to share the same administrative staff, and two ballet companies in 
two different cities decided to share the same scenery.

73
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
 
You can use a number of analytic models to help you determine what your 
organization has to work with and what it needs to work on. SWOT (strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) is one such method of evaluation that 
helps you and your board brainstorm about the various assets and liabilities 
in your current organization. Using the SWOT method gives you the informa-
tion you need to develop an informed and effective strategic plan for your 
organization.
Understanding the relationship between your organization’s income and 
costs also helps you revisit and reevaluate the various priorities your orga-
nization holds dear. Whom do you serve? How do you serve them? Are your 
mission, service, and programs in alignment, or is your organization reaching 
into new areas that are beyond the scope of your focused goal? Slating and 
prioritizing your procedures and programs shows you clearly what’s negotia-
ble and what’s not — and helps your board make clear decisions about what 
should continue in tough economic times and what simply can’t.
 
Be aware that you may encounter sacred cows as you start the prioritization 
conversation among your board members and staff. You’re likely to hear people 
say, “Oh we can’t stop doing that — we’ve been doing it for 50 years. . . .” But 
the question is, will your organization still be around 50 years from now (or 
even 5) if you continue that practice?
 
One fairly simple change that can bring a big return over time is changing your 
messaging about the type of funding you invite. No organization can get far 
without operating funds, and yet major giving programs, endowments, and 
special campaigns often attract donors who want to give to specific programs, 
not just to operating costs. Increase your messaging around your annual fund 
campaign so that donors understand why their nonrestricted gifts are vital to 
the long-term sustainability of your organization.
Knowing when to use reserved funds
When donations drop, some organizations turn to their endowments and look 
for creative ways to draw more income without invading the corpus (original 
value) of the endowment. Invading the corpus is a serious matter. First, doing 
so breaks your promise to the donors who gave to the endowment as a per-
petual investment for the organization, and, in some cases, invading the corpus 
might mean breaking the law. Typically, organizations draw down 5 percent of 
the endowment, based on an amount taken from the endowment’s value aver-
aged over the last 36 months. In times of financial hardship, some organiza-
tions increase the percentage of the draw to 6 or 7 percent.
 
Note that in some states, increasing the percentage of the draw from endow-
ments may be a violation of law. Check the laws in your state to determine 
whether increasing your draw is an acceptable practice in your area.

74
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
 
One governance idea that helps manage changes in using reserved funds 
involves having a separate board (or in a smaller organization, a committee) 
to oversee the endowment. This separate entity provides a kind of check and 
balance for the endowment.
When an organization’s income is substantially down and programs and fund-
raising campaigns aren’t bringing in the needed revenue, questions about 
other possible revenue streams are sure to come up. If your organization’s 
financial statement shows extra cash — perhaps because your programs 
have not been well attended and you have money in your budget for program 
supplies — you can reasonably use that money to sustain your programs.
Figuring out when to launch 
into unchartered waters
If your fundraising is flat and the economy is flatter, how do you know when 
the problem is your organization’s image and when it’s just the fallout of a 
bad economy? Knowing when and how to extend your mission or add a pro-
gram (in an effort to build fundraising capacity) is an act of faith, art, and will.
Being aware of the area you serve, as well as the changing needs and inter-
ests of the world around you, can help you and your board take advantage 
of opportunities that come your way. Here are a few questions that can help 
you determine whether a new direction is a good option:
 
✓ Does the new direction you’re considering extend your mission in a 
logical way?
 
✓ Will you be adding service for an audience you already serve, or will you 
need to find a channel to an entirely new audience group?
 
✓ Do you have systems in place to support your new initiative?
 
✓ Can you easily secure support in terms of partnerships, funding, talent, 
and visibility? The more natural the fit, the better. Partnerships can 
extend the visibility of your organization and bring new energy and 
attention to your cause, while reducing your costs and helping you meet 
your mission more completely.
At first it may seem counterintuitive to launch a new program in the midst 
of a challenging financial time. But depending on the factors you identify as 
influencing your drop in fundraising, you may be able to find smart new oppor-
tunities that you overlooked in more abundant times. You may discover, for 
example, that you could be offering your services to a group that would be a 
more natural fit (and require less marketing) than the group you’re serving 
now. For example, perhaps in a time of skyrocketing job loss, your occupa-
tional program for senior citizens could be easily — and inexpensively — 

75
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
expanded to include all job seekers. With minimal investment, you could share 
your program with a larger group, meet a critical need in your current land-
scape, and greatly expand the number of people who know about and have 
access to your organization.
 
As a general rule, donors get tired of emergency calls for help — if your orga-
nization seems to be continually in crisis, sooner or later constituents wonder 
how well your association is managed. So when the money isn’t coming in as 
fast as you need it to, it’s okay to cry “Wolf!” sometimes. But if a specific situ-
ation needs immediate attention — for example, homelessness is reaching 
crisis proportions and the weather forecasters say the temperature will be 
dangerously low this week — getting the word out to your donors that you 
need help is a good thing.
Helping your organization find 
clarity in challenging times
Leading a nonprofit organization is an awesome task. The board is charged 
with holding in trust the legacy of the past, working for success in the pres-
ent, and thinking and planning for the future.
One way to help your board members plug into a common organizational 
identity — past, present, and future — and mobilize them for positive, cre-
ative action, is to use a nonprofit timeline. You can create a timeline with the 
board and staff to spotlight key moments, challenges, changes, and people in 
your organization’s history; then set that timeline against a backdrop of what 
was happening in the economy and culture at the time those key events were 
happening. To get started, on big pieces of butcher paper, write the start 
date (when your organization was founded) and the end date (the present), 
and then plot the following items on the timeline:
 
1. Events of significance in the organization
 
2. Dates when employees joined and left the organization (these dates are 
great for your staff to see)
 
3. Important historic events that occurred in your community and nationally 
(for example, you might add “Beatles come to America,” “Moon landing,” 
or “Hurricane Katrina hits” to your timeline at the appropriate dates)
Divide your board and staff into teams and have each team talk about what 
they know of major events in your organization’s history; then come together 
and assemble the timeline together. This activity gives you a sense of history 
as well as the realization that you’ve come through tough times before . . . 
and you will again. Even better, this exercise may spark some creative ideas 
that can help you chart your course out of the rough waters.

Discovering the True Value of Volunteers
If you’ve worked with — or volunteered for — a nonprofit organization in 
the past, you know volunteers are at the very center of the work you do. 
Volunteers are the hands, eyes, and hearts of the service you offer; their 
passion tells your story; their belief in your organization helps it grow. By 
developing a healthy, growing, appreciated volunteer corps, you not only 
provide people to perform your organization’s mission, but also bring 
together a group of people who will carry the spirit forward, which is espe-
cially important in challenging economic times.
Bad news and nonprofits
Nonprofit organizations are in the news all the 
time — sometimes because of great, need-
meeting programs, altruistic acts of service, or 
innovative approaches. Occasionally, though, 
an organization makes the news for less uplift-
ing reasons: broken promises, mismanaged 
funds, or questions about ethical (or unethical) 
practices.
When an organization experiences a run of bad 
news, the board helps frame a response and set 
a course of action. In general, the board deals 
with one of two kinds of negatives. In the first 
case, an organization fails to fulfill its promises, 
which in times of economic downturn is a fairly 
common story. In the second case, an organiza-
tion gets bad press — and rightly so, we think — 
when it uses illegal or morally questionable 
fundraising techniques. The first case is regret-
table and may require a forthcoming message 
from the board explaining the steps that the 
organization is taking to correct the problem. 
The second case is the more dire circumstance 
that calls for direct and visible action from the 
board — otherwise, the news may damage the 
organization’s reputation and have a negative 
impact on the entire field of fundraising.
A now legendary fall from grace in the non-
profit community happened almost 15 years 
ago at United Way. The CEO at that time had 
served a number of good years with the agency 
when he lost sight of his mission and began 
making unethical and unwise choices. When 
the fiscal abuses came to light, the United Way 
movement — and, in fact, the entire nonprofit 
community — was tarnished. Donors won-
dered whether their money was going to fund 
actual programs or hidden agendas.
An extensive evaluation of the situation 
revealed that the board, which had appeared 
to be the best possible board an organization 
could have, dropped the ball. No one knew 
what was going on. No one asked questions. 
The board as a whole had abdicated its role as 
guardian of the ethical standards for the orga-
nization, and in doing so, had paved the way for 
a situation that had a very negative impact on 
public perception.
Today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) helps to 
ensure best practices in governance for pub-
licly traded companies, but it also suggests to 
nonprofit organizations that voluntarily adopt-
ing best practices for board governance is the 
best way to ensure long-term, ethical oversight.

Oxley on the nonprofit community, see

sector.org.

 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
Even though volunteers are, well, volunteering, they should feel good about 
the role they play, and they have to be willing to be professional about their 
commitment to your organization. Your volunteers need to go through an 
interview process and a complete training program before they commit to a 
volunteer schedule. (We give you the lowdown on finding and recruiting vol-
unteers in the next section.)
Happy volunteers are the ones who get to use their gifts and talents in the 
roles they play. So if you have a volunteer who has a knack for or an interest in 
fundraising, assign him or her to your fundraising committee or give the volun-
teer an active role in your next special event. (More on this topic in a minute.)
 
Do your volunteers wear many hats in your organization? In small organizations, 
a single volunteer may be worked so hard she burns out in a short amount of 
time. Watch out for the 80/20 rule — which is when 20 percent of the people do 
80 percent of the work. People carrying the 80 percent can tire quickly, which 
doesn’t do you or the volunteers any good. If you find yourself in the middle 
of an 80/20 situation, review the talents and interests of your less-involved vol-
unteers and see whether you can inspire some of them into more active roles. 
Sometimes a thoughtful invitation and a little appreciation go a long way toward 
helping a lukewarm volunteer feel important to your organization.
Seeking volunteers
Finding wonderful, dedicated volunteers is no small task: Whole committees 
exist with the sole purpose of building, leading, and growing volunteer bases. 
We hope you’ve already acquired a thriving volunteer group that you can 
continue to grow, but if you haven’t, here’s what you need to do to find good 
volunteers:
 
✓ Know what — and whom — you need. Identify the areas in which you 
want to enlist volunteer help. Have specifics — jobs, times, tasks, and 
relationships — in mind. The more you plan these areas, the better your 
chances of finding and keeping just the right volunteers.
 
✓ Plan where you want to look for volunteers. Think about where you 
can find good volunteers for your particular charitable organization. 
Looking in a vet’s office for volunteers for an animal shelter is a logical 
match. Contacting schoolteachers or local writers may be your best bet 
if your organization focuses on increasing literacy.
 
✓ Start with your board. Introduce the idea of building your volunteer 
group at a board meeting. Ask board members to suggest people they 
know who may be interested in serving on a committee or volunteering 
their time.
 
 As part of your board, you may have a nominating committee that’s 
in charge of identifying and recruiting volunteer board members. 
Additionally, depending on the makeup of your particular board and the 

78
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
size of your organization, you may have a committee that identifies, builds, 
and trains your other volunteer staff. Make sure these committees are in 
communication. After all, a volunteer who isn’t willing to take on all the 
responsibilities of a board member may be willing to take on a smaller task.
 
✓ Review your volunteer list. Take a look at your existing volunteer list. 
Do you see patterns in the volunteers’ other activities that may provide 
access to other volunteers? For example, do some volunteers belong to 
a gardening club that may be a good place to make a presentation for 
your organization? Do some belong to a fraternity? A civic group?
 
✓ Target families of volunteers. Often the families of volunteers are a 
good place to find not only donors, but volunteers, as well. For example, 
volunteerism among teens is growing and presents a great opportunity 
for progressive-minded charitable organizations. In fact, according to 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 2008, 21.9 percent of all vol-
unteers are in the 16–24 age range.
 
✓ Look at your personal network of friends and associates. Ask some-
body who owes you a favor if she can help out your organization. If you 
volunteered for another organization, maybe someone in that group is 
willing to return the favor. Scan your own personal mailing lists. Take a 
look at your holiday card list. Look for anyone who may be interested in 
helping out your cause.
 
✓ Consider the people your organization serves. Have you considered 
your clients as a possible source of volunteers? For example, if you work 
for a small business development center, someone who has mastered 
valuable business techniques (thanks to your program) may be interested 
in passing them along. If your immunization program for preschoolers 
reaches neighborhood parents, you may find that moms and dads who 
have benefited from your services want to help others do the same.
 
In times of economic downturn, you may find that the unemployed or the 
underemployed are more motivated than ever to volunteer with an organiza-
tion they see as having a worthwhile mission. Volunteering gives them the 
opportunity to network, meet new people, and learn new skills. And yes, vol-
unteering does have a spot on a résumé.
Establishing a productive relationship
After you’ve found the right people to help your organization perform its mis-
sion, it’s time to put your volunteers to work (in the nicest possible way, of 
course).
One of the most important parts of building working relationships with your 
volunteers is being clear about what you want them to do. Give them specific 
requests for action. Don’t say, “I want you to do a mailing.” Instead, say, “I’d 

79
 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
love it if you could spend two hours a week on Tuesdays stuffing envelopes for 
us.” Sure, being that direct takes a little gall, but it’s absolutely necessary — 
after all, if you don’t ask for what you want, you won’t get it.
 
If a volunteer tells you she can’t do what you asked her to do, be willing to 
bargain down. If you ask a volunteer to put up 500 yard signs, for example, be 
willing to bargain down to perhaps just 25 signs if she says no initially.
Another way to build a productive, working relationship with your volunteers 
is to have regular report meetings a couple of times a year so your volunteers 
can see all the other people who are also volunteering. These meetings build 
esprit de corps and help individuals feel like they’re an important part of a 
larger effort. And, finally, don’t forget the all-important thank-you meeting — 
after all, you can ask your volunteers to sign up for the next project at that 
meeting!
Using your volunteers as fundraisers
As you become more aware of who your volunteers are and what they’re doing, 
you may notice that a select group of them may be of great help to you in 
fundraising. Volunteers can be very effective as fundraising team members. In 
fact, at one point in our fundraising experience, we brought in a team of volun-
teers to raise $125,000, giving each of them the responsibility of raising $5,000 
through their own donations, friends, families, and peers. We selected and 
trained each volunteer carefully, and every one met his or her fundraising goal.
Ways to say “thank you!”
You can find countless ways to recognize espe-
cially dedicated and helpful volunteers. If you’re 
creative and genuine in giving your thanks, your 
volunteers are sure to feel appreciated. Here 
are just a few examples of how to say “thanks!”
 ✓ Say “thank you” with a smile and mean it.
 ✓ Send a card with a personal note.
 ✓ Invite the volunteer to lunch.
 ✓ Have a recognition dinner for special 
volunteers.
 ✓ Give out certificates of recognition.
 ✓ Submit a thank-you note to your local 
paper.
 ✓ Mention your volunteer’s work in your orga-
nization’s newsletter.
 ✓ Ask the volunteer to speak to a group of 
new volunteers.
 ✓ Give a plaque of recognition.
 ✓ Dedicate a publication or event to your 
volunteers.
 ✓ Throw a volunteer party.

80
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
A volunteer can get directly involved in fundraising in many different ways, 
including serving on a development committee; helping you find sponsors for 
special events or publications; writing, printing, or addressing letters; serving 
at a special event; meeting donors during a donor visit; or hosting a donor 
luncheon.
 
How do you know which of your volunteers would be helpful in your fundrais-
ing efforts? Look for the following qualities in your fundraising candidates:
 
✓ Contagious passion
 
✓ Ability to lead others
 
✓ Strong organizational skills
 
✓ Friendly, open manner
 
✓ Ability to follow through
 
✓ Talent for working on a team
 
Fundraising isn’t for everyone. Even if a specific volunteer is a great speaker, 
an outgoing person, and a valuable member of the community, if she isn’t 
comfortable asking for money, the donors she approaches won’t be comfort-
able either. Part of respecting the volunteer-agency relationship means using 
the talents volunteers want to offer, which doesn’t involve coercing people 
into roles they don’t want to play.

In the next 20 years or so you may find yourself in the midst of a gold mine of 
volunteer talent. Baby boomers are now entering retirement years and have 
skills you need (think computer and business skills), good health and energy, 
and ample time to commit to your cause. As a generation, baby boomers are 
industrious, capable, independent, and value driven. Those people comfort-
able with money — and people — will make absolutely great fundraisers; they 
have the confidence, tact, and personality they need to succeed. This genera-
tion is also mission driven; they’ve paid their corporate dues and are now look-
ing for ways to get back to the altruistic orientation of their younger years.
As you try to attract senior volunteers to your cause, keep in mind the 
following tips:

 Chapter 5: Organizing Your Team: Board Members and Volunteers
 
✓ Retirees want to feel their continued value to society. Volunteering is a 
structured way to feel like part of something worthwhile.
 
✓ Some retired people use volunteer work as a way to reproduce the role 
they played in a paying job.
 
✓ Older volunteers may need special considerations in terms of doing 
certain types of work (lifting 50 pound boxes is out!) or needing handi-
capped access to your facilities.
 
✓ People in their 60s and 70s are much more active and productive than 
they have ever been, and they are not only comfortable as volunteers 
and program leaders but good fits for online services as well. Never 
underestimate these vital, energetic, and intelligent people who are 
smart and have life skills to contribute to your mission.
 
How do you reach out to retirees and seniors and attract them to your orga-
nization’s cause? First, make the effort to go to them. Find out about organiza-
tions, neighborhoods, and causes in your area that baby boomers are involved 
in. Make a speech at a community center, meet folks at an arts organization, or 
see whether you can have a few minutes’ time at local service club meetings 
of Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, and Elks. Reaching out to them directly is definitely 
your best bet for bringing these talented people closer to your mission.

W
hat exactly do you need to have before you can start raising funds? 
No organization can exist for very long on good intentions alone. 
To be a successful fundraiser, you need to be able to demonstrate to your 
donors (1) what you have, (2) what you need, (3) how you plan to get it, and 
(4) how you plan to account for it after you receive it.
In this chapter we talk about the fundraising plan — your road map and the 
modus operandi for your short- and long-term fundraising strategies. Not 
only will a good plan help you attract support from people inside and outside 
your organization, but it will also provide a chart for you to steer by as you 
navigate through uncertain economic times.
Drafting the Perfect Plan
When the economy is pitching and swaying and you aren’t sure how long you 
can even keep the doors open, putting time and energy into envisioning the 
future of your organization 12 or 18 months down the road may seem like a 
waste of time. But creating a well-thought-out fundraising plan is more than 
an empty exercise of wishful thinking. The time and energy you invest in cre-
ating a well-ordered, thoughtful plan can pay great dividends by helping you 
assess all the potential revenue streams you have and figure out how you can 
develop each of those channels more fully.

84
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Your fundraising plan needs to include the following items:
 
✓ Clear statement of your mission: Your case statement.
 
✓ Fundraising goal: What program or other goal you’re raising money for.
 
✓ Needs statement: Description of your fundraising market and resources.
 
✓ Financial target: Goals you want to reach. You may want to set targets 
at different intervals, such as six months, one year, two years, and five 
years.
 
✓ Selected fundraising method(s): What types of fundraising campaigns 
you plan to use to reach your goals.
 
✓ Targeted markets: The different donor groups that different campaigns 
may appeal to and how you plan to reach them.
When you write up your fundraising plan, you need to include specific infor-
mation, such as the overall time frame, the benchmark goals you want to 
make during that period, the resources you plan to use, some information 
on campaign leadership, and the fundraising budget for the campaign. Don’t 
have a budget yet? No worries; we give you the scoop on creating a budget 
in the “Budgeting Your Fundraising Efforts” section later in this chapter. The 
following sections get you started with your fundraising plan.
 
Make sure the people who will carry out your fundraising plan are part of the 
creation process. Nobody wants to hear, “We just decided that our goal is to 
raise $1 million this year. Do you think you can do that?”
Starting with the case statement
The first step in building your fundraising plan is to write your organization’s 
case statement — your carefully expressed reason for being — which we 
discuss in detail in Chapter 4. If you don’t have a copy of your organization’s 
case statement in front of you, get one. We’ll wait.
Starting with the case statement is a must because this statement includes 
the goals and objectives you set for your organization, which are essential 
parts of your fundraising plan.
Identifying your goals
After you’ve identified your organization’s mission with the help of the case 
statement, it’s time to describe what your organization wants to fund — in 
other words, it’s time to draft your goals. You may need to generate money 
for programs, raise funds for operating costs, cover the costs of expanding 
your offices, or build an endowment. Or you may want to do all of the above.

85
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
Most nonprofit organizations have four primary fundraising goals. They need 
funding for
 
✓ Programs: These enable you to fulfill your mission.
 
✓ Everyday operations: These include all the costs involved in running 
your organization day to day.
 
✓ Capital enhancements: These include building renovations and other 
facility improvements.
 
✓ Building an endowment: An endowment enables you to provide for 
your organization’s long-term future.
 
In times of economic turbulence, you probably have a fifth fundraising goal: 
survival (keeping the doors open and the lights on). Achieving this goal may 
mean looking for creative partnerships or putting your general operating fund 
front and center.
Identifying your specific fundraising goals is key to setting up your plan. 
Just saying “We have to raise money — for everything!” isn’t going to get 
you very far. Whatever your fundraising goals are, apply these three ques-
tions to each goal:
 
✓ Why do we want to achieve this particular goal?
 
✓ What benchmarks are involved in achieving this goal?
 
✓ How much will achieving this goal cost?
Your answers to these questions need to be focused and specific. What you 
come up with eventually becomes your goals statement.
Building a needs statement
After you get clear on your mission and identify your specific fundraising 
goals, you’re ready to consider how you plan to reach those goals. The fol-
lowing five questions help you define the big picture of your fundraising plan:
 
✓ What resources do you have?
 
✓ What resources do you need?
 
✓ Where have you come up short recently?
 
✓ Which fundraising method is the right one for you?
 
✓ Which market (the people or groups you turn to for money) do you want 
to approach?

86
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Armed with the answers to these questions, you can create your needs state-
ment, which summarizes how you’ll go about raising funds. This statement 
helps you get a clearer picture of what you have and what you need.
Assessing your existing resources
So far you’ve been laying out your overall fundraising approach. The next 
step is to gather specific information for your fundraising plan and identify 
the people who will help drive it. If you already have a lot of information 
about your organization’s previous plan and the people available to help 
make it work, you may not need to start your fundraising plan from scratch. 
Either way, here are the essential items you need to include as you consider 
your organization’s existing resources:
 
✓ The donor list
 
✓ Histories of the amounts your donors have contributed in the past
 
✓ Fundraising strategies your organization’s previous fundraisers used — 
and how much money they raised
 
✓ Any market studies done by your organization gauging public awareness 
of your organization
 
✓ Public relations materials used in the past (membership brochures, 
annual reports, copies of press releases, and so on)
 
✓ A list of potential donors
 
✓ A list of the volunteers or staff who participated in past fundraising efforts
 
✓ A list of the board members experienced in fundraising
 
✓ A detailed description of a specific program or campaign that directly 
addresses your needs statement
 
If your agency has done fundraising previously in any sort of organized way, 
you may already have some of this information available to you. If you’re new 
to the organization or the fundraising role, ask someone who’s been with the 
nonprofit for a few years to help you round up this data.
Before you start writing your fundraising plan, you may need to do some 
research. Taking some time now to investigate what’s been done before can 
save you valuable time later and help you focus your efforts and resources. 
If you discover, for example, that a program appeal fell flat two years ago, 
you can carefully investigate the whys behind that bomb before you launch 
a similar program. The economic climate may have been much different two 
years ago, but you can still benefit from looking carefully at a campaign post-
mortem. Also remember that you aren’t limited to financial statements and 

87
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
donor reports; you can engage long-time volunteers and board members to 
get some great stories and insights about previous fundraising efforts and 
their results.
Determining what you need
After you have a sense of the resources you already have, you can determine 
what you still need as you get organized for fundraising. The following list 
provides a few possibilities:
 
✓ Updated mission statement and goals: If your organization already has a 
mission statement and a list of fundraising goals, you still need to look at 
them carefully to update them to fit your organization’s current situation.
 
✓ Development committee: This committee isn’t a must, but it’s helpful if 
you have the people power.
 
✓ Complete slate of board members: This list includes all your board mem-
bers, not just those with fundraising experience. And don’t forget to incor-
porate training for the members who are inexperienced in fundraising.
 
✓ Donor list: This all-important list is the database of all donors who have 
ever given to your organization in any capacity.
 
✓ Assessment of public opinion regarding your organization: You might 
think of this as your “brand” — what do people think of when someone 
mentions your organization?
 
✓ Clients or previous clients: Your clients are the people who need what 
you offer or who have benefitted from your programs in the past.
Setting your financial targets
The leadership of your organization — the board, the executive director, and 
the program director — are responsible for telling you exactly how much 
money you need to raise as your organization’s fundraiser. You may be in on 
the discussions, of course, especially when they get to the “Do you think it’s 
doable?” part, but the financial targets are really up to them to decide.
If you’ve seen a big decline in revenues or you’ve recently seen your invest-
ment values plummet, you may be understandably wary about setting specific 
financial targets. When the economy goes topsy-turvy, gauging when things 
will stabilize is anybody’s guess. Even when times are tough, however, the best 
approach is to keep your eyes on your goal and keep moving forward — this is 
no time to lessen your expectations for fundraising. You can create the targets 
with the best information and insight you and your board can pull together, 
knowing that some factors, like the economy, may be outside your control.

88
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Plan your fundraising targets for
 
✓ The present: Funding for current expenses, such as a summer program, 
the acquisition of a van, or the salary of a special speaker.
 
✓ The short term: Funding for upcoming expenses, such as for the next 
semester, the next year, or until a specific program ends.
 
✓ The long term: Funding for a three-year plan or an endowment plan.
 
✓ A cash reserve: Funding to help you navigate through uncertain finan-
cial waters. Plan to tuck away three to six months’ worth of operating 
funds for a potentially rainy day.
 
Some organizations do extensive testing before they set and announce their 
fundraising targets. In a capital campaign, for example, your fundraisers and 
staff do much of the work — and raise a good portion of the money through 
major lead gifts — before the campaign is even announced publicly. Why? 
Because success breeds success, and people like to give to a campaign that’s 
going well. When you can announce your new campaign and present graphs 
that illustrate that you’re already 35 percent of the way to your financial goal, 
you inspire others to give.
Putting the all-powerful 
giving pyramid to work
One tool that’s extremely helpful in planning for the realization of your finan-
cial goal is the giving pyramid. The giving pyramid helps you visualize (and 
communicate) how you make your revenue. It can also help you determine 
how many large gifts you need to obtain to reach different benchmarks in 
your target amount. For example, suppose that the first benchmark of your 
three-year fundraising plan is to raise $250,000 the first year. The giving pyra-
mid can help you find out how many gifts at various levels you need to reach 
that goal. Figure 6-1 shows you what the giving pyramid looks like.
Not long ago, while we were working on an annual campaign for a major non-
profit organization, we were aiming at a goal of $300,000, which was made up 
mostly of small gifts. But twice during that campaign, people walked into the 
office, took out their checkbooks, and said something like, “You know, I’ve 
been coming here for more than five years and just love it. Here’s a check 
for $25,000.” We were floored both times. The moral of the story? Count on 
the smaller gifts, but don’t forget to cultivate major gifts along the way (see 
Chapters 9 and 10 for more about major gifts).

89
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
 
An old fundraising joke goes, “It’s easy to raise a million dollars! Just find a 
willing millionaire to write you that one big check.” In reality, though, it’s the 
multitude of smaller gifts, along with those well-cultivated major gifts, that 
bring you to your goal.

Goal-setting tips
Goal setting in tough times isn’t easy because 
you may not know what the financial landscape 
will look like 6 or 12 months down the road. Here 
are some tips to help you set workable goals for 
your organization no matter what the economy 
looks like:
 ✓ Make sure the people involved in the fund-
raising are involved in the goal setting as 
well.
 ✓ Be specific about how much you want to 
raise. Don’t use vague phrases, such as “as 
much as we can get.”
 ✓ Consider setting two goals — a lower one 
that the staff realizes is what you need to 
bring in to keep operating, and a higher goal 
you share with the public. That way you 
cover your bases in a shifting economy, and 
if you reach your higher goal, great — but 
if not, you still have what you need to keep 
the doors open.
 ✓ Set benchmarks for the campaign to moti-
vate you and your fellow fundraisers. Know 
how many $1,000 gifts you want to obtain by 
a certain date, for example.

Getting started with the right methods
Your fundraising plan includes all the campaigns, events, grants, and so on 
that you use for your overall fundraising strategy. When you begin a fundrais-
ing campaign, you first have to decide where you want to go — what your 
fundraising goals are. Then you have to choose which fundraising method (or 
means) you want to use to reach your goals. If you know you want to increase 
your donor base by 12 percent and reach a fundraising goal of $300,000 by 
year’s end, for example, you’ve already established the end point. What you 
need to do next is choose the right fundraising method that’ll get you there.
Understanding the different fundraising methods
The standard fundraising methods are
 
✓ Annual campaign: A yearly fundraising campaign to raise support for 
operating expenses (see Chapter 18)
 
✓ Major gifts: A one-time gift or repeated large gifts given to support a par-
ticular program or campaign, project, or improvement (see Chapter 21)
 
✓ Capital campaign: A fundraising campaign that adds to an organiza-
tion’s assets — providing money for a new building, for example (see 
Chapter 20)
 
✓ Planned gifts: Gifts that either add to the endowment of the organiza-
tion (see Chapter 23) or are scheduled to be received in the future (see 
Chapter 21)
Which fundraising method you use depends on your needs statement. If 
you’re raising funds for day-to-day operations, you want to create an annual 
fund campaign to reach that end. If you’re focusing on building an endow-
ment for your organization, think more along the lines of planned giving.
What about special events? We didn’t forget the black tie and tails you have 
hanging in the back of your closet. Special events can be great fundraisers 
when done right. Unless you’ve publicized that your organization will use 
the proceeds of your special event for a particular purpose, the moneys you 
raise at your event can go wherever you need them: the operating fund, the 
capital campaign, a special project, a particular program, or the endowment 
fund. We talk more about special events in Chapter 19.
Creating a method comparison worksheet
If you have a track record to use, look back through your fundraising budget 
for past campaigns. How much did you raise for your annual fund? How much 
did you spend raising that amount? Compare and contrast similar numbers for 
your direct mail campaign, your donor renewal program, your special events, 
and so on. Where did you break even? Where did you make significant money? 

91
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
Where did you take a loss? Use Table 6-1 to help compare the effectiveness 
(or lack thereof) of the fundraising methods your organization has used in the 
past. Doing so can help you choose which methods to use in the future.
Table 6-1 
Method Comparison Worksheet
Method
Income
Expenses*
Percentage 
(Income Divided 
by Expense)
*Include staff time in the expenses
 
When you calculate the expense of putting a particular method into action, 
don’t forget to include the staff time. You may need to estimate the number of 
hours staff members dedicated to working on a specific campaign or method 
and then use the hours multiplied by their wages to calculate the cost. Having 
even ballpark figures related to cost-per-hour can help you evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the method.
Discovering fundraising markets
The next step in creating your fundraising plan is to identify your markets: 
From where do you raise the majority of your funds? Again, if you’re an exist-
ing organization, you have data that gives you the answer pretty quickly. 
Look through the data carefully, but don’t get stuck in the past. If you’re 
just starting up, you need to put some thought and planning into where you 
should begin. Think about current economic trends, community issues, and 
the cultural climate before deciding on the right market and the right method 
for your effort.
The best fundraising plans don’t focus too heavily on any one market; 
instead, they mix and match constituencies to make sure they’re continually 
raising both short- and long-term funds. Consider the markets in Table 6-2, 
and think about the amount of time it takes to receive a gift from each.

92

Table 6-2 
Markets and More

Short-

Description
Individual 
donors
✓
✓
Individual donors comprise the biggest category of givers, providing 75 percent of all philan-
thropic contributions. Giving USA 2009 reports that individuals gave an estimated $229.28 billion 
dollars in 2008, in spite of the shaky economy. Your short-term donors may contribute to the 
annual fund, while long-term donors (who may develop into major givers or donors interested 
in making planned gifts) may give through a cultivated relationship with the agency. Your goal 
for individual donors is to get repeated gifts to the annual fund and to cultivate donors into other 
giving programs, as well. In 2008 in the U.S., charitable bequests — gifts left to nonprofit organi-
zations in donors’ wills — weighed in at $22.66 billion, which is 7 percent of all giving.
Affinity 
groups
✓
Affinity groups, such as professional associations or special interest groups, are usually a source 
of short-term, programmatic funding; they usually apply a specific time period to their donations.
Churches
✓
✓
Depending on your relationships with sponsoring churches, you may receive specific program sup-
port or ongoing operational support. Although you may receive small to medium gifts from many 
churches consistently, the likelihood that you’ll get a major gift from a church is small. Even so, the 
best market for major gifts — individual donors — may come to you through a church contact.
Corporations
✓
✓
Corporations are often more interested in funding a specific program — something they can 
see their name on or something that aligns with their product or service — than in providing for 
operational expenses or endowment concerns. Corporations provided an estimated $14.5 billion 
in 2008 contributions to nonprofit organizations, which is 5 percent of all giving. For a short-term 
relationship, corporations may supply program or equipment grants — over the long-term, expect 
to cultivate a partnering relationship. In times of economic upheaval, corporations may pare down 
philanthropic giving substantially while they work to shore up and stabilize their own operations.
Foundations
✓
Foundations, by and large, are interested in helping provide solutions, which means programs, 
programs, and more programs. Giving USA 2009 lists grant making by foundations at an estimated 
$41.21 billion in 2008, which is 13 percent of giving totals. Generally, foundations don’t want to 
fund either annual fund campaigns or the “bricks and mortar” of capital drives. In thinking about 
your funding needs, coming up with a grant proposal for a specific program that fits the mission 
of a particular foundation is a great way to meet short-term funding goals.
Government
✓
✓
Similar to corporations (but with a lot more red tape), the government may be able to provide your 
organization with program-related moneys, staff salaries, and perhaps even ongoing operational 
support. Long-term involvement is possible, although you won’t build a sizeable endowment from 
the support of government grants.

93
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
 
According to an article published by the American Enterprise Institute, low-
income working families may be the most generous givers in America (as of 
2008); they reportedly give charitable organizations an estimated 4.5 percent 
of their income.
When you start small, you may not be able to work from an established or 
tried-and-true plan. Begin with the people closest to you — people you see 
often, vendors you work with, community organizations that work with you in 
similar causes. As your circle widens, so does your market. Although shooting 
for the big grant from the major foundation is a worthwhile and perhaps profit-
able act, your overall fundraising plan will be healthier in the long term if you 
build the steady support with gifts from a variety of sources — many of whom 
should be close to home. Plus, foundations may want you to demonstrate your 
ability to raise funds before you approach them for a grant. If you submit a pro-
posal too early in the process, they may ask you to work at the program for a 
while before they consider your request for funding.
Avoiding Plan Busters like the Plague
Throughout this chapter, we talk about what you can do to put together your 
fundraising plan and begin working toward its success. One of the challenges 
Giving circles: A new and promising approach
In the last decade, a new kind of citizen phi-
lanthropy has brought a hopeful new opportu-
nity for fundraisers. Giving circles are groups 
of individuals who pool their money and other 
resources (like time) and decide collectively 
where to donate their funds. A 2009 study by Dr. 
Angela Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman found 
that donors in giving circles
 ✓ Give more than average donors because 
they’re aware of the impact their collective 
gift makes and because members inspire 
each other to give more
 ✓ Think more strategically about where they 
give because the group as a whole makes 
the decision
 ✓ Tend to be more engaged than average 
donors in the communities where they live
 ✓ Are more likely to talk about the causes 
they support with others in their lives
 ✓ Are likely to give to organizations that sup-
port women, the arts, and ethnic and minor-
ity groups
Giving circles often have their own processes 
that they use to determine what they’ll fund 
and how you can get your organization on their 
radar screens. Do some research to find out 
about giving circles in your area that may be 
open to receiving new proposals or hearing 
your presentation (or just having a conversa-
tion!). You can use the Giving Circle Directory 
created by the Forum of Regional Associations 
of Grantmakers (www.givingforum.org) 
to get started.

94
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
of fundraising in tough times is that even the best plan may take a while to 
come to fruition depending on the economic climate and other variables out-
side your control. In the meantime, here are a few red flags that you can — 
and should — watch out for along the way:
 
✓ Choosing the wrong leadership: The leadership for your fundraising 
effort has an enormous effect on the way others perceive their roles in 
your campaigns. Make sure you have positive, can-do people with willing 
attitudes and strong connections in your leadership roles; they can make 
a huge difference in the effectiveness of your fundraising campaigns.
 
✓ Not knowing your mission: Knowing your mission seems pretty basic, 
doesn’t it? Well, it’s not only basic; it’s essential. You aren’t going to be 
able to raise any money for your organization unless you know why your 
agency exists and whom you serve. Make sure you have a strong, clear 
case before you even think about fundraising.
 
✓ Having unrealistic expectations: Be realistic in your needs statement 
and in the goals you set as a result. If you raised $100,000 last year, you 
may be shooting too high to aim for $300,000 this year.
 
✓ Dealing with bad timing: If your organization has recently suffered 
a setback in the news — a board member resigned in anger; a legal 
suit is pending; a large funder just denied a gift — now may not be the 
best time to launch a fundraising campaign, but that doesn’t mean you 
should just drop out of the market. Think through your messaging, focus 
your campaign, and tell your story honestly and clearly to call atten-
tion to what really matters — getting your programs or services to the 
people who need them.
 
Can you run an annual fund and a capital campaign at the same time? Sure you 
can — and many organizations do. But in shaky financial times, this kind of 
undertaking may be impractical, impossible, or even dangerous. People and 
corporations who normally give to your annual campaign may think that their 
capital donation takes care of that contribution, as well — and as a result, 
your annual fund may come up short this year, especially given the fact that 
individuals in a shaky economy are looking at their checkbooks with more 
concern than usual. See Chapter 18 to find out more about annual funds; for 
capital campaigns, see Chapter 20.
Budgeting Your Fundraising Efforts
You’ve no doubt heard the phrase “it takes money to make money.” Well, this 
phrase holds true for fundraising just like any business endeavor. Essentially, 
you have to spend fundraising dollars to raise funds — a fact that may con-
cern some donors if your fundraising efforts seem too extravagant. And 

95
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
because you’re in the business of raising money, you better go about it in a 
businesslike way. To meet your goals most effectively, you need to carefully 
plan, budget, and account for all the money you bring in and spend.
A budget is a financial plan that shows how you intend to use your resources 
to pay the expenses you incur to fulfill your mission. Your fundraising budget, 
which your board approves as part of your organization’s overall budget, is 
an important planning instrument for you, as well as a great way to show your 
potential funders — whether those funders are individuals, corporations, or 
foundations — the black-and-white details of your fiscal responsibility.
 
Your organization’s budget requires a team to complete it. If you’re the execu-
tive director, you may do the first draft of the general budget, but the board 
will review — and likely revise — it after you’re done. As a development 
person, you may have to draft the fundraising portion of the overall budget. 
But, as with the case statement, be prepared to answer questions and make 
changes after the board review. And know that it’s never a bad idea to fly your 
proposed budget past your financial officer first, just to make sure you didn’t 
miss anything.
The following sections help you estimate how much money you need in order 
to raise the money that keeps your nonprofit going.
When opportunity strikes . . .
Out of the blue, a bolt of awareness may elec-
trify your cause. For example, take the current 
heated conversation in the United States about 
healthcare. This issue has stirred up (and right-
fully so) discussion on issues that touch all 
levels of family life, from the youngest to the 
oldest members of society. If your organiza-
tion’s mission relates to healthcare or social 
services, the current debate may help call 
attention to your cause.
Although you can’t prepare for such occur-
rences when you’re setting up your fundraising 
plan, be aware of the pulse of your environment. 
Identify issues that are related to you, and keep 
your eye on them. Take advantage of stories in 
the news — when the link is genuine — to help 
potential donors understand better than ever 
how your organization can help address the 
topic they’re concerned about.
If you think taking advantage of current events 
sounds distasteful to you — as though it’s 
in some way exploiting a big need in your 
society — think again. With a topic as seem-
ingly basic as good, universal healthcare, 
opinions get polarized, views grow stronger, 
and a wave of frustration — both personal and 
cultural — ripples through the culture. At times 
like these, society has a natural need for bal-
ance and action, and stories showing that good 
work is still being done, that people care, and 
that the people most in need are being cared 
for are more important than ever. If your orga-
nization can be a legitimate part of that healing 
and help provide some of the answers, you’re 
not exploiting anyone — you’re simply taking 
advantage of a real opportunity to further your 
mission.

Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Making sure you include everything in 
your budget . . . but don’t overbudget
The categories in your fundraising budget vary depending on the type of 
work your organization does, but a few basic ideas take effect across the 
board. First, make sure fundraising has its own section in the overall operat-
ing budget of your organization. In that budget, be ready to put down num-
bers for the following items:
 
✓ How much time you’re allocating for fundraising
 
✓ How much staff time will be spent in support of fundraising
 
✓ What the real expenses are for running your fundraising program
Second, when you’re planning out the expenses of your fundraising program, 
be sure to consider costs in all the following areas (the top four are likely 
to apply only to larger agencies and organizations; smaller organizations or 
community groups may have only one or two paid staff, if any):
 
✓ Salaries and wages
 
✓ Pension plan contributions
 
✓ Employee benefits
 
✓ Payroll taxes
 
✓ Supplies
 
✓ Telephone and Internet access
 
✓ Web site design and maintenance
 
✓ Utilities
 
✓ Postage and shipping
 
✓ Rent
 
✓ Equipment costs
 
✓ Printing and publications
 
✓ Travel
In times of economic transition, it can be a challenge to gauge how much you 
need to allocate for the various expenses your organization incurs. Two rules 
of thumb to keep in mind: First, include in your budget everything you’re 
likely to need for the year (including a cash reserve fund for emergencies), 
and project what you need, taking the current rate of inflation into consider-
ation. Second, go over your budget carefully — with the help of your board 
and key staff members — to weed out all unnecessary expenses and qualify 

97
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
the costs you project. A lean, effective budget based on your real needs and 
best-educated projections is much easier to track and manage in the long-run 
than a budget that is woefully underfunded or one that includes amounts 
earmarked for noncritical extras that tie up funds that could be used to reach 
more people and effect more good.
 
You may be familiar with Form 990 — the IRS form that nonprofits use to 
provide full disclosure of their activities and finances. While you’re putting 
together your budget, think about data you need to complete your 990 and 
plan your budget categories accordingly. (You can get a copy of the Form 990 
online at www.irs.gov.)
Figuring out the cost of raising money
So how much money does it take to make money? Different types of fundrais-
ing methods require different investments, but the range can run anywhere 
from a few cents on the dollar for major gifts, planned giving, and capital 
campaigns to upwards of 50 cents per dollar raised for special events. This 
wide range of costs is another reason why you need to make sure you select 
the right fundraising method for your campaign.
You may have heard stories about charitable organizations that take huge 
cuts for themselves — paying exorbitant salaries and taking huge liberties — 
from the dollars their supporters provide. These few organizations have cre-
ated a cloud of suspicion that every fundraiser must overcome — today’s 
donors want to know where their money is going and to see evidence that 
it is, in fact, going where you say it’s going. And when times are tight, your 
donors will want to be doubly sure the donations they give are going to good 
use. For this reason, you need to be open and forthcoming with your financial 
information and keep your fundraising and overhead costs as low as possible. 
This open communication is an important part of creating a solid, respectful 
donor-agency relationship, which is essential if you want to be successful.
Turning Elsewhere for Assistance
Fundraising is all about creating and cultivating relationships — with your 
board and staff, donors, volunteers, constituents, and the public. Much of 
the best work you do will be in partnership with others as you brainstorm 
plans, evaluate campaigns, come up with new initiatives, and design your 
approaches. As you put together your fundraising plan and test it out with 
those who know your organization best, you may want to consider using out-
side resources — including fundraising consultants or fundraising software — 
to help fill in any resource gaps you may identify.

98
Part I: Putting Your Fundraising Ducks in a Row 
Knowing when to outsource
Every nonprofit organization has more than enough fundraising work to go 
around. Whether that work goes to someone like you — hired to serve in a 
development role or volunteering to help the greater good — or to someone 
outside the organization is a very important decision that affects the overall 
effectiveness of your fundraising and your organization.
If your organization’s budget won’t yet support a salaried development 
person, you do have other options available. You can train a corps of vol-
unteers, but doing so can be a hefty responsibility if you’re thinking about 
doing a substantial fundraising campaign. Another option is to contract with 
a third-party company or consultancy to help you do the fundraising work. 
From feasibility studies to campaign strategies, from plans to event manage-
ment and reporting, third-party businesses are ready, willing, and able to 
take over campaign leadership and planning when you need help.
Good reasons to outsource may be
 
✓ You feel the time is right to launch a fundraising campaign but you don’t 
have the necessary leadership for the campaign on staff.
 
✓ You’re preparing to start your first fundraising effort and want to benefit 
from the expertise of an experienced consultant.
 
✓ You have a close working relationship with a third-party agency and feel 
that its objectivity would help you create and run a better campaign.
We urge you to think carefully about the pros and cons of putting your fund-
raising work into the hands of people who may not be working from the same 
point of passion that you and your board are coming from. Consider a few 
compromise solutions: Hire a third party to work closely with your board to 
The miracle of the development office
Years ago the Lilly Endowment was greatly 
concerned about the financial plight of theo-
logical seminaries in the United States. They did 
a survey of seminaries and found that almost 
no seminaries across the board, from liberal to 
conservative, had development offices.
In response, the Lilly Endowment created a 
granting program in which they funded for 
three years a development office in a number of 
seminaries — and a virtual miracle occurred. 
Nearly all the seminaries involved in the grant 
program earned back the cost in the first year of 
having a development person. And not only did 
contributions continue to grow, but an entirely 
new field in fundraising developed as people 
began to prepare to become development pro-
fessionals for seminaries.

99
 Chapter 6: Creating a Winning Fundraising Plan
design the campaign, and then let impassioned volunteers do the actual fund-
raising work. Or work with a consultant on the development of your mission 
statement, the planning of a specific campaign, the feasibility of a campaign’s 
success, or the training of key fundraising members of your board and staff. 
Taking either of these actions can help you build the foundation you need to 
pursue a successful fundraising campaign.
 
People who have a passion for your mission must do the actual execution of 
the fundraising plan, or you’ll fall short of your goal and perhaps lose some 
good relationships in the process.
Using fundraising software
Fundraising software can help you organize your fundraising plan and donor 
lists and provide valuable reports and analyses of your results. Should you 
make the investment not only to buy the software but also to transfer all your 
data into it? The answer is yes, yes, yes!
First, the odds are you don’t have to reinvent the wheel here. You can import 
the donor lists you now keep in a spreadsheet or word processing program 
into most mainstream fundraising software programs. After you transfer your 
current data into such a program, here are the areas in which you can expect 
to reap benefits:
 
✓ Donor management, including cross-references among family members 
and co-workers
 
✓ Volunteer management, including scheduling and tracking of hours 
worked
 
✓ Membership management, including keeping track of renewal notices, 
membership cards, and more
 
✓ Pledge processing with cash-flow projections and delinquent notices
 
✓ Major-gift management, including tracking memorial gifts and generating 
automatic acknowledgements
 
✓ Direct mail, e-mail, and other campaigns, including helping you organize 
your lists, personalize communications, and weed out duplicates sent to 
the same address
Yes, you may have to spend some time inputting data into the software, you 
may have to spend some money purchasing the software, and you may have 
to spend some more time training volunteers and staff to use it. But, in the 
end, fundraising software helps your organization keep track of all the details 
more efficiently, and because your organization profits from keeping a record 
of its activities, the software, in turn, helps you develop and grow.

T
his part focuses on the donor — the most important 
person in your fundraising effort. Meet your donor 
and find out how your organization’s needs and your 
donor’s interests connect. Discover how to research 
everything from your donor’s interests to giving trends.
Don’t worry about asking for gifts — major or minor. 
When you really get to know your donor and establish a 
relationship based on trust, asking for that all-important 
donation feels like a natural part of your conversation. 
Even when your donor says no, you have the opportunity 
to turn that no into a yes down the road. This part shows 
you how to do so.

In This Chapter
▶ Identifying your stakeholders and types of donors
▶ Eliciting help from your board members to find potential donors
▶ Investigating prospective donors
▶ Creating an up-to-date donor information system
▶ Keeping donor research confidential
T
his chapter is all about the “who” in your fundraising plan. Your donors — 
whether they’re individual givers, couples, affinity groups, or even founda-
tions or corporations — all believe in the work you do and contribute to your 
cause. Cultivating relationships with your donors and starting new relation-
ships with people who are likely to catch the spark of your mission and involve 
themselves in your cause require a dedicated effort and a well-thought-out 
plan. And rest assured that your work — in good times and bad — is likely to 
be rewarded.
Finding Your Stakeholders
A stakeholder is anybody who has a stake in what you do. In other words, 
your work impacts your stakeholders in some positive way; the existence 
of your organization makes a difference to them. Your stakeholders are the 
people you want to research as possible donors (if they aren’t already); they 
may be board members, staff, volunteers, clients your agency serves, ven-
dors, or contributors to your cause.
Different agencies have different types of stakeholders, including the ones we 
describe in the following list. You may recognize some of your own donors in 
this list.

104
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ Your clients: Your clients are the beneficiaries of your services. Who 
can better understand how worthwhile your mission is than those who 
have experienced it firsthand? For example, the family of an Alzheimer’s 
patient who found a daytime caregiver and developed better coping 
skills through your organization is a potential contributor to your orga-
nization. The patient’s family members believe in your cause because 
they’ve had a personal connection with it, and, thus, they may be more 
than willing to give back to your cause in some way.
 
✓ Current and past donors: Current donors believe enough in what you 
do to donate their money and possibly their time, energy, and talents 
to your cause. Past donors gave to you in the past but, for whatever 
reason, may not be giving now. At some point, your cause inspired them 
to give, so it’s reasonable to expect that they will give again.
 
✓ Major donors: Your major donors give at a high level and are already 
aligned with your mission and your message. They have made the con-
nection between spark and action and already support you, perhaps 
with their time and effort as well as with their dollars. See Chapter 9 for 
more about major donors.
 
✓ Your staff: Your staff members are the champions of your cause. You 
know your staff members believe in the work they do because they 
commit a significant amount of time and energy to fulfilling your mis-
sion. Staff members are in the unique position of being able to see the 
results of what you do and have a sense of the continuing and far-
reaching possibilities of your organization. For example, staff members 
of a research think tank see the research being done, the people ben-
efiting from that knowledge, and the possibilities for the future. Staff 
members in an arts organization see increasing support for the arts, pro-
ductions of exciting programs, and strong and growing arts education 
programs. Your staff, who believes so strongly in the mission, makes up 
a logical potential donor pool for your organization.
 
✓ Your board: Your board members are the people who steer the course 
for your agency. So who should believe in the work you do more than 
them? Your board members care enough to commit their time, their 
effort, their vision, and often their professional and personal resources; 
they should also be giving financially.
 
 Chapter 5 talks about the importance of having a board committed to the 
cause and the need to get every board member to give. Foundations look 
for 100 percent board giving as one of the criteria for funding. But beyond 
that, having a board that includes all-giving members is a good example 
for all the other stakeholders, from staff to volunteers to clients.
 
✓ Your vendors: Your vendors provide your paper products, your payroll 
services, your software support, and many other products and services 
you need to keep your organization running. These businesses and 
individuals know something about what you do, the people you serve, 
and the people who work with you. For example, perhaps you buy used 
vans for a meal-delivery service from a particular van dealership. The 

105
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
dealership is probably glad to get your business and may make a good 
potential donor. The link your vendors have to your organization is a 
closer one than the link you’re trying to form with a new business you’re 
considering approaching, so put your vendors on your stakeholder list.
 
✓ Neighboring organizations: These organizations are people or groups in 
your community that benefit from the services you offer. Certainly you 
have agencies in your area that are glad you exist. If, for example, a local 
community theater works in tandem with a larger theater arts agency 
from time to time, the agency may be a good source of donations of 
money, costumes, or props.
Recognizing Your Bread and 
Butter: Individual Donors
Individual donors were responsible for 75 percent of all gifts given in 2008 — 
a whopping total of almost $230 billion. Gathering all those small donations 
can really add up: In fact, your individual donors’ gifts typically add up to 
more than any single large gift resulting from that grant, corporate sponsor-
ship, or other large donation you’ve been hoping for.
Nonprofit organizations with effective fundraising plans don’t stop when they 
get the $25 donation from Mr. Smith each year in the annual fund drive. They 
persist, first securing Mr. Smith’s gift for a repeat year and then upgrading that 
gift to a higher amount. Over time, Mr. Smith gets more involved with the orga-
nization and continues to give at a higher level. Ultimately, his involvement 
may lead to a high-level gift, such as a major gift, a lead gift in a capital cam-
paign, or a bequest for the organization’s endowment. What this means — to 
you (the effective fundraiser), to Mr. Smith, and to your organization — is that 
over time, through your invitation and gratitude and through Mr. Smith’s con-
tinuing interest and satisfaction, a trusting relationship develops between your 
organization and its donor. In this way, creating and honoring your relation-
ship with each donor is at the center of all the work you do for your organiza-
tion today and in the future.
The following sections help you understand the relationships that different 
potential donors have with your organization and how to use that knowledge 
to cultivate them as real donors.
Understanding donor levels
Donors come in all shapes and sizes, as well as in all giving levels. Your orga-
nization’s fundraising environment is comprised of the following four distinct 
levels of involvement:

106
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ Level One: People closest to the heart — and hopefully the passion — 
of your organization, including members of your board, your agency’s 
managers, and major givers
 
✓ Level Two: People who work with or are served by your organization, 
including volunteers, staff, general donors, members, patrons, and clients
 
✓ Level Three: People who may have given to your organization in the 
past but who aren’t active givers now
 
✓ Level Four: People in the general population who have interests compat-
ible with your mission but who, as yet, don’t know you exist
Identifying possible donors
When you identify potential donors, make a list of specific people who fit into 
each of the top three donor levels described in the preceding section. The 
following three steps show you how:
 
1. Identify by name those people involved with your organization at 
Level One.
 
2. List the names of your potential Level Two donors.
 
 If you have a small volunteer group or staff, you can list the individuals 
by name. Otherwise, you may want to write down only the volunteer 
leaders or names of volunteers who are highly active in your organiza-
tion. Make notes of any ideas that occur to you about people you think 
would be a good fit for a particular donor level. Similarly, if you have an 
inspiring idea about resources — online databases of potential donors, 
for example — make a note to follow up later.
 
3. List your Level Three prospective donors. Record the names of people 
you know have fallen off your organization’s active donor list.
After you have a list of possible donors, plug the names into your donor 
tracking system so you can follow up on them later (see the “Keeping Track 
of Your Donors and Their Contributions” section for more information about 
this tracking system).
 
Just because people stop giving doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve fallen out of 
their favor. They may be feeling the strain of the economic times. Or maybe 
they simply need a reminder of how much you appreciate them and their gifts. 
Perhaps they need a “We’ve missed you!” note. People who have given in the 
past are more likely to give than those who haven’t yet given to your organiza-
tion, so make the most of your existing resources to help build your list and 
keep it active. By making the effort to stay in touch, you preserve the donors’ 
connection with your organization and make it more likely that they will even-
tually give again.

107
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
Doing Business with Corporate Donors
Corporations normally give for one or more of the following four reasons:
 
✓ Because they think giving is part of being a good corporate citizen
 
✓ Because they want to support and align with the mission of their business
 
✓ Because your organization’s mission resonates with an individual in the 
company who champions your cause
 
✓ Because companies that are known for giving are considered better places 
to work by employees (For example, McDonald’s employees are proud of 
the way McDonald’s serves families through Ronald McDonald House.)
That being said, however, corporate donations aren’t likely to be a major 
portion of your overall fundraising campaign — especially in challenging 
economic times. According to Giving USA 2009, corporate giving in the United 
States totaled $14.5 billion in 2008, which is only 5 percent of total giving.
 
One additional but perhaps indirect benefit of soliciting corporate gifts is that 
you may attract company executives who turn out to be good personal givers. 
As individuals find out more about your organization, they may very naturally 
be drawn to contribute time, treasure, or talent.
There’s a lot more to working with corporate donors than what we pres-
ent here. Flip to Chapter 22 for details about approaching a corporation for 
donations.
Finding Foundations That Care
Foundation giving can be a great boon to your organization, but winning a major 
foundation grant is often a time-consuming and lengthy process. Do your home-
work so you don’t waste your time or the foundation’s by submitting a grant 
that doesn’t have a chance of succeeding. In other words, find good research 
sources that help you understand which foundation is likely to be a good match 
to your mission. (For the details of applying for grants, head to Chapter 11.)
The first step in your search for the right foundation is to get your hands on 
different foundations’ giving guidelines to see what types of organizations 
and programs they tend to fund. Find out whether your organization fits their 
guidelines. In addition, check out some of these resources for more founda-
tion knowledge:
 
✓ The Foundation Center: Find useful statistics, links, and even online ori-
entations about becoming a successful grant seeker (fdncenter.org).

108
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ Donors Forum of Chicago: Find useful information about the three types 
of foundations — independent, corporate, and operating — as well as 
links to various foundation directories (www.donorsforum.org).
 
✓ GuideStar: This online research site allows you to post information 
about your organization that donors or grant makers can browse to find 
matches to their mission. It also offers information about a huge range of 
private foundations. GuideStar’s Grant Explorer product helps you look 
at historical information on foundation funding (www.guidestar.org).
 
If you’re scouting foundations, you can get a foundation’s annual report 
simply by calling the foundation and requesting it. (You can also order most 
foundations’ annual reports online.) Foundations pay out a percentage of 
their holdings in contributions. You can find out how much and in which 
areas these foundations have given simply by asking (this information is 
available to the public).
Community foundations are another useful resource for you as you begin 
exploring fundraising channels. Not only is your local community foundation 
a place to find funds, but it’s also a repository of information about all the 
nonprofit organizations in your community.
Asking Your Board All 
the Right Questions
Luckily, all the work of identifying potential donors doesn’t fall on your 
shoulders. Your board is instrumental in helping to identify the people and 
resources that can make your organization grow. One way to help your board 
help you in advancing funding is to get them away from the daily tasks they 
do so they can brainstorm about donor research and support. You can hold 
an inexpensive off-site meeting to enable board members to let go of the 
operating expense hassles and focus on the long-term picture.
So what questions do you put to the board when you get their attention? You 
may have a list of your own, but as you explore areas in which you can find 
donors to give to your cause, don’t forget to address the two questions we 
pose in the following sections.
Where did you forget to expand 
your donor base?
As you think through your strategic plan, you probably discover some unmet 
needs you want to address. And if you choose to explore ways to address 

109
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
those newly discovered needs, your exploration of a new area may lead you 
to some more potential donors — which is one way to expand your general 
donor base.
The following questions can help you explore donor areas that your organiza-
tion may not have thought about yet:
 
✓ Do you have new members or subscribers coming in regularly?
 
✓ Is your group growing or stagnating?
 
✓ What areas of activity can your organization consider?
 
✓ Are any of your programs outdated or unnecessary?
 
✓ Have you identified new programs that would reach new populations?
 
✓ What’s the average age of your members? Do you need to implement 
strategies to reach a broader group of people?
For example, a symphony that plays primarily classical and pop music wants 
to expand its donor base. Its members are worried that its current series isn’t 
bringing in new patrons. The symphony needs to try something different, so 
its board members get together and ask the preceding six questions. Upon 
answering these questions, the board recognizes the need to reach a new 
group of people and decides to take the symphony out into the community and 
change the musical selections. The idea produces several new venues, includ-
ing a hugely successful program called Symphony on the Prairie, which brings 
the symphony out under the stars with audience members listening from their 
blankets or tables — complete with boxed dinners — in a natural amphitheater 
in the countryside. As the success of the idea grows, corporations realize the 
benefit of providing clients and families with a nice night out on the prairie, 
and as a result, the symphony gains a huge audience in the corporate market.
In the medical field, this idea of addressing unmet needs is beginning to 
emerge in helping people develop an organized, cost-effective means of man-
aging chronic illness. If your organization has served in a particular health-
care area, for example, you may be able to expand your services to include 
case management, transportation, or another medically related service that 
helps patients manage long-term treatment more effectively. By expanding 
your services, you also expand your donor base.
Whom did you forget to ask?
While adding new programs to bring new donors to your door is an excellent 
way to expand your donor base, you may be (and probably are) overlook-
ing potentially valuable donors who are as close as your boardroom table. 
To find these donors, remind your board members to think of friends, col-
leagues, and other contacts they have who may be interested in donating to 
your organization.

110
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
If your board is lukewarm about using its collective contacts, try a little experi-
ment. At the next board meeting, take a set of 3 x 5 cards, and five minutes 
before the meeting is adjourned, say, “I’m working on donor prospecting this 
week, and I’d appreciate it if before you left today, you’d list three peers or 
companies you think could be potential donors to our organization. And while 
you’re at it, put a check mark beside the people you’d like to suggest we inter-
view as possible board members for the future.”
Using Table 7-1, list the potential donors your board members come up 
with and add a few of your own, too. You can then find out more about 
the potential donors by talking to the board members who recommended 
them or doing your own sleuthing. Write the donor’s or company’s name 
in the Potential Donor column. In the Individual/Corporate column, write 
Individual or Corporate to indicate which one the donor represents. Write 
the contact’s name or how the potential donor is linked to your organiza-
tion in the Link/Contact column. In the Ability to Give column, write Y (Yes) 
or N (No) to indicate whether the potential donor has the financial means 
to give. Finally, write Y or N in the Links to Major Donors column to indicate 
whether the donor may be able to open the door to other people in posi-
tions of power or affluence.
 
The key to remember here is that you have at your disposal a number of 
people — in your organization or on your board — who are likely to know the 
answers to your questions about potential donors. You just need to ask the 
questions.

Take a look at the donor recognition list published in the annual report of an 
organization in your community that serves an audience similar to the one 
you serve. Notice the individual donors and giving levels as well as corporate 
sponsors and foundation gifts, and add any names to the lists you’re compil-
ing in the different donor levels.

111
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
Checking Out Potential Donors
Say your board comes up with some great names of potential donors for you 
to follow up on. What do you do next? Or maybe your board comes up with 
a list of duds. No one seems to have the type of resources you’re looking for. 
Now what? Because these two situations are very different from each other, 
we look at each one individually in the following sections.
Pursuing promising prospects
You have a list in front of you of 15 of the top givers in your city, with links 
through the board members who know them personally. Before you get too 
excited and march up to their front doors asking for major donations, you 
need to do some homework.
Your homework involves finding out personal, financial, and professional 
information about the donors before you meet them so you can strategize 
the relationships you hope to develop. Your strategy includes finding out 
what types of contribution the donors may be able to make to your organiza-
tion, what types of investments may appeal to them based on commitments 
they’ve made to other causes, and how you plan to approach the prospective 
donors when you meet them and when you ask for their commitments.
The most effective fundraising takes place between peers, which means that for 
the best results, the board member who identified Mrs. Van Buren as a good 
prospect should be the one to call on her. The board member is her link to 
the organization, he knows her, and he can say, “You know, Gladys, I’m on the 
board of this organization, and I’m really proud of what’s going on here. Would 
you like to come over for a tour of our facility? I’d like to show you around 
myself. And maybe we can have lunch together afterward, if you have the time.”
Clearly, Mrs. Van Buren’s relationship with the board member is a key com-
ponent in furthering her interest in your cause and in your organization. See 
Chapter 10 for more information about perfectly executing “the Ask.”
Finding the silver lining 
with unlikely prospects
Even if your board survey comes up dry — which may mean you don’t have 
the best mix of people on your board — you still have plenty of places to 
start to build your donor list and look for those high-level donors. And in the 
meantime, you can work on improving your board.

112
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
As you build your donor list with little or no help from your board, start by 
doing the following:
 
✓ Examine lists (public lists, that is) that similar organizations keep of 
their donors. For example, an art museum looks at the patron list pub-
lished by the symphony and vice versa.
 
✓ Keep an eye on your community. Take a look at your local paper and 
note the names of local philanthropists that crop up repeatedly in print. 
Likewise, keep an eye on national, international, and online news if your 
mission reaches farther than a local constituency. Watching, listening, 
and taking notes can help you discover potential resources you may 
miss if you don’t keep your fundraising eyes and ears open.
 
✓ Review the list of political donors. Political donations are a matter of 
public record; every political campaign committee must file its list of 
donors with the commission in their state. Somebody who gives $5,000 
to a political campaign may be willing to give to you, too — and you may 
be able to determine what a particular donor cares most about by under-
standing the key issues of the candidate’s platform he or she supports.
 
✓ Visit the places where people go to be seen. Certain places in your com-
munity are equated with a certain status. Perhaps one of the gathering 
places is a formal garden, an elegant historical inn, or an arts center. Visit 
these places and read the plaques on the walls; look at the named statues 
in the garden; pour over the portraits on the walls. This type of sleuthing 
can show you which families in your area have wealth — and are using it 
to further causes that capture their imaginations and their passions.
Researching the Internet Way
When it comes to trying to find new potential donors, one of your best 
research tools today is the Internet. It provides a huge amount of information 
that is easily searchable, and you can use it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
whereas your local library or chamber of commerce likely closes its doors 
every evening.
Here are some of the most useful tools and approaches to use when research-
ing online:
 
✓ Browse Web sites. Countless Web sites are available to help you build 
your donor list. For example, if you’re researching a potential corporate 
giver, you definitely need to visit the corporation’s Web site. You can 
also visit the site of your local community foundation to find the latest 
nonprofit news in your area, read about funding opportunities, and learn 
about other nonprofit organizations. Check out industry standards like 
the Foundation Center (www.foundationcenter.org) to find data, 
links, and articles to help you gather information and resources on 

113
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
fundraising. Visit discussion boards, foundation sites, and social net-
working sites like LinkedIn to find out more about potential donors.
 
 Bookmark your favorite sites, display history lists of sites you’ve visited 
recently, and use research tools to make your browsing experience easier.
 
✓ Use search engines. Search engines abound online, and they’re very 
useful tools. But not all search engines are created equal. Most (like 
Google and Yahoo!) are capable of providing quick, targeted results in 
response to search words, phrases, or questions; others (like ChaCha) 
include the best results from a variety of search engine results in addi-
tion to custom vetted information; and still others (like the new Microsoft 
Bing) provide a variety of related material like product reviews, mapping 
features, and more. When you search for information on a specific donor, 
you may be able to discover what the donor’s giving interests are, which 
organizations she supports, and what roles she serves on corporate or 
nonprofit boards. These pieces of information will be helpful to you as you 
determine whether your mission is a likely fit for this particular donor.
 
✓ Locate people online. Donor research means finding out information 
about people, and, lucky for you, the Internet provides great resources 
for doing just that. You can browse white pages for just about every 
town online. You can also browse corporate sites that list board mem-
bers or senior managers by name or search for news about potential 
donors to find their current organizational affiliations.
 
✓ Explore government Web sites. Government sites offer free information 
about trends in the economy that may have an impact on future giving 
and regulations, tax benefits of giving, and more — all of which are 
important to know as you approach potential donors. As you plan your 
fundraising strategy, you may find the following government sites useful:
 
• IRS (www.irs.gov)
 
• Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (www.cfda.gov)
 
• Combined Federal Campaign (www.opm.gov/cfc)
 
• USA.gov for Nonprofits (www.usa.gov/Business/Nonprofit.
shtml)
 
 Also check out specific agencies related to your mission, such as the 
Administration on Aging or the Administration for Children and Families.
Keeping Track of Your Donors 
and Their Contributions
After you identify and research new donors, how do you keep track of all the 
information you accumulate? You need a system that’s comprehensive enough 
to store all kinds of data from multiple meetings — because you’re going to 

114
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
be meeting with potential high-level givers more than once or twice — and to 
essentially track an entire relationship. Such a system requires a lot of time 
and planning. We walk you through the how-tos in the following sections.
Creating an effective donor 
information form
A donor information form, whether on paper or in the computer, gives you a 
place to keep all of a donor’s data as you research and find out more about 
the donor. The following list outlines the most important categories of infor-
mation you need to include on your forms and in your database records:
 
✓ Administrative data: The date the form or record is created, the name 
of the person who created it, and the way in which the donor was 
referred to you (board member, other donor, friend, mailing, event, and 
so on).
 
✓ Name and address: The first, middle, and last name of the donor, the 
donor’s title, and the donor’s contact information, including residential 
and business addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. If your 
donor is a business or foundation, include pertinent information about 
the organization in general and also the name of and information for 
your contact within the company.
 
✓ Interests and business affiliations: The donor’s professional position 
and memberships, foundation or philanthropic interests, awards and 
honors, key relationships, special interests, and political, religious, and 
military affiliations.
 
✓ Education: The individual donor’s educational background, details of 
any continuing relationship the donor has with an educational institu-
tion, and social or business activities that tie the individual or organiza-
tion to education.
 
✓ Family: The name of the individual donor’s spouse, children, parents, 
and pets, including any significant or relevant information such as birth-
days, anniversaries, or hobbies.
 
✓ Resources: The names of the donor’s bank, financial planner, tax advi-
sor, and attorney.
 
✓ Finances: Information on the donor’s income, assets, past contributions 
made, and so on.
 
✓ Gift record: A listing of all gifts the donor has pledged and made to your 
organization.
 
✓ Visitation record: A listing of all contacts made to the donor by you or a 
member of your development staff or board.

115
 Chapter 7: Getting the Lowdown on Your Donors
 
✓ Opt-in/Opt-out: Give your donors the option of opting in or opting out of 
your e-mail communications and note their preferences. When donors 
opt out of your online communications, be sure to honor their requests 
and remove them from your send lists for messages and e-newsletters.
 
✓ Comments: Any comments you have about interactions you have had 
with the donor or mailings he or she has received.
 
Make your donor form simple and effective. Plan for multiple pages, with the 
first page collecting quick-look items, like the donor’s most recent gift (date 
and amount) or the program she most likes to support. Make the form easy 
to follow and understand, and organize the categories of information in a logi-
cal fashion. Leave plenty of space for comments so you — or board members 
who contact the donor — can make notes about the visit or call. Include col-
umns for totaling gifts and pledges so you can see donation totals and dates 
at a glance.
 
In time and with some effort, you’ll have hundreds of donor information forms, 
and you’ll want to have easy access to them. Create a good storage system 
of binders (or folders on your computer) labeled clearly so you know which 
records are kept there (A–D, Corporate Donors, or whatever). Of course, long 
term you’ll want all of this data captured in your donor management software 
as well so you can use it in searches later. Try to stay on top of your data by 
entering information soon after you gather it. That way it won’t get buried on 
your desk.
Keeping good donor records
Keeping your donor records up to date and accurate is a vitally important 
part of a good fundraising system. Whether you use an online donor manage-
ment system or keep track of your data in a custom database or an Excel 
worksheet, be sure to track your data consistently. In general, make notes of 
all the interactions you have with your donors, summarizing what was said 
and done, what pledges and gifts were submitted, and what your next steps 
will be in cultivation.
Maintaining Confidence: The Issues and 
Ethics of Handling Personal Data
When you accumulate information on a person of high status in your commu-
nity, you have something other people want. People at dinner parties would 
love to hear about the net worth of Mrs. Van Buren. A con artist would be 
interested in knowing that you’re doing research on wealthy older people in 
your region.

116
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
Fight the temptation to disclose what you’re working on — and certainly 
respect the privacy of the people you’re preparing to approach. The informa-
tion you gather is meant to assist you in finding the right match — both for 
the donor and for your organization — nothing more. When you find the 
donor who shares your interest in an issue, who has the ability to give and the 
motivation to do so, it’s an equitable, honorable relationship. You help the 
donor make a difference in an area she cares about and she helps you further 
your work. Everybody wins.
 
Divulging information about the person you’re researching is bad business, 
bad fundraising, and bad news. Giving away personal information to the first 
person who asks for it destroys the respectful relationship that should be at 
the heart of any fundraising effort. It makes the donor nothing more than a 
mark you’re approaching to “hit up” for cash. And you certainly won’t keep 
that person as a donor; in fact, you may get a reputation for lack of discretion 
that scares away many other donors as well.
Here are a few other ethical reminders you need to keep in mind during every 
fundraising effort you take part in:
 
✓ Make sure your board knows and approves of your methods of donor 
research.
 
✓ Review the Donor Bill of Rights and Code of Ethics from the Association 
of Fund Raising Professionals to make sure your approach is ethical 
from the start.
 
✓ Carefully consider whether a donor would consent to the type of 
research you’re doing or would be outraged to find that such research 
was being done about her.
 
✓ Keep your computer (and all the information stored on it) secure. Don’t 
post lists on your Web site and don’t give access to your records to 
sharp computer hackers via the Internet — protect your computers with 
a firewall or other security software.
 
✓ If you’re in doubt about a research practice, check it out with your exec-
utive director or attorney.
If you leave your position at your current organization and go to work for a 
similar agency, can you take your donor information with you? The answer 
is simple. Whether you’re legally bound by a confidentiality or non-compete 
clause in your employment contract or not, information stays with your cur-
rent organization — no question.

Meeting Your Donor
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing the impact of a personal visit
▶ Getting acquainted with your donors before and during your first meeting
▶ Understanding the donor-agency relationship
▶ Knowing your donor’s context
▶ Building the donor relationship
F
undraising isn’t for the fainthearted, no matter what the economic cli-
mate may be. And you may never be more aware of the need for courage 
on the job than when you sit down with your donors for the first time. What 
should you do at your initial meetings with donors? Picture them in their 
underwear? Imagine successful outcomes to your meetings? Be careful to 
present just the right image? All of the above?
Smart fundraising isn’t a hit-em-fast endeavor. It’s about relationship build-
ing, which enables donors to grow continually closer to your mission and to 
help increasingly through their time, efforts, and gifts. This chapter shows 
you how to think about the motivations and potential hot buttons of the 
donors you meet face to face. Keep in mind that you won’t visit every donor 
personally, of course. For example, Uncle Joe, who sends you a $15 check 
every year for your annual fund, doesn’t expect you to appear on his door-
step to take him to lunch. But Mrs. Benefactor, who gave a special gift to a 
program fund last year, makes a good prospect for your endowment cam-
paign this year. As part of building a relationship with her, visits are expected 
and, hopefully, welcome. In this chapter, we help you focus on the quest of 
building positive, long-lasting relationships with your donors.
Evaluating the Importance of a Visit
Attentiveness and respect are two keys to building relationships in the world 
of donor cultivation. Mailings are fine, but you don’t draw donors closer to 
the mission of your agency or higher up on your giving chart by sending 
them mailing after mailing. Phone calls are more personal than mailings as 

118
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
long as you don’t construe them as telemarketing ploys — at least donors 
hear a warm voice and know they’re getting your personal attention — but, 
for a potentially major, long-term donor, plan to make regular face-to-face 
visits. After all, you have a shared interest — your organization and the work 
it does. Take your donor to lunch or visit her at home; bank on the fact that 
you’re nurturing a far-reaching and, hopefully, continuously rewarding 
relationship.
So when is the appropriate time to begin planning regular visits to a donor? 
Donors need special, personalized treatment at the special gifts level of 
giving and above. Your goal is to secure the commitment of donors whose 
philanthropic goals match those of your organization. The special gifts level 
of giving is the first indication that the donor is willing to make a serious 
commitment to your organization. When the donor gives you this first hint, 
it’s up to you to take the ball and run with it. To nurture this important rela-
tionship, you need to do more research, make a greater effort, spend more 
time, and create more opportunities for interaction with the donor.
 
Visits — and the time they take — let donors know that they’re important, 
their contributions matter, and you want them to be happy. Not to mention, 
they keep the door open so your relationship can grow.
Preparing to Meet Potential Donors
Some of your donors have probably been giving to your organization for 
years. Some likely started out as volunteers helping with your big annual 
event; others may have served on your board for a term or two. Over the 
years, you may have sent these long-term donors your quarterly newsletter 
and a few mail appeals — one for your annual fund and another for a special 
program fund. In general, you can observe the following characteristics about 
these long-term donors:
 
✓ They’re engaged with the mission of your organization.
 
✓ They have had enough of a good experience to keep coming back.
 
✓ They may have increased both their giving and their involvement over 
the last few years.
These long-term donors are your first candidates as you begin your research 
for major gift donors. Chances are that you come up with a number of 
donors’ names during this part of the process. As you evaluate the donor 
files, consider several key points:
 
✓ How many times have they already been contacted by your organization?
 
✓ What donations have they already given to your organization?

119
 Chapter 8: Meeting Your Donor
 
✓ What other affiliations do they have with other nonprofits in your 
community?
 
✓ What’s their potential for giving (that is, what can you deduce about 
their financial status)?
Fully armed with the answers to these important questions, you’re ready to 
contact each potential donor for a meeting.
To begin your personal contact with a potential major gift donor, you call her 
number. After she answers the phone, you say what you’ve rehearsed many 
times.
“Hi, Mrs. Donor,” you say. “This is Jamie from New Beginnings. I was 
going over our volunteer records and I see that you’ve been giving both 
time and money to our organization for three years now.”
Mrs. Donor takes a minute to process the information.
“Well, we’re glad to help,” she says. “We’ve really enjoyed our time 
there.”
As the call continues, you tell Mrs. Donor that you’d like to invite her and her 
husband to be your guests at lunch, so you can thank them for their involve-
ment and introduce them to new happenings at your agency. Mrs. Donor says 
she’ll talk to her husband about it and asks you to call back Monday. When 
you call back as requested, you and Mrs. Donor schedule the luncheon.
To make sure your first face-to-face meeting with Mrs. Donor (and all other 
prospective donors) goes as smoothly as possible, you need to think about 
the following:
 
✓ What you offer a donor who gives to your organization
 
✓ How charitable giving is really a win-win proposition
 
✓ What motivates donors to give
The following section helps you explore each of these issues in detail to help 
you prepare for your initial donor meetings.
Examining the Giving Relationship 
between the Donor and the Agency
Nonprofit organizations and agencies exist and thrive to help real people 
accomplish good works. Way back when, if someone in the community was 
ailing, you could rally the support that person needed right there in the 
neighborhood, in the church, and in the family. In today’s world, however, 

120
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
the needs are often great and complex, sometimes spreading around the 
globe, which is where nonprofit organizations like yours come in to play. 
Nonprofit organizations exist to help people help others — through giving 
money, time, effort, or material goods.
In exchange for everything your donors give to you, you and your organi-
zation offer something in return. The relationship between you and your 
donors isn’t a one-sided one in which the only dynamic is that the donor 
gives and the nonprofit takes. Both sides have tangibles and intangibles to 
offer and receive, with the intangibles probably being the more important. 
These important intangibles include the following:
 
✓ The donor feels like he’s making a difference, like he’s an appreciated, 
valued part of a select group.
 
✓ The organization feels the security of being able to count on the donor’s 
involvement and contribution year after year.
This equal exchange not only helps the organization grow; it also enables 
the donor to benefit from the relationship. The following sections show what 
both your organization and the donor get out of the relationship.
Showing donors the value of their gifts
When donors give to your organization, what do they get in return? Hopefully 
they see the effectiveness of their gifts and feel assured that their money 
is going where you said it would (through stories in your newsletters, Web 
sites, or other communications about the programs and services they sup-
port). You show your donors that you value them and their gifts by providing 
them with the following services:
 
✓ Providing financial information: When you help a donor find out about 
planned giving options, you educate him about the various estate and 
tax-planning opportunities available to him. By working with his finan-
cial advisor or tax attorney, you can assist in designing the right giving 
plan to meet the donor’s financial needs.
 
✓ Evaluating options: Your donor’s time is valuable. When you clearly 
and simply communicate the mission of your organization — in print, in 
person, or on the Web — you help your donor make informed choices 
about the charitable organizations he wants to support. You help your 
donor get informed and involved with an issue close to his heart by 
helping him evaluate all his giving options.
 
✓ Interacting and corresponding regularly: You need to regularly show 
donors where their money is going by inviting them in for a visit and 
enlisting their help, care, and vision in building the organization. As 

121
 Chapter 8: Meeting Your Donor
donors get involved in and gain appreciation for your organization, they 
become part of a bigger system working to solve the problems of the 
world at large.
 
✓ Being accountable: After you receive that first fundraising gift, you owe 
your donor accountability. Report on what effect the gift has had on 
your clients, what good has come of it, and how you plan to continue the 
growth in the future.
 
✓ Demonstrating the good that’s being done: When a donation leads to 
a good outcome — a person finds a good job or a family moves into an 
affordable home because of a particular donation — don’t miss out on 
the great opportunity to enable the people who received the services to 
say thanks to the donors in their own words. Ask the recipients of your 
services to write a personalized note to the donors, sharing what hap-
pened because of the donor’s generous gift. These personal notes enable 
donors to hear directly from recipients how their donations made a posi-
tive impact on the lives of others — and that’s powerful stuff.
Getting more than money from your donors
What do donors offer your organization? You’re probably thinking, “Money!” 
But that’s only partially right — and it’s not even the important part. 
Although your donors do show their involvement through financial contribu-
tions (we hope), the most important donation they make is the donation of 
their belief.
If donors didn’t believe in what you do or in your ability to carry out what 
you promise, they wouldn’t spend their time — much less their money — on 
you. The strength of the belief your donors have in you and your organiza-
tion may vary over time and circumstances, but it’s your job to keep that 
belief strong and the interest growing. In tough economic times, even though 
donations may dip for a period of time, you always have the ability to keep 
the belief and connection strong. So don’t make the mistake of thinking your 
donors offer you only money. Some of the critical intangibles your donors 
provide are
 
✓ Time in voluntary services: Volunteers provide an amazing amount of 
service in nonprofit organizations all over the globe. The dedication and 
sweat equity offered is a huge testament to their belief in your mission 
and their partnership in your cause.
 
✓ Material goods donated: Some donors may prefer to give your orga-
nization supplies, tickets to community events, or materials instead of 
monetary gifts; these material goods can be a great help for donations 
ranging from computer equipment to classroom supplies to vehicles and 
buildings.

122
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ Donations of services and resources: Other donors may want to provide 
in-kind donations that offer professional services or resources for free. 
You may be able to secure high-quality legal help, investment consulta-
tion, or human resources services through these kinds of donations.
 
✓ Goodwill in conversations with friends: Don’t underestimate the value 
of a respected member of your community having a positive experience 
with your organization. Your donor then shares the story with friends, 
who suddenly see your organization in a whole new light. This kind of 
trusted referral — from someone people look up to and trust — makes 
all the difference in how open they may be to developing a relationship 
with an organization they don’t know.
 
✓ Visibility for your organization: If you have a small organization and 
you’re in the beginning stages of building credibility and reputation, 
here’s a tip on how to build that credibility: Go for the Good Fundraising 
Seal of Approval. In your area, you probably have certain companies and 
donors who are known for their philanthropic interests. When one of 
these groups or individuals gives to a nonprofit organization, the rest of 
the community thinks, “Oh, I guess that organization has a pretty good 
thing going — otherwise Mrs. Endrow wouldn’t give to it!” Look for and 
identify where the Good Seals are in your area, and organize your fund-
raising efforts to secure a donation from one of these key people.
 
The tax benefit for your donors is something important to remember as you 
talk about the upsides of giving — for you and for them. Donors who itemize 
can take a tax deduction of up to 50 percent of their adjusted gross income. 
For those donors who make major gifts, that percentage can add up to a 
sizable deduction.
Checking out what motivates giving
Why do people give — and why don’t they? When we threw this question to 
a classroom full of fundraisers, they gave us some interesting responses, as 
you can see in Table 8-1.
Table 8-1 
Reasons for Giving . . . and Not Giving
Reasons to Give
Reasons to Not Give
They have an emotional response to a 
cause.
They weren’t asked.
They like the tax deductions.
They’re unhappy with the way the 
organization is handling finances.
They share a belief in the cause.
Their interests and priorities have 
changed.

123
 Chapter 8: Meeting Your Donor
Reasons to Give
Reasons to Not Give
The nonprofit’s image appeals to them.
Nobody said thank you the last time 
they gave.
The nonprofit’s marketing materials 
attract their attention.
They no longer have the resources 
to give.
They want a sense of belonging — joining 
something bigger than themselves.
They didn’t like the manner in which 
they were approached.
They want to give back to a cause that 
helped them or someone they care about.
They’re insecure about the 
organization.
They get good seats at a basketball game 
in return for their donation (personal gain).
The organization doesn’t have long-
term plans.
Their peers influence them.
They weren’t asked for the right 
amount.
They enjoy donating.
They aren’t motivated by the cause.
They have personal experience with the 
cause.
They haven’t been part of a culture 
of giving.
They want to give in memory of someone.
They have compassion fatigue.
They want to set an example.
They hope to pass on a legacy.
They like the honor that accompanies 
donating one’s time and treasures.
They have spiritual reasons (tithing) for 
giving.
They want to have a voice in the larger 
discourse.
They feel empathy for the cause and its 
benefactors.
They want to make a difference.
The right person asked them.
We didn’t list these reasons in any particular order. We want to show that, 
although you may hope people give to your organization because they 
believe in your mission, tax deductions, marketing, or image may play a 
bigger role in why a particular donor decides to give or not give.
If you think about how, when, and why you give to the charities you support, 
you may identify with one or more of the reasons in Table 8-1. People have 
all kinds of motivations for giving — some people-serving, some self-serving. 
As a fundraiser, you can’t judge givers’ motivations — the why is up to them. 
The what, how, when, and, hopefully, how much is what you need to focus on 
when your mission matches their motivation.

124
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
One of the reasons why people don’t give is compassion fatigue, as you can 
see in Table 8-1. So what is compassion fatigue? In recent years, the term 
compassion fatigue has been used to describe the situation in which the 
donor is bombarded and overloaded with calls for help. They’ve been asked 
by too many different causes, which spread them too thin, especially when 
they’re concerned about finances themselves.
 
As a fundraiser, be sensitive to any messages your donors give you that indi-
cate changes in their relationships with your organization. Be candid with 
your observations and ask them whether you can do anything to alleviate 
any concerns they have about supporting your organization. By inviting the 
donors to share their ideas and opinions, you may wind up strengthening the 
bond they have to your cause.
 
You may find it hard to believe that one of the major reasons why donors 
don’t give is because they’re never asked. But it’s true! Can you imagine visit-
ing with a donor, having several conversations, having lunch, and then not 
asking him to make a donation? Hopefully, not! But recognize that rejection is 
a universal fear, and people everywhere try to avoid it — fundraisers included. 
Often, fundraisers set up conversations to lead to asking for major gifts but 
then avoid the direct question at the last minute. Why? Because hinting for a 
gift (instead of asking directly) is safer when you anticipate a no. (See Chapter 
10 for how to ask for major gifts directly and sidestep the whole rejection 
issue at the same time.)
Considering Your Donor’s Context
In times of economic downturn — or worse, a recession like the one we lived 
through in 2009 — everybody swallows a little harder when it comes to writ-
ing the big checks. Families, businesses, and organizations all over the world 
feel the pressure, and philanthropy does indeed experience a dip in overall 
giving to charitable organizations.
However, the dip isn’t as big as you may think. Why not? In large part, 
because giving has less to do with money than it does with hope. People give 
because they care and because they want to contribute to improving other 
people’s lives — whether those improvements help families rebuild after a 
storm, finance a child’s education, make prescriptions affordable for seniors, 
protect the environment, or make a difference in any number of other causes.
That being said, however, considering your donor’s context as you prepare 
to ask for any gift is extremely important. Knowing how your donors may 
be feeling and thinking can help you communicate — in a way they can 
understand — why giving to your organization is a good idea, even in tough 
times. The following sections offer some insights into how your donors may 
be feeling during a slow economy.

125
 Chapter 8: Meeting Your Donor
 
Involve your board as you consider how your donors are responding to your 
current economy. What do your board members feel is realistic? Are some 
groups affected more than others? Brainstorm ways to keep the mission of 
your organization moving forward while considering your donors’ realities — 
and be sure to plan to incorporate these ideas in your communications with 
donors.
Engaging donors with limited 
means (for now)
During times of economic uncertainty, people who live paycheck to paycheck 
struggle to make ends meet, so they’re unlikely to feel comfortable giving a 
major gift to your organization, no matter how much they want to. A large 
portion of your giving population may fall in this group, and your younger 
givers may comprise a large percentage. Similarly, people on a fixed income, 
who may include baby boomers and senior citizens (see the later section for 
more about these folks), may also be cautious about giving right now. How 
can you reach out to this group of donors with limited means and encourage 
them to give, letting them know you value their involvement with your orga-
nization — whether they can give $5, $50, or $500?
We’ve figured out that if you ask the questions you struggle with and listen 
carefully, people will provide the answers you’re looking for. So, if you don’t 
know how to reach people with limited means in poor economic times, try 
doing a little focus study with some of your donors in this group, and say, 
“We’re in unchartered territory and we need your help. We know you love us 
because you came to this meeting (thanks!), and we’d love to hear how you 
think we should approach donors and present ourselves during these tough 
economic times.” And then listen! You’re likely to get a gold mine of informa-
tion about donor practices, language, and expectations. Be sure to incorpo-
rate your donors’ suggestions into your approaches, and send them a nice 
thank-you note when everything’s said and done.
 
In the short-term, providing flexible, easy ways for donors to give — and feel 
good about what they give no matter the amount — is key. You can stress 
your own need to raise funds for daily operations by translating what the 
donor’s small donation can provide (something a donor can readily identify 
with). For example, say something like “Your $10 donation buys three back-to-
school kits for second graders at PS 103.”
In the long-term, tell donors that you know the economy will improve and 
that people will feel comfortable giving once again at higher levels. Including 
this idea in your messaging not only lets your donors know that you’re 
adjusting to meet them where they are right now, but also sends a message 
of belief that things will get better soon (and lets donors know you’re count-
ing on them to increase their giving when they’re able to do so).

Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Connecting with affluent donors
The major drops in the stock market during the tough times of 2008 and 
2009 put everyone on edge — including your more affluent donors. The 
major givers in your group may not experience the same level of impact that 
other donors do during economic downturns, but all people with invest-
ments, homes, and futures watch the churning markets with trepidation and 
worry. The good news is that eventually a sense of solid recovery will spread 
throughout the economy, and even the investments that suffered a major 
drop will begin to climb again.
 
Your major donors aren’t insulated from feeling the stress of the downturn, 
but they do still have resources to contribute to your organization. If you have 
a donor capable of giving you a half-million dollars, she may still be able to 
make that kind of gift, despite the economy. Affluent donors still have a tax 
or giving plan in place, and they’re still looking for charitable organizations 
with a mission like yours. Don’t hold back on your plans to approach affluent 
donors — after all, they’re expecting you. Just be prepared to answer ques-
tions candidly about how secure your organization is, how you’ve been meet-
ing financial challenges thus far, and what your plans are for the future.
Meeting reluctant retirees on their level
Of all the groups in your donor list, the reluctant retiree is likely feeling the 
impact of economic downturn most of all. Unlike younger donors who are 
just starting out, retirees have often worked their whole lives to arrive at 
retirement, ready to relax and live on what may be limited means. They may 
have planned carefully, saved religiously, and invested wisely — only to see 
their retirement funds drain away over a few nightmarish months.
The long-term good news for the retiree is that their portfolios will recover, 
but chances are they’ll never feel as buoyant as they did before the recession 
hit. Because of the shock of the drop and the shifting of their expectations, 
the retiree becomes a cautious donor.
You may be able to meet baby boomers and seniors where they are by 
bargaining down for now, suggesting that they choose to give $50 a month 
instead of a larger lump sum. You can offer additional options to help secure 
the income your organization needs while affording the donor control by 
offering automatic deductions from the donor’s bank account. It’s easier, effi-
cient, and both your donor and your organization can budget for it.
 
Don’t underestimate the intrinsic need people have to help make the world a 
better place, no matter what their finances may say. Giving — even if it’s only 
a fraction of what they used to give — still makes people feel good and demon-
strates the reality that no matter how tight things may be financially, good is 
still getting done.

127
 Chapter 8: Meeting Your Donor
Cultivating the Initial Relationship
As you continue to talk and get to know your potential donor both person-
ally and financially, you build trust and discover where your shared ideals 
lie. If the situation is right, by the end of your first meeting with a donor, you 
should offer your donor the following ideas:
 
✓ You value the donor’s involvement with your organization.
 
✓ You want to involve the donor on a deeper level.
 
✓ You have ideas for helping the donor meet his estate goals and avoid 
excessive taxation.
 
✓ You want to write up a few ideas and meet with the donor to discuss 
them in the coming weeks.
At this point in your blossoming relationship with the donor, it’s important 
to keep the trust building. At the end of your first meeting, you want the 
donor to leave with a good feeling about you and his relationship with your 
organization. So avoid the following when you’re in this initial relationship-
building stage:
 
✓ Being vague about how the donor’s money is going to be used: 
Today’s donor, having grown up in an age of media exposés, is some-
what leery about how nonprofit organizations spend their contributions. 
Be forthcoming with your organization’s financial information — it 
speaks volumes about your credibility. And remember that even if you 
don’t want to reveal information about the sources of your income and 
how it’s used, you have to make this info (which appears on IRS Form 
990) available to the general public whenever it’s requested.
 
 Speak candidly about the value of contributions for the general support 
of your organization. Say something simple like, “We have to turn on 
the lights everyday and get gasoline for the truck.” Most people under-
stand that general support — the money that goes to keeping your doors 
open — may be the most important money you raise in tough times.
 
✓ Making assumptions: Making assumptions can lead to missed opportu-
nities, especially during down economies. For instance, if you assume 
that donors in their 30s aren’t interested in an estate-planning option, 
you may lose a major donor because you failed to give him a convincing 
reason to donate. For example, if your donor’s father died at age 45, the 
donor is likely to be sensitive to the issues involved with caring for one’s 
family long-term in the event of an untimely death. The key here is to 
listen, listen, listen to your donors, and let them lead you to the gift area 
that’s right for them.
 
✓ Being afraid to bargain down: When you’re at a point when you’re 
ready to ask for a specific gift, don’t be afraid to ask for a lesser amount 
if the donor rejects your initial amount. Generally speaking, most people 

128
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
are flattered that you considered them part of a group that could give 
the amount you requested, so no harm is done. If your donor says no to 
$10,000, don’t be afraid to say, “Would you be more comfortable with 
$7,500, given over three years?”
 
✓ Promising more than you can deliver: Some fundraisers get so focused 
on the goal that they promise the moon to a donor to secure a gift. If 
you’re one of those people, fight the temptation. Every interaction with 
your donor either builds credibility or detracts from it, and making 
promises you can’t possibly keep only hurts your organization in the 
long run.
 
✓ Forgetting to say thank you: How can something so simple be over-
looked? Easily — organizations often focus on receiving and not on 
giving. Recognizing your donors by saying thank you, sending cards, 
making phone calls, or planning a luncheon needs to comprise about 20 
percent of your fundraising time. Seems like too much time? Well, it isn’t 
if you recognize that your primary goal is building relationships with 
your donors, not raising money. Thank you are two of the best friend-
ship-building words in the English language, so don’t forget to use them.
One way to continue to cultivate your relationship with donors is to recog-
nize your donors for their contributions. A great way to do so is to get your 
donors together at a dinner or other social gathering. This type of event not 
only recognizes your donors’ contributions, but also strengthens their rela-
tionships with your organization.
One nonprofit organization we worked with held cocktail parties for people 
who gave $5,000 or more. The receptions were a way of saying thank you — 
and were very popular with the donors. During the evening, donors exchanged 
ideas and information about the organization, such as why they gave, how 
they became involved, and what they liked about their involvement, which 
made everybody feel good about what they were doing. Donors also often met 
people they admired in the community and felt affirmation for their giving 
choices, which increased their loyalty to the nonprofit organization. The inter-
nal message was, “Wow! I didn’t know Mr. Smith supported this organization. 
This must be a great place!”
 
If you decide to hold a donor recognition dinner, try getting a sponsor to 
underwrite the meal for you. You can have a box lunch or a formal fete 
brought in, rewarding your donors and giving visibility to your sponsor — 
and it won’t come out of your budget! Everybody wins!

Cultivating Major Givers
In This Chapter
▶ Thinking through major gifts with tomorrow in mind
▶ Determining your goals for major gifts — and meeting them
▶ Turning donors into major givers
▶ Recognizing your major donors
E
very donor who has given to your organization in the past, who gives 
today, or who will give tomorrow is important to the continuation of 
your mission. The donor who gives substantially to your organization — in 
terms of time, talent, or treasure — is one of your primary stakeholders and 
is close enough to your cause to care in a big way. This chapter takes a look 
at the special relationship you nurture with major givers, whether they’re 
already giving at a top level or you hope to help them increase their gifts 
over the years to come.
Cultivating relationships with major givers is both an art and a science — and 
doing so successfully requires honesty, respect, and an ongoing commitment 
to long-term benefits for both the giver and the receiver. This chapter helps 
you think through the process of cultivating major givers and helps you make 
sure you acknowledge their gifts and commitment appropriately.
Seeking a Major Gift Today for Tomorrow
Asking for a major gift when the economy is pitching and swaying is com-
pletely unrealistic, right?
Wrong.
In fact, no matter what the financial landscape looks like, major givers are 
a breed apart from all others. These demonstrated givers have a history of 
contributing to your organization, they believe in what you’re doing, and they 
have experience with the work you do and the people you serve. People you 
identify as potentially able to make major gifts have demonstrated an interest 

130
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
level high enough to give in a big way. It’s up to you to determine whether 
they also have the financial ability to make a large contribution, and then — 
here’s where the science comes in — you need to use the data you gather to 
come up with the right amount for which to ask.
 
According to the 2008 Bank of America Study of High Net-Worth Philanthropy, 
the wealthiest Americans give from a high sense of commitment to their local 
communities and tend to be very loyal to the organizations they support. 
Thus, even in challenging financial times, organizations can expect major 
givers to continue to support their favorite causes, in terms of both finances 
and volunteer hours.
Working with major gifts and planned-giving programs requires long-term 
cultivation because donors who eventually make a major gift or bequest do 
so only after establishing a trusting relationship with your organization. They 
get to know you over time, during which you answer all their questions, dem-
onstrate your mission, model good follow-through and ethical behavior, and 
show that you care. Gradually, the relationship moves closer to the point at 
which you can confidently — and comfortably — ask for a major gift.
 
When you encounter people who aren’t ready to give the major gift at a par-
ticular time, one way to encourage them to give something is to invite them 
to put your cause in their wills. The idea here is that even though the donors 
aren’t ready to write a big check at the moment, putting your organization in 
their wills gives them a way to contribute to your organization in the future. 
Many organizations that develop major endowments and big gifts do so in 
this way, over a period of years. Gradually, over time, these major gifts build a 
pipeline of giving.
Your donors can put your organization in their wills easily thanks to the 
codicil, a legal document that’s an amendment to a will, spelling out that a 
specific grant of money will be subtracted from the corpus of the estate. You 
can draft a codicil for interested donors to use and your donor can then pro-
vide you with a letter saying that the codicil has been completed. The letter 
enables you to count the contribution toward your organization’s funding 
without needing to have a copy of the donor’s will in hand.
Many years ago, John was one of the founding board members of the 
Wellness Community, a cancer support group in Indianapolis. An attorney 
who was handling a donor’s estate planning contacted John and explained 
that his client was looking for a place to make a gift where the organization 
put the gift in trust and the trust paid interest and earnings each year to the 
charity. At the end of 20 years, the corpus would go back to the heirs of the 
estate. After talking to John, the donor put one million dollars into a charita-
ble trust for the benefit of the Wellness Community, and the annual earnings 
sustained the organization during up and down times. The gift literally saved 
the Wellness Community during difficult times and ensured its long-term 
viability.

131
 Chapter 9: Cultivating Major Givers
Finding the Holy Grail of Fundraising — 
The Major Gift
So now that you’re fired up to begin cultivating major gifts no matter what 
the financial climate looks like, you may be wondering what qualifies as a 
major gift. Well, no matter how hard you look, you won’t find a hard-and-fast 
rule about what constitutes a major gift; a major gift in your organization may 
be completely different than a major gift in another organization. The follow-
ing sections show you how to plan for major gifts and build a relationship 
with those donors who may be willing to donate the big gifts you’re seeking.
 
Does your agency have a gift program that enables donors’ gifts to keep on 
giving? People want their money to be used for something good, something 
that creates change for the better. For this reason, scholarship programs, 
research for cures, and programs that battle the recognized ills of society 
(like poverty, drug abuse, and illiteracy) are good candidates for major gifts. 
Who wouldn’t want to be able to say, “I gave the money that led to a cure for 
multiple sclerosis?”
 
Soliciting major gifts for human services organizations can be challenging 
because human services are ongoing, dynamically changing services, which 
means a donor can’t always give a major gift and know exactly where it’s 
going to be used. For human services organizations, one successful area for 
major gifts is in the endowment area. In this case, the organization sets up an 
endowment fund to produce an ongoing source of funds, which guarantees 
that the service will continue for future generations. We cover endowments 
in Chapter 23.
Planning your way to major gifts
Although you may think — and logically so — that the best (and perhaps 
only) time to receive major gifts is when donors feel like giving them, real-
ize that a lot of planning on the part of the fundraiser goes into acquiring 
major gifts. For instance, fundraisers often plan to secure major gifts when 
they gear up for specific fundraising campaigns — and begin cultivating the 
relationship with the donor months, if not years, before they’re ready to ask 
for the donation. In fact, a major gift often serves as the very foundation of 
a campaign, ensuring the success of the campaign before the organization 
launches it completely. For example:
 
✓ You’re planning a capital campaign and you need to determine how 
many major gifts you need in each of several ranges to meet your goal. 
(Creating a giving pyramid can help you determine what you need to 
know. See Chapter 6 to find out how to create a giving pyramid.)

132
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ You’re starting a new scholarship program and you ask a board member 
to donate a major gift as a challenge grant to get other members to give.
 
✓ You’re building an endowment fund and you plan to use major gift strat-
egies and planned-giving opportunities to bring in the funds you need.
You can have a major giving program even if you’re a small organization just 
starting out because you need to cultivate low-level donors over time and 
grow them into major donors. The normal progression of fundraising is to 
bring the donor closer and closer to your cause over time, which also means 
increasing the amount of giving along the way. If you haven’t thought about 
your current giving program as leading to major gifts, get ready to explore a 
new and profitable area!
Reviving your pool of current donors
Before you begin targeting major gifts, make sure your donor list is current 
and active. Your organization already has a record of who has given major 
gifts to your organization in the past. Find this record and scour its content. 
Who has given in the past and is still active in the organization today? Who 
has given before but disappeared in recent years? Follow up with any cur-
rently inactive donors and try to find out why they stopped being active in 
your organization. Maybe personal contact from you is just what the donor 
needs to get reinvolved in your organization.
After you find the information on gifts made to your organization, make a list 
of all the major gifts your organization has received in the last three years. 
Then for each major gift, include information on what program the money 
was targeted for (if any), the amount given, the terms of the gift (paid in one 
year, over three years, and so on), and of course, the donor who gave the gift. 
How have these gifts been used? What activity have these donors had since 
they gave their gifts? With the proper attention, you can get these donors 
to continue to be active in your organization. Research shows that if your 
donors have given before — especially within the past 18 months — they 
will be likely to give again. Cygnus Applied Research reports that most major 
donors are interested in ensuring the sustainability of organizations they 
already support as opposed to supporting organizations that are unfamiliar 
to them.
 
Of course, unforeseen events and situations happen, and sometimes orga-
nizations fall out of favor with a donor for one reason or another. But being 
new to the fundraising position in your organization gives you a great excuse 
to reinitiate contact with all your donors. When you call a currently inactive 
donor, say something like, “Mrs. Williams, I’m the new development person 
at StreetReach. I can see that you were very active in 2006 and 2007, and your 
involvement really helped our organization. I’m calling to introduce myself, 
thank you for what you did with us in the past, and invite you back!”

133
 Chapter 9: Cultivating Major Givers
Targeting your major gifts
As we discuss in Chapter 6, one of the first steps in effective fundraising is to 
know what your dollar goal is. Are you trying to raise $30,000 or $3 million 
this year? If you plan to renovate your building, calculate the renovation cost. 
If you need money for a certain music outreach program, determine exactly 
how much you need. Before you make a solid plan for the how, when, where, 
and why of major gifts, you need to know the how much — as in how much 
money you need to raise to reach your program goals.
After you know your dollar goal, you can create a giving pyramid to help you 
determine the kind of major gifts you’re looking for and how many of them 
you need. (Check out Chapter 6 for how to create a giving pyramid.)
Keep in mind that your fundraising plan — and the giving pyramid — doesn’t 
include only major gifts. You need to have several different major gift levels, 
such as $10,000, $5,000, and $2,500, as well as categories for lesser gifts. Not 
every donor gives the same level of gift, of course, and some, given a choice 
and gentle encouragement, may give a much higher amount than you expected!
Cultivating donors who have a lot to give
After you determine how many major gifts you need to receive to reach your 
fundraising goal, you need to begin thinking about which donors can help get 
you there. Where can you find major donors? The possibilities are endless! 
Here are just a few of the places where you can begin your search:
 
✓ On your board
 
✓ In the ranks of your volunteer corps
 
✓ On your donor list
 
✓ On the boards of other similar organizations
 
✓ In the community — people making waves
 
✓ In the community — people making headlines
 
✓ In the community — people making money
 
By far, your best tool for finding major donors is your donor list, which is 
why maintaining an up-to-date list and using it regularly is so important. For 
instance, as you update your donor list, you add new information you have 
learned about your donors and see ways to make better use of the information 
you already have. As you review your list regularly, slice and dice it by search-
ing according to different criteria — age, interests, education, location — to 
look at it in a variety of ways. You may find donors “popping out at you” that 
you overlooked before.

134
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Cultivating major donors in seven steps
The folks who are most likely to give major gifts are those who are closest 
to your organization — stakeholders, clients, and board members who obvi-
ously share the mission of your organization. (Read more about donor levels 
in Chapter 7.) They care deeply about the cause and the furthering of your 
mission, and, because their passion is in line with your own, they’re going to 
be your highest-level donors.
But most major donors don’t start out being major donors. Often they grow 
closer to your organization over time, perhaps starting out by making a $25 
donation to your annual fund and then gradually moving closer to the heart 
of your organization, where they may give larger gifts to specific programs.
 
The donors who give at a low level today are your major givers of tomorrow, 
which means that cultivation — the art of enhancing and building the donor-
agency relationship — is not only good practice, it’s good business. Today’s 
$25 donor may be tomorrow’s $25,000 donor.
The process of involving a donor at ever-increasing levels of giving is a logi-
cal one and consists of the following steps:
 
1. Identify the donors you feel are good prospects for major gifts.
 
• Review your donor list and giving records.
 
• Talk to board members.
The major donor profile
If you’re not sure what your major donors will 
look like, consider the following common char-
acteristics that we find in our daily work:
 ✓ Major donors are usually already involved 
with your organization.
 ✓ Major donors are involved in a number of 
community activities in both for-profit and 
nonprofit worlds. (The best donor to solicit 
is one who has already given to something 
else.)
 ✓ Major donors often have high profiles in a 
community and feel they have a responsi-
bility to give back.
 ✓ Major donors often have already raised 
their families (in other words, they’re in 
their 50s and up) or haven’t had children.
 ✓ Major donors often have at least some 
college education.
 ✓ Major donors may have volunteered when 
they were young.
 ✓ Major donors typically itemize their tax 
returns.
 ✓ Major donors are often involved in religious 
organizations.

135
 Chapter 9: Cultivating Major Givers
 
• Research Marquis Who’s Who in America (www.marquiswhoswho.
com) in your area of involvement.
 
• Use other research methods as needed (see Chapter 7 for more 
about donor research).
 
 Make a sublist of your main list, showing only those prospects you want 
to follow up on as potential major givers. For example, you might use 
your donor management software to create a sublist of donors who have 
given to a specific program in the past or who have given at a particular 
giving level.
 
2. Research the prospective donors.
 
 As you do your homework on the individuals on your sublist, verify that 
their interests do, in fact, support the type of work your organization 
does. Get a sense of their giving interests, other philanthropic activities, 
likes and dislikes, preferences, and commitments.
 
3. Based on what you know about the donor, design a strategy for culti-
vating the relationship with him or her.
 
 What type of program and/or sponsorship opportunity may the donor 
be interested in? Would it be best to visit the donor in person, invite the 
donor out for a visit, or something else? How could a board member, 
volunteer, or supporter with a strong relationship to the donor support 
the cultivation strategy? The strategy you develop for each donor needs 
to be custom tailored to her needs, interests, and priorities.
 
4. Build, or cultivate, the relationship with the donor.
 
 Depending on the prospective donor, you may meet with her several 
times over a period of months or contact her via a number of means, 
such as a phone call, letter, or personal visit. Regardless of how you cul-
tivate your donor-agency relationships, schedule true solicitation calls 
only when you feel your donors are receptive. Be sure to acknowledge 
the donor’s past giving history and involvement through the process.
 
5. Ask the prospective donor for the gift (a process we call “the Ask,” 
which we explain in Chapter 10).
 
 After you’ve cultivated the relationship with the prospective donor, 
you’re in a position to ask for the major gift. Remember that you can’t 
just jump from Step 1 to Step 5. Even if your donor gives major gifts 
hand over fist, you need to build your relationship with that donor 
before the gift is offered and continue to do so after you receive the gift.
 
 A delayed gift doesn’t necessarily mean no gift. In shifting economic 
times, your major givers are likely to be paying close attention to the 
stock market as they consider the gifts they plan to make. A delay may 
mean that your donor is waiting for a better time to donate stock, which 
may appreciate in the future.

136
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
6. Express your thanks for the gift.
 
 After you receive the major gift (assuming your solicitation is success-
ful), expressing your thanks helps pave the way for a repeat gift at some 
point. Saying thank you graciously and remembering — and honoring — 
any promises you make to the donor allow you to cultivate the donor-
agency relationship even further. But if you neglect to express your 
thanks or otherwise overlook the generosity of the gift, the donor may 
feel unappreciated, or worse, taken advantage of — and you won’t see 
any repeat gifts from that donor in the months and years to come.
 
 Recognize every gift in a unique way appropriate to the gift. You need 
to honor each donor so that she knows you truly appreciate the gift 
and the patronage. This equal recognition is especially important when 
your donors know each other and are likely to compare your recogni-
tion efforts. Remember, though, that people in the major giver category 
don’t need another plaque. Something more personal, like a photo of the 
donor with a client or at the front door of the building she contributed 
to, will have more meaning and create a lasting memory.
 
7. Account for how the gift is used.
 
 What you do with the gift is as important to the donor as what you do 
to get the gift. After you secure any gift — but especially a major gift — 
it’s vitally important that you do with it what you said you would. The 
donor needs to see where her money goes, and you need to be willing to 
provide that information as soon as the donor requests it, if not before. 
Doing so goes a long way toward building the donor-agency relationship 
and may ensure that you get another gift.
 
Want to really impress your donors? Don’t wait for them to ask about what’s 
happening as a result of their gifts. Go to them and say, “I wanted to show you 
what your gifts are doing — look how happy these kids are!” Show the donors 
photos of the programs they’ve helped sponsor and let them see the fruits of 
their gifts. Donors love to see the outcomes of their philanthropy — and the 
sooner you can provide that information, the better.
Building a giving club
Although you may initially solicit major gifts for a particular program or cam-
paign you want to fund, you eventually need to incorporate a major giving 
program as part of your regular fundraising strategy. Colleges and universi-
ties have perfected the art of major giving programs by creating giving clubs, 
which serve a number of fundraising-related purposes. First, they inform 
your donors about the benefits they receive at each of the different giving 
levels. Second, they help donors feel a part of something while building a 
sense of identity for your organization. Third, they make it easy for you to 
show donors how they can “upgrade” to a higher level of giving in subse-
quent years. For example, as part of your alma mater’s giving club, when you 

137
 Chapter 9: Cultivating Major Givers
give a large gift, your school may affix your name to the new library, to the 
endowed chair of a particular department, to a scholarship fund, or to any 
number of other long-lasting recognition opportunities.
As a member of your organization’s fundraising team, you can begin a giving 
club by identifying the club levels you want to create, the names you want to 
assign to each level, and the benefits you want to offer the donors who give.

Recognizing Major Donors 
for Their Contributions
As we say repeatedly (and we can’t really say it enough), giving isn’t just an 
“I give, you get” transaction; it’s an equitable trade that benefits everyone 
involved. Your organization receives something, to be sure, but you give 

138
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
something, as well. What you give your donors may be intangible — the good 
feeling that comes from helping a cause they believe in, for example. Or the 
recognition you offer them may involve something like a thank-you note, call, 
or visit to say, “Your gift was very important to us.” In the following sections, 
we offer some ideas for acknowledging your donors’ contributions.
Meeting your donors’ expectations
What do major givers want to receive in return for their gifts? For one thing, 
they want personal contact with your organization. Personal relationships 
are especially important at the major giving level. Donors want to be sure you 
know who they are. They want to be recognized as higher-level participants 
than the donors who send in the $25 check once a year to your annual fund. 
The following list details some of the things major givers expect when they 
give a major gift:
 
✓ Confidence in the board: Your major givers are more interested in the 
makeup of your board than people who give at a lower level. They feel 
better about making sizeable contributions when they have confidence 
in the leadership and fiduciary responsibility of your organization, the 
chairman, the executive director, and other board members.
 
✓ The efficiency of the management: In addition to confidence in the 
board, major givers want some assurances that the organization is well 
run, efficient, and dedicated to fulfilling its mission. No one wants to 
donate a large sum of hard-earned money to an agency that may dry up 
and blow away next year.
 
✓ The credibility of your advisory board: Some organizations cultivate an 
honorary or advisory board to offer insight, perspective, and credibility 
to the board. Though these individuals don’t do much in the way of leg-
work, having their names on your letterhead can be impressive.
 
✓ Recognition: Some major givers — although not all — want recognition 
from your organization, from the community, and from their peers for 
their support of your organization. Part of your job as the fundraiser is 
finding the appropriate recognition that will be meaningful to your donors.
 
✓ Personal contact: We’ve already said this, but it’s important enough to 
say again — your major givers want to hear from you. Notes, calls, and 
visits all say to a donor, “You’re important to us and we want to keep 
you informed about what’s going on.” By giving at high levels, major 
givers make a significant commitment to you, and they most likely 
expect an equal commitment from your organization.
 
✓ Financial advice: Some major givers may want some professional assis-
tance before their gifts are complete — from their lawyers, financial 
planners, or a foundation executive. Have someone on your staff or 
board who can speak knowledgeably about planned-giving instruments 

139
 Chapter 9: Cultivating Major Givers
and tax issues complement, not replace, your major giver’s own finan-
cial counsel.
 
 Some community foundations are able to give donors tax and financial 
advice when they consider major gifts. Check your area to find out about 
workshops given by your local community foundation that may help 
train development staff and/or your board on tax and financial issues.
 
✓ A way to extend the gift: Often your major givers are business savvy 
and like the idea that their money goes even farther than a simple gift. 
For this reason, challenge grants are popular as major or lead gifts. (A 
challenge grant is a gift a giver gives to an organization that is contingent 
upon the organization raising a matching amount from other sources.) 
Your major givers may like the idea that the money they provide “starts 
something” and grows into two, three, or four times their initial gifts. 
(See Chapter 21 for more details about these gifts.)
 
✓ Family honor: Many families make major gifts not to secure recognition 
for themselves but to memorialize a family member who had an affinity 
for a particular group. Often these major gifts are made to endowment 
campaigns with the idea that the endowment then provides an invest-
ment so that the organization receives dividends to secure its existence 
in the future. In a recent creative recognition effort, a leading museum 
added a dinosaur exhibit, and the major donor contributing to the cam-
paign named the dinosaurs for her grandchildren. Think outside the box 
when you look for naming opportunities — your major givers will love 
what you come up with if the connection is right.
 
✓ Involvement in the community: Giving a major gift may put a donor 
in a new social group or in a new light in a particular social group. For 
example, if a family is new to an area and has an affinity for a certain 
cause, giving a major gift may help establish the family in that area as an 
advocate of the arts, human services, or some other cause.
 
✓ Immortality: Many major givers have the desire — and the means — to 
do something significant, to leave the world a better place than they 
found it, to use their wealth to build a better future. If a donor’s name 
appears on the new library at his local university, he doesn’t have to 
worry too much about whether he has made his mark on the world. 
The feeling that you’ve changed the world for the better by being in it is 
something most people would like to experience at some point in their 
lives — your donors included.
 
Peer-to-peer contact is the best way to approach a major giver. For example, 
if Joe is the president of a local bank, prepare and send your board president, 
a company CEO, or a board member who is similar in professional and social 
standing. How exactly do you motivate the board member to do this kind of 
soliciting? Plan a board retreat that focuses on approaching major givers and 
helps board members get comfortable with their fundraising roles. For more 
on dealing with your board, see Chapter 5. For more about the nuts and bolts 
of asking for major gifts, see Chapter 10.

Providing donor recognition
Imagine that you’re about to receive a major gift. Mr. Smith listened to your 
presentation, liked your ideas, and is receptive to your suggestion that he 
donate $20,000 over the next three years. Now you’re back at your desk, 
soaking up your success. Enjoy the moment — for a moment. But then take 
the time to ask yourself, “Now what?” When you receive a major gift, or the 
promise of a major gift, you need to acknowledge the donor right away.
Providing recognition to your major giver is as important as all the steps 
you’ve taken leading up to the point of receiving the major gift. Remember 
that getting major gifts is about building relationships. So by receiving Mr. 
Smith’s $20,000 gift, you’ve agreed to accept and be accountable for Mr. 
Smith’s gift — and his involvement — over the next three years. In effect, 
you’ve said the following:
 
✓ “We value you — not just your money.”
 
✓ “We’ll use this donation wisely, as promised.”
 
✓ “We’ll be good stewards of this gift and be accountable to you for it.”
In addition to keeping the promises you make to your donor, you need to 
recognize your major givers in other ways, such as the following:
 
✓ Write a handwritten thank-you note on very nice stationery.
 
✓ Follow up by calling your donor.
 
✓ Make visits or have lunch with your donor periodically.
 
✓ Get your donor involved in high-level donor affairs, such as preview 
parties, soirees, grand openings, open houses, and so on.
 
✓ Assign the donor to a board position or committee seat.
 
✓ Name a program, a building, a garden, or an evening after the donor.
 
✓ Invite your donor to focus groups where you discuss the future of the 
organization.
 
✓ Send invitations to your donor for special events, such as seeing the 
birth of a baby elephant, going backstage to meet a violin virtuoso, or 
traveling with a select group to see a renowned speaker.
Sometimes finding enough unique naming opportunities for which to recog-
nize donors can be a challenge. One group we work with found a solution by 
naming items in their office area, such as the elevators, a meeting room, and 
so on, after particular donors. The only wrinkle here is figuring out what to do 
when the organization outgrows its current building and moves to a new office. 
If the office has no elevator, the development officer will have to come up with 
some creative alternatives to protect the agency’s relationship with that donor.

oes the title of this chapter put your stomach in knots and raise your 
blood pressure? If so, you’re not alone. It’s not unusual for people in 
fundraising, both experienced and new, to dread that oh-so-frightening one-
on-one conversation with the donor when it’s time for “the Ask.” When you’re 
going after a major gift, you eventually have to face the terrifying moment 
when you actually ask the donor for money. The stage is set. The spotlight 
is on you. Your tongue feels like it’s the size of Nebraska, and you hope 
the donor doesn’t notice that your hands are shaking. What’s worse is that 
you’re highly aware of the tumultuous economy and the impact it has had on 
almost everyone you know. Where on earth will you find the chutzpah to ask 
your donor for what your organization needs?
This chapter gives you a look at that terrifying moment and puts it in per-
spective with some basic management techniques for recognizing and 
responding to the challenges of asking for a major gift.
Pushing through the Fear by 
Focusing on the Greater Goal
The bad news is that sooner or later you have to push through your fear of 
asking people for money. The good news is that eventually “the Ask” gets 
easier, you get somewhat used to it, and being prepared, relaxed, and tuned 

142
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
in to your organization’s mission really helps. In this section we address 
some common qualms and explore ways to make you more at ease as you do 
“the Ask.”
Accepting that you have 
to talk about money
The fear of asking for money has numerous roots, many of which are com-
pletely understandable. First, money is still considered one of the big taboo 
subjects in society. You just don’t start asking personal questions about money 
in polite company. It’s none of your business how much one person makes as 
VP of his company or how much another has in her savings account . . . unless 
you happen to be raising funds for an organization that you (and potentially 
those two people) care deeply about.
No matter how you feel about asking for money, keep in mind that develop-
ing a fundraising system typically takes the work of many people for many 
months — it’s not a one-man show — which means you’re not the only one 
who has to face “the Ask.” And by the time you get to the point when you’re 
ready to ask a potential donor for a major gift, you’ll have done consider-
able legwork and research on that donor and his relationship with your 
organization, which means you’ll feel more comfortable and determined than 
you think when you finally reach the “Ask” (see Chapter 7 for more about 
researching your donors).
 
As you get ready to ask a donor for a major gift, keep in mind your organiza-
tion’s main goal (which is to further its mission in your community — not to 
get big bucks from rich folks). Remember also that you’ve laid the groundwork 
in your relationship with the donor up to this point, so chances are that he or 
she is anticipating the ask. Two tips to help you stay focused on the work at 
hand instead of getting blindsided by the money issue are:
 
✓ Remember what’s real. Money is an exchange mechanism, and you’re 
helping your donor participate in a charitable effort he cares about. 
Both your organization and the donor get something out of the donor’s 
major gift.
 
✓ Think about the other person. Devote yourself to helping the other 
person give, not to taking his money. If the donor is concerned about 
something, help him allay those concerns. If he doesn’t think it’s the right 
time for him to give, help him explore why and try to find out whether 
other giving options are possible. If you focus on the giving rather than 
the getting, you can focus on the donor instead of just money.
We talk more about perceptions of money and how to deal with them in the 
later section “Checking Out Your Attitudes about Money.”

 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
Understanding that no 
doesn’t equal failure
Another reason some people dread “the Ask” is because they have a fear of 
hearing no. For these people, perhaps no feels like a personal rejection or like 
the end of the line. Maybe no is one more nail in a fundraising campaign coffin.
Well, we’re here to turn all those ideas on their heads. No only means what 
you make it mean — and we suggest that when and if you do hear a no, you 
think of it as not yet instead. If you continue respecting your donor, honoring 
your relationship, and listening to what your donor does want to do for your 
organization, that no will likely bring you one step closer to an eventual yes. 
Keep these tips in mind:
 
✓ Go for a yes, but realize that you can live with a no. Expect that the 
donor wants to make the donation, but remind yourself that a no isn’t 
personal and has more to do with the circumstances and mindset of the 
donor than with anything you say or do.
 
✓ Turn a no into a not yet. The donor-agency relationship doesn’t end 
with a single no. The relationship you’ve taken the time to build will 
continue whether or not the donor makes this particular gift. Keeping 
this idea in mind can help you remember what’s important about what 
you’re doing — building relationships and matching the right people 
with the right causes at the right time.
Throughout this chapter, you find out how to listen to noes with a different ear 
and to recognize new possible outcomes of hearing no. You also find out when 
to bargain down and when to regroup. We ask you now to change your attitude 
that no is a word to be feared and to consider how a no can lead to a yes.
Can’t ask right now?
If you’re tempted to delay asking a major donor 
for a gift — even though you’ve been working 
up to it for weeks — because of the pitching 
economy, reconsider. As we mention in Chapter 
9, major donors are feeling the pinch like every-
body else, but they also have plans in place to 
help them weather the economic flows suc-
cessfully. Good times or bad, the major donor 
still has a giving plan in place and is still looking 
for organizations to support — your organization 
may as well be one of them.
Listen to your donor’s signals, of course, but 
don’t scrap your plan just because of the doom-
sayers on CNN. Go ahead and keep the appoint-
ment, work your plan, and hope for the best. 
Your donor will let you know if your request is 
outside the realm of possibility right now, and 
then you always have the option of bargaining 
down.

144
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Remembering that you’re a donor, too
 
A cardinal rule of fundraising is: You must be a giver yourself if you’re going 
to ask others for major gifts for your organization. Before awarding grants, 
foundations want to know that the board is a 100 percent giving board. Being 
a fellow donor carries a lot of weight for you and your organization, and even 
if donors never know whether you give (few people actually ask), you’ll be 
more comfortable knowing that you’re asking another person to do something 
you’re willing to do yourself.
 
Spending some time thinking about your own giving patterns can be a helpful 
way to prepare for meeting a major donor. John remembers his father coming 
home for dinner after volunteering at United Way. His father said, “I spent 
the whole day looking at budgets for nonprofit organizations. I never knew 
what all these different organizations did. And I decided maybe I ought to be a 
giver.” Having had that experience in his early childhood, John recognized the 
value of giving from his father, and that experience became one that built his 
own habit of giving throughout his life.
Keep in mind that your giving doesn’t have to be on the same level as the gift 
you’re asking for, although it helps enormously with major gifts. For example, 
if one CEO approaches another and says, “I’d like you to join me in being a 
member of the Chamber Society,” the message is that the asking CEO already 
gives at that high level and that the other CEO is being asked to donate at 
the same level. This comparison serves as a kind of endorsement for the 
prospective donor, and if the peer-to-peer relationship is such that the donor 
respects the asker, this endorsement sets up a natural yes.
So you can see that being a giver is an important part of requesting dona-
tions from a major giver, but should you ever divulge how much you give? 
Although the answer may vary from donor to donor, one subtle way to 
handle this issue is to have your organization’s giving levels ready to show 
the donor. You can say, “My wife and I give at this level, and I was hoping you 
would do the same,” while pointing out the appropriate category. That way 
no dollar amounts are named and the donor is invited to consider a specific 
amount. And, of course, you can always bargain down if you need to.
Checking Out Your Attitudes 
about Money
Before you can change your attitudes about money, you have to understand 
them. So what does money mean to you? Here’s a little true-or-false quiz that 
can help you see which attitudes about money are floating around in your 
head. Some of these attitudes may actually be stopping you from confidently 
asking for major gifts before you even pick up the phone to set up a visit.

145
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
True or False: Money is an 
exchange mechanism
True. Money provides a means of exchanging one thing for another. The 
money exchange goes something like this: “I trade what I do for society with 
what other people do for society.” Everyone has something valuable to give, 
and people today use money as the means of exchanging that valuable some-
thing. Although people have been debating alternatives to the current form 
of currency for some time, it beats carrying around a load of shells!
True or False: Money is 
the root of all evil
False. Money, being simply an exchange mechanism and not good or bad in 
itself, can’t be the root of anything. (And besides, the real quote is “The love 
of money is the root of all evil.”) People do bad things in the pursuit and pro-
tection of riches — you can’t blame money.
Believing money is the root of all evil no doubt influences the way you expect 
your donor to respond — so no wonder you’re afraid to ask! It’s time to 
change your attitude about money and to begin to see it as a simple means 
of transferring things of value from one person to another — in your case, 
from one person to your worthwhile cause.
True or False: Money can’t buy happiness
True. Money can’t buy happiness. Many people use this common saying 
when they don’t have quite as much money as they’d like and they feel that 
riches are just outside their grasp. “Oh well,” they sigh. “Money can’t buy 
happiness anyway.” Although this saying is true, don’t go to meet your donor 
with this outlook in your mind. If you do, you may be more likely to think 
something like, “Why is she giving to us, anyway? Is she trying to buy her 
way onto the board?” And these thoughts aren’t the positive ones you want 
to fill your head with as you approach “the Ask.”
Does it matter to you why your donor gives? It shouldn’t. You don’t 
want to accept a gift you know to be unethical or illegal, of course, but 
because donors give for so many different reasons — desire to help, self-
aggrandizement, recognition, status, and so on — it’s not your job to judge 
the giving that goes on. Focus on the good your organization does and resist 
the temptation to second-guess your donors’ motives.

146
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
True or False: Money talks
False. Money is an exchange mechanism, so unless you fold the check up and 
make a little puppet out of it, it isn’t going to talk.
But on some level, money truly can make things happen. In the 1980s, finan-
cial services company E. F. Hutton aired a commercial in which the narrator 
whispered, “When E. F. Hutton speaks, people listen.” The idea, of course, 
is that money carries with it a certain amount of power, clout, or prestige. 
People with money get things done — and that idea still holds true today, 
even in a topsy-turvy economy.
What do you think of the wealthy?
Just because you’re on the asking end of the 
fundraising equation doesn’t mean you’re not 
wealthy yourself. In fact, peer-to-peer fundrais-
ing, as you find out later in this chapter, is the 
most effective means of approaching a major 
donor for a donation. But exploring what you 
think of people who have more money than you 
do helps you expose and weed out any negative 
thoughts you have (jealous or otherwise) that 
may get in the way of effective asking.
You can expose your hidden wealth prejudices 
by finishing the following statement with what-
ever comes to mind:
“People with a lot of money are ____________.”
How do you fill in that blank? You may come up 
with any number of words:
 ✓ Controlling
 ✓ Happy
 ✓ In a position to help others
 ✓ Lucky
 ✓ Miserly
 ✓ Open hearted
 ✓ Powerful
 ✓ Power hungry
 ✓ Successful
 ✓ Talented
 ✓ Unhappy
Think about whether your responses are largely 
positive or negative; if they’re negative, change 
them. Perhaps you adopted your ideas as you 
were growing up (many of your money beliefs 
come from your early family experiences) or 
as you struggled over your own financial hur-
dles. But whatever the source of your feelings, 
recognize the ones that keep you from feeling 
strong, sure, and direct in your fundraising 
exchanges and get rid of them. Your fundraising 
abilities — and your relationships with major 
donors — will be better for it.
Sometimes donors may surprise you with 
candor and humor — and teach you something 
about fundraising at the same time. A promi-
nent philanthropist was recently honored by 
a local chapter of fundraising executives as 
Philanthropist of the Year. When he got up to 
receive the award, he said, “I bet a lot of you 
people thought we just bought this award.” He 
paused and looked around the room and then 
smiled. “And you’d be absolutely right,” he said.

147
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
As you consider your feelings and thoughts about money, we urge you to 
remember that money itself has no power. Individuals who have fortunes 
to manage may (and probably do) belong to certain clubs in town, frequent 
particular activities, and serve on selected boards. These people are real 
people — people with friends, people with problems, people with causes 
they care about and visions they’d like to see fulfilled. And these people, 
if their interests align with the mission of your organization, can be great 
potential donors — not because of the amount of power they wield, but 
because of the help, access, and perhaps endorsement they can bring to 
your mission. It’s the people, not the money, who bring the power to your 
organization.
 
If you’re worried about dealing with wealthier people, keep in mind that they 
respond well to businesslike reasons and sound arguments for spending their 
money on your cause. So prepare well for your pitch, make it professional, and 
don’t waste their time beating around the bush.
Figuring Out Who Should Ask for Money
Long before you go on that donor visit during which you intend to solicit a 
donation, you need to figure out who does the asking for your organization. 
Few things look more unprofessional than a fundraising team, standing on 
that proverbial doorstep, unsure about who’s doing what, which is why find-
ing and preparing the right person to do the asking is key in securing major 
gifts. The right person ideally
 
✓ Has a peer-to-peer relationship with the prospective donor
 
✓ Is a giver himself
 
✓ Is comfortable with fundraising
 
✓ Understands that the donor expects to be asked to give
 
✓ Is a people person, able and willing to focus on building relationships 
with donors over time
 
✓ Is forthcoming, honest, and willing to help donors resolve any questions 
or concerns that may be keeping them from giving
 
✓ Is confident and secure, unshaken by a no that could be a yes down 
the road
 
Perhaps the single biggest consideration in choosing the person who does 
“the Ask” is the peer-to-peer relationship. If you’re approaching the CEO of 
a corporation for a major gift, have your organization’s CEO or a person on 
your board who’s a peer in terms of social, economic, and professional status 
do “the Ask.” Similarly, if you’re approaching someone who has volunteered 

148
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
for the organization for a long time, send another volunteer — not a paid 
staff member — to do the asking. The similarity of the roles — whether those 
roles are professional, social, experiential, or professional — helps build a 
sense of trust between the donor and the fundraiser. People in unequal posi-
tions of power — a CEO and a paid staff member, for example — often have 
trouble reaching the comfort zone that people of like means or status share. 
And of course, whether the donor is asked by a peer or a staff member, an 
established relationship should already exist so the donor anticipates the 
coming question.
In the following sections, we explain how two people can work together to 
ask for a major gift, as well as what you should keep in mind if you’re doing 
“the Ask” on your own.
Teaming up for dollars
Some people prefer to work in fundraising teams, which are often comprised 
of a paid staff member and a board member. The board member is tradition-
ally the one doing “the Ask,” and the staff member goes along for support and 
encouragement.
The problem with the two-person approach is that some donors may feel 
“ganged up on” if they’re put in the minority. For this reason, you need to 
always be explicit about your intention to visit as a team: “Diana has a brief 
presentation she’d like to show you about our new waterworks. Would 2:30 
be a convenient time for us to come by?”
But, on the flip side, two people can be helpful in fundraising calls because
 
✓ They represent two different views of your organization.
 
✓ They give the donor a feeling that many people support the work.
 
✓ They’re more likely to cover all the key points, leaving nothing 
important out.
 
✓ If one person is having trouble establishing rapport with the donor, the 
other person may hit it off.
 
✓ The second person may bring additional ideas to the conversation.
 
✓ With two people listening to the donor, they’re more likely to hear the 
donor’s perspective and respond appropriately.
 
Practice makes perfect. Even though your board members may be CEOs and 
top-level community members, they can still use a brush up on fundraising 
skills. Before you begin an active campaign in which your board members 
are soliciting gifts (or accompanying you on donor visits), reserve time to do 
some role-playing. Be sure to reverse the role-play so the asker also gets to 

149
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
play the role of the donor. Have one member act as the potential donor and 
one member act as the fundraiser and then switch — don’t make it too easy, 
and have fun!
In the real world, all kinds of interruptions and roadblocks happen during 
fundraising calls, and the better prepared you and your board members 
are for them, the better the outcomes will be. With this idea in mind, in one 
of our role-playing sessions, we had the “donor” keep answering an invis-
ible phone on his invisible desk during the meeting. The “fundraiser” could 
barely get a sentence out without an interruption. In the meeting, we laughed, 
watching the “donor” frazzle the “fundraiser,” but we knew how helpful this 
practice could be for our fundraisers.
Flying solo
If you choose to go on your fundraising calls alone, you have a number of fac-
tors working in your favor:
 
✓ You’re the only one responsible for doing the preparation, which means 
nothing (hopefully) will fall through the cracks.
 
✓ You have a good chance (assuming a peer-to-peer relationship) of reach-
ing a comfort zone with the donor on a one-to-one basis.
 
✓ You won’t feel that anyone is looking over your shoulder.
 
✓ You can go with your instincts to direct the flow of the conversation.
But, on the other hand, the amount of responsibility you carry on a solo visit 
may be a bit heftier. For example:
 
✓ You have to be careful what you promise — no one checks and balances 
you but you.
 
✓ You can’t ask an informed third party how well you did in the call.
 
✓ You rely on your own facts and figures, with no one to back you up (so 
you’d better know your stuff!).
 
✓ If the donor call doesn’t go well, nobody can help you out of it but you.
Developing the Mechanics of Asking
After you investigate some of your attitudes about money and consider who’s 
the best person in your organization to do the asking, you’re ready to get 
down to the nuts and bolts of “the Ask.” This section takes you through the 
actual process and gives you tools to use along the way.

Recognizing the equitable exchange
Picture this: You have a pair of concert tickets you can’t use. You decide to 
call a few friends to see whether anyone else can use the tickets. You dial 
the phone happily, feeling that special “I have something great for you!” feel-
ing. The first two friends you call say they have other plans for the night, but 
they’re pleased that you thought of them; the third is thrilled and accepts 
the tickets gratefully. After the concert, she calls and tells you all about it (it 
was great, apparently), and she wants to take you to lunch to thank you for 
thinking of her. You didn’t get to go to the concert, but you did get to be part 
of an exchange that made another person happy, which can leave you with a 
pretty good feeling.
Why does your role in fundraising have to be any different than the situa-
tion with the concert tickets? Granted, you aren’t giving away concert tickets 
(unless, of course, you work for a symphony and are giving them to your 
high-level donors), but what you’re offering your donor is as important and 
as valued as a nice gift.
 
Fundraising isn’t just about getting money from people who have a surplus of 
it. It’s about matching caring people with the organizations that support the 
areas they care about, whether those areas are music, art, human services, 
education, civic affairs, or health.
Using the tools of the trade
Until the advent of the Internet and digital everything, the standard tools 
of the trade in fundraising involved a lot of costly, slick, four-color print 
brochures and annual reports. You may still have some professional leave-
behinds to give to your donor, but you may also take along a laptop with a 
PowerPoint presentation.
At the very least, you need to take the following items with you to any visit 
during which you plan to do “the Ask”:
 
✓ A card or brochure showing your giving levels
 
✓ A presentation (if you’re using your laptop), brochure, or report that 
tells the story of the difference you make (You can get more details 
about putting these materials together in Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Pledge cards
 
Taking a laptop to a presentation may be a hip and low-cost way to tell the 
story of your organization, but not all donors will like it. If you use the laptop 
to display the presentation, be sure to close the laptop and place it on the floor 
after you finish the presentation so that it isn’t an obstacle or a distraction 

151
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
between you and the donor while you’re chatting afterward. Also, be sure to 
rehearse your presentation in the office before you show it to your donor. 
Recovering from technical glitches and then moving to a successful ask is a 
huge challenge.
Knowing the donor
By the time you reach “the Ask,” you should know the donor well. Consider 
the answers to the following questions as part of the preparation for your 
donor visit:
 
✓ How long has the donor been giving to your organization?
 
✓ Why does she care about your cause?
 
✓ How much has she given in the past?
 
✓ How did her past donations help the clients who receive your services?
 
✓ What are her key interests?
 
✓ Which of your programs are aligned with her key interests?
 
✓ Have you prepared to ask for a donation in one of those key areas?
 
✓ How much are you asking her to contribute?
 
✓ What do you expect her concerns to be?
 
✓ How will you address those concerns?
 
✓ What recognition opportunity will be meaningful for the donor?
 
We can’t say this enough: The more you know before you ask, the better expe-
rience both you and your prospect will have, and the more likely your pros-
pect will be to see the match between your mission and her interests. Check 
out Chapters 7 and 8 for more about getting to know your donor.
Focus group for donors: “Why do you give?”
When you prepare for a major giving campaign, 
consider having a donor focus group to help 
you discover why people give to your organiza-
tion. You may already know the main reasons, 
but revisiting the question “Why do people give 
to your organization?” from time to time is worth 
your effort.
Get some of your active donors together — 
perhaps over a simple lunch. Ask, “Why do you 
give to our organization?” and keep track of the 
answers you get. Most likely, you’ll get a wide 
variety of reasons and you just may discover a 
thing or two about your organization — and the 
public’s view of your organization — that you 
didn’t know.

152
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Checking out each step of “the Ask”
You can break down almost every process — including the process of asking 
for a major gift — to a simple step-by-step procedure. The following steps 
can help you navigate the safe areas for conversation and comfort-building as 
you ask a potential donor for a major gift:
 
1. Open: 3–5 minutes
 
 You know about the introductions bit. As you’re walking into the meet-
ing, you and the donor both talk about the weather. You also mention 
how great the irises looked outside the conservatory this spring, which 
provides a segue into the next section of your conversation.
 
2. Engage: 5–20 minutes
 
 “Have you ever been out to see the gardens in full bloom?” you say.
 
 “No,” says the donor.
 
 “Oh, this year we included 14 new varieties of hybrids,” you continue, 
which enables you to spotlight a few of the things you did with the 
donor’s contributions to the Flower Fund last year.
 
 The point of this step is to truly engage the donor, to understand where 
she’s coming from, and to find out a bit more about her specific inter-
ests right now. The engage step enables you to see where her “hot but-
tons” are currently, even though you may already know what she cared 
about last year. For example, if she comments, “I’ll never give to that 
group again if they’re going to remodel their offices with my money!” — 
you know she’s not interested in funding renovations. You also uncover 
any new key interests that may help you see further how your organiza-
tion’s mission and her interests match.
 
 The most important three words to remember during this stage of the 
visit are “Ask and listen!” Know what questions you want to ask ahead 
of time so you can get a good sense of what the donor wants to know 
more about, what her concerns may be, and how you can resolve those 
concerns. Be aware of your history with this donor, but also keep your 
mind — and ears — open to hear new connections that may arise. But 
most importantly, use this step to listen carefully. Watch her face; read 
her body language; wait for the signs that she’s really excited about 
what she’s talking about. From that sensitive listening, you can begin 
to get a sense of which type of gift would most engage this particular 
donor’s imagination and interest.
 
3. Tell your story: 10–15 minutes
 
 Now you’re in the groove. You’ve set the stage, found out about her pri-
mary interests, and discovered the angle that gives you the best chance of 
appealing to her philanthropic interests. You now explain the program or 
campaign you’re here to talk about. You talk compellingly about the need 

153
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
(which the donor should empathize with), and explain how your program 
or organization serves that need in such a way that gets the donor inter-
ested in being involved. During this step, you rely on the information you 
brought with you, perhaps handing her brochures as you talk or showing 
her slides of the possibilities or programs you’re discussing.
 
 During this step, don’t do all the talking; it’s important to stay alert 
to clues from your donor that she has concerns or questions. Stop 
and answer any questions she has. Be forthcoming and consider each 
answer you give as a step toward bringing the donor into a better under-
standing of your organization.
 
4. Ask for involvement: 5–?? minutes
 
 In sales terms, this last stage is called the close. Fundraisers are often 
reluctant to use sales terminology (it isn’t a sales job, after all), but the 
result is the same: You need to ask the donor for a donation. Sooner or 
later, it comes down to that important question.
 
 You move right from your presentation to the close. “I can see that you’re 
interested in our visiting horticulturist program — I thought that you’d 
be one of the people most excited about this idea. We were hoping you 
would make a lead gift of $15,000 to start out this new program. And, 
with your permission, we would like to name the program after you and 
your husband, Joe, for all the important contributions you’ve made to the 
garden and to the community in the last 40 years. Is this amount some-
thing you’re comfortable with?”
 
 You’ve brought it to a yes or no response. If you get a no, don’t panic — 
you still have some things to do to try to turn that no into a yes (see the 
“Moving Beyond No” section for more details). If you get a yes, hand the 
donor an elegant pen with which to make out her check (or bring out 
that pledge card).
 
As hard as it may be to remember, this donor visit isn’t about you or your 
organization. It’s about your donor and how you can provide her the service 
of contributing to a cause she cares about, which means you need to fight the 
temptation to monopolize the conversation (something that’s very easy to do, 
especially if you’re feeling nervous). Instead, sit back and listen attentively. 
What is she really saying? What are her interests? How can you best serve 
her? You best represent your organization when you truly have the donor’s 
best interests at heart.
Moving Beyond No
Suppose that the worst happens and the donor says no. Chances are your 
donor isn’t going to say, “No! And get out!” but rather something a little less 
harsh, such as:

154
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ “Not right now.”
 
✓ “I’ll think about it.”
 
✓ “I need to talk to my financial advisor about it.”
 
✓ “I don’t think that’s something I’m prepared to do right now.”
The most important thing to remember at this point in “the Ask” is that, in 
fundraising, you will get all kinds of noes and partial noes, but you can’t just 
give up at this point and say, “Oh, okay. Well, thanks for your time.”
Instead, do a little investigating to discover the why behind the no. Here are 
some questions you can ask your donor:
 
✓ “Are you concerned about whether this is a good use of your money?” 
Perhaps the donor still has some unresolved concerns about your orga-
nization that you can clear up.
 
✓ “We were hoping you’d feel comfortable giving in the $10,000 to 
$15,000 range, but it’s most important that you give a gift you’re 
happy with. Would you like to divide that over three years, or make 
a smaller gift? We’d be grateful to receive anything you’re interested 
in donating to our organization.” Maybe the amount is too large for the 
donor to give in one gift. Don’t be afraid to bargain down.
 
✓ “Would another time be better?” Perhaps now’s the wrong time for the 
donor to give. If the donor offers a time that would be better for her, be 
sure to pencil in a time to meet again.
 
✓ “What can I do to help you say yes?” Whether you should ask this 
question depends on the personality and mindset of the donor. Some 
donors don’t shy away from saying no directly and may say with a wry 
smile, “Nothing today — sorry.” But others who are more hesitant to 
slam the door in your face may suggest something like, “Well, if I could 
be sure that the funds were going to go to. . . .” If a donor gives you that 
kind of response, you have something to work with in terms of further-
ing the relationship and getting closer to the point where he feels com-
fortable giving to your organization.
 
Is it ethical to mention other people in this donor’s social group who have 
given to your organization? Doing so may be ethical, but whether or not it’s a 
smart thing to do depends on the donor. Some people are put off by what they 
hear as “name dropping.” Others are encouraged when they hear that people 
they respect have given to your programs — as a result, those names serve as 
a kind of endorsement for your organization. Listen carefully to your donor, 
and if you gauge an interest in knowing who else has given, mention someone 
he may recognize and notice his response.

155
 Chapter 10: Asking for a Major Gift
Rating Your Yes-Ability
After you finish the call, do a quick assessment to see how you did. If you did 
“the Ask” on your own, think about your comfort level — and that of your 
donor — during the conversation. Take a look at your results. Where do 
things stand now? Did you get the gift? Did you get one step closer to the gift? 
Replay the conversation and notice where you did well and where you want 
to improve for next time.
If you have a partner for your fundraising call, you have a built-in evaluator. 
After you leave the donor, ask your partner, “How do you think we did?” 
Hopefully your partner will feel comfortable talking about the good — and 
not-so-good — parts of the visit. You can find out valuable information from 
the insights of another person who is at least partially objective. You may 
want to ask your partner the following questions:
 
✓ “Did we seem well prepared?”
 
✓ “Do you think we handled the question about last year’s shortage the 
right way?”
 
✓ “Do you think the donor felt comfortable with spreading the gift over 
three years?”
 
✓ “Did you notice anything you think we should work on?”
 
✓ “What aspect of the visit do you think we did best?”
After you complete the call, you need to document the information in the 
donor’s file. Write down the answers to the previous questions, as well 
as pertinent facts you need for fundraising calls in the future. Even if you 
received the Big Gift, you need to continue to build your relationship with 
that donor, as you see in the following section.
Dealing with the less-than-perfect call
Not all your calls will go the way you want 
them to. You’ll have an occasional meeting 
when somebody is put off by what you’re doing. 
Remember one important rule: “Don’t worry 
about it!” Then move on to your other pros-
pects. With the number of people you’re going 
to see and calls you’re going to make, a few of 
the calls may not go well.
If you remember the big picture — what your 
goals are — and know that a certain percent-
age of calls aren’t going to be perfect, you can 
deal with the ups and downs that come with 
the territory. You always have the continuing 
opportunity to build the relationship with the 
donor — even though the call flopped — and 
to get closer to that eventual yes.

156
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
Even if the meeting didn’t go as planned, still continue building the relation-
ship with the donor over the coming months. You may want to change the 
venue — meet for coffee instead of going to the house, for example — or, if 
necessary, consider sending somebody else to call on the donor. You don’t 
want to leave a bad taste in the donor’s mouth about you or your organiza-
tion, and replacing the difficult meeting with a better experience afterward 
creates a better memory all around.
Following Up after “the Ask”
Finally, the call is over. You’re driving back to your office with the nice feeling 
of having a $15,000 check for your organization in your briefcase. Mrs. Donor 
was very gracious and pleased that you approached her to give the lead gift 
for your new program. She likes the idea of the program being named after 
her family, and she wants to serve on the committee to help organize the 
kickoff event.
What are your responsibilities toward Mrs. Donor now that she’s given her gift? 
You’ll be faced with this ethical question over and over again in fundraising.
 
Donors are not just money sources. They’re people with interests and passions 
and troubles and fears. It’s not unusual to meet a major donor late in his life 
who has lost a spouse, and he may want to spend time talking, remembering, 
and visiting. When that donor writes you a major check, you have an obligation 
to show the donor that your relationship isn’t just about money. Here are just 
a few ways you can follow up with a donor after you receive a major gift:
 
✓ Send the all-important thank-you note.
 
✓ Make a follow-up phone call.
 
✓ Provide information on the new program as it develops.
 
✓ Send your organization’s newsletter or e-newsletter.
 
✓ Send invitations to all high-level social events.
 
✓ Set up occasional lunches or visits.
 
✓ Send invitations to participate in focus groups and/or special 
engagements.
 
✓ Send invitations to get involved in other organizational events the donor 
may be interested in.
As we say repeatedly in this chapter, “the Ask” doesn’t have to be a panic-
inducing event. Even if you don’t get the answer you want, you can make this 
process a positive contribution to building the relationship between you and 
the donor — which is likely to lead to a yes down the road.

T
he idea of getting a grant to help fund new initiatives, underwrite existing 
programs, or pay for special capacity-building opportunities is certainly 
something that should be on every fundraiser’s radar screen. That being 
said, however, grant funding is not a quick-fix kind of funding — it requires 
the research, dedication, and commitment to relationship building that you 
invest in your major donors.
In a down economy, grant funding fluctuates depending on the funds that dif-
ferent foundations have available. The Council on Foundations (www.cof.org) 
estimates that foundation endowments fell by 28 percent in 2008, a drop of $200 
billion dollars in the United States alone. What this statistic means for your grant 
proposal is that, to gain serious consideration from a particular foundation, 
you need to be both realistic in your grant expectations (because the grants 
given may be smaller than you hoped) and focused on demonstrating how your 
organization’s mission fits the foundation’s giving initiatives. For example, in a 
booming economy, when foundations have ample giving capacity, the programs 
funded may fit the foundation but may not demonstrate the highest overall 
attunement to the foundation’s goals. When funds get tight, however, only those 
programs that precisely match the foundation’s goals survive the cuts.
Are you discouraged yet? Don’t be — even in down economies, you can 
find funding from granting organizations all over the country. Just be sure 
to begin your grant search and proposal preparation with your feet on the 
ground. Your challenges will be in finding the right foundation to fund your 
program and articulating your mission as clearly and engagingly as possible 
so the foundation can clearly see you’re working toward the same goals. You 
also need to think carefully through each step of the grant proposal process. 
And that’s just what we help you do in this chapter.

Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Getting a Grip on Grants
At its most basic level, a grant is an award of money given to a charity or an 
individual. Nonprofit organizations receive grants for a variety of purposes: 
to start or run programs, to build buildings, and to build strategies. No 
matter what the purpose, all grants have a common theme — generally, a 
grant is freely given, which means you don’t have to repay it.
One exception to the free-grant theme comes in the form of program-related 
investments, which are actually loans that further the missions of nonprofits. 
Foundations treat program-related investments like any business investment 
and expect to be paid according to the terms established between them and 
their grantees, sometimes with interest. For example, a large foundation may 
fund a community organization designed to provide low-income housing. As 
the housing organization is paid for the housing it provides, the organization 
repays the foundation from which it received funds to provide the housing in 
the first place. To make a program-related investment a businesslike arrange-
ment, the foundation may charge interest (2 percent, for example, which is 
considerably below the standard rate). Charging interest isn’t mandatory for 
program-related investments, but some foundations feel that paying interest — 
even if minimal — is part of the discipline of repayment.
Identifying Different Grant Givers
Grants can come from a variety of sources. When you begin your grant 
research, think about which of the following sources may be most likely to 
“catch the spark” of your organization’s mission:
 
✓ Government agencies: These agencies comprise a large percentage of 
the sources available for grant seekers.
 
✓ Private foundations: These foundations award grants that are con-
sistent with their own mission and interests. Check your local philan-
thropic library for sources that provide information on current private 
foundations in your area.
 
 Be sure to check the Foundation Center Web site (http://foundation
center.org) for information related to private foundations.
 
✓ Corporate foundations: These foundations give grant awards to chari-
table organizations that seek funds in their areas of focus. The corporate 
foundation is often driven by employee interest and focuses on funding 
programs in areas where the corporation has a presence.
 
✓ Family foundations: These foundations are organized and managed by 
family members, a board of directors, or a trustee. They make grants in 
accordance with the mission of the family foundation.

159
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
 
✓ Community foundations: Community foundations, which make up the 
fastest growing group of foundations, are local foundations set up to 
make grants for community-serving programs and projects. This type 
of foundation is a special kind of foundation under the law, designed 
to be a place for people in the community to leave a lasting legacy. A 
community foundation’s first obligation is to its donors and then to the 
good of the community. It uses monetary donations either for the desig-
nated purpose that the donor requests or for the general improvement 
of the community. These foundations are trusted recipients of people’s 
legacies. The boards of community foundations tend to be staffed with 
people in the community who have a high moral sense.
Choosing the Right Project to Get Funded
What kinds of projects can you get funded through grants? Part of the answer 
to that question depends on the funder you approach. Different grant makers 
are open to different types of programs, which is one reason why you need 
to research your potential donors, including foundations, carefully before 
making that first contact. In the following sections, we list some general cat-
egories for which grant makers award grants.
Starting from the ground up: Seed money
Because everybody loves a great idea, getting seed money — the startup 
funding you need to launch a new program, extend your adult day-care pro-
gram, or host this year’s job fair — is probably the easiest type of funding to 
gain through grants.
As you begin to research and approach foundations, you may grow accus-
tomed to seeing the phrase no operating support, which means don’t even try 
to approach the foundation for funds to continue the good work you already 
do. Some foundations are exceptions to this rule, but most foundations don’t 
want to fund your day-to-day operating expenses.
Why are foundations unwilling to support the ongoing good work they’re will-
ing to fund at its startup? We have a number of possible responses to that 
question, but the predominant one is that foundations like to “see” the good 
they do — their purpose is to help you start a new successful program that 
will sustain itself down the road. For example, if you start a new program 
with a foundation’s grant funding, or if you create a new computer lab in your 
school with the grant award, the foundation can see exactly where its money 
went and get a positive sense of carrying out its own mission. Using grant 
funds to maintain an already-running program doesn’t give the foundation 
the same do-good sense.

160
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
Are you starting a new organization? The amount of startup funding you’re 
able to secure for operating expenses speaks volumes about your ability to 
create and sustain your mission. Do your best to have two years of operating 
funds before you open the door — doing so will be quite impressive to any 
grant maker you approach.
Expanding your reach: Program funds
Program funding may be slightly different from seed money in that you can 
often get a grant award to continue an existing program if you’re trying new 
things with that program. Mother’s Helper, for example, is a small nonprofit 
organization that helps teen mothers continue their education while learning 
about basic parenting skills. Mother’s Helper plans to add a mentoring com-
ponent to the program that will require additional volunteer solicitation and 
training, marketing costs, and so on. The development person who writes the 
grant proposal at Mother’s Helper needs to address this new component in 
her proposal.
 
Foundations look for the possibility of replication in the programs they fund. 
In other words, if a foundation funds your program, it wants to know whether 
your program “has legs.” Teach for America is one example of a nonprofit 
organization that replicated in a dramatic way, growing exponentially as it 
spread across the country. If the foundation you’re approaching for a grant 
can fund one program and watch the good spread to many places, it’s more 
likely to show an interest in your program and the possibilities it presents.
Grants: Just one piece of the fundraising puzzle
The hallmark of your fundraising program is its 
staying power, not its grant awards. Although 
your good ideas may touch many lives and 
improve conditions for your community, if you 
don’t address the economic factors that enable 
your organization to sustain itself over time, 
your mission will always be dependent on that 
One Big Grant to keep it alive another year.
Staying power is one of the best reasons for 
seeing your various fundraising efforts as 
an interrelated whole. If your donor base is 
strong, your donor list is up-to-date, and you’re 
continually cultivating major donors, and if you 
run a successful annual campaign every year, 
use your resources, and build relationships 
with individuals, corporations, and foundations, 
you can reap the income you need for operat-
ing expenses from the results of your healthy 
fundraising system. In that kind of fundraising 
system, grant awards can give you the working 
capital you need to be creative, to launch new 
programs, to try new things, and to build on the 
solid foundation of your other mission-related 
activities.

161
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
Building for the future: Capital campaigns
Capital campaigns fund new buildings, which makes capital funding another 
great way for funders to see the good their money does in a concrete way 
(pun intended). Capital campaigns enable funders (and donors and board 
members) to create something from nothing. From an idea, to a plan, to a 
model, to a reality, the capital campaign gives funders the opportunity to par-
ticipate in an organization in a big way by creating the future of the organiza-
tion and perhaps realizing an important naming opportunity for themselves.
 
Raising money for a building that’s already built is tough to do. Recently, a 
museum erected a new structure. The building was exquisite and the city 
was pleased with its new structure, but, when the organization began raising 
money to help pay for the already-built building, the general response was, 
“Well, you obviously didn’t need our money to build it!” Better to let people in 
on the opportunity to help with funding when the building is still a dream — 
then everyone can share in the excitement as the plans progress. You can 
attract a lot more investment and support — financial and otherwise — when 
you allow your donors to participate in the building process as it unfolds 
rather than when you go to them after the fact and ask them to pay for this 
really great building that you built without them. (For more info on capital 
campaigns, see Chapter 20.)
Laying the Groundwork 
for Grant Seeking
If you’ve never prepared a grant proposal, you have a wide-open — and 
exciting — field before you. If you (or your organization) have been apply-
ing for and receiving grants for many years, you have a track record you 
can review, revise, and reuse.
As you prepare to build a grant-seeking program either from the ground up 
or from an existing program, you need to consider several key ideas:
 
✓ Is your board ready to begin seeking grants?
 
✓ Do you have leadership in place to head up the grant-seeking effort?
 
✓ Have you thought through a strategy for grant submissions?
 
✓ Are you ready to administer grant monies and report back to the grantor 
on their use?

162
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Although applying for grants haphazardly is possible — and sometimes, by a 
fluke, profitable — your efforts pay off better when you develop a strategy for 
your grant seeking. You find out how to create a grant-seeking strategy and 
how it fits in with the grant application process in the following sections.
Turning to your board for support
Some nonprofits have huge boards with multiple subcommittees, a full devel-
opment staff, and an army of volunteers; other nonprofits have a small board, 
no paid staff, and few volunteers. If you’re a one-person development shop 
(whether you’re paid or unpaid), turn to your board to provide good leadership 
for your grant-seeking program (and your other fundraising functions, as well).
Even if you have few resources, your board leadership should be willing to 
help you (1) identify grant possibilities; (2) gather the information you need; 
(3) locate potential funders, opening doors when necessary; and (4) provide 
the input you need to complete the grant application and submit the proposal.
 
Having good leadership for your grant-seeking program is important for 
another reason, too: Any foundation thinking about funding your good work 
wants to see evidence that you have strong leadership from the board before 
it awards you any grant. Strong leadership often includes being able to report 
that 100 percent of your board gives financially to your organization.
Developing a grant proposal 
writing strategy
What should your grant-seeking strategy look like? Most importantly, the 
grant-seeking portion of your fundraising efforts needs to be only part of the 
strategic whole — not the sole object of your efforts. During different por-
tions of your year (depending on the time and people resources you have 
available), you need to focus on different aspects of funding. You must con-
tinue to contact and cultivate donors throughout the year, no matter how 
many other fundraising activities are going on. Although seeking grants is 
an important part of fundraising, it can never replace face-to-face visits and 
donor contact.
 
As you begin to plan your grant-seeking strategy, remember to use all the 
resources at your disposal. You can ask for help from your board, hire an 
outside grant proposal writer, take a class in grant proposal writing, and even 
use portions of grant proposals your organization has previously submitted 
(be sure to go over any recycled content thoroughly, though, to make sure it 
fits your needs today). Track your grant research in a database so you have a 
ready file of good foundational fits for grant possibilities in the future.

163
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
 
The grant-seeking strategy you create is just a general road map for your 
fundraising plan. Throughout the year, you may hear about new grants 
being offered by ABC or XYZ Foundation, and you don’t want to skip apply-
ing just because it doesn’t fall into the grant-seeking schedule you created! 
You need to take advantage of any grant possibilities that come to your 
attention — especially when they look like a good fit for your organization. 
As a general rule, though, planning time to focus on building your grant pro-
gram helps you concentrate your energies where they’re most effective. 
And even though your actual grant-seeking program may look very different 
from the ideal one you draft at the start, having a plan gives you something 
to get the ball rolling.
Looking at the grant process, step by step
Your board is ready to apply for grants, and you have the leadership and 
strategy in place. What’s next? First, you need to understand the basic pro-
cess of applying for a grant, which involves the following steps:
 
1. Identify a need for which you want grant funding.
 
2. Begin to develop the idea into grant proposal form.
 
3. Research grantors to see which ones support the type of issue you’re 
addressing. (See the “Finding the Right Funder” section later in this 
chapter for more on this step.)
 
4. Get current application guidelines from the proposed funder.
 
5. Write the grant proposal following those guidelines, and assemble all 
support materials.
 
6. Submit the grant.
 
7. Respond to any further requirements the grantor may have.
 
8. Get the grant award!
 
9. Submit any follow-up reports required by the foundation explaining 
how the monies were spent.
Hopefully, the grant process follows those steps. But you must remember 
that not every one of your grant proposals will be funded. Being denied fund-
ing doesn’t mean that (1) the funder is mean, (2) your proposal is bad, or 
(3) your cause isn’t worthy. Often, being denied funding simply means your 
proposal isn’t the right fit for the funder’s current focus. Or it’s too late in the 
year to receive funding. Or the proposal didn’t get to the right person . . . or 
any number of other things. So what do you do when you don’t get the grant? 
Turn to the “Putting a Positive Spin on No” section for the details.

Finding the Right Funder
Where do you find all the foundations that are willing to fund your great pro-
grams? Well, you look for them — at the store, online, at the library, at the 
theater, and in your local coffee shop.
Sound implausible? It’s not. We point you toward places you can look for 
grant opportunities in the following sections.
Starting your search for funders
As you begin to think about where to start your foundation research, remem-
ber the following tips:
 
✓ Keep your eyes open. You can find names of local and national founda-
tions on everything from special event invitations to raffle tickets. You 
can then research those foundations to see whether your programs fit 
their funding initiatives.
 
✓ Go to the library. If you can get to your local Foundation Center 
library, great! If you can’t, check out the Foundation Center online 
(www.foundationcenter.org). Either way, try to find foundations 
that make grants in your service area.
 
✓ Check out your local donor’s alliance group. Every state has a donor’s 
alliance group of some sort. Contact your local chamber of commerce 
to find out the name and number of the donor’s group nearest you, and 
then get to know more about the funding experiences of other nonprof-
its that are part of the group.
 
✓ Research related organizations. Find out who else does what you do on 
the national and local levels. What kind of grant funding do they receive, 
and from whom do they receive it?
 
The best place to start looking for funders is right at your own desk, carefully 
reading a copy of the newspaper — especially your local business journal — 
and visiting fundraising Web sites. From newspapers and Web sites, you can 
pick up on which local foundations are making grants and what types of proj-
ects they’re funding. And don’t just check these sources now and then — you 
need to keep your eyes on the changing nonprofit environment every day. By 
reading your local business journal or visiting your chamber of commerce’s 
Web site, you find out a lot about the exchange of money and influence in 
your city or town.
As you become aware of who funds what, you start to see names everywhere. 
For example, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation funds a 
number of public television programs. All you have to do is watch a local PBS 
station to hear the name of the foundation mentioned. Likewise, you hear 

165
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
about United Way agencies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funding 
programs all over the place. When you go to the zoo, you see names of high-
level donors, including some foundations, etched on plaques, drinking foun-
tains, and benches. When you go to the store, you may see Target or Walmart 
on information placards by the registers touting their corporate-giving pro-
grams. To find possible funders, all you have to do is open your eyes!
Zeroing in on your fundraising category
Imagine that you’re on the game show Jeopardy! and the following conversa-
tion transpires:
You say, “Categories for $100, Alex!”
“Answer . . . Where one would look for grants for a local theater,” 
says Alex.
“What is Arts and Humanities?” you exclaim!
“You got it!” says Alex.
When you begin using foundation and corporation reference books, you 
quickly realize that grants are awarded in different categories. This catego-
rization helps foundations control the types of grant proposals they receive 
and helps you determine how likely a given foundation is to fund your par-
ticular proposal. You find the following nonprofit categories on grant applica-
tion literature and foundation references:
 
✓ Arts and Humanities
 
✓ Civic and Public Affairs
 
✓ Education
 
✓ Health
 
✓ Religion
 
✓ Environment
 
✓ Science
 
✓ Social Services
 
✓ International
After you identify which category your organization belongs to (you may be 
able to be creative about fitting into more than one), you can search for the 
funders who grant awards in your category.
The preceding list isn’t the only way to categorize organizations. The 
National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) has devised a categorization 
system that includes 26 different groups under 10 broad categories. You can 

166
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
find this taxonomy on the Urban Institute’s National Center for Charitable 
Statistics Web site at nccs.urban.org/classification/NTEE.cfm.
Using local sources first
Although grant sources in your organization’s category abound all over the 
globe — and they do — your best bet is to start with those sources closest to 
home. Sources right in your area are more likely to fund you simply because 
you’re local. So how do you find the grant sources closest to your neck of the 
woods?
Start with the following local sources:
 
✓ Community foundations
 
✓ Local private foundations
 
✓ Organizations associated with the services you provide
 
✓ Local corporations and corporate foundations, especially those near the 
site where you provide service
A little bit of sleuthing can go a long way. Prepare to spend as much (or 
perhaps more) time educating yourself about your local funders as you do 
researching and writing your proposal. A good fit is half the battle: You can 
have the best-written, most exciting proposal in the world, but if you miss the 
deadline or submit it to a foundation that doesn’t support your type of mis-
sion, you’re going to come away empty handed.
 
Remember the importance of face-to-face meetings with major donors. 
Personal meetings can make a difference with foundations, as well. After 
you’ve researched a foundation and found a local funder that’s a good pos-
sibility for your program, find out whether the director is open to an in-person 
meeting. (Often the funder publishes in its grant guidelines or in the founda-
tion reference books whether it accepts a personal meeting as an inquiry 
method.) Relationship building is at the base of successful fundraising, and if 
you’re willing to build a relationship with your local funder, you may enhance 
your chances of getting that grant — if not today, then in the future.
Working your way away from home
What happens when you exhaust your local fundraising options? Suppose 
that you received a grant for $10,000 from the XYZ Foundation to provide 
seed money for a job-training program your organization is starting for teens. 
Congratulations! After you celebrate, you realize that you’re still $15,000 
short of your goal. What’s the next step in your grant-seeking plan? Use the 
XYZ grant to leverage other grants.

167
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
 
Getting any grant at all — regardless of the size or the source — is a seal of 
approval for other funders. The fact that you’ve secured funding is an encour-
aging sign to those who may consider funding you in the future because it 
shows that someone already thinks your organization is worth investing in.
The next step after you receive one grant is to research foundations and cor-
porations not found locally that are similar in mission to the foundation that 
has already awarded you a grant. Review your proposal, and revise it to men-
tion the money you’re getting from the local foundation. Then make a trip to 
your nearest library. Get your hands on a foundation reference book (see the 
list of resources in the “Resources for grant research” sidebar), and begin 
your search for foundations that are a good match for the program or project 
you seek to fund.
 
On the Foundation Center Web site (www.foundationcenter.org), you can 
search the Foundation Finder database to find good foundation matches. You 
pay a subscription fee, but depending on the types of grants you receive as a 
result, the price may be well worth paying.
Digging deeper to find the right grantor
Foundation and corporation reference books, as well as foundation Web 
sites, provide a wealth of information about the grant makers you want to 
investigate. But which pieces of information are important? What data should 
you pay the most attention to? As you dig deeper in your search for the right 
funder, find the following information about each corporation or foundation 
you’re considering as a potential funder:
 
✓ The types of programs the corporation or foundation funds: Many 
foundations support a wide range of program areas in varying degrees. 
Read carefully through the program priorities of the foundations

published by the Foundation Center as you

Culture

Officers and Donors

168
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
you’re researching. This information helps you determine which can-
didates are most likely to fund your particular project and which ones 
are the long shots.
 
✓ The average grant amount: The reference books list both a grant range 
(from smallest to largest) and an average grant amount. If you’re seek-
ing $120,000, you know you’re way off base when you’re considering 
approaching a foundation with a $35,000 average award.
 
✓ The number of grants awarded last year: Obviously, the greater the 
number of grants awarded, the better your chances of winning a grant. 
Numbers can be deceiving in this regard, though, because the founda-
tion probably also receives a greater number of proposals than smaller 
foundations, which means more competition for you. More important is 
how closely your program fits its mission and how clearly you make that 
connection.
 
✓ The time of year, or specific date, when the organization accepts pro-
posals: Different foundations have different proposal time frames, usu-
ally connected to when the staff or board discusses grant possibilities. 
Submit your proposal in plenty of time to make the deadline.
 
✓ The submission process the foundation or corporation wants you to 
follow: Some funders want letters of inquiry (see the next section for 
an explanation of these letters); others want full proposals; still others 
invite personal visits. Some funders won’t accept unsolicited proposals 
at all, so read each foundation’s listings carefully! If you don’t do exactly 
what the foundation requires you to do, even if it’s just attaching some 
supporting document, you may lose out on the grant on a technicality.
Inquiring about Letters of Inquiry 
and Grant Guidelines
Most foundations today want to see a letter of inquiry before they invite you 
to submit a grant proposal. What is a letter of inquiry, and what should you 
put in it? A letter of inquiry is a letter (okay, that part was obvious!) you write 
to the foundation providing an overview of your project and requesting the 
grant application and guidelines.
The letter of inquiry gives the funder a quick way to determine whether your 
proposal is in line with their funding goals. In essence, the funder wants 
a brief summary of your project or program, a sense of the grant amount 
you’re seeking, an understanding of the principal people in your organization, 
and a summary of how the program runs.
The grant guidelines, on the other hand, are for your benefit. They essen-
tially tell you how to prepare a grant proposal just the way the funder likes 

169
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
it, which is important information to have as you write your proposal. Grant 
guidelines provide the following specifics:
 
✓ The mission and focus of the foundation
 
✓ Eligibility requirements for grant seekers
 
✓ The process for how the foundation evaluates proposals
 
✓ A summary of which types of projects receive funding and which 
ones don’t
 
✓ Questions the funders want you to answer in your proposal
 
✓ Deadlines for proposal submission (including the schedule for grant 
awards)
 
✓ Contact and proposal submission information
 
✓ A list of the supporting materials the funder requires with your submis-
sion and in what format those materials need to be
Grant guidelines are an important road map for the grant proposal you’re 
preparing. Some grant guidelines are available on the Web; others you may 
need to request by calling or writing the foundation. No matter how you get 
the grant guidelines, be sure to take them seriously.
 
Many organizations today accept, or, in some cases, require, online submis-
sion of grant applications. Check the foundation’s Web site to determine its 
preference. Submitting online can sometimes be a lifesaver when you’re up 
against a tight deadline.
Getting Down to Business: 
Writing the Proposal
After you do your research and identify one or many potential funders, the 
next step is to write the grant proposal. Before you start groaning, think of it 
this way: Grant proposal writing is the art of passing the spark of your mis-
sion on to those funders who may be willing and able to help in a big way.
 
As you create each element of the grant proposal, use the most compelling 
information from your case statement so that your proposal demonstrates the 
following ideas to the funder:
 
✓ Your organization has an effective solution to a real need that the funder 
cares about.
 
✓ You have thought through the program carefully.
 
✓ You have planned out the process to implement it.

170
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ You have selected strong leadership for the program.
 
✓ You have been (and will continue to be) financially responsible with the 
program.
 
✓ You have a track record of accountability and will keep the funder 
informed of the program’s progress.
Although the proposals you write may vary depending on what the funder 
wants to see, a complete grant proposal usually includes the following 
elements:
 
✓ Cover letter
 
✓ Executive summary
 
✓ Introduction
 
✓ Program needs statement
 
✓ Program goals, objectives, and evaluation
 
✓ Program budget and budget narrative
 
✓ Leadership, staffing, and location information
 
✓ History of the organization
 
✓ Addendums such as your 501(c)(3) letter and financial statements
 
How long should your grant proposal be? Only as long as it takes to convey the 
problem, the solution, and the facts the funders need to make their decision 
whether or not to fund you. Let the grant guidelines give you an idea of what 
length the funder expects. Some foundations ask for brief (even one page!) 
proposals. Others leave the length open ended. Because you want to keep the 
funder reading, keep the proposal streamlined and interesting. Don’t restate 
on page 4 something you said on page 2. Tighten your words and lead the 
reviewer to the conclusion that you’re describing a program he’d like to fund.
Ready to start writing? The following sections explain each of the elements 
your grant proposal package needs to include, in the most engaging, clear 
style you can muster.
Creating a comprehensive cover letter
Your cover letter introduces your organization and explains to the funder 
what’s in the grant proposal package. The cover letter also includes any and 
all contact information you can provide for your organization, including e-mail 
addresses, your organization’s address, and a Web site, if you have one.

171
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
Providing an overview with 
the executive summary
The executive summary (also called the abstract) may be the single most impor-
tant section in your proposal. It should be short — one to two paragraphs — 
but complete. The executive summary gives a complete overview of your pro-
posal, telling the funder who you are, what need you’re trying to fill, how your 
organization plans to respond to that need, how the funder can help you effect 
that response, and how much money you need to do so.
 
Because of the volume of proposals foundations receive, the foundation often 
divides them among board members or staff to review, and the executive sum-
maries are the sections that speak to the overworked, time-crunched execu-
tives. Make your case clearly, compellingly, and concisely in your executive 
summary.
 
Ask a number of people both inside and outside your organization to read 
over your executive summary after you finish it. How could you improve it? 
Does it get to the point quickly enough? Does it say what you want to say? Use 
the reactions of your peers to streamline the summary so that it’s as effective 
as possible when it gets to the funder.
Introducing your idea
The introduction should also be brief, explaining a little more specifically 
what’s to come in the grant proposal. You can include a table of contents 
if you choose, although in shorter proposals, doing so is unnecessary. The 
introduction is a good place to tell the story of your organization or spotlight 
someone who has been helped by your services.

Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Stating your program’s needs
Your program needs statement paints the picture of the cause that your orga-
nization exists to support. The content for this statement can come right 
out of your case statement, if that document is up-to-date. You may want to 
tweak the information a bit, including specific examples of people who have 
been helped by your organization or situations that need your help, which 
can help the funder “connect the dots” between the need you’re describing 
and the real people you serve. When you explain your program’s needs, you 
also tie together the program you’re proposing and the potential funder’s 
funding criteria. The more you can connect what you need with the funder’s 
mission, the better your chance is of obtaining that grant.
Outlining program goals, objectives, 
and evaluations
The focus of this section is showing your funders how you plan to be respon-
sible for the grant — through program goals, objectives, and evaluations. 
Here are the basic differences between these three concepts:
 
✓ Goal: Answers the question, “What do we want to accomplish?”
 
✓ Objective: Answers the question, “How will we accomplish that goal?”
 
✓ Evaluation: Answers the question, “How will we know that we’ve accom-
plished that goal?”
Foundations want to see what the outcomes are going to be before taking a 
chance on funding your organization. If you’re awarded this grant, can you 
show how you will demonstrate success? Will you increase your capacity to 
serve the homeless by 25 percent? Graduate a greater number of high school 
students? Showing foundations how you plan to be successful — and how 
you will recognize success when you achieve it — is a key part of this section 
of your grant proposal.
 
Often foundations give you some kind of idea about what they’d like to see 
in a grant proposal from you. Be sure to write directly to any suggestions or 
questions you receive, and be able to demonstrate whether your program is 
replicable. Also include quantitative measures to show the results of your pro-
gram’s efforts.

173
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
Detailing the program budget 
and budget narrative
As you may expect, any funder thinking about giving you money wants to 
know specifically what you plan to do with it. Your program budget needs to 
show that you’ve thought out all the budget issues related to the project, 
that you’ve tried other sources (or plan to), and that you’re willing to make 
investments yourself to make the program happen.
The budget narrative explains your budget numbers in broad but accurate 
terms. You don’t need to walk the reviewer through every nickel and dime 
(nor should you include every nickel and dime in your balance sheet — 
rounding to the nearest dollar will do). But you do need to explain where 
your major expenditures will be, how you’ve planned for them, whom you’ve 
approached for funding, and what results you anticipate. Be as clear and 
forthcoming as you can be, but expect questions.
 
Foundations often ask for clarification on various points in your proposal. 
Instead of being alarmed when you get the call, be excited: The fact that the 
funder is taking the time to call you to clarify a few points on your proposal 
means the funder is interested enough in your idea to pursue it further.
Explaining your leadership, 
staffing, and location
You need to tell the foundation about the leadership you’ve selected to run the 
program or project. This information is very important to the funder because 
having good leadership is as important as having a well-thought-out budget 
plan, and the funder wants to know that you have the people to put your pro-
gram into action. Include biographies and résumés of the key people — people 
in leadership roles and staff members — involved with the program, and be 
prepared to have them sit in on a site visit if the funder asks to meet with you 
face to face.
The location of the program or project gives the funder a good idea of what 
type of facility you have, which ties to the practicality and the thoroughness 
of your idea. For example, if you plan to increase teen participation in a par-
ticular program by 15 percent but you’re already up against the fire marshal’s 
limit for your small bungalow, the funder may question your plan. If, on the 
other hand, you have a nice facility with room to grow, the site will work to 
your advantage. Having an appropriate facility assures the funder that your 
program — and ultimately its money — will have a real impact on the need 
you so eloquently communicate.

174
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
Sharing your organization’s history
Some grant proposal books may tell you to lead your proposal with the his-
tory of your organization, and you certainly can do so in any case if you 
believe your organization’s history plays heavily to what you’re trying to 
communicate in your proposal. In most cases, however, the reader skips over 
what you did yesterday to find out what you’re doing today and planning to 
do tomorrow. History is important, but in a grant proposal, it’s probably not 
the most important thing you want to communicate to your potential funder. 
Because you have only a few minutes of the reviewer’s time, it’s better to 
lead with the strong stuff and include the history at the end.
 
Your organization’s history may include a long list of accomplishments and 
names of famous people who have aligned themselves with your mission, or 
it may be the simple story of a need and the people who address it. Make sure 
the examples of your accomplishments illustrate your ability to make a differ-
ence. Whatever your story is, remember to tell it with heart and spark.
Including the necessary extras
At the end of your proposal, you need to attach a copy of your 501(c)(3) 
letter from the IRS, at least one year of financial statements (certain funders 
may request more), and your organization’s budget for the current year (not 
just the program or project budget that you included in the proposal). Check 
the funder’s guidelines for any additional materials that you may need to 
include, such as sample marketing materials.
Following Up on Your Proposal
How long do you wait after you submit a proposal before you follow up with 
the funder? Until your fingernails are gone? Until you can’t stand the sus-
pense anymore?
Most funders give you an idea in their grant guidelines what to expect in 
terms of review time. If you’re uncertain, call the funder and ask how long 
you should wait before checking back. You may get a “don’t call us, we’ll call 
you” response, but in most cases, the administrative assistant gives you a 
workable time frame. After the review time period ends, make a brief call or 
send a short letter to the funder to follow up on your proposal. Just make 
sure you stay current with your contacts, documenting your calls and the 
funder’s responses. Most funders respond in a reasonable amount of time, 
and you’ll most likely be contacted with questions and/or visit possibilities if 
a funder is actively interested.

175
 Chapter 11: Writing Winning Grant Proposals
And besides, who has time to sit around and worry about a submitted pro-
posal? You have too many other fundraising duties to attend to! So, while you 
wait for a particular funder’s response, move on to the next potential funder 
on your plan.
Putting a Positive Spin on No
If you hear the word no the first time you submit a grant proposal, don’t lose 
hope. Remember that, in fundraising, each no takes you one step closer to 
a yes. Especially in times of economic hardship, the noes are likely to out-
number the yeses you receive. Some foundations may tell you they have “no 
money” for the program you want them to fund. You can use this bit of infor-
mation to gauge interest and discover ways to make your proposal better 
by asking the funder this question: “Would you have been likely to fund this 
program if times were better?”
Ultimately, a no can mean any number of the following:
 
✓ The funder has already funded many programs similar to yours 
this year.
 
✓ The funder has other priorities right now. For example, you may have 
submitted a grant for your arts organization, but the funder is currently 
focusing on educational issues.
 
✓ The funder didn’t understand your proposal.
Handling a site visit
Before giving a major grant, foundation repre-
sentatives may want to visit your organization 
in action to see what you do. The experience of 
seeing the need and the work firsthand is very 
telling — and often inspiring.
When a foundation contacts you and wants to 
make arrangements for a site visit, don’t panic. 
Simply do the following:
 ✓ Relax. The foundation isn’t coming to 
“check up” on you or debunk your great 
proposal. Instead, the grantors are inter-
ested in seeing with their own eyes how 
the work you do fits with their mission and 
goals.
 ✓ Plan. Think about what the grantors can 
participate in that would give them a taste 
for your mission. Think hands-on experi-
ence as opposed to presentation. Giving 
your grantors a chance to meet your cli-
ents, hang out with your teens, or hear your 
patrons talk about the difference your orga-
nization has made can have a bigger impact 
than showing them charts and figures over 
coffee.

176
Part II: Finding — and Winning Over — Donors 
 
✓ The timing isn’t right, and the funder may want to wait until you’re fur-
ther along in the development of your program.
 
✓ The funder doesn’t feel that your organization is at the right point in its 
growth to tackle the proposed undertaking.
 
✓ The funder isn’t the right one for your organization.
No isn’t the end of the world. Review your proposal to make sure it’s as 
strong as you can make it, and try the next candidate on your funder list.
 
If you’ve at all intrigued the foundation and have established some kind of 
rapport, going back a second time makes a lot of sense. If you’ve established a 
personal conversation with a foundation representative, you can continue to 
build on that relationship for future submissions.
Seeing Your Grant as a Relationship
Finally, remember that similar to the relationships you care about and cul-
tivate with major donors, the relationships you establish with foundations 
that may be good fits for your organization grow over time. Maintaining clear, 
respectful contact, sharing program changes and accomplishments, and 
keeping the lines of communication open for future possibilities may lead to 
funding down the road, even if the time isn’t right today.
When you do get a yes from a foundation, your relationship moves to the 
next level. Now you likely have more back-and-forth communication as you 
fulfill the reporting requirements for the grant. For example, you may be 
asked to submit quarterly reports to keep the funder informed about your 
progress on the new program their grant is helping to fund. You may also 
have to set up and plan for site visits from foundation representatives during 
the years of your funding.
When a foundation chooses to fund your mission, the investment is a state-
ment of belief and trust in your organization. Now it’s up to you to do what 
you said you would do. Take the time to make sure your reports and other 
communication methods demonstrate, over time, that the foundation’s deci-
sion to fund your organization was a good one.
 
Grant officers are very interested in programs that have the potential to go to 
scale. If you have a program that you feel can be extended to other locations, 
your grant officer may be willing to talk with you about other opportunities for 
funding and growth.

Part III
Telling Your 
Story and Building 
Your Brand

In this part . . .
Just a few short years ago, you likely communicated 
with your donors in a fairly traditional way: You deliv-
ered your message in person, on the phone, by letter, or 
in your annual report and related brochures, and your 
donors responded accordingly. Each of these approaches 
had merit in its own right, but today — with the Internet, 
social media, PDF files, presentations, and more — the 
story you tell about your mission can leap off the page 
and come to life right before your donors’ eyes.
This part of the book shows you how to bring your story 
to life and build brand identity, engagement, and inspira-
tion along the way — as cost-effectively as possible — all 
while keeping an eye on what works (so you can do more 
of it).

hink back to the last time you were contacted by a nonprofit organization 
you’d never heard of. Which medium did they use? A four-color mailed 
brochure? A letter? A banner ad on a Web page? A phone call?
The organization contacted you to tell you its story — did it use the right 
medium to reel you in, or were you put off by the way the organization 
approached you?
Now think of an organization that you’re familiar with. How does it communi-
cate with you? By e-mail? Phone? Twitter? Letter? All of the above?
Just like the many groups that have tried to get your attention over the years, 
your organization has a need to be heard and remembered — for the work 
you do, the people you serve, and the hope you represent. Before new or 
experienced donors can truly understand and engage in what you do, they 
need to hear and connect with your story. Your organization’s story brings 
your mission to life; it includes heart and passion; it testifies to your account-
ability and stewardship; and it builds trust with your donor. This chapter is 
all about planning how to tell your story to maximize your communications 
dollar and share the inspiration as far and wide as possible.

180
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
In this chapter, we also talk about ways to share your story through print and 
direct mail and by phone. The other chapters in this part look more closely 
at other communication approaches, including writing grant proposals and 
growing your presence online and in the media. The bottom line when you 
share your story is donor engagement — when your donors are inspired 
about what you’re doing, they naturally want to be part of your good work.
Thinking through Your 
Communications Strategy
Once upon a time (four or five years ago), much of nonprofit storytelling was 
done in print. Your annual report, case statement, and various brochures 
carried the weight of your story, introducing donors to the people, programs, 
and practical considerations of daily life at your organization. This story-
telling came with a high price tag — having your materials professionally 
designed and printed in four colors was a costly enterprise.
Today you have many ways to tell the story of your organization. Your tradi-
tional publications can take on new, electronic life in the form of download-
able files, e-newsletters, even Webinars, YouTube videos, and Twitter blurbs. 
This frees you from the cost and commitment print requires, and enables you 
to respond quickly in a way your donors are likely to see. Creating a com-
munications strategy that enables you to think through the different types 
of communications you want to send — and the format in which you want 
to send them — is an important part of controlling your communications 
budget and making sure you’re getting the best return on your messaging 
investment. Knowing how to target just the right donor groups for specific 
communications is an important part of your overall plan because it helps 
you make sure you’re sending the right pieces to the people most likely to 
respond to them.
Evaluating your communications costs
How much does your organization currently spend on communicating with 
donors? You may need to do a little research to come up with your prepara-
tion, printing, and postage costs from the previous fiscal year, but chances 
are you need the numbers for your budget anyway. Taking a look at the 
amount of money you spent to bring in additional dollars is a helpful way 
to determine which of your communications efforts pay for themselves and 
which ones don’t. Use the worksheet in Table 12-1 to put your numbers 
together.

Tracking your communications approaches in this way helps you think 
through the results you want for each category. You can also gather good 
data to show you how much the various methods cost you. Although the 
costs will vary among nonprofits and may be skewed depending on whether 
a simple e-mail message brings in a major gift (it’s possible!), the information 
you gather will help you find out more about which communications meth-
ods are most cost-effective and produce the best result for your organization.
Here are a few suggestions of calculations you could do to connect your 
efforts to their results:
 
✓ Divide the total of your communications costs by the total number of 
people reached to determine a per-person communications cost.
 
✓ After a certain period of time (perhaps three or six months), you can 
divide the cost of a campaign by the number of new donors the method 
brought to your organization. This will help you determine how much 
this approach costs to bring in each new donor.
 
✓ Determine whether each approach provides you with a good return on 
your investment in terms of reaching, retaining, and engaging donors.

182
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Considering your communications options
So what’s the best way for you to tell your story? The logical answer is which-
ever way grabs your donors’ attention. Depending on the age and interests of 
your donors — and the type of story your organization wants to tell — you 
may use any or all of the following means to communicate with your donors:
 
✓ Personal meetings: Face to face is still a great way to communicate if 
you have both the time and a willing donor. Although the cost of meet-
ing a donor in person may be low, you need to take some materials to 
leave behind (perhaps an annual report, a pledge card, or a brochure on 
the program you’re introducing).
 
✓ Print materials: You can print your annual report, brochures, pledge 
cards, and other materials to distribute to donors and the general public.
 
✓ Direct mail: You can use print pieces to solicit for your annual fund and 
special projects, and you can distribute those pieces through the mail.
 
✓ Telephone: For some people, a phone call is the next best thing to meet-
ing face to face — for others, it’s an interruption and an annoyance. If a 
telephone campaign is part of your communications strategy, make sure 
you honor your state’s do-not-call lists and follow the necessary steps to 
keep your donor’s irritation factor low. (We discuss do-not-call lists in 
the “Knowing your no-call responsibilities” section later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Social media: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and MySpace offer 
viable ways to connect with donors and keep them in touch with your 
mission. Chapter 14 shows you how to build your donor base using 
social networking.
 
✓ E-mail lists: Most organizations communicate with donors, prospects, 
board members, and constituents via e-mail. You can use e-mail to 
simply keep in touch with donors, to send out monthly e-newsletters, 
and much more. Chapter 15 is all about connecting with your donors 
through e-mail and e-newsletters.
 
✓ Web site: Use your Web site, which you most likely have already set up, 
to tell visitors about your mission, your programs and services, your 
board, and opportunities for involvement. Chapter 16 shows you how to 
maximize the use of your site.
 
✓ Downloadable files: You may make your annual report downloadable 
from your Web site. Additionally, you may offer volunteer forms, calen-
dars, and other important donor-related documents on your site. Offering 
all these documents in one place allows your donors to find out what they 
want to know about your organization with minimal work involved.

183
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
 
✓ Webinars and podcasts: If you want to get really sophisticated (and 
save beaucoup travel bucks), consider having your meetings online 
using Webinars. A Webinar is a Web-based seminar that enables you 
to show presentations, chat as a group, and share your desktop with 
others in real time. You can also use podcasts to communicate your 
messages and opportunities to your donors. A podcast is an audio or 
video recording of a meeting, seminar, or lecture that you make avail-
able for people to download to their MP3 players or computers. See 
Chapter 19 for the ins and outs of Webinars.
Each of these communications methods may have a place in your overall 
fundraising strategy. Which of these methods fit your donors best? And 
how often do you plan to use these approaches? The answers to these 
questions — and others — help you lay the foundation of your communica-
tions approach.
Crafting a communications approach
The idea of drafting a comprehensive communications plan that includes all 
your communication goals and objectives for the year may seem daunting, 
but taking the time to plot your communications strategy for the year is more 
than just a good idea. Looking specifically at the approaches you use to reach 
donors can help you determine how to best reach your donors in a low-cost 
and far-reaching way.
 
Begin by looking at a yearly calendar and plotting your major communications 
initiatives — your annual report, your fall and spring annual fund letters, and 
your spring fundraising event, for example. Create a month-by-month list of 
all those regular initiatives and determine which communications approaches 
may work best for your various donor contacts. Where can you trade print for 
e-mail? Where can you post something online instead of mailing a packet to a 
donor? You may be surprised by the money you can save when you get cre-
ative about the ways you share your story with your donors. Keeping your par-
ticular donors and the types of communications you send in mind is important.
For example, in considering your annual report, you may ask the following 
questions:
 
✓ Will we make this report available in print, online, or both?
 
✓ Will we offer the annual report as a presentation?
 
✓ Will we offer a Webinar or online meeting to introduce the report to 
key donors?
 
✓ Will we use e-mail to get the report to donors?

184
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
The list! The list! Pull out your donor list!
After you decide which type of communication to use to tell your story, you 
need to select who will receive your well-planned communications. Your 
donor list, containing all the donors in your database, is a vital part of your 
communications approach and it’s precisely where you need to start as you 
try to identify the who of your communications strategy.
Use your list to provide the names, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses 
for all the donors you contact in the various campaigns throughout the 
year. Your donor management software helps you collect information about 
donors, store ongoing information, produce targeted lists based on search 
criteria you enter (for example, all new donors in 2009), and produce subsets 
of the list that enable you to send communications to targeted groups. (We 
discuss donor management software and other ways to keep track of your 
donor information in Chapter 7.) For example, depending on what audience 
you want to reach, you may creatively slice and dice your list and send com-
munications to
 
✓ Volunteers who helped with special events last year
 
✓ Directors of nonprofit organizations
 
✓ Donors who give through a specific corporate giving program
 
✓ Donors in a particular area of your city
 
✓ All donors with pets
 
By figuring out how to slice and dice your list, you can also be more inten-
tional about the message you send out. For example, using your donor man-
agement software, you can create a list of all donors who haven’t yet given 
this year and send them a special e-mail message you compose just for them.
 
What happens when you do a particularly successful communications cam-
paign and one of your sister organizations wants to use your donor list? Is 
sharing your donor information with other organizations ethical? Will doing 
so make your donors unhappy? This situation is when the opt-in/opt-out ques-
tion on your donor information form comes in handy (see Chapter 7). You can 
share the contact information for those donors who indicate it’s okay to do so.
Printing Only What You Need
Although many on-a-shoestring nonprofits put printing designer-made annual 
reports, color brochures, and engraved letterheads at the very bottom of 
their priority lists, you can still publish less costly print pieces now and save 
printing the fancy stuff for a time when you can more easily afford it. After 
all, some print pieces play such an important role in your communications 

185
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
approach that you can’t afford not to print them — even when you’re on a 
tight budget. Here are the major must-have print pieces:
 
✓ One- or two-color brochures: Your basic brochures introduce your 
organization to people who are new to your organization. You might 
hand out brochures at special events, include them in press kits, or 
share them with your community foundation or other area agencies.
 
✓ Pledge cards: You will include pledge cards in your annual fund appeal 
letters and also have them on-hand for personal visits and special events.
 
✓ Basic annual report: Depending on the expectations of your donors, you 
may decide that you don’t need to print your annual report — especially 
when you see the potential cost-savings. Many organizations decide 
to print a limited number of annual reports that interested donors can 
order by request, while making the report available as a downloadable 
file online. Because these are more high-profile than other print pieces, 
we devote a section to them later in this chapter.
 
Consider posting your printed materials on your Web site so that donors 
can download and print them easily. That way you leverage all the effort that 
went into the printed pieces, tell your story cost-effectively (by not having to 
print as many copies), and give donors the option to print them when and if 
they want to.
Do you even need print anymore?
Print materials can be costly and labor-intensive 
to produce — and with the rising cost of post-
age, they’re getting increasingly expensive to 
send. With so many possibilities available for 
sharing information online and electronically, 
in PDF format, do you really need print at all?
During times of economic cutbacks, evaluating 
the investment you make in print and determin-
ing whether you’re getting your money’s worth 
in donor return is a good idea. That being said, 
however, offering your donor something in 
print can speak volumes for you long after your 
meeting is over, which is a benefit you can’t 
ignore. No matter how convincing your presen-
tation to a major prospect may be, your words 
may fade quickly from your donor’s mind if you 
don’t have something to leave behind. Leaving 
behind a folder with the annual report, the cur-
rent newsletter, and a program brochure or two 
gives your donor something to review — and 
remember — after you’ve left.
Print pieces also offer several other benefits. 
For example, they can
 ✓ Be your communication (through the mail) 
to donors you can’t visit face to face
 ✓ Keep donors informed and involved with 
your programs
 ✓ Reach new donors
 ✓ Build your organization’s identity when dis-
tributed in the community
 ✓ Be included in your corporate and founda-
tion grant-proposal packages
 ✓ Reinforce the stability and credibility of 
your organization

Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Saving money on printing
Printing doesn’t have to eat up a large portion of your total fundraising 
budget. Here are just a few ideas on how you can save money on your print-
ing (we’re sure you can think of others, as well):
 
✓ Print only what you really need. Although you may want to send a 
personalized letter about your organization’s current projects to every 
donor on your list, perhaps sending a simple, conversational e-mail 
message will do the trick. That way you may not need a full-color bro-
chure describing those projects in detail. Or if your heart is set on the 
print brochure, consider going with a single-color or two-color piece to 
reduce the printing costs.
 
✓ Use a full-service copy shop. You can print at a full-service copy shop 
rather than a print shop and still have nice print pieces.
 
✓ Do it yourself. Computers, graphic design software, and laser print-
ers have made print pieces easier and less costly than ever to produce 
in small volume right in your own office. Buy brochure stock at your 
local office supply store, and then print on that stock, using your laser 
printer. Use document templates in software products such as Microsoft 
Word or Publisher to easily generate self-mailing flyers, brochures, or 
business cards.
 
✓ Try to get your printing donated. You may be able to align with another 
organization, such as a local library, that can do your printing as an in-
kind contribution. Or maybe one of your board members is a business 
owner and can donate some printing services. Ask around, and be cre-
ative. Many large organizations and companies in your area have their 
own printing resources and may be willing to share their resources to 
help your cause.
Showing progress with an annual report
Every business entity — from Fortune 500 corporations to the tiniest non-
profits — has an annual report, but today’s annual reports are changing a lot 
from those of years past. Traditionally, annual reports were slick, four-color, 
expensive print projects. But because of the advancements in technology and 
the easier and more flexible ways to share and download files today, printing 
annual reports isn’t mandatory for many organizations. Thus, you can pro-
duce a terrific report with great content, beautiful images, and a professional 
layout, but save the exorbitant cost of high-quality printing and make the 
report available as a downloadable PDF from your Web site. Some organiza-
tions also offer their annual reports as PowerPoint presentations or YouTube 
video clips.

187
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
No matter how you distribute your annual report (as a PDF or as a printed 
piece), it still serves the same purpose — to tell both the inspiring story and 
the story of accountability your organization wants to share. Your annual 
report does the following:
 
✓ Informs donors (and the community at large) about what you’ve been 
doing with the money you’ve received (referred to as accountability)
 
✓ Connects leaders of the organization with the public through letters or 
articles included in the report
 
✓ Reviews the accomplishments of the past year
 
✓ Thanks the people who helped you reach your yearly goals
 
✓ Announces goals for next year to tell donors your plans for using their 
donated dollars in the year to come
No hard-and-fast rule indicates exactly what elements you must include in 
your annual report, but your stakeholders expect to see
 
✓ Something from the board president
 
✓ Articles focusing on successes during the year
 
✓ Your mission statement
 
✓ Financial information
 
✓ A thank-you list of donors by amount or giving group
 
✓ A list of goals for the next year
 
A carefully timed year-end annual report helps remind donors of all the good 
they did in the current year and encourages them to build on their gifts in the 
coming year. Many organizations print only a few annual reports to provide to 
those donors who still want the printed version but make their annual reports 
available online for everyone else who’s interested. In this way, you can share 
your story in an attractive and compelling way with an unlimited number of 
people. And the flexibility and cost-savings that the electronic format offers 
makes it very appealing to any money-conscious fundraiser.
Taking the Direct (Mail) Approach
Direct mail has long been one of the most popular means of keeping donors 
in touch with the happenings at organizations. With a simple piece of mail, 
you can invite new donors to join your organization, tell existing donors what 
a difference their gifts are making, provide important information about the 
fiscal responsibility of your agency, and persuade donors to participate in 
giving clubs, planned-giving programs, and endowment campaigns.

188
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
Your overall goal with direct mail should be to draw donors closer toward the 
heart of your organization, with the end goal of continually upgrading them in 
their giving patterns until they reach the level of major givers, when possible. 
Direct mail casts a big net, and if you’re lucky, it may bring in some donors 
with whom you can cultivate a relationship over the years.
 
The problem with direct mail is that the open rate — the percentage that’s 
actually opened by recipients — of appeals is very small, which means you 
run the risk of wasting a lot of money on printing and postage unless you’re 
certain your mailing list will bring a good rate of return.
Direct mail can certainly be effective in some situations. In the following 
sections, we tell you when a direct mail campaign may be worth the time 
and money, and we explain when using e-mail may be a more effective (and 
money-saving) alternative to a direct mail appeal. Finally, we give you some 
hints on what to include in your mailing.
When direct mail works: Asking 
current donors to give again
You may want to consider using direct mail for a donor renewal campaign. 
Donor renewal refers to the process of contacting existing donors — members 
of your organization or people who donated to it last year — to get them to 
renew their membership or commitment. Direct mail pieces are likely to be a 
bit more effective with previous donors than with new prospects because
 
✓ The donors know what they’re getting (they were members last year).
 
✓ The donors are already in alignment with your mission.
 
✓ The donors already have a relationship with your organization.
When you offer a donor the convenience of renewing her membership 
through the mail, if she has had a positive experience with your organization 
in the past, she’s likely to renew. Direct mail campaigns also make you look 
businesslike and efficient, something donors like to see when they’re invest-
ing in your organization.
 
Even though you may be trying to reduce communications costs, putting a 
return envelope in your donor’s hands at least once a year is a good idea. 
Donors may collect solicitation letters for a while before deciding where they 
want to send their donations; giving them a return envelope serves as a good 
reminder and makes it as easy as possible for them to give to your organiza-
tion. If your donors don’t respond right away, don’t worry — the gift may 
arrive down the road somewhere, and the envelope helps increase the likeli-
hood that it will.

189
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
The big question is this: Do you need to use direct mail — that is, real printed 
letters in real printed envelopes — to get that renewal you’re seeking? 
Perhaps an e-mail would work as well, at a fraction of the cost.
When the most direct mail is e-mail
If our mailboxes are any indication, direct mail is still alive and well and on 
the radar screens of most nonprofit organizations. Times are changing, how-
ever, and the tightening of budgets is causing many organizations to look 
carefully for ways to trim expenses from their operating budgets, which is 
where e-mail comes in.
E-mail can be an inexpensive and effective way to reach your donors for sev-
eral reasons:
 
✓ Your donor management software likely has an e-mail feature built in 
that enables you to sort your list and track the messages sent.
 
✓ Most of your donors are probably comfortable with e-mail and can read 
it at their convenience.
 
✓ Today’s e-mail messages can carry images and branding, which enables 
you to include your logo, program photos, and more.
 
✓ Some software enables you to track e-mail open rates so you know how 
many donors are actually reading your message.
 
✓ E-mail enables your donor to take action immediately — by clicking a 
link to give electronically, sending you a return e-mail message, or going 
to your Web site.
 
Composing an effective e-mail message is similar to writing a great direct mail 
letter. Be personable. Be real. Give the donor the facts, but make your call to 
action clear by adding a link that says Click here to make your donation now, 
for example. Invite feedback by providing a return e-mail address or adding a 
link recipients can click to ask a question or pass along an idea or comment.
Chapter 15 has more details about how to build e-mail campaigns and create 
and send e-mail newsletters to your donors. It’s easier — and more cost-
effective — than you may think.
 
If using e-mail for direct appeals is new for your organization, test the 
approach with a select group of donors first. After they receive the message, 
ask them to send you their thoughts. Was your message clear in the e-mail? 
Did your recipients know what to do with it? Would they prefer e-mail or 
direct mail in the future? Be sure to use the feedback you receive and thank 
the donors somewhere publicly — on your Web site, perhaps — for the time 
they took to share their ideas with you.

190
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Figuring out what to send
When you’re ready to put your direct mail piece together (whether you’re 
using traditional postal delivery or e-mail), what do you need to include? 
Here are the basics of what you need to include with most mailings:
 
✓ The letter: Write your letter of purpose in a friendly and earnest tone — 
telling specific stories of people your mission has helped. Some addi-
tional tips for the letter include:
 
• Spend time crafting your opening sentence and the P.S. to make 
sure they convey the main ideas of your campaign and your orga-
nization because many people read only these elements.
 
• Think carefully about who signs the letter. Someone well known or 
high up in the organization brings the most credibility. For exam-
ple, former President Jimmy Carter and his wife write direct mail 
appeals for Habitat for Humanity. If you have a high-profile spokes-
person, make the most of that person; even if you don’t have one, 
think of people in your area who would enhance the credibility of 
the pieces you send out.
 
 The most effective approach in direct mail is to create the letter so 
that it looks as though it was sent from a person the donor knows. 
If the donor recognizes the name and knows the person who sent 
the letter, she’s likely to at least open the letter as a courtesy to 
the person who sent it.
 
• Think in terms of emotional appeal, but provide facts, too. A reader 
may turn away from your cause if you hit her with too much emotion 
too quickly. Tell the story of the need by giving the facts on how her 
donation can help your organization meet that need. In a challenging 
economy, you have the opportunity to tell the very real story of how 
the demand for your services is creating a greater need.
 
• Keep the letter brief; to one page, if possible. Use attachments if 
you need to supply more details.
 
• Call for action in the letter, giving the donor a specific amount 
to respond to (say, for example, “Your gift of $75 will help feed a 
family of four for three months!”).
 
✓ The pledge form: The pledge form is the actual response form the donor 
fills out and returns to your organization along with her pledge or dona-
tion. Be sure to include room for the donor to correct changed contact 
information. Remember to also include your organization’s name and 
bulk mail number on the pledge cards if you want donors to send them 
to you via return mail. (A bulk mail number enables you to send a large 
mailing by using the number — which shows you have paid for a bulk mail 
account — instead of stamping individual envelopes.) To save money on 
the return postage, you can get a bulk mail permit by going to your local 
post office, requesting a bulk mail application, and paying a small fee.

191
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
 
 A number of nonprofits that rely heavily on direct mail techniques use 
their bulk mail permit on the envelope but add a note, saying something 
like, “Your first-class stamp here will help us feed another family!” (when 
the organization raises funds to feed families). Doing so can save the 
organization mailing costs and give the donor yet another easy way to 
make a difference.
 
Before you print and send your direct mail piece, pass a sample around the 
office and ask for feedback. Is it upbeat? Does it give the reader a good sense 
of the organization? Is the call to action clear? Make sure your mail piece hits 
the mark before you commit the funds to send it on its way.
To Call or Not to Call
Telephone solicitors have a bad reputation — and for good reason. 
Unwanted phone calls seem even more intrusive than spam or junk mail or 
magazine salespeople who knock on your front door at dinnertime. For this 
reason, many fundraisers have a bad taste in their mouths when they think 
about turning telephone solicitors loose on their donor lists. However, armed 
with a few good tips and some careful planning, your callers can make your 
telephone campaign effective. (If you want more information about dialing for 
dollars than what we provide in the following sections, check out Telephone 
Sales For Dummies by Dirk Zeller [Wiley].)
Making your callers the good guys
Before you can find success in your telephone campaign, you need to make 
sure you have the best people doing the calling. Who will make the calls? 
Here are a few ideas:
 
✓ Start with your board. Anyone interested?
 
✓ Ask your volunteer corps. If you have a group of positive, like-minded 
people, you may have a swirl of interest. If you have a collection of 
busy professionals, you may get a lot of people looking at the ceiling. 
Persuade reluctant volunteers with (1) how much good they can do 
for the organization, (2) how they will benefit socially by helping in a 
group for only a few hours on a special weekend, and (3) a promise of 
a reward, such as a discount on their membership renewal or an invita-
tion to a thank-you dinner after the campaign is over.
 
✓ Go to the people you serve. If your nonprofit is a school or university, 
consider asking parents, alumni, or the students themselves to do the 
calling.

192
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
After you pick the people you want to call your donors, make sure they know 
what to do to make each call an opportunity. Most importantly, they need to 
do the following:
 
✓ Respect people’s privacy and call before or after traditional dinnertime.
 
✓ Call only those individuals you identify as being interested in your mis-
sion and likely to want to help.
 
✓ Acknowledge the donor’s gifts and services in prior years.
 
✓ Be attentive to people’s responses and engage them without being pushy.
 
✓ Care about issues people raise and attempt to address those issues or 
refer the call to someone in your organization who can.
 
The purpose of your calling campaign doesn’t always have to be to ask for 
money. When you use your phone program to update your donor list, ask 
people’s opinion about a new program you’re thinking of launching, or simply 
say “Thanks” to a significant donor, you go a long way toward building your 
donor-agency relationship. No-strings-attached calls like these examples say 
to your donors, “We value you for more than just your money.”
Knowing your no-call responsibilities
The last several years have seen much legislation and discussion about 
telemarketing. Make sure to check the latest regulations before you start 
a telephone campaign — we address the current scoop here. Some states 
Calling donors and getting their data all at once
If you plan on making a significant splash in 
the world of telephone soliciting, you may be 
interested to know that the high-end telephone 
industry is merging audio and data capabilities 
like you wouldn’t believe.
With some telemarketing technology, when 
you make a call, a computer logs the phone 
number; then instantly, before anyone even 
says “Hello,” all the pertinent data about the 
donor and her history is displayed on your com-
puter screen, including where she lives, how 
much she’s given, where she works, and what 
her dog’s name is. (Okay, maybe not the dog’s 
name, but you get the idea.)
If you plan to do a considerable amount of tele-
phoning over the long-term, look into purchas-
ing (or getting donated) sophisticated phone 
and data systems to help you capture, use, and 
maintain all the data that’s available through 
your donor list and telephone system. These 
systems may be luxury items in a down econ-
omy — or perhaps completely unnecessary if 
you phone donors only once a year when you’re 
soliciting funds for a special event.

193
 Chapter 12: Connecting for Profits: Sharing Your Story by Print, Mail, and Phone
have their own statutes, which may be more stringent than the federal laws. 
Be sure you find out about your state laws as you plan your phone 
campaign.
The FCC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry; however, you may not 
realize that it doesn’t cover all types of calls. This registry prohibits only 
calls made to sell goods or services through interstate phone calls. It doesn’t 
prohibit calls from political organizations, charities, or telephone surveyors.
What if you sell products to raise funds? You may still be able to call if you’ve 
done business with the person you’re calling in the last 18 months. Having 
done business in that time period makes your relationship with that person 
an existing business relationship, in which, presumably, the recipient of the 
call has shown an interest in your products by buying them in the past. 
However, if someone asks you not to call, even if you have an existing busi-
ness relationship, that’s it — you can’t call that person again.
One final note: Beyond your legal obligations, in the interest of your donor 
relationship, if you get the message that someone doesn’t want to receive 
calls, take that person off your call list and find another way to communicate 
with her — perhaps e-mail would be a better option.
 
Telemarketing to cellphones is illegal. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers 
from using automated dialers to call cellphone numbers.
Working the phones with 
a positive attitude
If you think a phone campaign is the way to go, here are seven principles 
to help you (and your callers) stay on the straight and narrow, honor your 
donors’ choices, and maybe even bring in some much-needed donations:
 
✓ Respect the donor. Listen, listen, listen, and provide just the informa-
tion your donor needs — and then get off the phone. Tell your story, 
invite the donor’s gift, and respect the donor’s time.
 
✓ Be friendly. Anticipate a good response, and smile as you dial. 
Remember why you’re proud of your organization, and choose two or 
three things to share with the person you’re calling. Even if the recipient 
is less than enthusiastic, remember that your voice and demeanor leave 
the person listening with a sense of your organization.
 
✓ Prepare a script and know it well. Know your call script inside and out 
before you call, and think through different types of call recipients — 
welcoming, surly, resistant, curious, and so on. Know what to do when 

194
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
the donor asks you a question not on the script. Consider the resources 
you need before you call, and know what to do when you can’t answer 
a call recipient’s question (refer the recipient to another person in your 
organization, for example).
 
 As you prepare your script, make sure you include the following elements:
 
• The name of your organization
 
• A brief statement of your mission
 
• The fact that you’re participating in a campaign to raise funds for a 
specific program and a description of what that program is
 
• An example sentence for you to use to ask the renewing member 
(or current member) if he would like to upgrade his gift
 
✓ Believe in your cause. Chances are that believing in your cause comes 
naturally, but you may want to reread your mission statement before 
you call. Think of a few real stories you can share about people who 
have been helped by the programs and services you offer.
 
✓ Smile throughout the call. Even if you’re a bit nervous when you make 
the call, try to relax and smile. The recipient can hear the smile in your 
voice, and your message carries better.
 
✓ Get the name right. Mispronouncing the person’s name in a phone call 
doesn’t do much for your chances of getting a donation. The mispro-
nounced name tells the listener, “This person doesn’t really know me,” 
and that creates instant resistance to your message.
 
✓ Don’t take a no personally. Try to hear a no from a donor as a not 
yet, which may eventually lead to a yes. When you’re on the phone 
with someone, hearing no without taking it personally may be difficult 
because of the personal contact, but be pleasant about the recipient’s 
response. Remember that your response after the no is still a relationship-
building moment for your donor — the way you respond makes a big dif-
ference in the way he perceives what you do.
 
 Even when a prospective donor tells you no, recognize that you have 
made an impact and a personal connection for your organization. That 
connection helps build awareness for your agency, which may result 
in a donation down the road. That’s why it’s especially important to be 
friendly, professional, and accommodating. Though the person may not 
give today, he may be impressed by your group, which is an important 
part of your ongoing storytelling effort.

▶ Dealing with damage control on media disasters
Y
ou’re not camera shy, are you? Don’t worry — many people are at least 
a little bashful, at first. But being willing and able to pursue media expo-
sure for your organization is both smart for your fundraising program and 
advantageous for building the overall credibility of your cause. Arming your-
self with some basic how-tos for handling, and even enjoying, media relations 
can give you the confidence you need to see media for what it is: a golden 
microphone to address masses of people.
Although working with media takes a little time and some careful and cre-
ative thought, your use of the media can go a long way toward building an 
awareness of and a reputation for your organization. Having an outgoing per-
sonality helps, but it’s not a prerequisite. All you have to do is master a few 
media basics and you can communicate your cause clearly and with passion.
In this chapter, we take you through a number of media channels, helping 
you investigate ways to get positive attention for your nonprofit organiza-
tion through radio, television, print media, and the Internet. (In this chapter, 
we touch on using the Internet to create awareness; we cover how to use 
social networking, e-mail, Web sites, and blogs in more detail in Chapters 14 
through 17.)
Getting the Media Exposure You Want
Many fundraisers work day in and day out without giving a lot of thought to 
media coverage. If media attention happens, great (assuming it’s positive, 
of course!), but who has time to go looking for it? When you consider the 
amount of time you spend researching donors, narrowing down your donor 

196
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
list, and educating people about your mission and your programs, however, 
you realize that spending just a little time planning some media exposure can 
pay back many times over in terms of public awareness and interest.
Here we give you an overview of how you can work with the media to pro-
mote your organization, and we offer some ideas on how to improve your 
chances at getting your organization’s story in the media.
Realizing what the media can do for you
Not every mention of your organization has to be the lead story in the morn-
ing newspaper or on the evening news. Rather, you can use the media to let 
the public know about everyday events and activities your group is doing. 
The following list includes some other ways you can use media exposure to 
promote your organization:
 
✓ Prepare news releases, requests for volunteers, and event announce-
ments to run free on the radio or on local news calendars in the form 
of public service announcements. (Check out the “Working in Sound 
Bites: Public Service Announcements” section for more details.)
 
✓ Do a television or radio interview, talking about a new survey released 
by your organization.
 
✓ Make your organization the subject of a feature article in your local 
newspaper or magazine that ties in to concerns in your community.
 
✓ Create a Facebook group for your organization or event.
 
✓ Create a Twitter feed that shares ongoing program news, announce-
ments, and links.
 
✓ Post video clips of your programs and events on YouTube, and then 
post the links to your Facebook and Twitter pages.
 
✓ Create a blog to build visibility in your area of work; link to other 
groups, funders, and organizations that seek to meet the same need.
 
✓ Create and post podcasts as a way of sharing success stories, inviting 
others to get involved, or spotlighting critical issues in your service 
area.
 
✓ Participate in an online chat on a Web site that deals with issues in your 
organization’s area of work.
Think of media exposure as a way to educate your community about your 
organization. When you run a 30-second radio spot, for example, you tell the 
listeners who you are, what you do, why they should care, and how they can 
help.

197
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
In a short television interview, perhaps on your local afternoon news pro-
gram, you can
 
✓ Inform viewers about your organization, perhaps for the first time.
 
✓ Offer viewers a visual of what your organization is all about, perhaps 
through a video of a recent event at your facility or video clips of your 
organization’s volunteers working with those you serve.
 
✓ Provide viewers with contact information so they can get in touch with 
you if they want to (through an on-screen display of your organization’s 
name, phone number, and logo, for example).
 
✓ Allow viewers to put a face with a name.
 
✓ Interest viewers in your organization’s current work or upcoming 
events.
In a print article in your local paper, you can
 
✓ Relate how your organization is currently addressing real needs in your 
community.
 
✓ Convey a sense of the spark of your mission.
 
✓ Educate readers about various programs you’re currently working on.
 
✓ Include contact information encouraging readers to donate time, goods, 
or money.
 
✓ Showcase a success story to build confidence and trust in your work.
With Web and social media exposure, you can
 
✓ Establish your social networking presence.
 
✓ Raise awareness about a community need and your organization’s 
relevance.
 
✓ Show visitors who you are and what you do (through words, video, and 
photos).
 
✓ Gather an audience by enabling visitors to become friends, fans, or 
followers.
 
✓ Share upcoming events or program announcements.
 
✓ Provide links that are helpful for visitors.

198
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Making the first contact
For many nonprofits, the road to media exposure begins with a simple 
press release, which is an announcement of an event or other newsworthy 
item you send to press outlets — newspapers, Web sites, and TV and radio 
stations — in your local area. Just a few years ago, you mailed or faxed 
press releases to media outlets, but today the approach of choice is e-mail. 
In your press release, be sure to include the name of someone at your 
organization whom the media and/or your audience can contact about the 
information in the release — and make doubly sure that you’ve got the right 
address for the media recipient.
Getting the most of your media time
One of the challenges in getting media exposure 
is that you have very little time in which to relay 
some really important information. Take a look 
at these media forms in terms of the amount of 
time each one offers you:
 ✓ Radio: A typical PSA (public service 
announcement) gives you only 30 to 60 sec-
onds of airtime.
 ✓ Television: Even a lengthy news interview 
may be only two minutes of actual airtime; 
and when you clip out newscaster lead-ins 
and voice-overs, you may have only one 
minute of real footage from your organiza-
tion or your interview. More typically, you 
have less than 30 seconds.
 ✓ Online: When you’re leading a chat, you 
have a longer period of time to get your 
main points across to your audience (up 
to an hour, in some cases); but the medium 
requires tight control — a group chat can 
be like carrying on 20 individual conversa-
tions at once. Moderated discussion forums 
and your own Web site allow you to post 
information and leave it there indefinitely 
for people to see. An online broadcast or 
Webcast can give you greater flexibility, 
but viewers tend to watch only the first 
few minutes of live or prerecorded con-
tent. Facebook, Twitter, and blogs offer as 
much content exposure as you want for as 
long as you want because these channels 
belong to you. For that reason, however, 
they may not carry as much credibility with 
potential visitors as third-party “objective” 
media groups may offer.
 ✓ Print: Print is a medium in which the time 
allotted is virtually unlimited. You may have 
an hour interview with a reporter, which 
translates into a (hopefully) good story 
that the reader can read again and again 
if she chooses. If the article appears on the 
newspaper’s Web site, you can link to it 
from your own site for even greater expo-
sure. Make sure to keep copies of print 
articles to make available in your fundrais-
ing packets, as well.

199
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
 
The press release approach is likely to work better if you’ve taken the time to 
develop good relationships with media leaders in your community (see the 
next section for details).
 
Just as you do with donors and grantors, find out what interests your local 
media and consider how you can help your needs and theirs fit together. 
Media people get inundated with press releases and bids for inclusion on 
their Web and print pages. Give them interesting information in a profes-
sional format and you’ll get into their good graces — eventually. Human-
interest stories — stories about people’s successes, challenges, and needs 
that draw empathy and sympathy — are widely used in all media, and most 
nonprofits have these stories by the dozens.
Coming up with story ideas for the media
Does your local feature reporter yawn when he sees you coming? Have the 
radio stations stopped running your PSAs (public service announcements)? 
How do you get your media contacts to wake up and take notice of the good 
work your organization is doing?
The following tips can help you come up with stories and other media ideas 
that the media will want to run:
 
✓ Show your role in responding to a community crisis. For example, if a 
measles outbreak has occurred in your area, your Vaccines-for-Every-
Child program fits right into the media hoopla. Offer to do a live inter-
view or write an article in which you offer more details about both the 
crisis and your response to it. Remember the old PR line, “A good crisis 
is a terrible thing to waste.” Get a local celebrity whose area of expertise 
relates to the crisis to talk about it for you. In the best-case scenario, 
this person is one of your board members.
 
✓ Plan an event that links with another current-events story in the news. 
For example, if you run a literacy program, plan a Read-a-Thon to occur 
just before school starts to fund your new reading program, and plan a 
Graduate Celebration at year’s end to reward people who have achieved 
their goals through your program. These types of success stories make a 
nice topper to the sometimes hard-to-take evening news.
 
✓ Look for happy media opportunities. Suppose that someone’s favor-
ite feline climbed to the top of the tallest tree at your recent Humane 
Society pet show, and your board president, who also just happens to 
be the fire chief, climbed a ladder and got her down. Grab your camera, 
or better yet, alert the media, if they’re close. You just might get to be 
the “good news” at the end of the show.

200
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
 Don’t create such opportunities where none exist — experienced news 
people can smell a plant-the-cat-in-the-tree hoax a mile away, and it can 
damage your relationship and your credibility with the press. Besides, 
you don’t want to endanger a pussycat or your board president for your 
15 seconds of fame.
 
✓ Don’t wait for the media to call you. If you have a good idea, be willing 
to talk about it. Don’t alienate your media contacts by barraging them 
with inane ideas, but when you have an interesting idea that lends itself 
to a good radio, television, or print story, knock on the necessary doors.
 
✓ Refresh your content. If you’ve been describing your organization the 
same way for two years in every press release, or if the paragraph at the 
end of your releases describing the history of your group has read the 
same for five years, rewrite it to jazz it up.
Working in Sound Bites: Public 
Service Announcements
If you aren’t currently using any media at all, you may be pleased to find out 
that you have one completely free media avenue open to you right this very 
minute — and that avenue is public service announcements (PSAs). PSAs are 
radio, television, and sometimes print advertisements that enable you to get 
the news out about what your nonprofit organization is doing. Are you host-
ing a chili cook-off next month? Preparing to release your latest community 
development report? Let your city know about it through a PSA.
Government regulations of the public’s airwaves require that television and 
radio producers offer free public service announcements to local nonprofit 
organizations. Although many newspapers offer such announcements as part 
of their civic responsibility, no federal regulation requires them to do so.
Check with your local station about rules for PSAs, but be aware that most 
stations require you to schedule recording time in advance. Be sure to men-
tion your organization’s name, your nonprofit status, your mission, who you 
serve, important information about your event, and the way the public can 
contact you. Mention your Web address several times, and check with the 
station director to request a copy of the PSA so you can make it available for 
playback or download on your Web site.
 
When you talk to the folks at the radio station, request that your PSA be aired 
during prime listening time (6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). Often PSAs get pushed to 
the off-peak hours (7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) because the paying clients fill the 
commercial air slots during prime time, but it’s worth asking for prime time. 
Also, don’t hesitate to ask whether the station offers special deals for nonprof-
its buying airtime; many do.

201
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
 
If you’re recording for radio for the first time, here’s a tip: Smile as you talk. 
When you smile as you read, the sound of your smile carries in your voice — 
no kidding! Listeners will find your voice more pleasant and personable and 
may just end up smiling, too.
Looking Good on Television
Come on; tell the truth — you’ve always wanted to be on television, right? 
With the seemingly endless range of cable channels, the ever-lengthening 
morning and nightly news programs, and the dozens of talk shows (stay 
away from the ones that tend to have fistfights), television presents you with 
countless opportunities for wide exposure. In the following sections, we give 
you some advice for making the most of your television opportunities.
Seeking airtime on the small screen
Television opportunities aren’t part of the daily fare for most nonprofits, but 
there’s nothing stopping you from pitching your own possibilities. You could 
suggest TV coverage to your local station for your upcoming special event 
where a popular personality is appearing; follow a nightly news story with 
a related successful initiative you’ve launched; or work on a televised fund-
raising campaign for your public television station. (Hey, don’t laugh — you 
could sit at a desk for an hour answering the phone with your nametag and 
organization name in front of you. The message to viewers is “we help other 
organizations, too,” which says a lot about the character of your agency.)
Preparing for a television interview
Suppose that your organization’s idea has captured the attention of a local 
TV news producer, and now she’d like to send a reporter out to talk to you 
about the ranch you run for at-risk teens. Now what?
First, say, “Sure! Come on out!” in the most confident voice you can muster. 
Next, spend some time thinking about what you’re going to say and do during 
the interview. Consider the following questions as you prepare for your tele-
vision interview:
 
✓ Who is the best person to talk to the reporter? Whether the person 
doing the talking is the founder, the board president, the executive 
director, or you, make sure that person is (1) personable, (2) articulate, 
and (3) passionate about your organization’s mission and the work 
you’re currently doing.

202
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
✓ What do you want to say most? You only have a few minutes on tape. 
Get clear in your mind what you most want to say, and then, even if the 
reporter asks questions that take you in a different direction, steer the 
conversation back to what you really want to say about your organization.
 
 Think success stories. Although the temptation to focus on the need 
may be great, remember that you want to show viewers that good things 
are happening at your organization and inspire them to want to be part 
of the good that’s going on.
 
✓ What do you want viewers to see during the interview? Think through 
the eyes of the camera. Where do you want to shoot the interview? What 
does the place look like? How can you help viewers get a sense of your 
mission? The biggest impact comes from the picture of work actually 
being done, not from people talking about the work that’s being done 
somewhere off-camera. If you have footage of your organization at work, 
provide it to the producer to cut away to during your interview.
 
✓ What do you wear? Dress for success. On video, busy patterns in your 
clothing can be distracting patterns. Avoid patterns, stripes, and bright 
white clothing. Your best bet is something simple and subdued. And 
here’s a little tip: Blues work great on video.
After you make your way through these questions and feel relatively pre-
pared for your television interview, make sure you practice, practice, 
practice (do we need to say it again?). Before you go on the air, try a mock 
interview with a friend or colleague, especially if you know somebody 
with public speaking or media experience. Check out Public Speaking For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Malcolm Kushner (Wiley), to get more ideas on 
how to make a flawless presentation.
Remembering on-air cues
When you’re sitting in the hot seat and see the big open eye of the camera 
on you (or the oversized microphones hanging above your head), keep your 
wits about you and remember to do the following:
 
✓ Relax. Relaxing is the name of the game. If you practice what you want 
to say until you know it inside and out, you can relax and be yourself 
during the interview. Remember you’re representing good work — that 
in itself, not your performance, is what carries the day.
 
✓ Make a good first impression. Start your interview smiling, whether 
you’re sitting behind a camera or sitting in a recording studio, as in the 
case of a radio interview. When the camera’s red light blinks on, don’t 
do a Fred Flintstone and stare blank-eyed and slack-jawed into the lens. 
As the producer counts down, take a deep breath and release it, sending 
with your exhale any negative thoughts and tensions about the interview. 

203
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
Then smile and answer the questions one at a time, as they come, in the 
best way you know how — after all, that’s all you can do.
 
✓ Keep it short. Whether you’re being interviewed or contributing to a 
panel discussion, keep your comments brief and packed with meaning. 
Say what you want to say, say it smart, say it concisely, and be as clear 
as possible. Your audience (and interviewers) will thank you for it.
 
✓ Give your audience something to remember. Whether your audience 
members are in your industry or just listening casually out there in 
audience-land, try to leave them with something concrete they can try — 
a new idea to consider or a new tool to use.
 
✓ Don’t just tell them; show them. If you have control over any part of
 the story — for example, if the television crew is sending a camera
person out to your facility to film the interviews on-premises — use every 
opportunity to show viewers what you do instead of simply telling them.
 
✓ Provide your Web address. Chances are the show’s producer will 
already be on top of this tip, but, if no one asks you, ask the reporter or 
producer whether your organization’s Web address can be posted along 
the bottom of the screen during the interview. Most news channels also 
make links available on their Web site for a limited period of time.
 
✓ Take the interview with you. Before the reporter leaves, ask whether 
the video will be made available on the station’s Web site. Find out 
whether your organization can embed the video on your own Web site 
or on social media sites. Every little bit of exposure helps.
Even in an on-camera interview, you aren’t talking to a camera; you’re talk-
ing to a person. When you’re doing a call-in show, you’re still talking to real 
people on the other end of the phone line. Remember that the person you’re 
talking to is the most important person in the world at that time.
 
Give each interviewer your undivided attention, and focus carefully on the 
subject at hand. The media feeling just falls away, and the interview becomes 
part of what you’re so good at: the relationship building that’s so much a part 
of the fabric of fundraising.
Taking Advantage of Print Opportunities
Suppose that getting into print is your objective. Depending on your back-
ground and the type of organization you work with, finding print opportuni-
ties may be easier than getting a slice of that coveted airtime you need for 
a television interview. What kind of print opportunities do you have in your 
area? Your local media may include daily, weekly, or county newspapers; 
community foundation newsletters; chamber of commerce publications; busi-
ness journals; and more.

204
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
And what are all these print sources looking for? Something quotable, some-
thing unique, something people will talk about and repeat today and tomor-
row, something people will come back for more of. (See the “Making yourself 
quotable” section for more details on how to give print sources exactly what 
they’re looking for.)
Community foundation newsletters are a great place to break into print and 
get the word out about your organization. These newsletters often include 
features about nonprofit groups in the local area. Keeping people up to date 
is an important part of their objective, and they offer broad circulation and 
credibility because the information they publish is all related to nonprofit 
organizations.
 
A key to making good use of print coverage is to use every bit of news as 
another reason to get in print. If you run a playwriting competition, announce 
that you’re accepting entries and have selected judges; then publicize the 
pending final deadline for entries, the judges’ choices, the awards ceremony, 
and so on. Build excitement about longer programs and keep the public 
engaged.
Making yourself quotable
Editors love a good quote, and there’s nothing wrong with writing a few 
favorites up before an interview so you have them ready. After you iden-
tify what you want to say, write a few statements that relate to that idea. 
Remember the elevator pitch for your mission statement? It’s that simple, 
heart-felt statement that tells people what you do in a few short words. Your 
quote is a good place to put that idea into play.
 
A good quote sounds right, is short enough to remember, touches the heart, 
and includes a call to action.
In other words, your quote should almost burst with meaning and impact. 
A good quote will resonate with the person who hears it and reinforce what 
you want her to remember about your organization — your mission, your 
compassion, your impact.
Fixing mistakes in print
What happens when the reporter gets something wrong? He forgets to add 
that you’re a 501(c)(3) organization, or he publishes your fundraising goal for 
your new campaign as $1 million when it’s really only $250,000. Worst of all, 

205
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
he misspells the name of your biggest donor, the one who recently gave you 
a donation large enough to purchase art supplies for your kids for the next 
three years.
First, keep your cool. Next, write down the errors in the article and call the 
reporter or send him an e-mail message. Go over the items with him (calmly), 
and ask him to print a correction in the same spot in the next issue. He prob-
ably has to talk the situation over with his managing editor (in fact, you may 
need to talk it over with his managing editor, as well), but most newspapers 
are willing to correct errors that you call to their attention. And — here’s a 
bit of good news — the correction gets your name in print again.
 
Choose your battles wisely. Don’t be ready to duke it out over every misspell-
ing or piece of erroneous reporting related to an upcoming event. However, if 
the article compromises your mission, tarnishes your reputation, or in some 
other way creates a negative public awareness, by all means, take your case to 
the editor. You want to maintain a long-term relationship with the publication, 
but be willing to contest false or misleading statements in print.
Leveraging Online Coverage
Today the Web is rivaling print and even television as a suitable news outlet. 
Newspapers are feeling the pinch, in fact, and more and more organizations 
are offering premium news stories on the Web as exclusive stories (instead 
of in print as they once did). Part of maximizing your exposure in the media 
definitely includes thinking through Web-based outlets for your stories and 
updates, which is where this section and Chapters 14 through 17 come in.
 
For more about creating and building social media channels — including 
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube — see Chapter 14.
Begin by using your favorite search engine to look for sites that talk about 
the following topics: philanthropy, charitable giving, fundraising, and non-
profit organizations. Search for Web sites that relate to your mission: If you 
help homeless teens, search with terms such as teens, homeless, and run-
aways. Check out the promising sites to find out
 
✓ What they have to offer in terms of information or resources
 
✓ Whether they allow nonprofits to put their own links on the site
 
✓ Whom to contact if you want to contribute an article idea or story
The following sections explain how to get stories about your nonprofit 
posted on other Web sites.

As part of your effort to gain an online presence for your organization, you 
can approach the editors of online versions of print publications about pos-
sibilities for feature articles. Sites such as www.msnbc.com, www.usatoday.
com, or your local newspaper may be open to your ideas. Visit these sites 
and review their policies on article submissions.
Though the Web has global reach, don’t overlook interest in your cause right in 
your own community. Your hometown may also offer sites that give nonprofits 
free exposure on the Web. The information the nonprofits provide on these 
sites may be nothing fancy, of course; but you can add your organization’s name 
and mission to a page along with a link to your organization’s own Web site (see 
Chapter 16 for more about maintaining a Web site for your organization).
Filling a need for news 
with news feeds and blogs
Most Web sites today don’t have time to write all their own content. Instead, 
they use news feeds or RSS feeds (Really Simple Syndication) to pull stories 
from other sources and display them, or links to them, on their sites. The 
Christian Science Monitor and CNN are just two sites that offer news feeds, but 
RSS is everywhere. Some news feeds aggregate stories from many sources. The 
point of doing so is to multiply your exposure by getting your story placed on a 
site that provides news feeds of its stories to others. There are various Web 2.0 
tools you can use to add RSS feeds to your site — talk to your Web designer to 
find out which tool would be best for your organization’s site.
Blogs are another source of online information that your potential donors may 
read. A blog is simply a collection of frequently updated stories, comments, 
and links. Blogs are often opinionated and full of personality; in some cases, 
groups of people blog together toward a common goal. In fact, a number of 
nonprofit organizations use blogs “from the field” to share stories with various 
staff members around the globe. This kind of storytelling can be very effective 
in fundraising (flip to Chapter 17 to find out more about blogging).
Crisis Control: When Media 
Attention Is Unwanted
Not to end this chapter on a somber note, but we have to give you a few tips 
on what to do when you get media exposure you don’t want. Sometimes 
negative things happen that the public has a right to know about, and it’s the 

207
 Chapter 13: Projecting Your Image in the Media
media’s job to report them. For example, a board member gets investigated 
for some illegal activity, a volunteer dispute breaks out, or an inebriated MC 
hosts a special event.
Because public perception of your organization can have such a substantial 
impact on your fundraising, it’s important to respond to this type of coverage 
in a direct and candid way. Choose a person with authority in your organiza-
tion who isn’t directly involved in the crisis to speak about the situation. Make 
sure that the message expresses stability, responsibility, and the wish that the 
good work of your organization will continue even during this troubled time. 
Suggest that the person reflect on the organization’s mission before speaking 
to the press — this will help refocus the message on the ideas and approach 
of the organization and not the particular trouble that is currently impacting 
the organization’s reputation in the public eye. Taking the high road now and 
staying focused on your long-range goal (reaching the people you serve) will 
increase your standing in the long-term, so weather the storm with class.
Getting the crisis under control fast
When a disaster does happen and the media comes running, you need to 
think quickly on your feet about what to say to protect both the reputation of 
your organization and the trust you’ve built with your community. Here we 
give you some tips to help you quickly handle a media crisis:
 
✓ Don’t be defensive. Denial is not only pointless; it can also be downright 
dangerous when you’re talking about reputations, as the current politi-
cal environment in the United States has shown time and time again. 
Instead of defending your organization, shifting the blame, or claiming 
innocence, evaluate the situation as quickly as possible, and face the 
issue head-on. (It’s okay to tell the media, “We don’t know yet, but we’re 
finding out,” until you know what happened.)
 
✓ If you goofed, admit it and apologize. You may think admission is a 
logical outcome of not being defensive, but, in actuality, admission is 
something else entirely. Whether it’s a public or private gaff, don’t just 
refuse to be defensive; be determined to tell the truth. For instance, if 
you dropped the ball and applied $10,000 in restricted funds to your 
scholarship program, admit it. (Of course, if it’s a private issue, don’t go 
seeking media exposure to reveal your mess.) Remember that candor, 
with compassion, is helpful even when you’re delivering bad news — 
and it builds trust along the way. Apologizing for something that has 
impacted the organization, your donors, or the people you serve is not 
only smart crisis management — it’s the right thing to do.
 
✓ Do something about the problem. If the crisis has hurt or harmed — or 
maybe just annoyed — somebody and the media picks up the story, 
start by saying, “Our organization doesn’t exist to create situations 
like this. We’re here to help at-risk teens master the skills they need to 

208
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
be successful in life. We’re not yet sure how this happened, but we’re 
going to make very sure it doesn’t happen again. Now, here’s what we’re 
going to do about it. . . .” Then be sure to provide specifics on how you’ll 
approach this situation in the future. The bad press turns into an aware-
ness-building story that can help people find out about your organiza-
tion and about how it responds to a problem.
 
✓ Don’t ignore the situation — now or in the long-term. Be sure to 
address continuing questions about the problem with an honest face 
and straight talk. This reaction is important, both for the continuing 
pride of your organization (seeing how you and your board weather 
this storm gives added strength to your staff and volunteers) and for 
the rebuilding of your relationship with the community. Be prepared to 
answer questions and respond to the issue for as long as it takes. “No 
comment” may work in some public arenas for some organizations, but 
if you care about building a reputation for your nonprofit based on trust 
and good stewardship, being as open and above-board as possible is the 
best approach.
When trust has been broken, a quick fix and a claim of redemption don’t 
guarantee anyone’s belief; be prepared to use this situation as a positive 
building block — and a significant learning experience — for the organization 
you want to be in the future.
Drafting a disaster control plan
Although nobody wants to anticipate crises and consider ways to limit the 
damage done as a result, having a disaster control plan in place is a good 
idea — both for you, as the fundraiser, and for your board, as the protectors 
of your organization. In one of your board meetings, put “Media Crisis” on 
your agenda and get the board talking about the following questions:
 
✓ What kinds of disasters could we be faced with?
 
✓ What’s the worst that could happen? You may want to role-play a few 
of these uncomfortable scenarios. Or perhaps simply write out a few 
examples that would be realistic for your organization.
 
✓ How would we react if the worst happened? Come up with a specific 
series of steps that detail who takes charge, how you investigate, what 
team contacts the media outlets in your area, and what recovery mecha-
nisms you use to begin rebuilding your reputation.
After you draft a plan, write it up and make sure each board member has a 
copy. Make it part of your board packet and future board trainings. A disaster 
isn’t something anyone likes to think about, but the potential of one happen-
ing is there — as they say, better to be safe than sorry.

Social Networking: What’s the 
Connection for Your Organization?
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the ins and outs of social media
▶ Knowing who’s using social media and bringing them together for your cause
▶ Identifying what social media users are looking for
▶ Using social media effectively
▶ Deciding whether to use social networking outlets to ask for donations
R
eady for a great new idea in online fundraising? If you haven’t yet ven-
tured into the “friending” world of social media yourself, you may be 
surprised to hear that social media is offering an exciting new frontier for 
nonprofit organizations. Blossoming as the brainchild of Generation Y, social 
media combines the best of individual expression (blogging and more) with 
Web 2.0 tools, offering individuals and organizations a brilliant way to create 
custom audiences that are engaged, interactive, and having fun together.
Sounds like a great environment for a happy donor, doesn’t it?
This chapter gives you a glimpse of the quickly evolving offerings available 
in the social media realm. Here, you find out more about what social media 
is, which features are most helpful to you, and how you can use the tools to 
reach and mobilize your donors.
 
Even though social media may be the next great frontier in fundraising (or at 
least friendraising), if you’re running a one-person department trying to fund 
your organization, you have to be judicious about the way you spend your 
time. You may want to test the waters with a social media tool that doesn’t 
take a lot of time — like Twitter — and try it consistently for a month. See 
whether it strikes a chord with your donors. Test the tool and see whether it 
catches on. If it does, great — you know the tool is worth the time you invest. 
If it doesn’t, focus your attention on something that’s sure to bring the results 
you want.

Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Wondering about Web 2.0? Lucky for you, all you need to know to understand 
this chapter is that the second wave of Web technologies called Web 2.0 
introduced blogging, wiki generation, and social networking capabilities. In 
other words, the development of Web 2.0 made social media possible.
Getting Started with Social Media
Before you can understand how you and your organization can take advan-
tage of social media in a fundraising sense, you need to know a bit about 
social media, find out who’s using it, and discover how building community 
in this way can benefit your organization. Lucky for you, we address all three 
topics in the following sections.
Surveying the basics of social media
The world is abuzz with tweets and friends. Sound like a note you intercepted 
from your sixth grader? Well, it isn’t. It’s becoming the talk of grown-ups 
everywhere. This new conversation is unfolding — with or without you — on 
computers reaching around the world. With the help of super-popular sites 
like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, and more, friends and friends of 
friends are becoming fans of organizations like yours, sending updates and 
Web links to others they know, and posting comments, photos, and opinions 
about their favorite causes worldwide.
Social media, put simply, is about the relationships and links made through 
social interaction online. A number of different types of sites offer individuals 
and groups the ability to express themselves, create groups of friends and 
fans, invite comments and crosslinking, and much more. Some of the most 
popular social media sites include the following:
 
✓ For connecting with friends, family, events, and causes: Facebook 
(www.facebook.com), LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com), MySpace 
(www.myspace.com), and Ning (www.ning.com)
 
✓ For microblogging (presence technology): Twitter (www.twitter.com)
 
✓ For sharing photos: Flickr (www.flickr.com), Photobucket (www.
photobucket.com), and Picasa (www.picasa.com)
 
✓ For sharing events: Meetup (www.meetup.com)
 
✓ For wiki creation: Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org)
 
✓ For social news: Digg (www.digg.com)
 
✓ For sharing opinions: Epinions (www.epinions.com)

211
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
 
✓ For video sharing: YouTube (www.youtube.com)
 
✓ For asking and answering questions: Yahoo! Answers (www.answers.
yahoo.com)
Note: A wiki is a collaborative, open, Web-based, document-creation tool that 
enables an unlimited number of authors to create, modify, expand, and edit 
one another’s work.
 
The idea of creating a kind of “presence” with technology can be a powerful 
benefit for your organization because it builds connections, and, as you know, 
connections are the heart of your donor base. When you share what you’re 
doing on Twitter, post your organization’s stories on Facebook, or connect 
with others on LinkedIn, you’re inviting your donors into your organization’s 
life. Doing so enables people to feel like they’re connecting with you in real 
time, which builds trust (and your donor-organization relationship).
Identifying who uses social media 
and what they can do for you
The potential size of the audience currently using social media technologies 
may be a difficult concept to grasp. Millions and millions of users — all over 
the world at this very moment — are trading photos, chatting, and posting 
links to interesting Web sites. And in case you’re thinking social media is 
just for the younger crowd, think again — the number of social media users 
between the ages of 39 and 64 is growing at twice the rate of the 18-and-
younger group.
Although many of the activities Web 2.0 users enjoy are free, statistics show 
that online users are indeed spending money. In 2007, online advertising 
in the United States alone reached $14.6 billion dollars, and online holiday 
purchasing reached an all-time high in 2008 — in spite of the economic down-
turn. Ever-increasing Web traffic shows that people spend a lot of their time 
and attention online, and reports let savvy Web watchers pinpoint interests, 
trends, and the next big thing in online sales.
A report on social media and cause-related marketing released by the Cone 
group (www.coneinc.com/content2601) says that even though 4 out of 
5 social media users interact with companies and causes online, fewer than 
one in five (18 percent) has made a donation using social media tools. The 
report cites lack of trust (Will my donation really go where they say it will go?) 
as one of the key reasons why donors aren’t yet giving in higher numbers.
So what do these statistics mean to you as a fundraiser wanting to har-
ness the power of the social Web? They illustrate that you have an almost-
unlimited audience coming to social networking sites because they want to 

212
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
connect in a fun, interesting, and personalized way and get involved with the 
ideas and communities they connect with.
The power of choice is something that Web 2.0 users and your donors have 
in common. According to the 2009 book Socialnomics: How Social Media 
Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business by Erik Qualman (Wiley), 78 per-
cent of consumers trust peer recommendations, while only 14 percent trust 
advertisements for the same products. For you, this stat means that personal 
stories — and the testimonials of clients you’ve served — will be far more 
powerful than your own marketing copy or block advertisements.
And the fact that friends of friends become fans of your organization will 
carry more weight with social media users than the high-profile board mem-
bers on your board. Your interactions online — the tweets you post, the links 
and notes you add to Facebook, the questions you ask on LinkedIn — will do 
a lot to either bring your friends and fans closer to your organization . . . or 
not. So be friendly, be timely, and give your social media friends something 
to talk about.

media technologies? Check out the books Groundswell: Winning in a World 
Transformed by Social Technologies, by Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff (Harvard 
Business School Press), and Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the 
Way We Live and Do Business by Erik Qualman (Wiley).
Building a Community of 
People Who Care
People have always been social animals, and today they have more things to 
share — and a farther reach — than they’ve ever had before. Social media 
technologies now enable people to connect in real time, on their own terms, 
creating the communities of friends and families they choose. They can con-
nect with the causes they care about and share those causes with others in 
their social networks; in turn, those friends share causes with others in their 
networks — thus, you see the power of social media.
The following sections introduce you to three popular social media networks. 
We encourage you to spend some time online exploring these sites and get-
ting a better feel for how they work.
Feeling all a-Twitter
Twitter is a free microblogging tool (think “little blog”) that enables users to 
share whatever is on their minds at any given time. Twitter essentially asks 

213
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
its users, “What are you doing?” and gives them 140 characters with which 
to respond. The brief responses people leave on Twitter are perfect for text 
messages or Web displays, and they can — and typically do — include links 
to other sites for more information.
Tweeting to bring people closer to the action
How exactly do organizations use Twitter? Well, the idea is to personify your 
organization and keep the people who follow your Twitter feed close to the 
action. So, on your organization’s Twitter feed, you may post a tweet on any 
of the following:
 
✓ A new program you’re introducing
 
✓ A link to a story on your Web site about an event you hosted
 
✓ A call to volunteers for your next social action night
 
✓ An announcement of an exciting award
 
✓ A link to a new research study in your area of service
Twitter has swept like wildfire across the Web 2.0 world, engaging users in 
conversations that bounce back and forth across continents. Countries have 
used Twitter to stage coups; environmental groups have used Twitter to 
create an instant “flash mob” in a public demonstration against global warm-
ing (read the article at www.sltrib.com/news/ci_13065009).
Of course Twitter was in the news when politicians were tweeting during 
President Obama’s 2009 speech on the state of the economy; and Twitter is 
now being used by many newscasters, celebrities, marketing professionals, 
and everyday folks all over the world. The idea that you can share what you 
think, what you do, and what interests you — anywhere, anytime — has cre-
ated a fascinating in-the-moment reporting culture that keeps an on-going, 
worldwide conversation alive and well.
 
You can get up-to-the-minute alerts about the advocacy actions you care 
about in more than 60 social areas, ranging from Africa and AIDS actions to 
youth advocacy, with Twitter Action Pack: www.socialactions.com/
labs/twitter-action-pack.
Twitter users engage each other in real-time conversation by replying 
directly and posting comments in their Twitter feed responses to each other. 
Additionally, Twitter users can tweet about a specific topic by using what’s 
known as a hash tag, which identifies the topic of a post so others can find 
it easily. For example, the hash tag #cop15 enables a user to search for all 
the tweets related to the COP 15 summit on global climate in Copenhagen in 
December 2009.

214
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Putting Twitter to use for your organization
So how will you use Twitter as part of your organization’s fundraising initia-
tive? Twitter gives organizations that work in any kind of advocacy a great 
opportunity to become part of the real conversation in their particular indus-
try areas. To help spread the word about your twitter feed (and to attract 
potential donors and advocates to your cause), post invitations and links to 
follow you on Twitter on your Web site, e-newsletters, and e-mail messages.
 
Not sure what to tweet? Send an e-mail message to your staff members asking 
them what they’re working on today. By choosing what to tweet from different 
aspects of your organization, you broaden the sense of work your organiza-
tion does and help users see into the daily life of your group.
Connecting constituents with LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a global social network that focuses on networking opportuni-
ties for professionals in more than 170 industries in 200 countries. LinkedIn 
includes executives from all Fortune 500 companies and estimates that half of 
the network’s 47 million members live outside the United States.
Getting a feel for tweeting
With the 140-character messages you post on 
Twitter, you have a chance to microblog what’s 
going on with your organization today. In real 
time, you can give subscribers the feeling of 
participating in your agency’s work as well 
as a link back to your site. Here are just a few 
examples of what you can tweet:
 ✓ Getting ready to announce our 2009 
Volunteer of the Year award! Check out our 
Web site later today!
 ✓ This WSJ article on energy efficiency 
quotes one of our staff members.
 ✓ We’re planning our dog wash for next 
Saturday afternoon — sign up on the Web 
site!
Note: Your tweets aren’t just informational — 
you also want people who follow your Twitter 
feed to come back to your site. So don’t forget 
to link any reference to your Web site or other 
relevant sites you mention in your tweets.
The 140-character limitation can be a hindrance 
when you’ve got a really long Web address. You 
can shorten the Web address by using a util-
ity called TinyURL, which is available online at 
http://tinyurl.com. Simply go to the 
site, paste your long Web address in the text 
box, and click the Make Tiny URL! button. You 
can then copy and paste the shorter URL (short 
for Uniform Resource Locator, which means 
“Web address”) into your tweet and send it 
normally.

215
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
The idea driving the success of LinkedIn is the same one that forms the basis 
of any thriving community — that shared knowledge and experience benefit 
every person in a community (whether it be a company, a nonprofit orga-
nization, or a neighborhood). In addition to the one-to-one connections via 
personal networks, LinkedIn includes a groups feature that enables individu-
als, organizations, and businesses to build communities that share articles, 
discussions, polls, presentations, and more.
So how might you use LinkedIn to build awareness of your organization? Here 
are just a few ideas:
 
✓ Create an organizational profile and connect with all your staff, board 
members, committee members, and volunteers.
 
✓ Post information about your programs and services, as well as your 
needs and news.
 
✓ Add a group that discusses key ideas and developments in your area of 
service.
 
✓ Join other groups that serve members in your demographics.
 
✓ Post articles and answer questions about your industry area. (Doing so 
builds your brand and demonstrates your organization’s expertise in 
your service area.)
Like other social networks, LinkedIn is free to join, but it also offers premium 
services — such as member research and targeting — for a fee.
Sharing the love on Facebook
Facebook is the premier social networking site in the world at the moment, 
recently passing the 300-million-member mark, and its basic services are free 
to use.
Facebook users create profiles giving their demographics — their age, loca-
tion, employment, education, marital status, and more — and then they begin 
identifying people they want to “friend” (which has become a verb, by the 
way) as they build their personal networks. Facebook users post photos, 
add links, upload videos, tell others what they’re reading, rate their favorite 
music, and chat in real time with each other. In addition to the dozens of 
applications available within Facebook, developers have created literally 
thousands of add-in applications that offer just about every type of extra 
available in the world of social networking.

216
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Fun is the motivating force on Facebook, and users often send each other 
gifts, take quizzes (like “Which Hobbit are you?”), play games, and watch and 
rate videos. In addition to the lighter side of Facebook, friends and families 
mobilize to join causes they care about — which, as you may have guessed, 
is where you come in.
Facebook enables organizations to create their own pages and build fan 
bases. Similar to a personal account, the organizational page is free and 
includes all the social media features available on other pages. People can 
click a small icon to become “fans” of your organization. Whenever you post 
an update — by adding new content in the form of a new link, photo, video, 
or event to your profile page — your new content becomes visible to all 
your fans by way of their personal news feeds pages. These automatic news 
flashes help keep your organization in the minds of your public — and build 
on your “friendly” brand at the same time.
So what can you do in the way of fundraising with a Facebook page? Here are 
some ideas to get you started:
 
✓ Post your mission, Web site, and programs.
 
✓ Add photos of your staff or facilities, as well as photos of your programs 
in action if that’s appropriate.
 
✓ Add videos of staff members or recent programs.
 
✓ Create an events page to publicize upcoming events.
 
✓ Answer questions from fans and donors.
 
✓ Add a Causes module to raise funds online.
 
✓ Send updates to all your fans.
 
Be sure to get permission — in writing — before posting the photographs of 
any of your staff members, constituents, or volunteers. You can find standard 
model release forms online at the American Society of Media Photographers 
Web site, http://asmp.org.
 
Remember that fundraising is all about making connections. Posting informa-
tion about your organization on Facebook and other social media networks 
allows you to connect with a wide array of people across the globe that you 
simply can’t reach any other way.
In addition to the basic updating features Facebook gives to organizations, it 
also offers you the ability to target specific groups of your users. (This ser-
vice requires an upgrade on your account, though, which incurs a cost.)

217
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
If you choose to expand into the for-fee realm, you can also send messages 
to all Facebook users and create advertisements that display along the right 
side of Facebook users’ pages. The ads that appear on users’ pages are tar-
geted to the specific demographic information in the users’ profiles, so your 
chances of getting your animal rights’ organization in front of animal lovers 
are pretty good.
 
More than 1.5 million pieces of content (links, stories, blog posts, notes, 
photos, and so on) are shared on Facebook every single day. If you post a 
great story on your Web site and then add it as a note on your Facebook page, 
your fans may just share it with others, who may share it with others . . . and 
so on and so forth as your message spreads across the Web.
Understanding What Your 
Social Media Users Want
The three popular social media sites that we profile earlier in this chapter — 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook — offer different goals, tools, and audiences. 
And although all social media enthusiasts have something in common — the 
desire to connect with others online — before you start networking away, you 
need to determine which social media network offers you the best chances of 
reaching your particular donor group. Keep in mind these general guidelines as 
to the main audiences each network attracts:
 
✓ Twitter appeals to high-tech audiences who are always connected via 
computer or cellphone. They love news, trade the latest stories, and 
share social commentary and advocacy ideas.
 
✓ LinkedIn is directed toward the professional crowd. LinkedIn focuses on 
business and organizational networking, developing expertise in indus-
try areas, and showcasing projects, programs, and more.
 
✓ Facebook is all about building relationships, having fun, and spread-
ing the word. The overall energy is creative and engaging. Although 
Facebook originally started for the college-age crowd, the average 
Facebook user joining today is older. Still, fun, friendliness, and high 
energy are the order of the day on Facebook.
Regardless of which group they belong to, users of social media have similar 
attitudes and goals when they connect with your organization. Read on for 
some insights that can help you make the most of these relationships.

218
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Visibility and voice: Here we are!
Users of social media are drawn to online networks because they want to 
belong to a community — and they want to be able to choose the groups and 
individuals with whom they connect.
 
When your organization gets started in social media, remember that your 
potential donors want to be able to share what they care about, so ask ques-
tions, post polls, and offer ways for your fans and friends to get involved on 
your social media pages.
When users post comments on your social media page or send you mes-
sages, be sure to answer promptly. Long delays (days or weeks) indicate a 
rarely tended site in social media, and, in the quick-moving social universe, 
your silence usually leads your fans to forget you fast.
Engagement and opportunity: Let me help
Social media users are interested in connecting for fun and profit, but many 
people are also looking for ways to add purpose and meaning to what they 
do. Thus, this group of online users is a prime audience for your causes and 
announcements. You can use your social network to post the following:
 
✓ Calls for volunteers
 
✓ Notices about new volunteer trainings
 
✓ Invitations to public events
 
✓ Notices about volunteer awards
 
✓ Calendar items for your upcoming volunteer opportunities
 
✓ Open committee positions
 
✓ Links to stories about needs in your industry area
The freedom to choose: I want it my way
Web 2.0 tools enable users to pick and choose the kinds of gadgets and wid-
gets they want in their social media toolboxes. And social networking tech-
nologies enable users to choose whom they want to befriend and whom they 
want to ignore.

219
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
Similarly, social media users can choose the groups they join, the links they 
share, the photos they post, and the level to which others can see the con-
tent they add. You can invite these users to join your Facebook fan page, 
follow you on Twitter, or join your network on LinkedIn, but the choice to 
follow you online is ultimately the donors’.
 
Be sure to give your potential donors all the choices you can when it comes to 
managing your social media interactions. Let them opt in to your group when 
they’re ready, invite them to participate in the way that fits them best, and 
don’t be surprised when your donors show considerable autonomy and inde-
pendence. If they share your story and further your links — and build goodwill 
for your organization in the process — they’re doing more for your organiza-
tion than you can do alone.
Taking the Plunge into Social Media
So you’ve decided to give the social media scene a whirl, and you’ve signed 
up your organization for Facebook and Twitter accounts. Now what?
First, let all your current supporters know you’ve got a presence on these sites. 
Publicize it on your Web page and in your e-mails or e-newsletters. They’ll 
friend you, their friends will see the connection and perhaps join your network, 
and then you’ll be on your way to building a larger circle of supporters.
The next thing to do is incorporate these outlets into your overall communi-
cation strategy. The following sections show you how you can communicate 
a message across various platforms, evaluate whether your social media 
efforts are paying off, and ensure the security of your online users’ informa-
tion so that they’ll continue to connect with you and your cause.
Making sure your messages work together
As the social media field expands, both tools and users are becoming more 
savvy. Today you can publish a new blog post and have it appear automati-
cally on your Facebook page. Similarly, you can connect your Twitter account 
to Facebook so that your Facebook status updates go to Twitter and your 
Twitter updates post as notes on Facebook.
Are you confused yet?

Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
The key is to think through what you communicate in terms of holistic mes-
saging and then to choose the channel you want to use to deliver the mes-
sage. For example, if you’re announcing a new scholarship program your 
organization is offering, you may communicate your message in the following 
ways:
 
✓ Send a press release to media sources.
 
✓ Post an announcement on your Web site. (Check out Chapter 16 for 
more on connecting with donors via your Web site.)
 
✓ Send an e-mail message announcing the program to donors who may be 
interested. (Go to Chapter 15 to find out more about getting the most 
out of e-mail.)
 
✓ Create a brochure that explains the details of the program.
 
✓ Post a note on your Facebook page.
 
✓ Tweet about the new program with a link back to your Web site 
announcement.
 
✓ Add a post on LinkedIn, inviting network members to ask questions or 
post comments.
 
It’s okay to pick and choose the outlets you want to use for the messages you 
send. If you feel that a particular message won’t be right for a certain social 
media audience, feel free to skip that post. Flexibility — not rigidity — is the 
name of the game.
Tracking and evaluating results
Especially when you’re just getting started in social media, keep track of 
everything you can for the various tools you select. Watch the patterns of 
growth from week to week. At least monthly, take inventory of the following 
numbers:
 
✓ Number of fans on your Facebook page
 
✓ Number of times you’ve posted links, photos, videos, or updates
 
✓ Number of LinkedIn members in your network and/or group
 
✓ Number of links you’ve added, posts you’ve created, or questions you’ve 
asked or answered
 
✓ Number of subscribers following you on Twitter
 
✓ Number of updates you’ve posted on Twitter
 
✓ Number of direct replies and conversations you’ve had

221
 Chapter 14: Social Networking: What’s the Connection for Your Organization?
 
✓ Number of people who have been drawn to your Web site through your 
various social media sites
 
✓ Number of donors who are now communicating directly with you 
because of your social media sites
After you tally up the numbers, identify one or two items you’d like to 
explore more fully in the coming month.
 
Don’t forget to share your successes with your board! Knowing that your 
group is an active part of the social media movement is a source of pride — 
and relevancy — for everyone in your organization.
Creating credibility and security 
in social media
When social media was in its infancy, not long ago, many people were wary of 
the new technologies. Can social media be trusted? Are the organizations online 
trustworthy? How do donors know that the causes they support are authentic?
With the growth of social media, your organization will likely seem hip and in 
tune with the times when you launch your new tools. However, it’s important 
to address any security concerns your donors may have.
In some ways, the social media networks themselves have taken steps to 
ensure authenticity among their users. For example, the Facebook Causes 
module requires that nonprofits be 501(c)(3) organizations listed with 
GuideStar.org, the database from which Facebook pulls all its Causes data.
Of course, you need to take your own steps to assure your donors that you’re 
a legitimate organization that uses its time, energy, and donations to do 
good. On all your online sites, be sure to spell out for your donors who you 
are, what you do, and how they can find out more about you. If you plan to 
use your social media accounts to accept donations (as opposed to sending 
people back to your organization’s Web site for online donations), use an 
entity like Facebook Causes that’s set up to ensure a secure environment.
 
More than 30 million Facebook members currently use the Facebook Causes 
application to donate to their favorite nonprofit organizations all over the 
world. The Causes application is a Verified Application that passes Facebook’s 
muster for trustworthy applications. After your organization is set up on 
Causes, your Facebook fans and friends can add the Causes application to 
their Facebook pages and choose your organization as the beneficiary of the 
donations they collect. Donations collected through Facebook Causes are 
processed by Network for Good, and payments are sent to the nonprofit on 
the 15th of each month. To find out more about Facebook Causes, visit www.
facebook.com/causes.

The Big Dilemma: To Ask or Not to Ask?
As you use social media in your fundraising efforts, you’ll eventually come up 
against the big question: Should you use social media to ask for donations?
We debated this topic, at first wondering whether making a real “Ask” on 
Facebook would be a violation of social media etiquette or an unwanted dis-
ruption in the give-and-take community that social media groups are creating 
(check out Chapter 10 for more on “the Ask”). The Facebook Causes applica-
tion enables organizations to raise funds in a fairly low-visibility way, but is 
this application enough to get a return on investment for the time and effort 
you put into establishing and maintaining your social media presence?
We concluded that you can find the best answer for these questions within 
your own organization, donor base, and comfort level. Before you go looking 
for the answer, however, you may want to consider the possibility that your 
feeling about asking for donations on social media may have everything to do 
with your own money attitude.
To illustrate this point, here’s a real-life story: John has served for many 
years on the board of The Garden, a church community that offers an alter-
native style of worship. The pastor and music director didn’t want to ask 
the small congregation for funds, so week after week they sat buckets by the 
doors for a freewill offering. After some time, the community’s leaders real-
ized that these small donations weren’t going to keep the church doors open, 
but they still didn’t want to ask for money — they had both had previous 
church experiences in which fundraising was a point of pain. One day in the 
wake of 9/11, two firefighters visited the church and asked for permission to 
pass around a boot to collect funds for the spouses and children of firefight-
ers who died in the Twin Towers. That Sunday, for the first time ever, the 
music director stood in front of the church and made an eloquent appeal for 
donations on behalf of the firefighters’ families. That day the leaders’ belief 
about asking for donations changed, and since that time, the church has 
grown and matured and is now working on building an endowment.
The moral here is listen to your heart and mind, talk to your board, and hear 
what your donors have to say. If you decide to go for the gold in social media, 
have fun with it — do a 12-hour fundraising drive and post every donation 
(with thanks and dedications) on your Twitter feed; create your own informal 
fundraising auction with Facebook gifts; design your own online event that 
makes the most of all the social technologies at your disposal.
 
Just remember that when everything’s said and done — no matter how much 
flash and fun your social media sites may offer — fundraising is still all about 
the relationships you build online, offline, and in the hearts and minds of 
everyone affiliated with your cause.

I
f you haven’t yet jumped with both feet into e-mail communications, 
you’re missing a great — and inexpensive — way to get the word out 
about your organization and stay in touch with your donors. Just a few years 
ago, people primarily used e-mail for person-to-person contact, but today 
organizations are using e-mail for a whole variety of contacts — from gen-
eral communications to newsletters to event announcements to fundraising 
approaches.
In this chapter, we show you the benefits of using e-mail to communicate 
with your donors. We also offer suggestions on what topics lend themselves 
to quick e-mails, who should receive your messages, and how to steer clear 
of e-mistakes. Finally, we take a close look at e-newsletters and the benefits 
they can offer your organization.
Making the Case for E-Mail
Of all the various approaches to donor contact, e-mail comes with the lowest 
cost and the smallest time commitment from you. With e-mail, you can send — 
with the click of a mouse — a friendly, engaging, well-written message to the 
thousands of donors you want to invite to contribute to your annual fund. And 
you can do so for free. Here are some of our favorite reasons for making the 
switch from print to e-mail for the bulk of your outgoing communications:

224
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
✓ E-mail can be personable. E-mail offers you an immediate way to reach 
your donors in the way they’re most likely to receive it. You can person-
alize e-mail messages so that they include donors’ names, favorite proj-
ects, and other relevant information — all of which goes toward building 
trust with your donors.
 
 Depending on the age of your board members, some of them may feel 
e-mail communication is too impersonal for fundraising. Although this is 
true when you reach the more interactive level of relationship building 
with major donors, a well-written e-mail message targeted to a specific 
audience can attract many small donors with little effort.
 
✓ E-mail saves time. The time you take to write the e-mail message is the 
biggest segment of time you have to invest in this type of communica-
tion. Instead of writing a dozen different letters for countless different 
donors or audiences or creating a direct mail appeal and spending the 
morning at the printer while you print, fold, stuff, and stamp the enve-
lopes, you can create just one e-mail and send it an infinite number of 
times.
 
✓ E-mail is direct. Direct mail pieces take time, money, and effort to put 
together, and then, after you finally get them ready to send, you have to 
wait for the pieces to be delivered. Statistics also show that a very slim 
percentage of direct mail brings any kind of suitable return. Because 
e-mail messages can be produced quickly, sent immediately, and 
received almost instantly, they’re actually more direct than direct mail.
 
✓ E-mail is low-cost. Chances are you can send e-mail directly from the 
fundraising or donor management software you now use to keep track 
of your donors and their contributions. If your software doesn’t have 
this capacity, you can piece it together on your own by using a spread-
sheet and your favorite e-mail utility, or you can subscribe to an e-mail 
service like Exact Target (email.exacttarget.com), which enables 
you to create, send, and manage all e-mail communication sent from 
your organization.
 
✓ E-mail is customizable. Five or ten years ago, e-mail was pretty utilitar-
ian; you could send or receive basic text with perhaps a link or two, but 
that was about it. Today e-mail can be customized any number of ways. 
You can add photos, formats, background images, and more. You can 
even include your organization’s logo and a Donate Now! button that 
takes donors to your Web site, where they can donate online with their 
credit cards.
 
 Some e-mail programs block images in an effort to protect users from 
unwanted spam, so make sure the text of your message introduces your 
organization and lets recipients know that you’re legitimate.

225
 Chapter 15: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters
 
✓ E-mail is trackable. A big plus to using e-mail over direct mail is that you 
can easily determine who opens your e-mail messages, what your recipi-
ents like about your messages, and which links they click on to find out 
more about you — a lot of information for a single electronic transac-
tion. E-mail management programs allow you to keep an eye on the 
results of your e-mail campaigns so you can find out what your donors 
respond to, which can help you fine-tune your communications so you 
can do even better the next time.
Being Smart about E-Mail Campaigns
The average e-mail user today receives approximately 100 messages a day, 
many of which are spam, a few of which are from family, and a small number 
of which may be related to bills or purchases. How many messages do you 
receive from nonprofit organizations? Chances are you get newsletters 
you’ve signed up for and receive e-mail messages with program updates from 
the groups you follow regularly.
How can you be successful in grabbing a bit of your donor’s attention when 
so many groups are vying for it? The short answer is simple:
 
✓ Send your e-mail to the right people.
 
✓ Ask for what you need and what you think your donors can give.
 
✓ Make the message personal for the donor.
The following sections cover each of these points in more detail to help you 
make the most of your e-mail messages.
Figuring out who should 
receive your e-mails
The more strategically you can target the recipients of your e-mail messages, 
the better. For example, choosing just the right group to receive information 
about the new naming opportunities for the campus library is one way to 
make sure your e-mail campaign is successful. But how do you pick out just 
the right people from your huge list of donors? You need to do a little slicing 
and dicing of your donor list.
 
If you don’t know how to slice and dice your list to create small groups of 
targeted donors, contact your software vendor and ask someone to walk you 
through the process. (Depending on the complexity of your software, you may 
be able to figure out how to do so yourself by searching online for tutorials or 
reading the program’s help system.)

226
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
When you slice and dice your list, you create a series of smaller lists that 
each focus on a specific group. For example, you may create donor sub-
groups from your overall list that look something like the following:
 
✓ Donors under 30 years of age
 
✓ Major givers ($5,000 and above)
 
✓ Donors who have given to specific programs
 
✓ Donors who receive your planned-giving newsletter
 
✓ Donors who have served on one of your organization’s committees in 
the past
 
✓ Donors who are candidates for endowment or capital campaigns
 
✓ Donors from different zip codes
 
✓ Donors who don’t have e-mail
 
✓ Donors with specific interests
Use these donor sublists to pinpoint the donors you want to include in par-
ticular e-mail campaigns. For example, if you’re starting an e-mail campaign 
to raise funds for your new literacy program, focus on sending your e-mail 
messages to the donors who have previously shown interest in education 
and literacy.
 
Hopefully, you’ve been gathering e-mail addresses for your donors for some 
time, but even if you have, continue to be vigilant in collecting new addresses. 
Request e-mail addresses on items like tickets, sign-in sheets, order forms, and 
volunteer applications. You can never have too many e-mail addresses!
Knowing what to say
Your e-mail campaign should be as well thought out as any direct mail cam-
paign you send to donors. Though it may seem easy to click the Send button 
after you have a list of people to e-mail, you can’t simply dash off an e-mail in 
three or four minutes. You need to consider the e-mail’s content, strategize 
its purpose, and plan to follow up on this particular e-mail. Plus, you don’t 
want to make a careless, high-cost e-mail mistake, a topic we cover in the 
“Avoiding E-Mail Mistakes” section later in this chapter.
 
Consider your e-mail’s purpose and desired results before you sit down at the 
keyboard. Some organizations use e-mail to solicit donations, others use it to 
maintain donor relationships, and still others use it to find and interact with 
volunteers. The possibilities of e-mail are really endless, but whatever your 
reason is for starting an e-mail campaign, understand what you want to get out 
of it before you even start composing your first e-mail.

227
 Chapter 15: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters
Using e-mail to get a donation
The most obvious use of e-mail for a nonprofit organization is to try to raise 
money. You can make it easy for people to donate to your organization and 
encourage them to do so by incorporating some of the following techniques 
in your e-mail campaign:
 
✓ Include a link in your e-mail. Providing a link in your e-mail gives recipi-
ents an easy way to go to your Web site or to an e-mail form to reply to 
your message. You can even include a secure link to a page where recipi-
ents can make a payment right on the spot, either through your site or 
through a third-party payment vendor such as PayPal.
 
✓ Attach to the e-mail message a printable form that people can print 
out and mail in with a check. Consider using a format such as PDF, 
which anybody using Adobe Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com/
products/acrobat/main.html) can open. Be aware, however, that 
some e-mail spam filters remove e-mail attachments, and users are coun-
seled not to open attachments on e-mails sent from senders they don’t 
recognize. For this reason, you may want to send attachments only to 
those donors you contact regularly or those on your opt-in list.
 
✓ Use graphic images in your e-mail to drive your message home. Show 
a picture of your new building, include an image of a group of distressed 
teens whom you’ve helped with your programs, or add a graph showing 
the positive results of your efforts over the past year. Remember, how-
ever, that some e-mail filters block images, so be sure to fully describe 
the image in the surrounding text.
The benefits of opt-in lists
One alternative to using a list of donors you 
already know is to buy or build opt-in lists for 
your e-mail campaigns. People on opt-in lists 
have asked for information from your organiza-
tion. Not only do these people make up a richer 
potential mine of donor dollars, but they’re also 
less likely to be annoyed when you communi-
cate with them.
You can come by opt-in lists by doing the 
following:
 ✓ Set up an opt-in function on your Web 
site. When people register on your Web 
site, they may indicate that they’re open to 
receiving information from you.
 ✓ Share opt-in lists with other organizations. 
You may have a relationship with another 
organization in which its members have 
agreed to receive communications from 
related organizations; as a result, the orga-
nization shares its addresses with you.
 ✓ Buy an opt-in list from another group or opt-in 
list vendor to ensure that you have e-mail 
addresses that will go to live recipients.
Regardless of how people on opt-in lists came 
to be on those lists, they’ve somehow indicated 
that they’re open to receiving communications 
from you, which makes them prime recipients 
for your e-mail campaigns.

228
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
✓ Consider asking your e-mail recipients to forward the donor mailing 
to other people they think may be interested. E-mail is easy to forward, 
and it’s a free way to expand your message to other potential donors 
you don’t even know yet.
 
You can also set up an automated confirmation that sends an instant e-mail 
receipt to any donor who donates online. The receipt serves as a tax record 
for the donor, but, more importantly, it can include an instant thank-you that 
makes your donors feel appreciated.
Using e-mail to build your donor relationship
E-mail may be a fast and easy way to communicate with your donors, but you 
need to know when enough is enough. Don’t constantly hit people with e-mail 
requests for money. Consider alternating fundraising messages with useful 
or interesting information about your group or your cause to help build your 
donor relationships; for example:
 
✓ Let donors in on upcoming events or changes in your organization.
 
✓ Note milestones in donors’ giving levels and thank them for helping.
 
✓ Provide a case study of a specific way your organization’s efforts (and 
those of the donors) helped a person or group.
 
✓ Share a scanned thank-you note from someone your organization 
helped (a child your organization saved from homelessness or abuse, 
for example).
 
✓ Invite donors to share their thoughts about an upcoming program.
 
✓ Recognize donors and volunteers who helped bring success to a specific 
program or event.
 
✓ Acknowledge a special gift or all the people who gave in a particular 
month.
Using e-mail to find volunteers
When you’re trying to find ways to use e-mail in your organization, don’t 
forget about your volunteers — you know, that important group of souls who 
give to you in the form of time, passion, and perhaps even money. Sending an 
e-mail thanking your volunteers for their efforts, informing them of achieve-
ments, and singling out people for their contributions is easy and inexpensive 
to do.
If you have a big initiative coming up that needs a lot of volunteers, try send-
ing a sign-up e-mail to past volunteers and people who have expressed an 
interest in volunteering for your organization. You may be surprised by the 
response you get!

229
 Chapter 15: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters
Writing an e-mail that gets the 
results you’re looking for
No matter which donor group you’re sending to or what your overall mes-
sage is, a well-written e-mail typically includes the following:
 
✓ A clear and concise subject line: Many people decide whether to read an 
e-mail simply by looking at the subject line. Use something like “Find out 
how you can save a child from abuse.” Be specific, and be compelling — 
and make sure your subject line somehow says who you are so your mes-
sage doesn’t get caught in spam filters.
 
✓ An identifier that says who you and your organization are upfront: 
People want to know who’s talking to them before they’re receptive to 
the message. State your name, position, and organization at the begin-
ning of your message so your recipients don’t have any time to wonder 
whether the e-mail’s legitimate.
 
✓ A focused message: People usually read e-mails on their computer screens; 
they don’t print them out and read them on paper. Keep your message 
crisp, straightforward, and organized to keep your reader reading.
 
✓ An explanation of any attachments: Don’t bury an important part of 
your message in an attachment people may or may not read. Also, be 
sure to assure your recipients that what your attachments contain is 
legitimate — otherwise, they may be afraid to open them because they 
may contain viruses.
 
One final note about how to write your e-mails: E-mail isn’t a formal type of 
communication. Busy people, who want their information fast and to the 
point, read it on the fly. Don’t put people off by having an overly practiced or 
wordy style. Be sincere about your message, don’t stray from its main point, 
and make your reader feel comfortable with your communication.
 
Don’t forget to track the results of all your e-mail campaigns. Assign a cam-
paign code of some sort to each e-mail so you can attribute questions or 
donations coming in as a result of a particular e-mail to a specific campaign. In 
doing so, you can identify which campaigns are most successful and improve 
your content for future mailings. You can buy e-mail campaign management 
software, such as e-Campaign from LmhSoft (www.lmhsoft.com), or down-
load the free Email Marketing Director from Arial Software (www.arial
software.com) to help you keep track of your e-mail campaign’s results. For 
a monthly fee, e-mail services, such as Vertical Response (www.vertical
response.com) and Exact Target (email.exacttarget.com), also help 
you design your e-mail messages with templates and design tools.

Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Avoiding E-Mail Mistakes
In the same way that a telephone call can be either good or evil in the recipi-
ent’s eyes (a call from Uncle Charlie — how nice; another telemarketer at 
dinner — what an annoyance!), an e-mail can be either a welcome communi-
cation or a complete nuisance. So before you send a mass e-mail, think about 
what you want to say, whom you want to contact, and how your recipients 
may perceive your communication. The following sections help you avoid the 
pitfalls of e-mail.
Don’t use e-mail to spam
Spamming is the practice of sending out a lot — we’re talking hundreds or 
thousands — of unsolicited e-mails in a hit-or-miss approach to connect 
with potential donors. Folks who receive spam at the very least delete it; at 
the most, they determine never to do anything to help an organization that 
encroaches on their privacy and inundates them with unwanted messages.
The alternative to spamming is sending e-mails only to people whom you 
identify using a donor list of your own or an opt-in list. (We discuss opt-in 
lists in the sidebar “The benefits of opt-in lists.”)
Don’t be a sloppy e-mailer
E-mail may be a quick and easy way to dash off an informal note to a col-
league, but when you use e-mail to communicate with a donor, you can’t 
afford to make your communication sloppy or full of mistakes. Sending a 
badly phrased or unclear e-mail is a waste of your recipient’s time — and a 
ding to your professional reputation. What’s worse, sending e-mail full of mis-
spellings and grammatical errors sends a message about the caliber of your 
organization.
 
Never treat donor e-mail — whether it’s going to a single person or hundreds 
of potential donors — with any less care than you do your organization’s bro-
chure, annual report, or paper-based mailings.
 
Here are some e-mail tips to keep in mind as you get ready to write an e-mail 
to one or more donors:
 
✓ Spell check, spell check, spell check.
 
✓ Ask someone else to read important messages before you click Send.
 
✓ Save a copy of your e-mail content so you can reuse it later.

231
 Chapter 15: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters
Understanding the Power 
of E-Newsletters
Similar to the explosion of nonprofit Web sites in operation today, e-newsletters 
are now all the rage. Organizations have discovered that it’s possible (and 
affordable!) to create high-quality newsletters with photos, fonts, colors, and 
more and make them available to donors in electronic format. This electronic 
option, which is typically informational rather than promotional, saves nonprof-
its a huge amount of money in print production costs and staff time.
Include a sign-up option on your Web site so interested people can sign up 
to receive your e-newsletter regularly — weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quar-
terly. You also need to provide a mechanism for people to unsubscribe if 
they want to do so.
The following sections help you figure out what to include in your newsletter, 
how to put it together, and how to distribute it.
Catering to your donors’ interests
Be sure that your e-newsletter is interesting to your donors. Provide informa-
tion about your group’s activities, but also give your donors information on 
general trends in your area of service, information about what other groups 
are doing, events of interest, and so on.
For example, if you’re an animal rights’ group, don’t just tell your subscrib-
ers again and again about your group and its mission — if you do, your 
donors will get bored fast. Sure, include information about your group, but 
also include pictures of pets available for adoption at the local animal shel-
ter, information on the pet parade coming up at Halloween in a nearby city, 
grooming tips for housebound cats, and a recipe for healthy dog biscuits. 
Your donors’ interests include your group and its activities, but they’re more 
likely to enjoy your newsletter if you address their broader interests, as well.
Creating your e-newsletter
You can create your own e-newsletter in your favorite word processor or 
desktop publishing program and then save it as a PDF that you can e-mail 
to donors. Alternately, you can use an e-newsletter service like Constant 
Contact (www.constantcontact.com) or Exact Target (www.exact
target.com), both of which provide easy-to-use Web-based interfaces into 
which you can enter your content. You create the newsletter in HTML format, 
and the service tracks the results of your e-newsletter campaign.

232
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
Regardless of how you create your e-newsletter, follow these tips to design an 
effective one:
 
✓ Create an informative header. Include information such as the news-
letter name, your organization name and logo, the date, subscription 
details (such as how new readers can subscribe to the newsletter), and 
contact information.
 
✓ Use a typeface that’s easy on the eyes. Verdana, for example, was 
specifically designed for Web documents because it’s easy to read 
on-screen.
 
✓ Use headlines effectively. Grab the reader’s attention with your head-
lines, but also make it clear what the article is about. Effective headlines 
save people time, and people value their time and expect you to do the 
same.
 
✓ Add graphics and color for interest. Whether you incorporate a visually 
appealing border, photograph, or chart, use a mix of visuals and colors 
to make your e-newsletter more attractive and interesting.
 
✓ Provide links to other resources. Links can take people to your Web 
site where they can find out more about your organization’s mission, to 
other Web sites where they can look further into the topic of the article, 
or to a donation payment form, which they can use to make an online 
donation or to send a donation in the mail.
 
Even though you don’t print it out, an e-newsletter is still a newsletter. Rules 
about using a compelling lead paragraph to put the important information 
right upfront and answering key questions like who, what, when, where, and 
why still apply in writing your article content just as they do in any form of 
journalism.
Adding multimedia pizzazz
More organizations are including links to videos or are embedding video, 
audio, or animation content in their e-mail or e-newsletter communications. 
People tend to listen to or watch multimedia content with great interest 
because sound and images can sell an idea where words fall short. Do you 
have a short video of your clients receiving help from some of your volun-
teers or an arts performance that your group sponsors? Can you provide an 
animation explaining the scientific ins and outs of how your group is working 
to improve the ecosystem? If so, put a link to your video in your e-newsletter

 Chapter 15: Getting the Most from E-Mail and E-Newsletters
Automating e-newsletter delivery
Delivering an e-newsletter is as easy as sending e-mail. But to effectively use 
an e-newsletter as a promotional tool, you need to get a bit more sophisti-
cated in your delivery methods. In other words, don’t just attach your news-
letter as a PDF to an e-mail and forward it to a hundred different people.
The same software packages and online services that help you design 
e-newsletters also typically provide tools to set up and manage delivery of 
your e-newsletters. These management tools may include the following:
 
✓ Options for subscribing and unsubscribing
 
✓ Ability to personalize the e-newsletter, which allows you to include a 
greeting to the recipient by name in the body of your newsletter
 
✓ Delivery set up that may allow you to send as many as 20,000 messages 
an hour
 
✓ Verification of e-mail addresses, which is useful because sometimes 
people subscribe with phony e-mail addresses
 
✓ Management of e-mail lists with import and export features, which 
allow you to import subscriber lists you keep in external programs like 
Microsoft Excel
 
✓ Tracking features that show how many people opened or clicked on 
links in your newsletter
Some useful e-newsletter tools and services include Exact Target (www.
exacttarget.com), eNewsletterPro (www.eNewsletterpro.com), and 
eNewsBuilder (www.enewsbuilder.com).
 
Trying to build your subscriber list? Add a link to your newsletter subscrip-
tion form at the bottom of each and every e-mail message you send. For wider 
exposure, get your e-newsletter posted in e-newsletter directories such as 
EzineSearch (www.ezinesearch.com).
Keep ’em coming back
Always include a link to your organization’s Web site, or even several links 
to different areas of your site related to certain stories, in your e-newsletter. 
After all, bringing people to your Web site allows you to tell more stories, 
point them to donation forms, offer volunteer sign-up forms, or provide more 
information on your services or activities.

234
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Remember to publicize other ways donors can stay in touch with you and 
keep in sync with new developments in your organization. If you have a 
Facebook page, a Twitter feed, or a LinkedIn group, be sure to feature those 
links and logos prominently in your e-newsletter. Doing so lets donors know 
they have additional choices for staying in touch with you, and it builds your 
social media audience while continuing to get the word out about your orga-
nization. (See Chapter 14 for more about these social networking groups.)

▶ Taking advantage of online donations
S
uppose that this afternoon a friend told you about a great new organi-
zation with a mission that sounds exciting. You want to find out more. 
What’s the first thing you do?
Look for the organization on the Web, right? Most people have figured out 
that the fastest way to get basic information about anything and anyone is 
to do a quick Internet search. The results you receive will vary because of 
the vast number of sites out there that may in some way fit the phrase you 
entered for the search, but you’re likely to find at least one or two links worth 
exploring in that first page of results.
When your organization shows up in other people’s search results, a door to 
a world full of potential donors is opened — and, if your Web site is set up to 
accept donations — those donors may even make contributions right there 
on your site. Lucky for you, the Web offers a low-cost way to gain visibility 
with people who care about the work you do. This chapter is all about what 
today’s Web offers nonprofit organizations who want to build visibility for 
their cause, attract supporters, and — hopefully — raise funds online.
Seeing How a Web Site 
Helps with Fundraising
Today every nonprofit organization needs a Web site. The Web today is simi-
lar to the phone book of yesterday; people look up your organization online 
to make sure you’re legitimate. Some potential donors hear about your cause 

236
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
from a friend or see your Web address on one of your publications. Others 
hear about you through word of mouth and use a search engine to find you. 
Still others may benefit from your services, hear about an upcoming fundrais-
ing event, or discover your Facebook page. No matter how potential donors 
hear about you, if they’re curious enough to want to find out more about you, 
your Web site is the first place they’ll go.
 
Here are some of the ways the Web is being used in fundraising today:
 
✓ According to a study done by the Center on Philanthropy, 3 percent of 
all donations in 2007 were given online.
 
✓ The average gift for online donations is still small (between $50 and 
$250), but online donors often give to other campaigns, as well.
 
✓ Nonprofit organizations use orchestrated online efforts — through Web 
donations, fundraising e-mail newsletters, and social media causes — to 
offer donors a variety of ways to give.
 
Depending on the audience you serve and what you feel they expect from 
your site, you may not have to design a site that has a lot of bells and whistles. 
What are the basics your site visitors want to see? For starters, include your 
organization’s history, mission, board members, address, staff, services and 
programs, and contact information. Sprinkle the site liberally with photos 
that show what great work you do and how you impact people’s lives. You 
should also include information that clearly spells out how visitors can donate 
and whether you accept online donations, or provide an e-mail address that 
donors can use to request more information. For more information about 
setting up your site to accept online donations, see the section “Collecting 
Donations Online” later in this chapter.
Putting Your Web Site to Work 
for Your Organization
Your Web site can be as simple or as flashy as you want to make it. You can 
update it once a day or once a week. It can give a complete picture of your 
organization or it can provide just the basics. The important thing is to get 
something out on the Web that tells people around the world that you exist 
and gives them what they need to know in order to get a good picture of the 
type of impact you make in the world.
We’re guessing that your organization probably already has a Web site, so, in 
the following sections, we help you evaluate your site so you know whether 
you’re getting the most benefit from it. We also tell you how your Web site 
can show the public that you’re serious about your mission.

237
 Chapter 16: Ramping Up Your Web Site
 
If you don’t yet have a Web site, you don’t have to pay exorbitant Web site 
development fees to create a professional-looking site. Check with your board 
members, volunteer corps, or staff members to find someone with Web exper-
tise who can assist you. If no one with Web experience steps forward, con-
sider researching free site hosts like Microsoft Office Online. This free 
Web-hosting tool enables you to develop a low- or no-cost site that shares 
your organization’s story in a professional, engaging way. Or pick up Creating 
Web Pages For Dummies, 9th Edition, by Bud E. Smith (Wiley) to try your hand 
at Web design.
 
Whether you design your own page or not, you have to pay someone to host 
it. Hosting services provide lots of useful tools to get your site up and running, 
and the cost isn’t always too high. Visit www.web-page-hosting-review.
com to get an overview of some of the many services out there.
Evaluating your Web site
If you haven’t taken a look at your organization’s Web site lately, now’s the 
time to do so. Like it or not, your Web site is likely making a first impression 
with potential donors all over the world. Is your site making a positive first 
impression or a negative one? Is your mission clear? A great nonprofit Web 
site does the following:
 
✓ Introduces the organization clearly and concisely
 
✓ Is visually inviting and easy to navigate
 
✓ Includes real stories of real people
 
✓ Is updated regularly with fresh content
 
✓ Lists board members and states the organization’s mission
 
✓ May include video or audio clips of clients or staff
 
✓ Offers visitors the ability to sign up for free e-newsletters
 
✓ Lets visitors download information such as brochures, annual reports, 
newsletters, and more
 
✓ Includes links to your pages on social media networks like Facebook, 
Twitter, and LinkedIn
Use Table 16-1 to help you identify ways you can improve your current site.

Ideas for How You Can 
Improve Your Site
Has your site been updated within a 
month?
Does your site include stories of 
people served by your organization?
Do you post photos on your 
Web site?
Do you list your board on your site?
Do you offer donors the ability to 
donate online?
Can donors sign up for an 
e-newsletter on your site?
Do you provide a way for visitors to 
volunteer?
Do you include links to social media 
tools on your site?
Are your annual report and Form 990 
available on your site?
Do you provide existing volunteers 
resources on your site (for example, 
service schedules and opportunities 
for upcoming events)?
Do you have an organizational wish 
list for in-kind donations and 
services?
Building credibility for your organization
Having a Web site is a big step toward establishing your organization’s cred-
ibility. When potential donors can find you online, you’re well on your way to 
building your organization’s legitimacy in your donors’ eyes.
 
The Web is a big place, and most donors know that appearances can be 
deceiving. Small, kitchen-table nonprofits can look as big as national organiza-
tions online when they have talented Web designers at the helm.

239
 Chapter 16: Ramping Up Your Web Site
How can you let your potential donors know that you’re a reputable organiza-
tion? Here are a few tried-and-true ideas:
 
✓ List your mission, history, and board where visitors can find the infor-
mation easily.
 
✓ Provide visitors with an e-mail address they can send questions and 
comments to (and be sure to respond to messages quickly).
 
✓ Display your organization’s physical address on every page of your Web 
site (putting it at the bottom of the page is fine).
 
✓ Make your Form 990s and annual report available as downloadable 
PDFs.
 
✓ Use a secure transaction site (like PayPal or DonateNow) to take online 
donations.
 
People are somewhat cautious about online scams and their personal privacy 
(as they should be). Be willing to go the distance and then some to show your 
online donors that you mean what you say. Down the road, your efforts will 
mean better-informed, more-committed constituents and a well-developed, 
useful, thriving Web site.
Adding Content and Keeping It Fresh
In times of economic challenge, your Web space (which includes your Web 
site and all your content in social media networks) becomes valuable real 
estate because it provides a low- or no-cost way for you to share your stories 
with the world. When you refresh your Web content regularly, sharing touch-
ing success stories, requests for volunteers, board involvement, and news 
about your organization, you show the world that you’re thriving and con-
tinuing to do good work, no matter what the financial landscape may be.
 
Updating your Web content regularly not only gives your visitors something 
new to look at when they visit your site, but also increases your chances of 
appearing at the top of the results list when visitors search for your organiza-
tion using popular search engines. We give you some suggestions for how to 
keep your content fresh in the following sections.
Putting your contact information 
front and center
Don’t hide your light under a basket. Many people who come to your site 
may be looking for your contact information. Don’t make them go through 
pages of content and scroll down just to find a simple phone number. Put 

240
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
your phone number, address, and e-mail address on every page of your site. 
Include a Contact Us page that puts all your contact information in one easy-
to-find place, including a way to e-mail individual staff members directly.
 
Remember to include your organization’s name and logo on every page to 
help reinforce your organization’s brand. For more about branding your orga-
nization, see Chapter 17.
Including information that saves time
One of the great benefits your Web site offers when times are tight is a place 
where donors can find and download for free items that would otherwise 
cost your organization money and time to gather and mail. In addition to 
posting documents such as newsletters and brochures that volunteers would 
ordinarily stuff and mail, you can post your events calendar, hours, direc-
tions to your location, or anything else that people ask frequently. Doing so 
allows your volunteers to focus their time and effort on other tasks that may 
be more directly connected to fulfilling your organization’s mission, such as 
reading to young children, building homes for the homeless, or going door to 
door to collect canned foods for your annual food drive.
Writing content yourself
If you have the time and energy to write fresh, new content on a regular 
basis, more power to you. But writing online content can be time consuming, 
especially when you need to refresh it regularly.
 
Try to spread the work around and post articles written by you, other staff 
members, board members, or volunteers. Even though you may have to edit 
materials for quality, organize a writing effort that involves many people to 
keep new ideas and perspectives at the forefront — and to keep you from 
becoming swamped with an endless need for new content.
Using existing materials
You can also keep your online content fresh by thinking creatively about 
ways to use the materials you already created for other purposes. You can 
simply modify these materials slightly for the Web. For example, you may 
want to take a look at the content in the following items and try to adapt 
them for Web use:
 
✓ Brochures
 
✓ Case studies of people served by your group

241
 Chapter 16: Ramping Up Your Web Site
 
✓ Fundraising direct mail pieces
 
✓ Grant proposals describing exciting new projects
 
✓ Newspaper articles about your activities
 
✓ Posters for upcoming events
 
✓ Press releases
 
✓ Print newsletters
 
✓ Reprinted letters of gratitude from constituents (with their permission, 
of course)
 
✓ Your mission statement
The point is to use these materials you’ve created to keep your Web site 
interesting. Here are just a few ideas for how you can modify already-created 
materials for the Web:
 
✓ Add photos, videos, or audio clips.
 
✓ Use Web-friendly fonts and offer printable and downloadable versions.
 
✓ Keep stories brief and to the point. (As a general rule, people don’t read 
lengthy documents on their computer screens.)
Linking to content on other Web sites
Another way to add interest to your Web site is by adding content from other 
sites. One option for doing so is adding a news feed to your site (a kind of 
subset of a news feed is called an RSS feed, which stands for Really Simple 
Syndication). Essentially, to add a news feed to your site, you use code pro-
vided by another site to place a feed of their content onto your site. News 
organizations like The Washington Post and The New York Times provide RSS 
feeds for their content. To keep your site interesting and relevant to potential 
donors and volunteers, you can include an RSS feed that relates to your par-
ticular industry area to provide site visitors with recent news about the area 
that impacts the people you serve.
You can also put links to other sites on your site. Doing so provides site visi-
tors with a way to move from your site to another site to read its content and 
then to return to your site to keep browsing your content. Although your site 
visitors obtain the content from somebody else’s site, they get to that other 
site through your site, which is a benefit visitors will associate with your site.
 
Search engines track links, so the greater number of links you include on 
your site, the more likely it is to get picked up by major search engines. So go 
ahead — link away!

242
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Considering the value of online media
On today’s Web it’s easier than ever to add YouTube videos, podcasts, stream-
ing content, Webinars, and more. All these items can run on your Web page, 
and you can add them almost as easily as you add links to other Web pages.
If you plan to venture into adding media to your site, make sure you consider 
the following questions:
 
✓ What kinds of media will your visitors enjoy? Video clips can be fun 
and engaging — and can tell a great story — but they can also annoy 
some visitors. Will you provide an opt-out option so people who don’t 
want to watch your ten-minute video can skip it?
 
✓ How computer savvy are your visitors? Not all site visitors have state-
of-the-art computer systems with the processing power (or the Internet 
bandwidth) to run high-end videos, large podcasts, or sophisticated ani-
mations. Instead of frustrating your visitors who have slower systems, 
think about how you can create a Web experience that will satisfy the 
greatest number of visitors.
 
✓ Is your media original? Most public sites like YouTube and Facebook 
today want you to guarantee either that the content you’re uploading 
is original or that you have the necessary permissions to post the con-
tent. In other words, the videos and podcasts you post should be your 
own work or work that has been done expressly for your organization. 
Additionally, if any of the people you serve are in the videos, photos, or 
podcasts you want to upload, be sure you have their written permission 
before posting their likeness on the Web.
 
A Webinar is a relatively new offering that can provide an exciting mix of 
instruction and inspiration, including chats, presentations, videos, and more. 
Find out more about hosting Webinars in Chapter 19.
Attracting Visitors to Your Site
The most obvious way to let people know about your Web site is to print 
it on each and every scrap of material that leaves your office. Here are just 
some of the places you can note your Web site address:
 
✓ Banners for events
 
✓ Brochures
 
✓ Bumper stickers

243
 Chapter 16: Ramping Up Your Web Site
 
✓ Business cards
 
✓ E-mail newsletters
 
✓ Envelopes
 
✓ Grant applications
 
✓ Letters
 
✓ Press releases
 
✓ Public service announcements
 
✓ Signature line of your e-mail messages
 
✓ Social media sites
 
✓ Thank-you notes
 
✓ Volunteer nametags
 
One easy way to help people remember your site is to choose a Web address 
that’s as close to your organization’s name as possible. For example, the Web 
address for Indy Great Pyrenees Rescue is www.igpr.org. The Web address 
for the Jazz Institute of Chicago is www.jazzinchicago.org. When folks 
are guessing what your site may be, they often simply type a logical address 
in their browser to try to find you, so the more straightforward your Web 
address is, the better.
Sometimes people aren’t looking for your organization or its Web site when 
they happen to stumble onto you by other means online. Isn’t the Internet 
great? In the following sections, we tell you how to increase your chances of 
having this kind of situation happen.
Showing up in search engine results
Search engines such as Yahoo!, Google, Bing, and ChaCha help people find 
Web sites. The search engines regularly “crawl” the Web searching out new 
sites to include in their ever-growing indexes. Use the following tips to help 
your Web site show up in search result lists:
 
✓ Submit your Web address to as many search engines as you can. 
Go to www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.
py?answer=70897 to find out more about how Google finds and 
indexes sites for the Google search engine.
 
✓ Think carefully about the keywords that are linked to your organiza-
tion in a typical search. If you’re an animal rights group, for example, 
list yourself under the obvious animals, dogs, and cats, but don’t forget 
animal rights, animal advocacy, pets, and animal protection.

244
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
✓ Research submission services to find out whether you want to hire a 
service to submit your information to many search engines at once. 
Sites such as www.morevisibility.com and www.wpromote.com are 
examples of these services.
 
✓ Get included in lists of nonprofits on nonprofit information sites like 
www.charitywatch.org. When people search those sites for your 
name, you want it to pop up.
Getting linked by other sites
If you’re working with a Web designer to design your site, don’t forget to have 
him or her also create an easily distributable link to your site. You can bring 
your site lots of traffic just by giving other sites the code they can place on 
their sites to allow people to jump to your site easily. Some sites post an icon 
or your logo for the link; others include a text link (your name highlighted in 
blue) that people can click to go to your site. Either way, site visitors have an 
easy way to go from one site to your site in seconds!
Here are some ideas of people or organizations you can ask to link to your 
site:
 
✓ Organizations with similar causes in other regions of the country or 
world
 
✓ Organizations or people who run sites that are central points for infor-
mation about your type of cause
 
✓ Local organizations or corporations that you work with on a regular basis
 
✓ Media outlets such as local newspapers that offer nonprofits links on 
their sites
 
✓ Friends and fans who have connected with you through social media, 
such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and blogs
 
If you modify your site address in some fashion, don’t forget to share the new 
address with other sites or provide a way for them to be forwarded from the 
old link to your new site. Otherwise, people trying to get to your site will hit a 
dead end and may give up trying to find you on the spot.
Collecting Donations Online
More and more nonprofit organizations today are offering their donors the 
ability to donate online. Although the typical online donor gives less than 
an offline donor, the good news is that many donors give both ways — with 
smaller increments online and larger amounts through the mail or in person.

245
 Chapter 16: Ramping Up Your Web Site
When you offer your donors the ability to give online, you provide them 
with a convenient way to support you that they can access 24 hours a day. 
You also give people who are moved by the work you’re doing the chance to 
donate anytime they’re on your site without having to call anyone to make a 
pledge.
With so many benefits, why wouldn’t you want to offer an online donation 
feature? Just make sure you post the fact that you accept online donations all 
over your site so visitors can easily find and use the feature.
 
Be sure to note on all your print materials that you accept donations online, 
and don’t forget to include your Web site address, too. Even if you’re sending 
a paper donation form to a potential donor, note your Web donation informa-
tion on it, as well. Some people find it easier to make an online donation than to 
write a check, address and stamp an envelope, and put the letter in the mail — 
and making donating easy is one of your main fundraising goals.
When you set up a system to accept online payments, you need to design an 
interactive electronic form that users can easily fill out, navigate, and submit. 
You also need to allow for a selection of different payment types.
 
Be sure to make the donation form you post online printable for those donors 
who start to give online and then change their minds and decide to print the 
form and mail a check instead.
If your organization is already set up to accept credit card donations in 
person, you’re pretty much set to accept credit card payments submitted 
online, too. Depending on how your Web site is set up to receive the payment 
information, you can elect to receive the electronic form in your office and 
then manually process the payment along with all your other credit card pay-
ments. Talk to your Web designer for more information on how credit card 
payments can be submitted and received from your Web site.
If you aren’t set up to accept credit cards, you have to complete a few steps 
to get ready to accept online payments. First, you need to get a merchant ID 
from your state so that you can then set up a merchant account to receive 
credit card payments; then you have to complete the setup process with 
the credit card companies you want to accept payments from. Sites such 
as WorldPay (www.rbsworldpay.com) explain what you need to do to set 
yourself up to accept online credit card payments. Finally, you can use a pay-
ment service such as PayPal (www.paypal.com) to accept payments from 
people’s bank accounts with bankcard payments.
 
Don’t want to go through the hassle of setting up a merchant account to 
receive online payments? Consider using a third-party charity donation site 
to gather online donations for you. Sites such as Network for Good (www.
networkforgood.org) charge a monthly subscription fee and offer services 
that handle all the donation submissions and processing for you.

246
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
As you prepare to raise funds online, do research in your home state to find 
out about any fundraising regulations that may apply. Some states require reg-
istration and will want to know how much you raise online and from where 
you raise it. Online fundraising is a quickly growing area, so be sure you have 
someone on your fundraising team who can help you navigate the legal issues 
if you plan to raise funds in cyberspace.

H
ow is your organization known in your community? In your industry? 
In the world? When people think of your organization, what do you 
want them to feel? When they see your logo, what do you want them to 
remember about you?
The answers to these questions point to something important your organiza-
tion builds with every single donor contact: your brand. This chapter helps 
you think through the brand you’re creating as you communicate with your 
donors using various online approaches. Of course, your brand doesn’t begin 
and end in the online realm — your brand is the intrinsic value and meaning 
your organization has in the minds and hearts of your donors. Your brand 
reaches right to the center of what your donors believe is true about you.
In this chapter, we help you understand what it takes to create a good brand, 
and then we show you how to use the Internet to extend the reach of your 
brand so you’re reaching as many people as possible with the message you 
want to convey.
Knowing Your Branding Basics
Branding is a well-established phenomenon that dates back to the early days 
of advertising, but recently it’s become more and more a part of the non-
profit world. Branding describes the way a product, organization, company, 
or other entity is known and valued in the public eye. Your brand identity lets 
you know how many people recognize your brand on sight.

248
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
What do you think of when you read the names Goodwill Industries, Red Cross, 
or United Way? Unfortunately, not all your thoughts may be positive, thanks 
to challenges some of these organizations have faced in recent years. But 
when you consider what you know about the organizations — what they 
stand for, what services you think they provide, how they help others — 
you’re considering what you know about their brands.
Your donors have similar thoughts about you. When they receive an e-mail 
message from you or they visit your Web site, they have a certain belief 
about who you are and what you do. As donors, they internalize your brand 
to some degree — and as a good, communication-savvy fundraiser, you want 
to build on the positive impact of your brand and make sure increasing num-
bers of people know about it.
Especially in times of economic challenge, your brand is a vitally important 
part of your organization’s identity. How do people perceive your brand 
today? Your answer to that question may help you jumpstart interest in areas 
that had previously fallen flat. For example, John serves on the board of the 
Indianapolis Museum of Art, and, after testing its brand, the museum found 
that the general public regarded the art museum as an elitist organization. 
As a result, the organization and its board began working to change that 
perception. Their new ad campaign, “It’s your art,” built on the idea that the 
museum is accessible, open, and welcoming to all people interested in art.
 
Although you can find the term branding used in many ways in both the 
for-profit and nonprofit realms, we use it in this book to refer to the way 
your public knows you — both through personal experience and through the 
public sense of who and what you are. Luckily, the question of how you’re 
perceived isn’t answered only in the minds of your beholders; the messages 
you offer and the ways in which you communicate with your donors both 
directly and indirectly, online and in person, help you reinforce the brand 
you want to build long-term.
Assessing Your Brand
So if you’re a small organization, how do you find out what the public’s per-
ception of you is? When you want to assess the brand your organization is 
developing, the best place to begin is with a good question:
When you hear your organization’s name (or see the logo), what occurs 
to you?
You can ask this question to donors, focus groups, people receiving your 
services, other organizations, or random passersby. You can send people 
around with clipboards, canvassing neighborhoods in your area. You can do 
a telephone campaign with the sole purpose of gauging public awareness. 

249
 Chapter 17: Extending Your Brand Online
You can hire a group to test your brand and give you a report on public per-
ception (yes, this option is a little pricey, but it’s likely to give you good info 
to start with).
You can also begin your brand assessment closer to home — with yourself 
and your board. Asking yourself and your board questions like the following 
can get you started in the right direction:
 
✓ How have we been mentioned in the news in the last six months?
 
✓ What are we hearing from long-time donors?
 
✓ Why do new donors say they’ve decided to support us?
 
✓ Which organizations in our community have contacted us in the last 
year for possible partnering opportunities?
 
✓ How do we feel we’re regarded in our town?
These questions can keep you busy for an afternoon — or longer — and can 
get you thinking outside your walls to the larger public picture. In your brand 
assessment, be sure to include important bits of data like how many people 
visit your Web site during the month, how many people subscribe to your 
e-newsletter, and what your fan base looks like on Facebook.
Whether you use a third party to help you evaluate your organization’s brand 
or you do it yourself (with your board and key staff members), pull all your 
data together in a brainstorming session and seek to get a sense of how 
your organization is currently perceived. The next challenge is to determine 
whether your results are pointing in the right direction, and, if they’re not, 
how you can do a brand makeover with your communications efforts. The 
following sections explain what you can do if your organization is in need of a 
brand makeover.
Tweaking your brand
Suppose that after putting together a series of focus groups, an online survey, 
and a number of discussions with tried-and-true loyal volunteers, you deter-
mine that the public doesn’t quite understand your organization’s mission. 
Perhaps your organization is perceived to be a group that serves the elderly 
in your community when you really serve all families of any age. You have 
some tweaking to do to make sure that your services and programs are heard 
by the right people. Where do you begin?
First, evaluate your existing messaging and try to determine where you can 
expand stories, images, and more to show the piece of the puzzle that’s miss-
ing from the public’s perception — in the case of our example, the younger 
people in your community. Return to your e-mail messages, annual report, 
newsletters, brochures, Web content, and more. Anything that speaks to 

250
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
your organization’s identity requires your full attention to determine where 
and how you can include the missing group more obviously.
Next, develop a new campaign designed to raise awareness specifically for 
the audience group that’s previously been overlooked. Similar to the way the 
Indianapolis Museum of Art included the whole community — not just the elite 
population — in the “It’s your art” campaign (see the “Knowing Your Branding 
Basics” section for specifics), develop a message that speaks directly to the 
mistaken view reflected back by your brand analysis. This helps you focus 
on the group of donors that may have missed your messaging in the past — 
which can translate to a boost in fundraising for your organization.
Finally, be consistent in your expanded messaging and be sure your 
improved branding efforts are reflected not only in print pieces and e-mail 
but also in the various ways you reach out online (which just happen to be 
the branding channels we cover in this chapter).
Developing brand strategies
Throughout Part III of this book, we talk about various ways to tell your story 
and build your organization’s perception in the public eye. We cover sharing 
your story in social media outlets; working with television, radio, and more; 
improving your Web site; and sending e-mail and e-newsletters. Each of these 
avenues enables you to tell your story and invite donor engagement (and, 
hopefully, gifts).
The rest of this chapter focuses on additional ways you can help spread the 
news about your organization using online channels. The following sections 
offer additional online options for building your brand.
 
The most important way to communicate with your donor is the way in which 
he or she is most likely to hear what you have to say. Depending on the age 
and interest of your donors, and the focus of your mission and programs, dif-
ferent strategies work best for different groups. When in doubt about which 
communication outlet will work best with your particular set of donors, ask 
a few of your long-time supporters which outlets they prefer and which ones 
have provided them with the most useful information about your organization 
over the years. They’ll be pleased you asked for their insight, and you’ll gain 
the perspective of people who really know what you do and who you are.
Blogging Your Way to Funds
Chances are you’re already aware of blogs. Maybe you even have one. 
Although blogging began as a kind of opinionated personal journalism, blog-
ging started a new era of publishing that gave the voice of some authority to 

251
 Chapter 17: Extending Your Brand Online
personal experience and perspective. Today individuals and organizations 
have blogs on which they share commentary, responses, links to other sites, 
photos, and even personal diaries.
As an individual fundraiser, you can either create your own blog or blog as 
the voice of your organization (be sure to check with your board and execu-
tive director about doing so before you set up your blog). Visit sites such as 
www.weblogtoolscollection.com or www.blogger.com to find simple 
tools for creating blogs. After you’ve created your blog, get it listed in blog 
directories like www.blogcatalog.com for maximum exposure. Or spend 
some time visiting blogs that relate to your area of interest, and post a few of 
your own comments, sharing the mission and passion (and Web site address, 
of course!) of your organization with others.
 
As you set up your blog, you may want to add an RSS feed to your blog so 
readers can easily know what’s happening with your organization. RSS stands 
for Really Simple Syndication and it enables readers who subscribe to your 
RSS feed to automatically receive any fresh content you put on the blog. RSS 
feeds make receiving your updates easy for your blog readers and help you 
know your stories are being heard. For more about RSS feeds, see Chapter 16, 
and also consult Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies, by Ellen 
Finklestein (Wiley).
Figuring the cost of blogs
Blogs don’t cost a whole lot to produce, except the cost of your time to 
post content, monitor the blog discussion, and respond to blog comments. 
For example, Blogger (www.blogger.com), which is Google’s blogger ser-
vice, is absolutely free. Setting up a blog on that site can take as little as a 
few minutes.
Going, giving, gone!
Following in the successful wake of eBay, 
online charity auctions are a recent phe-
nomenon. These auctions offer cool ways to 
raise money for a particular cause or event. 
MissionFish (www.missionfish.com) is 
one good example of an online charity auction. 
You can trade on eBay through the MissionFish 
site. eBay sellers select a charity to sponsor, 
and then a portion of any of their sales goes to 
that charity. Donors can go to www.mission
fish.com to see a list of eBay sellers asso-
ciated with giving. You can easily sign up on 
this site to get your nonprofit registered with 
MissionFish. You just need to provide informa-
tion about your 501(c)(3) status, a mission state-
ment, a voided check, your e-mail address, and 
an electronic version of your logo. Best of all, 
registration is free.

252
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
Perhaps the greatest cost is in marketing your blog. But consider that you 
can piggyback your blog marketing onto every other marketing vehicle you 
use (your brochures or Web site, for example), and you can include the blog 
link in the signature line of every e-mail message you write for free.
Building your brand with an effective blog
Writing a blog is a little different from writing a brochure or a fundraising 
proposal. The idea here is to keep people intrigued and participating — and 
to continue to reinforce your brand in the process. Here’s what you need to 
do to create a blog that helps you build your brand (and keeps readers inter-
ested at the same time!):
 
✓ Write about stories that showcase key ways your organization lives out 
its mission with real people.
 
✓ Post questions that get people thinking and contributing their own ideas.
 
✓ Offer statistics about your cause that may be new to your audience.
 
✓ Keep your posts positive. Be a voice of truth and hope in your industry, 
and reinforce the brand idea that your organization is an expert in a par-
ticular area and is working to be relevant to the needs of your community.
Publishing Online to Boost Your 
Branding and Credibility
If you’ve ever written a press release, you know the value of just getting your 
organization’s name in print. The Internet contains a huge amount of content, 
and some sites may welcome articles or other pieces of news about your 
group. Not only will you gain positive exposure by getting published online, 
but you also build credibility for yourself and your organization by being 
quoted as an expert in your area of service.
Another great thing about publishing online is that information seldom sits 
still on one site. Other sites or search engines pick up links to articles; people 
forward articles to others via e-mail. Putting an article or press release out 
on the Web is like dropping a pebble in a pond: The ripples can continue for 
quite a while. The following sections can help you get published on the Web.
Getting published
To get content published online, you can follow several approaches:

253
 Chapter 17: Extending Your Brand Online
 
✓ Visit sites that are somehow related to your target donor groups’ inter-
ests, and send e-mails to the Webmasters of those sites, using the links 
on their Contact Us pages.
 
✓ Check out online versions of magazines or newspapers related to your 
potential donors’ interests to see whether they include information on 
how to submit stories to them somewhere on their Web sites. For exam-
ple, if you work for a musical performing arts organization, you may 
check into sites that cover musical interests, local music performances, 
or music schools.
 
✓ Submit questions or comments that may get published to related online 
publications with letters-to-the-editor kinds of features.
 
Some sites publish content that is then picked up for use on other sites. You 
can submit some of your own content to these sites — along with info about 
your organization, of course — to help build your visibility online. Try using 
these sites, called content directories, such as How To Advice (www.howto
advice.com), to submit online content that gets exposure on many sites. 
Some sites also provide templates and articles explaining how you can write 
and submit content to their sites.
Creating good online content
You’re more likely to get your submissions published if their content is what 
the publishing sites are looking for. Here are a few tips to help you create 
content that works well on the Web:
 
✓ Pay attention to submission guidelines. If the guidelines say no more 
than 300 words, don’t submit an article with 350.
 
✓ Format the article correctly. Some sites want submissions in HTML, 
while others want plain text. Receiving articles in the proper format saves 
sites time and effort in making your content look presentable online.
 
✓ Make the title mean something. You want to grab attention right away, 
so make your title mean something to readers. After all, the title of your 
article may be the only thing that appears in a link a visitor clicks to 
view the entire article.
 
✓ Use a good text editor, and check spelling and grammar. Use the spell-
checker in your favorite word-processing program before you send your 
content to an editor. You want your organization to look as good as pos-
sible, so make sure you double-check your spelling and grammar. After 
all, you want your readers to see that you care about your cause and 
your mission.

Joining Online Communities: 
Discussion Groups
A discussion group is an online community that discusses an area of common 
interest. Hundreds of thousands of discussion groups are available online, 
with topics ranging from schnauzers to special events.
Discussion groups have been a part of the Web for a relatively long time, but 
their power to connect with others and stimulate conversation about topics 
continues today. In many places online today, however, the old term discus-
sion forum has become discussion group. Regardless of what they’re called, 
these community-gathering spots where people post messages are reminis-
cent of bulletin boards you find in your office break room or local library. 
Discussion group conversations can go on for months or even years and 
involve hundreds of people.
 
You can use discussion groups to connect to the fundraising community for 
advice, or you can use them to gain exposure for your organization. Always be 
sure to include your organization’s name, blog address, and social media con-
nections in your signature line. And be aware that the content of your post — 
a relatively simple communication — is building your brand with every word 
you write.
The following sections offer some good places to start if you’re seeking a 
discussion group to join. We also offer some tips about topics to address 
and avoid.
Checking out nonprofit discussion groups
As you begin your search for the right discussion group to join, take note of 
the many nonprofit-related choices out there. You can post comments on the 
discussion groups of fundraising-related sites to receive helpful advice and 
tips, or you can post on general nonprofit sites just to get your organization’s 
name and mission out there for people to see. So how does the discussion 
group work? When you post a message, it becomes available in a discussion 
area to both the site’s members and its visitors. People read your message 
and can respond with a comment. When you get multiple replies to your mes-
sage, you end up with what’s called a discussion thread.
More nonprofit-related discussion groups are springing up all the time. 
Here’s a representative sampling for you to check out:

255
 Chapter 17: Extending Your Brand Online
 
✓ CharityChannel.com: Click on the Forum link on the CharityChannel.com 
home page (www.charitychannel.com) to access discussion groups 
on topics such as annual funds and development.
 
✓ Soc.org.nonprofit: You can join the soc.org.nonprofit discussion group 
(one of the oldest nonprofit discussion groups out there) either by using 
a newsreader program to subscribe to the USENET group called soc.org.
nonprofit or by sending an e-mail to nonprofit-request@rain.org 
with the word Subscribe in the subject field.
 
✓ About.com: Although this Web site provides information about many 
topics, you can go to www.nonprofit.about.com and click the 
Community Forum in the Discuss area of the page to find out more 
about nonprofit-related discussion groups you can join.
 
✓ Idealist.org: This site offers almost 2,000 idealist groups in 127 coun-
tries, boasting more than 20,000 members. You’re sure to find a conver-
sation you’ll enjoy here. Go to www.idealist.org and click Groups to 
get started.
Promoting yourself through 
discussion groups
To get exposure for your organization among the donor population, try post-
ing comments on sites related to your cause rather than on fundraising sites. 
Focusing on cause-related sites may be more useful because people who give 
money to your type of cause look for sites related to your cause, while other 
professional fundraisers visit fundraising sites. For example, if your organiza-
tion deals with battered women, go to sites that provide advice or services to 
those people. If your organization helps take care of rescued animals, go to 
large chain pet store sites, sites that advise people on what breed of puppy 
is right for them, or pet food company sites and see if they have discussion 
groups you can join.
When you post comments in discussion groups, don’t post a self-serving 
appeal for funds — doing so isn’t good etiquette (see the nearby “Discussion 
group etiquette” sidebar for more info). Instead, try to provide information or 
respond to others’ questions in a way that’s useful and simply include a quick 
mention of your organization and your Web site address in your message. Over 
time, you establish a presence in these discussion groups, and people recog-
nize that your group cares enough to help others out. In turn, they may wander 
over to your Web site and help you out with a donation. Remember, taking part 
in discussion groups is community building, not advertising! Discussion group 
involvement can be time consuming, but it can pay off in the end.

256
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
Instant messaging and chat groups are different from discussion groups in 
that the conversations are held in real time (called synchronous communica-
tion in techie circles). In a discussion group, you post a message one day, and 
somebody reads it sometime later (called asynchronous communication). With 
instant messaging and chat groups, you send a message to somebody who 
gets it almost immediately and responds.
Partnering Online through 
Affinity Programs
An affinity program is an arrangement with a for-profit organization that 
agrees to donate a certain percentage of income to your charitable cause. For 
example, have you ever gotten a call from a magazine telling you that if you 
buy a subscription, they’ll give $1 to some worthwhile cause? Or, does your 
local superstore offer a program whereby you can donate to local schools as 
you check out? If so, you’ve already encountered affinity programs in action. 
If your organization has a large membership or works with a large donor 
base, affinity partnerships may be particularly attractive to vendors because 
your large constituency enables them to expand their reach into new areas.
You may be surprised to find out just how many different affinity programs 
are out there. For example, Igive.com (www.igive.com) offers an affinity 
program that provides a penny for every search you do on its site and a 
percentage of each purchase you make there to the nonprofit organization 
of your choice. Other affinity programs offer credit cards that pay out a per-
centage to a sponsored nonprofit.
Discussion group etiquette
When posting to a discussion group, always 
make the subject of your post meaningful so 
others can easily figure out what your topic 
is and decide whether they want to become 
involved. Check your post for errors and clarity. 
Error-ridden postings are not only hard to read, 
but may also reflect badly on your organization. 
Be careful what you say: If you’re responding 
to a negative comment about your organization, 
don’t let your emotions take charge. Be thought-
ful, informative, and gracious in your reply. 
Remember that your comments in discussion 
groups reflect on your organization as well as 
on you. Anyone can copy an irate posting and 
send it around the world via e-mail or some 
other vehicle. Do you really want something 
said in the heat of the moment to represent your 
cause and your organization?

257
 Chapter 17: Extending Your Brand Online
Notice that an affiliate program is different from an affinity program. With 
an affiliate program, you put a link to another Web site on your own site. 
When people click the link to go to the other site, you get a small commis-
sion. Affiliate programs can be profitable, but be sure that the affiliate sites 
are of good quality and that they relate to your areas of interest. Otherwise, 
your constituency will click on them and be offended, or just plain bored, 
with the result.
Keep in mind that the affinity groups you partner with want to make money 
off the goodwill your name generates, but they offer you an additional fund-
raising venue that can be profitable. Consider the character of an affinity 
group carefully before getting involved with its program. With affinity pro-
grams, you’re stepping into the world of commerce, and you certainly don’t 
want a badly or shadily run business hurting your organization’s brand or 
reputation.
 
Because affinity groups are involved in e-commerce, the income you get from 
involvement in them can be subject to unrelated business income tax. Check 
with your lawyer or accountant before signing up with an affinity program.
Connecting with People through 
Association and Special-Interest Sites
Just as in the real world, people find people (and organizations) in different 
places online. Where you get noticed has a lot to do with the way people 
interpret your mission. If your site appears on a national organization in your 
particular service area, for example, this adds to the credibility of your non-
profit. If you show up on a hip, cool site frequented by college students, you 
may be seen as a youth-friendly organization. You may find that simply plac-
ing links to your site on other sites that attract visitors with common inter-
ests is a good way to build your organization’s brand online.
Here are some examples of typical site-to-site connections you may want to 
explore:
 
✓ If your group supports animal rights, go to the Web sites for the 
American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) 
(www.aspca.org) and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) 
(www.peta.org) to ask them to put a link to your site on theirs. Don’t 
forget to also contact PetSmart, which has a charity to help homeless 
animals, as well as other pet food and supply companies.

258
Part III: Telling Your Story and Building Your Brand 
 
✓ If you represent a health-related group, such as one that works for 
breast cancer research, consider any sites related to health concerns, 
sites directed toward women as a group, and sites related to medical 
associations.
 
✓ If your organization is raising funds for the arts, try the sites for your 
local arts council, record stores and bookstores, art supply stores, and 
libraries.
The point here is that the groups and sites you can partner with to build your 
organization’s brand are limited only by your imagination. On the Internet, 
the rule is constant change, so go ahead and ask whether a site will add a link 
to your site; what can it hurt?

B
eing able to tell your story, connect with your 
donors, relate to your board, and create a good 
plan for fundraising are important parts of successful 
fundraising in any economic climate. All that work leads 
to the ultimate goal: raising the funds to operate your 
organization.
Knowing how to use the various campaigns at your 
disposal — annual fund drives, special events, capital 
campaigns, major gift programs, corporate-giving pro-
grams, and endowments — helps you make a great con-
nection between your donors’ ability to give and your 
organization’s needs. This part of the book introduces you 
to each of these fundraising campaigns and shows you 
how to start, run, assess, and reuse these various cam-
paigns so you get the biggest possible benefit from your

Organizing, Implementing, and 
Celebrating Your Annual Fund
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out what annual funds are
▶ Setting up your annual campaign and putting it in motion
▶ Evaluating your campaign and preparing for the next one
Your annual fund is the heart of your fundraising program. In both good 
and bad economic times, your annual fund is what keeps your organiza-
tion going — which means it also needs to be at the center of your fundrais-
ing efforts.
Most people are familiar with the annual fund drives held in their communities. 
You receive requests from the local zoo, churches, and schools, just to name 
a few. Even with this familiarity, however, most people who are approached 
to give have no idea of the work involved in running an annual fund campaign. 
Although each annual fund drive is different, careful planning, collaboration, 
and good management — along with effective result tracking — are key ingredi-
ents to the successful annual fund that has the potential to grow over time, no 
matter what the economy is doing at the moment.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of annual funds. Here, we offer you 
ideas for setting up and running a successful annual fund, as well as warn you 
about the “plan busters” that can hang you up along the way.
Understanding the Basics 
of Annual Funds
The annual fund is the fundraising drive that supports the operating costs 
and day-to-day program costs of your organization. Unlike large gifts that 
come from major donations, program initiatives, special events, or grant 

262
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
funding, the annual fund is comprised largely of smaller gifts from a wider 
variety of givers. The annual fund may pay your staff’s salaries, keep your 
lights on, put the roof over your heads, and pay for the vehicles that allow 
you to deliver your services. For this reason, annual funds can sometimes be 
difficult to maintain and grow thanks to their appeal factor — or lack thereof. 
After all, would you rather contribute to a fund that will pave the organiza-
tion’s parking lot or to a program that directly impacts people in need?
The important connection to make here — both for yourself and for your 
donor — is that both the annual fund and programmatic support work together 
to make realizing the mission of your organization possible. The annual fund 
provides the foundation on which you build all other programs and services. 
When you have a healthy annual fund, you not only have the start on some 
security for your organization, but you also have an engaged group of donors. 
And if you can provide those engaged donors — even if they currently give 
only $25 a year — with a good experience of your organization (which means 
being respectful and responsive as part of your annual fund drive), you have 
the potential to increase that donor’s involvement with your organization. 
Perhaps the donor will become a volunteer. Maybe she’ll increase the size of 
her gift. Maybe she’ll have such a good experience that she tells others about 
your organization, leading them to get involved, too. Simply put, the success 
and growth of your organization’s work starts with a well-planned annual fund.
Your annual fund may be large or small; you may spend weeks or only days 
planning it. Regardless, the system you develop and the planning you put 
into it are closely related — the more well thought out your plan is, the 
greater the return on your annual fund investment is likely to be.
 
Some big organizations hire fundraising consulting firms to help them deter-
mine whether expanded fundraising expectations are realistic. If you don’t 
want to hire an outside firm, go out and interview some prospective donors. 
Ask them to look at your mission statement and then ask, “Is this doable? Are 
our expectations out of line? Would this be a realistic donation option for 
you?” Using a focus group in this way takes a lot of legwork, but the result can 
be a tested fundraising goal with a number of people getting on board before 
the fundraising train leaves the station.
 
Annual Fund Buster #1: Not having a plan. If you think you can simply work 
toward your annual fund all year long without a specific strategy in place, 
think again. If you don’t have a specific plan in mind for your annual fund 
campaign, the funds that come in for that campaign will be spotty and short 
lived. With a carefully prepared annual fund plan, on the other hand, you 
know what you’re spending, how much you anticipate raising, who your key 
players are, and how you need to evaluate the effectiveness of the various 
parts of your plan after you reach your goals. Most importantly, you can dem-
onstrate clearly how your annual fund relates to your cash flow needs. If your 
plan enables you to share that story with your donors, they’ll be more likely 
to make the connection about why contributing to your annual fund is vital to 
the health of your organization.

263
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
Designing Your Annual Campaign
As you can see, the annual fund is the center of all the fundraising efforts 
for your organization. The time you spend planning and implementing your 
annual fund campaign relates directly to the success of the drive (and indi-
rectly to the success of your other campaigns) — spend the time now, put 
the systems in place, and go about your other fundraising efforts in an orga-
nized way. Taking the time to plan your annual fund drive beats the socks 
off launching blindly into the unknown and hoping a certain percentage of 
donors will want to support your continuing efforts.
To have a successful annual fund drive, you need to do the following:
 
✓ Know your goals.
 
✓ Plan your timing.
 
✓ Have a well-prepared team.
 
✓ Know which tools to use.
 
✓ Evaluate your efforts.
The following sections explore each of these important areas in more depth. 
In essence, these five areas provide the blueprint for putting together a well-
thought-out annual fund drive.
Helping your donors help you
One of the most compelling reasons for putting 
your best thought and effort into your annual 
fund is that your annual fund has the potential 
to reach donors you rarely get to reach through 
other campaigns. Unlike major givers, who most 
likely have some kind of continuing contact with 
your organization, annual givers are those small 
donors who may give a small, single donation 
once or twice a year. They may decide to give 
a small donation after visiting your Web site or 
after receiving an e-mail message or a newslet-
ter about new programs or announcements. Or 
they may become fans on your Facebook page. 
For the most part, though, this large group of 
donors and potential donors isn’t very involved 
with the day-to-day operation of your organiza-
tion, which means huge potential for you.
When you approach your annual fund givers in 
tough financial times, consider sharing infor-
mation on how to help them find a sense of 
financial security while still continuing to give. 
In doing so, you share your need with your 
potential donors while simultaneously showing 
them how making even a small gift helps your 
organization and enables them to make a dif-
ference in a cause they care about. As you pre-
pare your annual fund approach, check out the 
book Financial Peace Planner by Dave Ramsey 
(Penguin), which includes practical ideas on 
giving as one part of building a healthy finan-
cial future. You can find many other books on 
the subject, as well.

264
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Setting your goals
Most organizations rely on their annual funds to bring in the money they 
need to cover their standard operating expenses or to fund vital programs 
not supported by grant funding or government programs, plus whatever 
other expenses they need to cover growth in the areas where they’ve planted 
seeds. For example, an organization may use annual fund donations to pay 
for a donor recognition holiday luncheon or to purchase back-to-school kits 
for an afterschool program.
So what do you hope to cover with your annual fund campaign? You and 
your board need to put together a list of the goals you want to reach with 
your annual fund. For best results, appoint a development committee that’s 
willing to devote itself to setting up, carrying out, and evaluating your annual 
fund drive. And don’t forget — your board members and all those serving on 
committees should be givers themselves.
 
Be sure to include the following goals for your annual fund, as well as other 
goals related specifically to your organization’s mission:
 
✓ Bring in the specific amount of funds you need to reach your annual 
fund’s fundraising target goal.
 
 Use a giving pyramid, which we describe in Chapter 6, to determine 
your giving levels and the number of gifts you need in each area to meet 
your goal. Be sure to spend some time exploring what’s realistic for your 
organization right now.
Communication is education
Especially in a tough economic climate when 
people are tempted to clutch their purse strings 
more tightly, you need to make sure you tell 
your story well. You need to be able to articulate 
why contributing to your annual fund is a good 
idea for donors — and why their contributions 
are vital to the accomplishment of your mission. 
If you can tell your story well, with heart and 
creativity, you can show your donors what your 
annual fund is all about and inspire them to help 
keep the organization rolling.
When you create your appeal for the annual 
fund, think of it as a way to educate your donors 
about the importance of ongoing support. 
Connect the appeal to real stories and real 
people. Invite your donors in to see the day-
to-day details; show them where their hard-
earned dollars go.
To build awareness for your annual fund, you 
can even host a series of workdays in which 
donors can come to your facility and assist with 
daily operations. This kind of up-close-and-
personal experience may remove some of the 
distance that unfamiliar donors feel with your 
organization and draw them closer to the heart 
of what you do, which, as we’re sure you know, 
is a win for everyone.

 In good financial times, you may plan to surpass the previous year’s 
budget, but in times of hardship you may decide to lower your budget 
instead. Whether or not you publish the budget reduction in your 
budget is up to you, but showing the reduction in tough economic times 
may say something good about your organization — it sends a message 
about your willingness to be frugal when you need to be.
 
✓ Find new donors and upgrade existing donors.
 
 A great way to gauge your opportunity for engaging donors is to take 
a look at the recent history showing how many regular donors have 
lapsed in the past year. Simply look at your donor records to find out 
who gave two years ago but didn’t give in the previous year. Then do 
what you can to bring those lost donors back to your cause. Especially 
in a turbulent economy, you’re likely to get the greatest return on your 
fundraising investment by working to upgrade your current donors and 
invite back individuals who have given to your organization in the past.
 
✓ Enlist and train a dedicated volunteer corps.
 
✓ Identify potential higher-level donors.
 
Every organization is different, and all donor groups have their own unique 
personalities. For this reason, the best advice we can offer you in terms of 
setting goals for your annual fund is to talk to your donors. Know what situ-
ations and issues your donors are facing. What’s on their minds right now? 
What are they feeling good about? What are they worried about? How does 
your organization fit in? One large nonprofit organization recently decided to 
cut its annual fund budget during a tough financial situation. After making the 
decision, some members of the organization went out and did a focus group 
to find out whether there’s a difference between big donors and small donors 
in troubled times — and they found that everyone was hurting. As a result of 
their research, the organization was able to change its messaging to connect 
with its donors in new and unique ways. For the best results for your own 
organization, let your donors tell you about the factors that are influencing 
their giving decisions today.
Setting an annual fund goal can be a struggle in organizations large and small. 
Why? Because you don’t establish your campaign goal in a vacuum. You need 
to budget all the activities you support with your annual fund, adding the 
necessary percentage of increase for inflation over last year’s budget, and 
consider how you want to enhance your programs.
Struggles may result between your planning committee (“We want to add 
services for the kids with no hair this year!”) and your budget committee 
(“That’s too much of a stretch for this year — let’s try that next year!”). 
Ultimately, you face a moment of truth when everybody involved in your 
organization has to come together and ask, “Can we do it?” For many organi-
zations, that moment’s a tough one.

Reaching a consensus on your specific fundraising goal for your annual fund 
is a major part of setting up your annual fund — and doing so may take con-
siderable talking, planning, and reevaluating. Fortunately, all this talking 
gives your organization the chance to return to its mission statement, take a 
look at its priorities, and ultimately get everybody working together for the 
good of the cause.
Timing your annual fund
When the economy is pitching and swaying, remembering the needs of your 
donors and being creative with your annual fund approach may help you 
keep the funds coming and draw your donors closer at the same time. By 
thinking through the timing of your annual fund and giving donors the option 
of sending gifts in installments (even $10 a month), you show flexibility as 
well as compassion for your donors. You can also offer the option of auto-
matically debiting donors’ bank accounts, depending on who your audience 
is and how comfortable they are with automatic withdrawal. If your donors 
see this option as a convenient customer service, it can mean great things 
for your campaign, but if donors perceive this automatic service as a narrow-
ing of their options, you may not have many takers. This is one reason why 
knowing your donors is so important as you work through any campaign; see 
Chapter 7 for details on how you can get to know your donors.
Assembling your team
In larger organizations, the executive director or director of individual giving is 
in charge of leading the annual fund effort, with the help of an active board and 
development committee. In smaller organizations, the annual fund drive may 
be run entirely by volunteers. In churches, for example, one lucky volunteer 
often gets the lead role in the management of the annual fund; that volunteer’s 
job is to assemble the rest of the team and get the ball rolling. The following 
sections offer a few tips to get you started as you pull your team together.
Choosing the team leader
Although annual fund leaders come in all shapes and sizes, you want to make 
sure your leader is a person who’s fully aware of your mission. In addition, 
as with the leaders of other types of fundraising campaigns, the person in 
charge of your annual fund effort needs to be
 
✓ Passionate about your cause
 
✓ Able to both see the big picture and focus on the details
 
✓ Capable of creating a plan, getting it approved, and inspiring others to 
work on it

267
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
 
✓ Recognized as a person with whom people like to work
 
✓ Trained in leadership — either in a volunteer or professional capacity
 
✓ Respected by your constituency
 
✓ Able to put in the hours involved in leading a fundraising campaign
Putting your team in place
After you choose a team leader, you need to focus on assembling the rest of 
your team. The fundraising team you assemble has a direct impact on how 
well your annual fund meets its goals, so put some thought into choosing 
your team members.
Some members of your development committee may double as members of 
your annual fund team — in fact, you should have at least a member or two rep-
resent both groups. Your other team members can be anyone you think would 
do a good job. Just make sure they understand and feel passionate about the 
work you do. Important attributes of a team member include the following:
 
✓ Ability to communicate effectively
 
✓ Track record of following through on what he says he’ll do
 
✓ Training in basic fundraising skills
 
✓ Some experience in fundraising
 
✓ A reputation that promotes trust
 
Ask your board to help identify key volunteers who would be good annual 
fund team members.
Creating a successful team
You can help make sure the time and effort your annual fund team puts into 
the project pays off by making sure all the team members have what they 
need. For instance, your annual fund has a better chance of being successful 
if you make sure the team members have the following:
 
✓ Regular meetings to discuss the goals, strategies, and plans for the 
annual fund
 
✓ Materials used to compile annual fund publications
 
✓ Resources for compiling materials
 
✓ Access to existing and former donor lists and donor histories
 
✓ Prospective donor lists that show how the prospects are related to your 
organization and give some rationale for their ability to pay or their pay-
ment levels
 
✓ A system for easily tracking prospective donor responses

Annual Fund Buster #2: An uncommitted board. A lukewarm board won’t 
bring in large checks — and it won’t be able to do the day-in, day-out follow-up 
required to run an effective annual campaign. Be sure that your board under-
stands its role in the fundraising function of your organization before you 
launch an annual fund drive.
Choosing your fundraising tools
Because you want your annual fund plan to make the most of your resources 
and to be as effective as possible, take some time to think about which fund-
raising approaches you want to spend the most time on. We rank the main 
fundraising approaches here, from most to least effective.
Meeting face to face
A national survey by United Way indicates that seven out of ten people will 
say yes to a request from one of their peers when asked face to face for a 
donation. The biggest problem fundraisers have is not asking enough people 
in person or not involving volunteer leadership in “the Ask” often enough 
(see Chapter 10 for more on “the Ask”).
In a smaller organization, face-to-face contact may not get the same return, 
but it may very well get a bigger response than any other approach. After 
all, as the old fundraising saying goes, “People don’t give money to causes. 
People give money to people with causes.” The human element is extremely 
important in any campaign, including the annual fund drive — and a face-to-
face meeting gives your donors the easiest way to connect with you.
 
The best people for face-to-face meetings are those who are peers of the 
potential donors in the general organizational structure. For example, if you 
send a CEO in to talk to a top-level manager and the CEO makes a case for 
the organization, the manager may be left feeling that his donation or refusal 
could affect his job down the road. Better to avoid the situation altogether and 
select people for meetings based on their peer status. So instead of sending in 
the CEO, send in a fellow manager or someone in a comparable role.
When you’re fundraising in the workplace, people are likely to take note 
when you get one of their colleagues to solicit for your cause. After all, the 
person doing the asking is someone with whom others have an established 
relationship — in other words, trust already exists between the person with 
the cause and the person being asked. The thinking is, “Oh, well, if Sarah 
thinks this is a good organization, it probably is!”
Making personal calls
When you can’t be physically present with another person, a phone call really 
is the next best thing. A telephone call carries your voice — offering a connec-
tion that’s more intimate than a letter or e-mail message. Don’t underestimate 

269
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
the power of this personal connection — even when you’re just trying to 
decide whether or not to call a donor back after business hours so you can 
leave a message on his machine. (Don’t feel bad about making that call — 
we’ve certainly done it.)
Your responsiveness in a phone conversation helps build the relationship 
with the donor, which helps bring the donor closer to your organization (and 
may lead him to donate to your annual fund). Experience shows that people 
have more trouble saying no to a “live” person on the phone than they do 
ignoring a fundraising letter or a more impersonal solicitation.
Writing personal correspondence
Personal correspondence says to the donor, “You’re important enough to 
me that I took the time to write to you personally.” Like the personal phone 
call, this personal communication carries a bit of weight in the psychology of 
answering yes or no to a donation. However, a letter is more impersonal than 
the call or the visit because the real human contact is missing.
Nowadays an e-mail message sent directly to the donor — if the donor recog-
nizes your name — may feel slightly more personal than a letter. With a letter, 
donors have the option of never opening it, pitching it unseen into the trash, 
or misplacing it in a pile of other papers. With an e-mail message, donors may 
press Delete before they even open it to see what it’s about, so you risk not 
being heard either way. Both approaches have their pros and cons, but the 
best approach for your particular donors depends on their comfort levels 
with technology and their preferred methods of communication.
 
A personal letter with a phone call follow-up makes the contact more direct 
and alerts you if the recipient never received your letter. Take the time to 
write the note by hand, and you’ll improve your response rate.
Sending e-mail
Personalized e-mail contacts that are sent directly to the donor may elicit a 
quicker response than traditional mail because of their fast nature. For that 
reason, some nonprofit organizations conduct huge e-mail campaigns to take 
full advantage of online fundraising. E-mail also enables you to use the infor-
mation from your donor list to determine the groups you want to approach in 
your annual fund drive.
 
One flaw with some e-mail annual fund campaigns is that they often don’t offer 
an obvious way for the recipient to take action. You can ask the recipient to 
mail in a check, but you provide no envelope or pledge form. And clicking 
Reply to respond to a mass-produced e-mail message often ends up at a dead-
end address. You can improve results with e-mail campaigns by including a 
button or link in the e-mail that takes interested donors back to your site so 
they can make an online donation using a credit card. See Chapter 16 for more 
information on setting up donations online.

270
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Sponsoring special events
If you can get somebody to come to your special event, you already have 
one foot in the donation door. After all, someone who cares enough to come 
to your event is already interested and able to provide something to your 
organization. You just have to get that person involved specifically in your 
annual fund. Be sure to gather important data about your attendees at spe-
cial events, and save the comments they make about the evening. When the 
annual fund campaign rolls around the next time, you can mention that you 
appreciated their support at the special event last year and hope they’ll con-
sider contributing to the annual fund this year, as well. See Chapter 19 for 
information on planning special events.
Going door-to-door
As any Avon representative will tell you, cold door-to-door calling is an expen-
sive and time-consuming venture. Of all the “personal contact” options, this one 
is the lowest on the ladder in terms of effectiveness. If your prospective donors 
open their doors (and they may not if you’re holding something that looks like 
a sales kit), you need to cover a lot of ground in less than 30 seconds. Can you 
make someone see the heart of your organization — and want to donate to it — 
in that amount of time? Doing so isn’t impossible, but it’s certainly challenging 
and potentially dangerous if there’s an unfriendly dog around.
Using direct mail
As we mention in Chapter 12, direct mail is a very sophisticated operation 
today because of the ability to buy and sort mailing lists. Targeting people 
who already know about you — such as existing donors, last year’s members, 
attendees from events, or even people who have gone to or who are givers to 
similar organizations — allows for much more powerful niche mailing. A mail 
campaign may include an annual fund mailer (maybe in the form of a mem-
bership renewal), a brochure, postcards, newsletters, or catalogs.
Getting on TV and radio
As you may have seen, TV can be an effective means of generating support. 
For example, the televised videos and cries for help that followed the tsunami 
in Indonesia brought an outpouring of support that was funneled through the 
American Red Cross. TV and radio also give a sense of authenticity (whether 
it’s warranted or not is another matter); viewers and listeners often think 
that if they see something or hear something in the media, it must be true. 
TV and radio can be a great friend to your mission. Particularly if you have a 
noteworthy cause that has ties to current issues and events, you can use that 
event-related exposure to help gain recognition for your organization, which 
translates directly into more dollars raised for your cause.
 
Media coverage on the radio and TV is expensive and often prohibitive for 
nonprofit budgets. Try instead to get human-interest coverage on local cable 
channels or place stories in news programs. Or add a podcast to your Web 
site that others can listen to at their own convenience.

271
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
Using social media to spread the word
As we illustrate in Chapter 14, social media is spreading like wildfire through-
out the Internet. You can use Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and your blog to 
spread the word about your annual fund drive. Tell your stories, and invite 
friends, donors, fans, and followers to help you get the word out. If you have a 
special event planned as an annual fund kick-off, be sure to publicize it on all 
your social media sites. And use social media to keep your donors and public 
engaged, as well — ask and answer questions, post fun trivia facts related to 
your mission, and try to keep a buzz going that will draw others back to your 
organization’s Web site, where they can find out more about your annual fund.

Annual Fund Buster #3: Bad timing. Evaluating where you are in your fund-
raising planning is important before you embark on an annual campaign. Is 
your board ready? Do you have leadership for the campaign? How experi-
enced are your volunteers? Do you have the budget? These and other issues 
can have a lot to do with the success of your campaign — or lack thereof — so 

272
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
make sure you take your time in setting up your annual campaign. Be sure 
you’re comfortable with the overall rating you give your organization in Table 
18-1 before you start putting your annual fund plan in place.
Putting the Plan in Place
After you’ve identified your goals, chosen your team, and evaluated the fund-
raising tools at your disposal, you’re ready to get to work on your annual fund 
campaign. The first step is to identify prospects. Then you need to make sure 
you have the materials you need for support. Finally, you need to ensure that 
your volunteers are trained and ready. After completing these tasks, you’re 
ready to launch out into your community and begin your annual fund drive.
Understanding your approach: 
Donor research and planning
The annual fund campaign targets the following three types of donors:
 
✓ Prospects who have never given to your organization but who have 
interests or involvements that make them qualified candidates
 
✓ One-time donors whom you can approach for a repeat gift
 
✓ Repeat donors who can be upgraded to a higher giving level
Use the donor research strategies in Chapter 6 to find out more about the 
specifics of researching your donor audience.
 
Schedule at least one prospective-donor brainstorming session with your 
annual fund team and selected board members. Everybody needs to be ready, 
willing, and able to come up with names of potential donors that the annual 
fund team can use as they begin implementing their plan.
 
One of the items you need to research during this planning phase is the per-
centage of people helped by the work you do. Specifics ring true in the mind 
of the donor. For example, saying, “Your donation of $150 last year helped us 
warn a classroom of 30 preteens about the dangers of smoking” is much more 
effective than offering a generic thank-you.
Choosing your materials
After you identify the donor audience you want to target with your annual 
fund campaign, you need to take inventory of what you need to reach that 

273
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
audience. Your annual team members likely need one or more of the follow-
ing items to support them in their donor contacts:
 
✓ Online communications: Online fundraising approaches are becoming 
more and more popular because they offer fundraising professionals a 
low-cost, fast way to connect with donors. As you develop your approach 
for your annual fund, be sure to think through all online opportunities, but 
also be aware of how your own donor base will expect to receive the infor-
mation you provide. Provide these details — drawn from your own donor 
list — to all members of the annual fund team.
 
✓ Brochures (if your budget allows them): Printed brochures, flyers, 
or other publications explaining your annual fund are a nice touch 
to your campaign, but they can be pricey. Regardless of whether you 
include print pieces in your annual fund campaign, make sure you give 
any marketing pieces your organization uses to promote itself to your 
annual fund team members so they can at least consider them in their 
campaign plans. If your organization publishes an annual report, give it 
to your team members, as well, to help them understand what the funds 
are used for during the year.
 
 A lower-cost alternative to printing and mailing (or delivering) four-color 
print materials is to save the brochure, flyer, or report as a PDF file and 
make the file available to your donor on request or downloadable from 
your Web site.
 
✓ Your case statement: The all-important case statement gives a clear pic-
ture of your mission and explains why you — and only you — can offer 
the services you provide in the way that you provide them (see Chapter 
4 for more on the case statement).
 
 Come up with a revised case statement for each annual fund you do. 
Nobody wants to see the same information served up year after year. 
The donations from the previous years should be making some differ-
ence, after all. Your team members need to tell donors how their dona-
tions have helped and how you plan to use this year’s donations. Be 
sure your team members also communicate the continuing need — and 
your unique response to it — with enthusiasm and interest.
 
✓ Donor information sheets: Your annual fund team members also need 
information sheets on donors giving them donation history and perti-
nent background information. The information on these sheets can help 
your team members effectively relate and reach out to all your donors. 
These sheets are in addition to the donor list.
 
✓ Pledge cards: Givers to an annual fund often like to break their gifts into 
installments, which makes it easier for them to give larger amounts and 
easy for you to allocate income through the balance of your fiscal year. 
So make sure you arm your annual fund team members with plenty of 
pledge cards.

Five signs your plan is falling flat 
(and what to do about it)
Suppose that your annual fund team put together a great plan and you’re 
now midway through the first leg of the campaign. You thought your online 
donations would be picking up by now. Even in a challenging economy, you 
expected more interest. Is this lukewarm response the result of the times, or 
is something going wrong with your plan?
Although you certainly don’t like to think about all the hard work and effort 
you put into your annual fund campaign coming up empty, you need to be 
ready to identify any problems that creep up as you make your way through 
your plan. After you find out what’s going wrong, you can focus your efforts 
on fixing it. Here are a few symptoms of an annual fund plan in trouble (and 
what to do to eliminate them):
 
✓ Nobody wants to help. If you’re having trouble recruiting volunteers 
to help with the annual fund, people aren’t making the connection 
between your mission and their passion. The first gift people give in any 
campaign is the gift of their belief — if volunteers don’t believe in what 
you’re trying to do, ask yourself why. How can you communicate your 
vision more effectively? How well is your leadership telling your story?
 
✓ Your leadership is ho-hum. If the leaders of the annual fund effort aren’t 
passionate about what they’re doing — or worse, if they’re negative or dis-
heartened — keeping the energy up for everyone else is going to be next 
to impossible. Your volunteer leaders need to see the goal and believe 
they can reach it. Their passion then ignites possibilities for the rest of the 
group (and, as a result, you probably find more and more people wanting 
to help — which can help you solve the first problem in this list).
 
✓ People don’t show up for meetings. If you hold a meeting and nobody 
comes, you can be sure of two things: 
 
• People don’t think it’s an important use of their time.
 
• You won’t raise money that way.
 
 Be clear about your expectations for meetings, and ensure that your 
volunteer leadership is onboard to do whatever is necessary to get 
people in the seats, even if doing so means making night-before phone 
calls or e-mailing the 20 volunteers who are supposed to be at the 
meeting the next day.
 
✓ Your volunteers aren’t giving. Getting the buy-in of everyone involved in 
the fundraising campaign is an important part of building the energy you 
hope will inspire your larger donor base. If your volunteers aren’t giving to 
the program they’re helping to support with their time, how do you expect 
them to be effective in bringing funds into the organization? Even a $5 or 
$10 gift is a gift, so encourage all your annual fund volunteers to be givers 
to the campaign — 100 percent volunteer giving sets a great example.

275
 Chapter 18: Organizing, Implementing, and Celebrating Your Annual Fund
 
✓ Giving is down, down, down. When you compare the numbers — what 
you achieved by this time last year as compared to what you’ve brought 
in this year — the results are dismal. What do they mean? To some 
degree, the economy may be impacting what you’re bringing in, but if 
you’re still raising less than you expected even after you adjusted for the 
economy, check your plan and the engagement levels of your volunteers 
and leadership to see whether any red flags show up.
Evaluating (And Celebrating) 
Your Annual Fund Drive
Going through a debriefing process can be helpful not only to give your annual 
fund team some closure, but also to provide next year’s team with information 
on what worked, what didn’t, and where improvements can be made.
 
Before you finish a campaign, make a point to identify the people who seem 
to be stepping forward as leaders for the next one. Some large organizations 
help new leaders learn the ropes by identifying future leaders two years in 
advance. For example, an incoming leader may serve in a support role to the 
current leader to figure out how the campaign is run; then next year, the new 
leader knows what’s expected and can run a great campaign.
Your evaluation of your campaign can include the following questions:
 
✓ Did we meet our financial goals?
 
✓ Did we meet the goals we had for the number of prospects and donors 
contacted?
 
✓ What was our response rate in direct mail and telephone solicitation?
 
✓ Which fundraising tools were most effective?
 
✓ Was our team prepared and provided with the tools they needed?
 
✓ How effective was our annual fund leadership?
 
✓ What were the three biggest factors in the success of the drive?
 
✓ What were the three biggest challenges we faced?
 
✓ If we were starting this campaign again today, what would we change?
 
After you finish your evaluation, don’t forget to take time to celebrate! 
Celebrating is an important part of the annual fund process. You need to thank 
all your volunteers, recognize extraordinary efforts, and praise people all 
around. After all, the seeds you plant today may germinate and grow into the 
annual fund team you have tomorrow.

276
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
One big celebration you can’t afford to miss is the big thank-you event. Find a 
way to get everyone who helped put on your annual campaign together one 
last time — even if the “event” is a clean-up day at your facility or a free trip to 
a ball game. Telling people thanks in person is an important part of letting your 
volunteers know you truly value the time and effort they contributed. And, feel-
ing appreciated, they’ll be that much more likely to want to help you next year.
Planning for Next Time
One of the challenges of the annual fund is that it really is an ongoing process. 
It may feel like as soon as you finish one campaign, it’s time to start another! 
But don’t be overwhelmed. By taking a deep breath and bringing your board 
and committee together to plan early for next year, you can make your next 
annual fund campaign even more effective than the one you just finished.
 
Here are a few ideas to help you get started on planning for your next annual 
fund campaign:
 
✓ Spend some time discussing what worked in the current campaign. Look 
at the numbers, and review the experiences of volunteers and the board. 
Was your leadership effective? Did leadership have everything it needed 
to run a good campaign? Make a list of the items that worked well and 
put them in your plan for next year.
 
✓ Talk about the things that didn’t go so well. Where did your plan fall flat? 
Did you reach your financial goal? How many new prospects did you 
bring in? Explore the pitfalls your fund experienced, and discuss ideas 
that could — in hindsight — have helped avoid them. Write down the 
challenges your campaign faced and your responses to them, and put 
them in the file for next year so your next leadership team has the ben-
efit of your experienced view.
 
✓ Prepare a detailed budget-to-actual analysis to determine how accu-
rately you budgeted for the expenses of the annual fund campaign and 
what kind of result your efforts produced.
 
✓ Think carefully about the leadership for your campaign, and plan out the 
types of resources your leaders need to be successful next year. Make 
a list of resources to provide, and schedule a planning meeting for the 
next annual fund well in advance of the kick-off date.
 
✓ Most importantly — know that the planning energy you invest now will 
help your next annual fund go more smoothly and be more effective. 
Remember that you’re already on your way to your next annual campaign!

W
hen you say special event, people often think of black-tie, high-
society events with fancy catered food and a fine orchestra. Although 
major organizations hold these black-tie events regularly (and with finesse), 
there are many different types of special events — with different costs and 
constituencies — you can plan to raise funds for your organization without 
overwhelming your budget.
When considering what type of special event you want to throw, one of the 
first questions you have to ask yourself in tough times is: “Is this appropri-
ate for the economy we’re operating in?” Maybe a lower-cost event would be 
more suitable, considering the economic climate in which you’re operating. 
Your donors are more likely to support a mission-focused event when times 
are tough. Or maybe you’ve scaled back the event over the last few years, 
and now the local economy has recovered enough that you can kick your 
plans up a notch.
In this chapter, you discover how a special event, done well, can raise visibil-
ity for your organization and how it can mean substantial fundraising bucks 
down the road. The key to planning a successful special event is to have a 
person who wants to champion the event, a committee to plan and execute it, 
and enough time to find the right event and pull it together.

Seeing How a Special Event 
Benefits Your Organization
Put simply, a fundraising special event is an experience that brings people 
together, raises awareness for your cause, and gives you an opportunity to 
ask for donations. The event can be anything from a celebrity car wash to a 
walk-a-thon to a kissing contest to an evening of ballroom dancing.
The advantages of hosting a special event go beyond money raised. The 
single biggest benefit of a special event is raising awareness. Through your 
publicity efforts — and hopefully by word of mouth — people in your com-
munity become aware of your organization. Raised awareness benefits you in 
a number of ways, including the following:
 
✓ Increases your prospective donor list
 
✓ Involves donors as volunteers, giving them the chance to form a closer 
relationship with your organization
 
✓ Expands media coverage
 
✓ Raises funds, the amount depending on the type of event — expensive 
events may yield less financial gain
 
How big does your special event need to be? Only as big as your budget and 
community support. Because the focus of a special event is more about build-
ing awareness than raising money, the selection of the event itself is more 
important than the money spent on that event. Know where your break-even 
point is and keep focused on how the special event benefits your organization. 
If you steer by those two items, you will find it easier to make choices that 
help keep your costs within reasonable limits.
Planning, Planning, Planning!
As with most things, the secret to a good special event is in the planning. If 
you want your event to be truly special, detailed and thorough planning is a 
must because a single misstep could sink your results. If you’re ready for the 
event and do it well, you maximize awareness in your community, build good-
will with your volunteers, have fun, and raise money. If you’re not ready, an 
event that unravels can give the community the impression that your organi-
zation doesn’t manage itself well, which can be a devastating perception for 
agencies trying to build credibility and trust.
Planning your special event involves making the following decisions right at 
the start:

279
 Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event
 
✓ Who takes the lead? Which volunteers serve on the committee?
 
✓ What kind of event do you have? Whom does it reach? How do you 
reach those people?
 
✓ What do you want to accomplish? Are you raising awareness, money, 
goodwill, or all three?
 
✓ Can you afford to do a special event at this time? Do you have enough 
lead time for successful planning?
 
✓ What is the break-even point for your organization, and can you get a 
sponsor to offset the expense?
The following sections contain specifics to help you answer these questions.
Putting together the best team
The right leader (one who is enthusiastic, engaging, persuasive, and passion-
ate) can energize your volunteer group. With the right leader, people want to 
help, and the event becomes a major team-building activity.
With the wrong leader — someone who looks at the event as a chore or 
someone who is already overcommitted, lacking the time or energy to take 
on another duty — the event looms as a continual albatross around the neck 
of your organization. Because leadership is so vital to a successful event, 
postpone your plans for a special event until you have just the right leader to 
forge ahead with heart and soul. A lukewarm event drains your organization’s 
financial and volunteer resources and becomes a negative experience that 
nobody wants to attend.
As you begin to put together your special-event team, select a committee 
chair who
 
✓ Has the time to commit to the effort
 
✓ Has people skills to motivate others
 
✓ Understands and is able to communicate the vision
 
✓ Has some fundraising and event experience
 
✓ Has passion for the mission of your organization
After you choose a team leader, it’s time to put together the rest of your 
team. Your special-event committee should consist of volunteers who
 
✓ Love to get out there and promote your cause with enthusiasm
 
✓ Get things done
 
✓ Can work as a team to pull the event together

280
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
Be sure to provide enough lead time before the event (see the section “Setting 
a timeline” later in this chapter for details). The committee needs to meet 
monthly at first to solidify the plan and keep it in motion. As the event draws 
near, the committee may meet weekly to ensure that all aspects of the event 
are under control.
Selecting an event
The type of special event you choose to put on is just as important as the 
people you choose to lead it. Is the event linked logically to your organiza-
tion’s mission? Will the people who care about your cause sit up and take 
notice of the event?
Here are some guidelines for choosing the right event:
 
✓ Look for an event that’s a logical fit with your organization’s mission.
 
✓ Think about who you want to attend your event — and why.
 
✓ Know the net return you want to get from the evening.
 
✓ Consider how you can get exposure from the local press for the event.
 
✓ Be aware of the budget for special events and stay within your means.
Involve the people your organization serves in your special event. One 
mental health association nearly always includes in the audience people who 
have received their services. At first, other audience members did a double 
take to see clients in the audience, but including clients in the celebration 
shows that the organization means what it says about encouraging the rights 
and dignity of the people it serves.
The growing special event
Some events become annual events and grow 
precisely because they’re annual events. For 
example, some organizations have an annual 
silent auction or dance. The anticipation and 
repeat promotion of the event from year to year 
helps the community recognize the organization 
and the cause.
One special event started by the Indianapolis 
Zoo as a way to bring more people to the zoo 
has grown into a major special event for the 
city. Zoobilation, which raises close to half 
a million dollars each year, has become the 
social event of the year for young couples. 
Attendees dress in formal wear — they come 
in ball gowns, tuxedos, and, occasionally, 
safari gear. The event now features five differ-
ent bands and food from 20 local restaurants. 
Demand has grown to a point that tickets sell 
out every year well in advance of the event — 
even in a down economy.

281
 Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event
Deciding the when and where
After you select the event leadership and the event itself, you need to decide 
when and where you want to host it. As far as the when is concerned, select 
the date and time of the event after carefully considering the wants and 
needs — and schedules — of your target audience. Here are some questions 
that can help you determine the when for your special event:
 
✓ What time of year fits logically with your organization’s mission? For 
example, a program that raises donations for holiday gifts for kids may 
have its special event the weekend after Thanksgiving, when the holiday 
buying season officially begins.
 
✓ What else is going on in town at that time? What other obligations 
may your audience have? For example, if you schedule your fundraiser 
when the big city orchestra hosts its black-tie ball, you may lose some of 
your higher-level donors.
 
✓ Do you know of a time of year when you’re likely to get more help 
than others? If many of your volunteers go to Florida for the winter, 
for example, you may wind up having that Valentine’s Day dance all by 
yourself. Remember that your volunteers are an important part of the 
overall success of the event — both for the word-of-mouth publicity they 
offer and for the team-building experiences they have.
Equally important may be the where. Be sure the where is logically con-
nected to your organization. For example, why have a school-related special 
event at a location other than the school? As you consider the where for your 
event, ask yourself these key questions:
 
✓ Where in your town can people get to easily and park near? Logistics 
can kill your event. If people can’t get to the event easily, they won’t 
come.
 
✓ What locale fits the event? For example, if you’re throwing a black-tie 
event, don’t hold it at a soup kitchen in the inner city. If your event 
involves art, a museum or theater makes sense. Just make sure the 
venue matches the mood and is a destination that’s attractive to your 
potential donors.
 
✓ Is the location in your budget? Renting a swank country club for a 
black-tie event may be swell, but can you afford it? Your potential 
donors don’t want to see you bleeding money for the sake of a fund-
raiser. Look for someone to donate a locale or swap it for free, positive 
publicity.
 
One of the best kinds of events revolves around people’s homes. For example, 
an art museum has a progressive dinner for major donors at six different 
homes. Being invited to participate in the dinner is seen as an extra-special 
thing. The people who open their homes for the dinners contribute everything 

282
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
from the food to the dinnerware. Involve your board and volunteer leadership 
in your special-event initiatives to inspire others to increase their engagement 
with your organization.
Setting expectations
Clearly, making a mountain of money isn’t a realistic expectation of your first 
fundraiser. After you put together your special-event committee, spend some 
time discussing and carefully thinking through the goals for your event. How 
will you measure your success? Keep in mind that realistic goals help you set 
a realistic budget.
As you consider what expectations you have for your special event, you 
may want to set goals for the number of people attending, cost per person, 
the coverage you get in the media, the number of volunteers involved, the 
amount of money you raise, and the overall happiness quotient.
 
What exactly do we mean by happiness quotient? How can you rate people’s 
happiness with the event? It’s quite simple. Set a scale from 1 to 5. People 
with a happiness quotient of 1 leave the event looking seriously bored or 
disgruntled. People with a happiness quotient of 5 leave the event looking 
euphorically happy, singing the praises of your organization all the way down 
the street. Include volunteer and staff reactions in the happiness quotient, too. 
The 1-to-5 scale isn’t a scientific method of tracking event results, but the good 
feeling that results from a successful event may be the single biggest lasting 
effect your efforts make in the year to come.
Budgeting for the special event
As you plan your special event, don’t forget the budget. Even if the goal of 
your event is mainly to generate awareness and goodwill, the event shouldn’t 
break the bank. If your organization has a history of special events, you prob-
ably already have a hefty allotment for this year’s event. If you’re putting on 
a first-time event or are trying a new event that presents new costs, you need 
to be mindful of the upfront investment involved in setting up services and 
reaching your target audience.
As your special-event committee works with the budget, be sure to prepare 
for expenses in each of the following areas:
 
✓ Facility (rental fees, insurance, permits, lighting)
 
✓ Parking (parking-lot fees, valet fees)
 
✓ Equipment (tables and chairs, audio-visual equipment, tents)
 
✓ Services (catering, housekeeping, transportation, security)

283
 Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event
 
✓ Entertainment (speakers’ fees, performers’ fees, band fees)
 
✓ Publications (invitations, flyers, posters, tickets, banners, thank-you 
cards)
 
✓ Decorations (table centerpieces, flowers, balloons)
 
✓ Recognition (gifts, cards, discount tickets, plaques, pins)
 
Remember, even if you do have a healthy budget for special events, you don’t 
have to use all of it. Try to attain sponsorship for as many components of the 
event as you can — from the napkins to the catering to the limo service for 
your entertainers.
Setting a timeline
How far in advance do you need to plan your special event? Many organiza-
tions begin planning for next year’s event the same day they evaluate the 
one they just had. If you do a repeat event every year, this process is fairly 
simple. If you’re starting from scratch and putting together a brand-new 
event, you need all the time you can get. So if you can begin planning a year 
before the event takes place, do so.
Suppose that you’re going to put on a gala with a catered dinner, a speaker, 
and dancing. You hope for the black-tie and evening-gown crowd. If you pro-
cess the staging of the special event, you can break the pieces down into a 
timeline that helps you stay on track and get everything done in a comfort-
able time frame.
Here’s an example of a timeline for a special event that will occur in July of 
next year:
 
✓ August: Begin planning; select the event committee; hold your first 
committee meeting; select the speaker and theme. Follow with monthly 
committee meetings (with more frequent meetings as you get closer to 
the event) to keep the momentum going.
 
✓ September: Divide tasks among the committee. Contact the speaker. 
Determine the location and equipment needed. Remember to consider 
permits, security, and insurance.
 
✓ October: Draft the agenda for the evening. Be specific, writing down what 
you want to happen from start to finish in 15- to 30-minute increments.
 
✓ November: Identify potential sponsorships and create a plan to pursue 
them.
 
✓ December: Identify potential participants from your donor list and the 
community at large. Begin to pursue sponsorships.
 
✓ January: Contact food-service, housekeeping, and entertainment vendors.

284
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
✓ February: Approve the menu; select the music.
 
✓ March: Print invitations, flyers, and tickets. Finalize your publicity plan.
 
✓ April: Do a reality check. How much will this event cost? What kind of 
return do you anticipate? Gauge the general interest for the event and 
determine whether, in light of your budget and your objectives, you 
need to adjust your plan or move forward.
 
✓ May: Start publicizing your event; organize your volunteers; send invita-
tions (the last week of May).
 
✓ June: Coordinate all elements of the event; divide into work teams or 
groups; practice a run-through; do a last-minute function check of the 
facility — housekeeping, food services, sound system, audio-visual 
equipment (projectors), and entertainment.
 
✓ July: Put on the event! Don’t forget follow-up activities, such as sending 
thank-you notes to volunteers, hosts, and donors, and beginning to lay 
the groundwork for next year’s successful event.
With sufficient time and detailed planning, your event should go off without a 
hitch. Relax and enjoy it!
Black Tie Optional: Organizing 
an Online Event
These days it’s possible to hold interactive events from your Web site. You 
can hold a seminar during which you present information about your cause 
that interests your donors. Or you can hold an online event (perhaps using a 
Webcast) with a special draw, such as a celebrity chat, during which attendees 
can submit questions and watch and hear the celebrity respond in real time.
Online events won’t be as splashy as a black-tie dinner, but they are virtually 
free ways to keep your name in front of people on a much more regular basis.
Using Webinars to inform and persuade
Does your organization collect funds to save the rain forest? What about 
giving an online travelogue presentation about the rain forest and its various 
birds and beasts? Are you an arts group preparing for your annual Christmas 
show? You can use different programs to easily create behind-the-scenes 
photo albums, video clips, or Webinars that tell people more about your 
organization and its cause and programs.

285
 Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event
Webinars are new, low-cost ways to bring potential donors together for an 
online meeting. During a Webinar, you can offer a presentation, run a video, 
chat about a program, show a slide show, and much more. Your donors log in 
to the specific site where the Webinar will be held and then call in to partici-
pate in the discussion. This type of online event enables you to gather people 
together around your cause without incurring the costs of hosting a larger, 
physical event.
If you want to make the Webinar a real online event, you can invite a book 
author or researcher in your industry area to host the Webinar and invite key 
donors to the online event. You can raise funds before the event by charging 
for tickets or invite participants to make a gift offering at the close of the event.
 
Many Webinar services, such as www.GoToMeeting.com, enable you to save 
the Webinar transcript so that others who can’t attend the actual online event 
can view the file or receive the information later.
Chatting online with celebrities
If you know someone with a big name who supports your cause but who 
doesn’t have the time to travel to an offline event, consider setting up an 
online chat. This format allows you to associate a famous name with your 
cause and to get that person to chat with your donors online. Designate 
someone from your organization as a moderator, and, if possible, allow visi-
tors to request an audio recording or transcript of the chat after it’s over. 
When you send them the saved chat, include a pitch for a donation.
 
It’s beyond the scope of this book to go into the technical ins and outs of set-
ting up online meetings and chats, but trust us — it’s not that difficult to do. 
Go to the online expert in your organization or ask a local Web design group 
to donate its time to set up one for you. With a simple-to-use online meeting 
product, such as Windows Live Meeting from Microsoft, you’ll be amazed at 
what you can do.
Following Up after the Big Event
The auditorium is empty. Confetti covers the floor; dishes, flatware, and 
crumpled napkins cover the tabletops. Soon the crew will arrive to disassem-
ble the furnishings and the tent. Your special event is over — or is it?
You may think there’s nothing left to do but go home and collapse from all 
the work of the past several months, but not so fast. Soon after the event, you 
need to figure out whether the event was successful, thank the volunteers 

286
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
and sponsors who helped out, and start thinking about next year’s event. The 
following sections outline how to wrap up the event and look ahead to the 
next one.
Measuring goodwill
The result of special events — both in the “real world” and online — can be 
all over the board, and the amount of money you raise in your special event 
may turn out to be secondary to the goodwill you generate. Because goodwill 
is hard to rate, you may walk away from the event wondering whether you hit 
your mark.
You can use the goals you set during the event-planning stages to help you 
determine whether you reached the desired objectives. You can also watch 
for longer-term positive results by being alert for the following:
 
✓ People smile as they leave.
 
✓ Your event is mentioned — in a positive way — in the paper or on social 
media sites.
 
✓ People mention to you that they heard about your event.
 
✓ You get an increase in calls and/or visits.
 
✓ People sign the guest book to get on your mailing list or fill out a pledge 
card at the event.
 
✓ You feel that the community has a better understanding of who you are.
 
✓ Participants send you thank-you notes.
 
✓ People ask you whether you plan to have the event again next year.
 
✓ Participants complete online surveys about the event they attended, and 
the feedback is largely positive.
Evaluating the event’s outcomes
When the dust begins to settle and you’ve recovered from the stress of put-
ting on your special event, take some time to evaluate your event. After all, 
learning from this one can help you run the next one more smoothly. Here 
are some of the questions that you — and your special-event committee — 
can ask as you evaluate:
 
✓ Did we meet the goals we set in the beginning?
 
✓ What kind of publicity did we get?

287
 Chapter 19: Planning a Special Event
 
✓ How many new people did we reach?
 
✓ What was our per-plate (or per-participant) cost?
 
✓ Did we use all possible means to publicize the event?
 
✓ Did we raise any money?
 
Is it possible to have a good event without raising any money? Yes! Although 
you may put on your special event with the objective of raising substantial 
funds, the more direct benefit is the exposure you get and the awareness you 
raise for your organization and its cause. The money comes, over time, as a 
result of these other benefits.
 
Same time next year? Depending on whom you ask, some event planners feel 
that having the same event several years in row is important to help brand the 
event in the mind of the community. Although this approach works well for 
some organizations (especially those that know they’ve selected an event that 
fits well with their mission), an argument can be made for not repeating an 
event that clearly didn’t work. If your event was a royal flop, don’t buy into the 
argument that you really need to give it three years before you see any kind of 
return on your investment. A good rule of thumb, especially for organizations 
on a shoestring, is to do more of what works and do less of what doesn’t.
Saying “Thank you!”
Whether you plan to repeat your event next year or not, don’t forget the last 
step! Say “Thank you!” to everyone involved. As anyone who has ever been 
through a special event can tell you, the thanking is no small feat. It requires 
your heartfelt recognition of the various parts of the whole, from the person 
who stuffed the invitation envelopes to the catering manager who oversaw 
the meal and dessert to the volunteer who desktop-published the flyers in 
her spare time.
How do you thank all your participants? Here are just a few ideas:
 
✓ A personal visit to the volunteer to say, “Thanks!”
 
✓ A phone call and a follow-up letter
 
✓ A personal letter to the helper
 
✓ A thank-you luncheon for everyone involved
 
✓ A group thank-you in the next agency newsletter (which is a good idea 
to do in conjunction with another form of recognition)
Remember that the ladder of effectiveness ranges from personal contact to 
impersonal contact, but the biggest thank-you comes from you, personally.

288
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
It’s easy to leave out a name or two in your thank-you list, but doing so isn’t 
acceptable. As you move through the planning stages and the event itself, 
make sure that everyone involved in the planning keeps a list of the people 
who helped throughout the planning for the event. Then, when the event’s 
over, just pull out your list and go through the thank-yous one by one.
Gathering event lessons for next time
Evaluating what worked and what didn’t for your special event is an impor-
tant part of the planning for next year. Within a few weeks after finishing and 
celebrating your event, get the board together for a debriefing. You may want 
to take half a day to discuss your thoughts on the following questions:
 
✓ What did we learn from this event?
 
✓ Whom did we identify as our leader for next year’s event?
 
✓ What worked and what can we improve next year?
 
✓ Did this event really connect with our donors?
 
✓ Did we use all available methods to publicize the event?
 
✓ Did the event accomplish what we intended it to accomplish? Should we 
do it again, as we did this year, or should we try something different?
 
✓ When should we have our first planning meeting for next year’s special 
event?
Whether or not this year’s event was the fulfillment of all your event hopes, 
you can learn valuable lessons from the experience. Your increased knowl-
edge of your donors, your economic climate, your volunteer base, and your 
organization’s ability to host special events will all contribute to making 
future events even more successful than this one.

Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, 
and Futures: The Capital Campaign
In This Chapter
▶ Getting ready to run a capital campaign
▶ Designating a leader for your capital campaign
▶ Following through each step of the campaign
W
hen you think growth, think capital. Capital means big money — 
enough to build a building or provide income for your programs for 
many years to come. A capital campaign is the biggest campaign your organi-
zation can ever undertake. This type of campaign requires a massive, all-out 
planning effort to secure large amounts of money for a specific purpose.
Understandably, launching into this type of campaign takes considerable 
thought and planning any time, but planning is especially important in times 
of economic challenge. Even if you have a long-term physical development 
plan in place, pay attention to the economic landscape and weigh out your 
chances of running a successful campaign. Take the time to discuss options 
thoughtfully with your board before you move full-speed into your capital 
campaign.
This chapter helps you think through all the basics, including timing, involved 
with planning and implementing a capital campaign. Of all the advice we can 
give you on this topic, here’s the most important: Be sure that your organiza-
tion is ready to take this step. A premature capital campaign can do more 
harm than good, so make sure you organize a capital campaign that has the 
support and enthusiasm of both the fundraisers and the planners.

290
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Gearing Up for the Big Campaign
Generally, you use the capital campaign to bring in special funds over and 
above your operating budget (which is the money-eating animal you feed with 
your annual fund). A capital campaign raises the funds for the new wing of your 
hospital, the new program for teen mothers, or the funding of an endowment 
that supports the chair of your philosophy department (more on endowments 
in the “Checking out endowment campaigns” section later in this chapter).
Most capital campaigns share the following characteristics:
 
✓ The campaign encompasses a massive, organized fundraising effort.
 
✓ The campaign is designed to raise a specific amount for a specific need.
 
✓ The campaign cycle stretches over a long but specific time frame.
 
✓ Lead gifts make up half the campaign’s fundraising goal. Lead gifts are 
dependent on face-to-face solicitation. (We talk more about lead gifts in 
the “Identifying lead gifts and challenge gifts” section.)
 
✓ Donors pledge large gifts to be paid over a multiyear period.
If you’ve determined that your organization is ready to implement a capital 
campaign to meet its current and future needs, how can you be sure that now 
is the right time to start such a campaign? Part of the answer to this question 
depends on the enthusiasm of your supporters. If your supporters are excited 
about the new library you plan to add, you have a ready corps of volunteers 
who will tell your campaign story with passion. (Let prudence be your guide 
here — as John says, “You don’t have to have a building to do good things.”)
The other part of the answer to the timing question involves circling the 
wagons before you proceed with your capital campaign to find out whether 
your major givers are still on board. Find out how your big givers feel about 
the timing of the campaign. Be clear that you’re not talking about ending the 
campaign altogether but rather exploring the right timing for it.
Your major givers will be the ones giving you the lead gifts for your cam-
paign, so it’s important to know how they feel about the campaign’s feasibil-
ity in light of the current economic landscape. Although the donors who give 
to a capital campaign are, in general, not as severely impacted by economic 
changes as your other donors, you may want to consider offering an exten-
sion on pledge payments — extending a three-year pledge to five years, for 
example — to accommodate the needs of your major donors.
 
Running a capital campaign every year is the fundraising equivalent of forcing 
your giving well to run dry. Capital campaigns should be, by their nature, rare, 
which is why you need to think carefully through your decision to run one.

291
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
Exploring Capital Campaign Types
The needs of your organization determine the type of capital campaign you 
develop. In general, your intention is the same — you need to raise a large 
amount of money for a substantial need. Like ice cream, capital campaigns 
come in several common flavors (which we discuss in the following sections):
 
✓ Bricks-and-mortar campaigns
 
✓ Endowment campaigns
 
✓ Project campaigns
 
✓ Combined campaigns
In some special circumstances, organizations have been known to create 
capital campaigns to help fund special equipment. For example, one organiza-
tion John works with launched a major capital campaign to fund exhibits for 
a newly renovated state museum. But this type of campaign is rare enough 
that we don’t spend a lot of time on it here.
Building bricks-and-mortar campaigns
The bricks-and-mortar capital campaign is probably what most people think 
of when they hear the term capital campaign. A bricks-and-mortar campaign 
raises money for tangible things, such as a new wing for your hospital, a new 
school, a new library, or improvements to a community center. Whether 
you’re renovating an old structure or building an entirely new one, a capital 
campaign brings in the high-level funds you need to meet your goal.
 
Many foundations and other funding entities these days exclude bricks-and-
mortar capital campaigns from their giving agendas. Be sure to check to see 
whether a foundation or other source of money is receptive to capital cam-
paign proposals before you bother to write one up.
 
Raising funds before a building is built is much easier to do than raising funds 
to pay for it after it’s been built. Why? People love to be part of dreaming a 
dream and watching it come to fruition.
Checking out endowment campaigns
Another kind of capital campaign is the endowment campaign, a campaign 
in which the money raised is used to invest in your organization’s future 
instead of in a new building. With an endowment, a donor pledges a substan-
tial gift that’s given over a period of several years; sometimes the interest or 

292
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
appreciation of the assets can sustain a program over several years. Many 
grantor foundations were built through endowments of their own. A gift to an 
endowment campaign typically goes into a fund for ongoing support of spe-
cific programs.
 
Endowments are often the result of planned-giving instruments or bequests. 
See Chapter 21 for more about planned giving.
The one thing all endowments have in common is that they’re large enough 
to be able to generate significant income from the principal. You can gener-
ate income from an endowment in several different ways. One form of endow-
ment allows organizations to make use of the interest earned each year on 
the endowment balance. Another endowment form may allow organizations 
to draw down a fixed percent of the value of the endowment each year. This 
idea is based on the fact that endowments normally earn interest and gain 
additional value through appreciation. In difficult economic times, endow-
ments don’t always do so; as a result, the management of the endowment has 
to decide what the appropriate amount is to draw down. (Turn to Chapter 23 
for more details about endowments.)
 
Regardless of the type of capital campaign you choose to run, remember 
that big gifts create big names and, not coincidentally, that big names create 
big gifts. Use naming opportunities to attract and recognize your high-level 
givers, giving them a publicized stake in your organization’s mission for 
today and tomorrow. Just think — each time your high-level donors come to 
visit their namesake buildings, they’re reminded of the importance of their 
generous gifts.
Putting together project campaigns
A project campaign is another type of capital campaign, but it has a narrower 
focus than either the bricks-and-mortar campaign or the endowment cam-
paign. This type of capital campaign raises funds for a program that requires 
a specific amount of money for a specific time. For example, suppose that 
you’re currently serving 15 teenagers in your teen parenting program, and 
you need to increase that number to 25. To do so, you need more physical 
space, more funds allotted to the annual fund, more program materials, and 
more personnel. You can use the same planning you do for a larger capital 
campaign to accomplish your goals in a more focused project campaign.
Running combined campaigns
A combined campaign orchestrates all your needs in a single plan — bricks 
and mortar, program goals, equipment, and even the annual fund may all be 
interwoven with the overall combined campaign goals. If you want to see a 

293
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
combined campaign at its finest, look at any major university. Universities 
are quickly mastering the techniques for weaving together the goals of com-
bined campaigns.
 
Unless you’re part of an institution that has substantial giving bases and 
naming possibilities, think long and hard before you try your hand at a com-
bined campaign; running a successful one is very hard to do without the 
donor foundation that many large institutions already have in place. Many 
donors — especially in times of economic hardship — think, “I gave to the 
building campaign, so I’m not going to give to the annual fund.” You don’t 
want to jeopardize your operating fund because you launch a capital cam-
paign at a time when your donors can’t support it.
Selecting a Champion
In any capital campaign, leadership is everything. The person you select to 
head the campaign — called the campaign chairperson or leader — often 
makes the difference between achieving your goal and falling short. The 
successful capital campaign is a thoroughly planned event that requires a 
leader with vision, experience, and the connections and means to secure the 
highest-level lead gifts possible. (Lead gifts are major pledges that come in 
early and really start your campaign rolling. We talk more about them later in 
the “Identifying lead gifts and challenge gifts” section.)
The best approach for choosing a campaign leader is selecting someone from 
your board because your board members are dedicated to your mission, are 
familiar with the workings of the board, and are committed to the long-term 
success of the organization. After choosing a leader, don’t forget that you 
need to select dedicated volunteers to serve on the committee, as well. As 
you begin to select committee members, consider these characteristics:
 
✓ Commitment to the mission of the organization
 
✓ Position in the community
 
✓ Experience with the organization
 
✓ Ability and willingness to give
Each of these characteristics is vitally important. The dedication and com-
mitment your committee members show toward your organization serve as a 
model for all your volunteers and supporters. The visibility of the people you 
choose helps to inspire others in the community who admire those people 
and may attract new donors and supporters to your cause. When your com-
mittee members have experience with your organization, you already have 
that relational link you try so hard to build — they’re already engaged with 
the work you do and feel good about being part of your mission.

294
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
In a capital campaign, each of your committee members must be a giving 
member. After all, the members of the capital campaign committee have 
much more credibility as they go face to face with potentially high-level 
donors when they can back up their donation requests with their own giving 
experience and the giving experiences of the organization’s board members. 
As we explain in Chapter 10, “the Ask” is more powerful if, for example, when 
your committee member invites Bob to make a donation, she can say, “Bob, 
our board consists of 14 members, and we have each contributed between 
$3,000 and $50,000.”
Staging the Campaign
Planning is a particularly high priority in a capital campaign because of the 
campaign’s sheer scope. Don’t start before you’re ready, or your results will 
reflect your hasty actions.
Before you launch the capital campaign, you may want to create a capital 
planning committee to evaluate the institution’s readiness for a capital cam-
paign. This committee may hire an outside firm to do a feasibility study; it 
may also identify and cultivate prospective high-level givers. The planning 
committee shares the study’s report with your campaign’s leadership, and 
your campaign committee makes any decisions necessary to implement the 
planning committee’s plan.
 
You may need to organize more than one committee to take care of each step 
of the campaign process because the planning and implementation of a capital 
campaign involves so much time and effort.
Planning and implementing a capital campaign usually involves the following 
stages:
 
1. Readiness: Determine whether your organization is really ready to 
launch a capital campaign. You can do so yourself or use an outside 
agency to make sure your basic fundraising structure is in place and 
functioning before you take on the massive and very public capital cam-
paign. Making sure your organization is ready to withstand the hurdles 
of the capital campaign before you start is extremely important because 
the outcome of your capital campaign — whether you pass the goal with 
flying colors or you fall flat on your face — can have an impact on the 
public perception of your organization for years to come.
 
2. Testing: Identify key potential donors of influence in your area, and get 
their opinions on the readiness, practicality, and appeal of your campaign.
 
3. Setup: Put in place the basic organizing systems, such as research, 
record keeping, staffing, and so on, in preparation for the campaign.

295
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
 
 Don’t forget about the additional maintenance and ongoing expenses 
you incur because of this new campaign. Those expenses end up becom-
ing part of your annual fund’s requirement. If your campaign involves 
creating an endowment, you won’t have a lot of additional expense 
beyond staff time. But if you’re working on a capital campaign for a 
building, you have to account for considerable additional expenses. 
Think through every part of your capital campaign and plan accordingly.
 
4. In-house preparations: Finalize your case statement, develop materials, 
train committees, solicit challenge gifts, and recruit volunteers. The case 
statement for this kind of campaign includes elements from your regular 
case statement, but it probably includes elements specific to this new 
purpose, as well.
 
5. Lead gifts: Have your committee members acquire lead gifts from board 
members, individuals, corporations, and foundations.
 
6. Public fundraising: Publicly announce your capital campaign (when you 
have acquired pledges for more than 50 percent of your goal), and build 
the public-solicitation portion of your campaign.
 
7. Completion and evaluation: Focus on smaller gifts and bring the cam-
paign to a close, evaluating the entire process, managing recognitions, 
and making suggestions for improvement in the next campaign.
Note that much of the work of the capital campaign is actually done behind 
the scenes during the first five stages of planning. The campaign only goes 
public in Stage 6, when you’ve reached more than 50 percent of your cam-
paign goal. We talk about these stages in more detail in the following sections.
Testing the waters: Campaign feasibility
Testing for readiness is a major part of the success of the capital campaign. Is 
your organization ready? Is your board ready? Is the public ready? Many fac-
tors, both internal and external, affect the overall success or failure of your 
campaign.
 
Delaying a campaign doesn’t have to send a negative message to your 
constituents. Making a prudent decision in tough times can demonstrate to 
your donors that you’re discerning the best time to move forward with your 
plans — which, we might add, is good stewardship.
Many organizations rely on consulting firms to do feasibility studies as they 
prepare major campaigns. Having people outside your organization evalu-
ate your organization’s readiness to start a capital campaign enables those 
people interviewed to be open and honest in their responses. If a person 
from your organization asks another person from your organization 

296
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
questions like “Do you think our organization is ready for this campaign? Do 
you think the goal is realistic?” the person from your organization may not 
feel free to answer candidly.
You can also rely on the objectivity of the outside consultant to recommend 
whether now is truly the time for a major campaign. Someone inside the orga-
nization who’s excited about the prospect of a capital campaign, on the other 
hand, may push for a major campaign before the time is right.
In general, a feasibility study helps you do the following:
 
✓ Determine whether your case statement is solid.
 
✓ Evaluate your board’s readiness.
 
✓ Test the overall campaign goal.
 
✓ Test whether donor record-keeping systems are ready for a capital 
campaign.
 
✓ Test your markets for giving and develop a giving pyramid for the cam-
paign (see Chapter 6 for more on the giving pyramid).
Your feasibility study may also let you know how your organization’s messag-
ing is being received by potential givers. Your committee may feel the appeal 
is right, but your testing may show that your organization’s message needs to 
be altered or augmented to some extent. In the process of testing your mes-
sage, you may find another market, as well. For example, the feasibility study 
for a zoo showed that a growing portion of the donor base cared deeply 
about preservation issues, so the zoo launched a new initiative targeted to 
this specific interest. In this way, asking the right questions at the right time 
can help you discover something new that may have enormous appeal to 
your donors.
 
Even if you’re a three-person shop, do a feasibility study before you launch a 
major campaign. Although your study may not be something coordinated by a 
national consulting firm, you need to test your case statement, your goals, and 
your giving pyramid with a number of high-level donors.
It’s okay to go out to your stakeholders and say, “Here’s what our board is 
talking about. Does this sound feasible to you?” Take along a questionnaire 
and do the interview in person. Doing so builds the donor-organization rela-
tionship and makes the donor feel as though she has really helped.
This type of interview accomplishes another goal, as well: The interview and 
the questions you ask often give you a sense of which pitches are most and 
least desirable in the minds of your donors. The interview helps you decide 
which appeals to leave out of the overall plan.

297
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
 
Sometimes a feasibility test lets you know that you’re trying to do too many 
things at once. If the recommendation that you need to divide your cam-
paign into smaller segments comes back from the feasibility test, don’t 
despair. Instead, look at it as an opportunity to celebrate a greater number 
of successes.
 
If you’ve never hired a consultant before and need some help exploring your 
options, you can contact your local community foundation for ideas or ask 
other nonprofits for names of consultants they’ve used. If you work for a small 
nonprofit, you don’t need to hire a national consulting firm; you may be able 
to find a local consultant who can bring just what you need.
Setting your goal
Setting the goal for your capital campaign may be the subject of long and 
hard debate. You hear the clashes between risk takers and stability; you see 
the different priorities and definitions of a number of people who care about 
the organization and want to see it grow in the right direction. The financial 
goal for the capital campaign is wrapped up in the vision and agenda of many 
individuals, so be prepared to deal with a lot of discussion before you finalize 
your capital campaign goal.
When you arrive at a consensus about the amount of money you need to 
raise and the realistic possibility of attaining it, test the number. In interviews 
with donors during your feasibility tests, ask people questions like “Do you 
think this is a realistic amount?” Listen carefully to the responses and evalu-
ate them. If you get too many noes, go back to the discussion table with the 
responses, and reevaluate your position.
 
If your organization regularly undertakes major campaigns, cultivate the 
wisdom and experience of those involved in the experience by inviting all 
your previous campaign chairs to test the theme of your campaign and your 
overall goal.
Here are a few examples of capital campaign goals:
 
✓ Solicit large amounts.
 
✓ Stretch out pledges over multiple years.
 
✓ Use challenge and matching grants.
 
✓ Include corporations and foundations.
 
✓ Stress lead gifts.

298
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
The best-laid plans — especially when physical construction is involved — 
often overrun their boundaries. Be sure you create a contingency fund to take 
care of overages on projects and unexpected expenses. As a ballpark figure, 
plan on putting aside a minimum of 10 percent to handle those unexpected 
construction overruns.
Identifying lead gifts and challenge gifts
A lead gift is one of the first — and biggest — gifts you can expect during 
your campaign. Lead gifts take a lot of time and cultivation; you develop and 
solicit them strategically, over months (or perhaps years). A relatively low 
number of lead gifts comprise a high percentage of your overall fundraising 
goal. According to the Center for Philanthropy at Indiana University-Purdue 
University Indianapolis, the numbers break down like this:
 
✓ The top 10 to 15 gifts comprise the top 34 percent of your total goal.
 
✓ The next 75 to 100 gifts make up the next 33 percent of the goal.
 
✓ All other gifts make up only 33 percent of the total goal.
 
As Chapter 6 explains, a giving pyramid helps you plot out the number of 
major gifts you need to make your overall fundraising goal. This pyramid is 
extremely important in capital campaigns, as well, and can help you deter-
mine not only how many of each type of gift you need, but also the number of 
people you have to approach to reach your goal.
The first few gifts of a capital campaign are important pieces of your overall 
capital campaign strategy, but just who will be your first lead givers? Here 
are a few of the likeliest candidates:
 
✓ Board members: You must have a giving board to run a successful capi-
tal campaign.
 
✓ High-level donors: Your major givers in other areas of your fundraising 
program are also likely to step up to the plate with substantial gifts 
in your capital campaign. You need to think of gift incentives, such as 
naming opportunities and other forms of recognition, as well as a revital-
ized case statement that helps donors see why now is the right time to 
give that large gift.
 
✓ Stakeholders in business and philanthropy: Lead gifts may also come 
from the corporate or philanthropic community. Companies may be 
interested in sponsoring a portion of your campaign by providing a chal-
lenge gift that inspires others to give at a higher level. (See Chapter 22 
for more on soliciting corporate gifts.)

299
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
 
One of the most effective vehicles in a capital campaign is the challenge gift. A 
challenge gift is one in which a lead giver (an individual, a corporation, or a 
foundation) says something like, “I’ll give you $100,000 if you can get it 
matched by July 1, 2011.” This kind of gift enables you to go to other prospec-
tive high-level donors and say, “If you give now, your money will go twice as 
far.” Because of the matching funds, a donor who gives $25,000 gets the good 
feeling of knowing that his gift actually takes you $50,000 closer to your cam-
paign goal. See Chapter 21 for more about challenge gifts.
 
Before the economic roller coaster of 2007 through 2009, experts were esti-
mating that the largest transfer of wealth in history would soon be transfer-
ring from one generation to the next. Even though the economy has no doubt 
had a big impact on inheritances, you still have huge opportunities to solicit 
major gifts. (Check out Chapters 9, 10, and 21 for more about your major gift 
opportunities.)
After you’ve identified your prospects and put your goals and approaches in 
place, your fundraising for these larger lead gifts can involve all the fundrais-
ing techniques we discuss in Chapters 10 through 17. However, your donor 
prospect list is typically more targeted, the win for your efforts may be 
bigger, and the time you spend cultivating these big-hitter relationships can 
involve months or even years. Especially at this high level, the giving rela-
tionship between you and your donors is very important. Don’t be afraid to 
spend a considerable amount of time and effort developing a connection with 
a major giver before asking for a gift.
Going public
Suppose that you’ve completed the campaign plan and the consultants have 
told you the time is ripe for your capital campaign. So you pull your commit-
tees together, begin prospect research, gather your materials, and secure all 
the necessary lead gifts. You’re already two-thirds to your goal, and you’re 
certain you’re going to reach it. Now what do you do? Sit back and coast to 
the finish line? Nope. Now’s the time to go public with your campaign.
A successful capital campaign is a big boost for the morale of your sup-
porters and the public perception of your nonprofit organization. It says a 
number of things to the public at large:
 
✓ This organization knows what it’s doing.
 
✓ This organization is responsible with its money.
 
✓ Other people believe in this organization — look who’s giving!
 
✓ This organization is worth a lot — look at the size of its goal!
 
✓ This organization is doing good work.

300
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Each of these messages is important in a dollars-and-sense kind of way. 
Because fundraising is more about relationships than it is about money, and 
because relationships are built on trust, which is built on credibility, you 
have a great opportunity to further the trustworthiness of your organization 
by taking a successful capital campaign public. The more trustworthy your 
organization is, the more people will want to identify with you. To go public 
with your campaign, you need the following in place:
 
✓ A spokesperson (perhaps your campaign chairperson)
 
✓ Visual aids (such as a beautiful rendering of the finished building, with 
the parts not yet funded only penciled in)
 
✓ Printed materials (brochures, pledge cards, flyers, and so on)
 
✓ E-mail lists and a Web site, as well as social media accounts with 
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter
 
✓ Media contacts, such as radio, television, and the Internet
 
✓ Donors willing to say why they believe in your organization
Make sure you prepare for going public in your campaign plan. Most impor-
tantly, be sure you’ve budgeted the necessary funds, prepared and printed 
the necessary materials, and established the ground rules for your publicity 
effort. See Chapter 13 for more about working with the media.
Following up with your capital campaign
Your campaign has been a success. So, how do you wind down the cam-
paign? The key is follow-up.
As you bring the public campaign to a close, you need to organize the follow-
ing to make sure the gifts promised are delivered and the goodwill created 
continues:
 
✓ Effective and quick responses to gifts from all donors
 
✓ Timely follow-up with thank-you notes and receipts
 
✓ Accurate accounting and data tracking
 
✓ Evaluations and reports on various stages of the campaign
 
✓ An open letter of thanks to the community, published in the local 
papers, for support in reaching your now-successful campaign goals
Follow-up to your campaign also includes major celebrations, which should 
be part of your campaign’s overall publicity component. Have dinners to 
thank the volunteers — and invite the media. Hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony 

301
 Chapter 20: Building Buildings, Nonbuildings, and Futures: The Capital Campaign
for the new wing — and invite the media. Make a fuss over the first new teen 
mom to graduate from your job-training facility — and invite the media. After 
doing so much work quietly, the time has come for you to pat yourself on the 
back in a very public way.
Debriefing everybody
Especially with something as big and far-reaching as a capital campaign, 
learning from your successes as well as your mistakes is important. What 
went right in your capital campaign? What would you like to avoid like the 
plague in the future?
Before you disperse your committees, ask them to meet one last time for 
a debriefing. Prepare a questionnaire related to the individual tasks you 
assigned. Ask people to rate their own effectiveness as a team and to list any 
suggestions they would make for the next team who steps into their shoes. 
Ask them about their likes and dislikes about the process, and glean any 
important insights for the next capital campaign team that comes along.
Finally, summarize all the information you gather (and archive it for 
the future) before closing the book on the capital campaign altogether. 
Remember that the effects of your work, resulting in long-term pledges that 
will pay over a number of years, will be felt for many months to come. The 
knowledge that you gained from your campaign experience can help others 
begin where you left off and can take your organization into the future.

▶ Matching the donor’s cause to your mission as you develop your major gift strategy
▶ Taking advantage of planned gifts and knowing how to get them
▶ Understanding the ins and outs of challenge grants
P
icture this: You’re sitting on Mrs. Lewis’s divan. Your mouth is dry. 
You’ve been preparing for this moment for months. You’ve had several 
lunches and follow-up conversations with Mrs. Lewis, and you’ve exchanged 
personal correspondence repeatedly. You know her dog on a first-name 
basis. From your relationship to date, you expect Mrs. Lewis to be a major 
giver in one way or another. Now’s the time to see how substantial her sup-
port will be.
In this chapter, we explain the important role of the big-time giver in your 
organization, whether that person (or in some cases, that corporation or foun-
dation) presents you with a huge check as a major gift or offers to match other 
donors’ contributions with a challenge grant. We also explain how to deal with 
planned giving, a scenario in which an individual provides for your organiza-
tion in his or her will or through other kinds of planned gifts. Not everyone 
has the means to give that $5,000, $20,000, or $100,000 gift, but those people 
who do — and who have an interest and a heart for your mission — can help 
you greatly through one of these three giving opportunities.
Note: In this chapter, we provide a basic introduction to the major gift and 
planned gift concepts. We encourage you to talk to planned gift specialists for 
particulars on how to develop a planned-giving program that’s right for your 
organization.

304
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Making a Perfect Match
Making sure your organization’s mission and the interests of the donor are 
compatible is the most important part of securing a major gift. Yes, the 
giver’s ability to give is important, but even more important is the giver’s 
interest in giving specifically to your organization because of the work you 
do. Chances are a major donor gives to many different organizations, but she 
likely makes a major gift to only a select few. For this reason, making sure 
you have the right match for your donor’s interest is very important. Don’t 
panic; we explain how to do so in the following sections.
Deciding on the major gift amounts 
for your organization
What exactly is a major gift? Well, the word major here is relative. To a small 
organization, it may be $5,000. To a university, it may be $5,000,000. To a tiny, 
shoestring agency, a major gift may simply be a gift that’s bigger than the 
norm.
Consider what your organization considers a major gift. Take a look at your 
overall operating budget and ask yourself: What type of gift would be a major 
help to us? Five percent of the operating budget? Ten? Two?
As you decide on the level of major gifts for your organization, ask yourself 
the following questions (for guidance in answering these questions, head to 
Part II):
 
✓ Who are our major givers likely to be?
 
✓ What people on our board and on staff will work on building relation-
ships with our major givers?
 
✓ Do we have any current givers whom we can cultivate into major givers? 
If so, who are they?
 
✓ Does our board have expertise in the area of major gifts? Do we need to 
have board training on how to ask for major gifts?
 
✓ Is our board currently giving at a major gift level? If not, why not? If so, 
who are our highest givers?
 
✓ How do we recognize our major givers?
 
Deciding the amount that represents a major gift for your organization can not 
only help you plan to solicit for that amount but also keep you from settling 
for a $2,000 gift when you really need to move your givers toward $5,000. So 
make sure you take some time to carefully consider the questions posed in 
this section.

305
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
 
A major gift for your capital campaign is different from a major gift for your 
annual operating campaign. In a capital campaign, you strategize with big gifts 
at the top — in that kind of campaign, $1,000,000 is definitely a major gift, but 
$10,000 might not be. In your annual operating campaign, $10,000 could be 
considered a significant major gift. See Chapter 20 for more information about 
capital campaigns and Chapter 18 for more about annual campaigns.
Getting to the heart of the major giver
The most important concept to remember about potential major givers is that 
you build your relationships with them by working with them over time — 
sometimes over many years. More specifically, you and your organization 
establish a relationship with a particular major giver by following these steps:
 
1. Identify the person as a prospective major donor.
 
2. Qualify the donor by determining her interest in your organization 
and her ability to give.
 
3. Cultivate the donor and bring her ever closer to the heart of your mis-
sion. Introduce her to volunteer leadership to help build her relation-
ship with your organization.
 
4. Ask, listen, and respond to her needs.
 
5. Request the major gift.
What is a gift?
In daily life, you most likely give and receive 
gifts all the time. You give someone else your 
attention. You receive ideas from other mem-
bers on your fundraising team. You accept your 
Aunt Mildred’s parakeet gracefully because it’s 
her gift to you. But what makes a gift a gift?
In its most basic form, a gift is something you 
offer to somebody else with no thought of com-
pensation. In fundraising, a gift may mean any 
number of things that all build on this basic defi-
nition. For example:
 ✓ A general gift is one a donor gives to your 
annual fund or contributes to your organi-
zation’s operating expenses. Find out more 
about this type of gift in Chapter 18.
 ✓ A lead gift is the first, usually sizeable, gift 
to a capital campaign. Check out Chapter 20 
for more details about capital campaigns.
 ✓ A major gift is another type of large gift 
that a donor may give to support a particu-
lar program, launch a campaign, further 
a cause, or be applied in another specific 
area of service. Major gifts are the subject 
of this chapter.
Despite the many types of gifts, a gift is still just 
a gift, freely given, with no arm-twisting and no 
product or service given in return.

306
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
6. Acknowledge the gift, and continue the relationship by letting her 
know how her gift is making a difference to the people you serve.
 
7. Find a way to involve her further in specific activities.
 
Although you don’t want to insult somebody by asking for an outrageous 
amount of money, donors are often flattered that fundraisers think they’re 
capable of giving at such high amounts. Asking for more than you expect gives 
you another benefit, too — the opportunity to accept less. Being able and 
willing to accept less than you ask for initially lets the donor know it’s okay to 
“bargain down” to an amount she’s more comfortable with.
The following sections take a closer look at two specific major givers: major 
donors who give to capital campaigns and major donors who give through 
corporations. To find out more about the major giver, in general — who she 
is, what she wants, and how you can make sure the donor-agency relation-
ship with her is a positive one — turn to Chapter 9.
The give-and-take in a major campaign
A major giver in a capital campaign gives a lead gift that can make a huge 
difference in the success of your fundraising effort. A major gift in your capi-
tal campaign — also called a lead gift — may be as substantial as $25,000, 
$50,000, $100,000, or more. When you ask for lead gifts in a major campaign, 
remember that you’re looking for a few gifts that comprise 40 to 60 percent 
of your total goal. (Check out Chapter 20 for many more details about capital 
campaigns.)
 
The people who are regular and large donors to your annual fund are the best 
candidates for major, lead, and challenge gifts because they have a relation-
ship with your organization and have demonstrated their commitment to your 
cause.
Be prepared for your major giver to want to contact a tax advisor or lawyer 
before agreeing to a pledge amount. In fact, if the giver doesn’t suggest doing 
so, you should, as a donor service. Some major givers may want to draft con-
tracts to stipulate certain aspects of their agreements with you. Work with 
your organization’s legal team and your donor’s tax advisors to come to an 
agreement that’s in everybody’s best interest.
Corporate giving and cause-related major gifts
Although corporations are still a source of some major gifts, they’re increas-
ingly leaning toward giving gifts whose purposes and any publicity associ-
ated with them align with the missions of the corporations themselves. This 
relationship between the corporation and the gift is called cause-related mar-
keting. For example, a waterworks company may want to sponsor the water 
tanks at the aquarium at the zoo; in return for the company’s gift, it may want 

307
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
to attach the company name to the tanks in some way. This public recogni-
tion not only builds the company’s community-spirited image, but also pro-
vides lots of exposure as the zoo’s crowds stroll by.
Another example of cause-related marketing is when companies that depend 
on research endow chairs in the subject matters they care about in well-known 
universities. Cause-related giving is happening more and more between for-
profit and nonprofit organizations. Alliances, partnerships, and sponsorships 
between the two types of organizations are here to stay. Chapter 22 has more 
information on corporate giving and cause-related marketing.
Valuing the relationship: 
Stewardship in action
What kind of reporting method do you plan to use to let your major givers 
know that their donations are going where you said they’d go? Each indi-
vidual major gift is a campaign in itself — which means that each individual 
giver deserves to be met with, listened to, and valued. After you receive a 
major gift, nothing about the effort you put into building a relationship with 
the donor changes. In fact, it’s more important than ever to include every 
major donor in the loop.
When your major giver made her donation to you, she became a part of your 
organization. Thus, you need to include her in your organization’s communi-
cation flow when you have both good and bad news to report. Keeping your 
major donors updated on the changes — positive or negative — that are 
taking place in your organization helps the donors know that your organiza-
tion is about more than money; not to mention it makes them glad they gave 
to your organization as generously as they did.
You can report the use of donated funds through your annual report, which 
includes financial information about your organization as well as updates on 
programs, services, and staff. But for high-level, major givers, personalized 
letters with specific information about how your organization has applied 
their gifts are a great idea. For example, in your letter, you can write, “Your 
generous donation helped us provide training for 15 more teen moms than 
we helped last year.” Or you can write, “Because of you, Sarah was able to 
finish high school, take a computer course, and get an entry-level job at a 
small publishing company. Her daughter, Haley, is healthy, caught up on her 
shots, and happy in our day-care center while her mom works.”
Personalized attention makes your major givers glad they’re in a relationship 
with you. Plus, as you honor the continuing relationship between you and 
your major donors, you keep the door open for potential planned gifts in the 
future.

Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Creating a major gift strategy
Before you begin your search for major givers, take time to develop a major 
gift strategy that can help you find, cultivate, and build relationships with your 
major donors. As you craft your strategy, think about what your major givers 
are looking for in any organization to which they decide to give. For starters, 
major donors want to know that your organization does the following:
 
✓ Cares about the issues they care about
 
✓ Is careful about spending contributions
 
✓ Values them as individuals
 
✓ Appreciates their gifts
 
✓ Practices good management
 
✓ Produces measurable results
 
✓ Plans intelligently
 
✓ Selects good people who represent it well
 
✓ Presents an image with which they want to align
 
Set the ground rules for major gifts before you need them. Come up with 
naming opportunities and other forms of donor recognition. Preparing ahead 
of time and knowing what you want makes you more able to attain it.
Get your board together and follow these tips to develop your major gift 
strategy:
 
✓ Brainstorm a list of major giving ideas.
 
✓ Get board approval before you proceed.
 
✓ Create ideas you can live with for quite some time — you can’t remove a 
donor’s name from a named gift at the drop of a hat.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to reach for some high-level gifts — but also be realistic, 
based on your current economic climate.
 
✓ Consider whether corporate sponsorships or in-kind contributions can 
be a part of your major gift strategy.
 
As you put together your major gift strategy, think about how to reward your 
donors when they enter into this high-level relationship with your organiza-
tion. Some of the ideas you can include in your strategy are:
 
✓ Keep in touch with your high-level donors often. Send them newslet-
ters. Contact them by e-mail every so often. Call when you feel direct, 
personal contact is appropriate. Ask your donors what their opinions 
are about new initiatives. Follow up in other ways, too.

309
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
 
✓ Recognize your high-level donors’ gifts. Host a special dinner for your 
high-level donors. Take each major donor out to lunch. Invite your major 
donors to be part of an elite giving club.
 
✓ Visit your high-level donors at home if they enjoy personal calls. 
Personal visits build relationships in unique ways — being in someone’s 
house creates a level of intimacy that you can’t reach in a board room or 
via e-mail.
 
✓ Consider unique naming opportunities. Create a complete list of items 
that are available for naming, and keep careful track of which donors are 
offered and which ones accept these naming opportunities. Make sure 
two different staff or board members don’t promise the same naming 
item to two different donors.
 
 Naming opportunities work best when you plan them carefully and use 
them slowly. Doing so helps preserve the importance of the naming 
items and keeps you from making potentially embarrassing mistakes.
 
If you use naming opportunities, decide with your board in advance how 
much must be donated in return for the naming. Is it $40,000 for a garden, 
$20,000 for a fountain, and $10,000 for a bench? Make sure the naming items 
are planned, approved, and available before you begin publicizing your major 
gift plan.
Preparing for Planned Gifts
At the very top of the fundraising ladder, you find the planned gift. A planned 
gift is a long-term, high-dollar gift that may come to your organization in the 
form of a bequest, property, insurance, or one of several other planned-giving 
instruments (see the “Creating a plan for planned gifts and choosing gifts for 
the plan” section for more on these different instruments).
Some fundraisers build entire careers around the concept of planned giving, 
as well they should. This highly specialized area of giving requires continual 
education on current tax laws, financial instruments, best practices, and the 
application and development of gift strategies.
Changes in the economy have an impact on planned giving, but as the popu-
lation ages, your donors know that estate planning gives them a way to plan 
for the legacy they want to leave. Because of the huge transfer of wealth that 
scholars expect to take place over the next two decades and the aging baby-
boomer population, smart ways to preserve and hand down assets are in 
demand. Planned-giving instruments give donors ways to protect their hold-
ings, provide for their families, and leave a legacy to an organization with a 
mission they believe in.

310
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Getting the gift that keeps on giving
A planned gift can be a great thing both for your organization and for your 
donor’s family — it’s the gift that truly keeps on giving after your donor has 
passed away. Planned gifts range from a simple bequest to a complex trust. 
As you may expect, this kind of high-level gift comes from a much smaller 
percentage of your complete donor list than other types of gifts. However, 
don’t eliminate people who don’t seem to be potential big givers because you 
may be surprised to find out which of your donors has the resources to make 
a substantial planned gift. Even a modest annual fund donor can give you a 
gift in his will or leave you proceeds from a life insurance policy.
When you first heard the term planned gift, you may have thought “That’s 
odd — aren’t all gifts planned?” In actuality, the phrase planned gift refers to 
the high level of planning required — by fundraising officers, financial advi-
sors, tax attorneys, and more — to develop just the right giving plan for a 
high-level donor who wants to leave a major gift to a charitable organization.
In addition to requiring a lot of planning, planned gifts can do the following:
 
✓ Provide estate planning for donors
 
✓ Give donors income and possible estate tax savings
 
✓ Be given during the donor’s lifetime and be relatively small
 
✓ Provide an income to the donor or to someone designated by the donor
 
✓ Improve the relationship between the donor and your organization while 
the donor is still alive
 
✓ Involve the donor’s tax and financial advisors
Now that you know what a planned gift is, you need to figure out who the 
planned giver is. A potential planned-giving donor will be
 
✓ Engaged with your organization at a high level
 
✓ Interested in making a long-term difference for the organization
 
✓ Able to make a large donation either now, by investing funds in a 
planned-giving instrument, or later, when the ability to get at the funds 
for the donor’s own use (called accessibility and liquidity) isn’t an issue
 
The most important rule to remember for any planned-giving program is that 
the needs of the donor come first. Your donors place high trust in you as you 
help them find, evaluate, and select the right planned-giving instrument for 
their needs and financial situations. Although you’re working to secure a gift 
for your organization, remember that the gift must be the right fit for both you 
and the donor, which is why each donor should have his own advisors review 
and respond to the planned-giving plan before either party signs the contract.

311
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
Differentiating planned giving 
from other types of giving
If you have a good, healthy donor program in place, in which you cultivate 
donors, bring them ever closer to the mission of your organization, and 
upgrade them to higher gifts each year, a planned-giving program is only a 
matter of education. It’s a logical next step.
The concept of planned giving is only about 40 years old. A change in the tax 
laws in the late 1960s concerning how charitable contributions are made led 
to the development of the planned-giving instruments you can use today.
As you compare planned gifts to other types of gifts, take note of the follow-
ing three primary differences:
 
✓ The type of the gift: A planned gift may be any amount of money, stock, 
insurance, property, or material goods.
 
✓ When the gift is paid: Although a planned gift is ordinarily paid to the 
organization upon the death of the donor, some planned-giving instru-
ments pay the donor and/or other selected recipients an income during 
the donor’s lifetime, as well.
 
✓ The complexity of the gift: A planned gift is a transaction that requires 
the collaboration of tax advisors, lawyers, financial advisors, and fund-
raising professionals, all working together with both the donor’s and the 
organization’s best interests in mind.
 
Your potential planned giver needs to find out over how many years he can 
allocate the deduction for his planned gift. After all, many people can’t take the 
deduction all in one year. Make sure that your donor talks to his tax profes-
sional and gets all the answers he needs before either of you sign a contract.
Timing is key: Knowing when to start
If you’ve just begun putting a fundraising system in place in your organiza-
tion, or you’re a one-person development office, you may be wondering how 
important a planned-giving program really is and when you need to start one.
One big mistake many organizations make with planned giving is not starting 
it soon enough. When you create planned-giving opportunities, you generate 
gifts that will come to you later. Prepared organizations always know who 
their top-level donors are and what kind of potential gifts are “in the pipe-
line,” which means future planned gifts as well as projected donations for 
other campaigns.

312
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
In general, you know you’re ready to start a planned-giving program when
 
✓ You have an established donor base.
 
✓ You’ve demonstrated good stewardship consistently.
 
✓ You have the resources (on your board or through a consultant) to offer 
the high-end support a planned-giving program requires.
 
Many nonprofit organizations rely on the pro bono services of tax or legal 
advisors to set up and maintain their planned-giving programs. Traditionally, 
only the larger organizations (museums, symphonies, universities, and so on) 
can afford a full-time staff member who specializes in this area. Either way, as 
a best practice, be sure to have a planned-giving professional either on your 
board or available to consult as needed.
Gearing up for planned giving
As with all other aspects of your fundraising plan, your organization’s mis-
sion is an important element of your planned-giving program. Yet, although 
we can assume that you have a crystal-clear mission and the publications 
to support it, before you embark on a program that takes you into the deep 
waters of planned giving, you need to be certain you have a sound planned-
giving plan — and the people to work it — in place.
To get a planned-giving program going, you need three things:
 
✓ A board that’s ready for planned giving
 
✓ A plan to implement a planned-giving program
 
✓ The professional resources to help you investigate, set up, and maintain 
the program
 
Not all organizations are set up the same way, but some boards organize a 
planned-giving committee to make important decisions like what the responsi-
bilities of the committee members will be, how planned funds will be invested, 
what the board’s legal responsibilities are, and how the invested funds will be 
used. Whether or not you have a planned-giving committee, you need a pro-
cess by which the board supervises your planned-giving program.
The following sections help you gear up for your planned-giving program.
Starting with your board
Making sure your board is ready to implement a planned-giving program is 
an important part of putting your program in place. If your organization has a 
good reputation in the community and is led by solid, respected leaders, you 
may be ready to start a planned-giving program. As you explore this complex 
fundraising option, do the following:

313
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
 
✓ Open the topic for discussion with your board, and ask a local financial 
expert (if you don’t have one on your board) to explain the various 
planned-giving instruments and their individual features.
 
✓ Pull together a focus group to discuss the pros and cons of a planned-
giving program in your organization.
 
 You may also want to do an informal survey among some of your closest 
donors that says, “We’re thinking about starting a planned-giving pro-
gram for the people closest to our mission. Do you think people would 
be interested in a program that . . . ?”
 
Because planned giving is such a highly specialized area, nonprofit organiza-
tions considering a planned-giving program for the first time need to get edu-
cated about the process before they begin. Look for classes in your area that 
offer the basics of planned giving; for example, a financial services firm in your 
area may offer classes on planned-giving instruments.
 
Regularly advising your board of all planned gifts you’re exploring is extremely 
important. Some gifts may involve obligations on the part of the organization, 
and, for this reason, the board needs to be involved.
Creating a plan for planned gifts and choosing gifts for the plan
The largest part of preparing for a planned-giving program is determining 
your goals and guidelines for the solicitation, acceptance, and administration 
of gifts. Don’t forget to get legal and financial advice as you prepare these 
guidelines.
After you get some input from legal and financial professionals, your planned-
giving committee (if you have one) or your board needs to draft policies that 
determine the following:
 
✓ The type of gifts you offer
 
✓ The amount the planned gift pays to donors (if applicable)
 
✓ The legal and ethical responsibilities of you, the fundraiser
 
✓ The process you follow to preserve the confidentiality of the donor
 
✓ The distribution of assets
 
✓ The investments you accept
In planned giving, you can use a number of different donation instruments — 
which is one of the reasons why having a well-trained, knowledgeable, and 
up-to-date consultant or staff member is vitally important. The person who 
works with donors on planned-giving possibilities needs to be able to answer 
questions about the various instruments, use his resources to find the solu-
tions to complex situations, and make recommendations in the best interests 
of the donor.

314
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Some of the more popular planned-giving instruments your organization will 
work with as you explore planned giving as a fundraising option include wills, 
charitable gift annuities, charitable trusts, insurance and interest gifts, and 
qualified plans.
Here’s a rundown on each of these different gift types:
 
✓ Working with wills: A will is the simplest and most common planned-
giving instrument. Because most people are familiar with wills, this 
instrument is the easiest one to explain and market. When donors 
work with your organization to draft their wills, they can protect their 
dependents, reduce their estate taxes, and control how their assets are 
distributed — and to whom. Some donors like leaving contributions 
to charities in their wills because the gift is revocable — if the donor 
changes his mind later, he can revise his will and erase the gift. In 
other gift forms based on contractual agreements, donors can’t change 
their minds.
 
✓ Assessing annuities: In a charitable gift annuity, the donor makes a gift 
of cash or assets to your organization and your organization agrees to 
pay an income to the donor and/or his beneficiaries until the donor’s 
death. The older the donor is, the higher the annual income you pay. 
Marketing tips for planned giving
Part of getting your planned-giving program 
going is letting financial and legal professionals 
who advise their clients about such programs 
know about it. How exactly does speaking 
to these professionals help your program? 
Education is the key. If tax advisors, lawyers, 
and financial experts in your area know about 
your planned-giving program, they can recom-
mend it to their clients, saying, “You’re in an 
estate tax rate category in which you can des-
ignate the money for a charity you care about; 
otherwise, that same money will be paid to the 
state and federal government for estate and 
inheritance taxes.” Who wants to pay money 
to the state when they could leave behind a 
legacy with an organization they care about?
Here are a couple of ideas for effectively mar-
keting your program to professionals:
 ✓ Get out in the community and make presen-
tations. Go to lawyers’ and accountants’ 
offices — two groups who will be inter-
ested in what you’re offering their clients — 
and explain your planned-giving program 
and the instruments you offer.
 ✓ If you live in a small- to medium-sized town, 
go to your local banker and ask, “Who are 
the local lawyers in town who deal with 
most of the big gifts?” Follow those leads to 
have discussions with the attorneys in town 
who deal most often with planned giving.

315
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
Your organization invests the donated funds and pays out a fixed income 
to the donor. The benefits to the donor include receipt of partially tax-
free income capital, as well as estate tax benefits. The American Council 
on Gift Annuities (ACGA), a national organization of charities founded as 
the Committee on Gift Annuities, educates charities about gift annuities 
and other planned gifts. You can find suggested charitable gift annuity 
rates by going to the organization’s Web site at www.acga-web.org/
giftrates.html. Most charities rely on the ACGA to help them deter-
mine the payout rate for charitable gift annuities.
 
✓ Tackling charitable trusts: The charitable remainder trust is a three-way 
relationship arranged between a charity and a donor through a trustee, 
who manages the account. Using this type of giving instrument, the 
donor sets up a trust for the donation, using annual payments, which 
pays out to the charity upon his death. This type of trust benefits the 
donor by reducing the donor’s estate tax and providing income and 
capital gains’ tax benefits. A charitable lead trust is slightly different from 
a charitable remainder trust in that the donor specifies a certain number 
of years during which an annual payment is made to the charity. At the 
end of that specified time, the principal is returned to the donor or paid 
to a designated beneficiary. Both charitable remainder and charitable 
lead trusts can be either the unitrust type, which provides fluctuating 
income based on the value of the trusts’ assets, or the annuity type, 
which provides fixed income.
 
✓ Investigating insurance and interest gifts: Donors can also give an 
organization an individual insurance policy. The charity collects the 
insurance proceeds upon the death of the donor. If the premiums 
are continuing, the organization typically pays the premiums and the 
donor sends in an annual contribution to provide for these payments. 
Insurance policies are fairly common planned-giving instruments. In 
some cases, you can use a two-fold system: A charitable remainder trust 
purchases an insurance policy on the person who donated the money 
in the first place. The charity gets the money in the trust, and the insur-
ance proceeds go to a designated heir selected by the donor.
 
✓ Using qualified plans: Qualified plans include IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 
a variety of other investment plans. Simply by changing the named benefi-
ciary on the plan, an individual donor can designate all or part of the pro-
ceeds of a qualified plan to a charity. Upon the donor’s death, the amount 
contributed to the charity isn’t included in the individual’s estate.
 
State regulations on annuities and trusts vary, so check the regulations in your 
area before beginning such programs. You can get a listing of state regulations 
by going to the Planned Giving Resources site at www.pgresources.com/
regs.html.

316
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Marketing the plan to the giving public
When you announce to your organization’s donors, “We now have a planned-
giving program,” your next task is to educate your donors about what that 
program involves, how it benefits them, and how they can best take advan-
tage of it. As you look for ways to educate your donors about your planned-
giving program, try doing the following:
 
✓ Mention your program in your newsletter and on your Web site.
 
✓ Send a flyer to prequalified donors in a targeted mail campaign.
 
✓ Write personal letters to individual donors.
 
✓ Create a new planned-giving brochure.
 
✓ Send an e-mail message to online donors.
 
✓ Advertise in publications with your audience base.
 
✓ Announce your program at a donor recognition luncheon.
 
One key to launching a successful planned-giving program is making sure you 
publicize it to the right audience. If you approach a mid-20s audience with a 
planned-giving strategy, they’re likely to say, “Great. Let me get back to you 
in another 20 years.” If you introduce your program to a select group of high-
level givers who are also retirees, sooner or later they’re going to come to you 
and say, “I’m putting together my will. . . .”
Making Money Go the Extra Mile: 
Challenge Grants
A challenge grant, one of the most effective fundraising tools around today, is 
a type of funding offered to your organization — sometimes anonymously — 
contingent on your organization’s raising a set number of matching funds. 
Web resources for planned giving
The Partnership for Philanthropic Planning, 
a professional group for charitable gift-
planning professionals, lists various position 
papers related to planned-giving instruments 
on its Web site at www.pppnet.org/

library at www.charityvillage.com.

 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
Because challenge grants force your organization to raise a set number of 
funds, all the gifts involved in a challenge grant go farther — which can mean 
happy givers and more good being accomplished by your organization.
In times of economic hardship, giving your donors the opportunity to partici-
pate in a matched-giving program (the kind of program that elicits challenge 
grants) can help them feel like they’re truly making a difference, even though 
their gifts may be smaller than they were in previous years. Additionally, a 
matched-giving program builds a community of giving that can have payoffs 
far into the future.
In Chapter 11, we explain the ins and outs of grant proposal writing. 
Challenge grants also involve grant proposals, but with a twist: In a challenge 
grant proposal, the donors of the grant spell out the terms and conditions of 
the funding. The donor states that she’ll give a substantial gift, if the giving 
public matches it. This type of grant provides a huge incentive for potential 
donors to make their dollars go much, much farther.
When you apply for a challenge grant, you say to your potential funders, 
“The program we’re trying to fund is a program that covers not only all the 
standard grant proposal ingredients but also a plan for securing matching 
funding, projected amounts, intended sources, and measurable outcomes.” In 
any challenge grant proposal, you want to communicate this message to the 
potential grantor: You have the possibility to be the whole inspiration for this 
new initiative; your challenge grant will make it happen.
Here are a few real-life examples of situations in which challenge grants made 
a big difference in a particular program:
 
✓ A donor who supports a small educational foundation pledged a $10,000 
challenge gift to other donors with the intention of matching all gifts up 
to the $10,000 amount. This inspired year-end giving to the foundation.
 
✓ United Way created the Forever Fund with the intention of providing 
an endowment for the continuance of the organization. The fundraising 
effort floundered until the Lilly Endowment came along and gave a huge 
challenge incentive.
 
✓ More than 65 community foundations in the state of Indiana have used 
challenge grants to get started. Michigan and Ohio have now started 
community foundations using the same approach.
In general, challenge grants do three positive things:
 
✓ Challenge grants spotlight your organization and provide an endorse-
ment from a major player. The person or entity giving the challenge grant 
is most likely someone in the public eye — the publicity they receive for 
their philanthropy benefits you both. For your organization, this alliance 
means respectability — the “good fundraising” seal of approval.

318
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
✓ Challenge grants help people feel that their money goes farther than 
it would in a sole donation. If a foundation gives you $10,000 to start a 
new family life program and you match it with another $10,000, all the 
donors who gave to your campaign can feel that their donation went 
twice as far. Plus, challenge grants can have different kinds of ratios — 
for example, 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1. In other words, a challenge grant funder 
can choose to match two or three times the amount your other donors 
give, depending on the program you’re funding and the relationship you 
develop with that funder.
 
✓ Challenge grants enable you to honor and reward the giver of the 
challenge grant. This person is a “mover and shaker” and probably one 
of the closest constituents you have in your organization. The recogni-
tion you give her helps her feel good about her gift and gives her the sat-
isfaction of knowing her generosity enabled the whole program to work. 
The recognition you give your challenge grant funder inspires others to 
want to make challenge grants in the future, as well.
The following sections cover some basic info you need to know as you 
explore the idea of starting your own matched-giving program.
 
Before you open up to the possibility of challenge grants, discuss the idea 
with your board. Feel out any resistance. Most likely, your board will approve 
the idea and want to participate. Often the first challenge gifts you receive are 
from board members themselves.
Understanding how challenge grants work
Both corporations and foundations typically play major roles in giving chal-
lenge grants, because doing so leverages their money. Their initial invest-
ments may be doubled, tripled, quadrupled, or more. One recent challenge 
grant began with a $5 million grant and raised more than $40 million. The 
corporation got publicity and credit for initiating a $40 million contribution — 
now that’s potent stuff.
But not all your challenge grants will be multimillion-dollar affairs. In many 
fundraising drives hosted by churches or service organizations associated 
with the arts, social services, and education, the main benefit of challenge 
grants isn’t that they raise millions of dollars, but, instead, that they take the 
money farther than the original gift. In each of these service areas, the grants 
are usually related to something new or to the enlargement of an existing 
program.

319
 Chapter 21: Securing Major Gifts, Planned Gifts, and the Challenge Grant
Live events, such as public radio fundraisers, often accept challenge grants 
of as little as $1,000 that must be met in the next hour from listeners. If you 
have access to such media, look for mini-challenge, short-time-period grant 
opportunities.
 
As you look for ways to get a challenge grant going, keep the plans quiet. Top-
level donors will be interested in getting in on the front end of a big deal — 
advertising your intent may diffuse the excitement. Work out all your plans 
before you approach the selected donor with the idea. Then, when you’re 
ready, say to the donor, “We’re designing this program and we think you’d be 
perfect to lead the campaign with a challenge grant of $5,000.”
Managing a challenge grant
As you design the proposal for your challenge grant, keep the following key 
concept in mind: You’re giving this person (or funder) the ability to empower 
lots of other people to give. This powerful thought is the major difference 
between a traditional grant proposal and a challenge grant proposal.
When you begin your challenge grant campaign, you want your potential 
matching donors to recognize the opportunity to increase the effectiveness 
of their gift. You also want them to think, “Gosh, we’d better be part of this 
campaign — we certainly don’t want to be left out!”
 
If you’re leveraging a challenge grant to secure funding from another source, 
be prepared to provide proof of the challenge. A letter from the funding indi-
vidual or entity, signed by the appropriate responsible parties, should suffice.
Generally, challenge grant funders don’t specify how the remaining money 
must come in — the idea is to get the amount matched.
Challenge grants nearly always have deadlines, which are both practical and 
helpful — deadlines give you specific time frames for your campaigns. Having 
a specified time frame in which to raise the matching money enables you to 
put some urgency into your fundraising letters. For example, you can write, 
“If we don’t raise the matching amount by December 31, 2011, we lose half of 
the challenge grant.” Your potential donors won’t miss that kind of urgency.
After you receive a challenge grant, the best way to motivate other people to 
give is by securing great gifts from people and groups that donors admire — 
with the promise that donors can extend the reach of their gifts by contribut-
ing now.

Chapter 22
Engaging the Corporate Giver
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why corporations give
▶ Locating the right corporate donor match for your organization
▶ Convincing corporate donors to give to your cause
N
ot all major givers are individual philanthropists interested in further-
ing your mission and earning tax benefits and other perks at the same 
time — corporations are a source of major giving on an international scale. 
Whether they give from their corporate foundations or through corporate 
sponsorships, corporations generally want more than a simple feel-good feel-
ing for their donations. They want to see measurable benefits for their com-
panies, which is why corporations carefully evaluate the causes they support 
and the missions they engage in, especially in times of economic challenge.
Philanthropy is good business, and supporting charitable efforts enables 
companies to differentiate themselves from their competition. Favorable 
public opinion is a sought-after goal in both the for-profit and nonprofit sec-
tors. Aligning with a good cause helps build the community feel-good quo-
tient and benefits the company by boosting goodwill, perhaps increasing 
sales, raising visibility, and creating a sense of benevolence and involvement 
that may help it attract and keep good employees.
This chapter shows you how to go about finding the right corporations to 
approach on behalf of your cause. Then it offers you some pointers about 
pitching your message to a company’s decision makers.
Understanding the Attitudes 
behind Corporate Giving
You can’t really know how to approach donors until you understand the 
reasons why they give. Individuals may have hundreds of reasons for giving. 
Corporations can be a little more straightforward: a blending of practical and 
altruistic reasoning.

Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Many corporations donate in the interests of cause-related marketing, a way 
to associate themselves with the good guys of charity to spiff up their own 
public images. They get free publicity and free goodwill. People may buy 
more of the corporation’s products than their competitors’ when they hear 
of their good deeds. Some corporations even find that giving is a way to influ-
ence politicians regarding legislation related to their industries.
But many corporations give above and beyond the basic promotional possi-
bilities, and different companies give for different reasons. Some may indeed 
have altruistic motives as well as the desire to give back to the community. In 
addition to self-promotion, corporations give major gifts because they want
 
✓ To show the community that they are people friendly (or arts friendly, 
or health conscious, whatever the case may be)
 
✓ To show their employees that they care about improving their community
 
✓ To help organizations that do work related to their particular industry 
(for example, a medical supply company that makes a major gift to a 
medical school)
 
✓ To give a seal of approval to a particular cause
Some corporations go even further in their commitment to doing good. They 
may develop a philanthropic plan or use cause-related marketing. We explain 
these concepts in more detail in the following sections.
Making a difference in the community
A quick review of most corporate mission statements shows you that busi-
nesses today are more aware of the community impact their products and 
services need to have. Corporate mission statements don’t say “our goal is 
to make money;” instead, they may say “our goal is to provide reasonably 
priced ways to improve life for families affected by. . . .” This focus is more in 
tune with benefits to both the individual and the community. By understand-
ing a particular corporation’s approach, you can see how your cause may 
align with that company’s giving program.
Some corporations today are developing philanthropic giving strategies that 
become part of the overall strategic plan of the business. A philanthropic giving 
plan is filled out and approved by a committee of the board and includes the 
corporation’s giving mission statement, which states the corporation’s belief in 
philanthropy and the way in which that belief aligns with the company’s mis-
sion. The plan may spell out different strategies for specific initiatives — for 
example, providing different amounts to education, social services, and the arts.
The best giving programs relate their missions not only to the community 
but to their workforces, as well, and they try to engage employees in the 
giving process. These corporations are likely to encourage their employees

 Chapter 22: Engaging the Corporate Giver
to donate volunteer time to a nonprofit organization, and the volunteers are 
recognized for the hours donated and time worked. Some companies even 
have celebrations to reward employees who dedicate considerable effort to 
nonprofit organizations — this is a great way to encourage a culture of giving 
and boost the morale of your workforce at the same time.
 
The best place to start in researching corporate philanthropy plans is on com-
pany Web sites. Organizations that have a philanthropic arm promote their 
philanthropy through traditional marketing channels and include information 
about granting programs on their sites and perhaps through social media.
You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours: 
Cause-related marketing
Cause-related marketing is a popular approach for corporations in which the 
business provides needed equipment or services for the nonprofit, and the 
nonprofit provides visibility in the community for the business by advertis-
ing the help it received. The business benefits from the “good guy” image it 
develops as a result of the positive publicity, and the organization benefits 
from the exposure and the share of the proceeds it receives from the busi-
ness. For example, a computer company forms a link with an organization 
that works with kids with disabilities, or a local business may make itself a 
visible patron to a particular theater or musical organization.
 
If your mission has national or international appeal, you aren’t limited to 
forming links with only corporations in your local area. As you look for cor-
porations that may be interested in developing their cause-related marketing 
approaches with your organization, continue your research on a larger scale. 
Start with the top corporate givers featured in the most recent edition of the 
publication Giving USA (www.givingusa.org). Work through the list to find 
out which corporate-giving programs fund the type of programs you offer.
 
Additionally, keep on top of who’s who at various corporations, and keep your 
thumb on the pulse of the giving market. The following publications can pro-
vide a resource for your corporate fact-finding initiative:

Note that some of these publications carry a big price tag, sometimes $600 or 
more. To keep your costs down, consider buying a used copy, but don’t skimp 
and buy an older edition. Always buy the most current edition: the up-to-date 
information is well worth the price.
Most big corporations publish a brochure about their corporate-giving 
programs. Sometimes the programs are specialized and very focused, and 
sometimes the programs are general and support a wide range of causes. 
After you identify a corporation that may be aligned with your cause, call 
the company and ask whether they have a brochure that can provide you 
with more details about their giving strategies.
Finding the Right Corporations 
for Your Organization
Finding the right corporation is like finding the right mate. Not every corpora-
tion fits with your organization and its cause. You have to find a corporation 
that matches your organization in interests, priorities, and self-interest.
Finding the right corporation with a heart for philanthropy takes a little leg-
work, but with enough effort, you can find the perfect company for your organi-
zation. For this matchmaking effort, put on your business hat. Remember that 
with a corporation (as with every donor, but even more so with a corporation), 
Different ways that corporations give
A giant multifigure check may be the donation 
you’d be happiest to see, but, in fact, corpora-
tions give in a variety of ways, including the 
following:
 ✓ Giving the ever-popular donation
 ✓ Hosting days of giving in which the compa-
nies give their employees the whole day off 
to volunteer (The tendency now is to align 
the volunteer project with what the busi-
ness does. For example, computer compa-
nies give computers to poor kids.)
 ✓ Offering matching gifts, in which the corpo-
ration matches a gift made by an employee
 ✓ Encouraging volunteerism
 ✓ Donating equipment
 ✓ Providing in-kind or pro bono services
 ✓ Donating space, such as office or ware-
house space
 ✓ Creating partnerships in the form of cause-
related marketing or sponsorships for 
programs
 ✓ Sponsoring foundation gifts

325
 Chapter 22: Engaging the Corporate Giver
giving is an exchange — something for something. Corporations want to get 
something out of the relationship, so consider what you have to offer and who 
may want to “buy” what you have.
Using the local community hook
Which corporations give in your community? When you start looking for 
their names, you’ll see them everywhere: on theater programs, in the local 
newspaper, at the park, and in the schools. Keep a notebook with you so you 
can jot down names of local businesses that support nonprofits with mis-
sions in your area of service. You’ll be glad you did when you begin building 
the part of your fundraising program that targets corporate giving.
Here are a few questions you can ask yourself and your corporate-giving 
team as you think about how and whom to approach for corporate giving:
 
✓ Which corporations give to your organization now?
 
✓ Which corporations in your location may have a link to your mission?
 
✓ Which corporations give to organizations that are similar to yours?
 
✓ Which of your board members, if any, have direct links to corporations?
 
✓ Whom do you know at any of the potential donor corporations?
 
✓ Which local corporations can you invite to participate on your board?
 
✓ Which corporations may benefit from the positive publicity of being 
involved with your mission?
If you don’t have any strong, peer-to-peer links to people at local corpora-
tions, subscribe to your local business journal or get a copy of the member 
lists published by your local chamber of commerce. These member lists 
include all kinds of companies, including major electrical contractors, banks, 
real estate companies, and insurance businesses, that you can approach as 
you try to develop corporate-donor relationships.
 
If you have corporations represented on your board, you may already be 
receiving corporate gifts. As you start your planning for a corporate fundraising 
strategy, put together a focus group of these corporate representatives, and ask 
them what they’d most like to see in a presentation about your organization. 
Don’t forget to ask each member of your focus group for the names of three 
people you can contact as you begin your corporate fundraising campaign.
 
Local corporations can be the best source for in-kind donations. For example, 
a national supermarket chain with a branch in your town may be willing to 
donate food for a fundraising event. Your best contact for such local in-kind 
donations is probably the manager of the local branch store or office, who has 
some latitude to donate to local groups.

326
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
Discovering where the CEO’s heart lies
Often a company gives because the person in charge has a certain interest. 
For example, if the head of the local bank is an opera nut, you may find a 
sympathetic ear for your community operetta group. If you can connect with 
the CEO and have him or her turn you over to the person at the company 
who heads up corporate giving, you have a good shot at getting some kind of 
gift. After all, it’s a brave corporate-giving manager who disregards the CEO’s 
recommendation.
 
Because identifying with the head of a company is often the key to getting 
donations from that company, make sure you do your research before you set 
up a meeting with a particular CEO so you know what the CEO is interested in 
and what he or she may be interested in funding.
Suppose you’ve managed to get a meeting with the new CEO of Acme Paper 
Company — Mrs. Anderson. You go to the company’s main office nervous 
about meeting with such a powerful person but confident about your cause. 
You’ve done your homework and know that the company Mrs. Anderson 
used to head up was a big giver in the healthcare sector, but now that she’s 
with Acme Paper, you hope she’ll follow its tradition of supporting animal 
rights causes.
As you’re ushered into Mrs. Anderson’s office, you’re relieved to see pictures 
of dogs everywhere . . . until you find out that those pictures belonged to the 
outgoing CEO and that Mrs. Anderson is allergic to dogs. Don’t worry — you 
can still recover. Keep your sense of humor intact, and use your assumption to 
find out what Mrs. Anderson really does care about; then use that information 
to show her why your organization’s mission fits the causes she cares about.
 
Watch the social pages of your local newspaper to see whether the CEOs of any 
local companies are showing up at theater openings, hospital fundraisers, or 
local horse shows. If you’re an arts group, an organization that helps pregnant 
women get healthcare, or an animal rights activist, you may just find the hook 
that will get your foot in the CEO’s door. (After all, just because Mrs. Anderson 
is allergic to dogs doesn’t mean she doesn’t have half a dozen cats at home!)
Finding out what serves 
the company’s interests
With a little strategizing, you can fairly easily figure out the types of connec-
tions between businesses and causes that make sense for corporate giving. 
Here are just a few examples of such logical connections:

327
 Chapter 22: Engaging the Corporate Giver
 
✓ A pharmaceutical company gives money to fund a new community 
clinic.
 
✓ A software company donates free computers to schools, loaded, of 
course, with their own software products.
 
✓ The local car dealership gives to a program to put a stop to drunk driving.
 
✓ The large smelting plant that used to have issues with polluting the air 
gives money to fund an environmental study.
Ironically, even if corporations seem to be part of the overall problem — for 
example, a liquor company donating to a campaign against drinking and 
driving — they can claim that they’re the good guys if their products are 
used responsibly.
After you identify companies with which your cause may have a logical con-
nection, remember to listen to your own intuition. Does the connection feel 
right? Is this match a logical, natural connection? If so, you may have found a 
likely corporate donor.
Approaching a Corporate Donor
Every corporation and every industry has different concerns, but they’re all 
in the business of making money. So why do corporations give money away? 
The answer is simple — because they see some kind of profit in doing so.
In many aspects, approaching a corporate donor isn’t that different from 
approaching any donor. You determine
 
✓ What the corporation’s interest is
 
✓ What its giving track record is
 
✓ How you can help the corporation participate in an area it wants to 
make a difference in, for whatever reason
But the corporate world does have a few unique differences, which we dis-
cuss in the sections that follow.
Researching the corporation ahead of time
The first step to finding the right corporations for your organization’s 
corporate campaign is knowing which kind of entities you’re approaching. 
Corporate giving usually comes from one of the following two sources (take 
note of the differences between them):

328
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
✓ Company-sponsored foundations: These foundations are separate enti-
ties under the law from the corporation they’re linked to. Their giving 
typically is allied with the corporation’s interests. The parent company 
contributes to the foundation on a regular basis. Their endowments may 
grow when the corporation is profitable and shrink when it isn’t so prof-
itable. Federal and state regulations for private foundations govern com-
pany-sponsored foundations. Just like other foundations you work with, 
company-sponsored foundations award funds in the form of grants.
 
✓ Corporate direct-giving programs: These programs are part of the cor-
poration itself and, as such, don’t have to meet regulations for private 
foundations. In this setup, the company typically can use up to 10 per-
cent of its pretax money to make contributions to charity, though most 
companies give more like 1 percent on average. These programs have no 
endowment per se but work off company profits. Often companies have 
direct-giving programs in which the corporation matches gifts to nonprof-
its made by employees and directors, and the matches may be a variety 
of multiples, for example, 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1. Many corporations also set up in-
kind gift programs in which they donate time and materials to nonprofits.
 
 If you set up a matching-gift program with a corporate donor, be sure to 
get your thank-yous right. In some cases, development directors overlook 
matching gifts because they fail to recognize the original gifts that made the 
larger amount possible. For best practices — and the happiest donors — 
send thank-you notes that appropriately reflect the good that came from 
the gift as a whole to everyone who contributed to the matching gift.
To find out if a corporation has a foundation, go to a foundation directory, 
such as the Foundation Directory Online (www.fconline.foundation
center.org) or the Foundation Finder at The Foundation Center’s Web site 
(www.foundationcenter.org), and search for the corporation’s name. To 
determine whether a corporation has a direct-giving program, go to the com-
pany Web site and search for direct-giving programs.
 
The Foundation Center offers a subscription-based corporate-giving directory 
that includes current information on corporate philanthropy programs. Go to 
foundationcenter.org/findfunders/fundingsources/cgo.html to 
find out more information.
The next piece of the corporate-giving puzzle is figuring out the types of pro-
grams corporations support. This step is very similar to what you do to find 
the right foundation to support your cause. All corporations or corporate-
affiliated foundations publish information about the types of programs they 
fund. Look on their Web sites or contact them for a copy of their guidelines. 
The guidelines tell you whether the foundation leans toward the arts, health-
related causes, education, community-focused issues, or whatever. Then direct 
your efforts toward the ones that seem like a good match for your cause.

329
 Chapter 22: Engaging the Corporate Giver
 
Chapter 7 is all about researching donors, and Chapters 9 and 10 are all 
about approaching folks for major gifts. If you’re serious about looking for 
corporate donors, read those chapters along with this chapter for more 
about researching.
Knowing your value to the donor
Don’t ever forget that your organization has something to bring to the table 
in the corporate-giving exchange. For example:
 
✓ You lend an image of goodwill and credibility to the corporation.
 
✓ You offer tax advantages for corporations that donate pretax dollars.
 
✓ You provide a way for corporations to attract good employees who 
share their charitable interests.
 
✓ You help to improve the community in which the corporation exists and 
its employees live.
When you approach a member of a corporation for a major gift, you’re work-
ing with somebody who understands the value of this give-and-take relation-
ship better than most. Keep this fact in mind, and you may just feel confident 
approaching corporate givers in a businesslike way.
 
If you’re having trouble finding the right initial contact at a company, try 
searching the company’s Web site for the corporate affairs or community 
relations department. If, as far as you can tell, the company doesn’t have such 
departments, start with public relations or marketing. Consider asking your 
board members or major donors who have existing corporate relationships to 
make introductions for your organization.
Putting together your presentation
When you approach a corporation or company-sponsored foundation for 
funding, you have to jump through all the hoops that other kinds of donors 
put you through. As you prepare to jump through these hoops, you need to
 
✓ Research the specific guidelines the corporation publishes for submit-
ting applications.
 
✓ Meet all deadlines and include everything the guidelines require.
 
✓ Build a compelling case for your organization by including your up-to-
date case statement, your accomplishments, and your ability to govern 
your activities professionally.

330
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
Don’t forget the financials. Businesspeople are used to seeing balance sheets 
and budgets, and they expect to see that you’re a viable business with some 
business-savvy leaders in your operations. If you have strong corporate types 
on your board, stress that fact. Include their résumés, or at least a short bio-
graphical paragraph on each of them, with your application. Try to set up one-
on-one personal meetings with your key board members and the corporation 
representatives if possible.
Following up in a businesslike way
Any good businessperson will tell you that good follow-up is respected in the 
corporate world. Of course, you need to be aware of the likely time frames in 
the corporate or corporate foundation’s grant application guidelines (or the 
time frames you get from the corporation’s corporate-giving manager at your 
meeting), but if the estimated time of response has come and gone, follow 
up with a letter or phone call. You can inquire as to whether the corporation 
needs any additional information from you. This follow-up contact can lead 
to the unearthing of your application from a pile of applications and get you 
some attention ahead of less proactive applicants.
 
After you get one corporate gift, don’t stop pursuing your corporate-giving 
campaign. Continue to notice the corporations in your area that are giving to 
organizations in your particular field, be it the arts, education, health, human 
services, or civic affairs. Look for new sponsorships, and be sure to feed your 
observations back into your ever-expanding research file. One day in the not-
too-distant future, the file may lead to an exceptional major gift.
The difference between promoting and giving
True, corporations give, but some people argue 
that they do it in the name of promotion. Give 
a million, and you make the front pages of the 
papers. (Unless someone else just happened to 
give a billion that day, in which case your cor-
porate gift may be buried on page three.) Give a 
million, and your company name is aligned with 
a cause. Give a million, and you become the 
national spokesperson and corporate sponsor 
of a program to combat the societal ill you’re 
helping to fight. In this way, giving makes sense 
for corporations; not to mention, it also makes 
them money and friends.
But is it wrong?
Throughout this book, we point out that you 
can’t and shouldn’t second-guess the motives 
of your donors, assuming their intent isn’t 
illegal. If you do, you spend all your time and 
energy qualifying the reasons behind the gift 
and not acting responsibly to steward the gift. 
Corporations give, and their gifts benefit your 
organization. If their promotions are in align-
ment with your mission and you can work out 
an equitable exchange, everybody wins — 
most of all, the people you serve.

Endowments
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the nuts and bolts of endowments and choosing the right one for you
▶ Finding ways to get people excited about funding an endowment
▶ Managing an endowment after you build it
H
ave you ever read an old Victorian novel in which the hero lives off his 
trust fund or inheritance? Have you ever wondered how to create such 
a viable source of funding for your organization? An endowment is actually 
quite similar to a trust fund or inheritance: It provides a nest egg of funds, 
which, in addition to providing for the long-term needs of your organization, 
may provide some extra support for your annual fund or be used to start a 
new program.
In times of economic upheaval, however, endowments can take a big hit. The 
recession of 2007 through 2009 had its impact, and, as a result, the enthusi-
asm for endowments may be suffering a little. In the short term, the energy 
you spend building endowments may seem like an ill-advised investment, but 
over the long term, endowments rebound and provide ongoing support for 
your organization.
Endowments come in many types, and setting up and managing any of them 
require a specific set of resources. In this chapter, we help you discover 
what an endowment is, whether setting one up is right for you, and what’s 
involved in getting and keeping one.
Endowing the Future
Although one-time major gifts are important for the ongoing work of your 
organization, an endowment differs from major gifts in an important way. 
The whole idea behind an endowment is to take advantage of the profits 

332
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
a substantial amount of money can generate, without ever emptying the 
treasure chest itself. With a major gift, the substantial amount of money is 
applied to the program it was donated to fund. The endowment process 
involves lawyers, paperwork, and administration. But if you’re the right 
kind of organization, endowments can set you up for a more secure future. 
Keep reading to find out more about how endowments work and whether 
they can become another means of funding for your organization.
Understanding what an endowment is
An endowment is simply a donation of funds that brings with it a stipulation 
that it be invested. The principal stays intact, and the organization benefits 
from the proceeds of the investments. Each year your organization draws 
down a fixed percentage of the endowment, drawing part from the earnings 
and part from the appreciation. Your board sets these percentages and over-
sees the management of the endowment.
 
Best practices suggest that you have a committee or board separate from your 
organization’s board of directors run the endowment; you may also have one 
board member who serves on both boards. See the later section “Managing an 
Endowment” for more details.
Note that an endowment can consist of other assets besides money, such 
as property or securities. Trust funds, memorial trusts, and asset bases are 
other terms you may hear used for endowments.
Typically, you can have two types of endowments — restricted and unre-
stricted. Here’s how the two types differ:
 
✓ The payout from an unrestricted endowment, which comes from interest 
and appreciation, can be used in any way the organization’s board sees fit.
 
✓ Restricted endowment funds are earmarked for a particular type of spend-
ing, meaning that either the major donor stipulated how the money 
would be spent when giving the gift (this kind of gift is called donor des-
ignated) or the organization specified that the fund would be focused in 
one area when setting it up.
Note: When your organization sets up funds to function as an endowment 
(whether it’s restricted or unrestricted) instead of using donor funds to set it 
up, you have a quasi endowment.
The length of an endowment can also vary. An endowment may exist into per-
petuity or have a fixed term. Here’s how these lengths differ:

333
 Chapter 23: Building and Growing Endowments
 
✓ A permanent endowment is intended to exist in perpetuity, which is a 
fancy way of saying it’s meant to last forever. In other words, the endow-
ment funds themselves aren’t meant to be used up or spent. You can 
draw down only income dollars and appreciation for your purpose.
 
✓ A term endowment is set up with an expiration date. When you reach 
that date, some or all of the principal must be spent.
 
Keep in mind that many endowments are at least started with one huge gift 
from one source. But you can add to the endowment over the years.
Deciding whether you can (and should) 
build an endowment
Endowments aren’t for every organization. Universities and community foun-
dations are the prototypical endowment candidates (though not the only 
ones — today churches are beginning to add endowments, as well) because 
they share the following characteristics that normally make an organization a 
good fit for an endowment:
 
✓ They’ve been around for a while and are expected to be around for 
many more years to come.
 
✓ They have a reasonably guaranteed constituency. Whereas your com-
munity arts project may fade away if the founding members lose interest 
or move away, people are likely to want to provide a college education 
for kids for a long, long time.
 
✓ Their mission is broad enough. A community foundation that serves the 
community’s needs, no matter what they may be, can adapt its mission 
as times change.
How do you know your organization has what it takes to build one? Here are 
a few key elements to look for:
 
✓ You have a completely committed board and staff that will stick with 
you through a lengthy process of endowment building.
 
✓ You have a very clear mission and a strong fundraising program already 
in place.
 
✓ You have someone who can serve as an endowment figurehead — 
someone who’s visible in your community and who inspires trust and 
attracts money and support.
 
✓ You have the resources to provide donors with sound investment 
advice and management and a demonstrable investment strategy to 
attract donors.

334
Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
 
✓ You have access to the level of givers needed to seed an endowment 
with substantial gifts upfront.
 
✓ You’re part of an organization in which the long term is important.
 
 When you build an endowment, you’re talking to people about the idea of 
your group’s longevity. Many donors want to see that the money they 
give results in a program or visible change today. If you can help people 
see the future and encourage them to get excited about the people you 
will serve and the programs you will offer down the road, you can get 
them to give. But remember: If you want donors to be excited about what 
you will do tomorrow, show them the great things you’re doing today.
Building an Endowment
In an ideal world, you pick up the phone one morning, and Mr. Gray, a local 
billionaire, tells you he’s giving $2 million to your group for an endowment, no 
strings attached. You thank Mr. Gray profusely, hang up, and shout, “Yes!!”
Although it isn’t impossible that your organization will receive a gift large 
enough to form the basis of an endowment right out of the blue, it is more 
likely that you’ll have to build an endowment in a methodical way. The fol-
lowing sections show you how to do just that.
Getting your board to buy in
The first step in building an endowment is to get everybody on your board to 
agree that an endowment is the right way to go. Everyone needs to commit to 
the long haul, and everyone has to feel confident that you can continue your 
other forms of fundraising and keep all your core programs and functions 
running, while also building an endowment.
 
While you discuss possibilities for your endowment, think through the mes-
saging you can use to explain the endowment to potential donors. Why is an 
endowment a natural fit for your organization? What tangible benefits will 
donors be able to see after they’ve contributed? Having strong answers to 
these questions can also help you convince resistant members of your own 
group that building an endowment is a good idea.
After all the key members of your organization are on board, set a goal 
of getting a handful of significant donations as the start of your endow-
ment. People give money to endowments when they see that the endow-
ment already has a solid financial base. To that end, find out whether your 
board members themselves have contacts who are able to give such large 

335
 Chapter 23: Building and Growing Endowments
gifts. And don’t forget foundations and corporations as potential major 
gift givers. See Chapter 9 for more about how to cultivate major givers and 
Chapter 22 for how to approach foundations and corporations.
After you have a few large gifts that make up the centerpiece of your endow-
ment, plan and run a long-term campaign to solicit additional gifts.
Explaining the value to donors
Some people aren’t crazy about endowments because they think an orga-
nization that has some financial security may be less responsive to its con-
stituency. If your mission addresses one specific issue, donors may wonder 
whether you’re more interested in providing for the security of your organi-
zation or solving the problem you’re supposed to address.
Although an endowment can offer some protection from the giving whims 
of the public, your mission guarantees your commitment to your service, 
whether you’re struggling to fund your livelihood or not. And because many 
social problems are interrelated, if the one your mission addresses is resolved 
completely, you can likely find a related cause to turn your efforts toward. For 
example, if a cure is found for a disease, you still have to address the issue of 
fair distribution of that cure to populations that need it most. If you lower the 
number of homeless people in your town, you still need to be sure that the 
population trains for and maintains jobs to keep them off the street.
 
The financial independence provided by an endowment lets your organization 
focus on solving problems and raising money for special programs. With very 
few exceptions, an endowment isn’t a blank check. It’s a cushion that allows 
you to focus most of your attention on the important issues like feeding the 
hungry or building homes for the homeless.
Making an endowment part of your 
overall fundraising effort
Getting an endowment in place may take many years, so don’t count your 
endowment eggs before they hatch. In the meantime, you have to keep your 
other fundraising efforts, such as your annual fund drive and special pro-
gram fundraising, going strong. Be sure that you have enough staff or vol-
unteers to handle all your fundraising activities. Also, be sure that donors 
understand the different types of funding you’re now seeking. If possible, 
encourage them to support both the ongoing costs of your organization and 
its long-term sustainability.

Endowment Building by Diana S. Newman (Wiley).
Managing an Endowment
As you think through your plan for building an endowment, put considerable 
thought into what it’ll take to manage the endowment effectively. The people 
who donate to your endowment demonstrate their trust in your organization, 
and you need to have good administrative processes, strong investment strate-
gies, and responsible stewardship practices in place to honor that trust.
Providing oversight and 
establishing policies
Establishing the infrastructure of people and processes for your endowment 
is an important part of providing for its long-term success. Many organiza-
tions today set up a separate committee or a separate board to oversee the 
endowment (that is, a group separate from your board of directors); doing so 
ensures that both the best interests of the organization and the best interests 
of the endowment are considered in decisions related to endowment issues. 
Depending on the way you set up your endowment-oversight committee, you 
may choose to have directors serving on both boards so that each board 
is aware of the activities of the other. You may also choose to work with a 
lawyer to set up a formal trust or foundation with a trustee to administer it.
After you set up your oversight committee, you need to create an endowment 
policy document that lays out policies regarding the following:
 
✓ Governance structure
 
✓ Gift acceptance policy
 
✓ Gift restrictions
 
✓ Donor recognition
 
✓ Investment strategy
 
✓ Spending policy
Strong policies and management structure give your board, staff, and 
constituents confidence in the stability of your endowment. To find out 
more about policies and procedures for your endowment, check out Board 
Source (www.boardsource.org), a nonprofit organization specializing in 
board effectiveness.

 Chapter 23: Building and Growing Endowments
 
If you have restricted endowment funds, don’t forget that someone has to 
ensure that any income from the endowment is used in strict accordance with 
that restriction. Spending the funds any other way is illegal. (See the following 
section for more details.)
Seeking professional help to 
manage endowment dollars
Most endowed organizations have an investment manager on staff to deal with 
daily investment issues, but even those with staff typically rely on outside 
resources for help. Investment companies can offer a lot of help with your 
investment program, but you don’t want to let the investment company con-
trol the endowment. It’s important to stay actively involved in and informed 
about your endowment. Have an independent accountant keep close tabs on 
the endowment funds — how they’re earning and how they’re used.
 
You can use several different software programs to help manage your endow-
ment fund. MIP Endowment Management (www.mip.com) and Fundriver 
Online (www.fundriver.com) are two software products currently available. 
In general, however, only very large endowments use this type of software 
because these types of services may be very expensive.
Where do you go from here?
Getting and running an endowment isn’t for the 
faint of heart, but if you think your organization 
is ready for one, here are some helpful sources 
to check out:
 ✓ National Association of College and 
University Business Officers (www.
nacubo.org): Offers various confer-
ences and seminars on endowment 
management
 ✓ Commonfund (www.commonfund.org): 
Maintains a list of seven principles of 
endowment management, covering topics 
such as managing risks and selecting a 
fund manager
 ✓ Foundation & Endowment Money

articles on all aspects of endowments, as 
well as a list of useful links to sites about 
philanthropy and foundations

and professionals who specialize in work-
ing with endowments

Part IV: Engaging Your Givers with the Right Campaigns 
As you set up your investment strategy, keep in mind that many organiza-
tions are now looking at alternative investments that support their organiza-
tions’ missions. For example, you may invest in environmentally responsible 
companies or funds if your own mission is to clean up the environment. For 
help with finding alternative investments, explore options with your board 
members and talk with your investment manager to find out what other orga-
nizations serving your industry’s area are currently doing.
 
Check the laws and regulations regarding endowments and trust laws in your 
state to be sure of your obligations. When you’re dealing with such a large 
sum of money, having solid professional help and advice from both legal and 
financial perspectives are musts. Setting up and administering an endowment 
is like running a good-sized business — professionalism is a must. But the 
return on your investment of time, energy, and resources can be the long-term 
financial security of your organization and its work.

Ten Predictions about Fundraising
In This Chapter
▶ Noting the changes in givers and giving patterns
▶ Watching women become a more important force in giving
▶ Keeping tabs on the new roles nonprofits adopt in their communities
▶ Taking a closer look at the costs of fundraising
O
ne of the lasting effects of going through a tough economic time is a 
diminished feeling of security. Givers become more cautious; organiza-
tions become more selective; individuals evaluate donation opportunities 
more carefully before deciding where to give. As the economy improves and 
the fundraising landscape changes, growth will come again, bringing with it 
changes, unique ideas, and new approaches. This chapter offers predictions 
about how fundraising will change in the years to come.
Huge Amounts of Wealth 
Will Be Transferred
Before the great economic meltdown of 2007 to 2009, experts happily esti-
mated that older generations would transfer from $40 to $106 trillion to 
future generations over the next 45 years — making it the greatest genera-
tional transfer of wealth in history.
Scholars based this estimate on assumptions about the huge baby boomer 
population that’s focusing on estate planning, the drafting of wills, and the 
passing on of wealth. This estimate also took into effect the U.S. stock market 
and the dramatic appreciation on investments in the last 20 years. Enhancing 
the estimate even further was modern technology which made stock owner-
ship more common. More than 40 percent of the U.S. population currently 
owns stock, a statistic that’s up from 29 percent just 12 years ago.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Unfortunately, the world has changed. Between 2007 and 2009, stock port-
folios took a hit that may have reduced their investment values by up to 40 
percent. Nevertheless, the generational wealth transfer will be sizeable in the 
next few decades, which is an important issue for planned-giving campaigns. 
The estimated amount to be transferred may be only $20 to $50 trillion, but 
it’s still serious money. Lots of folks will be in a position to leave a major 
legacy in the near future.
Givers Will Become More Savvy
People have gained access to a wealth of advice and information thanks to the 
Internet. Legal sites provide articles and kits for writing wills, creating trusts, 
and planning estates. Books abound with suggestions on how to handle your 
money, many of which give advice about the tax advantages of giving or struc-
turing your estate to leave bequests to charities or other causes. In short, 
givers are becoming more savvy about when, why, and how to give, so you 
need to know how to keep up with them. (Check out Chapter 7.)
Even with all this self-help, however, people aren’t handling their financial 
planning alone. Lawyers, accountants, investment advisors, and estate plan-
ners are cultivating a vast new market of potential givers. These profession-
als provide the expert advice that creates new contributions to the nonprofit 
sector. The various giving mechanisms we cover in this book are the tools 
that they use, and the personal relationships they build with clients will have 
a major impact on philanthropic giving.
Early indications suggest that the following means for giving will flourish:
 
✓ Using private foundations to fund issues that people care about
 
✓ Setting up trust accounts with community foundations
 
✓ Adding bequests to philanthropic organizations to wills
 
✓ Creating major gifts, planned gifts, and challenge grants (see Chapter 21)
In short, givers will become more tactical and strategic. They’ll want to know 
their gifts will make a difference. Planned giving will become more important, 
and donors will want to be sure their gifts’ recipients follow their intentions. 
In some cases they will ensure that happens by specifying that the money is 
to be distributed within a given period after their deaths.
 
People’s preference will still be to give to a cause they care about instead of 
forcing their heirs to pay high inheritance and estate taxes. As a result, as 
increasingly informed donors make plans for their accumulated wealth, their 
choices may result in increased giving. If it does, the historic rate of personal 
giving as a percent of personal income  may grow.

343
 Chapter 24: Ten Predictions about Fundraising
Attorneys General Will Become 
Major Regulators of Nonprofits
Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been the major overseer of 
the nonprofit world (through the tax code that differentiates for-profits from 
nonprofits), as a fundraiser, you must now consider a new force in each state. 
In past centuries, attorneys general were the public’s representatives in the 
charitable world. However, these office holders seldom became involved in 
that world, and few constituents asked them to intercede.
With the proliferation of state nonprofit statutes that grant attorneys general 
specific nonprofit-related responsibilities, the relationship between nonprofits 
and their attorneys general and the office holders themselves are now in the 
limelight. For instance, most states require all nonprofits to send a copy of Form 
990, which they prepare for the IRS, to their own state’s attorney general for 
review. In addition, as attorneys general have become more politically ambi-
tious, they’ve found that getting involved in the allegedly suspect nonprofit 
world is one way to gain favorable publicity that may lead to higher office.
In some states, attorneys general have responded to questionable fundraising 
activities, alleged improper administration, and possible violations of trust in 
the nonprofit world. Attorneys general can contest the actions of nonprofit 
leaders. In short, they represent the public viewpoint.
Most responsible attorneys general realize how important the nonprofit sector 
is to society and are reluctant to sully its reputation. Rather than create public 
confrontations, attorneys general often work with nonprofits to ensure that 
they execute their fiduciary responsibilities properly. In the future, nonprofits 
will seek the counsel of their state’s attorney general more and more.
As a case in point, Earlham College and the Conner Prairie Interactive History 
Park were involved in a controversy over which of the two organizations 
would be the beneficiary of a major grant worth millions of dollars. The 
donor had given the money to Earlham College provided that it first benefited 
Conner Prairie. The remainder of the gift was to benefit Earlham. Questions 
about expenditures and stewardship inevitably arose. The Indiana attorney 
general, Steve Carter, didn’t want either organization to have its reputation 
publicly sullied by the situation because he recognized that both organiza-
tions were important elements in the community. He was able to negotiate 
a settlement that was court supported, and, as a result, both organizations 
were able to move forward without harm to their public reputations.

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Women Will Play a Bigger Role in Giving
Today women own more than half of all investments in America. As they age, 
their salaries will increase, and they will inherit wealth from parents and 
spouses. In fact, 85 percent of women will control their family’s wealth at 
some point according to the Woman’s Philanthropy Institute.
 
Because women continue to gain influence in the financial world, you need to 
spend some time and effort understanding how to find and cultivate female 
donors. You can begin by asking yourself these questions:
 
✓ What types of causes do they tend to support?
 
✓ What kind of financial concerns do they have that may differ from their 
husband’s, father’s, or brother’s?
 
✓ What will they want to leave as a legacy when they pass on?
Women’s giving programs are proliferating throughout the United States. United 
Way, for example, offers special giving groups that design their fundraising 
activities around women’s issues. Community foundations also often have spe-
cial donor-designated funds that support women’s causes. In short, women are 
having a big impact on giving — and that impact is expected to increase.
More than half of all volunteers are women, and more women are becoming 
important fundraisers. We believe that, in general, women make great fund-
raisers for the same reason they make good salespeople — because they’re 
good listeners. For that reason, we expect the fundraising profession to be 
increasingly populated with women in the future.
E-Giving Will Grow
The emergence of online commerce as a major factor in retailing is a relatively 
recent phenomenon. However, in the second quarter of 2009 alone, U.S. retail-
ers enjoyed online sales of $32.4 billion. For a variety of reasons, online fund-
raising approaches represent a similar opportunity for nonprofits of all types.
E-mail is rapidly taking the place of many direct mail communications because 
it’s less expensive, more flexible, and can be used to target specific audiences. 
In other areas of fundraising, electronic communication is replacing paper-and-
postage methods as well. As a result, click-and-mortar approaches (as opposed 
to brick and mortar) will be the winning combination for successfully marketing 
nonprofit causes. In other words, it’s important to have a convenient location 
where your nonprofit actually does its work, but you need to have a reaching 
presence online, too, because a click on the Internet is likely to be the simplest 
and easiest way to get contributions in the future.

345
 Chapter 24: Ten Predictions about Fundraising
 
Adding an online element to your fundraising efforts offers many benefits that 
will become more prevalent in the future. For one, the development of secure 
online payment systems like PayPal now makes donating online safe for 
donors, which means you can expect your number of online contributions to 
grow. Online fundraising also enables you to mobilize support quickly for 
time-sensitive issues. For example, when a food pantry is running short on 
donations, you can contact donors right away via e-mail or through your Web 
site or social network site to secure additional contributions. When you take 
your fundraising online, you communicate in the realm in which many of your 
younger donors are most comfortable. As a result, social marketing can bring 
many new — and more closely engaged — donors to your site and cause.
Nonprofits Will Go Commercial
Burton A. Weisbrod, a Northwestern University professor who published the 
book To Profit or Not to Profit: The Commercial Transformation of the Nonprofit 
Sector (Cambridge University Press), believes that the commercialization of 
many parts of the nonprofit world is inevitable. He cites decreases in govern-
mental and contributed funding that force nonprofits to sell something — 
often in competition with for-profit organizations. Weisbrod points out that 
the nonprofit sector has been both criticized and acclaimed for its trend 
toward commercialization. He writes, “The rationale for its special tax treat-
ment and subsidies rests on the belief that it provides services that are 
materially different from, and preferred to, the services that private enter-
prise provides.” When the demand for nonprofit services goes up and the 
necessary financing isn’t available, commercialization occurs.
Thus, scholars predict that nonprofits will dramatically increase their use 
of revenues other than voluntary contributions. As they do, the interactions 
and relationships between nonprofits and the rest of the economy become 
more common. In some cases — especially with hospitals, universities, and 
some social service providers — the drive for revenue brings nonprofits into 
headlong competition with private enterprise. For example, the nonprofit 
YMCA and YWCA sometimes find themselves in direct competition with for-
profit recreational organizations.
In addition to seeing competition between nonprofit and for-profit ventures, 
you likely will see increased cooperation and a blurring of the lines between 
the two entities. For example, the government may rely on nonprofits to imple-
ment certain government programs rather than attempt to do the work itself. 
Nonprofit universities conduct scientific research for the benefit of private 
firms. Universities also enter into major deals with private companies that sell 
athletic equipment and other products that often benefit from alliances with 
the universities’ reputations. In other words, the private sector has already 
found a way to profit from the aura and reputation of the nonprofit sector.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Nowhere in the economy is the competition and cooperation between non-
profits and for-profits more obvious than in the healthcare industry, where 
nonprofit hospitals advertise for business, cooperate with for-profit ventures 
when advantageous, and ardently compete when necessary.
The ultimate extension of commercialism is the voluntary conversion of non-
profits into commercial ventures. Although the IRS, through its regular auditing 
procedure, may suspend the tax status of a nonprofit and thus convert it to 
a for-profit venture, the more likely conversion takes place voluntarily by the 
nonprofit that finds that the nonprofit structure and the rules and regulations 
that go with it make competition difficult. For example, in today’s society, con-
version of mutual insurance companies and healthcare providers to for-profit 
status has become commonplace. Conversions of this kind are usually the 
result of decisions by management that the mission of the organization can best 
be met in the for-profit world. For example, conversion makes it possible for the 
company to seek different kinds of financing from the for-profit marketplace.
In addition to voluntary conversions, some states have attempted to define 
nonprofits by requiring that a certain percentage of revenue be contributed 
income or that a certain percent of revenues received should be used for 
philanthropic purposes. Although no consensus exists on what percentages 
are reasonable, some nonprofits will no doubt have to convert to for-profit 
status to survive.
 
Even though a nonprofit may become more commercial or competitive, the 
nonprofit doesn’t necessarily break faith with the core values or primary 
reasons why it was created in the first place. Both objectives — becoming 
more commercial and fulfilling the organization’s mission — can coexist.
Nonprofits Will Increase Their Role 
in Community Leadership
As many U.S. cities and towns lose local and national corporate headquar-
ters, the local community will become more dependent on philanthropic 
leadership. Except in the largest metropolitan areas, community foundations, 
large nonprofits (including hospitals), and large individual givers will become 
more important leaders. Where wealth accumulates, the people who control 
it gain power. Government and the business sector have always been impor-
tant leaders in local communities, but with the help of community founda-
tions, nonprofits can become almost coequal partners.

347
 Chapter 24: Ten Predictions about Fundraising
 
Community foundations and large private foundations have become important 
conveners around community problems and are often the initiators for fund-
ing community needs. They’re often the funders of major community plans 
and visions for the future. Ultimately, community foundations and nonprofits 
like them will have a say in virtually every aspect of community life.
Inheritance Tax Law Changes Will 
Change the Giving Game
The federal inheritance tax law, as it exists in 2009, calls for the tax to be 
completely eliminated in 2010. Nonprofit experts have debated for decades 
the effect this tax has on individual giving. Some say it substantially affects 
large gifts, while others say most of those large gifts would take place with or 
without the tax incentive. Although economic studies differ, some evidence 
supports the idea that potential inheritance liability for heirs affects giving 
decisions. The familiar refrain is, “Why not give your money to something 
you care about instead of letting the government take it?”
Although the inheritance tax isn’t one of the larger revenue producers for the 
federal government, Congress is particularly sensitive to revenue decreases 
during the recent period of record deficits. As currently administered, the 
tax allows deductions of $3.5 million per estate and then taxes the remainder 
at accelerating rates, depending on the size of the estate. Chances are that 
Congress will allow only a $1 million exemption in 2011 and beyond. Regardless 
of the outcome, planned-giving programs will need to react to the changes.
Corporations Will Jump on the Cause-
Related Marketing Bandwagon
Corporations have begun to realize that aligning themselves with a worthy 
cause not only improves their image with the buying public but also offers 
lucrative benefits in marketing punch. When you approach corporations in 
the future, consider the marketing angle of your proposal. For example:
 
✓ Can you think of a company-sponsored event that would get the corpo-
ration’s name and logo out there in a positive way?
 
✓ Can you interest the corporation in a promotion in which a portion of 
what it gets for its products goes into your coffers? The corporation gets 
new customers and higher sales that far outweigh the amount of money 
it hands over to you from its sales.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Would the company like to place your logo on its promotional materials, 
attracting the buyer who has sympathy for your cause, and pay you a 
royalty for the use of your name?
 
✓ Would the company like to create an employee workday built around 
your cause?
These types of co-marketing ventures will grow more and more popular as 
corporations look for the quid pro quo for their charitable efforts. (Check out 
Chapter 22 for more about corporation-related fundraising strategies.)
Fundraising Costs Will Be Scrutinized
The relationship between the amount of money given to an organization 
and the percent that the organization puts toward the cause for which the 
money was solicited has received growing scrutiny. In recent years, the U.S. 
Congress has focused on nonprofit governance and charitable integrity. In 
addition, attorneys general have used state nonprofit statutes to review the 
actions of nonprofits in their states. Public opinion polls continue to reflect 
skepticism about how nonprofits spend the money they collect. In some 
states, audits may be conducted for public review.
For these reasons, the importance of communicating clearly and honestly 
how much money you raise as a nonprofit, how much it costs to raise the 
money, and how much you actually spend on your organization’s mission will 
become critical for you and all nonprofits. Equally important is your orga-
nization’s ability to demonstrate effectiveness in your mission. The public’s 
trust is at stake with these issues, and they are at the heart of maintaining 
your donor relationships.
 
Many nonprofit organizations are adopting a version of the Public Trust 
Initiative started by the Donor’s Forum of Chicago as part of their efforts to 
show the public that they can and should be trusted to fulfill their missions.

Chapter 25
Ten (Plus One) 
Great Opening Lines
In This Chapter
▶ Engaging your donor right away
▶ Showing donors how they make a difference
▶ Connecting with your donor
P
ersonal visits to donors are important for a couple of reasons. First, 
nothing beats good, old-fashioned, face-to-face contact for building rela-
tionships. And second, people find it very hard to turn down someone who’s 
looking them in the eyes. So try out some of the lines in this chapter (or your 
own versions of them) the next time you meet your donor face to face.
“How about a little good news?”
Especially in turbulent economic times, people may feel saturated with bad 
news. When you show up on the doorstep with your organization’s materi-
als, start with the good news. Describe all the great things your organization 
is doing. And don’t forget to mention specifically how the donor’s gifts have 
contributed to major successes since your last meeting.
“Would you like to watch the 
birth of a baby elephant?”
Get the donor hooked right away. What does he care about? What interests 
him? Capture his imagination as soon as you can, and he’ll be eager to hear 
your next word.

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
“Hi, Mrs. Jones, I just left a meeting 
where we were discussing . . .”
This natural comment can lead right into whatever you want to address with 
Mrs. Jones — a new program, a building, a campaign, and so on. You don’t 
want to flounder around here — or leave the impression that you’re making it 
up just to create a graceful transition into what you really want to talk about — 
so use this statement only when it’s true. You may, of course, change it to “I 
was just thinking about . . .” or “We were just talking about planning. . . .”
“I recently visited the program you 
sponsored. Very inspiring! I’d love 
to show it to you sometime.”
Not only does this line get the donor’s imagination going as she wonders 
about the effects of her gift, but it also recognizes her for her past donations 
and invites her to come with you to see the results.
“Now, how can I help you?”
This kind of question may get a baffled look and the comment, “I thought you 
wanted something from me!” But it does open the door to the idea that fund-
raisers really do help donors find positive and proven ways to facilitate good 
in the world and meet their financial planning goals, as well.
“Research shows that giving 
is good for your health.”
Said to the right people (like a group of doctors), this opening line gets 
donors listening right off the bat. Why? First of all, we want it to be true. 
Second, it tells donors upfront that their philanthropic endeavors will benefit 
them. If for no other reason, donors will continue listening just so they can 
look for an opportunity to disprove you.

351
 Chapter 25: Ten (Plus One) Great Opening Lines
“You have no idea how much good your 
last gift did for our organization!”
Recognition is a good thing — especially when you can say something sub-
stantial about the results of the donor’s past contributions.
 
Misrepresentation is never the best policy. Don’t get in to see a donor under 
false pretenses. Acting like you’re conducting a survey at a festival when 
you’re really looking for an opportunity to promote your organization only 
creates distance between you and the prospective donor. Sure, use your 
opportunities, but do so in a forthright manner.
“More people go to zoos today than go 
to all sports activities combined.”
This “Gee whiz!” statement really gets people interested. What kind of “Gee 
whiz!” statements can you come up with about your own organization and 
its causes? Take an afternoon and research trivia or statistics related to your 
area. The Internet offers great tools for this kind of research. The interest you 
gain — and the conversations that take place — will be more than worth the 
expense of your research time.
“Seven out of ten of our city’s families 
use United Way services 
in their lifetime.”
This “Gee whiz!” statement is based on fact and may appeal to both logical 
and emotional types. Know the good your organization has done and be 
ready and willing to talk about it. Distill the facts down to three or four good 
opening lines that may interest a prospective donor and leave him wanting to 
find out more about what you do.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
“Hey, I just received this great picture! 
The new wing of the library is finished!”
Especially for people who have already given to your organization, seeing 
evidence of the great things you’re doing is very heady stuff. Show donors 
a picture of the newly renovated monkey exhibit at your zoo, display your 
newly purchased property, or make known the turnout at the recent fundrais-
ing event you sponsored.
 
The Web isn’t the same direct-contact medium as face-to-face visiting, but you 
can put images on your Web site that show happy people doing good work 
and suggest that your prospective donor visit the site. Images are a great idea 
on Facebook, too, because when you post images, they appear in the news 
feeds of all your fans.
“Cute dog!”
Hey, what’s the best way to a pet lover’s heart? Liking her dog! This approach 
may seem like an old salesman’s gimmick, but there’s an important idea at 
the center here: Connection is key. When your donor realizes that you share 
some common interests, she starts listening.
