Preface
Most organizations can reduce their costs associated with the ﬂow of materials
substantially. Inventory control techniques are very important components in this
development process. A thorough understanding of relevant inventory models is
more or less a prerequisite for successful implementation. I hope that this book will
be a useful tool in acquiring such an understanding.
The book is primarily intended as a course textbook. It assumes that the reader
has a good basic knowledge of mathematics and probability theory, and is therefore
most suitable for industrial engineering and management science/operations research
students. The book can be used both in undergraduate and more advanced graduate
courses.
About 15 years ago I wrote a Swedish book on inventory control. This book
has been used in courses in production and inventory control at several Swedish
engineering schools and has also been appreciated by many practitioners in the ﬁeld.
Positive reactions from many readers made me contemplate writing a new book in
English on the same subject. Encouraging support of this idea from the Springer
Editors Fred Hillier and Gary Folven ﬁnally convinced me to go ahead with that
project.
The resulting ﬁrst edition of this book was published in 2000 and contained quite
a lot of new material that was not included in its Swedish predecessor. It has since
then been used in quite a few university courses in different parts of the world, and
I have received many positive reactions. Still some readers have felt that the book
was too compact and some have asked for additional topics. Some of those who have
used the book as a textbook have also requested more problems to be solved by the
students. The Springer Editors Fred Hillier and Gary Folven then persuaded me to
publish a Second Edition of my book. This new version was quite different from
the previous one. My main goal was to make the new book more suitable as a text-
book. The explanations of different results were more detailed, and a considerable
number of exercises were added. I also included several new topics. These addi-
tional topics include: alternative forecasting techniques, more material on different
stochastic demand processes and how they can be ﬁtted to empirical data, generalized
treatment of single-echelon periodic review systems, capacity constrained lot sizing,

Preface
short sections on lateral transshipments and on remanufacturing, coordination and
contracts.
The present revision, which resulted in this Third Edition can be seen as a con-
tinuation of the previous revision. The main focus is still to provide more detailed
explanations and in that way make the book easier to read.
When working with different versions of the book I have been much inﬂuenced
by other textbooks and various scientiﬁc articles. I would like to thank the authors
of these books and papers for indirectly contributing to my book.
There are also a number of individuals that I would like to thank. Before I started
to work on the second revision, Springer helped me to arrange a review process,
where a number of international scholars were asked to suggest suitable changes in
the book. These scholars were: Shoshana Anily, Tel Aviv University, Saif Benjaafar,
University of Minnesota, Eric Johnson, Dartmouth College, George Liberopoulos,
University of Thessaly, Suresh Sethi, University of Texas-Dallas, Jay Swaminathan,
University of North Carolina, Ruud Teunter, Lancaster University, Geert-Jan Van
Houtum, Eindhoven University of Technology, Luk Van Wassenhove, INSEAD, and
Yunzeng Wang, Case Western Reserve University. Some of them had used the ﬁrst
edition of the book in their classes. The review process resulted in most valuable
suggestions for improvements, and I want to thank all of you very much.
Several colleagues of mine at Lund University have helped me a lot. I would
especially like to mention Johan Marklund for much and extremely valuable help
with both the First and the Second Edition, and Kaj Rosling for his important sug-
gestions concerning the First Edition. Furthermore, Jonas Andersson, Peter Berling,
Christian Howard, Lina Johansson, Fredrik Olsson, Olle Stenius, Patrik Tydesjö, and
StefanVidgren have reviewed the manuscript at different stages and offered valuable
suggestions which have improved this book considerably. Thank you so much.
Finally, I would also like to thank the Springer people: Fred Hillier, Gary Fol-
ven, Carolyn Ford, Matthew Amboy, Christine Crigler, and Manoj Mishra for their
support, and Sharon Bowker for polishing my English.

Introduction
1.1
Importance and Objectives of Inventory Control
For more or less all organizations in any sector of the economy, Supply Chain Man-
agement, i.e., the control of the material ﬂow from suppliers of raw material to ﬁnal
customers is a crucial problem. Today the strategic importance of this area is fully
recognized by top management. The total investment in inventories is enormous, and
the control of capital tied up in raw material, work-in-progress, and ﬁnished goods
offers a very important potential for improvement. Scientiﬁc methods for inventory
control can give a signiﬁcant competitive advantage. This book deals with a wide
range of different inventory models that can be used when developing inventory
control systems.
Inventories cannot be decoupled from other functions, for example purchasing,
production, and marketing. As a matter of fact, the objective of inventory control
is often to balance conﬂicting goals. One goal is, of course, to keep stock levels
down to make cash available for other purposes. The purchasing manager may wish
to order large batches to get volume discounts. The production manager similarly
wants long production runs to avoid time-consuming setups. He also prefers to have
a large raw material inventory to avoid stops in production due to missing materials.
The marketing manager would like to have a high stock of ﬁnished goods to be able
to provide customers a high service level.
One way to understand which roles inventories can play is to use a func-
tional classiﬁcation. Silver et al. (1998), for example, consider six broad decision
categories:
In practice it is common to produce in batches due to ordering and/or setup costs.
The resulting stock increase is usually denoted cycle inventories or cycle stock. (We
can also see this as an example of economies of scale.)
Uncertainties in supply and demand together with lead-times in production and
transportation inevitably create a need for safety stocks. Safety stock is the amount
of inventory kept on hand, on the average, to allow for variations in demand and
supply.
Anticipation inventory is accumulated stock that you plan to use for an expected
future peak in sales.

Introduction
Pipeline inventory is stock that has been ordered but has still not been delivered.
Such inventories include work-in-process.
Decoupling stock is used to permit a decentralization of the inventory control by
separation of the decision-making at different stock points.
Although a functional classiﬁcation like this may be very helpful, it is also im-
portant to understand that the different types of inventories interact with each other.
Assume that we decide to use a larger batch quantity for some item. This means
larger cycle stock. But larger batches also mean that we need less safety stock to
keep the same customer service. So both a larger safety stock and a larger cycle stock
will increase the service level.
Most organizations can reduce their inventories without increasing other costs by
using more efﬁcient inventory control tools. Furthermore, advances in information
technology have drastically changed the possibilities to apply efﬁcient inventory
control techniques. The recent progress in research has resulted in new and more
general methods that can reduce the supply chain costs substantially. The ﬁeld of
inventory control has indeed changed during the last decades. It used to mean ap-
plication of simple decision rules, which essentially could be carried out manually.
Modern inventory control is based on quite advanced and complex decision models,
which may require considerable computational efforts.
There are important inventory control problems in all supply chains. For those
who are working with logistics and supply chains, it is difﬁcult to think of any
qualiﬁcation that is more essential than a thorough understanding of basic inventory
models.
1.2
Overview and Purpose of the Book
The main purpose of this book is that it should be useful as a course textbook.
However, it has also turned out to be very useful for many practitioners working
with logistics. The structure of the book is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.
After this introduction we consider different forecasting techniques in Chap. 2.
We focus on methods like exponential smoothing and moving average procedures for
estimating the future demand from historical demand data, because such methods are
most common in practical applications. We also provide techniques for evaluating
the size of forecast errors.
Chapters 3–6 deal with basic inventory problems for a single installation and
items that can be handled independently. More precisely, Chap. 3 presents various
basic concepts. Chapter 4 deals with deterministic lot sizing and Chap. 5 with safety
stocks and reorder points. In Chap. 6 we discuss integration and optimality.
The contents in Chaps. 2–6 provide the foundation for an efﬁcient standard
inventory control system, which can include:
• A forecasting module, which periodically updates demand forecasts and evaluates
forecast errors.

A reader who already has a reasonably good background in forecasting can skip
Chap. 2 and go directly to Chap. 3.
In Chap. 7 we leave the assumption of independent items and consider co-
ordinated replenishments. Both production smoothing models and so-called joint
replenishment problems are analyzed.
Chapters 8–10 focus on multi-echelon inventory systems, i.e., on several installa-
tions which are coupled to each other. The installations can represent, for example,
stocks of raw materials, components, work-in-process, and ﬁnal products in a pro-
duction system, or a central warehouse and a number of retailers in a distribution
system. In Chap. 8 we consider structures and ordering policies. Chapter 9 deals
with lot sizing and Chap. 10 with safety stocks and reorder points.
Finally, in Chap. 11 we discuss various practical problems in connection with
implementation of inventory control systems.
Over the years a substantial number of excellent books and overview papers deal-
ing with various inventory control topics have been published. A selection of these
publications is listed at the end of this chapter. A natural question then is why this
book is needed. To explain this, note ﬁrst that this book is different from most other
books because it also covers very recent advances in inventory theory, for example
new techniques for multi-echelon inventory systems and Roundy’s 98 % approxi-
mation. Furthermore, this book is also different from most other books because it

Introduction
assumes a reader with a good basic knowledge of mathematics and probability the-
ory. This makes it possible to present different inventory models in a compact and
hopefully more efﬁcient way. The book attempts to explain fundamental ideas in
inventory modeling in a simple but still rigorous way. However, to simplify, several
models are less general than they could have been.
Because the book assumes a good basic knowledge of mathematics and prob-
ability theory, it is most suitable for industrial engineering and management
science/operations research students. It can be used in a basic undergraduate course,
and/or in a more advanced graduate course.
Chapter 2 may be omitted in a course which is strictly focused on inventory
control. If it is included, it should probably be the ﬁrst part of the course. Chapters 3–
6 should precede Chaps. 7–10. Chapter 7 can either precede or succeed Chaps. 8–10.
Chapter 11 should come at the end of the course.
An undergraduate course can, for example, be based on the following parts of
the book: Sects. 2.1–2.6, 2.10–2.12, Chaps. 3–4, Sects. 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.3–5.8, 5.13,
6.3, 7.2.1, 8.1, 8.2.1–8.2.2, 8.2.4–8.2.5, 9.1, 9.2.1, Chap. 11.
For students that have taken the suggested undergraduate course, or a correspond-
ing course, a graduate course can build on a selection of the remaining parts of the
book, e.g., Sects. 5.1.2–5.1.5, 5.2.2, 5.9–5.12, 5.14–5.15, 6.1–6.2, 7.1, 7.3, 8.2.3,
9.2–9.3, Chap. 10.
A graduate course for students that have no prior knowledge of inventory control
but a good mathematical background should include most of the material suggested
for the undergraduate course, but can exclude some of the sections suggested for the
graduate course.
Another purpose of this book is to describe and explain efﬁcient inventory control
techniques for practitioners and in that way simplify and promote implementation
in practice. The book can, e.g., be used as a handbook when implementing and
adjusting inventory control systems.
1.3
Framework
Models and methods in this book are based on the cost structure that is most common
in industrial applications. We consider holding costs including opportunity costs of
alternative investments, ordering or setup costs, and shortage costs or service level
constraints. An important ﬁrst question is whether a certain considered item should
be stocked or not. We will not deal with, for example, inventory problems related to
ﬁnancial speculation, i.e., when the value of an item can be expected to increase, or
withaggregateplanningmodelsforsmoothingproductionincaseofseasonaldemand
variations. The interaction with production is recognized through setup costs but also
in some models by explicit capacity constraints. The book does not cover production
planning settings that are not directly related to inventory control.
See Sect. 3.1 for more details.

1.3
Framework
5
The models considered in the book assume that the basic conditions for inventory
control are given, for example in the form of demand distributions, lead-times,
service requirements, and holding and ordering costs. In practice, most of these
conditions can be changed at least in the long run. There are, consequently, there are
many important questions concerning inventories that are related to the structure and
organization of the inventory control system. Such questions may concern evaluation
of investments to reduce setup costs, or whether the customers should be served
through a single-stage or a multi-stage inventory system. Although we do not treat
such questions directly, it is important to note that a correct evaluation must always
be based on inventory models of the type considered in this book. The question is
always whether the savings in inventory-related costs are larger than the costs for
changing the structure of the system.

Chapter 2
Forecasting
There are two main reasons why an inventory control system needs to order items
some time before customers demand them. First, there is nearly always a lead-time
between the ordering time and the delivery time. Second, due to certain ordering
costs, it is often necessary to order in batches instead of unit for unit. These two
reasons mean that we need to look ahead and forecast the future demand. A demand
forecast is an estimated average of the demand size over some future period. But
it is not enough to estimate the average demand. We also need to determine how
uncertain the forecast is. If the forecast is more uncertain, a larger safety stock is
required. Consequently, it is also necessary to estimate the forecast error, which may
be represented by the standard deviation or the so-called Mean Absolute Deviation
(MAD).
2.1
Objectives and Approaches
In this chapter we shall focus on forecasting methods that are suitable in connection
with inventory control. Typical for such forecasts is that they concern a relatively
short time horizon. Very seldom do we need to look ahead more than one year. Other
types of forecasts may very well concern many years. In general, there are then two
types of approaches that may be of interest:
•
Extrapolation of historical data
When extrapolating historical data, the forecast is based on previous demand data.
The available techniques are grounded in statistical methods for analysis of time
series. Such techniques are easy to apply and use in computerized inventory con-
trol systems. It is no problem to regularly update forecasts for thousands of items,
which is a common requirement in connection with practical inventory control.
Extrapolation of historical data is the most common and important approach to
obtain forecasts over a short horizon, and we shall devote the main part of this
chapter to such techniques. The idea is to identify a simple demand pattern that can
be assumed to describe the demand process. This demand model usually includes
some stochastic element.

Forecasting
•
Forecasts based on other factors
It is very common that the demand for an item depends on the demand for some
other items. Consider, for example, an item that is used exclusively as a component
when assembling some ﬁnal products. It is then often natural to ﬁrst forecast
the demand for these ﬁnal products, for example by extrapolation of historical
data. Next we determine a production plan for the products. The demand for
the considered component is then obtained directly from the production plan.
This technique to “forecast” demand for dependent items is used in Material
Requirements Planning (MRP) that is dealt with in Sect. 8.2.4.
But there are also other factors that might be reasonable to consider when forecasting
demand. Assume, for example, that a sales campaign is just about to start or that a
competing product is introduced on the market. Clearly this can mean that historical
data is no longer representative when looking ahead. It is normally difﬁcult to take
such factors into account in the forecasting module of a computerized inventory
control system. It is therefore usually more practical to adjust the forecast manually
in case of such special events.
It is also possible, at least in principle, to use other types of dependencies. A
forecast for the demand of ice cream can be based on the weather forecast. Consider,
as another example, forecasting of the demand for a spare part that is used as a
component in certain machines. The demand for the spare part can be expected to
increase when the machines containing the part as a component are getting old. It
is therefore reasonable to look for dependencies between the demand for the spare
part and previous sales of the machines. As another example we can assume that
the demand during a certain month will increase with the advertising expenditure
the previous month. Such dependencies could be determined from historical data
by regression analysis. (See Sect. 2.7.) Direct applications of such techniques are,
however, very limited.
2.2
Demand Models
Extrapolation of historical data is, as mentioned, the most common approach when
forecasting demand in connection with inventory control. To determine a suitable
technique, we need to have some idea of how to model the stochastic demand. In
principle, we could try to determine the model from analysis of historical data. In
practice this is very seldom done. With many thousands of items, this initial work
does not seem to be worth the effort in many situations. In other situations there
are not enough historical data. A model for the demand structure is instead usually
determined intuitively. In general, the assumptions are very simple.

2.2
Demand Models
9
2.2.1
Constant Model
The simplest possible model means that the demands in different periods are rep-
resented by independent random deviations from an average that is assumed to be
relatively stable over time compared to the random deviations. Let us introduce the
notation:
xt = demand in period t
a = average demand per period (assumed to vary slowly)
εt = independent random deviation with mean zero
A constant model means that we assume that the demand in period t can be
represented as
xt = a + εt.
(2.1)
Many products can be represented well by a constant model, especially products that
are in a mature stage of a product life cycle and are used regularly. Examples are
consumer products like toothpaste, many standard tools, and various spare parts. In
fact, if we do not expect a trend or a seasonal pattern, it is in most cases reasonable
to assume a constant model.
Let us assume that the stochastic variables εt are independent and have the same
distribution. Assume also that the parameter a is a constant that we do not know. The
natural estimate of a is then the average of all previous demands xt. However, if a
is not constant and instead is varying slowly it should reasonably be better to use
only a number of the latest demands. This is the basic idea both when using Moving
average (Sect. 2.3) and Exponential smoothing (Sect. 2.4).
2.2.2
Trend Model
If the demand can be assumed to increase or decrease systematically, it is possible
to extend the model by also considering a linear trend. Let
a = average demand in period 0
b = trend, that is the systematic increase or decrease per period (assumed to vary
slowly)
A trend model means that the demand is modeled as:
xt = a + bt + εt.
(2.2)
During a product life cycle there is an initial growth stage and a phase-out stage at the
end of the cycle. During these stages it is natural to assume that the demand follows
a trend model with a positive trend in the growth stage and a negative trend in the
phase-out stage.

Forecasting
2.2.3
Trend-seasonal Model
Let
Ft = seasonal index in period t (assumed to vary slowly)
If, for example, Ft = 1.2, this means that the demand in period t is expected to be 20 %
higher due to seasonal variations. If there are T periods in 1 year, we must require
that for any T consecutive periods T
k=1 Ft+k = T . When using a multiplicative
trend-seasonal demand model it is assumed that the demand can be expressed as
xt = (a + bt)Ft + εt.
(2.3)
By setting b = 0 in (2.3) we obtain a constant-seasonal model.
In (2.3) it is assumed that the seasonal variations increase and decrease propor-
tionally with increases and decreases in the level of the demand series. In most cases
this is a reasonable assumption. An alternative assumption could be that the seasonal
variations are additive.
Many products have seasonal demand variations. For example the demand for
ice cream is much larger during the summer than in the winter. Some products, like
various Christmas decorations, are only sold during a very short period of the year.
Still, the number of items with seasonal demand variations is usually very small
compared to the total number of items. A seasonal model is only meaningful if the
demand follows essentially the same pattern year after year.
2.2.4
Choosing Demand Model
When looking at the three demand models considered, it is obvious that (2.2) is more
general than (2.1), and that (2.3) is more general than (2.2). It may then appear that it
should be most advantageous to use the most general model (2.3). This is, however,
not true. A more general demand model covers a wider class of demands, but on
the other hand, we need to estimate more parameters. Especially if the independent
deviations are large, it may be very difﬁcult to determine accurate estimates of the
parameters, and it can therefore be much more efﬁcient to use a simple demand
model with few parameters. A more general model should be avoided unless there
is some evidence that the generality will give certain advantages.
It is important to understand that the independent deviations εt cannot be fore-
casted, or in other words, the best forecast for εt is always zero. Consequently, if the
independent deviations are large there is no possibility to avoid large forecast errors.
Consider the constant model (2.1). It is obvious that the best forecast is simply our
best estimate of a. In (2.2) the best forecast for the demand in period t is similarly
our best estimate of a + bt, and in (2.3) our best forecast is the estimate of (a + bt)Ft.
In some situations it may be interesting to use more general demand models
than (2.1)–(2.3). (See Sect. 2.9.) This would, however, require a detailed statistical

analysis of the demand structure. In practice this is rarely done in connection with
inventory control.
One practical problem is that it is quite often difﬁcult to measure demand, since
only sales are recorded. If historical sales, instead of historical demands, are used for
forecasting demand, considerable errors may occur in situations where a relatively
large portion of the total demand is lost due to shortages. (See Sect. 2.10.5.)
2.3
Moving Average
Assume that the underlying demand structure is described by the constant model
(2.1). Since the independent deviations εt cannot be predicted, we simply want to
estimate the constant a. If a were completely constant the best estimate would be to
take the average of all observations of xt. But a can in practice be expected to vary
slowly. This means that we need to focus on the most recent values of xt. The idea of
the moving average technique is to take the average over the N most recent values.
Let
ˆat
= estimate of a after observing the demand in period t
ˆxt,τ = forecast for period τ > t after observing the demand in period t
We obtain:
ˆxt,τ = ˆat = (xt + xt−1 + xt−2 + · · · + xt−N+1)/N.
(2.4)
Note that the forecasted demand is the same for any value of τ > t. This is, of course,
because we are assuming a constant model.
The value of N should depend on how slowly we think that a is varying, and on
the size of the stochastic deviations εt. If a is varying more slowly and the stochastic
deviations are larger, we should use a larger value of N. This will limit the inﬂuence
of the stochastic deviations. On the other hand, if a is varying more rapidly and the
stochastic variations are small, we should prefer a small value of N, which will allow
us to follow the variations in a in a better way.
If we use one month as our period length and set N = 12, the forecast is the average
over the preceding year. This may be an advantage if we want to prevent seasonal
variations from affecting the forecast.
2.4
Exponential Smoothing
2.4.1
Updating Procedure
When using exponential smoothing instead of a moving average, the forecast is up-
dated differently. The result is in many ways similar, though. We are again assuming
a constant demand model, and we wish to estimate the parameter a. To update the

12
2
Forecasting
forecast in period t, we use a linear combination of the previous forecast and the
most recent demand xt,
ˆxt,τ = ˆat = (1 −α)ˆat−1 + αxt,
(2.5)
where τ > t and
α = smoothing constant (0 < α < 1)
Due to the constant demand model the forecast is again the same for any future
period.
Note that the updating procedure can also be expressed as
ˆxt,τ = ˆat = ˆat−1 + α(xt −ˆat−1).
(2.6)
We have assumed that 0 < α < 1 although it is also possible to use α = 0 and α = 1.
The value α = 0 means simply that we do not update the forecast, while α = 1 means
that we choose the most recent demand as our forecast.
2.4.2
Comparing Exponential Smoothing to a Moving Average
To be able to compare exponential smoothing to a moving average, we can express
the forecast in the following way:
ˆat = (1 −α)ˆat−1 + αxt = (1 −α)((1 −α)ˆat−2 + αxt−1) + αxt
= αxt + α(1 −α)xt−1 + (1 −α)2 ˆat−2 = · · · = αxt + α(1 −α)xt−1.
+ α(1 −α)2xt−2 + · · · + α(1 −α)nxt−n + (1 −α)n+1 ˆat−n−1
(2.7)
Let us now compare (2.7) to (2.4). In (2.4) the N last period demands all have the
weight 1/N. In (2.7) we have, in principle, positive weights for all previous demands,
but the weights are decreasing exponentially as we go backwards in time. This is the
reason for the name exponential smoothing. The sum of the weights is still unity.1
When using a moving average, a larger value of N means that we put relatively more
emphasis on old values of demand. When applying exponential smoothing, a small
value of α will give essentially the same effect.
When using a moving average according to (2.4) the forecast is based on the
demands in periods t, t – 1, . . . , t–N + 1. The ages of these data are respectively 0,
1, . . . , and N – 1 periods. The weights are all equal to 1/N.
1 Let 0 ≤x < 1 and consider the inﬁnite geometric sum S(x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 · · · Note that
S(x) = 1 + x · S(x). This implies that S(x) = 1/(1 −x). The sum of the weights in (2.7) is
α · S(1 −α) = 1.

(2.8)
The forecasts are based on data of the “same average age” if
(1 −α)/α = (N −1)/2,
(2.9)
or equivalently when
α = 2/(N + 1).
(2.10)
Consider, for example, a moving average that is updated monthly with N = 12. This
means that each month in the preceding year has weight 1/12. Consider then an expo-
nential smoothing forecast that is also updated monthly.A value of α “corresponding”
to N = 12 is according to (2.10) obtained as α = 2/(12 + 1) = 2/13 ≈0.15.
2.4.3
Practical Considerations and an Example
If the period length is one month, it is common in practice to use a smoothing constant
α between 0.1 and 0.3.
We can see from Table 2.1 that the forecasting system will react much faster if
we use α = 0.3. On the other hand, the stochastic deviations will affect the forecast
more compared to when α = 0.1. When choosing α we always have to compromise.
If the forecast is updated more often, for example each week, a smaller α should
be used. To see how much smaller, we can apply (2.10) as a reasonable approxi-
mation. Assume that we start with a monthly update and that we use the value of α
“corresponding” to a moving average with N = 12, i.e., α ≈0.15. When changing to
weekly forecasts it is natural to change N to 52. The “corresponding” value of α is
obtained from (2.10) as α = 2/(52 + 1) ≈0.04.
When starting to forecast according to (2.5) in some period t, an initial forecast
to be used as ˆat−1 is needed. We can use some simple estimate of the average period
2 Let 0 ≤x < 1 and consider the inﬁnite geometric sum S′(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x2 . . . = 1 + x + x2 +
... + x(1 + 2x + 3x2...) = S(x) + x · S′(x)This implies that S′(x) = S(x)/(1 −x) = 1/(1 −x)2.

demand. If no such estimate is available, it is possible to start with ˆat−1 = 0, since
ˆat−1 will not affect the forecast in the long run, see (2.7). However, especially for
small values of α, it can take a long time until the forecasts are reliable. If it is
necessary to start with a very uncertain initial forecast, it may be a good idea to use a
rather large value of α to begin with, since this will reduce the inﬂuence of the initial
forecast.
Example 2.1
The demand for an item usually ﬂuctuates considerably. A moving
average or a forecast obtained by exponential smoothing gives essentially an average
of more recent demands. The forecast cannot, as we have emphasized before, predict
the independent stochastic deviations. Table 2.2 shows some typical demand data
and the corresponding exponential smoothing forecasts with α = 0.2. It is assumed
that the forecast after period 2 is ˆa2 = 100.
In Table 2.2 the forecast immediately after period 3 is obtained by applying (2.5).
ˆa3 = 0.8 · 100 + 0.2 · 72 = 94.4,
which is rounded to 94 in Table 2.2. (The forecasts should normally only be rounded
in the ﬁnal output.) Note that when determining ˆa3 the demands in future periods are
not known. Therefore at this stage, ˆa3 serves as our forecast for any future period.
After period 4 the forecast is again updated
ˆa4 = 0.8 · 94.4 + 0.2 · 170 = 109.52.
If we compare exponential smoothing to a moving average there are some obvious
but minor advantages with exponential smoothing. Because the average a, which we
wish to estimate is assumed to vary slowly, it is reasonable to use larger weights for
the most recent demands as is done in exponential smoothing. As we have discussed
before, however, a moving average over a full year may be advantageous if we want
to eliminate the inﬂuence of seasonal variations on the forecast. It is also interesting
to note that with exponential smoothing we only need to keep track of the previous
forecast and the most recent demand.

2.5
Exponential Smoothing with Trend
15
2.5
Exponential Smoothing with Trend
In practice, exponential smoothing (or possibly a moving average) is, in general, a
suitable technique for most items. But there is also usually a need for other methods
for relatively small groups of items for which it is feasible and interesting to follow
up trends and/or seasonal variations.
2.5.1
Updating Procedure
Let us now instead assume that the demand follows a trend model according to (2.2).
To forecast demand we need to estimate the two parameters a and b, compared to
only a in case of a constant model. As before, we cannot predict the independent
deviations ετ. There are different techniques for estimating a and b. We shall here
consider a method that was ﬁrst suggested by Holt (1957). (Another technique based
on linear regression is described in Sect. 2.7.) Estimates of a and b are successively
updated according to (2.11) and (2.12).
ˆat = (1 −α)(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1) + αxt,
(2.11)
ˆbt = (1 −β)ˆbt−1 + β(ˆat −ˆat−1),
(2.12)
where α and β are smoothing constants between 0 and 1.
The “average” ˆatcorresponds to period t, i.e., the period for which we have just
observed the demand. The forecast for a future period, t + k is obtained as
ˆxt,t+k = ˆat + k · ˆbt.
(2.13)
The most important difference compared to simple exponential smoothing according
to (2.5) is that the forecasts for future periods are no longer the same. Note that the
trend, i.e., the change per period, can just as well be negative.
The method means that ˆatis always adjusted to ﬁt the present period. With this in
mind, (2.11) is essentially equivalent to (2.5). As long as xt is unknown, ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1
is our best estimate for the mean demand in period t. We determine ˆat as a linear
combination of this estimate and the new demand xt. The average difference between
two consecutive values of ˆat should in the long run be equal to the trend. Therefore,
we use these differences in (2.12) to update the trend by exponential smoothing.
It can be shown that if the demand is a linear function without stochastic variations,
the forecast will, in the long run independent of the initial values, estimate the future
demand exactly. When using simple exponential smoothing this is not the case. See
Problem 2.4.

2.5.2
Practical Considerations and an Example
The idea behind exponential smoothing with trend is to be able to better follow
systematic linear changes in demand. As with exponential smoothing, larger values
of the smoothing constants α and β will mean that the forecasting system reacts faster
to changes but will also make the forecasts more sensitive to stochastic deviations.
When choosing values in practice it can be recommended to have a relatively low
value of β since errors in the trend can give serious forecast errors for relatively long
forecast horizons. Note that the trend is multiplied by k in (2.13). It is therefore very
unfortunate if pure stochastic variations are interpreted as a trend. When updating
the forecast monthly, typical values of the smoothing constants may be α = 0.2 and
β = 0.05. When the forecasting system is initiated it is usually reasonable to set
the trend to 0 and, as in exponential smoothing, let the initial ˆa be equal to some
estimate of the average period demand. If the initial values are very uncertain it can be
reasonable, also for exponential smoothing with trend, to use extra large smoothing
constants in an initial phase.
Example 2.2
We consider the same demand data as in Example 2.1. Table 2.3
illustrates the forecasts when applying exponential smoothing with trend and looking
one and ﬁve periods ahead, respectively. The smoothing constants are α = 0.2 and
β = 0.1. At the end of period 2, ˆa2 = 100 and ˆb2 = 0.
In period 3 we obtain from (2.11) and (2.12)
ˆa3 = 0.8 · (100 + 0) + 0.2 · 72 = 94.4,
ˆb3 = 0.9 · 0 + 0.1 · (94.4 −100) = −0.56.
Our forecast for period 4 is then 94.4 – 0.56 = 93.84 ≈94. At the end of period 4 we
obtain the real demand 170. Applying (2.11) and (2.12) again we get
ˆa4 = 0.8 · (94.4 −0.56) + 0.2 · 170 = 109.072,
ˆb4 = 0.9 · (−0.56) + 0.1 · (109.072 −94.4) = 0.9632,
The forecasts in Table 2.3 are rounded to integers.

2.6
Winters’ Trend-seasonal Method

2.6
Winters’Trend-seasonal Method
Let us now assume that the demand is modeled by a multiplicative trend-seasonal
model, see (2.3). Such a model is usually only used for a few items with very clear
seasonal variations like Christmas decorations.
2.6.1
Updating Procedure
Winters (1960) suggested the following technique that can be seen as a generalization
of exponential smoothing with trend. We shall describe how the parameters a, b, and
Ft are updated. Note ﬁrst that in (2.3), a + bt represents the development of demand
if we disregard the seasonal variations. When we record the demand xt in period t,
we can similarly interpret xt/ ˆFt as the demand without seasonal variations. At this
stage we have not updated ˆFt with respect to the new observation xt. In complete
analogy with (2.11) and (2.12) we now have
ˆat = (1 −α)(ˆat−1 + ˆbt−1) + α(xt/ ˆFt),
(2.14)
ˆbt = (1 −β)ˆbt−1 + β(ˆat −ˆat−1),
(2.15)
It remains to update the seasonal indices. We ﬁrst determine
ˆF ′
t = (1 −γ ) ˆFt + γ (xt/ˆat),
(2.16)
and
ˆF ′
t−i = ˆFt−i for i = 1,2, . . . , T −1,
(2.17)
where 0 < γ < 1 is another smoothing constant. Recall thatT is the number of periods
per year. Note that (2.17) means that the other indices are left unchanged in this initial
step. We must also require, however, that the sum of T consecutive seasonal indices
is equal to T. Therefore, we need to normalize all indices
ˆFt−i = ˆF ′
t−i(T/
T −1

k=0
ˆF ′
t−k) for i = 0,1, . . . , T −1.
(2.18)
These indices are also applied to future periods until the indices are updated the next
time. For example,
ˆFt−i+kT = ˆFt−i for i = 0,1, . . . , T −1,
and k = 1,2, . . . .
(2.19)
The forecast for period t + k is obtained as
ˆxt,t+k = (ˆat + k · ˆbt) ˆFt+k.
(2.20)

18

Forecasting
An alternative is to use manually set seasonal indices. In this case we do not need to go
through (2.16) – (2.19). In practice this is often reasonable because of its simplicity.
The corresponding constant seasonal model is obtained if (2.14) and (2.15) are
replaced by
ˆat = (1 −α)ˆat−1 + α(xt/ ˆFt),
(2.21)
and (2.20) by
ˆxt,t+k = ˆat ˆFt+k.
(2.22)
2.6.2
Practical Considerations and an Example
Example 2.3 To illustrate the computations we shall go through a complete updating
of all parameters. Assume that we are dealing with monthly updates, i.e., that T =
12. The smoothing constants are α = 0.2, β = 0.05, and γ = 0.2. Assume that the
last update took place in period 23 and that this update resulted in the following
parameters: ˆa23 = 9, ˆb23 = 1, ˆF12 = ˆF13 = ˆF14 = 1.2, ˆF15 = ˆF16 = ˆF17 = ˆF18 =
1, ˆF19 = 0.4 and, ˆF20 = ˆF21 = ˆF22 = ˆF23 = 1. Note that the sum of the seasonal
indices equals 12. At this stage ˆF24 = ˆF12 = 1.2 according to (2.19).
In period 24 we record the demand x24 = 7. Applying (2.14)–(2.16) we get
ˆa24 = 0.8(9 + 1) + 0.2(7/1.2) = 9.167
ˆb24 = 0.95 · 1 + 0.05(9.167 −9) = 0.958
ˆF ′
24 = 0.8 · 1.2 + 0.2 · (7/9.167) = 1.113
We obtain 24
i=13 ˆF ′
i = 11.913. By applying (2.18) we get the updated normalized
indices for periods 13–24 as ˆF13 = ˆF14 = 1.209, ˆF15 = ˆF16 = ˆF17 = ˆF18 = 1.007,
ˆF19 = 0.403, ˆF20 = ˆF21 = ˆF22 = ˆF23 = 1.007, and ˆF24 = 1.121.
The forecast for period 26 is obtained from (2.20) as
ˆx24,26 = (9.167 + 2 · 0.958) · 1.209 = 13.40,
where we apply ˆF26 = ˆF14 according to (2.19).
When using a trend-seasonal method, which also updates the seasonal indices, it is
quite often difﬁcult to distinguish systematic seasonal variations from independent
stochastic deviations. The problem is that we have so many parameters to estimate.
The indices may then become very uncertain. Therefore it can sometimes be more
efﬁcient to estimate the indices in other ways. For example, if a group of items can be
expected to have very similar seasonal variations, it may be advantageous to estimate
the indices from the total demand for the whole group of items. By doing so we can
limit the inﬂuence of the purely stochastic deviations. Assume, for example, that

2.7
Using Regression Analysis
19
we have a number of items that can all be classiﬁed as Christmas decorations. By
aggregating historical demand data for all items in this group, it may be possible to
estimate seasonal indices that are quite accurate for all items in the group together.
We can, for example, use Winter’s procedure as described above for determining the
indices for the aggregate data. Furthermore, we can usually assume that the obtained
indices are also reasonably accurate for the individual items in the group. So when
determining forecasts for individual items we regard these aggregate seasonal indices
as given.
In general, it can also be recommended that only items with very obvious seasonal
variations be accepted as seasonal items.
2.7

2.7.1
Forecasting Demand for a Trend Model
Assume once again a demand model with trend according to (2.2). One technique
to forecast the future demand has been described in Sect. 2.5. Let us consider an
alternative technique. Assume that we have just obtained the demand in period t and
that we wish to base the forecast on the N most recent observations xt, xt-1, . . . ,
xt-N + 1. One possibility is to use so-called least square regression, which means that
we ﬁt a line yt+k = ˆat + ˆbtk to the observations so that the sum of the squared errors
is minimized for k = −N + 1, – N + 2, . . . , 0. We can then use yt + k for k > 0 as
our forecast for period t + k, i.e., we set ˆxt,t+k = yt+k.
Let us now determine ˆat and ˆbt. We wish to minimize the convex function

Practical Considerations and an Example
This technique based on least square regression can be seen as a generalization of a
moving average (Sect. 2.3) to a demand model with trend, in the same way as we can
see exponential smoothing with trend (Sect. 2.5) as a generalization of exponential
smoothing (Sect. 2.4). When determining ˆat and ˆbt by linear regression, we give the
same weight to the N most recent known demands as we do when determining a
moving average. Furthermore, if instead of ﬁtting a line to the observations, we ﬁt
a constant ˆat so that the sum of the squared errors is minimized for k = −N + 1,
– N + 2, . . . , 0, we will obtain a moving average. See Problem 2.5. Normally it
is reasonable to give more weight to more recent observations as is done when
applying exponential smoothing with trend, which has also become a more common
forecasting technique.
Example 2.4 Let us go back to the data in Example 2.2 where we applied exponen-
tial smoothing with trend. Assume that the demands in periods 3–7 are given. The
corresponding values of k are k = −4, – 3, . . . ,0. See Fig. 2.1.

2.7
Using Regression Analysis
21
In Example 2.2 we updated an initial forecast ˆa2 = 100 and ˆb2 = 0 successively.
In period 7 we got ˆa7 = 106.1571 and ˆb7 = 0.567955. See Fig. 2.1, where the
corresponding forecasts ˆx7,7+k = ˆa7 + ˆb7k are illustrated. In the ﬁgure we also
show the line for k ≤0, although these values are not used because we already
know the demands. We have also used least square regression (2.26)–(2.29) based
on the demands in periods 3, 4, . . . , 7 to determine ˆa7 = 115 and ˆb7 = 4.1. The
corresponding forecast is also illustrated in Fig. 2.1. Again we also show the line for
k ≤0, although these values are not used as forecasts.
In this example we have only used ﬁve demands, N = 5, when determining the
linear regression forecast. For the considered demand variations, which are rather
typical, it is normally better to use a considerably larger N (N ≥10) to get a more
stable forecast. It is easy to see from Fig. 2.1 that an occasional very high or very
low demand can affect the forecast considerably.
2.7.3
Forecasts Based on Other Factors
The application of linear regression for forecasting demand in case of a trend model
is fairly limited. Usually exponential smoothing with trend is preferred. Of more
practical interest is to use linear regression when the demand depends on one or
more other factors that are known when making the forecast.
Consider as an example a spare part that is exclusively used as a replacement
when maintaining a certain machine. The maintenance activities are carried out by
the company selling the spare part, and the customers have to order the maintenance
2 months in advance. In such a case it is natural to assume that the demand for
the spare part in the next month is essentially proportional to the known number of
machines undergoing maintenance in that month. Let
xt = demand in month t
zt = number of machines undergoing maintenance in month t
It is then natural to assume the following demand model
xt = a + bzt + εt,
(2.30)
where a and b are constants and εt are independent random variations with mean zero.
Note now that we can ﬁt a line yt+k = ˆat + ˆbtzt+k to the N most recent observations
so that the sum of the squared errors is minimized, exactly as we did in Sect. 2.7.1,
where we dealt with the special case zt + k = k. We can then use yt + k for k > 0 as
our forecast for period t + k, i.e., we set ˆxt,t+k = yt+k. In complete analogy with
Sect. 2.7.1 we get
ˆbt =

optimal solution is obtained by setting ˆbt = 0. From (2.32) we then get ˆat = ¯x, i.e.,
simply a moving average.
2.7.4
More General Regression Models
Several generalizations of the models considered in Sects. 2.7.1–2.7.3 are possible.
We can include more than one factor by using multiple regression, i.e., the demand
model may be expressed as
xt = a +
J

j=1
bjzj,t + εt
(2.35)
Such models are, however, not common when forecasting demand in connection
with inventory control.
Furthermore, some nonlinear relationships can easily be transformed into linear
models. Assume, for example, that we wish to choose positive parameters ˆat and ˆbt
so that the function
yt+k = ˆat ˆbzt+k
t
(2.36)
closely follows some previous demand data. If we take logarithms of both sides we
get
log yt+k = log ˆat + ( log ˆbt)zt+k,
(2.37)
and we can then use simple linear regression to determine log ˆat and log ˆbt.

Sporadic Demand
Sometimes an item is demanded very seldom, while the quantity that is demanded by
a customer may be relatively large. It may, for example, turn out that customers order
only about twice per year. If we use exponential smoothing the resulting forecast will
decrease in periods without demand and go up again when a customer arrives. If we
use a small smoothing constant the forecast will still be relatively stable, but on
the other hand, it will react very slowly to demand changes. Croston (1972) has
suggested a simple technique to handle such a situation. The forecast is only updated
in periods with positive demand. In case of a positive demand, two averages are
updated by exponential smoothing: the size of the positive demand, and the time
between two periods with positive demand. This gives a more stable forecast and
also a better feeling for the structure of the demand. Let as before xt be the demand
in period t. Deﬁne also
kt = the stochastic number of periods since the preceding positive demand
ˆkt = estimated average of the number of periods between two positive demands at
the end of period t
ˆdt = estimated average of the size of a positive demand at the end of period t
ˆat = estimated average demand per period at the end of period t
We update ˆkt and ˆdt in the following way:
I. xt = 0
ˆkt = ˆkt−1,
ˆdt = ˆdt−1,
(2.38)
II. xt > 0
ˆkt = (1 −α)ˆkt−1 + αkt,
ˆdt = (1 −β) ˆdt−1 + βxt,
(2.39)
where 0 < α, β < 1 are smoothing constants.
We get the forecast for the demand per period as
ˆat = ˆdt/ˆkt.
(2.40)
2.9
Box-Jenkins Techniques
The stochastic variations in the demand models that we have considered, (2.1)–
(2.3), are assumed to be independent. This is a major simpliﬁcation. It is, however,
easy to realize that situations exist when this is not true. If there are only a few large
customers we can sometimes expect demands in consecutive periods to be negatively
correlated. A high demand in one period can indicate that several of the customers

24
2
Forecasting
have replenished, and it is reasonable to expect that the demand in the next period
will be a little lower. However, there are also situations with positively correlated
demand. A high demand in one period may mean that the product is exposed to more
potential customers, and a high demand can also be expected in the next period.
Forecasting techniques that can handle correlated stochastic demand variations
and other more general demand processes have been developed by Box and Jenkins
(1970). See also Box et al. (1994). Although such models are used very seldom in
connection with inventory control, we shall give a short description of how these
techniques work.
A general non-seasonal demand model is known as an AutoRegressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) model. There is a large variety of such models. It is
common to use the notation ARIMA (p, d, q) where
AR:
p = order of autoregressive part
I:
d = degree of ﬁrst differencing involved
MA: q = order of the moving average part
Consider as an example an ARIMA (p, 0, q) model.
xt = a + b1xt−1 + b2xt−2 + · · · + bpxt−p + εt + c1εt−1 + c2εt−2 + · · · + cqεt−q.
(2.41)
In (2.41) εi are passed errors that, combined with previous demands, are used as
explanatory variables, while bi and ci are constants. The errors are assumed to be
independent and have zero mean. The forecasting technique can be divided into two
steps. In each period all constants are ﬁrst estimated from historical data, and next
the model is used to determine forecasts for future periods. Assume that we want
to forecast the demand in period t, and that we know the outcome in all previous
periods. The error in period t, εt, is then not known and is replaced by zero since it has
zero mean. Otherwise we can use observed values of previous demands and errors.
If we also want to forecast the demand in period t + 1 we increase the subscripts in
(2.41) by one throughout. To get the forecast for xt + 1, we also use our forecast for
xt and we set the unknown errors εt + 1 and εt equal to zero.
More extensive computations are needed to use such a technique. Furthermore, a
relatively large record of historical data must be kept available. This, in connection
with inventory control, can usually only be motivated for a few very important
products. Various computer programs exist for ﬁtting ARIMA models.
The demand model in (2.41) has d = 0. Because of that it is also equivalently
denoted ARMA(p, q). Similarly, if p = 0 we can equivalently say IMA(d, q). If
p = d = 0 we get a MA(q) model.
Let us now consider an ARIMA(p, 1, q) model.
x′
t = a+b1x′
t−1+b2x′
t−2 + · · · + bpx′
t−p + εt + c1εt−1 + c2εt−2 + · · · + cqεt−q.
(2.42)
The only difference compared to (2.41) is that xi is now replaced by x′i = xi −xi−1.
If d = 2, x′i is replaced by x
′′
i = x′i −x′i−1.

2.10
Forecast Errors
25
To illustrate the richness of the class of ARIMA models let us consider a simple
example, ARIMA(0, 1, 1) with a = 0 and c1 = −(1 −α),
xt+1 = xt + εt+1 −(1 −α)εt,
(2.43)
i.e., after observing the demand in period t our forecast for period t + 1 is
ˆat = xt −(1 −α)εt.
(2.44)
Because xt = ˆat−1 + εt, we can rewrite (2.44) as
ˆat = ˆat−1 + αεt = ˆat−1 + α(xt −ˆat−1) = (1 −α)ˆat−1 + αxt.
(2.45)
So we can conclude that exponential smoothing is just a special case of an ARIMA
model.
In practice it is usually sufﬁcient to consider values of p, d, q in the range 0, 1, 2.
This will simplify the model identiﬁcation. Still it is possible to cover a very large
set of practical forecasting situations.
It is also possible to add seasonality toARIMA models. See e.g., Makridakis et al.
(1998).
2.10
Forecast Errors
2.10.1
Common Error Measures
So far we have only discussed how we can estimate the mean of the future demand.
But it is not sufﬁcient only to know the mean. To be able to determine a suitable
safety stock we also need to know how uncertain the forecast is, i.e., how large the
forecast errors tend to be.
The most common way to describe variations around the mean is through the
standard deviation. Let X be a stochastic variable with mean m = E(X). The standard
deviation σ is deﬁned as
σ =

E(X −m)2,
(2.46)
and σ 2 is denoted the variance. In connection with forecast errors it is, by old tradi-
tion, not common to estimate σ or σ 2 directly. Instead the Mean Absolute Deviation
(MAD) is estimated. MAD is the expected value of the absolute deviation from the
mean
MAD = E |X −m| .
(2.47)
The original reason that MAD is estimated instead of σ or σ 2 was that this simpliﬁed
the computations. Today it is no problem to estimate σ or σ 2 directly, but still most
forecasting systems ﬁrst evaluate MAD. It is obvious that MAD and σ in most cases

26
2
Forecasting
give a very similar picture of the variations around the mean. It is also possible
to relate them to each other. A common assumption is that the forecast errors are
normally distributed. In that case it is easy to show that
σ =

π/2 MAD ≈1.25 MAD.
(2.48)
This relationship is very often used in connection with forecasting, also in situations
when it is less natural to assume that the forecast errors are normally distributed.
The approximation √π/2 ≈1.25 is in no way needed but is still quite often used in
practice.
2.10.2
Updating MAD or σ2
We shall now describe how to successively update MAD or σ 2. Let MADt be the
estimate of MAD after period t. At the end of period t – 1 we obtained from the
forecasting system a forecast for period t, ˆxt−1,t. At this stage we could regard this
as a “mean” for the stochastic demand in period t, xt. (Of course, this is not always
true. Very often there are substantial systematic errors in the forecast.) After period t
we know xt and the corresponding absolute deviation from the “mean”,
xt −ˆxt−1,t
.
It is, in general, assumed that these absolute variations can be seen as independent
random deviations from a mean which varies relatively slowly, i.e., that they follow
a constant model according to (2.1). It is then natural to update the average absolute
error, MADt, by exponential smoothing, see (2.5). The forecast for the absolute error
at the end of period t is consequently determined as
MADt = (1 −α)MADt−1 + α
xt −ˆxt−1,t
 ,
(2.49)
where 0 < α < 1 is a smoothing constant (not necessarily the same as in 2.5).
Since the observed absolute deviations usually vary quite a lot, it is common to
use a relatively small smoothing constant like α = 0.1 in the case of monthly updates.
An alternative to (2.49) would be to update MADt as a moving average.
When we have determined MADt we use (2.48) to get the corresponding standard
deviation.
σt =

π/2 MADt ≈1.25 MADt.
(2.50)
In general it is disregarded that the forecast for a more distant period may be
considerably more uncertain than the forecast for the next period.
Example 2.5 We consider the same demand data and the same forecasting technique
(exponential smoothing with trend) as in Example 2.2. Table 2.4 shows the updated
values of MADt when using α = 0.1 and the initial value MAD2 = 20.
Note ﬁrst that the forecast for period 3 in period 2 was ˆa2 + ˆb2 = 100. In period
3 we then obtain from (2.49)
MAD3 = 0.9 · 20 + 0.1 · |72 −100| = 20.8,

and the initial forecast ˆa2 = 100, ˆb2 = 0, see Example 2.2

and similarly in period 4
MAD4 = 0.9 · 20.8 + 0.1 · |170 −93.84| = 26.336.
Note that when updating MAD we use forecasts that are not rounded, e.g., 94.4 –
0.56 = 93.84 instead of 94, see Example 2.2.
A less common technique is to update the variance in the same way
σ 2
t = (1 −α)σ 2
t−1 + α(xt −ˆxt−1,t)2.
(2.51)
When starting to update MAD or σ 2 we need an initial value. This value is easy to
obtain if historical data of forecast errors is available. If such data is not available, it
can be reasonable to determine initial values as functions of the estimated demand.
See Sect. 2.10.3. As we have discussed before concerning forecasts, it may also be
a good idea to use a relatively large smoothing constant during a short initial period
if the initial MAD is very uncertain.
The determination of forecast errors in connection with inventory control is nor-
mally carried out as described in this section. However, other possibilities exist, for
example, in connection with linear regression. See also Sect. 2.10.3.
2.10.3
Determining the Standard Deviation as a Function
of Demand
Sometimes when a forecasting system is initiated we do not have a sufﬁcient amount
of historical data per item to evaluate initial values of MAD or σ. Still, we may have
some idea of the size of the average demand ˆa. In such a situation it is common
to determine an initial value of σ as a function of the average demand. We can get
a corresponding MAD from (2.50). Such functions are sometimes also used as an
alternative to the updating procedures (2.49) or (2.51). This can be reasonable in case
of very low demand, when it may be difﬁcult to get good estimates by using (2.49)
or (2.51). Examples of such items can be certain types of spare parts.

28
2
Forecasting
The forecast errors are nearly always increasing with the average demand, but
the relative errors are decreasing. When determining σ as a function of the average
demand ˆa, a reasonable and common approach is to use the form
σ = k1 ˆak2,
(2.52)
or equivalently
log σ = log k1 + k2 log ˆa,
(2.53)
so we can evaluate logk1 and k2 by linear regression. The same function is used for
many items, so we do not need to go back in time much to get a relatively good
estimate. As before, we can get a corresponding MAD from (2.50).
2.10.4
Forecast Errors for Other Time Periods
Our determination of MADt and σt in Sect. 2.10.2 concerns the forecast error when
we look one period ahead. The error when forecasting the demand in a more distant
period is usually larger. In principle we could update the error for such a forecast
similarly. This is not often done in practice, though. It is most common to use MADt
as the expected absolute error not only for the demand in period t + 1, but also for
the demand in period t + k for k > 1. This means that we usually are underestimating
the errors for such forecasts.
The estimates MADt and σt represent the mean absolute deviation and the standard
deviation of the demand during one period. If σt, for example, is updated monthly,
the time period implicitly considered is one month. In connection with inventory
control it is very common, though, that we need to consider a shorter or a longer
period, e.g., a certain lead-time. Assume that after updating σt in period t, we need
to determine the standard deviation of the forecast error over L time periods, σ(L),
where L can be an y positive number, i.e., not necessarily integral. If, as discussed
above, we disregard that the errors usually increase when forecasting the demand
for a more distant period, and also assume that forecast errors are independent over
time, we obtain:
σ(L) = σt
√
L.
(2.54)
Example 2.6
Assume that MADt is updated each month and that the most re-
cent value is MADt = 40. From (2.50) we obtain σt ≈1.25 × 40 = 50. In case of
independence over time, the standard deviation over two months is obtained as
σ(2) = 50 × 21/2 ≈71, and over 0.5 month as σ(0.5) = 50 × 0.51/2 ≈35.
The determination of σ(L) in (2.54) is very common. It is important, though, to recall
that it is based on the assumptions discussed above. For a long lead-time the standard
deviation is therefore often underestimated. One way to reduce the error is to use

2.11
Monitoring forecasts
29
a forecast period that is of about the same length as the majority of the lead-times.
This will limit the possible error when applying (2.54). If the lead-times vary a lot
it may also be reasonable to update the forecast and the forecast error for different
periods.
Another possibility is to use the following slightly more general relationship
instead of (2.54)
σ(L) = σtLc,
(2.55)
where 0.5 ≤c ≤1. Consider ﬁrst the assumption that the forecast errors are inde-
pendent. The value c = 0.5 corresponds to independence over time and gives (2.54),
while the other extreme c = 1 corresponds to forecast errors that are completely cor-
related over time. However, we can also use c > 0.5 to compensate for disregarding
that the forecast error for a more distant period tends to be larger.
2.10.5
Sales Data Instead of Demand Data
In practice it is quite often difﬁcult to measure the real demand, because if a demand
cannot be met this results in a lost sale that is not accounted for. If it is sales instead
of demand that is observed, the forecast is of course also for the sales. This means a
systematic error that is not considered by the techniques discussed in Sects. 2.10.1–
2.10.4. If we keep a high service level there are very few lost sales and the error can
more or less be disregarded. But situations also exist when this error may be quite
large. An obvious possibility to reduce the error is to try to account for demands
that cannot be met. When a customer asks for some item that is not in stock, this
should be accounted for as a demand. Another possibility is to adjust the forecasting
technique. Consider a certain period and assume that there are 15 units in stock in the
beginning of the period, and that there are no incoming deliveries during the period.
Assume also that demands that cannot be met directly are lost. If the stock on hand
at the end of the period is 5, we know that the period demand was 10. However, if
the stock on hand at the end of the period is 0, we only know that the demand was at
least 15. There are forecasting techniques that take this into account and can provide
more accurate forecasts. See Nahmias (1994).
2.11
Monitoring forecasts
The forecasting methods that we have described will, in general, work excellently for
most items. However, a forecasting system will normally comprise several thousand
items. Various problems will occur for a few of these items in each period. These
problems may depend on errors in the input to the system or on a less appropriate
forecasting technique. This means that there is a need to follow up and check the

30
2
Forecasting
forecasts. It would be extremely time consuming to do this manually for all items.
It is therefore usually suitable to let the forecasting system itself perform certain
automatic tests to check whether an item should go through a detailed manual ex-
amination. These tests are similar to techniques used in connection with statistical
quality control. The tests are performed each time the forecasts are updated and result
in a list of items that should be checked in more detail. If necessary the forecast-
ing procedure can be reinitiated for some of these items with new initial values and
possibly new parameters, e.g., smoothing constants.
Two types of tests that are very often done automatically are to check whether
the input, i.e., the new demand, is reasonable, and to evaluate whether the forecast
represents the mean adequately.
2.11.1
Checking Demand
If the forecasting system works well, MAD and the corresponding standard deviation
σ illustrate how much the demand can be expected to deviate from the forecast.
Assume that in period t −1 we obtained a certain forecast for period t, ˆxt−1,t and
a certain MADt−1. If ˆxt−1,t can be regarded as the mean and the deviations of the
demand from the forecast are normally distributed, we can determine the probability
that the forecast error in period t is within k standard deviations as,
P(|xt −ˆxt−1,t| < kσt−1) = 	(k) −	(−k),
(2.56)
where 	(·) is the cumulative normal distribution function. See Appendix 2. It is
common to use the test
|xt −ˆxt−1,t| < k1MADt−1 = k1σt−1/

π/2,
(2.57)
with k1 = 4 to check whether xt is “reasonable”. (When checking xt it is appropriate
to use MADt −1 instead of MADt, which has been affected by the demand that we
are checking.) By applying (2.56) with k = 4/√π/2 ≈3.19, we can see that the
probability that the test should be satisﬁed is approximately 99.8 % under normal
conditions. Consequently, if (2.57) is not satisﬁed there is probably some error in
the new demand or in the forecast, alternatively, an event with a very low probability
has occurred. Anyway it is reasonable to check the item manually. If it turns out that
there is an error, it should be corrected. After that the forecasting system for the item
is restarted with new initial values.
2.11.2
Checking that the Forecast Represents the Mean
The determination of MADt in (2.49) means that we evaluate the average absolute
error. It is also common to update the average error in a similar way. Let

2.12
Manual forecasts
31
zt = estimate of the average error in period t
In complete analogy with (2.49) we have
zt = (1 −α)zt−1 + α(xt −ˆxt−1,t),
(2.58)
where 0 < α < 1 is a smoothing constant. If the forecast works as a correct mean,
positive and negative forecast errors should be of about the same size in the long run,
and zt can be expected to be relatively close to zero. On the other hand, if zt differs
signiﬁcantly from zero we have reason to believe that the forecast is biased. When
updating zt it is natural to use zero as the initial value and to have a relatively small
smoothing constant like α = 0.1 in case of monthly updates. A common test is
|zt| < k2MADt.
(2.59)
What is a suitable value of the parameter k2? Comparing (2.58) to (2.49), it is evident
that we should expect |zt| < MADt. A reasonable initial value of k2 may be 0.5. If
this leads to too many error signals it can be reasonable to increase k2. Similarly, if
there are very few error signals we can tighten the control by using a smaller k2.
Systematic errors that are detected by (2.59) can have different explanations. One
possibility is that the forecasting method is inadequate. For example, if demand
has a trend and we are using simple exponential smoothing, there will always be
a systematic error. Another common reason is that a large change in the average
demand has occurred. It will then take a long time for the forecast to approach the
new demand level. If such a situation is detected by (2.59), we can improve the
forecasts by restarting the system with a new, more accurate initial forecast.
The tests (2.57) and (2.59) should, in general, be thought of as a basis for man-
ual adjustments of the forecasting system. It is also possible to design an adaptive
forecasting system that makes various adjustments automatically. The system can,
for example, change forecasting method and smoothing constants after performing
various tests. See e.g., Gardner and Dannenbring (1980). Such systems are very
seldom used in practice, though.
2.12
Manual forecasts
Most of the forecasting methods we have discussed in this chapter have the purpose
of extrapolating historical demands as well as possible. There are situations though,
when such forecasting techniques are less suitable. There can be known factors that
will affect the future demand, but which have not affected the previous demand.
In some cases it is possible to model the inﬂuence of such factors as described in
Sect. 2.7.3. However, in general, it is both difﬁcult and impractical to take such
factors into account within a computerized forecasting system. Usually it is much
more practical to let manual forecasts replace automatic forecasts. A forecasting
system should therefore be designed so that such replacements are easy.

32
2
Forecasting
Normally, manual forecasts are only needed for a limited number of items over
relatively short times. It is never a good idea to use a manual forecast if the forecast
simply means an extrapolation of historical data. Such forecasts are obtained much
more easily and with fewer errors by using the various methods that have been
described earlier in this chapter.
Examples of situations when manual forecasts could be considered are:
•
price changes
•
sales campaigns
•
conﬂicts that affect demand
•
new products without historical data
•
new competitive products on the market
•
new regulations
A special problem with manual forecasts is that they sometimes have systematic
errors because of optimistic or pessimistic attitudes by the forecasters.

Chapter 3
Costs and Concepts
In Chaps. 3–6 we consider a large and very important class of inventory problems,
for which, in general, we can offer satisfactory solutions that can be used in practice
relatively easily. This class of systems is characterized by two qualities:
•
Different items can be controlled independently.
•
The items are stocked at a single location, i.e., not in a multi-stage inventory
system.
The ﬁrst condition is very often satisﬁed, but there are also many important counter
examples. When orders are issued to a factory for example, we usually wish to obtain
a smooth production load. This means that we need to coordinate orders for different
items and the condition is evidently not satisﬁed. Another example is when we get a
discount that is based on the total order sum for several items. In that case we wish
to order these items at the same time. We shall deal with such situations in Chap. 7.
There are also many practical settings where the second condition is not satisﬁed.
Forexample, whendistributinganitemoveralargegeographicalregion, itiscommon
to use an inventory system with a central warehouse together with local stocks close
to the ﬁnal customers. Such situations are considered in Chaps. 8–10.
Typical settings where the two conditions are satisﬁed can be found at many
wholesalers. In production there is very often a certain coupling between different
stocks. Sometimes, though, this coupling is so weak that it can be disregarded.
3.1
Considered Costs and Other Assumptions
The models that we deal with are based on certain standard assumptions. In general,
we consider the following costs or constraints. (See also Berling 2005; Silver et al.
1998; Zipkin 2000.)

Costs and Concepts
3.1.1
Holding Costs
By holding stock we have an opportunity cost for capital tied up in inventory. This part
of the holding cost should, in principle, be closely related to the return on an alterna-
tive investment. It is not necessarily equal to the expected return though, because we
also need to take into account ﬁnancial risks associated with alternative investments.
The capital cost is usually regarded to be the dominating part of the holding cost.
Other parts can be material handling, storage, damage and obsolescence, insurance,
and taxes. All costs that are variable with the inventory level should be included.
Consider, for example, the costs for storage space. In some situations with owned
warehouses, these costs may be essentially ﬁxed. This means that they should not
be included in the holding cost. In other situations, however, it may be possible to
increase or decrease rented warehouse space in the short run, and the costs should
consequently be included in the holding cost.
The holding cost per unit and time unit is often determined as a percentage of
the unit value. Note that this percentage can usually not be the same for all types of
items. It should, for example, be high for computers due to obsolescence. In general,
the percentage should be considerably higher than the interest rate charged by the
bank.
An alternative to including the ﬁnancial costs in the holding cost is to consider
the net present value, i.e., the discounted value, of all expenditures and revenues.
See, for example, Grubbström (1980). In this book we will only consider standard
holding costs.
3.1.2
Ordering or Setup Costs
There are usually ﬁxed costs associated with a replenishment (independent of the
batch size). In production, common reasons are setup and learning costs. But there
are also administrative costs associated with the handling of orders. Other ﬁxed costs
can occur in connection with transportation and material handling. The setup cost
may be especially high if an expensive capacity constrained machine has to stop
during the setup. In some situations, though, most of the setup can take place outside
the machine, which reduces the costs.
When ordering from an outside supplier there are also various ﬁxed costs for an
order, like costs of order forms, authorization, receiving, inspection, and handling
of invoices from the supplier.
3.1.3
Shortage Costs or Service Constraints
If an item is demanded and cannot be delivered due to a shortage, various costs
can occur. There are situations when a customer agrees to wait while his order is
backlogged, but also situations when the customer chooses some other supplier. If

3.2
Different Ordering Systems
39
the customer order is backlogged, there are often extra costs for administration, price
discounts for late deliveries, material handling, and transportation. If the sale is lost,
the contribution of the sale is also lost. In any case, it usually means a loss of good
will that may affect the sales in the long run. Most of these costs are difﬁcult to
estimate.
Shortage costs in production are, in general, even more difﬁcult to estimate. If a
component is missing for example, this can cause a chain of negative consequences
like delays, rescheduling, etc.
There are also situations when shortage costs are easy to evaluate. Assume, for
example, that a missing component can be bought at a higher price in a store next
door. We can then use the additional cost as our shortage cost.
Because shortage costs are so difﬁcult to estimate, it is very common to replace
them by a suitable service constraint. Of course it is also difﬁcult to determine
an adequate service level, yet this is regarded to be somewhat simpler in many
practical situations. Still, the motivation for a service constraint is nearly always
some underlying shortage cost.
3.1.4
Other Costs and Assumptions
The above costs are those that are most common in inventory models. Although we
shall in most cases limit our attention to these costs, it is evident that it can also be
relevant to consider other costs.
As discussed in Sect. 3.1.1 the holding cost is usually determined as a percentage
of the unit cost, which is normally obtained as the cost ﬁgure given by accounting.
Otherwise it is in most cases assumed that the unit cost is not affected by inventory
control decisions concerning e.g., order quantity and reorder point. There are some
obvious exceptions, though. One example is when a large order quantity can affect
the unit cost through a discount. See Sect. 4.3.
Other costs that should be considered are the costs of operating the inventory
control system. This includes costs for data acquisition and computation, as well as
costs for training the involved personnel.
In this book, we shall generally, assume that demand is backordered and not lost
in case of a shortage. Models with backordering are usually much simpler, and unless
shortages are very common, can also be used as an approximation in case of lost
sales. A model with lost sales is considered in Sect. 5.14.
3.2
Different Ordering Systems
3.2.1
Inventory Position
The purpose of an inventory control system is to determine when and how much to
order. This decision should be based on the stock situation, the anticipated demand,
and different cost factors.

40
3
Costs and Concepts
When talking about the stock situation, it is natural to think of the physical stock
on hand. But an ordering decision can not be based only on the stock on hand. We
must also include the outstanding orders that have not yet arrived, and backorders,
i.e., units that have been demanded but not yet delivered. In inventory control the
stock situation is therefore usually characterized by the inventory position:
Inventory position = stock on hand + outstanding orders −backorders.
If the customers can reserve units for later delivery, the reserved units are usually also
subtracted from the inventory position. This means that the inventory control handles
the reserved units in the same way as units that have been ordered for immediate
delivery. This may be reasonable unless the delivery time is too distant, which will
result in unnecessary holding costs. If the delivery time is far away, a reasonable
policy is to subtract the reserved units from the inventory position ﬁrst when the
remaining time until delivery is less than a certain time limit. The customers will
then, with a high probability, still get their orders in time. We shall from now on
disregard reservations.
Although the ordering decisions are based on the inventory position, holding and
shortage costs will depend on the inventory level:
Inventory level = stock on hand −backorders.
In some situations the holding costs should also include holding costs for outstanding
orders. The resulting additional cost term is easy to evaluate because the average
outstanding orders are easily obtained as the average lead-time demand.
3.2.2
Continuous or Periodic Review
An inventory control system can be designed so that the inventory position is moni-
tored continuously. As soon as the inventory position is sufﬁciently low, an order is
triggered. We denote this as continuous review. The triggered order will be delivered
after a certain lead-time. Let
L = lead - time.
The lead-time is the time from the ordering decision until the ordered amount is
available on shelf. It is not only the transit time from an external supplier or the
production time in case of an internal order. It also includes, for example, order
preparation time, transit time for the order, administrative time at the supplier, and
time for inspection after receiving the order.
An alternative to continuous review is to consider the inventory position only
at certain given points in time. In general, the intervals between these reviews are
constant and we talk about periodic review. Let
T = review period, i.e., the time interval between reviews.

3.2
Different Ordering Systems
41
Both alternatives have advantages as well as disadvantages. Continuous review will
reduce the needed safety stock. When using a continuous review system the inventory
position when ordering should guard against demand variations during the lead-
time L. With periodic review the uncertain time is instead T + L. Consider a review
when no order is triggered. The next possibility to order is T time units ahead, and
consequently, the time to the next possible delivery is T + L. Therefore, the inventory
position must guard against demand variations during this time.
Periodic review has advantages, especially when we want to coordinate orders for
different items (see Chap. 7). Although modern information technology has reduced
the costs for inspections considerably, periodic review will also reduce the costs for
the inventory control system. This is especially true for items with high demand. For
items with low demand it does not cost much more to use continuous review. The
advantages of continuous review are also usually larger for such items. In practice
it is therefore common to use continuous review for items with low demand, and
periodic review for items with higher demand.
Periodic review with a short review period T is, of course, very similar to
continuous review.
3.2.3
Different Ordering Policies
The two most common ordering policies in connection with inventory control are
often denoted (R, Q) policy and (s, S) policy.
3.2.3.1
(R, Q) Policy
When the inventory position declines to or below the reorder point R, a batch quantity
of size Q is ordered. (If the inventory position is sufﬁciently low it may be necessary
to order more than one batch to get above R. The considered policy is therefore
sometimes also denoted (R, nQ) policy.) If demand is continuous, or one unit at a
time, we will always hit the reorder point exactly in case of continuous review.
In case of periodic review, or if the triggering demand is for more than one unit,
it will often occur that the inventory position is below R when ordering. In this case
we will not reach the position R + Q after ordering. Fig. 3.1 illustrates this for a
periodic review (R, Q) policy. Note that the development of the inventory position is
completely independent of the lead-time L.
An ordering policy that is very similar to an (R, Q) policy is a so-called KANBAN
policy. With a KANBAN policy there are N containers, each containing Q units of
the item and with a card on the bottom. When a container becomes empty, the card
(a KANBAN) is used as an order for Q units. N – 1 of the KANBAN cards are
always associated with full containers, which are either in stock or ordered but not
yet delivered. So the inventory position is (N– 1)Q plus the number of units in the
container that at present is satisfying the demand. When this container is empty an

order is triggered.A KANBAN policy is consequently very similar to an (R, Q) policy
with R = (N– 1) Q. But if there are already N outstanding orders, i.e., no stock on
hand, no more orders can be triggered since no KANBANs are available. We can
therefore interpret a KANBAN policy as an (R, Q) policy where backorders are not
subtracted from the inventory position.
3.2.3.2
(s, S) Policy
This policy is also similar to an (R, Q) policy. The reorder point is denoted by s.
When the inventory position declines to or below s, we order up to the maximum
level S. The difference compared to an (R, Q) policy is consequently that we no
longer order multiples of a given batch quantity. If we always hit the reorder point
exactly (continuous review and continuous demand), the two policies are equivalent
provided s = R and S = R + Q. But if we do not always hit the reorder point exactly,
the equivalence does not hold. Figure 3.2 illustrates such a situation with periodic
review. Since we order when the inventory position is below the reorder point, we
would not have reached the inventory position R + Q after ordering in case of an
(R, Q) system. See Fig. 3.1.
In case of periodic review, it may happen with either policy that we do not reach
the reorder point at a certain inspection. In that case no order is triggered. A variation
of the (s, S) policy denoted S policy, or order-up-to-S policy, or base stock policy,
will always order unless the period demand is zero. An S policy simply means that
we order up to S independent of the inventory position. An S policy is equivalent
to an (s, S) policy with s = S −1 and to an (R, Q) policy with R = S −1 and Q = 1.
In case of continuous review, a single demand may similarly not trigger an order
when using an (R, Q) policy or an (s, S) policy. A policy which always immediately

orders the demanded number of units is also an S policy, but is in connection with
continuous review often denoted (S −1, S) policy.
For single-echelon systems, it is possible to show that the optimal policy, under
very general assumptions, is of the (s, S) type. See Sect. 6.2. From a theoretical point
of view it should therefore be advantageous to use (s, S) policies. However, the cost
differences are, in general, very small, and in practice it is often easier to use an
(R, Q) policy with a ﬁxed batch quantity.
Independent of which policy we choose, it remains to determine the control
parameters R and Q, or s and S. We shall deal with this problem in Chaps. 4–6.

Chapter 4
Single-Echelon Systems: Deterministic
Lot Sizing
When using an (R, Q) policy we need to determine the two parameters R and Q. We
shall ﬁrst consider the determination of the batch quantity Q. (When using an (s, S)
policy, Q essentially corresponds to S–s.) We shall in this chapter assume that the
future demand is deterministic and given. If the lead-time is constant, it does then
not affect the problem and we can therefore just as well assume that the lead-time
L = 0. The only difference in case of a positive lead-time is that we need to order L
time units earlier. See also the discussion in Sect. 4.1.3. (If the demand is stochastic,
we cannot disregard the lead-time.)
Deterministic demand may seem to be a very unrealistic assumption. In most
situations there are stochastic variations in demand. It turns out, though, that the
assumption of deterministic demand is in general very reasonable. First of all there
exist situations when a company is really facing deterministic demand. An example
is a company delivering according to a long-range contract. More important is that
it is also often feasible to use deterministic lot sizing in case of stochastic demand.
The determination of Q should, even in a stochastic case, essentially mean that we
balance ordering and holding costs. Although a larger Q will, in fact, reduce the
need for safety stock, this is of minor importance. A standard procedure in practice
is therefore to ﬁrst replace the stochastic demand by its mean and use a deterministic
model to determine Q. Given Q, a stochastic model is then used in a second step to
determine the reorder point R. Under relatively general assumptions it is possible to
show that this approximate procedure will give a cost increase compared to optimum
that is always lower than 11.8 % (See Axsäter 1996; Zheng 1992). In general, the
cost increase is much lower than that.

number of practical applications. It was ﬁrst derived by Harris (1913), but Wilson
(1934) is also recognized in connection with this model. It is fascinating to see that
the model has been around for more than a century. The simplest version is based on
the following assumptions:
•
Demand is constant and continuous.
•
Ordering and holding costs are constant over time.
•
The batch quantity does not need to be an integer.
•
The whole batch quantity is delivered at the same time.
•
No shortages are allowed.
We shall use the following notation:
h =
holding cost per unit and time unit,
A =
ordering or setup cost,
d =
demand per time unit,
Q =
batch quantity,
C =
costs per time unit.
Since no safety stock is needed and no shortages are allowed the inventory level will
vary over time as in Fig. 4.1, i.e., a batch is delivered exactly when the preceding
batch is ﬁnished.
The relevant costs are the costs that vary with the batch quantity Q, i.e., the holding
costs and the ordering costs. We obtain
C = Q
2 h + d
QA
(4.1)
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (4.1) represents the holding costs, which we obtain as the average
stock, Q/2, multiplied by the holding cost h. The average number of orders per time
unit is d/Q, and multiplying by the ordering cost A, we obtain the ordering costs per
time unit in the second term.
The cost function C is obviously convex in Q, and we can therefore obtain the
optimal Q from the ﬁrst order condition

(4.4)
i.e., for the optimal order quantity the holding costs happen to be exactly equal to
the ordering costs.
In Eq. (4.1) we have expressed the costs as a function of the order quantity Q. An
alternative is to express the costs in terms of the cycle time T = Q/d. Optimizing T,
we obviously obtain, T ∗= Q∗/d.

(4.5)
From Eq. (4.5) it is evident that the relative cost increase C/C∗when using the batch
quantity Q instead of the optimal Q∗is a simple function of Q/Q∗. It turns out that
even quite large deviations from the optimal order quantity will give very limited cost
increases. For example, if Q/Q∗= 3/2 (or 2/3) we get C/C∗= 1.08 from Eq. (4.5),
i.e., the cost increase is only 8 %. It is also interesting to note that the costs are even
less sensitive to errors in the cost parameters. For example, if we use a value of the
ordering cost A that is 50 % higher than the correct ordering cost, we can see from Eq.
(4.3) that the resulting relative error in the batch quantity is Q/Q∗= (3/2)1/2 = 1.225
and the relative cost increase is only about 2 %. Consequently, we can conclude that
the choice of cost parameters when using the classical economic order quantity is not
that critical. It should be noted, however, that other more complex situations exist
when even small errors in the batch quantities can affect the costs dramatically. We
shall discuss such situations in Chap. 7.
Example 4.1 Consider an item with unit cost $ 100, and holding cost rate per year
corresponding to 20 % of the value. The constant demand is 300 units per year.
The ordering cost is $ 200. We get h = 0.20 × 100 = $ 20 per year. A = $ 200 and
d = 300 per year.Applying (4.3) we obtain the optimal batch quantity Q∗(2Ad/h)1/2 =
(2 × 200 × 300/20)1/2 = 77.5 units.
In practice Q often has to be an integer. Because the cost function Eq. (4.1) is convex,
it is obvious that the best integral Q is either n or n + 1. We can see from Eq. (4.5) that

we should choose the lower value Q = n if n/ Q∗+Q∗/n≤(n+ 1)/Q∗+Q∗/(n+ 1),
or equivalently if Q∗/n ≤(n + 1)/Q∗. Note that it is, in general not optimal to simply
round Q∗to the closest integer.
4.1.3
Reorder Point
Assume now that we want to use a continuous review (R, Q) policy under the con-
sidered simple assumptions. The batch quantity Q is given and we want to choose
reorder point R so that we get the control in Fig. 4.1. How should we then choose
the reorder point R? If the lead-time L = 0 we simply choose R = 0. This means
that we order when the inventory position is equal to zero and we get the delivery
immediately. Note that when L = 0 the inventory position is always equal to the
inventory level. Assume then a lead-time L > 0. As we have pointed out above, we
only need to order the batch L time units earlier. This means that we need to change
the reorder point to R = Ld, i.e., we add the deterministic lead-time demand. Assume
for example, that this results in R = 2.5Q. An order is triggered when the inventory
position is equal to R, while the inventory level will never exceed Q. When an order
is triggered, there are two outstanding orders and the inventory level is equal to Q/2,
i.e., the inventory position is no longer equal to the inventory level.
4.2
Finite Production Rate
If there is a ﬁnite production rate the whole batch is not delivered at the same time. The
batch is instead delivered continuously with a certain production rate. It is common
and quite easy to modify the basic model in Sect. 4.1 to encompass such successive
deliveries. The inventory will now vary as in Fig. 4.2.

4.3

Let
p =
production rate (p > d).
In each cycle we produce during the time Q/p. Consider the ﬁrst cycle in Fig. 4.2.
During the time Q/p the stock is increasing at the rate p – d. The maximum level
is (Q/p)(p −d) = Q(1 – d/p). After the time Q/p the stock is decreasing with rate d
until the production starts again.
The only difference compared to the classical model Eq. (4.1) is that the average
inventory level is now Q(1 – d/p)/2 instead of Q/2 and we obtain:
C = Q(1 −d/p)

h + d

(4.6)
Setting the derivative with respect to Q equal to zero we get the optimal solution as
Q∗=

2Ad
h(1 −d/p)
(4.7)
It is easy to show that Eq. (4.5) is also valid in this case. Note furthermore that if
p →∞, Eq. (4.7) degenerates to the classical economic order quantity formula Eq.
(4.3).
4.3
Quantity Discounts
In general, it is relatively easy to include other costs that vary with the order quantity
in lot sizing models. We shall illustrate this by considering the simple model in
Sect. 4.1.1 with an additional assumption. If the order quantity is sufﬁciently large
we get an all-units discount on the purchase price. Let
v = price per unit for Q < Q0, i.e., the normal price,
v´ = price per unit for Q ≥Q0, where v´ < v.
Note that we assume that we get the whole order at the lower price if Q ≥Q0. It is
also possible to handle the case when there is a discount only for units above the
breakpoint Q0. See Benton and Park (1996).
The holding cost will depend on the unit cost and we assume that it has the
following structure:
h = h0 + rv
for Q < Q0,
h´ = h0 + rv´
for Q ≥Q0,

50

i.e., we assume that the holding costs consist of two parts, a capital cost obtained by
applying the interest rate r on the unit cost, and other out-of-pocket holding costs h0
independent of the price per unit. As before, A is the ordering cost and d the constant
demand per time unit.
Since the purchasing costs now depend on the order quantity they must be included
in the objective function used to determine Q. We obtain
C = dv + Q
2 (h0 + rv) + d
QA
for Q < Q0,
(4.8)
C = dv′ + Q
2 (h0 + rv′) + d
QA
for Q ≥Q0.
(4.9)
Figure 4.3 illustrates the resulting cost function.
We shall use two steps to get the optimal solution:
1. First we consider Eq. (4.9) without the constraint Q ≥Q0. We obtain
Q′ =

2Ad
h0 + rv′
(4.10)
and
C′ =

2Ad(h0 + rv′) + dv′
(4.11)
Note now that since v′ < v, Eq. (4.9) provides a lower bound for Eq. (4.8) with
Q < Q0. Therefore if Q′ ≥Q0, Eqs. (4.10) and (4.11) give the optimal solution,
i.e., Q∗= Q′, and C∗= C′.
2. If Q′ < Q0 as in Fig. 4.3 we need to optimize the cost function (4.8)
Q′′ =

2Ad
h0 + rv
(4.12)

4.4
Backorders Allowed
51
and
C′′ =

2Ad(h0 + rv) + dv
(4.13)
Since v > v′ we know that Q′′ is smaller than Q′ so we have Q′′ < Q′ < Q0.
Clearly, Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13) provide the lowest possible cost without a discount.
Because of the convexity of Eq. (4.9) and that Q′ < Q0, we know that the lowest
cost with a discount is
C(Q0) = dv′ + Q0
2 (h0 + rv′) + d
Q0
A
(4.14)
The optimal solution in this case is consequently obtained as the minimum of Eq.
(4.13) and (4.14).
Example 4.2 Assume that v = $ 100 and v′ = $ 95 for Q ≥Q0 = 100. Furthermore
h0 = $ 5 per unit and year, and r = 0.2, i.e., h = $ 25 and h′ = $ 24 per unit and year.
The constant demand is d = 300 per year, and the setup cost A = $ 200.
In the ﬁrst step we get Q′ = 70.71 and C′ = 30197 from Eqs. (4.10) and (4.11).
Since Q′ < Q0 we need to go to the second step. From Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13) we
get Q′′ = 69.28 and C′′ = 31732. Applying Eq. (4.14) we obtain C(100) = 30300.
Consequently Q∗= Q0 = 100 is the optimal order quantity.
4.4
Backorders Allowed
So far we have assumed that backorders are not allowed. Backorders can make sense
in a deterministic model, though. Therefore we shall now allow backorders and
introduce a certain penalty cost proportional to the waiting time for the customer.
b1 =
shortage penalty cost per unit and time unit.
Otherwise the assumptions are exactly the same as when we derived the classical
economic order quantity in Sect. 4.1.1.
The backorder penalty costs per time unit are b1 times the average number of
backorders, since each unit backordered during one time unit means that some cus-
tomer is waiting during that same time. Recall that the inventory level is the stock on
hand minus backorders. The backorder cost considered has a structure that is very
similar to the holding cost. The only difference is that the backorder cost is charged
when the inventory level is negative and the holding cost when it is positive. Note
that we can similarly interpret the holding cost h as a penalty cost per unit and time
unit for units waiting to be demanded. Each unit on hand is waiting for its demand to
occur. So the total of such penalty costs (holding costs) per unit of time are obtained
as h times the average inventory on hand. (There are other types of shortage costs,
as will be discussed in Sect. 5.5.)
Note also that because the average number of backorders equals the average
customer waiting time per unit of time, the average number of backorders divided

by the demand d is the average waiting time per unit demanded. This relationship is
valid in much more general stochastic settings and is then denoted Little’s formula.
See also Sect. 10.2. Similarly, the average inventory on hand divided by d is the
average waiting time for a unit to be demanded.
Allowing backorders means that some units are delivered in stock after they have
been demanded. Let us deﬁne
x =
fraction of demand that is backordered.
This means that when a batch Q is delivered the fraction x of the batch is used to
cover backorders that have occurred before the batch was delivered. We wish to
optimize both x and Q. The development of the inventory level is very similar to that
in Fig. 4.1. See Fig. 4.4.
The costs are now obtained as
C = Q(1 −x)2
2
h + Qx2
2 b1 + d
QA
(4.15)
In Eq. (4.15) we use that the ratio of time with positive stock is (1 – x) and with
backorders x. When the inventory level is positive, the average stock on hand is
Q(1 – x)/2, but when the inventory level is negative, the stock on hand is zero. So
we obtain the average stock on hand as (1 – x) Q(1 – x)/2 +x·0 = Q(1 – x)2/2. In
complete analogy the average number of backorders is Q x2/2.
The cost is convex in x, and it is easy to see that the optimal x is independent of
Q. By setting the derivative equal to zero we obtain
x∗=
h
h + b1
(4.16)
and inserting in Eq. (4.15) we get

(4.18)
C∗=

(4.19)
Note that the batch quantity Eq. (4.18) is larger and the optimal costs Eq. (4.19) are
lower than the corresponding batch quantity and costs for the classical economic
order quantity model Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4). The costs are lower because we have more
ﬂexibility when allowing backorders. We get the cost function Eq. (4.1) if we force
x to be zero.
It is easy to check that Eq. (4.5) is still valid. Note also that the solution will
approach that of the classical economic lot size problem as b1 →∞.
Example 4.3
Consider the same data as in Example 4.1 with the additional as-
sumption that backorders are allowed with a backorder cost b1 = $ 100 per unit
and year. The constant demand is d = 300 units per year. The ordering cost is
A = $ 200 and the holding cost h = $ 20 per unit and year. Applying Eq. (4.16)
we get x∗= 20/120 = 1/6 and from Eq. (4.18) we get the optimal batch quantity
Q∗= (2 × 200 × 300 × 120/2000)1/2 / 84.85 units.
4.5
Time-Varying Demand
Sofarwehaveonlyconsideredconstantdemand. Time-varyingdeterministicdemand
is also quite common, though. The variations can depend on different reasons. For
example, an item may be used as a component when producing some product that
is only produced on certain known occasions. Another possibility is production on a
contract, which requires that certain quantities are delivered on speciﬁed dates. There
can also be known seasonal variations in demand. Recall that we are still considering
deterministic demand, i.e., all variations are known in advance. We can therefore still
disregard the lead-time.
When dealing with lot sizing for time-varying demand, it is generally assumed
that there are a ﬁnite number of discrete time steps, or periods. A period may be, for
example, 1 day or a week. We know the demand in each period, and for simplicity, it
is assumed that the period demand takes place at the beginning of the period. There
is no initial stock. When delivering a batch, the whole batch is delivered at the same
time. The holding cost and the ordering cost are constant over time. No backorders
are allowed. We shall use the following notation:

54
4
Single-Echelon Systems: Deterministic Lot Sizing
T =
number of periods,
di =
demand in period i, i = 1, 2,. . . , T, (it is assumed that d1 > 0, since otherwise
we can just disregard period 1),
A =
ordering cost,
h =
holding cost per unit and time unit.
We wish to choose batch quantities so that the sum of the ordering and holding costs
is minimized. The problem considered is usually denoted the classical dynamic lot
size problem. Since the demand is varying over time, we can no longer expect the
optimal lot sizes to be constant.
Example 4.4
Let T = 4, d1 = 10, d2 = 20, d3 = 10, d4 = 30, h = 2, and A = 150.
Consider the batch that should be delivered at the beginning of period 1. (Note
that we always need a delivery in period 1.) It is important to realize that only a few
values of the batch size are possible in an optimal solution. For example, a ﬁrst batch
size of 35 units can be disregarded. This batch size would cover the ﬁrst two periods
and half of the demand in period 3. But since a new batch is needed anyway in period
3, it would in that case be advantageous to add 5 units to the second batch and reduce
the ﬁrst batch to 30. By doing so we can reduce the stock in periods 1 and 2 by 5
units, and this means, of course, lower holding costs. We can conclude that a batch
should always cover the demand in an integer number of periods. Consequently, the
ﬁrst batch can only be 10, 30, 40, or 70. But in this example we can also rule out
batch size 70, since this batch size implies that the demand in period 4 is stocked
during periods 1–3, incurring the holding costs 3 · 2 · 30 = 180. This means that it
is cheaper to cover the demand in period 4 by a separate delivery that will incur the
ordering cost 150 but eliminate the considered holding costs.
Let us summarize the conclusions from Example 4.4 as two properties of the optimal
solution:
Property 1
A replenishment must always cover the demand in an integer number
of consecutive periods.
Property 2
The holding costs for a period demand should never exceed the ordering
cost.
Property 1 is often denoted the zero-inventory property, meaning that a delivery
should only take place when the inventory is zero. It can be shown that Property 1 is
valid in a more general setting, see e.g., Problem 4.15. A consequence of Property 1
is that the optimal solution has a relatively simple structure.
Wewillonlydealwiththecasewhenbackordersarenotallowed. Itisalsocommon
to consider a more general version of the problem with backorders.
4.6
The Wagner-Whitin Algorithm
The dynamic lot size problem described in Sect. 4.5 is relatively easy to solve ex-
actly. The most common approach is to use Dynamic Programming. This was ﬁrst
suggested by Wagner and Whitin (1958) and their solution is usually denoted the
Wagner-Whitin algorithm.

4.6
The Wagner-Whitin Algorithm
55
Let us introduce the following notation:
fk
=
minimum costs over periods 1, 2,..., k, i.e., when we disregard periods k + 1,
k + 2, ...,T,
fk,t =
minimum costs over periods 1, 2,..., k, given that the last delivery is in
period t(1 ≤t ≤k).
Note ﬁrst that
fk = min
1≤t≤kfk,t,
(4.20)
since the last delivery must occur in some period in the optimal solution. It is also
obvious that f0 = 0 and that f1 = f1,1 =A. This is so because with just one period
we get a setup cost but no holding costs. Recall that the period demand is assumed
to occur at the beginning of a period.
Assume now that we know ft−1 for some t > 0. It is then easy to obtain fk, t for
k ≥t as
fk,t = ft−1 + A + h(dt+1 + 2dt+2 + . . . + (k −t)dk).
(4.21)
Because we have a delivery in period t, the minimum costs for periods 1, 2, . . . , t – 1
must be ft−1. The cost in period t is the setup cost A. Recall again that the demands
are assumed to take place at the beginning of the periods. This means that dt will not
cause any holding costs. The demand in period t + 1 incurs the holding costs hdt + 1
since the quantity dt + 1 is kept in stock during period t. The demand in period t + 2
is similarly kept in stock during two periods, t and t + 1, and incurs the holding costs
2hdt + 2, etc.
Assume now that we know f1, f2,. . . , fk −1 , i.e., that we have solved the problem
for 1, 2,. . . , k–1 periods. We can then determine fk, t for 1 ≤t ≤k from (4.21). Next
we apply (4.20) to get fk and the problem is also solved for k periods. After that
we are ready to use the same procedure for k + 1 periods, etc. From Property 2 in
Sect. 4.5 we know that if h(j – t)dj >A we do not need to determine fk, t for k ≥j
when applying (4.21). Furthermore, it is obvious that we only need to consider k ≤T.
After going through all T periods we obtain the optimal solution as follows. First
we consider Eq. (4.20) for k =T. The minimum value is the optimal cost, and the
minimizing t is the period with the last delivery. Denote the minimizing t by t′. Since
the last delivery is in period t′, the solution for periods 1, 2,. . . , t′ −1 must also
be optimal. So we can again consider Eq. (4.20) for k = t′ −1. The optimal last
delivery for this problem, say t′′, is the second last delivery for the total problem.
Next we consider Eq. (4.20) for k = t′′ −1, and we continue in this way until the
minimizing t equals one, since we have then obtained all periods with deliveries.
We shall illustrate the computations with an example.
Example 4.5
The demands in T = 10 periods are given in the ﬁrst two rows of
Table 4.1. The ordering cost is A = $ 300 and the holding cost h = $ 1 per unit and
period.

In Table 4.1 we start by setting f1,1 = 300. Next we use Eq. (4.21) to determine
f2,1 = f1,1 + 1 · 60 = 360, f3,1 = f2,1 + 2 × 90 = 540, etc. When we come to f6,1
we note that the holding cost associated with the demand in period 6 is 500 >A = 300
and the column is therefore complete due to Property 2. It is clear that f1 = f1,1 = 300.
Applying Eq. (4.21) we obtain f2,2, f3,2, etc. After completing this column we apply
Eq. (4.20) to get f2 = min {f2,1, f2,2} = min {360, 600} = 360. After completing
the next column we have to optimize over the next diagonal to the right to get
f3 = min{540, 690, 660} = 540. We continue in this way until the table is complete.
We get the minimum costs f10 = min {1550, 1630, 1570, 1550, 1770} = 1550 by
applying Eq. (4.20). It is obvious that the minimum costs are obtained both for t′ = 9
and t′ = 6. Let us ﬁrst consider the solution with t′ = 9. Since the last delivery is in
period 9, the problem over 8 periods must also be solved optimally. By looking in the
corresponding diagonal we get t′′ = 6. Next we consider the ﬁve period problem and
obtain t′′′ = 3. Finally we get t′′′′ = 1 and the solution is complete. It is easy to verify
that the other optimal solution with t′ = 6 simply means that the last two batches are
combined into a single batch. The two optimal solutions are given in Table 4.2.
The Wagner-Whitin algorithm was generalized to the backlogging case by
Zangwill (1966).
Consider Table 4.1. There are T columns. Furthermore, there may also be as much
as T cells in a column. This means that the computational complexity is O(T 2), i.e.,
the computation time may be proportional to T 2. Recent more efﬁcient methods
for solving the dynamic lot size problem are given in Federgruen and Tzur (1991,
1994, 1995) and Wagelmans et al. (1992). The computational complexity of these
techniques is O(TLog(T)).

4.7
The Silver-Meal Heuristic
57
In practice it is very common to consider dynamic lot size problems in a rolling
horizon environment. In each period we want to determine the lot sizes in the ﬁrst
period. The real horizon is inﬁnite but we consider a ﬁnite horizon as an approxima-
tion. The question then arises whether it is possible to replace an inﬁnite horizon by
a sufﬁciently long ﬁnite horizon, such that we still get the optimal solution in the ﬁrst
period. Several such planning horizon results have been derived. See e.g., Wagner
and Whitin (1958), Kunreuther and Morton (1973), Lundin and Morton (1975), and
Federgruen and Tzur (1994, 1995). Such planning horizons are generally quite long,
though. It may even happen that no planning horizon exists. The following example
from Bhaskaran and Sethi (1988) illustrates this. See also Sect. 4.9.
Example 4.6
The demands over an inﬁnite horizon are given as d1 = 5, d2 =
4, d3 = 5, d4 = 4, and di = 5, for i ≥5. Furthermore, A = 1 and h = 0.05. Let T
be a considered ﬁnite horizon. It can be shown that the optimal initial batch varies
as follows: for T = 3, 6, 9, 12, . . . it is 14, for T = 4, 7, 10, 13, . . . it is 18, and for
T = 5, 8, 11, 14, . . . it is 9. So if we increase or decrease the horizon T by one time
unit the initial batch is changing.
4.7
The Silver-Meal Heuristic
Although the Wagner- Whitin algorithm and other exact methods are in most circum-
stances computationally feasible, in practice it is much more common to use simple
heuristics to obtain an approximate solution. One of the best and most well-known
methods is the Silver-Meal heuristic (Silver and Meal 1973).
The Silver- Meal heuristic is, like most other lot sizing heuristics, a sequential
method. When determining the delivery in period 1 we consider successively the
demands in periods 2, 3, . . . (Recall that we know that the delivery batch in period
1 must at least cover the demand in period 1). When considering period 2 we use
a simple test to decide whether this period demand should be added to the delivery
batch in the ﬁrst period. If this is the case we continue with period 3, etc. Assume
that this procedure shows that the next delivery will come in period k. The procedure
is then repeated with period k as the “ﬁrst period”.
The idea of the Silver- Meal heuristic is to choose to have a new delivery when the
average per period costs increase for the ﬁrst time. This means that the ﬁrst delivery
shall cover n periods and the next delivery take place in period n + 1 if

Example 4.7 We consider the same problem as in Example 4.5, i.e., A = $ 300 and
h = $ 1 per unit and period. The demands are given in Table 4.3.
If the delivery in period 1 covers only the demand in period 1 the cost for this
period is the ordering cost A = 300. We now successively consider the per period
costs for deliveries that cover 2, 3,. . . periods.
2 periods (300 + 60)/2 = 180 < 300,
3 periods (300 + 60 + 2 × 90)/3 = 180 ≤180,
4 periods (300 + 60 + 2 × 90 + 3 × 70)/4 = 187.5 > 180, which means a new
delivery in period 4.
The same procedure is now applied with period 4 as the ﬁrst period.
2 periods (300 + 30)/2 = 165 < 300,
3 periods (300 + 30 + 2 × 100)/3 = 176.67 > 165, which means a new delivery
in period 6.
Starting with period 6 as the ﬁrst period we obtain
2 periods (300 + 60)/2 = 180 < 300,
3 periods (300 + 60 + 2 × 40)/3 = 146.67 ≤180,
4 periods (300 + 60 + 2 × 40 + 3 × 80)/4 = 170 > 146.67, which means a new
delivery in period 9.
Starting with period 9 as the ﬁrst period we obtain
2 periods (300 + 20)/2 = 160 < 300.
The corresponding solution is given in Table 4.4.
ThetotalcostsareobtainedasC = 3 × 180 + 2 × 165 + 3 × 146.67 + 2 × 160
= 1630 (3 periods with average period cost 180, 2 periods with average period cost
165, etc.). This is about 5 % higher than the optimal costs obtained by the Wagner-
Whitin algorithm. Note that in this case we are very close to obtaining the optimal
solution. If, for example, the demand in period 3 had been 91 instead of 90, the
heuristic would have suggested a delivery in period 3 and we would have obtained
the optimal solution.
In most situations the cost increase is only about 1–2 %, see e.g., Baker (1989).
Still it has been demonstrated that the relative error can be arbitrarily large, see
Axsäter (1982, 1985). It is straightforward to extend the logic of the procedure to
more general problems, e.g., to include discounts.
When using the Silver-Meal heuristic we consider the costs per period. An alter-
native is to consider the costs per unit. This means that we are dividing by the total

number of units instead of the number of periods in our comparisons. This alterna-
tive procedure is denoted the Least Unit Cost heuristic. It has been shown that the
Silver-Meal heuristic, in general, outperforms the Least Unit Cost heuristic (Baker,
1989).
4.8
A Heuristic that Balances Holding and Ordering Costs
When we derived the classical economic order quantity formula in Sect. 4.1.1 it
turned out that in the optimal solution, holding costs and ordering costs are exactly
equal. This is no longer true for the dynamic lot size problem, but it is reasonable to
expect that holding and ordering costs are of about the same size. This is the basis
for the following algorithm, which is a simpliﬁed version of a technique suggested
by De Matteis and Mendoza (1968) .
Let the ﬁrst delivery quantity cover n periods, where n is determined by the
condition
h
n

j=2
(j −1)dj ≤A < h
n+1

j=2
(j −1)dj,
(4.24)
i.e., we choose to have a new delivery as soon as the holding costs exceed the ordering
cost. As with the Silver-Meal heuristic, the next batch is determined in the same way
with period n + 1 regarded as the ﬁrst period.
In general this heuristic does not perform as well as the Silver-Meal heuristic. The
relative error cannot be arbitrarily large, though. It is bounded by 100 %, seeAxsäter
(1982, 1985).
Example 4.8 We consider again the same problem setting as in Examples 4.5 and
4.7, i.e., A = $ 300 and h = $ 1 per unit and period. The demands are given in
Table 4.3.
Starting with period 2 we compare the accumulated holding costs to the ordering
cost.
2 periods 60 ≤300,
3 periods 60 + 2 × 90 = 240 ≤300,
4 periods 60 + 2 × 90 + 3 × 70 = 450 > 300, which means a new delivery in
period 4.
The same procedure is now applied with period 4 as the ﬁrst period.
2 periods 30 ≤300,
3 periods 30 + 2 × 100 = 230 ≤300,
4 periods 30 + 2 × 100 + 3 × 60 = 410 > 300, which means a new delivery in
period 7.
Starting with period 7 as the ﬁrst period we obtain
2 periods 40 ≤300,
3 periods 40 + 2 × 80 = 200 ≤300,
4 periods 40 + 2 × 80 + 3 × 20 = 260 ≤300.

The solution is given in Table 4.5. It is easy to verify that we get the same costs
as with the Silver-Meal heuristic, i.e., 1630. Of course, this might not always be the
case.
Other lot sizing heuristics are suggested in e.g., Groff (1979) and Axsäter (1980).
4.9
Exact or Approximate Solution
We have considered three methods for solving the classical dynamic lot size problem.
The Wagner-Whitin algorithm gives the optimal solution while the other techniques
are approximate. An exact solution is by no means computationally infeasible. Still
it is much more common in practice to use an approximate method. One reason is
that the approximate methods are easy to understand. It is also easy to check the
computations manually. However, there is also another, probably even more impor-
tant reason. As we have discussed in Sect. 4.6, the considered lot sizing techniques
are usually applied in a rolling horizon environment. In each period we want to de-
termine lot sizes for the ﬁrst period. The real inﬁnite horizon is then replaced by a
ﬁnite horizon. If this ﬁnite horizon were sufﬁciently long we would often still get the
optimal solution for the ﬁrst period. But in practice it is common to use a relatively
short horizon. This means that the solution is also approximate when using an exact
method like the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. The approximate methods are, in general,
not similarly sensitive with respect to the length of the horizon. In such situations
a good approximate method may therefore even outperform an exact method (see
Blackburn and Millen 1980).

Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
5.1
Discrete Stochastic Demand
We shall now consider different techniques for determining reorder points, or equiv-
alently safety stocks, when the demand is a stationary stochastic process. To do this
we ﬁrst of all need a suitable demand model. In practice the demand during a certain
time is nearly always a nonnegative integer, i.e., it is a discrete stochastic variable.
(Exceptions may occur when we deal with products like oil.) Provided that the de-
mand is reasonably low, it is then natural to use a discrete demand model, which
resembles the real demand. However, if the demand is relatively large, it may be more
practical to use a continuous demand model as an approximation. See Sect. 5.2. As
before it is assumed that individual items can be controlled separately.
5.1.1
Compound Poisson Demand
A common assumption in stochastic inventory models is that the cumulative demand
can be modeled by a nondecreasing stochastic process with stationary and mutually
independent increments. Such a process may always be represented as a limit of
an appropriate sequence of compound Poisson processes. See, for example, Feller
(1966). We shall therefore often make the assumption that the demand is a compound
Poisson process. This means that the customers arrive according to a Poisson process
with given intensity λ. The size of a customer demand is also a stochastic variable.
In a small time interval Δt the probability for exactly one customer is λΔt, while
the probability for more than one customer can be disregarded, or in other words it
is o(Δt). The number of customers in a time interval of length t then has a Poisson
distribution and the probability for k customers is
P(k) = (λt)k
k! e−λt,
k = 0, 1, 2, ....
(5.1)
Both the average and the variance of the number of customers are equal to λt.

Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
Compound Poisson demand means that the size of a customer demand is also a
stochastic variable that is independent of other customer demands and of the distri-
bution of the customer arrivals. The distribution of the demand size is denoted the
compounding distribution. It is convenient to assume that each customer demands
an integral number of units. Let
fj = probability of demand size j ( j = 1, 2 . . .)
If f1 = 1, the demand process degenerates to pure Poisson demand. The demand is
then equal to the number of customers and the demand distribution is given by (5.1).
Let us now consider the general case where the demand sizes are varying. Note
that we assume that there are no demands of size zero. This is no lack of generality. If
f0 > 0, we can replace the demand process by an equivalent process characterized
by λ′ and f ′
j where λ′ = λ(1 −f0), f ′
0 = 0, and f ′
j = fj/(1 −f0) for j > 0. We
shall also assume that not all demands are multiples of some integer larger than one.
This is, for example, always the case when f1 > 0. Assume that this condition is
not satisﬁed and that the demand size is, for example, always a multiple of ﬁve. It is
then natural to switch to a new unit that consists of ﬁve old units. With the new unit
the condition is satisﬁed.
Let
f k
j
=
probability that k customers give the total demand j
D (t) =
stochastic demand in the time interval t
We can determine the distribution of D(t) as follows. Note ﬁrst that f 0
0 = 1, and
f 1
j = fj. Given f 1
j we can obtain the j-fold convolution of fj, f k
j , recursively as
f k
j =

i=k−1

k = 2, 3, 4, ....
(5.2)
Example 5.1 Given f 1

2 = f2 = 0.4 we get the probabilities
for the demands from two customers as (Only non-zero terms are included.)

(5.3)
Let us now determine simple expressions for the average and the standard deviation
of the demand during one unit of time. Of course, we can also get the average and
the standard deviation from the distribution obtained in (5.3).

5.1
Discrete Stochastic Demand
67
μ = average demand per unit of time
σ = standard deviation of the demand per unit of time
Consider one time unit. Let K be the stochastic number of customers during this time
unit, J the stochastic demand size of a single customer, and Z the stochastic demand
during the time unit considered. Recall that E(K) =Var(K) =λ and that K and J are
independent. For a given K, Z is simply the sum of K independent customer demands
and we have
μ = E(Z) = E
K{E(Z |K)} = E
K{KE(J)} = E(K)E(J) = λ

To determine σ we ﬁrst obtain
E(Z2) = E
K{E(Z2 |K )} = E
K{Var(Z |K ) + (E(Z |K ))2}
= E
K{KVar(J) + K2(E(J))2}.
(5.5)
Using E(K2) = Var(K) + (E(K))2 = λ + λ2, we can now determine σ 2 =Var(Z)
as
σ 2 = E(Z2) −μ2 = E
K{KV ar(J) + K2(E(J))2} −μ2


j=1

(5.6)
Equations (5.4) and (5.6) give the mean and standard deviation of the demand during
one unit of time. Let μ′ and σ ′ be the mean and standard deviation of the demand
during the time t. We then simply have μ′ = μt and (σ ′)2 = σ 2t.
From (5.4) and (5.6) we note that σ 2/μ = E(J2)/E(J) ≥1 with equality only for
pure Poisson demand. Consequently, it is not possible to model demand processes
with σ 2/μ < 1 as compound Poisson demand.
We shall use the compound Poisson process when deriving various theoretical
results. For items with relatively low demand, it may also be advantageous to use
this demand model in practice. An advantage with compound Poisson demand is that
it is easy to represent the demand in a simulation model.
In connection with inventory control we usually need the distribution of the de-
mand over a certain time t (e.g., the lead-time). In general we have estimates of μ′
and σ ′ from the forecasting system (see Chap. 2). The standard procedure is then to
ﬁt the selected demand model to these two parameters.

5.1.2
Logarithmic Compounding Distribution
Let us ﬁrst assume that the demand size has a logarithmic distribution. This means
that
fj = −
αj
ln (1 −α)j
j = 1, 2, 3, ...
(5.7)
where 0 < α < 1. This distribution has the following mean and variance
E(J) = −
α
(1 −α) ln (1 −α),
(5.8)
Var(J) = −
α( ln (1 −α) + α)
(1 −α)2( ln (1 −α))2 .
(5.9)
Note that this gives
E(J 2) = Var(J) + (E(J))2 = −
α
(1 −α)2 ln (1 −α).
(5.10)
When α →0 the demand size J will approach constant unit demand, i.e., f1 →1
and all other fj →0. When α →1Var(J)/E(J) →∞.
Let now μ′ and σ ′ be given. From (5.4) and (5.8) we get
μ′ = λtE(J) = −
λtα
(1 −α) ln (1 −α),
(5.11)
and from (5.6) and (5.10)
(σ ′)2 = λtE(J 2) = −
λtα
(1 −α)2 ln (1 −α).
(5.12)
It follows immediately from (5.11) and (5.12) that, for given μ′ and σ ′, we can
determine α and λ as
α = 1 −
μ′
(σ ′)2 = 1 −μ
σ 2 ,
(5.13)
λ = −μ′ (1 −α) ln (1 −α)
tα
= −μ(1 −α) ln (1 −α)
α
.
(5.14)
Using (5.2) and (5.3) we can then determine the distribution of the demand D(t)
during the time t. However, when the compounding distribution is logarithmic there
is a much simpler way. It is possible to show that in this case D(t) has a negative
binomial distribution, i.e., P(D(t) = 0) = (1 −p)r, and
P (D(t) = k) = r(r + 1)...(r + k −1)
k!
(1 −p)rpk,
k = 1,2, ...
(5.15)

Discrete Stochastic Demand

where the parameter r can be any positive number and 0 < p < 1. In the special case
when r is an integer, we can interpret the distribution as the sum of r independent
random variables each having a geometric distribution (see below). The negative
binomial distribution has E(D(t)) = rp/(1 −p) andVar(D(t)) = rp/(1 −p)2. So given
μ′ and σ ′, we can directly determine p and r as
p = 1 −
μ′
(σ ′)2 = α,
(5.16)
r = μ′ (1 −p)
p
.
(5.17)
It is then easy to apply (5.15).
The computational procedure we have described is both simple and efﬁcient.
5.1.3
Geometric Compounding Distribution
We shall also, as an alternative, consider a geometric compounding distribution.
Assume then that the compounding distribution is instead a delayed geometric
distribution, i.e.,
fj = (1 −β)βj−1,
j = 1,2, 3, ...
(5.18)
where 0 < β < 1. The resulting process is sometimes denoted a stuttering Poisson
process. The geometric distribution has the following mean and variance
E(J) =
1
1 −β ,
(5.19)
Var(J) =
β
(1 −β)2 .
(5.20)
Given μ and σ, we can use (5.4) and (5.6) to determine β and λ as
β = 1 −
2
1 + (σ)2/μ,
(5.21)
λ = μ(1 −β).
(5.22)
To see this use (5.19) and (5.20).
Finally, we can apply (5.2) and (5.3) to get the distribution of the demand over
the time t. It is, in general, easier to use a logarithmic compounding distribution and
apply (5.15)–(5.17).

Fig. 5.1 Comparison of logarithmic and geometric compounding distribution for the data in
Example 5.2
Example 5.2 Assume that μ′ = 5, (σ ′)2 = 15 and that the considered time is t = 20.
Let us ﬁrst use a logarithmic compounding distribution. Using (5.16) and (5.17) we
get p = 0.667 and r = 2.5. The corresponding distribution of the demand during t is
then easily obtained from (5.15). See Fig. 5.1. We can also determine α = p = 0.667,
and λ = 0.137 from (5.14). The average demand size is E(J) = 1.82 from (5.8).
Consider now instead a geometric compounding distribution. Using (5.21) and
(5.22) we get β = 0.5 and λ = 0.125. The average demand size is E(J) = 2 from
(5.19). Finally we apply (5.2) and (5.3) to get the distribution of the demand during
t, see Fig. 5.1.
It is obvious that the two obtained distributions are very similar. In practice the
shape of the distribution is normally unknown. Furthermore, μ′ and σ ′ are uncertain
estimates. Given this, it seems better to use a logarithmic compounding distribution
to simplify the computations.
5.1.4
Smooth Demand
If we use compound Poisson demand as our demand model, the total demand during a
certain time must have a variance-to-mean ratio larger or equal to one, see Sect. 5.1.1.
In some situations we want to model a smoother demand. Note, however, that this
means that the cumulative demand can no longer be interpreted as a non-decreasing
stochastic process with stationary and mutually independent increments. Further-
more, as long as we are dealing with a discrete random variable, for a given mean
there is always a lower bound for the possible variance. See, Adan et al. (1995) for
details. They suggest the following technique that can be used for variance-to-mean
ratios that are smaller than one.

5.1
Discrete Stochastic Demand
71
Let BIN(k, p) be a binomially distributed random variable, where the integer k is
the number of trials and p is the success probability, i.e.,
P(BIN(k, p) = j) =
⎛
⎝k
j
⎞
⎠pj(1 −p)k−j.
(5.23)
The binomial distribution has mean kp and variance kp(1 −p).
Assume now as before that μ′ and σ ′ are given. Determine
a =
σ ′
μ′
2
−1
μ′ .
(5.24)
Assume also that −1 ≤a < 0, otherwise the considered technique cannot be used.
Note that (σ ′)2/μ′ < 1 implies a < 0.
In the special case when a = −1, use BIN(1, μ′) as the demand distribution. (It
can be shown that μ′ < 1 in this case.) If a < −1, it may also be reasonable to use
this distribution as an approximation.
Otherwise determine k such that −1/k < a ≤1/(k + 1), i.e., k ≥1. The demand
distribution is then obtained as the mixture of two random variables, BIN(k, p) with
probability q and BIN(k + 1, p) with probability 1−q. The probabilities q and p are
obtained as
q = 1 + a(1 + k) + √−ak(1 + k) −k
1 + a
,
(5.25)
p =
μ′
k + 1 −q .
(5.26)
It can be shown that q and p are always between 0 and 1. We note that k →∞as
a →0 and this means that the computational effort will increase. Adan et al. (1995)
consider also other demand distributions.
5.1.5
Fitting Discrete Demand Distributions in Practice
In practice it is very convenient and computationally efﬁcient to use the Poisson
distribution (5.1), so this is a reasonable choice as long as (σ ′)2/μ′ ≈1. A suitable
decision rule is to use the Poisson distribution for e.g., 0.9 ≤(σ ′)2/μ′ ≤1.1. For
(σ ′)2/μ′ > 1.1 it is efﬁcient to use the negative binomial distribution, or in other
words, compound Poisson demand with a logarithmic compounding distribution,
see Sect. 5.1.2. For (σ ′)2/μ′ < 0.9 it is quite common to use Poisson demand, even
though this means that the variance is overestimated, but an alternative is to use a
mixture of binomial distributions as described in Sect. 5.1.4.

5.2
Continuous Stochastic Demand
5.2.1
Normally Distributed Demand
For items with higher demand, it is usually more convenient and efﬁcient to model
the demand over a time period by a continuous distribution. For many reasons it is
most common to use the normal distribution. We know from the central limit theorem
that, under very general conditions, a sum of many independent random variables
will have a distribution that is approximately normal. In many situations the demand
comes from several independent customers, so it reasonable to let the demand be
represented by a normal distribution. Furthermore, if the time period considered is
long enough, the discrete demand from a compound Poisson process will become
approximately normally distributed. The normal distribution has also for a long time
been common in practice and is easy to deal with.
A problem with the normal distribution is that there is always at least a small
probability for negative demand. Some results which are exact for compound Poisson
demand are therefore only approximately true for normal demand. See Browne and
Zipkin (1991) for a detailed discussion of various assumptions concerning demand
distributions.
Given the mean μ′ and standard deviation σ ′ of the demand during a time period
t, we can always ﬁt a unique normal distribution to these parameters. The so-called
standardized normal distribution with mean μ′ = 0 and standard deviation σ ′ = 1 has
the density

are tabulated in Appendix 2. For other values of μ′ and σ ′, we obtain the density as

closed form for the distribution function, but it is still easily available. One possibility
is to use tabulated values and interpolation.Another alternative is to use very accurate
approximations, see e.g., Abramowitz and Stegun (1964).
5.2.2
Gamma Distributed Demand
If the ratio σ ′/μ′ is not considerably less than 1, there is a relatively high probability
for negative demand when using the normal distribution. Although the normal dis-
tribution usually works quite well also in such cases, it may be more attractive to use

some other distribution for which the demand is always nonnegative. An alternative
is to use the so-called gamma distribution.
The gamma distribution has the density

In the special case when r is an integer (r) = (r−1)!, and we get a so-called Erlang
distribution i.e., the sum of r independent exponentially distributed random variables
with parameter λ. For any r > 1, (r) = (r −1)(r −1).
The gamma distribution has mean r/λ and variance r/λ2. Given μ′ and σ ′ it is
therefore always easy to determine the corresponding unique parameters r and λ as
r = (μ′/σ ′)2,
(5.31)
λ = μ′/(σ ′)2.
(5.32)
The distribution function cannot be expressed in closed form, but is together with
the density available in various software packages, e.g., in Excel.
Example 5.3 Let μ′ = 25 and σ ′ = 10. From (5.31) and (5.32) we get r = 6.25 and
λ = 0.25. In Fig. 5.2 gamma distributed demand is compared with normal demand.
Using the gamma distribution, the demand is always positive. Another difference
is that the probability for very high demand is larger with the gamma distribution.
Other possible continuous demand distributions are, for example, the lognormal
distribution, the Weibull distribution, and mixtures of Erlang distributions. All these
distributions can be ﬁtted to positive random variables with given mean and standard
deviation. See Tijms (1994) for details.

Continuous Review (R, Q) Policy—Inventory Level
Distribution
5.3.1
Distribution of the Inventory Position
Consider now an inventory system with discrete compound Poisson demand, which
is controlled by a continuous review (R, Q) policy. We shall derive some important
results for such a system. Let
IP = inventory position
When using an (R, Q) policy, an order is triggered as soon as the integer IP is at or
below the reorder point R. The order is for Q units if this is enough to bring IP above
R. If not, the order is for the smallest number of batches needed to make the inventory
position larger than R. Since an order is triggered as soon as the inventory position
is less than or equal to R, we always have IP ≥R + 1. Initially the inventory position
may be arbitrarily large, but as soon as we have ordered at least once we must have IP
≤R + Q. This is so because we always order the smallest number of batches needed
to make IP ≥R + 1. In steady state we must therefore have R + 1 ≤IP ≤R + Q. We
shall now prove the following interesting proposition.
Proposition 5.1 In steady state the inventory position is uniformly distributed on
the integers R + 1, R + 2,. . . , R + Q.
Proof
Recall that we assume that not all demands are multiples of some integer
larger than one. Therefore it is evident that, in the long run, we must reach all the
considered inventory positions.
Assume that the inventory position is R + i at some time. Each time a customer
arrives, IP will jump to some other value (or possibly to the same value if the size
of the demand is a multiple of Q). Let us denote the probability for a jump from
R + i to R + j by pi, j. It is evident that these probabilities can be determined from
the distribution of the demand size. It is also evident that we can see the jumps as a
Markov chain. Since all states can be reached, the chain is irreducible. In the special
case of pure Poisson demand the chain is periodic, otherwise ergodic. We shall
consider the ergodic case. (It is more or less directly evident that the Proposition
is also true for Poisson demand.) Because the chain is irreducible and ergodic, it
has a unique steady-state distribution. Consequently, we only need to prove that
the uniform distribution is a steady-state distribution, i.e., that if the distribution is
uniform at some time it is also uniform after the next (unknown) demand. So we
need to show that
Q

i=1
1
Qpi,j = 1
Q, j = 1,2, ..., Q,
(5.33)
or equivalently that Q
i=1 pi,j = 1 for all values of j. When this equality is satisﬁed
the chain is said to be doubly stochastic. (Recall that the equality Q
j=1 pi,j = 1 is
always true for a Markov chain.)

5.3
Continuous Review (R, Q) Policy—Inventory Level Distribution
75
Let the state be i and consider a certain demand size k. Given k, the next state is
known i.e., pi, j(k) is equal to one for a certain j and zero otherwise. Furthermore, it is
similarly evident that for a given j, pi, j(k) is one for exactly one value of i. If we know
the new state and the demand size, we also know the preceding state. Consequently,
Q
i=1 pi,j(k) = 1. The probability pi, j can be expressed as the average of pi, j(k) over
k, i.e., pi, j =Ek pi, j(k). We now have

(5.34)
This completes the proof.
When dealing with normally distributed demand, we similarly assume that the
continuous inventory position is uniformly distributed on the interval [R, R + Q].This
is a very accurate approximation provided that we can disregard the possibilities for
negative demand.
5.3.2
An Important Relationship
We shall assume that the replenishment lead-time is constant. Let us introduce the
notation:
L
= lead-time
IL
= inventory level
D(t, t + τ) = D(τ) = stochastic demand in the interval (t, t + τ)
Consider an arbitrary time t when the system is in steady state. Let IP(t) be the
inventory position at that time. Consider then the time t + L. At that time everything
that was on order at time t has been delivered. Orders that have been triggered in the
interval (t, t + L] have not reached the inventory due to the lead-time. Consequently
we have the simple relationship
IL (t + L) = IP (t) - D (t, t + L).
(5.35)
The demand after t is obviously independent of the inventory position at time t.
Furthermore, we know from Proposition 5.1 that the distribution of IP(t) is uniform.
We can therefore relatively easily determine the distribution of the inventory level at
time t + L. Since t is an arbitrary time this is also the case for t + L. Consequently
we obtain the steady-state distribution.


k=max{R+1,j}
P(D(L) = k −j)
j ≤R + Q,
(5.36)
where we condition on the inventory position and use the fact that the inventory level
at time t + L can never exceed the inventory position at time t, i.e., k ≥j.
It is interesting to note that if we have determined these probabilities for one
value of R, for example R = 0, we can obtain the probabilities for other values of R
by a simple conversion. Although this is intuitively clear, we show this formally. Let
P (IL = j |R = r) be the probability for inventory level j when R = r. We then have
from (5.36)
P (IL = j |R = r ) = 1

(5.37)
In the special case of an S policy we have R = S −1 and Q = 1, and the inventory
position is always S. This means that (5.36) can be simpliﬁed to
P(IL = j) = P(D(L) = S −j)j ≤S.
(5.38)
5.3.4
Normally Distributed Demand
Let us now derive the corresponding relationship for normally distributed demand.
Recall that we assume that the continuous inventory position is uniformly distributed
on the interval [R, R + Q]. Let μ′ = μL and σ ′ = σL1/2 denote the mean and the
standard deviation of the lead-time demand. Furthermore, let f (x) and F(x) denote
the density and the distribution function of the inventory level in steady state. In
analogy with (5.36) we then have

When Q →0 this means simply that we are applying an S policy with S = R, i.e.,
the inventory position is kept at R all the time. The distribution of the inventory level
is then normally distributed. This is also easy to see from (5.35).
Example 5.4
Consider pure Poisson demand with λ = 2. Let the lead-time L = 5
and consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy with R = 9 and Q = 5. The lead-time
demand is obviously Poisson distributed with mean 10. Applying (5.36) we obtain

It is reasonable to compare P(IL = j) in the Poisson case by F(j + 0.5) −F(j−0.5),
i.e., to the probability that the continuous inventory level is between j −0.5 and
j + 0.5. For j = 1 we obtain the probability of an inventory level 0.5 ≤IL ≤1.5 as
F(1.5) −F(0.5) = 0.113. In Fig. 5.4 the distributions are compared for other values
of j. We can see that the normal distribution provides a very accurate approximation.
In case of continuous demand and continuous review, an order is triggered exactly
when the inventory position reaches the reorder point R. The order will arrive L time
units later. The average stock on hand just before the order arrives is denoted the
safety stock, SS, and is obtained as
SS = R −μ′.

5.4
Service Levels
When determining a suitable reorder point, or safety stock, we can base the reorder
point either on a prescribed service constraint or on a certain shortage or backorder
cost. In practice it is often regarded to be easier to specify a service level.
We shall consider three service level deﬁnitions:
S1 = probability of no stockout per order cycle
S2 = “ﬁll rate”-fraction of demand that can be satisﬁed immediately from stock
on hand
S3 = “ready rate”-fraction of time with positive stock on hand
The ﬁrst deﬁnition can be seen as the probability that an order arrives in time, i.e.,
before the stock on hand is ﬁnished. This service deﬁnition is very easy to use, but
it also has some important disadvantages. The problem is that S1 does not take the
batch size into account. If the batch size is large and covers the demand during a
long time, it does not matter much if S1 is low. Most of the time there is still plenty
of stock on hand due to the large batch size. If the batch quantity is small, the “real”
service can similarly be very low even if S1 is high. As a consequence S1 cannot be
recommended for inventory control in practice. It is considered in this book because
it is still used in many practical applications.
The ﬁll rate and the ready rate make the determination of the corresponding reorder
points a bit more complex, but on the other hand, will give a much better picture of
the customer service. In case of continuous demand or Poisson demand, S2 and S3
are equivalent. This is not the case, though, if a customer may order several units at
the same time. Even if the stock on hand is positive, the stock may not be sufﬁcient
to cover a large customer order. If the stock contains a small number of units on hand
most of the time, the ready rate can be high. Still the ﬁll rate may be very low if there
are some large customers who order huge quantities.
Service measures can also be deﬁned in many other ways. For example, it is
not necessary to deﬁne service by a probability. In some situations it can be more
adequate to require that the average customer waiting time does not exceed a certain
number of days.
From a practical point of view it is usually most important that the service level is
clearly deﬁned and interpreted in the same way throughout the company. It is obvi-
ously an advantage if it is possible to follow up the real customer service according
to the established deﬁnition. In general, it is not suitable to have the same service

80
5
Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
level for all different items. On the other hand, it may be impractical to use individual
service levels for all items. A common solution is to group the items in some way
and specify service levels for each group. See also Sects. 6.3 and 11.2.
The choice of service level should be based on customer expectations, or in other
words, the underlying shortage costs, and on the costs for giving good service. In
case of long lead-times and large demand variations, it may become very expensive
to maintain high service levels.
5.5
Shortage Costs
An alternative to a service level is to use a shortage cost. We shall consider two types
of shortage costs :
b1 = shortage cost per unit and time unit
b2 = shortage cost per unit
The choice of shortage cost deﬁnition should, of course, reﬂect the real costs that are
incurred by shortages.
A shortage cost of type b1, for example, is relevant for a spare part when a shortage
implies that a machine has to stop until the spare part is available again. The costs
are then proportional to the customer waiting time. Recall that we have already used
b1 in Sect. 4.4 in connection with deterministic demand. The shortage cost b1 can
also be interpreted as a cost per average number of backorders, as was explained in
Sect. 4.4.
If shortages are covered by overtime production to a higher cost, a shortage cost
of type b2 may be suitable.
One problem with shortage costs is that practitioners usually ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
determine how high they should be. It is, on the other hand, an advantage that a given
shortage cost makes it possible to balance shortage and holding costs and ﬁnd the
optimal customer service.
Independent of whether we use a service level or a shortage cost, the optimal
reorder point will increase with the service level or the shortage cost used. For a
certain item it is, in principle, always possible to determine the service level which
gives the same safety stock as a certain shortage cost, and the other way around. Such
relationships between service measures and shortage costs will, in general, depend on
data for the individual item, like its batch quantity, the mean and standard deviation
of lead-time demand, etc. An interesting exception is a relationship between the
service levels S2 and S3 and b1, which we shall derive in Sect. 5.9.2.
5.6
Determining the Safety Stock for Given S1
The service measure S1, i.e., the probability of no stockout per order cycle, is usually
used in connection with continuous review and continuous demand models. This
means that we order a batch Q exactly when the inventory position is R. The batch

size is assumed to be given. Our problem is to determine the reorder point R, such that
there is a certain speciﬁed probability S1 for the lead-time demand to be lower than
R. We will assume that the lead-time demand is normally distributed with average
μ′ and standard deviation σ ′. We obtain
P (D(L) ≤R) = S1 =

since SS = R −μ′. For a given value of S1 we have to choose the ratio SS/σ′ = k suf-
ﬁciently large. The required ratio k (easy to determine from the table in Appendix 2)
is often denoted the safety factor. After determining the safety factor we obtain the
safety stock simply as
SS = kσ ′.
(5.49)
Finally we get the reorder point as R = SS + μ′. Table 5.1 illustrates how the safety
factor grows with service level S1.
Note that the safety factor is increasing rapidly for large service levels.
5.7
Fill Rate and Ready Rate Constraints
Consider again a continuous review (R, Q) policy with a given batch quantity Q. We
will now see how we can determine the reorder point R to satisfy a given ﬁll rate S2
or ready rate S3.
5.7.1
Compound Poisson Demand
Consider ﬁrst compound Poisson demand and recall that we have derived the distri-
bution of the inventory level P(IL = j) in (5.36). The ready rate is the probability for
positive inventory level, i.e.,
S3 = P(IL > 0).
(5.50)
It is a little more complicated to determine the ﬁll rate because the demand size can
vary. Recall that fk is the probability for demand size k. We consider a customer
demand and get the ﬁll rate as the ratio between the expected satisﬁed quantity and
the expected total demand quantity.

(5.51)
If the positive demand size is k and the positive inventory level is j the delivered
quantity is min (j, k). In the special case of Poisson demand, we have f1 = 1 and
the expression for S2 in (5.51) degenerates to the expression for S3 in (5.50), i.e.,
S2 = S3 in that case.
It is evident that both S2 and S3 will increase with the reorder point R. Furthermore
R ≤−Q means that the stock is never positive, implying that both S2 and S3 are zero.
Consequently, for a given positive S2 (or S3) we know that we must have R > −Q.
Poisson or compound Poisson demand models are normally only used when the
demand is relatively low. Therefore, when determining the reorder point we can
simply increase R by one unit at a time starting from R = −Q until S2 obtained from
(5.51) (or S3 from (5.50)) exceeds the required service level. For each value of R we
need to recalculate the probabilities P(IL = j). It is then convenient to use (5.37).
5.7.2
Normally Distributed Demand
For continuous normally distributed demand, it is evident that S2 = S3 and the
service level is the probability of positive stock, which is obtained from (5.42)

(5.52)
Using G′(v) = 	(v) −1 it is easy to show that dS2/dR = dS3/dR > 0, i.e., S2 = S3
increases with R. For a given service level we can use a simple bisection search to
ﬁnd the smallest R giving the required service level. We start with a lower bound for
R, e.g., R = −Q, and an upper bound R, which gives a service level that exceeds
the required service level. Next we consider R = (R + R)/2. If the obtained service
is too low, R can replace R, and otherwise it can replace R. We continue like this
until the gap between R and R is sufﬁciently small.
It is common to approximate (5.52) by

From the table in Appendix 2 it is obvious that this approximation generally works
well for large values of Q. It can be of interest to use the approximation in manual
calculations, but it is not needed in a computerized inventory control system. Note
that (5.53) underestimates the service levels.

Fill Rate–a Different Approach
So far our approach has been to start by deriving the distribution of the inventory level
from (5.35). This must be regarded as the standard technique in inventory theory.
There is also another useful approach, which means that we focus instead on what
happens to an individual batch after being ordered. To illustrate this other approach
we shall once more derive the expression (5.52) for the ﬁll rate, or equivalently, the
ready rate.
We are studying a continuous review (R, Q) policy and the lead-time demand is
assumed to be continuous and normally distributed with mean μ′ = μL and standard
deviation σ ′ = σL1/2. We focus on a batch Q that is ordered when the inventory
position is R. This batch will later be consumed by customer demand. The reorder
point R will cover the demand for R units after the ordering time. So the considered
batch will be consumed by the demand for the Q units following after these ﬁrst
R units. When the batch arrives in stock, a part of this demand may have already
occurred, i.e., there are backorders waiting for the batch. Let
B = backordered quantity that will be covered by the batch
Note that we are only considering the backorders that are covered by the batch.
Therefore, we must have 0 ≤B ≤Q. If the backorders exceed Q when the batch
arrives in stock, the quantity exceeding Q is covered by future batches. If we know
E(B) we can obtain the ﬁll rate (and the ready rate) as
S2 = S3 = 1 −E(B)/Q.

It remains to determine E(B). Let u be the normally distributed demand during the
lead-time. We need to consider three cases:
u ≤R
means
B = 0,
R < u ≤R + Q
means
B = u - R,
R + Q < u
means
B = Q.
Consequently, E(B) can be determined by averaging over u

where we have used the deﬁnition of G(x) in (5.40). Combining (5.54) and (5.55)
we obtain (5.52).
Note that this derivation also covers the case when R is negative. This simply
means that a part of the demand that is covered by Q has already occurred when the
order is triggered.
5.9
Shortage Cost per Unit and Time Unit
We will now instead consider a shortage (or backorder) cost b1 per unit and time
unit. (Recall that we have dealt with this backorder cost in Sect. 4.4.) As before, we
consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy with given batch quantity Q, and we let μ′
and σ ′ represent mean and standard deviation respectively of the lead-time demand.
The holding cost per unit and time unit is denoted h. We optimize the reorder point
by minimizing the sum of expected holding and backorder costs. This means that
we are balancing backorder costs against holding costs. It is convenient to use the
notation
(x)+
= max (x, 0),
(x)−
= max (-x, 0),
Given the inventory level IL, the holding cost rate is h(IL)+ and the backorder cost
rate is b1(IL)−. Using x + −x−= x, we can express the total cost rate in different
ways
h(IL)+ + b1(IL−) = −b1IL + (h + b1)(IL)+ = hIL + (h + b1)(IL)−.
(5.56)

5.9
Shortage Cost per Unit and Time Unit
85
It is usually most convenient to use the second or third alternative in (5.56).
E(IL)−is the expected amount of backorders. Let μ be the average demand per
unit of time. Then the expected waiting time to satisfy a demand is E(IL)−/μ. This
is an application of the well-known Little’s formula from queuing theory. We can
interpret E(IL)−as the average queue length and μ as the average arrival rate to the
queue. Recall the related discussion for a deterministic setting in Sect. 4.4.
5.9.1
Compound Poisson Demand
Consider now compound Poisson demand. Recall that we have derived the distri-
bution of the inventory level in (5.36). When expressing the expected costs per unit
of time, C, it is in general, best to use the second alternative in (5.56) for discrete
demand. The reason is that we only need to consider a ﬁnite number of inventory
levels, because the inventory level cannot exceed the maximum inventory position
R + Q. We get
C = −b1E(IL) + (h + b1)E(IL)+ = −b1

(5.57)
where E(IL) is easily obtained as the average inventory position minus the average
lead-time demand.
Let us now regard the cost difference when using the reorder point R + 1 instead
of R.
C(R + 1) −C(R) = −b1 + (h + b1)

(5.58)
From (5.37) we know that P(IL = j |R ) = P(IL = j + 1 |R + 1). Using this we
have

jP(IL = j |R ) =

C(R + 1) −C(R) = −b1 + (h + b1)
R+1+Q

j=1
P (IL = j |R + 1 ) = −b1 + (h + b1)S3(R + 1).
(5.60)

Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
Because the ready rate increases with the reorder point,
it follows that
C(R + 1) −C(R) is increasing with R, i.e., the cost is convex in the reorder point.
Since S3 = 0 for R ≤−Q it follows directly from (5.60) that we do not need to con-
sider R < −Q. Consequently, to ﬁnd the optimal R we can start with R = −Q and
increase R by one unit at a time until the costs are increasing.
It is also interesting to note from (5.60) that there is always a special relationship
between the cost parameters and the ready rate in the optimal solution. The optimal
reorder point can be characterized as the largest reorder point giving a ready rate not
higher than b1/(h + b1). In other words, if R* is the optimal reorder point we have
S3(R∗) ≤
b1
h + b1
< S3(R∗+ 1)(5.61).
(5.61)
In case of pure Poisson demand this is also true for the ﬁll rate.
5.9.2
Normally Distributed Demand
For continuous normally distributed demand, the relationship between the cost pa-
rameters and the service levels ﬁll rate and ready rate is, as we shall see below, even
more striking. Recall that S2 = S3 in this case.
We start by evaluating the expected costs per unit of time. Let us now use the third
alternative in (5.56). As before we let F(x) be the distribution function and f (x) the
density of the inventory level.

and decreasing. The function H(x) is illustrated in Fig. 5.5.

Since dC/dR is increasing with R, C is a convex function of R. The optimal R is
obtained for dC/dR = 0, and in the optimal solution we have
S2 = S3 =

h + b1
.
(5.67)
Given a certain shortage cost b1, we can easily determine from (5.67) the service
level giving exactly the same reorder point. If we reformulate (5.67) as
b1 =
hS2
1 −S2
=
hS3
1 −S3
,
(5.68)
we can also go in the other direction, i.e., given a service level we can determine
an implicit shortage cost. The relations (5.67) and (5.68) (as well as (5.61)) are

88
5
Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
very useful when choosing service levels or shortage costs in practice. Consider,
for example, a company that works with service level constraints because it seems
difﬁcult to determine shortage costs. Still it may very well be possible to evaluate
whether a certain shortage cost is reasonable or not. Using (5.68), the shortage
costs corresponding to chosen service levels can be determined and discussed. Such
discussions are often very fruitful when trying to improve inventory control.
Note, however, that the considered “equivalence” between a certain ﬁll rate or
ready rate, and a corresponding shortage cost per unit and time unit, is only valid
when the order quantity Q is given and the optimization only concerns R. It is not
valid if we add ordering costs and carry out a joint optimization of both R and Q.
5.10
Shortage Cost per Unit
We shall now instead consider a shortage cost b2 per unit. As before, we consider
a continuous review (R, Q) policy. The demand is assumed to be continuous and
normally distributed. Except for the different type of shortage cost, the model is the
same as in (5.62). We assume that each unit which is demanded when the stock level
is zero or negative incurs the cost b2. Using (5.62) and (5.42), the costs per time unit
C can now be expressed as

It can be shown that the costs in (5.69) and (5.70), although not convex, have a unique
local minimum. See Chen and Zheng (1993) and Rosling (2002).
It is common to replace the exact costs by a simpler approximate cost expression.
If there are relatively few backorders we can disregard the second term in (5.69) and

(5.70). Furthermore, if Q is relatively large we can also disregard the second term in

where S1 is the probability of no stockout per order cycle. Note that the right hand
side of (5.73) can become negative for certain parameters. But S1 is a service level
and cannot be negative. The reason that this can happen is our approximation. If this
occurs in practice, we have to replace the right hand side in (5.73) by some given
lowest service level.
5.11
Continuous Review (s, S) Policy
We shall now consider an (s, S) policy instead of an (R, Q) policy. We are still
assuming continuous review. Recall that an (s, S) policy means that an order is
triggered as soon as the inventory position declines to or below the reorder point s.
The order size is chosen so that the inventory position increases to S. (See Fig. 3.2.)
First of all, we note that an (s, S) policy is equivalent to an (R, Q) policy with
s = R and Q = S −s as long as we know that the inventory position is exactly s
when the order is triggered. In case of continuous review this equivalence is true for
both continuous demand and for pure Poisson demand. It is not true, however, for
compound Poisson demand with demand sizes larger than one. Here we will only
consider such demand since we have already dealt with (R, Q) policies in Sect. 5.3.
In Proposition 5.1 in Sect. 5.3 we proved that the steady-state distribution of the
inventorypositionincaseofan(R,Q)policyisuniformontheintegers[R + 1, R + Q].
With an (s, S) policy the inventory position is obviously always in the corresponding
interval [s + 1, S], but it is in general not uniformly distributed on these values. We
therefore need to determine the distribution.
Note ﬁrst that the transitions of the inventory position IP are a renewal process.
Each time an order is triggered and a new order cycle begins, the inventory position
is raised to S and we have a regeneration. We shall now consider the number of
customers and the transitions of the inventory position between two orders (regen-
erations). For each customer arrival we consider the inventory position just after the

90
5
Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
arrival when both the demand and a possible replenishment order have taken place.
Let
mj = probability to reach IP = j during an order cycle (s + 1 ≤j ≤S)
As before, fk is the probability of demand size k (recall that we assume that f0 = 0).
Obviously mS = 1 since we start each cycle with IP = S. No inventory position can
be visited more than once during an order cycle. We can come to IP = j from some
IP = k > j provided the next demand is k −j. When determining mj we consider all
IP > j. We get
mj =
S

k=j+1
mkfk−j,
j = s + 1, s + 2, ..., S -1.
(5.74)
From (5.74) it is easy to determine the probabilities mj recursively for j = S−1,
S−2,. . . , s + 1. Note that mj can also be interpreted as the expected number of
visits to IP = j during an order cycle. Each transition of the inventory position is
triggered by a customer. The average total number of customers during an order
cycle is therefore S
j=s+1 mj. Since the customers arrive according to a Poisson
process, the average time between two arrivals is always the same. This means that
we can obtain the steady-state distribution of the inventory position as
P (IP = k) = mk/
S

j=s+1
mj, k = s + 1, s + 2, ..., S.
(5.75)
Note that these probabilities only depend on S-s, i.e., if, for example, we increase
both s and S by the same number, we get the same probabilities. Furthermore, if
we have determined the probabilities mj for s = s′and S = S′ and want to consider
s = s′−1 and S = S′, the probabilities ms′+1,. . . , mS′ are unchanged and we only
need to determine ms′ from (5.74).
Example 5.5
Let the probabilities for demand sizes 1 and 2 be f1 = f2 = 1/2.
Consider an (s, S) policy with s = 5 and S = 8. We obtain m8 = 1 and according to
(5.74)
m7 = m8/2 = 1/2,
m6 = m7/2 + m8/2 = 3/4.
The average number of customers in an order cycle is m6 + m7 + m8 = 9/4. We
ﬁnally get the distribution of the inventory position from (5.75) as P(IP = 6) = 3/9,
P(IP = 7) = 2/9, and P(IP = 8) = 4/9. Obviously this distribution is far from uniform.
After obtaining the distribution of the inventory position from (5.75) we can derive
the distribution of the inventory level in complete analogy with (5.36).

5.12
Periodic Review–Fill Rate
91
The determination of various performance measures for a given inventory level dis-
tribution is straightforward and parallels essentially corresponding expressions for
(R, Q) policies.
5.12
Periodic Review–Fill Rate
Let us now consider an inventory system that is controlled by a periodic review
policy instead of a continuous review policy. Periodic review means that the inventory
position is inspected at the beginning of each period and that all replenishments are
triggered at these reviews. A period may, for example, be a day or a week. First of
all it is obvious that if the review period is short enough there is not much difference
between periodic and continuous review. In such a case, continuous review results
can be used as an approximation in periodic review systems and the other way around.
Quite often, though, the review period cannot be disregarded.
5.12.1
Basic Assumptions
As before, we assume a constant lead-time L. Furthermore we let T be the review
period. It is common to assume that the lead-time is an integral number of periods,
but we shall not introduce that restriction.
It is important to understand that the assumptions regarding when in the period
the demand takes place, and when in the period various performance measures are
evaluated, may affect the results and the optimal policy. Let us, for example, consider
a situation with L = 0 and no ordering costs. If all demand takes place at the beginning
of a period and it is possible to order immediately after that, we do not need to keep
any stock. We just have to order the period demand in each period, and because the
lead-time is zero, the delivery will take place instantaneously. We shall assume that
the demand in a period is spread out over the whole period as we have assumed in the
previously considered continuous review models. This is the most natural assumption
in most applications. Evidently this means that we need some stock also if L = 0.
Furthermore, we shall focus on evaluation of the ﬁll rate. Assume, for example,
that the inventory is controlled by an (R, Q) policy and that the batch quantity Q is
given. We can use the results in this section to ﬁnd the smallest R that satisﬁes a
given ﬁll rate.
Consider Fig. 5.6 and let t be an arbitrary review time. The orders can take place
at times . . . , t, t +T, . . . A possible order at time t is delivered at time t + L. The
next possible delivery time is evidently t + L +T. When determining the ﬁll rate we
consider the interval between these two times. It is easy to determine the expected
demand in the considered interval. Furthermore, it is clear that the demand that can
be delivered from stock on hand in this interval depends only on the inventory level
after the possible delivery at time t + L and the total stochastic demand in the interval.

Note that the ﬁll rate is also the same for most other demand assumptions, e.g., if
the whole demand takes place just after the delivery at time t + L or just before the
next possible delivery at time t + L +T.
In this section we shall ﬁrst deal with discrete compound Poisson demand both
for (R, Q) policy and (s, S) policy. Thereafter we consider an (R, Q) policy and
continuous normally distributed demand. We refer to Sobel (2004) and Tijms (1994)
for more details and other assumptions.
5.12.2
Compound Poisson Demand–(R, Q) Policy
We shall ﬁrst consider discrete compound Poisson demand. Recall that such demand
models are mainly of interest in case of relatively low demand. Consider again
Fig. 5.6. We shall ﬁrst determine the distribution of the inventory level at the two
times t + L and t + L +T, i.e., the start and the end of the considered interval. At time
t + L we consider the inventory level after a possible delivery, but at time t + L +T,
a possible delivery has not taken place.
Consider an (R, Q) policy and the transitions of the inventory position at the review
times after a possible order. Recall that we in the continuous review case instead con-
sidered the times when customer demands occurred. The associated Markov chains
are essentially the same if we let the period demand here correspond to the demand
per customer in the continuous review case. Under some mild assumptions (see
Sect. 5.3.1), the steady-state distribution of the inventory position will be uniform.
For a discrete demand distribution it is uniform on the integers [R + 1, R + Q].
The inventory level IL′ at time t + L after a possible delivery can be obtained as
IL′ = IL(t + L) = IP(t) −D(L),
(5.77)
because orders after time t have not been delivered at time t + L. Recall that we can
determine the distribution of the demand over a given time according to (5.3), or
more simply according to (5.15) in case of a logarithmic compounding distribution.
The distribution of IL′ can consequently be obtained as in (5.36), i.e.,
P (IL′ = j) = 1
Q
R+Q

k=max{R+1,j}
P(D(L) = k −j)
j ≤R + Q.
(5.78)
The distribution of the inventory level IL′′ at time t + L +T before a possible delivery
can be determined in exactly the same way. It is just to replace L by L +T in the
computations.

5.12
Periodic Review–Fill Rate
93
Consider now the interval between the two times t + L and t + L +T.The expected
demand during one unit of time is μ = λ ∞
j=1 jfj, where λ is the intensity of the
customer arrivals and fj is the probability of demand size j. The expected demand
in the considered interval of length T is obviously μT.
Consider then the part of the demand in the considered interval between t + L and
t + L +T that cannot be met from stock on hand. This demand is backordered so it
can be determined as E(IL′′)−−E(IL′)−. This means that we can determine the ﬁll
rate as
S2 = 1 −E(IL′′)−−E(IL′)−
μT
.
(5.79)
When determining E(IL′′)−and E(IL′)−it is usually most practical to use that
E(IL)−= E(IL)+ −E(IL), because IL+ ≤R + Q is bounded. E(IL′) and E(IL′′)
are easily obtained as R+ (Q + 1)/2 −μL and R+ (Q + 1)/2-μL +T), respectively.
Recall that the inventory position immediately after the order at time t is uniform on
[R + 1, R + Q].
Example 5.6 Consider pure Poisson demand with λ = 0.1 the lead-time L = 5 and
the review period T = 1.5. Furthermore, R = 1 and Q = 2. We get E(IL′′)−= 0.01925
and E(IL′)−= 0.00913. Using (5.79) we get S2 = 0.933.
5.12.3
Compound Poisson Demand–(s, S) Policy
We can also handle (s, S) policies essentially as in Sect. 5.11. Let
gj = probability that the period demand, i.e., the demand D(T) during a period of
length T, is j (j = 0, 1,. . .),
mj = average number of periods with IP = j during an order cycle.
Recall that the period demand essentially corresponds to the demand by a single
customer in the continuous review case. In Sect. 5.11 we assumed that the size of
a customer demand is at least one unit. We shall now also consider the possibility
of zero period demand, which requires a minor modiﬁcation of the technique in
Sect. 5.11 (see also Zheng and Federgruen 1991). If the period demand is zero the
inventory position will not change. Consequently we have mS = 1/(1 −g0), and in
analogy with (5.74)
mj =

mkgk−j = mjg0 +

From (5.81) we can determine the values of mj recursively for j = S −1, S −2,. . . ,
s + 1. We can then get the distribution of the inventory position as in (5.75)
P (IP = k) = mk/

P(IP = k)P(D(L) = k −j), j ≤S.

We can then apply Eq. 5.79 just as in Sect. 5.12.2.
5.12.4
Normally Distributed Demand–(R, Q) Policy
Let us now consider an (R, Q) policy and continuous normally distributed demand.
As before, we denote the mean and standard deviation of the demand per unit of time
by μ and σ. Furthermore, the mean and standard deviation of the demand during
the lead-time L are denoted μ′ = Lμ and σ ′ = L1/2σ. We shall also consider the
demand during the time L +T and the corresponding mean and standard deviation
μ′′ = (L +T)μ and σ ′′ = (L +T)1/2σ.
Consider again Fig. 5.6. The inventory position IP just after the arbitrary review
time t is now uniform on the continuous interval (R, R + Q]. We can again apply
(5.77), and in complete analogy with (5.39) and (5.42) we obtain the inventory level
distribution at time t + L after a possible delivery as
F(x) = P (IL′ ≤x) = σ ′

(5.84)
We then use the same approach as in Sect. 5.12.2 and 5.12.3. First we note that the
expected demand in the interval between t + L and t + L +T is μT. We then evaluate
the expected demand that cannot be met from stock on hand during this interval.
This demand is backordered so it can be determined as E(IL′′)−−E(IL′)−. We can
then get the ﬁll rate as
S2 = 1 −E(IL′′)−−E(IL′)−
μT
.
(5.85)
It therefore only remains to determine E(IL′′)−and E(IL′)−. Using (5.63) and (5.84)
we have

(5.86)
We get E(IL′′)−in exactly the same way. We just have to replace μ′ and σ ′ by μ′′
and σ ′′ in (5.86).
Example 5.7 Consider a normal approximation of the data in Example 5.6. We get
μT= 0.15, μ′ = 0.5, σ ′ = 0.51/2 = 0.707, σ ′′ = 0.65 and σ ′′ = 0.651/2 = 0.806. For
R = 1 and Q = 2 we get from (5.86) E(IL′′)−= 0.038 and E(IL′)−= 0.017. Using
(5.85) we get S2 = 0.86. Because we are dealing with very low demand, the size of
the error is not surprising.
5.13
The Newsboy Model
Let us now consider a classical inventory problem, the so-called newsboy model.
There is a single period with stochastic demand. We assume that it is normally
distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ. We have to determine how much
to order before the period starts. There are penalty costs associated with ordering
both too much and too little compared to the unknown stochastic period demand.
The problem is to optimize the size of the order.
Let
x = stochastic period demand
S = ordered amount
co = overage cost, i.e., the cost per unit for a remaining inventory at the end of the
period
cu = underage cost, i.e., the cost per unit for unsatisﬁed period demand
Using the original interpretation of the problem, we can think of a newsboy who can
buy copies of a newspaper for 25 cents early in the morning each day and sell them
for 75 cents during the day. He is not paid anything for unsold copies. In that case
we have co = 25, and cu = 75–25 = 50. For a given demand x the costs are
C(x) = (S −x)co
x < S,
(5.87)
C(x) = (x −S)cu
x > S,
(5.88)

(5.91)
It is easy to see that C is convex, so (5.91) provides the optimal solution.
Example 5.8 Let us return to our example with co = 25 and cu = 50. Assume that
the daily demand for newspapers is normally distributed with mean μ = 300 and
standard deviation σ = 60. Applying (5.91) we obtain the optimal solution from

implying that (see the table in Appendix 2)

or, equivalently, S ≈326 copies of the newspaper.
The same problem occurs in many other contexts. Here are a few examples. A
garment retailer has to decide on the quantity of various style goods before the short
selling season. A supermarket must decide on the quantities of fresh meat to buy
each day. A farmer must decide on quantities of different crops to be planted in a
certain season.
So far we have assumed that the problem concerns a single period. The simple
newsboy solution (5.91) is, however, also common in multiperiod settings as in
Sect. 5.12. Assume ﬁrst that the lead-time is zero and that we apply an S policy at
the beginning of each period. The period demand is normally distributed with mean
μ and standard deviation σ. Units that are left over at the end of a period can be
used in the next period, but we have a holding cost h per unit and period. Similarly, a

5.14
A Model with Lost Sales
97
possible shortage at the end of a period is backordered and can be ﬁlled in the coming
period. The backorder cost per unit and time unit is b1. The problem considered is
a newsboy problem with co = h, and cu = b1. If we have a lead-time of L periods
the problem is still a newsboy problem. We just have to consider the demand during
L + 1 periods instead of the demand during a single period. This means that the mean
μ and standard deviation σ in (5.91) should be replaced
by the mean μ′′ = (L + 1)μ and standard deviation σ ′′ = (L + 1)1/2σ correspond-
ing to L + 1 periods.
5.14
A Model with Lost Sales
In this section we leave the assumption of complete backordering and assume instead
that demand that cannot be met immediately is lost. Otherwise the model is similar
to that in Sect. 5.10. We refer to Rosling (2002b) for a more complete model.
Again we consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy. Note ﬁrst that the inventory
position can never become negative, because in a lost sales model there are no
backorders so the inventory level cannot be negative. We must therefore assume
that R ≥0. We shall also make the standard simplifying assumption that Q > R.
Consequently, if one order is outstanding the inventory position is strictly above
the reorder point and no more orders can be triggered. Recall that the inventory
level is nonnegative. The simplifying assumption implies, therefore, that there can
be at most one outstanding order. The demand is assumed to be continuous and
normally distributed. The demand per time unit has mean μ and standard deviation
σ. Consequentlythedemandduringtheconstantlead-timeL,D(L),hasmeanμ′ = Lμ
and standard deviation σ ′ = (L)1/2σ. There is a holding cost per unit and time unit,
h, and a shortage cost per unit lost, b2. (Note that a shortage cost per unit and time
unit does not make sense in a lost sales model.)
We shall also assume that hQ/2 < b2μ, since otherwise it is not proﬁtable to
operate the system. To see this, note that a batch Q will at least incur the average
holding costs hQ2/2μ corresponding to the case when there is no stock on hand when
the batch is delivered. The batch will cover the demand Q. This means that we will
avoid the shortage costs Qb2. The system can only be proﬁtable to operate if the
expected holding costs are lower than the avoided shortage costs. This means that
we must require that hQ2/2μ < Qb2, or, equivalently, hQ/2 < b2μ.
Consider a complete order cycle between two deliveries of a batch. Recall that
Q > R. Consequently, when a batch has been delivered, there is ﬁrst a stochastic time
until the reorder point is reached and the next batch is ordered. During this time there
are no outstanding orders and the inventory level IL = IP > R ≥0, i.e., no lost sales
can occur. When the inventory level reaches R, a new batch is ordered. This batch
is delivered after the lead-time L. Lost sales will occur if the stochastic lead-time
demand exceeds the reorder point. Let us ﬁrst determine the average lost sales during

Theaveragelengthofanordercyclemustbe(Q + E(R −D(L))−)/μ, sincealldemand

The average inventory on hand just before the delivery at the beginning of the
order cycle considered is
E(R −D(L))+ = E(R −D(L)) + E(R −D(L))−= R −μ′ + σ ′G
R −μ′
σ ′

.
(5.93)
Note that the inventory on hand at the beginning of the cycle and the demand during
the cycle are independent stochastic variables. Therefore, the average time in stock
for an item in the batch that is delivered at the beginning of the order cycle can be
obtained as E(R −D(L))+/μ + Q/(2μ). (The ﬁrst term is the expected time before
the batch starts being consumed. As usual we disregard the occurrence of negative
demand.) The corresponding holding costs are hQ[E(R −D(L))+ + Q/2]/μ. The total
costs per time unit can consequently be expressed as
C =

+ b2μσ ′G( R−μ′
σ ′ )
Q + σ ′G( R−μ′
σ ′ )
.
(5.94)
The costs in (5.94) can be minimized with respect to R. It is possible to show that the
costs have a single local optimum. It is therefore easy to ﬁnd the optimal solution.
Recall that R ≥0. Furthermore, the model is only an approximation for R > Q. If
the model is used for R > Q, the lost sales are underestimated and an optimization
will give a reorder point R that is too low. We have assumed that the lead-time is
constant, but independent stochastic lead-times can be handled in essentially the
same way.
If we compare (5.94) to the corresponding costs with complete backordering,
(5.69) or (5.70), we can see that the cost expressions, as expected, approach each
other when the average lost sales during an order cycle are small compared to the
batch quantity Q. If we disregard the term σ ′G((R −μ′)/σ ′) in the ﬁrst term in the
numerator and in the nominator, we obtain the approximate cost expression (5.71)
with the simple solution (5.73). This solution is often a good approximation also in
the lost sales case (2002b).
It is also easy to evaluate the ﬁll rate in the considered model.
S2 =
Q
Q + σ ′G( R−μ′
σ ′ )
.
(5.95)
In (5.95) we use the fact that the total demand in an order cycle consists of two parts,
the demand that is satisﬁed from stock on hand Q, and the lost sales σ ′G((R−μ′)/σ ′).

Stochastic Lead-times
5.15.1
Two Types of Stochastic Lead-times
So far we have only dealt with constant lead-times. It is quite common, though, that
the supply process is also stochastic and we shall therefore show how stochastic lead-
times can be incorporated in inventory models. Here we shall describe two different
types of stochastic lead-times. (Also other types are possible.) In Sects. 5.15.2 and
5.15.3 we show how they can be handled, and in Sect. 5.15.4 we provide a numerical
comparison.
1. Sequential deliveries independent of the lead-time demand
By sequential deliveries we mean that orders cannot cross in time. These types
of stochastic lead-times are most common in practice. Consider, for example, a
situation where we order from a factory or from an external supplier, and assume
that the orders placed with the outside supplier are delivered according to a ﬁrst-
come, ﬁrst-served policy. The orders can then not pass each other. The stochastic
lead-time for a certain order may depend on the previous demand due to earlier
orders that have caused congestion in the supply system, but the demand after the
order will not affect the lead-time.
Let us also give an example of when the stochastic lead-times are not independent
of the lead-time demand and therefore do not belong to type 1. Assume, for
example, that we order from a factory and that the factory produces many different
items. If the factory gives higher priority to items for which there are many orders,
the lead-times can evidently be affected by the lead-time demand.
2. Independent lead-times
The second type of lead-times, i.e., independent stochastic lead-times, may occur
if the orders are served by many independent servers. If the lead-time for a certain
order is long, it may then happen that later demands will trigger orders that will
be delivered earlier than the order considered.
In many situations it is complicated to model lead-times of type 1. Consider for
example, orders to a factory and assume that the stochastic lead-time at a certain
time depends on the queues in front of some machines, and that these queues
are due to previous orders for the item. To model such lead-times we may need
to include both the inventory and the queues in an integrated model. See e.g.,
Song (1994) and Zipkin (1986, 2000) for a further discussion of different types
of stochastic lead-times. Similar situations may also occur in connection with
multi-echelon inventory systems, where shortages at a higher echelon may cause
stochastic delays for lower echelons. See Chap. 10.

Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
In practice it is usually more difﬁcult to evaluate stochastic variations in the lead-
times compared to demand variations. Unless the lead-time variations are large,
it is then reasonable to disregard them and replace a stochastic lead-time by its
mean. As we shall see in Sect. 5.15.3, this is also exact in some situations when
dealing with independent stochastic lead-times.
5.15.2
Handling Sequential Deliveries Independent
of the Lead-time Demand
Consider ﬁrst a continuous review inventory model with stochastic lead-times of the
ﬁrst type. Since the orders cannot pass each other, it is evident that (5.35) is still
valid, i.e.,
IL (t + L) = IP (t) - D (t, t + L (t)),
(5.96)
where L(t) is the stochastic lead-time that occurs at time t.
Assume that a certain (R, Q) policy is used and deﬁne
IP = stochastic inventory position in steady state
IL = stochastic inventory level in steady state
D = stochastic lead-time demand when averaging over L
i.e., for discrete demand
P(D = j) = E
LP((D(L) = j)).
(5.97)
Let now t in (5.96) be a completely arbitrary time. Note that this means that t + L
is also a completely arbitrary time. Furthermore, L(t) is an arbitrary stochastic lead-
time. We get
IL = IP- D,
(5.98)
which can be used in the same way as we have used (5.35) in case of a constant
lead-time.
For compound Poisson demand the distribution of the inventory level can be
obtained through a slight generalization of (5.36). We simply average over different
lead-times

(5.100)

(5.101)
Lead-times of the ﬁrst type should, in principle, be handled as in (5.99)–(5.101). It
is often practical, though, to use a simple approximation where the distribution of
the demand during a stochastic lead-time is replaced by a normal distribution with
correct mean and variance. As before, we denote the mean and standard deviation of
the demand per time unit by μ and σ. We obtain the mean of D as
E(D) = μE(L).
(5.102)
For a given L, E{(D(L))2} = σ 2L + (μL)2. The variance of D can then be determined
as
Var(D) = E

σ 2L + (μL)2
−μ2(E(L))2
= σ 2E(L) + μ2Var(L) + μ2(E(L))2 −μ2(E(L))2
= σ 2E(L) + μ2Var(L).
(5.103)
If we set μ′ = E(D) and σ ′ = (Var(D))1/2, we can then, as an approximation, use
expressions for constant lead-times like (5.39), (5.42), (5.43), etc.
5.15.2.1
Handling Independent Lead-Times
We shall consider a well-known and interesting result. Assume an S policy and
Poisson demand with intensity λ, i.e., each demand triggers an order. This also means
that the orders can be described by the same Poisson process as the demands. The
stochastic lead-times are independent but otherwise general. We can see the supply
system as an (M/G/∞) system. (M stands for Poisson arrivals, G for a general lead-
time distribution, and ∞for an unlimited number of servers.) According to Palm’s
theorem (Palm 1938), the total occupancy in an (M/G/∞) system (Poisson arrivals,
general service time and unlimited number of servers) is Poisson distributed with
mean λE(L). So the outstanding orders have a Poisson distribution that only depends
on the expected value of the lead-time. This means that we can replace the stochastic
lead-time by its mean or by exponential service times, or whatever we feel is easy to
deal with.

102
5
Single-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
It is a little surprising that in the considered situation a stochastic lead-time will not
give any disadvantages compared to a constant lead-time. One reason is that when
orders cross in time we can always use the earliest deliveries to satisfy customer
demands. So, items do not, in general, satisfy customer demands in the same order
as they are replenished from the supplier.
In case of compound Poisson demand, the number of outstanding orders (but not
the number of items) is still Poisson.
5.15.3
Comparison of the Two Types of Stochastic Lead-Times
We shall illustrate the differences between the two types of lead-times by an example.
Example 5.9 Consider pure Poisson demand with intensity λ = 2 and an (S −1, S)
policy with S = 3.
Assume ﬁrst that the orders placed with the outside supplier are served by a single
server with exponential service time and service rate κ = 2.5. This means that the
supplier is modeled as an (M/M/1) queuing system. The lead-time, i.e., the waiting
timeincludingtheservicetime, isevidentlyoftype1. Itiswell-knownthatthewaiting
time has an exponential distribution with density (κ −λ)e−(κ −λ)t = 0.5 e−0.5t. Using

(5.105)
i.e., the inventory level has a geometric distribution with P(IL = j) = 0.2 · 0.83−j
(j ≤3).
Let us now instead assume that the stochastic lead-times are service times in an
(M/M/∞) system, i.e., the supplier is modeled as a queuing system with inﬁnitely
many servers and exponential service times. Let us also assume that the service rate
for each server is κ = 0.5. This means that the distribution of the lead-time is exactly
the same as in the above situation with a single server. The lead-times are, however,
now of the second type, i.e., independent. Using the results in Section 5.15.3 we can

(5.106)
The two different inventory level distributions are compared in Fig. 5.7.
Recall that the lead-time distribution is the same in both cases. It is obvious that
the inventory level varies much less in case of independent lead-times. This is, in
general, advantageous since it is easier to avoid large backorder levels.
Note also that a constant lead-time is both of type 1 and of type 2.

6.1
Joint Optimization of Order Quantity and Reorder Point
In practice it is most common to determine the batch quantity from a deterministic
model. The stochastic demand is then replaced by its mean. In Chap. 4 we have con-
sidered different methods for determination of batch quantities under the assumption
of deterministic demand. Stochastic variations in the demand, and possibly in the
lead-time, are then only taken into account when determining the reorder point. As
discussed in Chap. 4 this procedure is, in general, an adequate approximation. In
Chap. 5 we have described various techniques for determining the reorder point for
a given batch quantity.
It is also possible, though, to optimize the batch quantity and the reorder point
jointly in a stochastic model. In this section we shall consider such techniques.
6.1.1
Discrete Demand
Assume discrete compound Poisson demand. Each customer demands an integral
number of units. As before, we also assume that not all demands are multiples of
some integer larger than one. The average demand per unit of time is denoted μ.
The lead-time L is constant. The stochastic lead-time demand is denoted D(L) and
its mean μ′ = μL.
Furthermore, we consider a holding cost h per unit and time unit, a shortage cost
b1 per unit and time unit, and an ordering or setup cost A.
6.1.1.1
(R, Q) Policy
We shall ﬁrst deal with a continuous review (R, Q) policy and the joint optimization
of the integers R and Q. A periodic review model can be handled in essentially the
same way. See also Federgruen and Zheng (1992).

Single-Echelon Systems: Integration–Optimality
Recall the following standard argument from Sect. 5.3.2. Let IP(t) be the inventory
position at time t. Consider then the time t + L. At that time, everything that was on
order at time t has been delivered. Orders that have been triggered in the interval
(t, t + L] have not reached the inventory due to the lead-time. Consequently we have
IL (t + L) = IP(t) −D (L).
(6.1)
Let us initially consider the special case of an (S −1, S) policy with S = k, i.e.,
R = k −1 and Q = 1. This means that the inventory position is k at all times. Using
Eq. (6.1) the inventory level distribution can then be obtained as
P(IL = j) = P(D(L) = k −j),
j ≤k.
(6.2)
Let g(k) be the average holding and shortage costs per time unit. We have from Eq.
(5.56)
g(k) = −b1E(IL) + (h + b1)E(IL+) = −b1(k −μ′) + (h + b1)
k

j=1
jP(IL = j).
(6.3)
The results in Sect. 5.9.1 imply that g(k) is a convex function of the inventory position
k. Furthermore g(k) →∞as |k| →∞.
Let us now go back to the (R, Q) policy. Recall that the inventory position is
uniform on [R + 1, R + Q]. Consequently the total average costs per time unit can
be expressed as
C(R, Q) = Aμ
Q + 1
Q
R+Q

k=R+1
g(k).
(6.4)
In Eq. (6.4) we obtain the holding and backorder costs by averaging over the inventory
position. We assume that each batch incurs an ordering cost A, i.e., if an order for two
batches is triggered, the associated ordering cost is 2A. Our objective is to optimize
C(R, Q) with respect to both R and Q.
Let us now deﬁne C(Q) as
C(Q) = min
R {C(R, Q)}.
(6.5)
It is evident that C(1) =Aμ + mink {g(k)}, i.e., if the sum in Eq. (6.4) includes a
single value of k, we choose a k that gives the minimum cost. We denote an optimal
k, i.e., a value of k that minimizes g(k) by k∗. A corresponding optimal reorder point
for Q = 1 is R∗(1) = k∗−1, i.e., if we use a single value of k, we choose the best one.
Consider now Q = 2, whichmeansthatweusetwovaluesof k. Duetotheconvexityof
g(k), the second best k must be either k∗−1 or k∗+ 1. Clearly, we should use the bet-
terofthesetwovalues. FromEq. (6.4)itisthereforeevidentthatitisoptimaltochoose

R∗(2) = R∗(1) −1 if g(R∗(1)) ≤g(R∗(1) + 2), and R∗(2) = R∗(1) otherwise. We ob-
tain C(2) =Aμ/2 + [min{g(R∗(1)), g(R∗(1) + 2)} + g(R∗(1) + 1)]/2, or equivalently,
C(2) = C(1)/2 + min{ g(R∗(1)), g(R∗(1) + 2)}/2. More generally we have
R∗(Q + 1) = R∗(Q) −1
if g(R∗(Q)) ≤g(R∗(Q) + Q + 1),
R∗(Q + 1) = R∗(Q)

It is evident from Eq. (6.7) that C(Q + 1) ≥C(Q) if and only if min{g(R∗(Q),
g(R∗(Q) + Q + 1)} ≥C(Q).
Furthermore,
it
is

that
min{g(R∗(Q),

C(Q + 1) ≥C(Q). It follows from Eq. (6.7) that C(Q) ≥C(Q∗) for any Q ≥Q∗.
Consequently, Q∗and R∗(Q∗) provide the optimal solution.
To summarize, it is very easy to determine the optimal solution by applying Eqs.
(6.6) and (6.7) until the costs increase.
6.1.1.2
(s, S) Policy
Let us now instead consider the optimization of an (s, S) policy. Otherwise the
assumptions are exactly the same as above. When using an (s, S) policy the inven-
tory position is no longer uniformly distributed. This makes the optimization more
complex. Zheng and Federgruen (1991), however, have developed a very efﬁcient
optimization procedure. We shall here only describe the procedure and refer to their
paper for proofs and more details.
In Sect. 5.11 we deﬁned and determined the probabilities
mj = probability to reach IP = jduring an order cycle (s + 1 ≤j ≤S).
The average total number of customers during an order cycle is S
j=s+1 mj. Let λ
be the customer arrival rate. The average length of an order cycle is consequently
S
j=s+1 mj/λ. The steady state distribution of the inventory position is obtained as
P (IP = k) = mk/

Single-Echelon Systems: Integration–Optimality
We are now ready to describe the optimization procedure.
1. In the ﬁrst step we set S∗= k∗, i.e., a value of k that minimizes g(k). Next, consider
s = S∗−1, s = S∗−2,. . ., until C(s, S∗) ≤g(s). When this occurs, set s∗= s and
the initial best solution as C∗= C(s∗, S∗). Set S = S∗.
2. Set S = S + 1. If g(S) > C∗, s∗and S∗provide the optimal solution with the costs
C∗, and the algorithm stops.
3. It is possible to show that the considered S will improve the solution if, and only
if, C(s∗, S) < C∗. In that case set S∗= S. Otherwise go to 2.
4. To ﬁnd the best s corresponding to S∗, it is only necessary to consider s = s∗,
s∗+ 1,. . . The new s∗is obtained as the smallest value of s giving C(s, S∗) >
g(s + 1). Update C∗= C(s∗, S∗) and go to 2.
6.1.2
An Iterative Technique
Now consider normally distributed demand instead, and add ordering costs to the (R,
Q) model with backorder cost per unit and unit time that we dealt with in Sect. 5.9.2.
The lead-time demand has mean μ′ and standard deviation σ ′. The mean per unit of
time is μ.
By adding the average ordering costs per time unit to the cost expression in Eq.
(5.65) we have
C(R, Q) = h(R + Q/2 −μ′)
+ (h + b1)σ ′2

Recall the deﬁnitions of H(x) and G(x). See Appendix 2.
Our objective is to optimize C(R, Q) with respect to R and Q. As pointed out in
Sect. 5.9.2, we cannot replace the backorder costs by the ﬁll rate Eq. (5.67) when
carrying out a joint optimization of R and Q.
We shall demonstrate how the optimization can be carried out by a simple iterative
procedure (Rosling 2002b, c).
We obtain ∂C/∂R as in Eq. (5.66)

For a given Q we can use Eq. (6.11) to determine the corresponding reorder point R
giving ∂C/∂R = 0. The resulting R decreases with Q. We can also get ∂C/∂Q from
Eq. (6.10) as

We shall now describe an iterative procedure for ﬁnding a solution satisfying
∂C/∂Q = ∂C/∂R = 0.
We start by determining the batch quantity according to the classical economic
order quantity model
Q0 =

2Aμ/h.
(6.13)
Next we determine the corresponding reorder point R0 from Eq. (6.11) and the
condition ∂C/∂R = 0. In the following step we get a new batch quantity Q1 from

(6.14)
After that we determine the reorder point R1 corresponding to Q1 from Eq. (6.11)
and the condition ∂C/∂R = 0. Given Q1 and R1, we obtain Q2 and R2 in the same
way, etc.
It can be shown that the batch quantity increases in each step, Qi + 1 ≥Qi, while
the reorder point decreases, Ri + 1 ≤Ri. The costs decrease in each step.
Example 6.1 LetA = 100, h = 2, and b1 = 20. The demand per time unit is normally
distributed with μ = 50 and σ = 20. The lead-time is L = 4. We obtain μ′ = μL = 200
and σ ′ = σL1/2 = 40.
The results from the iterations when applying the described procedure are shown
in Table 6.1. We can see that the costs converge very rapidly. The changes in batch
quantity and reorder point as compared to the initial solution are signiﬁcant. Still the
total cost reduction is only about 2.5 %.
Similar procedures for models with other types of costs can be designed in the
same way. We could, for example, have used a shortage cost per unit as in Sect. 5.10.
A corresponding procedure for a model with lost sales is given in Rosling (2002a).
6.1.3
Fill Rate Constraint: A Simple Approach
We shall now consider a different and very simple technique from Axsäter (2006).
This technique is especially suitable when optimizing R and Q under a ﬁll rate

constraint, because it is in general only necessary to consider relatively few different
ﬁll rates. The cost function is the same as in Eq. (6.10) except for the backorder costs
that are omitted

It is possible to show that the considered problem has a pure optimal strategy, i.e., a
single (R, Q) as its optimal solution, see Rosling (2002b).
At a ﬁrst glance the problem to optimize Eq. (6.15) under the constraint Eq. (6.16)
for a given ﬁll rate S2 depends on ﬁve parameters: h, A, μ, μ′, and σ ′. However, it is
easy to see that the problem does in fact depend on a single parameter only. Deﬁne
c = C/(hσ ′),
q = Q/σ ′,
r = (R −μ′)/σ ′,
E = Aμ/(h(σ ′)2).
Substituting in Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16) we get the equivalent problem to minimize
c = r + q
2 + 1
q [H (r) −H (r + q)] + E
q ,
(6.17)
under the constraint
S2 = 1 −1
q [G (r) −G (r + q)].
(6.18)
Note that this version of the problem for a certain given S2 depends on a single
problem parameter, E ≥0.
Axsäter (2006) suggests that q∗is determined by linear interpolation of tabulated
values (or by using a polynomial approximation). (The tabulated values can, for
example, be obtained by using the technique in Sect. 6.1.2.) The corresponding r* is
then obtained from Eq. (6.18) in a second step. A part of the required table is given
in Table 6.2.
We are now ready to describe a simple way to solve the original problem for
a given ﬁll rate S2 and any problem parameters. We start by determining E. Next
we obtain the solution of the one-parameter problem from the table and Eq. (6.18).
Given the optimal solution q∗and r∗, we get the solution of the original problem as
Q∗= q∗σ ′,
R∗= r∗σ ′ + μ′.
Note that we can use the same table repeatedly for all items.

i.e.,
except for the backorder cost,
the same data as in Example 6.1.
We get E =Aμ/(h(σ ′)2) = 1.5625 and e = ln (E) = 0.4463.
Using the ta-

we

Using
Eq.
(6.18) we get r∗= 0.3294. Finally we obtain Q∗= q∗σ ′ = 2.5555 · 40 = 102.22
and R∗= r∗σ ′ + μ′ = 0.3294 · 40 + 200 = 213.18. The corresponding optimal
solution is Q∗= 102.20 and R∗= 213.14.
6.2
Optimality of Ordering Policies
In all the models that we have considered in this chapter it has been assumed that the
policy is either of the (R, Q) type or of the (s, S) type. A natural question to ask is
whether other, better policies exist. This is, in general, not the case. In most situations
one of these policies is indeed optimal for a single-echelon inventory system with
independent items.
In Sect. 6.2.1 we shall show that an (R, Q) policy is optimal when there are no
ordering costs but a given ﬁxed batch quantity Q. After that we comment on the
optimality of (s, S) policies in Sect. 6.2.2.
6.2.1
Optimality of (R, Q) Policies When Ordering in Batches
Consider an inventory system with continuous review. Assume discrete compound
Poisson demand and that each customer demands an integral number of units. As

114
6
Single-Echelon Systems: Integration–Optimality
before, we assume that not all demands are multiples of some integer larger than
one. The average demand per unit of time is denoted μ. The lead-time L is constant.
The stochastic lead-time demand is denoted D(L) and its mean μ′ = μL.
Furthermore, we consider a holding cost h per unit and time unit and a shortage
cost b1 per unit and time unit. There are no ordering costs but all orders must be
multiples of a given batch quantity Q. Orders can only be triggered by customer
demands. We shall show that an (R, Q) policy is optimal under these assumptions.
Our proof follows essentially Chen (2000).
Obviously the inventory position must be an integer at all times. Assume ﬁrst that
the inventory position is k at some arbitrary time t. Using Eq. (6.1) the inventory
level distribution at time t + L can be obtained as
P(IL = j) = P(D(L) = k −j),
j ≤k.
(6.19)
Furthermore, (as in Sect. 6.1.1.1), let g(k) be the corresponding holding and shortage
cost rate at time t + L. We have
g(k) = −b1E(IL) + (h + b1)E(IL+) = −b1(k −μ′) + (h + b1)
k

j=1
jP(IL = j).
(6.20)
As shown in Sect. 5.9.1, g(k) is a convex function of the inventory position k.
Furthermore g(k) →∞as |k| →∞.
Deﬁne now
¯g(y) =
Q

j=1
g(y + j),
where y is an integer. Clearly ¯g(y) is also convex. Denote by R the ﬁnite integer y
that minimizes ¯g(y).
Lemma 6.1 Let x and z be integers. For a given z, g(z + xQ) is convex in x. Let xz
be the unique integer so that R + 1 ≤z + xzQ ≤R + Q. Then g(z + xQ) is minimized
with respect to x for x = xz.
Proof It follows from the convexity of g(k) that g(z + xQ) is convex in x. Note that
g(z + (x + 1)Q) −g(z + xQ) = ¯g(z + xQ) −¯g(z + xQ −1).
(6.21)
Consider ﬁrst any x < xz. This means that z + xQ ≤R. Obviously ¯g(z + xQ) −¯g(z +
xQ−1) ≤0. Similarly, x > xz implies z + xQ > R + Q and ¯g(z+xQ)−¯g(z+xQ−
1) ≥0. It follows that g(z + xQ) is minimized with respect to x for x = xz.
We are now ready to prove the following proposition.

6.2
Optimality of Ordering Policies
115
Proposition 6.1 An (R, Q) policy is optimal.
Proof Consider any feasible policy. Let yt be the inventory position at time t. The
cost rate at time t + L is then g(yt). From Lemma 6.1 we know that g(yt) ≥g(y′
t)
where y′
t = yt + nQ and n is the unique integer so that y′
t∈{R + 1, R + 2, . . ., R + Q}.
Consequently, the long-run average cost must be greater than or equal to the long-
run average value of g(y′
t). To determine these costs consider the stochastic process
y′
t. Obviously y′
t is constant between the customer demands. Let Dt be a demand at
some time t. Let y−
t be the inventory position before the demand and y+
t the inventory
position after the demand. Clearly
y+
t = y−
t −Dt + mQ,
(6.22)
where m is nonnegative. Furthermore, due to our construction we must also have,
y′
t
+ = y′
t
−−Dt + m′Q,
(6.23)
where m′ is an integer. Given y′
t
−and Dt, the value of m′ is unique because y′
t∈{R + 1,
R + 2, . . ., R + Q}. The demand sizes are independent, so the different y′
t can be seen
as a Markov chain with the ﬁnite state space {R + 1, R + 2, . . ., R + Q}. The steady
state distribution can be shown to be uniform. (This can be done in essentially the
same way as the proof of Proposition 5.1 in Sect. 5.3.1. We omit the details.)
The long-run average value of g(y′
t) is therefore ¯g(R)/Q. This is a lower bound
on the long-run cost of any feasible policy. But this lower bound can be achieved by
using an (R, Q) policy. Using an (R, Q) policy the inventory position is also uniform
on {R + 1, R + 2, . . ., R + Q}. (We obtain the costs by setting A = 0 in Eq. (6.4).)
This completes the proof.
Proposition 6.1 can be generalized in different ways, for example to other cost
structures and to periodic review. In the special case when Q = 1 the (R, Q) policy
degenerates to an S policy with S = R + 1. This means that Proposition 6.1 also
demonstrates the optimality of an S policy in case of no ordering costs and no
constraints concerning the batch quantities.
For problems with continuous or Poisson demand, (R, Q) policies and (s, S)
policies are equivalent. For such problems (s, S) policies are consequently also
optimal.
6.2.2
Optimality of (s, S) Policies
If we replace the ﬁxed batch quantity in Sect. 6.2.1 by an ordering cost the optimal
policy is under quite general conditions of the (s, S) type. This is more difﬁcult to
show, see e.g., Porteus (2002).
It is interesting to note, however, that (s, S) policies are not necessarily optimal
for problems with service constraints. Consider, for example, a problem with dis-
crete integral demand where s and S are integers. It may very well happen that no

116
6
Single-Echelon Systems: Integration–Optimality
(s, S) policy provides a certain given service level exactly. The best (s, S) policy that
satisﬁes the service constraint will consequently give a slightly higher service than
what is required. In such a situation it may be possible to reduce the costs by varying
the policy over time so that the average service level is exactly as prescribed.
Early optimality results were presented by Iglehart (1963) and Veinott (1966).
More recent results are provided by Zheng (1991), Rosling (2002b), and Beyer and
Sethi (1999) .
6.3
Updating Order Quantities and Reorder Points in Practice
In Chaps. 2–5 we have presented different techniques for forecasting and deter-
mination of batch quantities and reorder points. We shall now illustrate how these
techniques can be implemented in an inventory control system. We assume that we
are dealing with a single-echelon system and independent items.
The forecasts are normally updated with a certain periodicity. In general, it is
most practical to also update reorder points and batch quantities at these times,
immediately after updating the forecasts. Let
tF =
forecast period
We can think of the forecast period as, for example, one month. The time unit is
not important. We can use one month as the time unit. In that case tF = 1, but we
can also express tF in days (tF = 30), or in years (tF = 1/12). However, to avoid
unnecessary errors it is recommended to use the same time unit in all inventory
control computations.
Typically the forecasts are updated either by exponential smoothing (Sect. 2.4),
or by exponential smoothing with trend (Sect. 2.5). It may also be reasonable to use
a seasonal method (Sect. 2.6) for a few items. The forecasting method is, in general,
chosen manually for each item. To specify the forecasting method, we also need the
smoothing parameters that are part of the different forecasting methods. Usually it
is practical to divide the items into a number of inventory control groups and let the
forecasting technique as well as various inventory control parameters, like holding
cost rate and service level, be identical for all items in the same group. See also
Chap. 11.
When using exponential smoothing we update the average demand ˆatat the end
of each forecast period. If instead we use exponential smoothing with trend, we
update both the average demand ˆat and the trend ˆbt. In either case we also update
(by exponential smoothing) some error measure like MADt (Sect. 2.10).
In case of exponential smoothing the average demand per unit of time μ is
obtained as
μ = ˆat/tF.
(6.24)
When using exponential smoothing with trend we are, in principle, assuming that
the demand is increasing or decreasing linearly with time. However, most of our

6.3
Updating Order Quantities and Reorder Points in Practice
117
techniques are based on the assumption of stationary demand processes. What can
be done relatively easily is to let the demand at a certain time be replaced by its
forecast for that time. This usually works well unless the trend is large or the demand
variations are very signiﬁcant.
The standard deviation of the demand per time unit is obtained according to Eqs.
(2.50) and (2.55) as
σ =
1
(tF)c
π
2 MADt,
(6.25)
where the parameter c = 1/2 if we assume that forecast errors in different time periods
are independent. This can be regarded as the standard assumption. The parameter c
is always in the interval (0.5, 1).
Assume that a continuous review (R, Q) policy is used for inventory control. Since
the items are treated independently we shall consider a certain item with lead-time L.
The lead-times are in general different for different items. Our ﬁrst step is to update
the batch quantity Q. The most common technique is to use the classical economic
order quantity model and let the average demand per time unit μ replace the constant
demand per unit of time. As in Eq. (4.3) we obtain
Q =

2Aμ
h
.
(6.26)
The ordering cost, A, is in general, the same for items belonging to the same inventory
control group. The holding cost, h, is usually determined as a certain percentage of
the value of the item. This carrying charge should include capital costs as well as
other types of holding costs. Usually the carrying charge is the same for all items in
the same inventory control group, but the holding costs vary among the items because
of different values of the items. A typical carrying charge could be something like
10–15 % if we use one year as the time unit. The carrying charge is normally higher
than the interest rate charged by the bank. See Sects. 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.
We can use μ from Eq. (6.24) in Eq. (6.26). Recall also from Sect. 4.1.2 that the
costs are very insensitive to small errors in the batch quantity, so it may be reasonable
to use simple approximations.
Itisalittlemorecomplicatedtotakeseasonaldemandvariationsintoaccountwhen
determining batch quantities. In practice it is therefore quite common to disregard
the effect of the seasonal variations on the batch quantities.
To be able to determine the reorder point, we next need to determine the distribu-
tion of the lead-time demand. Let μ′ and σ ′ be the mean and average of the lead-time
demand just after the forecast update. We have
μ′ = ˆat

L.

Single-Echelon Systems: Integration–Optimality
It is not common to take stochastic variations in the lead-time into account. One
reason is that it is usually difﬁcult to determine the lead-time distribution. If the
lead-time variations are known and the deliveries are sequential it is easy to use the
approximation based on Eqs. (5.102) and (5.103).
Given the mean and standard deviation, the most common approach is to assume
that the lead-time demand is normally distributed. For items with low demand it may
sometimes be more appropriate to use a Poisson distribution or a compound Poisson
distribution. If we assume that the normal distribution is used and that there is a given
ﬁll rate S2 (See Sect. 5.4), it is easy to determine the reorder point R from Eq. (5.52).
In case of compound Poisson demand we can apply Eqs. (5.36) and (5.51).
Note that in this section we have used models for stationary demand also when
there is a trend in demand. This approximation is usually satisfactory as long as the
trend is relatively small compared to the average.
Example 6.3
We shall update forecast, batch quantity, and reorder point for an
item controlled by a continuous review (R, Q) policy. The updates take place at
the end of each month, and we use one month as our time unit, i.e., tF = 1. We
apply exponential smoothing with smoothing constant α = 0.1 when updating both
the forecast and MAD. At the end of the preceding month we obtained the forecast
ˆa = 132 and MAD = 42. We have just received the demand during the last month
as 92. The batch quantity is determined according to the classical economic order
quantity model. The holding cost is $ 1.5 per unit and month, and the ordering cost
$ 200. The lead-time is two months. The ﬁll rate is required to be 95 %. The demand
can be regarded as continuous and normally distributed, and forecast errors during
different time periods are assumed to be independent.
As our ﬁrst step we update the forecast and MAD
ˆa = 0.9 · 132 + 0.1 · 92 = 128,
MAD = 0.9 · 42 + 0.1 · |132 −92| = 41.8.
Next we determine the batch quantity
Q =

2 · 200 · 128
1.5
= 184.75 ≈185.
It remains to determine the reorder point R from Eq. (5.52). First we obtain μ′ and
σ ′ as
μ′ = 2 · 128 = 256,
σ ′ =
√
2 ·
π
2 · 41.8 = 74.09.
Finally, using the search procedure described in connection with Eq. (5.52) we obtain
R = 313.62 ≈314.
We have assumed a continuous review (R, Q) policy. Periodic review can be
handled as described in Sect. 5.12. When using an (s, S) policy instead of an (R, Q)
policy it is common in practice to ﬁrst determine R and Q for an (R, Q) policy and
then apply the simple approximation s = R and S −s = Q.

Chapter 7
Coordinated Ordering
In Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6 it was assumed that different items in an inventory could be
controlled independently. We shall now leave this assumption and consider situations
where there is a need to coordinate orders for different items. In this chapter we shall
still, as in Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6, assume that the items are stocked at a single location.
(Multi-stage inventory systems are dealt with in Chaps. 8, 9, and 10.) We consider
traditional inventory costs and constraints, i.e., holding costs, ordering or setup costs,
and backorder costs or service constraints.
When coordinating the replenishments for different items, it is common to use
cyclic schedules, and especially so-called powers-of-two policies. In Sect. 7.1 we
derive some important results for such policies.
There are two main reasons for coordinating the replenishments of a group of
items. One reason, dealt with in Sect. 7.2, is that we wish to get a sufﬁciently smooth
production load. Assume, for example, that a considered group of items is produced
in the same production line. We then want to coordinate the orders for different items
so that they are evenly spread over time.
The other main reason for coordinated replenishments, which is treated in
Sect. 7.3, is completely opposite. We want to trigger orders for a group of items
at the same time. This can be advantageous in many situations. It may be possible
to get a discount if the total order from the same vendor is greater than a certain
breakpoint. It may also be possible to reduce the transportation costs, for example,
by ﬁlling a truckload. Sometimes the setup costs can also be lowered substantially
if a group of similar items are produced together in a machine.
7.1
Powers-of-Two Policies
Both when using mathematical algorithms and when choosing schedules manually,
it is very common to use so-called powers-of-two policies in connection with coor-
dinated replenishments. This means that the cycle times are restricted to be powers
of two times a certain basic period. If the basic period is, for example, 1 week, non-
negative powers of two give 20 = 1 week, 21 = 2 weeks, 22 = 4 weeks, 23 = 8 weeks

Coordinated Ordering
etc. With negative powers of two we also obtain 2−1 = 1/2 week, 2−2 = 1/4 week,
etc. A main advantage of such cycle times is that we obtain relatively simple cyclic
schedules. Consider, for example, two items that are produced every fourth and every
eighth week, respectively. The total cycle time is then 8 weeks, since everything is
repeated every eighth week. If instead of 4 and 8 weeks we use the similar cycle
times 5 and 7 weeks, the total cycle time would be 5 · 7 = 35 weeks, i.e., more than
four times longer. Assume, for example, that both items are produced in week 1. The
item with cycle time 5 weeks is then produced in weeks 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36,
etc., and the other item, with cycle time 7 weeks, in weeks 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, etc.
So week 36 is the ﬁrst time after week 1 when both items are produced.
Consideranumberofitemswithconstantcontinuousdemand. Givenholdingcosts
and ordering costs we wish to determine suitable batch quantities, or equivalently
cycle times. (See Sect. 4.1.1.) We shall show that a restriction to powers-of-two
policies will give a solution which is very close to the optimal solution.
Consider ﬁrst a single item. Recall the following result from Sect. 4.1.2.

(7.1)
which gives the relative cost increase when deviating from the optimal batch quantity
Q∗in the classical economic order quantity model. The expression (7.1) is valid
also with a ﬁnite production rate (Sect. 4.2). Furthermore, since we are dealing
with constant demand, d, we can just as well express the policy through the cycle
time T = Q/d where T ∗= Q∗/d is the optimal solution. This means that we can
equivalently formulate (7.1) as
C
C∗= 1

(7.2)
We shall consider cycle times and the representation (7.2) when deriving our results
on the approximation errors, but it is important to note that the results are also valid
for the batch quantities.
Consider now a powers-of-two solution of a lot sizing problem, i.e., assume that
the cycle time T has to be chosen as
T = 2mq,
(7.3)
where m can be any integer and where, for the time being, we assume that the basic
period q is given. Assume that T ∗cannot be expressed according to (7.3). We then
have to choose either the next lower or the next higher T satisfying (7.3). Due to (7.3),
the ratio between these two values is 2. Note also that the best solution under the
constraint (7.3) is not affected if q is multiplied by a power of two. If, for example,
q is multiplied by 2, we can reduce m by 1 to get the same result.
What is the worst possible relative cost increase caused by restricting the solution
with the constraint (7.3)? Because of the convexity, the worst possible error must

occur when two consecutive values of m, say m = k and m = k + 1 give the same
error. Let T <T∗correspond to m = k, and 2T >T ∗to m = k + 1. We obtain

(7.6)
We formulate this result as a proposition.
Proposition 7.1 For a given basic period q, the maximum relative cost increase of
a powers-of-two policy is 6 %.
We have only discussed a single item, but Proposition 7.1 is evidently also true
if there are several items, because the worst case occurs when all items incur the
maximum error of 6 %.
Let us now assume that it is possible to change q. For a single item we will then
get the optimal solution simply by choosing q equal to a power of two times T ∗.
If, however, we have N items (items i = 1, 2,. . ., N), we can, in general, not ﬁt q
perfectly to all cycle times T ∗
i , which depend on the problem data for different items.

Assume now that we change q by multiplying by 2y, where 0 ≤y ≤1. (Recall that
multiplying q by a power of two does not affect the solution, so we are considering
the most general change.) If we do not change x this is equivalent to replacing x
by x + y. However, if x + y > 1/2 it is advantageous to change x to x −1. This
means that a certain x is replaced by x + y for x + y ≤1/2, and by x + y −1 for
x + y > 1/2. Consequently we have

For a given distribution F(x) the minimum cost increase is obtained by minimizing
(7.10) with respect to 0 ≤y ≤1.
We are now ready to prove Proposition 7.2, which shows that the maximum
relative error is surprisingly low.
Proposition 7.2 If we can change the basic period q, the maximum relative cost
increase of a powers-of-two policy is 2 %.

The worst case will occur when the distribution F(x) is uniform on −1/2 ≤x ≤1/2,
see (7.9). A change of q will then not make any difference.
This completes the proof.
Powers-of-two policies are important ingredients of Roundy’s so-called 98 %
approximation. See Sects. 7.3.1.2 and 9.2.2.

Production Smoothing

7.2
Production Smoothing
In general, it is a very complicated problem to control the stocks of different items in
such a way that we get both low inventory costs and smooth capacity utilization. To
simplify the problem it is common to ﬁrst disregard stochastic demand variations and
solve the remaining deterministic problem. Safety stocks are then usually determined
in a second step using techniques for independent items, see Chap. 5. However, the
deterministic problem can also be very difﬁcult, especially if there are many items
with time-varying demand and several capacity constraints.
When the demands for different items are relatively stable over an extended period,
it is often advantageous to use cyclic schedules as a means to obtain a smooth
production load. This means that each item is ordered periodically, and that the
ordering periods for different items are chosen such that the load becomes as smooth
as possible.
Consider, for example, a machine that is used for producing four items (items
1–4) all with about the same demand. It can then be a good idea to decide that item
1 is produced in weeks 1, 5, 9. . ., item 2 in weeks 2, 6, 10. . ., item 3 in weeks 3, 7,
11. . ., and item 4 in weeks 4, 8, 12. . . . This can be organized by applying periodic
review order-up-to-S policies. Each item has a review period equal to 4 weeks, but
the reviews take place in different weeks. Since the machine is producing exactly
one of the items each week, the load will be very smooth. As we have discussed in
Chap. 3, we need, for a given lead-time, more safety stock when applying a periodic
review policy as compared to a policy with continuous review. But the alternative of
using a continuous review policy would in this case probably yield large variations
in the production load, which would in turn, result in long and uncertain lead-times.
Longer lead-times would also mean that we need more safety stock. Furthermore, if
we applied a continuous review policy, the capital tied up as work-in-process would
increase and lead to additional holding costs. In a situation like this, the total costs
would generally be much lower when using the cyclic schedules obtained through
the periodic review policy.
In a general case with many items and several production facilities, it can be
extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd suitable cyclic schedules. In Sect. 7.2.1 we will deal with
different mathematical approaches for solving the problem in the special case when
there is only a single machine. In practice it is most common to choose cyclic
schedules manually without using mathematical techniques.
When the demand is time-varying, one possible approach is to formulate the
problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) and apply mathematical programming
techniques to obtain a solution. A typical formulation involves a number of items
with given demands over a planning horizon, and holding and setup costs as in the
dynamic lot size problem (Sect. 4.5). To produce an item, we need to use certain
production resources with limited capacities. We shall consider such a model in
Sect. 7.2.2.
Situations where it is, for various practical reasons, very difﬁcult to coordinate
the replenishments for different items are quite common. It can then still be possible

126
7
Coordinated Ordering
to get a reasonably smooth ﬂow of orders simply by adjusting the order quantities.
We discuss such adjustments in Sect. 7.2.3.
It is also common in practice to smooth production outside the inventory control
system. Orders obtained from the inventory control system are then not automatically
released to production. Release times and order quantities are instead adjusted with
respect to the present production load. One possible planning rule can, for example,
be to not release more orders than there is capacity to produce within some ﬁxed
time frame. Adjustments of the release times mean essentially that the safety stocks
are allowed to vary over time in order to smooth the load. We know from the models
in Chaps. 4 and 5 that small changes in batch quantities and safety stocks will, in
general, not affect the costs signiﬁcantly, while larger changes can have a substantial
impact. When adjusting the orders obtained from the inventory control system, it is
therefore important to avoid large changes for individual items. In this context it is
also interesting to note that ordering systems of KANBAN type will automatically
limit the number of outstanding orders. See Sects. 3.2.3.1 and 8.2.1.
7.2.1
The Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP)
7.2.1.1
Problem Formulation
We shall now consider a problem that has been dealt with extensively in the inventory
literature, the classical Economic Lot Scheduling Problem. This problem concerns
the determination of cyclic schedules for a number of items with constant demands.
Backorders are not allowed. The production rate is ﬁnite and we wish to minimize
standard holding and ordering costs. Everything is as in the elementary model in
Sect. 4.2 with one exception; the items are all produced in a single production fa-
cility, i.e., we have a capacity constraint. It turns out that this additional constraint
transforms a simple model into a very challenging problem.
We assume that batch quantities and, equivalently, cycle times are kept constant
over time. Let us introduce the following notation:
N =
number of items,
hi =
holding cost per unit and time unit for item i,
Ai =
ordering or setup cost for item i,
di =
demand per time unit,
pi =
production rate (pi > di),
si =
setup time in the production facility for item i, independent of the sequence
of the items,
Ti =
cycle time for item i (the batch quantity Qi = Ti di).
We shall also for simplicity deﬁne:
ρi =
di/pi,
τi =
ρiTi = production time per batch for item i excluding setup time,
σi =
si + τi = total production time per batch for item i.

Table 7.1 shows data for N = 10 items. This sample problem was ﬁrst presented
by Bomberger (1966) and has since then been used extensively in the literature on
economic lot scheduling.
7.2.1.2
The Independent Solution
Expressing the costs for item i, Ci, as a function of the cycle time, Ti, we have
Ci = Ai
Ti
+ hidi(1 −ρi)Ti
2 .
(7.11)
The problem is to minimize N
i=1 Ci subject to the constraint that all items should
be produced in the common production facility.
A ﬁrst approach to solving the problem could be to disregard the capacity con-
straint and simply optimize each item separately as in Sect. 4.2. The optimal cycle
time when disregarding the capacity constraint is
Ti =

2Ai
hidi(1 −ρi),
(7.12)
and the corresponding cost
Ci =

2Aihidi(1 −ρi).
(7.13)
Note that (7.11) and (7.12) are equivalent to (4.6) and (4.7) if we replace Ti by Qi/di.
Table 7.2 shows this “independent” solution of Bomberger’s problem. The last
row gives the corresponding production times per lot for each of the 10 items.

128
7
Coordinated Ordering
The sum of the costs, C = 10
i=1 Ci = 31.62, is evidently a lower bound for the
total costs, since we have disregarded the capacity constraint.
Is the solution feasible? No, it is relatively easy to see that the solution in Table 7.2
cannot be implemented. Consider, for example, items 4, 8, and 9. Assume that the
production of item 9 starts at some time t. The production of the following batch will
then start at time t + 61.5 etc. Since σ9 = 11.20, the production facility is occupied
by item 9 during the interval (t, t + 11.20). Items 4 and 8 have cycle times 19.5
and 20.5. This means that we must be able to produce one batch of item 4 and one
batch of item 8 in the interval (t, t + 20.5). Given the production schedule for item
9, this implies that both items must be produced in (t + 11.20, t + 20.5). The length
of this interval is only 9.30, while σ4 + σ8 = 10.16. The independent solution can
consequently not be implemented.
7.2.1.3
Common Cycle Time
Does a feasible solution exist? Note ﬁrst that if at least one setup time is positive, an
obvious necessary condition for a feasible solution to exist is that
N

i=1
ρi < 1.
(7.14)
The left-hand side of (7.14) is the ratio of the time the production facility must be
busy (excluding setup time). Since we also need some time for the setups, we can
see that (7.14) is necessary. (If all setup times are zero, (7.14) should be replaced by
N
i=1 ρi ≤1.) It is easy to verify that (7.14) is satisﬁed for Bomberger’s problem.
It turns out though, that the condition (7.14) is also sufﬁcient for feasibility. If it
is satisﬁed, it is always possible to ﬁnd a feasible solution where all items have a
common cycle time. Denote the common cycle time by T. During the cycle time we
produce all items, each time in the same order. The production quantity for an item
is the demand during the cycle time. By choosing T sufﬁciently large, we can reduce
the ratio of the time needed for setups as much as we need. This explains why (7.14)
is sufﬁcient.
Given the assumption of a common cycle time, the problem now is to minimize

(7.18)
Since (7.15) is convex in T, the optimal solution, Topt, is obtained as
Topt = max( ˆT , Tmin),
(7.19)
i.e., if ˆT < Tmin the best we can do is to choose Topt = Tmin.
For Bomberger’s problem we obtain ˆT = 42.75 and Tmin = 31.86, and conse-
quently, Topt = ˆT = 42.75. This gives the costs ¯C = 41.17, which is an upper
bound for the optimal solution since we have enforced the additional constraint that
all cycle times have to be equal.
At this stage we know that the optimal costs, C∗, are in the interval C = 31.62 ≤
C∗≤¯C = 41.17. For Bomberger’s problem it is rather evident that the upper bound
is not especially tight. If we look at the independent solution in Table 7.2, we can
see that some of the cycle times are very different, and we can therefore not expect a
good solution with a common cycle time. For problems where the individual cycle
times are reasonably similar, we can, on the other hand, expect the common cycle
approach to give a very good approximation.
We shall now consider two approaches for deriving better solutions.
7.2.1.4
Bomberger’s Approach
Bomberger (1966) generated feasible upper bound solutions by a relatively simple
dynamic programming model. First it is assumed that each cycle time Ti is an integer
multiple of a basic period W, i.e., Ti = niW for some positive integer ni. Bomberger
also makes the very restrictive assumption that W should be able to accommodate
production of all items. To see that this condition is not necessary, consider two items
(item 1 and item 2), which both have T1 = T2 = 2W. We can then produce item 1
in periods 1, 3, 5. . ., and item 2 in periods 2, 4, 6. . ., and we will never have to
produce both items in the same basic period. The condition will, however, obviously
guarantee that the obtained solution is feasible. Let

130
7
Coordinated Ordering
Fi(w) = minimum cost of producing items i + 1, i + 2,. . ., N when the available
capacity in the basic period is w, i.e., W – w has been used for items 1,
2,. . ., i.
We now have
Fi−1(w) = min
ni {Ci(niW) + Fi(w −σi)},
(7.20)
where Ci(niW) are the costs (7.11) for item i with Ti = niW, σ i = si + ρiniW, and
the integer ni is subject to the constraint
1 ≤ni ≤(w −si)/ρiW.
(7.21)
Note that the upper bound in (7.21) is equivalent to σi ≤w.
It is obvious that FN(w) = 0 for all w ≥0. In the ﬁrst step we determine FN −1(w)
for a suitable grid of values of w ≥0 from (7.20). Given FN −1(w), we can next
determine FN −2(w), etc. F0(W) gives the minimum costs when the basic period is
equaltoW.IntheﬁnalstepweneedtooptimizeF0(W)withrespecttoW.Bomberger’s
solution of his example gave the costs C = 36.65 for W = 40, ni = 1 for i ̸= 7, and
n7 = 3. This solution is a considerable improvement as compared to the common
cycle approach.
Bomberger’s approach is simple and will always provide a feasible solution (if a
feasible solution exists). Still, the assumption that W should be able to accommodate
production of all items is very restrictive. Later contributions (Elmaghraby 1978, and
Axsäter 1984, 1987), have improved the approach and provide considerably better
solutions.
7.2.1.5
A Simple Heuristic
We shall now consider a completely different heuristic technique (essentially ac-
cording to Doll and Whybark 1973). The procedure means that we successively
improve the multipliers ni and the basic periodW according to the following iterative
procedure:
1. Determine the independent solution and use the shortest cycle time as the initial
basic period W.
2. Given W, choose powers-of-two multipliers, (ni = 2m, m ≥0), to minimize the
item costs (7.11).
3. Given the multipliers ni, minimize the total costs

4. Go back to Step 2 unless the procedure has converged. In that case, check whether
the obtained solution is feasible. If the solution is infeasible, try to adjust the
multipliers and then go back to Step 3.
The main disadvantage of the considered heuristic is that there is no guarantee for
even a feasible solution. On the other hand, the computations are very easy.
We shall apply the heuristic to Bomberger’s problem. In Step 1 we start with the
shortest cycle time in Table 7.2 as our basic period W = 19.5. In Step 2 we obtain
the powers-of-two multipliers n1 = 8, n2 = 2, n3 = 2, n4 = 1, n5 = 2, n6 = 4, n7 = 8,
n8 = 1, n9 = 4, and n10 = 2. In Step 3 we get W = 20.30. At this stage the algorithm
has converged and we have to check whether the solution is feasible. We can see
that this is not the case by using an argument which is very similar to the argument
that we used to show that the independent solution is infeasible. We consider again
items 4, 8, and 9, and determine σ4 = 4.45, σ8 = 5.81, and σ9 = 14.55. Consider a
basic period when item 9 is produced. Since items 4 and 8 are produced in all basic
periods, the production of all three items must take place in the considered basic
period, i.e., during the time 20.30. This is obviously impossible. A major problem is
the long production time for item 9. To reduce σ9, we change n9 from 4 to 2 and start
the iterations in Step 3. We get W = 23.42 and no more changes of the multipliers,
see Table 7.3.
It turns out that this solution is feasible, see Table 7.4. The total production time
is below W = 23.42 in each basic period. The total costs are C = 32.07, i.e., very
close to the lower bound. This is also the best-known solution of the problem.
The solution inTable 7.4 is repeated every 8th period. Note that it is easier to check
feasibility when using powers-of-two policies since the total cycle time is usually
relatively short. There are still, however, a large number of plans that correspond to
the solution in Table 7.3. If ni = 4, for example, we can produce item i in periods 1
and 5, or in periods 2 and 6, or in periods 3 and 7, or in periods 4 and 8, i.e., there are
4 possibilities. More generally the number of possibilities for item i is equal to ni. We
can, however, without any lack of generality, always allocate one of the items with
maximum ni, say item 1, in some arbitrary period. If, consequently, we disregard

Although the classical economic lot scheduling problem involves only a single
production facility, it can also be of interest in more general situations. For example,
if there are several production facilities with limited capacities, it is quite common
that one of the constraints constitutes the real bottleneck. It is then a reasonable
approach to ﬁrst derive a plan that only takes this constraint into account, and then
in a second step, try to adapt the plan to other capacity limitations.
A more detailed overview of different approaches to solving the problem is
provided in Elmaghraby (1978). Feasibility issues are analyzed by Hsu (1983).
7.2.1.6
Other Problem Formulations
InSects. 7.2.1.1, 7.2.1.2, 7.2.1.3, 7.2.1.4, and7.2.1.5wehaveconsideredtheclassical
Economic Lot Scheduling Problem. Several papers have dealt with a variation of this
problem. This more general formulation of the problem allows the lot sizes to vary
over time. There is still a cycle time T, which is the overall period of the system. The
schedule repeats itself every T units of time. Each item is produced during T but
some items may be produced more than once. Furthermore, the batch sizes of these
runs may be different. See, for example, Dobson (1987, Roundy (1989), and Zipkin
(1991).
Gallego and Roundy (1992) allow backorders, while Gallego and Moon (1992)
consider a situation where setup times can be exchanged by setup costs.
There are also quite a few papers dealing with stochastic demand. In case of
stochastic demand it is necessary to allow backorders and/or capacity variations, for
example by using overtime production. See Sox et al. (1999) for a review. They
classify the existing research approaches in two categories: cyclic sequencing and
dynamic sequencing. The cyclic sequencing category uses a ﬁxed cyclic schedule on
the production facility, while the lot sizes are varied to meet demand variations. The
cyclic schedule can, for example, be obtained from a deterministic model. A related
paper is Liu and Song (2012). Dynamic sequencing means that both the production

7.2
Production Smoothing
133
sequence and the lot sizes are varied. Examples of the cyclic sequencing approach are
Gallego (1990), Bowman and Muckstadt (1993, 1995), and Federgruen and Katalan
(1996, (1996). Papers considering dynamic sequencing are e.g., Graves (1980), and
Sox and Muckstadt (1987).
7.2.2
Time-Varying Demand
7.2.2.1
A Generalization of the Classical Dynamic Lot Size Problem
Recall the classical dynamic lot size problem in Sect. 4.5. In this section we shall
consider a generalization of this problem. Instead of a single item there are now N
items. Furthermore, these items are produced in the same machine, which has limited
capacity. (The generalization to several machines is relatively straightforward.) For
simplicity, it is assumed (as in Sect. 4.5) that all events take place in the beginning
of a period. A quantity that is produced in period t can therefore also be delivered to
customers in period t. The demands for different items are given but vary over time.
No backorders are allowed. (See e.g., Shapiro (1993) for a more detailed treatment
of the subject.) Let us introduce the following notation:
N

We wish to choose production quantities in different periods so that the sum of

We need the constraint (7.25) to enforce that production in a period implies that there
is a corresponding setup time and setup cost. If there is no upper bound on xi, t, we
can let Mi, t be very large. In the sequel it is assumed that this is the case.
Although the considered problem can be seen as a minor variation of the classical
dynamic lot size problem, the model is quite complex. If, for example N = 100 and
T = 12, there are 1200 integer variables and 2400 nonnegative continuous variables.
The number of constraints (7.23)–(7.25) is 2412.
A possible approach is to eliminate the capacity constraints (7.23) by a Lagrangian
relaxation. Let πt ≥0 be the multiplier for period t. We get the Lagrangean:

(7.27)
It is possible to show that the following proposition is true (Problem 7.7).
Proposition 7.3 For any nonnegative multipliers L ≤C.
Consider (7.27) together with the constraints (7.24)–(7.26). Because we have
eliminated the capacity constraint (7.23) we can determine L by optimizing each
item separately for certain given multipliers. For item i, the problem that we need to
solve is a generalized dynamic lot size problem (see Sect. 4.5) with a time-variable
setup cost Ai + aiπt and an additional time-variable production cost per unit biπt.
Also this more general problem is easy to solve, e.g., by dynamic programming.
If we want to get a tight lower bound for C we can solve the dual problem.
D =
max
π1,π2, ...,πT L.
(7.28)
In general, we will get a duality gap i.e., D < C because our MIP is nonconvex.A tight
lower bound is very useful, though. We can, for example, check whether a heuristic
feasible solution to the original problem gives a cost that is reasonably close to the
lower bound. In that case we know that the approximate solution is acceptable. Fur-
thermore, if we want to solve the original problem by a branch-and-bound procedure,
we can determine the needed associated lower bounds from the dual problem.
7.2.2.2
Application of Mathematical Programming Approaches
Recently there has been a renewed interest in mathematical programming mod-
els for production-inventory planning. One reason is that such models are quite

7.2

often included as so-called Advanced Planning Systems (APS) in modern Enter-
prise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. An overview of APS systems is given by
Fleischmann and Meyr (2003). ERP systems are discussed in Sect. 8.2.4.
As illustrated in Sect. 7.2.2.1, detailed models dealing with individual items are,
in general, quite complex due to nonlinear setup times and costs. Still, it is possible
to solve relatively large problems of this kind quite efﬁciently. Shapiro (1993) gives
an overview of these types of models. See also Billington et al. (1983) and Eppen
and Martin (1987).
One possibility to partly avoid the difﬁculties associated with setup times and
setup costs is to use a hierarchical planning procedure. This means that the planning
is carried out at two (or more) hierarchical levels. This is in line with standard indus-
trial planning procedures.At an upper level an aggregate problem is considered. This
problem concerns aggregate entities like product groups and machine groups. At the
lower level the aggregate plan is disaggregated into a detailed plan for individual
items and machines. The disaggregation is usually carried out by a simple heuris-
tic procedure. In a model representing the aggregate level, it is usually necessary
and reasonable to disregard the nonlinearities because they are associated with in-
dividual items. It is consequently possible to use linear programming. Furthermore,
the number of variables and constraints are reduced by considering product groups
and machine groups instead of individual items and machines. Therefore the model
becomes less complex.
An overview of hierarchical planning models is given by Bitran and Tirupati
(1993). See also the discussion of different planning concepts in De Kok and
Fransoo (2003).
7.2.3
Production Smoothing and Batch Quantities
In many situations it is not practical to smooth production by active coordination
of the replenishments. If, for example, the demands of different items are varying
substantially over time, it is difﬁcult to smooth production by using cyclic schedules.
It may still be an important goal to avoid excessive queues in production, though.
A remaining possibility is to try to adjust the batch quantities in order to obtain a
reasonably smooth load.
Many companies have found that smaller order quantities may smooth the pro-
duction load and reduce the queues in production. There is a simple explanation for
this. If the orders arriving to production can be seen as a stochastic process, smaller
batches will reduce the variations over time due to the laws of large numbers. The
load during a certain time is then built up of a larger number of smaller batches. If
the orders are more or less independent, this will clearly smooth the load. On the
other hand, we cannot use order quantities that are too small, since this will mean
that the setup times will take too much of the available capacity into account and
increase the queues. As usual, we have to ﬁnd a suitable middle way.

136

Coordinated Ordering
The models which we have dealt with in Chaps. 4, 5, and 6 do not address these
types of questions. In these models it is assumed that the lead-time is constant, or
that the lead-time distribution is given but independent of the batch quantity. But
from our discussion it is obvious that there are situations when this is not true and
the lot sizes strongly affect the lead-time distribution. There are some lot-sizing
models that explicitly take the queuing situation in production into account. We shall
consider a simple such model essentially according to Karmarkar (1987, 1993). See
also Axsäter (1980, 1986), Bertrand (1985), and Zipkin (1986).
Consider a machine in a large multi-center shop. This machine is used for
producing a number of similar items having the same batch size. We deﬁne
d =
average total demand for all items, units per time unit,
p =
average processing rate, units per time unit,
Q =
batch quantity for an item,
s =
setup time for a batch,
T =
average time in the system for a batch.
We shall, for simplicity, assume that the batches arrive at the machine as a Poisson
process with rate λ = d/Q. This is a reasonable approximation if there are relatively
many items. Let us also, for simplicity, think of the processing time as exponentially
distributed. The average processing time for a batch is 1/κ = s+Q/p and the service
factor ρ = λ/k = ds/Q+d/p. The average time in the considered (M/M/1) queuing
system is then
T = 1/κ
1 −ρ =
s + Q/p
1 −ds/Q −d/p.
(7.29)
Note that we must require ρ < 1, or equivalently, Q > ds/(1 −d/p), i.e., the cycle
time must on average accommodate both the setup time and the operation time.
By minimizing the average time in the system, T, with respect to Q, it is possible
to show that the minimum occurs for
Q =
ds
1 −d/p +
s√dp
1 −d/p.
(7.30)
The average time in the system is large both when using batch quantities that
are too small and when using batch quantities that are too large. When the batch
quantities are too small the setup times will require too much capacity. When the
batch quantities are too large the production time for a batch is long and there are also
more stochastic variations in the production load, which will cause longer queuing
times.
If we wish to minimize the sum of holding costs for work-in-process we should,
in the considered case, use Q according to (7.30). However, there are also other
objectives when choosing the batch size. For example, there are holding costs for
stocks of completed items. There may also be ordering costs. The holding costs
for completed items are clearly affected by the replenishment lead-time. We can
see (7.29) as the lead-time (or part of the lead-time) when modeling the stocks of

7.3
Joint Replenishments
137
completed items. (This means that we disregard that the lead-time is stochastic.)
Doing so, we can include holding costs for both work-in-process and the stocks of
completed items in the same model when determining batch quantities and reorder
points.
Note that the average time in the system for a batch is, in steady state, not affected
by the reorder points for completed items.
7.3
Joint Replenishments
In Sect. 7.2 we have considered situations where we want to have orders for different
items spread out over time in order to get a smooth production load. In this section we
shall deal with the opposite problem, i.e., we shall consider a group of items which
should be replenished jointly as much as possible. As we have discussed previously,
there are several possible reasons for joint replenishments, for example, joint setup
costs, quantity discounts, coordinated transports, etc.
The methods for determination of batch quantities and reorder points that we have
dealt with in Chaps. 4, 5, and 6 are evidently not directly applicable in case of joint
replenishments. If there is a joint setup cost, for example, we wish to have a total order
size that is sufﬁciently large while the individual lot sizes may be of less importance.
We would also like to choose the batch sizes such that we have reasonable possibilities
to coordinate future orders. Furthermore, we can normally not use reorder points
that have been determined individually. Assume that the individual reorder points
correspond to a certain service level that we would like to maintain. If we make a
joint replenishment as soon as one of the items reaches its reorder point, other items
will be ordered too early. This means that the service level (and the holding costs)
will be higher than what was intended.
7.3.1
A Deterministic Model
A common way of modeling joint replenishment problems is to assume that there are
two types of ordering or setup costs: individual setup costs for each item, and a joint
setup cost for the whole group of items. The joint setup cost does not depend on the
number of items that are ordered. We shall ﬁrst consider such a model with constant
continuous demand. No backorders are allowed. The cycle times, or equivalently the
batch quantities, are constant. The production time can be disregarded. We can also
without any lack of generality disregard the lead-times, provided they are the same
for all items. Let us introduce the following notation:
N =
number of items,
hi =
holding cost per unit and time unit for item i,
A =
setup cost for the group,
ai =
setup cost for item i,

138
7
Coordinated Ordering
di =
demand per time unit for item i,
Ti =
cycle time for item i.
The problem is to determine cycle times in order to minimize the sum of holding and
setup costs. Given a cycle time Ti, the corresponding batch quantity Qi is obtained
as Qi = Tidi. To simplify the notation we shall replace the holding costs hi by
ηi = hidi, and set all demands equal to one. It is easy to check that this will not
change the problem. (See Problem 7.12.) Furthermore, we assume for simplicity, that
the items are ordered so that a1/η1 ≤a2η2 ≤. . . ≤aN/ηN. We shall consider two
approaches to solve the problem. The ﬁrst approach is a simple iterative technique.
The second one is based on Roundy’s 98 % approximation.
7.3.1.1
Approach 1. An Iterative Technique
If there were no joint setup cost the optimal cycle times could be determined by the
classical economic lot size formula as:
Ti =

2ai
ηi
,
(7.31)
i.e., T1 would be the smallest cycle time. A natural approach to solving the problem
is therefore to assume that the cycle times of items 2, 3,. . ., N are integer multiples
ni of the cycle time for item 1, or equivalently,
Ti = niT1,
i = 2,3, . . ., N.
(7.32)
Our objective is then to minimize the total costs per time unit,
C =
A + a1 +
N
i=2
ai/ni
T1
+
T1(η1 +
N
i=2
ηini)

,
(7.33)
with respect to T1, n2, n3, . . ., nN.
Given n2, n3, . . ., nN, the optimal T1 and the corresponding costs are obtained as:
T ∗
1 (n2, n3, ..., nN) =
&
'
'
'
'

'
(
2(A + a1 +

C∗(n2, n3, ..., nN) =
&
'
'
(2(A + a1 +
N

i=2
ai/ni)(η1 +
N

i=2
ηini).
(7.35)
Note that T ∗
1 is not chosen according to (7.31).

7.3
Joint Replenishments
139
If we disregard that n2, n3, . . ., nN have to be integers and optimize the costs
(7.35), it is possible to show (Problem 7.13) that:
ni =
ai
ηi
η1
(A + a1).
(7.36)
Inserting (7.36) in (7.35) we get the following lower bound for the costs:
C =

2(A + a1)η1 +
N

i=2

2aiηi.
(7.37)
The lower bound (7.37) can also be understood in the following way. Assume that
there is no joint setup cost but that the individual setup cost for item 1 is A + a1. If
we optimize each item separately we obtain the total costs (7.37). But the considered
problem is clearly a relaxation of the original problem since we can have setups of
items 2, 3,. . ., N without any joint setup cost. Consequently (7.37) is a lower bound
for the total costs.
We are now ready to formulate a heuristic for the original problem where
n2, n3, . . ., nN are integers.
1. Determine start values of n2, n3, . . ., nN by rounding (7.36) to the closest positive
integers.
2. Determine the corresponding T1 from (7.34).
3. Given T1, minimize (7.33) with respect to n2, n3, . . ., nN. This means that we are
choosing ni as the smallest positive integer satisfying:
ni(ni + 1) ≥2ai
ηiT 2
1
.
(7.38)
Return to Step 2 if any multiplier ni has changed since the last iteration.
Since the procedure gives an improvement in each step it will obviously converge,
but not necessarily to the optimal solution. The resulting costs can be compared to
the lower bound (7.37).
Example 7.2 Consider N = 4 items with a joint setup cost A = 300. The individual
setup costs are a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = 50, and the holding costs are h1 = h2 = h3 =
h4 = 10. The demands per time unit are d1 = 5000, d2 = 1000, d3 = 700, and d4 =
100. Note that in this case ηi = hidi = 10di. As requested, ai/ηi is nondecreasing
with i. When applying the heuristic we obtain:
1. n2 =

50
1000 · 10
5000 · 10
350
≈1, n3 ≈1, n4 ≈3.
2. T1 =

2 · (350 + 50 + 50 + 50/3)
10 · 5000 + 10 · 1000 + 10 · 700 + 10 · 100 · 3 = 0.1155.
3. We again obtain the multipliers n2 = 1, n3 = 1, n4 = 3, i.e., the algorithm has
already converged.

140
7
Coordinated Ordering
We get the resulting costs from (7.35) as C = 8082.9, which can be compared to the
lower bound according to (7.37) C = 8069.0.
Related procedures are described in e.g., Goyal and Satir (1989), and Silver et al.
(1998). A technique for ﬁnding a solution with an arbitrarily small deviation from
the optimal value is given by Wildeman et al. (1997).
7.3.1.2
Approach 2. Roundy’s 98 % Approximation
We shall now look for a solution where the joint setups have cycle time T0 ≥0, and
all other cycle times are nonnegative powers-of-two times T0, i.e.,
Ti = 2kiT0,
i = 1, 2, ..., N
(7.39)
where ki is a nonnegative integer. Using the notation a0 =A, and η0 = 0, we can
express our objective as:
min
T0,T1, ...,TN
N

i=0

ηi
Ti
2 + ai
1
Ti

,
(7.40)
subject to the constraints (7.39). This means that we let the joint setups be represented
by a ﬁctive item 0.
Let us now relax the considered problem by replacing (7.39) by
Ti ≥T0
i = 1, 2, ..., N.
(7.41)
It is a relaxation because (7.39) implies (7.41) while the opposite is not true. The
resulting solution will therefore give a lower bound for the costs.
Consider the relaxed problem, i.e., (7.40), with respect to the constraints (7.41).
Since the objective function is convex and the constraints are linear, we can get the
solution from the following Lagrangean relaxation:
max
λ1,λ2, ...,λN

N

i=1
λi,
η′
1 = η1 −2λ1,
...
η′
N = ηN −2λN.
(7.43)
It is easy to see that the optimal solution must have all η′
i > 0. Otherwise Ti →∞,
which is obviously not optimal.

(7.44)
without any constraints on the cycle times, i.e., we have N + 1 independent classical
lot sizing problems.
Let us now go back to the original joint replenishment problem but with cost
parameters ai and η′
i. Consider the effect of λi con the holding costs. The holding
cost of item i is reduced by 2λi and the holding cost of item 0 is increased by 2λi. This
will mean a cost reduction for any solution of the joint replenishment problem, even
if we allow the periods between orders to vary over time. To see this, consider the
period between two orders for item i > 0. If there are additional joint setups between
the two orders the total holding costs during the considered period will decrease,
otherwise they will be the same.
Butgiventhecostparametersai andη′
i, (7.44)willobviouslyprovidetheminimum
cost since no constraints are considered. The optimal solution of the relaxed problem
will consequently give a lower bound for the costs of any solution. This bound is
tighter than (7.37) because of the constraints (7.41).
Assume that we have solved the relaxed problem. We can then adjust this solution
by rounding the cycle times so that they can be expressed as:
Ti = 2miq
(7.45)
for some number q > 0. We know from Proposition 7.1 in Sect. 7.1 that if q is given,
the maximum cost increase is at most 6 %, and if we can also adjust q to get a better
approximation, the cost increase is at most 2 % according to Proposition 7.2. Due to
(7.41), we know that mi ≥m0 and the cycle times obtained must consequently satisfy
(7.39). We have now obtained Roundy’s solution of the problem. This solution has
an important quality. The cost increase compared to the optimal solution is at most
2 %, since it is at most 2 % compared to the lower bound (7.44).
It is possible to use the considered Lagrangean relaxation for numerical determi-
nation of Roundy’s solution, but in general, it is much simpler to use the following
technique. Since the items are ordered so that ai/ηi are nondecreasing with i for i > 0,
it is obvious from (7.40) and (7.41) that the optimal cycle times in the relaxed problem
are nondecreasing with i for i > 0. It is also clear that we must have T1 = T0 in the
optimal solution of the relaxed problem because a0 =A, and η0 = 0. This means that
Ti ≥Ti−1,
i = 1, 2, ..., N.
(7.46)
Consider the relaxed problem with (7.41) replaced by (7.46). This will not change
the optimal solution. Without the constraints (7.46) it would be optimal to use
T ∗
i = (2ai/ηi)1/2 for all i. Consequently, if ai/ηi is increasing with i, we have found
the optimal solution since the resulting batch quantities will satisfy (7.46). Since
η0 = 0 this is never the case initially. Assume that for some i, ai/ηi < ai−1/ηi−1,
or equivalently that T ∗
i
< T ∗
i−1. Assume furthermore that in the optimal solution

142
7
Coordinated Ordering
Ti > Ti −1. Because of the convexity this implies that Ti ≤T ∗
i since we would
otherwise reduce Ti, and similarly that Ti−1 ≥T ∗
i−1 since we would otherwise in-
crease Ti −1. But this means that Ti < Ti −1 which is a contradiction. Consequently,
Ti = Ti −1 in the optimal solution of the relaxed problem. But this implies that we
can aggregate items i −1 and i into a single item with cost parameters ai −1 + ai,
and ηi−1 +ηi. Next we consider the resulting reduced problem with one item less. If
ai/ηi < ai−1/ηi−1 for some i we can aggregate the two items, otherwise we obtain
the optimal solution from the classical economic lot size model, etc.
Since η0 = 0 we will always aggregate items 0 and 1. After aggregation we
have an item with cost parameters A + a1 and η1. Next we check whether a2/η2 <
(A + a1) /η1. If this is the case the aggregate item should include also item 2, etc.
When no more aggregations are possible, we can optimize the resulting aggregate
items individually.
Example 7.3 Consider the same data as in Example 7.2, i.e., N = 4, A = 300, a1 =
a2 = a3 = a4 = 50, η1 = 50,000, η2 = 10,000, η3 = 7000, and η4 = 1000.
To solve the relaxed problem we ﬁrst aggregate items 0 and 1. The combined
item has cost parameters A + a1 = 350, and η0 + η1 = 50,000. Consider then item
2. Since a2/η2 = 50/10,000 < 350/50,000, item 2 should also be added to the com-
bined item. The resulting cost parameters are obtained as A + a1 + a2 = 400, and
η0 + η1 + η2 = 60,000. Consider item 3. Since 50/7000 > 400/60,000, item 3 should
not be added. Compare ﬁnally item 4 and item 3. We get 50/1000 > 50/7000, i.e.,
items 3 and 4 should not be combined. This gives the cycle times T0 = T1 = T2 =
(800/60,000)1/2 = 0.1155, T3 = (100/7000)1/2 = 0.1195, and T4 = (100/1000)1/2 =
0.3162. The resulting lower bound for the costs is C = C0 + 1 + 2 + C3 + C4 =
6928.2 + 836.7 + 316.2 = 8081.1. Note that this bound is better than the bound
obtained in Example 7.2.
Consider then cycle times that can be expressed as powers of two, i.e., let q = 1
in (7.45). We obtain T0 = T1 = T2 = 2−3 = 0.125, T3 = 2−3 = 0.125, and T4 = 2−2 =
0.250. The resulting costs are C = C0 + 1 + 2 + C3 + C4 = 6950 + 837.5 + 325 =
8112.5, i.e., 0.39 % above the lower bound.
By minimization of (7.10) it is possible to show that it is optimal to have q =
1.88 in (7.45). The corresponding cycle times are T0 = T1 = T2 = 2−4q = 0.1175,
T3 = 2−4q = 0.1175, and T4 = 2−3q = 0.235. The resulting costs are C = C0 + 1 + 2 +
C3+C4 = 6929.3 + 836.8 + 330.3 = 8096.3, i.e., 0.19 % above the lower bound. The
solution in Example 7.2, which is not a powers-of-two policy, is still slightly better.
A similar approach is used for multi-stage lot sizing in Sect. 9.2.2. See also Jackson
et al. (1985), Roundy (1985, 1986), and Muckstadt and Roundy (1993).
The two approaches considered assume constant demand, but can also be used in
case of stochastic demand. We then replace the stochastic demands by their means
when determining cycle times. Given the cycle times we can, using the techniques
in Sect. 5.12, determine appropriate periodic review S policies for each item. The
order-up-toinventorypositionsshouldincludesuitableamountsofsafetystock. Next,
in Sect. 7.3.2, we will consider a different model that is more directly focused on
stochastic demand.

A Stochastic Model
We shall now instead consider a stochastic model. The demands for the items are
independent and stationary stochastic processes. Each customer demand is for an
integralnumberofunits.Wecan, forexample, considerPoissonorcompoundPoisson

b1,i =

Viswanathan (1997) suggests the following technique that, in his numerical tests,
outperforms other suggested methods.
In the ﬁrst step we disregard the joint setup cost and consider the items individually
for a suitable grid of review periods T. For each review period we determine the
optimal individual (s, S) policies for all items and the corresponding average costs.
This can be done very efﬁciently as explained in Sect. 6.1.1.2 Let
Ci (T) = average costs per time unit for item i when using the optimal individual
(s, S) policy with a review interval of T time units.
In the second step we determine the review period T by minimizing,
C(T ) = A/T +
N

i=1
Ci(T ).
(7.47)
Note that the actual costs are lower than the costs according to (7.47), since the major
setup cost A is not incurred at reviews where none of the items are ordered.
Atkins and Iyogun (1988) also use periodic review policies but in a different way.
Other policies that have been used frequently in the inventory literature are so-
called can-order policies. When using such a policy there are two reorder points for
each item: a can-order level and a lower must-order level. An item must be ordered
when its inventory position reaches the must-order level. When an item in the group
is ordered, other items with inventory positions at or below their respective can-order
levels are also ordered. This type of policy was ﬁrst suggested by Balintfy (1964).
Techniques for designing can-order policies have been suggested by Silver (1981)
and Federgruen et al. (1984).
Renberg and Planche (1967) suggested a so-called (Si, Q) policy. According to
this policy all items are replenished up to certain levels Si when the total demand for
the whole group since the preceding replenishment has reached Q.

Multi-Echelon Systems: Structures
and Ordering Policies
So far we have considered a single installation. In practice, though, it is also common
to see multi-stage, or multi-echelon, inventory systems, where a number of installa-
tions are coupled to each other. For example, when distributing products over large
geographical areas, many companies use an inventory system with a central ware-
house close to the production facility and a number of local stocking points close to
the customers in different areas. Similarly, in production, stocks of raw materials,
components, and ﬁnished products are coupled to each other. To obtain efﬁcient
control of such inventory systems it is necessary to use special methods that take
the connection between different stocks into account. In Chaps. 8–10 we will show
when and how such methods can be used.
The interest in Supply Chain Management in general, and for multi-echelon in-
ventory control in such chains, is growing rapidly. The management of multi-echelon
inventory systems is a crucial part of supply chain operations. Furthermore, the pos-
sibilities for efﬁcient control of multi-echelon inventory systems have increased sub-
stantially during the last two decades. One reason is the progress in research, which
has resulted in new techniques that are both more general and more efﬁcient.Another
reason is new information technologies which have created a completely different
infrastructure and greatly increased the possibilities for efﬁcient supply chain coor-
dination. Examples of such new technologies are EDI (Electronic Data Interchange),
satellite communication systems, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation).
Multi-echelon inventory systems in supply chains are not always part of a single
company. Quiteoften, differentcompaniesworktogethertoimprovethecoordination

Inventory Systems in Distribution and Production
Multi-echelon inventory systems are common in both distribution and production.
When analyzing such systems it is important to understand that inventory systems
which may physically appear to be very different can still be very similar in an
inventory control context. Consider for example the two installations in Fig. 8.1.

The customer demand takes place at installation 1. Installation 1 is replenished from
installation 2, which in turn, replenishes from an outside supplier.
In a distribution system, installation 1 can be a local sales stock in a distant country,
while installation 2 is a central warehouse close to the factory. The replenishment
lead-time at installation 1 is then essentially the transportation time.
In production, installation 1 may be the stock of a ﬁnal product while installation
2 is the stock of a subassembly which is used when producing the ﬁnal product. In
this case the stocks contain different items, yet the coupling is the same. In both
situations installation 1 can be seen as a customer at installation 2. In the production
situation the replenishment lead-time at installation 1 is essentially the production
time, and the two stocks may very well be situated in the same building.
8.1.1
Distribution Inventory Systems
Distribution inventory systems are, in general, divergent, i.e., the number of parallel
installations increase along the material ﬂow. In a pure distribution system, or ar-
borescent system, each stock has at most a single immediate predecessor. Figure 8.2
shows such a system with two levels: a central warehouse, and a number of retailers.
In the special case when each installation has also at most one immediate
successor, as in Fig. 8.1, we have a serial system.
The stocks at the retailers in Fig. 8.2 are needed to maintain a high service at
different local markets. The central warehouse supports all retailers. More stock at the
central warehouse will give shorter and less variable lead-times for the retailers, and
this can enable the retailers to reduce their stocks. On the other hand, the holding costs
at the central warehouse will increase. The best distribution of the total system stock
will depend on the structure of the system, the demand variations, the transportation

times, and the unit costs. Situations exist when there should be a relatively large stock
at the central warehouse, but it is more common that the optimal solution means a
very low warehouse stock, much lower than what most practitioners would expect.
8.1.2
Production Inventory Systems
Inventory systems in production may also sometimes have a structure like that in
Fig. 8.2. Such systems are especially common in process industries, but also occur
quite frequently at the end of the production chain in mechanical industries. The
central warehouse in Fig. 8.2 can then correspond to the stock of a subassembly that
is used as a basic module when producing a number of different end products. The
stocks of these end products correspond to the retailer stocks in Fig. 8.2.
In production it is more common, though, to have inventory systems with many
parallel stocking locations early in the material ﬂow and successively fewer stocks
later in the ﬂow, i.e., a convergent ﬂow. If each installation has at most one immediate
successor, as in Fig. 8.3, we have an assembly system. Note that a serial system is
also a special case of an assembly system.
For an assembly system there also exist various reasons for keeping stock early
in the material ﬂow. Raw materials and components early in the ﬂow usually have
much lower values than subassemblies and ﬁnal products at the end of the ﬂow.
This means that the holding costs are lower. Sometimes high setup costs in early
production stages may also make it necessary to use large batch quantities.
It is, in general, considerably easier to deal with serial systems than with other
types of multi-echelon systems. Some results for serial systems however, can be
generalized to pure distribution systems or assembly systems. In production it is
very common, though, to also encounter more general inventory systems which are
much more difﬁcult to handle. Figure 8.4 shows such a system. Note that a facility
can have several successors as well as several predecessors.
For a certain multi-echelon inventory system in production there exists an equiva-
lent bill of material, or product structure. In Fig. 8.4, stock 1 can be seen as the stock
of a ﬁnal product that is produced from items 2 and 3. Item 2 is produced from items 4
and 5 etc. The complete bill of material corresponding to Fig. 8.4 is shown in Fig. 8.5.

In production, it is also common that we need more than one unit of a component
when producing some other item. For example, item 1 may consist of two units of
item 2 and three units of item 3. For serial and assembly systems this does not add
to the complexity. Since an item can only be part of a single item we can always
redeﬁne the unit so that we always need exactly one unit of a lower level item. If,
for example, a certain item contains two units of some other item, we can let two
units of this item be the new unit. But we cannot handle a general system in this way.
To see this, consider again Fig. 8.5. It may happen that item 2 contains two units of
item 5 while item 3 contains three units of the same item. We cannot circumvent this
difﬁculty by redeﬁning the unit.
8.1.3
Repairable Items
In this book we deal with consumable items. However, it is interesting to note that
repairable items can in many situations be handled in essentially the same way.
Some of the early important work concerning multi-echelon inventory systems (e.g.,
Sherbrooke 1968) was focused on repairable items, which are especially common in
military applications.
To illustrate the relationship between consumable and repairable items, consider
again Fig. 8.2. Assume that the stocks contain repairable spare items which can

8.1

151
Fig. 8.6 Lateral

replace items that fail. Furthermore, assume that all replenishments are one-for-one.
When an item fails it is sent to the central site for repair. It is then stocked at the
central site. The failed item is, if possible, replaced by another item at the local site.
If no item is available, the item is backordered. In any case a new item is ordered
from the central site. Consider then a corresponding system with consumable items.
The only difference is the warehouse lead-time. In the case of consumable items,
this lead-time is given or has a given distribution. In the case of repairable items,
the corresponding warehouse lead-time is the transportation time from a local site
plus the repair time. By using this equivalence we can use models and techniques
for consumable items for repairable items as well.
A review of repairable item inventory control is given by Nahmias (1981).
8.1.4
Lateral Transshipments in Inventory Systems
Consider again the distribution inventory system in Fig. 8.2. We can say that the
advantage of the central warehouse is that it enables pooling of stock. The stock in
the warehouse can be used by any of the retailers. But pooling of stock can also
be obtained by other inventory systems. One possibility is to use so-called lateral
transshipments between parallel local stock points. Consider Fig. 8.6.
The local stocks normally replenish from an outside supplier, for example by
applying (R, Q) policies. But in emergency situations it is also possible to use lateral
transshipments between adjacent retailers. These transshipments are faster but incur
additional costs. Such lateral transshipments are common in practice. Models with
lateral transshipments are usually more difﬁcult to handle, and the available results
are less general.
There are two problems associated with lateral transshipments:
1. What is a suitable decision rule for deciding on the source and size of a lateral
transshipment?
2. Given a certain decision rule for lateral transshipments, how can this policy be
evaluated and how does it affect the policy for normal replenishments?
Many of the earlier papers dealing with lateral transshipments consider the second
problem and assume that some simple decision rule is given. A frequent assumption
is that a demand at a local stock point that can not be met by stock on hand is,

if possible, supplied by a lateral transshipment from some other stock point with

Dada (1992), Alfredsson and Verrijdt (1999), Grahovac and Chakravarty (2001),
Kukreja et al. (2001), Sherbrooke (1992), Muckstadt (2005), and Vidgren (2005).
A possible approach when trying to optimize decisions concerning lateral trans-
shipments (Problem 1) is to use stochastic dynamic programming. See e.g., Das
(1975), Robinson (1990), Archibald et al. (1997), and Olsson (2005). Tagaras and
Cohen (1992) evaluate different decision rules by simulation. Given the policy for
normal replenishments, the decision rule in Axsäter (2003) provides a performance
guarantee; it will always lead to an improvement compared to not using lateral trans-
shipments. Another heuristic decision rule is suggested by Minner et al. (2003).
Rudi et al. (2001) consider decentralized decisions concerning transshipments and
determine transshipment prices that lead to joint-proﬁt maximization. We shall not
discuss lateral transshipments any further in this book.
Problems concerning transshipments are related to problems with substitutions.
See e.g., Bassok et al. (1999) and the references therein for a further discussion of
such problems.
Another related problem area is emergency deliveries (from the supplier) in an in-
ventory system. See e.g., Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988), Johansen andThorstenson
(1998), Minner (2003), and Axsäter (2005).
8.1.5
Inventory Models with Remanufacturing
It has become more and more common to use production-inventory systems where
manufacturing and remanufacturing operations occur simultaneously. For example,
it may be possible to process used components of certain products so that they satisfy
the same quality standards as new components. This means that new components
can be replaced by remanufactured used components when available. See Fig. 8.7.
There are several motivations for such manufacturing systems. One important
reason is new regulations that force manufacturing companies to collect and handle

8.2
Different Ordering Systems
153
used products after customer usage.Another reason is that remanufacturing processes
tend to become more competitive.
Remanufacturing policies will lead to inventory systems with coupled inventories.
The demands as well as the returns are usually stochastic processes. It is obvious that
the control of the system in Fig. 8.7 involves many complex questions. For example,
what does a suitable production strategy look like, and how much safety stock is
needed in the two stocks?
The literature dealing with such inventory models is growing rapidly. See e.g.,
Van der Laan et al. (1998), Van der Laan et al. (1999), Guide et al. (2003), Dekker
et al. (2004), and the references therein.
8.2
Different Ordering Systems
For a single-echelon system we know that an (s, S) policy is optimal under very
general conditions. Some optimality results exist for serial systems, see Clark and
Scarf (1960), Chen (2000), and Muharremoglu and Tsitsiklis (2003). But for most
multi-echelon systems the structure of the optimal policy is unknown. Generally we
can expect an optimal control policy for a multi-echelon inventory system to be quite
complex.An optimaldecisiontosendabatchfromonesitetoanothersitemaydepend
on the inventory status at all sites. Such a centralized decision system is usually
associated with several disadvantages. A lot of information is needed and although
information technology has improved dramatically, the data movement will lead to
additional costs. Furthermore, completely general centralized policies are difﬁcult to
derive. It is therefore usually more suitable to limit the degree of centralization and
use relatively simple local control rules that are similar to policies used in single-
echelon systems. Multi-level methods mean then that we try to coordinate such local
decision rules in a suitable way. It is common to use simple reorder point policies
in multi-echelon inventory systems, for example. Our problem may then be to ﬁnd
reorder points for the different facilities that will give a satisfactory coordinating
control of the system as a whole.
The need to decentralize the control is generally larger in a distribution system than
in a production system. Within distribution, different facilities are normally situated
at locations far from each other, and quite often relatively independent organizational
units make the replenishment decisions.
Also for multi-echelon systems we can choose between continuous review and
periodic review. In Sect. 7.2 we have discussed the possibility of using periodic
review systems in order to smooth the production load. This is, of course, also a
possibility when dealing with multi-echelon inventory systems. Furthermore, there
can be other similar reasons for using periodic review in connection with multi-
echelon systems. Consider, for example, the distribution system in Fig. 8.2. If the
four retailers use periodic review systems with a review period of 4 weeks, and with
different ordering weeks, the demand at the central warehouse will be very smooth.
This will simplify the inventory control and also lead to a smooth production load in
the factory delivering to the warehouse.

Multi-Echelon Systems: Structures and Ordering Policies
In this section we will describe different common ordering systems and show
how they are related to each other. The ordering systems are all quite simple, but
regardless of which ordering system we choose, it is difﬁcult to determine suitable
control parameters like batch quantities and safety stocks. We shall deal with these
questions in Chaps. 9 and 10.
8.2.1
Installation Stock Reorder Point Policies and KANBAN
Policies
One common way to control a multi-echelon inventory system is to control each
facility by an (R, Q) policy or by an S policy. Recall that for discrete integral demand
an S policy is a special case of an (R, Q) policy where R = S −1 and Q = 1. The
reorder points and batch quantities do not, of course, need to be the same for dif-
ferent facilities. As we have described in Sect. 3.2.3, each facility considers its own
inventory position, i.e., stock on hand plus outstanding orders and minus backorders.
When the inventory position declines to or below R, a batch of size Q (or possibly a
number of batches) is ordered so that the new inventory position is above R and less
or equal to R + Q.
As we shall describe in Sect. 8.2.2, it is also common to use a different type of
reorder point policy in multi-echelon inventory systems. When using this modiﬁed
reorder point policy, the inventory position is deﬁned in another way and not based
only on the stock at the installation. To avoid misinterpretation the normal (R, Q)
policy is therefore often denoted installation stock (R, Q) policy in connection with
multi-echelon inventory control.
As pointed out above, the optimality of the (s, S) policy for single-echelon systems
does not, in general, carry over to multi-echelon systems. Therefore it is more com-
mon to let the installations use the somewhat simpler (R, Q) policy in a multi-echelon
setting.
It is also common to apply KANBAN policies in multi-echelon systems. As
described in Sect. 3.2.3.1, a KANBAN policy can be interpreted as an installation
stock (R, Q) policy where backorders are not subtracted from the inventory position.
This means that the number of KANBANs is an upper bound for the number of
outstanding orders and will limit work-in-process, which is sometimes an advantage,
see Veatch and Wein (1994) and Spearman et al. (1990).
8.2.2
Echelon Stock Reorder Point Policies
Consider the inventory system and the corresponding product structures in Fig. 8.8.
We use a number in parenthesis to illustrate the number of units contained in
the higher level item. For example, 2 units of item 4 are used as components when
producing one unit of item 2. Similarly, 3 units of item 4 are needed when producing
one unit of item 3.

Consider the stock of item 4. If the inventory position is low, it is clearly an
indication that we might need to replenish. But on the other hand, if the stocks of
items 1, 2, and 3 are very high, there is no immediate need for more units of item 4
and it may not be necessary to replenish. The idea of using the echelon stock is to
take this into account by also including downstream stock of an item. This means that
we also add units of item 4 contained in the inventory positions of items 1, 2 and 3
when deciding whether to replenish item 4. This strategy does not always work well,
though. Assume that the stock of item 3 is very high, while the stocks of items 1 and
2 are low. The echelon stock of item 4 may then be very high, and no replenishment
is triggered even though the stocks of items 1 and 2 need to be replenished. The
replenishments of item 2 will cause corresponding demands for item 4. The problem
is that these demands cannot be covered by the stock of item 3.
We shall explain the echelon stock concept in detail by an example.
Example 8.1
Consider the inventory system in Fig. 8.8 and assume installation
inventory positions as in the second column of Table 8.1.
Items 1 and 3 have no downstream stock. The echelon stock inventory positions
are therefore the same as the installation stock inventory positions. Consider item 2.
Since each unit of item 1 contains one unit of item 2, the echelon stock inventory
position of item 2 is obtained as the installation inventory position plus the stock
included in the inventory position of item 1, i.e., 2 + 5 = 7 units. Item 4 is part of
items 1, 2, and 3. Each unit of items 1 and 2 contains two units of item 4 and each unit
of item 3 contains three units. Consequently we obtain the echelon stock inventory
position of item 4 as 5+2·5+2·2+3·3 = 28Alternatively, we can use the echelon
stock positions of items 2 and 3 to obtain the same result, i.e., 5 + 2 · 7 + 3 · 3 = 28.
Since the echelon stock inventory position is normally higher than the installation
stock inventory position, an echelon stock reorder point policy will generally use
larger reorder points than an installation stock policy to achieve similar control.

Fig. 8.9 Serial inventory system with N installations
Note that if the number of units contained in a higher level item is always one, the
echelon stock inventory position is simply obtained as the installation stock inventory
position plus the sum of the installation inventory positions of all downstream items.
This is always the case in a distribution system where all stocks contain the same
item. Recall also that we can always obtain this situation when dealing with serial
or assembly systems by a suitable change of units.
8.2.3
Comparison of Installation Stock and Echelon
Stock Policies
We shall now consider the serial inventory system in Fig. 8.9. Item 1 is the ﬁnal
product facing customer demand. Item N is raw material obtained from an outside
supplier. When producing item n (1 ≤n ≤N – 1) we need one unit of item n + 1.
We shall analyze the relationship between installation stock (R, Q) policies and
echelon stock (R, Q) policies. The batch quantities are assumed to be given and the
same for both policies,
Qn =
batch quantity at installation n
We make the additional assumption that the batch quantity at installation n is an
integer multiple of the batch quantity at installation n– 1 (it is convenient to deﬁne
Q0 = 1), i.e.,
Qn = jnQn−1,
(8.1)
where jn is a positive integer. This assumption is natural if the rationing policy is to
satisfy all or nothing of an order, since the installation stock at installation n should
then always consist of an integer number of the next downstream lot size Qn−1.
Let us now introduce some additional notation:
IPi
n =
installation inventory position at installation n
IPe
n =
IPi
n +IPi
n−1 +. . .+IPi
1 = echelon stock inventory position at installation n
Ri
n =

We shall assume that the system starts with initial inventory positions IPi0
n and IPe0
n
satisfying:
Ri
n < IPi0
n ≤Ri
n + Qn,
Re
n < IPe0
n ≤Re
n + Qn.
(8.2)

8.2
Different Ordering Systems
157
Note that these conditions are always satisﬁed as soon as each installation has ordered
at least once.
Let us now make some observations.An installation stock policy is always nested,
i.e., installation n will not order unless its inventory position has just been reduced by
an order from installation n – 1. But if installation n – 1 orders, this must then also be
the case for installation n – 2 etc., and consequently for all downstream installations.
The echelon stock inventory position at installation n is not affected by orders
at installations 1, 2, . . ., n – 1. If, for example, installation n – 1 orders a batch
from installation n, IPi
n−1 is increased by Qn−1 and IPi
n is reduced by Qn −1. This
will clearly not affect IPe
n. The echelon stock inventory position at installation n is
only changed by the ﬁnal demand at installation 1 and by replenishment orders at
installation n.
We shall now prove Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 below for the special case of unit
demand and continuous review. The propositions are also valid for other types of
demand and for periodic review. They can furthermore be extended to assembly
systems. See Axsäter and Rosling (1993) .
We shall also, without any lack of generality, assume that IPi0
n −Ri
n is an integer
multiple of Qn −1.All demands at installation n are for multiples of the batch quantity
at installation n – 1, Qn−1, and all replenishments are also multiples of Qn −1 due
to (8.1). Therefore this assumption simply means that we will hit the reorder point
exactly when ordering. The reorder point Ri
n + y, where 1 ≤y < Qn −1, will trigger
orders at the same times and inventory positions. The only difference is that the
inventory position will be y units below the reorder point when ordering because the
reorder point is y units higher.
Proposition 8.1 An installation stock reorder point policy can always be replaced
by an equivalent echelon stock reorder point policy.
proof Assume that the installation stock policy is given. Consider installation n.
Since the installation stock policy is nested, and since we have chosen the reorder
points such that all inventory positions will hit the reorder points exactly when orders
are triggered, the echelon stock inventory position just after ordering must be:
IPe
n =
n

k=1
(Ri
k + Qk).
(8.3)
Because of the unit demand, the echelon stock inventory position is reduced by one
unit at a time. Consequently, the orders will be triggered at exactly the same times
as with the installation stock policy if we use an echelon stock policy with reorder
points:
Re
n = Ri
n +
n−1

k=1
(Ri
k + Qk).
(8.4)
This proves the proposition.

158

Multi-Echelon Systems: Structures and Ordering Policies
If the condition that IPi0
n −Ri
n is a multiple of Qn−1 is not satisﬁed, we ﬁrst have
to change to an equivalent Ri
n satisfying the condition. After that we can apply (8.4)
to get the equivalent echelon stock policy. Note that Proposition 1 concerns only the
inventory positions. Consequently, the result is not affected by the lead-times.
Under the same assumptions we shall also prove:
Proposition 8.2 An echelon stock reorder point policy which is nested can always
be replaced by an equivalent installation stock reorder point policy.
proof Let the echelon stock policy be given. For installation 1 there is no difference
between an echelon stock and an installation stock policy. Consequently, Ri
1 = Re
1
will trigger orders at the same times as the echelon stock policy. Consider installation
n > 1. Due to the unit demand, all installations will always hit their reorder points
exactly when ordering. Since the policy is nested we know that if installation n
orders, installations 1, 2, . . ., n – 1 will also order. Immediately after ordering, the
installation inventory position at installation n is:
IPi
n = IPe
n −IPe
n−1 = Re
n + Qn −Re
n−1 −Qn−1.
(8.5)
Consequently, an installation stock policy with reorder points
Ri
1 = Re
1,
Ri
n = Re
n −Re
n−1 −Qn−1
n > 1,
(8.6)
will trigger orders at the same times as the echelon stock policy. (Note that (8.6) is
equivalent to (8.4).) This completes the proof.
Example 8.2 Consider a serial system with N = 3 installations and batch quantities
Q1 = 5, Q2 = 10, and Q3 = 20. Assume that the initial inventory positions are: IPi0
1 =
10, IPi0
2 = 20, and IPi0
3 = 30. Assume furthermore that the demand for item 1 is
one unit per time unit. Consider ﬁrst an installation stock policy with reorder points:
Ri
1 = 5, Ri
2 = 10, and Ri
3 = 10. Note that our assumptions that Qn as well as
IPi0
n −Ri
n are multiples of Qn−1 are satisﬁed. It is easy to check that installation
1 will order at times 5, 10, 15, . . . The demand at installation 2 is consequently 5
units at each of these times. This means that installation 2 will order at times 10, 20,
30, . . . Demands for 10 units at installation 3 at these times will trigger orders at
times 20, 40, 60, . . .
Using (8.4) we obtain the equivalent echelon stock policy as Re
1 = 5, Re
2 = 20,
and Re
3 = 40. Recall that when considering the echelon stock, the inventory positions
at all installations are reduced by the ﬁnal demand, i.e., by one unit each time unit,
and not by the internal system orders. The initial inventory positions are: IPe0
1 = 10,
IPe0
2 = 30, and IPe0
3 = 60. It is easy to verify that the orders will be triggered at the
same times as with the installation stock policy.
Assume then that we change the echelon stock reorder point at installation 3 to
Re
3 = 42. This will not change the orders at installations 1 and 2, but the orders at
installation 3 will be triggered 2 time units earlier, i.e., at times 18, 38, 58, . . . Recall
that the echelon stock is reduced by one unit at a time. The resulting echelon stock
policy is not nested and it is impossible to get the same control by an installation
stock policy.

Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 show that in any serial inventory system an installation
stock policy is simply a special case of an echelon stock policy. This is also true
for assembly systems. Recall that these results depend on the assumption (8.1).
One advantage of an installation stock policy is that once the reorder points are
determined only local information is needed for controlling the replenishments. To
implement an echelon stock policy, we need both the installation inventory position
and the inventory positions of all downstream installations. An alternative is, at least
in principle, to have information of the initial echelon stock inventory position and
be able to keep track of the ﬁnal customer demand. In practice it is usually difﬁcult
though, to determine the echelon stock from these data because of various changes
in the inventory positions, for example, due to damage and obsolescence.
The higher generality of an echelon stock policy can be an advantage in certain
situations. We shall illustrate this by an example.
Example 8.3 Consider a serial system (Fig. 8.9) with N = 2 installations and batch
quantities Q1 = 50 and Q2 = 100. Assume that the ﬁnal demand at installation 1
is constant and continuous, 50 units per time unit. The lead-time at installation 1
(excluding possible delays at installation 2) is one time unit, and at installation 2 it
is 0.5 time units. No shortages are allowed, and the holding costs at installation 1
are higher than at installation 2. The optimal control of the system is illustrated in
Fig. 8.10.
Consider, for example, the two batches that are delivered to installation 1 at times
2 and 3. These two batches were ordered by installation 1 at times 1 and 2. The
delivery of these 100 units to the warehouse took place, just-in-time, at time 1.
Immediately after the delivery, 50 units were sent to installation 1. Since the lead-
time at installation 2 is 0.5 time units, the corresponding order was triggered at time
0.5. But this can never be achieved by an installation stock (R, Q) policy because it
is nested. Installation 2 can only order when installation 1 orders, i.e., at times 0, 1,
2, . . . This will lead to additional costs (See Axsäter and Juntti 1996). The optimal
control can be obtained by an echelon stock policy with Re
1 = 50 and Re
2 = 75. Just
before time 0.5 the installation inventory position is zero at installation 2 and 75 at
installation 1, since one batch is on order at installation 1.
Let us also state the following result from (Axsäter and Rosling 1993) .

Multi-Echelon Systems: Structures and Ordering Policies
Proposition 8.3 S policies based on the echelon stock are equivalent to S policies
based on the installation stock for general systems.
The dominance of echelon stock policies for serial and assembly systems does not
carry over to distribution systems. For such systems an installation stock policy may
perform better in certain situations, but the opposite can also be true. In general, the
differences are relatively small (Axsäter and Juntti 1996), but in special situations
very large differences may occur (Axsäter 1997).
A KANBAN policy can be interpreted as an installation stock (R, Q) policy with
constraints on the number of outstanding orders. By applying the same constraints to
echelon stock policies, we obtain a class of policies which, for serial and assembly
systems, contains the KANBAN policies as a subset. SeeAxsäter and Rosling (1999).
8.2.4
Material Requirements Planning
When using reorder point systems, based on the installation stock or on the echelon
stock for multi-echelon inventory control, it is generally implicitly assumed that the
demands at the different installations are stochastic but still relatively stationary. The
reorder points are updated with a certain periodicity but do not change much over
time. However, especially in production, it is common to ﬁnd settings where such
reorder point systems do not perform well. Consider, for example, a component for
which nearly all demand occurs twice per year when assembling a certain product.
Assume that the production lead-time of the component is 3 weeks. In such a case it
is generally suitable to start production of the component a little more than 3 weeks
before the two times per year when large numbers of the component are needed in
production. A reorder point system could in principle provide this control, provided
that the reorder point is updated continuously with respect to the immediate lead-
time demand caused by production of higher level items. In the considered case the
expected lead-time demand would then be close to zero unless we are within 3 weeks
of one of the production times. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is essentially
such a reorder point system, where the reorder points are updated continuously with
respect to known discrete requirements.
To be able to update the lead-time demand it is necessary to keep track of all
future production plans for higher level items that may affect the lead-time demand.
The time horizon for the planning system should therefore exceed the total system
lead-time, i.e., the time from ordering raw materials to deliveries of ﬁnal products.
We shall now describe material requirements planning in detail. The planning
procedure is usually applied in a periodic review, rolling horizon setting. The
review period can be, for example, 1 week. The planning procedure is based on the
following data:
• A production program for ﬁnal products, a Master Production Schedule (MPS). In
a make-to-order environment the master schedule is usually comprised of plans for
ﬁnal assembly and delivery to customers. The master production schedule must
cover the total system lead-time, i.e., the time span between ordering raw materials

and delivering end products to customers. Production beyond that horizon cannot
affect today’s plans for components and raw materials.
•
External demands of other items, e.g., demands that do not emanate from
production plans for higher level items. An example is the demand for spare
parts.
• A bill of material for each item specifying all of its immediate components and
their numbers per unit of the parent.
•
Inventory status for all items, i.e., stock on hand, stock on order, and backorders.
•
Constant lead-times for all items.
•
Rules for safety stocks (and/or safety times) and batch quantities.
The procedure starts with end products, i.e., items that only face external demand.
The requirements of these items are given by the master production schedule. These
items are sometimes denoted Level 0 items. Next we consider all items that are
immediate components of Level 0 items. These items, which can also face external
demand, are denoted Level 1 items. More generally, Level n items are direct
components of Level n – 1 items. They can also be components of higher level items
and have external demand.
Let us consider the simple product structure in Fig. 8.11. We start with the end
item, item 1. Table 8.2 illustrates how the net requirements of item 1 are determined.
In the ﬁrst column the planning parameters, lead-time, order quantity, and safety
stock, are given. If the order quantity is one, this is usually termed lot-for-lot in
connection with material requirements planning. Table 8.2 describes the planning
situation at the end of period 0, i.e., just before the start of period 1. The inventory on
hand at that time is 22. The given gross requirements of item 1 in different periods are
obtained from the master production schedule, since item 1 is an end product. Usually
the requirements as well as the deliveries are assumed to occur in the beginning of a
period. A requirement occurs just after a possible delivery. The scheduled receipts in
Table 8.2 show planned deliveries of outstanding real orders. The projected inventory
is the inventory level after the gross requirement and the scheduled receipt. In period
1 the initial inventory is reduced by the gross requirement in period 1 and we obtain
the projected inventory 22 – 10 = 12. In period 2 the receipt is added and we obtain
12 + 25 = 37 etc. In period 4 the projected inventory declines to 2 units. The safety
stock is 5 units. The most common convention when determining the net requirement
is to require that backorders plus the safety stock should be covered. This means that

the net requirement in period 4 is 3 units. In period 5 the additional net requirement
is 20, since 3 + 20–18 = 5. It is straightforward to complete the table.
We shall in this section follow the mentioned convention that the net requirement
should cover the safety stock. Sometimes another rule is used, though. According
to the alternative rule, there is no net requirement unless the projected inventory is
negative. But when there is a net requirement, the number of units should also cover
the safety stock. In Table 8.2 this means that there is no net requirement in period 4,
while the net requirement in period 5 is increased by 3 units to 23.
Let us now replace the net requirements in Table 8.2 by planned orders. We shall
also let the planned orders affect the projected inventory. Note that the order quantity
is 25 and that the lead-time is one period. To cover the net requirement in period 4
we need to trigger an order of size 25. This order must be placed in period 3 due to
the lead-time. See Table 8.3. Note that a planned order is represented by its starting
time, while a scheduled receipt is represented by its delivery time. A planned order
is replaced by a scheduled receipt when the order is started. This is because we want
to make a difference between real and planned orders. If for example, in period 3,
we choose to initiate the planned order in that period, it is removed from planned
orders and added as a scheduled receipt in period 4.
The projected inventory is still below the safety stock in period 6. We therefore
need a second order in period 5. This gives the ﬁnal MRP record in Table 8.4.
We can interpret the planning of orders as the application of an installation stock
reorder point system, where the reorder point is the lead-time demand plus the safety
stock minus one (the projected inventory should be larger or equal to the safety stock).
Without an order in period 3, the inventory position after the gross requirement is 12.
The reorder point in period 3 is 10 + 5 −1 = 14. This means that an order is triggered.
After the order the inventory position is 37. In period 4 the inventory position is 27 and
the reorder point 20 + 5 −1 = 24, i.e., no order is triggered. In period 5, the inventory
position is 7 and the reorder point 5 + 5 −1 = 9, and the second order is triggered.

Fig. 8.12 Material requirements planning for items 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 8.11
Tables 8.2 and 8.3 have mainly been used to explain the MRP logic. From now on
we will use the representation in Table 8.4 directly. Recall that Table 8.4 represents
the planning situation at the end of period 0. At the end of period 1 we consider a
similar table covering periods 2–9.
Let us now go back to Fig. 8.11. We assume that item 2 is only needed for
production of item 1, and that item 3 is only needed for production of item 2.
According to Table 8.4 we plan to start production of 25 units in the beginning of
periods 3 and 5. This means that we need 25 units of item 2 at the same times, i.e., we
have determined the gross requirements of item 2. Given the gross requirements, we
can apply the same planning procedure for item 2 and determine the planned orders,
which in turn are the gross requirements of item 3. The whole MRP procedure is
shown in Fig. 8.12.
Note that the planning procedure in Fig. 8.12 gives a shortage of item 3 in period
2. To avoid the shortage the order should have been started in period 0, but we are
already at the end of this period. The shortage means that the plans for items 1 and
2 cannot be followed. In practice there are usually several ways to overcome the

problem. Perhaps it is possible to temporarily reduce the lead-time of item 3 to one
period.Another alternative is to adjust the basis for the planning. It may, for example,
be possible to change the master production schedule, which determines the gross
requirements of item 1, or to adjust order quantities and safety stocks.
So far we have assumed that safety stocks are used to cover variations in demand
and lead-times. When applying MRP it is also common to use a safety time as an
alternative or supplement. This means that we plan the orders so that the deliveries
are expected to occur the safety time before the corresponding net requirements.
Table 8.5 shows the MRP record if we add a safety time of one period to the planning
situation in Table 8.4.
In Fig. 8.12 it is assumed that item 2 is only part of item 1 and that item 3 is
only part of item 2. It is very common, though, that an item is a component of many
higher level items. Figures 8.13 and 8.14 illustrate how this is handled in MRP. Recall
that when processing a certain item, plans for all items at higher levels are already
complete.
Sometimes it is important to keep track of which higher level items have generated
different gross requirements. If for example, we obtain an infeasible plan such as for
item 3 in Fig. 8.12, it is interesting to see if it is possible to avoid the difﬁculties by
changing the plans for one or more of the parent items. To be able to do that we need to
“peg” generated gross requirements with identiﬁcations of the items generating them.

8.2
Different Ordering Systems
165
MRP is often referred to as a push system since orders are in a sense triggered
in anticipation of future needs. Reorder point systems and KANBAN systems are
similarly said to be pull systems because orders are triggered when downstream
installations need them. This notation is unclear and misleading. An MRP system
is, in fact, a more general ordering system than an installation stock reorder point
system. Recall that the MRP logic can be interpreted as application of a reorder
point system, where the reorder point in each period is the lead-time demand plus
the safety stock minus one. The lead-time in the MRP system is a planning parameter
that does not necessarily need to correspond to an estimate of the real lead-time. If
we set the lead-time to zero, the reorder point is constant and equal to the safety
stock minus one. The safety stock is also a planning parameter that can be chosen
arbitrarily. Consequently, we can state the following proposition:
Proposition 8.4 For a general inventory system, an MRP system can give the same
control as any installation stock reorder point system.
In Axsäter and Rosling (1994) it is also shown that:
Proposition 8.5 For serial and assembly systems, MRP can work as any echelon
stock reorder point system.
Consequently we can conclude that if MRP is a push system, it is also a pull
system.
The MRP logic is simple, yet the computational effort can be very large if there
are thousands of items and complex multi-level product structures. In such systems
it is also difﬁcult to update all data. As we have discussed above, the major advantage
of MRP is that it enables us to keep track of relatively infrequent large requirements.
Many low level components often have a large number of parents, and the gross
requirements obtained from the MRP calculations will, for statistical reasons, be
very smooth. Quite often it is more practical for such items to forecast the demand
by exponential smoothing and use a simple reorder point system. These items can
then be excluded from the bills of material and the remaining product structures will
be simpler.
One problem with MRP can be that the plans for individual items change too
frequently over time. Even a very small change in the master production schedule
can lead to relatively large changes in the plans for many lower level items. This
“instability” of MRP is often called “nervousness”. One possibility to reduce the
nervousness is to “freeze” orders within a certain time frame. This means that orders
within this time frame are not changed according to the MRP logic.
It is most common to use MRP in production. But since a product structure
corresponds to a multi-echelon inventory system (See e.g., Fig. 8.8), we can also use
the same ordering technique in a distribution system. In this context the term MRP
is sometimes replaced by DRP, Distribution Requirements Planning.
Usually the MRP procedures that we have described are the core in a planning
system that also contains other planning modules. It is especially common to include
modules for capacity planning. In such more general systems MRP is then sometimes
interpreted as Manufacturing Resource Planning. The term MRP II is also used.

Capacity requirements can be estimated in two ways. One possibility is to forecast
the needed production capacity directly from the master production schedule. Such
a forecast is usually not very accurate since the inventory status of different items
is not taken into account. In general, this is denoted Rough Cut Capacity Planning
(RCCP). It is more accurate to estimate the capacity requirements after carrying
out the complete MRP calculations. This is usually denoted Capacity Requirements
Planning (CRP). Figure 8.15 illustrates how the modules can be coupled to each
other.
When choosing the master schedule, the capacity requirements are estimated
by Rough Cut Capacity Planning. After choosing the master schedule and going
through the MRP calculations, a more accurate estimate is obtained from Capacity
Requirements Planning. If there are large deviations between these two estimates of
the capacity requirements, and the more accurate estimate is infeasible, it may be
necessary to go back and adjust the master schedule.
Although the system in Fig. 8.15 contains more than material requirements plan-
ning, it is obvious that MRP is the heart of the system. The capacity planning modules
essentially give only the estimated capacity consequences of the MRP plan. A plan-
ning framework of this type is natural if the main task of the system is materials
management. If the main problem is to achieve high and smooth capacity utilization,
it can be more suitable to start with the capacity planning and let the results of this
planning be a basis for the materials management.
A so-called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can be seen as a further
extension of MRP. Such systems usually provide a number of additional functions,
many of which are outside the production area, like warehouse management, ship-
ping, ﬁnancial information and planning, etc. ERP can also be a multilocation system
and handle production planning across multiple sites, which is usually very important
for large corporations.
We refer to Orlicky (1975), Baker (1993), Silver et al. (1998), and Vollman et al.
(1997) for a more detailed treatment of MRP.

A major advantage of installation stock reorder point policies and KANBAN poli-
cies is that these policies are easy to implement. In particular, they only need local
information about inventory positions after the control parameters are set. One dis-
advantage, however, is that the information in the supply chain is delayed. Consider
again the material requirements planning in Fig. 8.12. Assume that the gross require-
ments of item 1 will increase due to larger demand from the ﬁnal customers. This
may lead to a change in the planned orders for item 1 so that the order in period 3 will
instead be placed in period 2. When using material requirements planning, this will
immediately lead to corresponding changes in the plans for items 2 and 3. We are con-
sequently able to let changes in the master production schedule directly affect plans
for all items. Echelon stock reorder point policies provide similar possibilities, since
the echelon stock is immediately affected by the ﬁnal customer demand. If the stocks
are controlled in a decentralized manner by installation stock reorder point policies,
the information concerning the increasing customer demand is not transmitted in the
same rapid way, however. With an installation stock reorder point system, the order
for item 1 in Fig. 8.12 may also be placed in period 2 instead of period 3. The problem
is that this information is not available at installation 2 until the order actually occurs
in period 2. Nothing happens during period 1. In some situations with large batch
quantities and many stages, such information delays can cause major problems.
There is also considerable evidence, theoretical as well as practical, that decentral-
ized installation stock policies in multi-echelon systems can yield very large demand
variations early in the material ﬂow, even though the ﬁnal demand is very stable.
Consider the simple serial system in Fig. 8.16.
Let us assume that the inventory system is part of a distribution system and that
the installations are situated far from each other. We also assume that the lead-times
are 5 weeks for each installation. The two installations are adapting their reorder
points with respect to the demand at their site. The demand at installation 2 is the
orders from installation 1. We shall also assume that both installations use periodic
review policies with a review period of 1 week. There are many similar items, but
the items are handled individually.
Assume now that site 1 estimates that the ﬁnal demand for all items has increased
by 20 %. Normally the site orders about 1 week’s demand each week. The increase
in customer demand means that the estimated lead-time demand is also increased by
20 %, which corresponds to the original demand during 1 week. The reorder points
are raised correspondingly. The orders from installation 1 will increase due both to
the higher reorder points and due to the increase in the demand. The resulting demand
at installation 2 in the ﬁrst week will increase by more than 100 %. If installation 2

168
8
Multi-Echelon Systems: Structures and Ordering Policies
adjusts its reorder points with respect to that change, the effects for its supplier will
be devastating.
Note that the demand at installation 2 in the long run will only increase by 20 %.
The very high demand just after the change is due to the adjustments of the reorder
points at installation 1. Furthermore, if installation 2 has information about the ﬁnal
customer demand, or if the dynamic effects that we have described are understood,
the adjustments of the reorder points at installation 2 can be expected to be less
dramatic.
The high demand variations at upstream stages have been analyzed and dis-
cussed by several authors. The ﬁrst well-known contribution was by Forrester (1961).
The phenomenon is today often denoted the bullwhip effect. For further details see
Baganha and Cohen (1998), Lee et al. (1997, 1997), and Towill and Del Vecchio
(1994). It is common to illustrate the bullwhip effect by a game concerning a distri-
bution system for beer, the Beer Game. Different variations of this game exist; see
Sterman (1989), and Chen and Samroengraja (2000) .
It is important to note that both the information delays and the problems of large
demand variations at upstream facilities are largely due to long lead-times and large
batch quantities. With small batch quantities, the times between orders will be short,
and the information will be transmitted relatively rapidly between the echelons even
when using an installation stock reorder point system. If the lead-times are short,
adjustments of the reorder points due to demand changes will also become small, and
the demand variations at the next upstream stage will be limited. Consequently, for
systems with small batch quantities and short lead-times, installation stock reorder
point policies and KANBAN policies will perform very well in most cases.

(b) Consider constant continuous demand, one unit per time unit, and verify
that the two policies order at the same times.
(c) Increase Re

equivalent installation stock policy exist?
8.4 Consider again the serial inventory system in Problem 8.3. The production con-
trol manager has been visiting Japan. Inﬂuenced by what he has seen there he
wants to use a KANBAN system. For installation 1 he has one card and a con-
tainer for 50 units. For installation 2 he has also one card but a container for 100
units. Both lead-times are zero so no shortages can occur. Initially there are 50
units in stock at each installation. The demand at installation 1 is one unit per
time unit.
(a) The assistant production control manager thinks that the new ideas are un-
necessary and suggests an equivalent installation stock (R, Q) system. How
should R and Q be chosen for the two installations?
(b) Is it possible to get the same control by an echelon stock policy? How should
in that case R and Q be chosen for the two installations?
8.5 Consider again the serial inventory system in Problem 8.3. Let the batch quanti-
ties be Q1 = 10 and Q2 = 20. The installation stock reorder points are Ri
1 = 22
and Ri
2 = 35. The initial installation stock inventory positions are IPi0

to verify that your result is correct.

Chapter 9
Multi-Echelon Systems: Lot Sizing
In Chap. 8 we have discussed why and how multi-echelon inventory systems appear
in practice, and how the most common ordering systems work. We shall now turn to
the problem of choosing batch quantities for a multi-echelon inventory system. Note
that this important problem must be solved independently of which type of ordering
system we use.
First of all, when determining order quantities for a multi-echelon inventory sys-
tem, it is not optimal to handle each site individually. The choice of batch quantity
at a certain site will namely affect the demand structure at the next upstream site.
This dependency makes the determination of batch quantities much more complex.
Although it is not optimal to determine batch quantities individually for each site,
this is very common in practice because it is so easy. Generally this will lead to order
quantities that are too small.
When dealing with order quantities for multi-echelon systems we shall assume
that the customer demand is known and deterministic, i.e., we disregard random
variations. In case of stochastic demand, it is normally reasonable to replace the
stochastic demand by its mean and use a deterministic model when determining
batch quantities. The stochastic demand variations, are however, taken into account,
in a second step, when we determine safety stocks and reorder points. This approx-
imation, which is common also for single-echelon systems, is usually more or less
necessary for multi-echelon systems.
Furthermore, we make the standard assumption that all lead-times are zero. Recall
that for a single-echelon system with a constant lead-time and deterministic demand,
we can make this assumption without any lack of generality. In case of a positive lead-
time L, we just need to order L time units earlier. When dealing with multi-echelon
systems it is generally possible to handle serial and assembly systems similarly, i.e.,
we can determine batch quantities for zero lead-times and still use the results also for
positive lead-times. For distribution systems (Fig. 8.2) and general systems (Fig. 8.4),
however, positive lead-times may be more difﬁcult to deal with.

Identical Order Quantities
9.1.1
Inﬁnite Production Rates
Consider ﬁrst the simple assembly system and the corresponding product structure
in Fig. 9.1.
Let us think of a production system. Assume that we have chosen the units so that
when producing one unit of item 1, exactly one unit of item 2 and one unit of item 3
are needed as components. (Recall that this is always possible.)
Item 1 is a ﬁnal product with constant continuous demand d. Let the setup costs
be A1, A2, and A3, and the holding costs h1, h2, and h3.
Furthermore, we assume inﬁnite production rates, and that for some reason, the
same batch quantity is used for all three items. Inﬁnite production rate means that
the whole batch is delivered at the same time. (As discussed above we also assume
that the lead-times are zero.)
Given that the batch quantities are the same, it is obviously optimal to produce
batches of items 2 and 3 just-in-time for the production of item 1. This means that
thereareneveranystocksofitems2and3, andallthreeitemsareproducedatthesame
time. But if the items are produced at the same time, we can replace the considered
three items by a single item with setup cost A = A1 + A2 + A3, and holding cost
h = h1. In case of constant demand, we can then simply use the classical economic
order quantity model (4.3) for determining the optimal batch quantity.
Our conclusions for the simple assembly system in Fig. 9.1 can easily be
generalized to a general assembly system and to time-varying demand.
9.1.2
Finite Production Rates
If we have ﬁnite production rates but still identical lot sizes, it is more difﬁcult to
determine the optimal lot size for a multi-echelon system. However, for serial and
assembly systems and constant demand, it is still usually possible to determine the
optimal batch size from a model, which can be seen as a variation of the classical
economic order quantity model. We shall illustrate this by an example.

9.2
Constant Demand
173
Example 9.1 Consider a product that is produced from raw material in two ma-
chines, 1 and 2. The machines have production rates p1 > p2 > d, where d is the
constant customer demand. At the beginning of a production cycle, a batch of raw
material is delivered to machine 1. The output from machine 1 is immediately (con-
tinuously) transferred to machine 2. When the whole batch has completed production
in machine 2, it is transported to a warehouse facing the constant customer demand.
The machines have setup costs A1 and A2. There is also a ﬁxed cost A3 associated
with the transportation of a batch of goods from machine 2 to the warehouse. The
holding cost before machine 1 is h1 per unit and time unit. After being processed
in machine 1 the holding cost is h2, and after machine 2 it is h3 (valid also at the
warehouse). We wish to determine the optimal batch size.
First of all, we note that we can disregard the holding costs during transportation
since each unit is in transport the same time independent of the batch size. Still we
have four echelons where the holding costs are affected by the batch size, i.e., before
machine 1 (1), between machines 1 and 2 (2), after machine 2 (3) and at the warehouse
(4). Figure 9.2 illustrates the development of the stock levels over time. From the
ﬁgure it is easy to determine the average stock over time at the different stock points.
Consider, for example, the stock level before machine 1. The time between two
deliveries is Q/d. During this time we have stock in front of the machine while the
machine is producing, i.e., during the time Q/p1. This means that the fraction of time
with a positive stock level is d/p1. The average stock level while the stock is positive
is Q/2. The average stock level over all times is therefore (Q/2)(d/p1). Other stocks
can be handled similarly. Each batch will give ordering costs in both machines and
a ﬁxed cost for transportation. Consequently we can express the total relevant costs
as:
C = Q
2
 d
p1
h1 + ( d
p2
−d
p1
)h2 + ( d
p2
+ 1)h3

+ d
Q(A1 + A2 + A3).
(9.1)
By setting the derivative equal to zero we obtain the optimal batch quantity as
Q∗=

2(A1 + A2 + A3)d
d
p1 h1 + ( d
p2 −d
p1 )h2 + ( d
p2 + 1)h3
.
(9.2)
Note that if we let the production rates approach inﬁnity, we are back in the situation
considered in Sect. 9.1.1 and we only need to consider a single echelon with setup
cost A = A1 + A2 + A3, and holding cost h = h3. The only stock that we need to
consider is then the stock at the warehouse.
9.2
Constant Demand
We shall now consider the more general case when the batch quantities at different
installations do not need to be identical. We assume constant continuous demand for
the end product and inﬁnite production rates.

A Simple Serial System with Constant Demand
Consider the simple serial system in Fig. 9.3.
Let us assume that item 1 is a ﬁnal product which is produced from one unit of
the component 2, which in turn, is obtained from an external supplier. As we have
discussed above, we assume that the lead-times are zero. The demand, d, for item 1

9.2
Constant Demand
175
is constant and continuous. Both items have ordering costs, A1 and A2, as well as
holding costs, h1 and h2. When delivering a batch, the whole quantity is delivered
at the same time. No backorders are allowed. We want to determine optimal batch
quantities, Q1 and Q2. Note that except for the two echelons, the assumptions are
exactly the same as in the classical economic order quantity model, see Sect. 4.1.
Example 9.2 Let the problem parameters be d = 8, A1 = 20, A2 = 80, h1 = 5, and
h2 = 4.
Item 1 faces constant continuous demand and the costs are consequently obtained
as
C1 = h1
Q1
2 + A1
d
Q1
.
(9.3)
One approach to solving the problem could be to apply the classical economic order
quantity model to item 1, i.e., to minimize (9.3). We obtain
Q1 =

2A1d
h1
= 8,
and the corresponding costs
C1 =

2A1dh1 = 40.
The demand for item 2 is then discrete and not continuous, 8 units each time unit.
Given a constant Q1, we should always choose Q2 as a multiple of Q1,
Q2 = kQ1,
(9.4)
where k is a positive integer. This is easy to show in the same way as we showed
Property 1 in Sect. 4.5.
Figure 9.4 illustrates the behavior of the inventory levels for k = 3. Since the
lead-times are zero there is no difference between inventory levels and inventory
positions. The ﬁgure shows both the installation stock and the echelon stock. The
echelon stock of item 2 is simply the sum of the stock at both installations. For item
1 the echelon stock is equal to the installation stock since there is no downstream
stock.
The costs for item 2 are obtained as:
C2 = h2
(k −1)Q1
2
+ A2
d
kQ1
,
(9.5)
since the average installation stock of item 2 is (k −1)Q1/2. C2 is evidently convex
in k. If we disregard that k2 has to be an integer when minimizing C2 we obtain:
k∗= 1

If k∗< 1 it is optimal to choose k = 1.Assume that k∗> 1. Let k′ be the largest integer
less or equal to k∗, i.e., k′ ≤k∗< k′ + 1. It is easy to show that it is optimal to choose
k = k′ if k∗/k′ ≤(k′ + 1)/k∗. Otherwise k = k′ + 1 is optimal. (See Sect. 4.1.2.)
We obtain k∗≈2.24 and it is optimal to have k = 2. The corresponding costs
are obtained from (9.5) as C2 = 56, and we get the total costs per time unit as
C = C1+C2 = 40 + 56 = 96.As we shall show below, this is not the optimal solution.
It is not feasible to optimize item 1 separately without considering the consequences
for item 2, since the batch size for item 1 will affect the demand for item 2.
Let us now derive the optimal solution. It can be shown that (9.4) must be satisﬁed
in the optimal solution for a two-level system. (As illustrated by Example 9.4 in
Sect. 9.2.2, this is not necessarily true if there are more than two levels.) The total
costs are obtained by adding (9.3) and (9.5),
C = C1 + C2 = (h1 + (k −1)h2) Q1
2 +

A1 + A2
k
 d
Q1
.
(9.6)
Alternatively, we can represent the costs in terms of the echelon stock. Since the
echelon stock of item 2 includes the stock of item 1, the holding cost for item 1
should only represent the value added when producing item 1 from item 2. This
means that we shall use the echelon holding costs e1 = h1 −h2, and e2 = h2. We
obtain:

The costs (9.7) and (9.8) are not the same as the costs (9.3) and (9.5) but it is easy to
verify that the total costs,

are the same, i.e., the cost expressions (9.6) and (9.9) are equivalent. The represen-
tation in (9.7)–(9.9) is, in general, easier to handle since the structures of (9.7) and
(9.8) are exactly the same. This is also illustrated by Fig. 9.4.
For a given k the optimal Q1 is obtained from (9.9) by setting the derivative equal
to zero.
Q1 =

2(A1 + A2
k )d
e1 + ke2
.
(9.10)
Inserting (9.10) in (9.9) we obtain the optimal costs for a given k as
C(k) =

2(A1 + A2
k )d(e1 + ke2).
(9.11)
It is easy to see that
C2(k) = 2d(A1e1 + A2e2 + A1e2k + A2e1
k
)
(9.12)
is a convex function of k. The optimization of (9.12) with respect to k is similar to
the optimization of (9.5) above. First we disregard that k has to be an integer. We get
k∗=

A2e1
A1e2
.
(9.13)
If k∗< 1 it is optimal to choose k = 1. Assume that k∗> 1. Let k′ be the largest
integer less or equal to k∗, i.e., k′ ≤k∗< k′ + 1. It is optimal to choose k = k′ if
k∗/k′ ≤(k′ + 1)/k∗. Otherwise k = k′ + 1 is optimal.
If A1/e1 ≥A2/e2 we get k = 1. This means that we should use the same batch size
for the two items, and consequently, each time we produce a batch of item 2, the batch
should immediately be used for production of item 1. This implies that we do not
need any stock of item 2 and that our two-stage system can be replaced by a single-
stage system. It can be shown that the condition A1/e1 ≥A2/e2 is also sufﬁcient in
case of time-varying demand, see Axsäter and Nuttle (1987) and Sect. 9.3.3.
Example 9.3 Consider again the problem in Example 9.2, i.e., d = 8, A1 = 20, A2 =
80, h1 = 5, and h2 = 4.
We obtain e1 = h1−h2 = 1, and e2 = h2 = 4. From (9.13) we get k∗= 1 which is,
consequently, the optimal value of k. Applying (9.10) and (9.11) we get Q∗
1 ≈17.89,
Q∗
2 = kQ∗
1 = Q∗
1 ≈17.89, and C∗≈89.44, i.e., about 7 % lower than the costs
obtained in Example 9.2. The batch quantity of item 1 has increased by more than
100 %. This is rather typical. If we take the multi-echelon structure into account, this
will very often lead to a larger order quantity for the end product.
Note that (9.10) and (9.11) are essentially equivalent to the corresponding ex-
pressions (4.3) and (4.4) for the classical economic order quantity model. The only
difference is that the ordering cost A is replaced by:
A′
1 = A1 + A2/k,
(9.14)

(9.15)
Note also that it is not clear how the “real” holding costs should be determined in
different situations. Assume that there is plenty of stock of item 2. If we produce
one unit of item 1, the holding costs per time unit for item 1 will increase by h1,
but since the stock of item 2 is reduced by one unit, the holding costs per time unit
for item 2 are reduced by h2. The increase in holding costs therefore corresponds to
the value added instead of the total value. The additional holding cost is the echelon
holding cost e1 = h1 −h2. If, on the other hand, we need to replenish item 2 in
order to produce item 1, the holding costs will increase by the normal holding cost
rate h1. The average additional holding costs when producing one unit of item 1 will
consequently be somewhere between e1 and h1.
9.2.2
Roundy’s 98 % Approximation
Even if customer demand is constant, multi-echelon lot sizing problems may be
very difﬁcult to solve. Optimal solutions are sometimes surprisingly complex. For
example, the optimal solution for a serial system with constant demand can mean
order quantities that vary over time, see Williams (1982) and Example 9.4 below.
Roundy (1985, 1986), however, has shown that it is often possible to use rather simple
approximations with a guaranteed cost performance of at most 2 % above the optimal
costs. We shall describe how Roundy’s technique can be applied to a serial system,
but it is also possible to use the same approach for assembly and distribution systems.
An overview is given in Muckstadt and Roundy (1993). Recall that we have already
used Roundy’s approach in Sect. 7.3.1.2 in connection with joint replenishments.
Consider a serial system with N stages, see Fig. 9.5.
The ﬁnal demand at installation 1 is constant and continuous. There are nonnega-
tive ordering and echelon holding costs at all stages. No shortages are allowed. When
producing one unit of item i −1, one unit of item i is needed as a component (i = 2,
3,. . ., N). We disregard the lead-times. It is easy to see that an optimal solution is
nested, i.e., a batch at stage i should exactly cover an integer number of batches
at stage i −1. (See Sect. 4.5 and the explanation of Property 1.) As we will see in
Example 9.4, however, the optimal batch sizes are not necessarily constant over time.
Roundy’s approximation means ﬁrst of all that the batch quantities for different
items are restricted to be constant over time. Let us introduce the following notation:

9.2
Constant Demand
179
d = ﬁnal demand per time unit for item 1,
Ai = ordering cost for item i,
ei = echelon holding cost for item i,
Qi = batch quantity for item i.
Furthermore, the batch quantity for item i is restricted to be a power of two times the
batch quantity for item i −1, i.e.,
Qi = 2kiQi−1,
i = 2, 3, ..., N,
(9.16)
where ki is a nonnegative integer. This implies that the solution must be nested, i.e.,
if a batch of item i is produced at some time, we must also have production of items
i −1, i −2, . . ., 1.
Our objective is to minimize the total holding and ordering costs. In analogy with
(9.7)–(9.9) we have:
min
Q1,Q2,...,QN
N

i=1
(ei
Qi
2 + Ai
d

),
(9.17)
subject to the constraints that the batch quantities are nonnegative and satisfy (9.16).
What is particularly interesting about Roundy’s solution is that the costs are at
most 2 % higher than the optimal costs, i.e., without the constraints (9.16).
Roundy’s approach is to ﬁrst relax the constraints (9.16) and instead use the milder
constraints:
Qi ≥Qi−1,
i = 2, 3, ..., N.
(9.18)
Note that (9.16) implies (9.18) while the opposite is not true. Therefore, by using
(9.18) we will get a lower bound for the costs when using the constraints (9.16). The
objective function (9.17) is convex and the constraints (9.18) are linear. The unique
solution of the relaxed problem can therefore be obtained through the Lagrangean
relaxation:

It is possible to show that the optimal solution of the relaxed problem must give
all e′
i ≥0. To see this note that the optimal costs for the relaxed problem can be
obtained as the solution of:

(9.21)
without any constraints on the batch quantities, i.e., a problem with independent
items, ordering costs Ai, and echelon holding costs e′
i. If e′i < 0 we can let Qi →∞
which means that the costs in (9.21) approach −∞. This is clearly impossible.
Let us now compare the original holding costs ei to the holding costs e′
i, see
(9.20). Recall that the multipliers are nonnegative. Consider ﬁrst the effect of λ2.
The echelon holding cost rate at stage 2 is reduced by 2λ2 and the echelon holding
cost rate at stage 1 is increased by 2λ2. More generally, the effect of λi is that the
echelon holding cost rate at stage i is reduced by 2λi and the echelon holding cost
rate at stage i−1 is increased by 2λi.
What is very interesting is that this implies that (9.21) provides a lower bound for
the optimal costs for our original problem where the batch quantities can be chosen
in any way. They can, for example, vary over time. Yet the echelon stock at stage
i−1 is always less than or equal to the echelon stock at stage i. A change from the
echelon holding costs ei to the echelon holding costs e′
i can therefore not increase
the costs for the optimal solution. Furthermore, given the echelon holding costs e′
i,
(9.21) provides a lower bound for the costs since there are no constraints at all on
the batch quantities.
Assume that we have solved the relaxed problem. This means that we have a lower
bound for the optimal costs and batch quantities satisfying (9.18). We can now adjust
this solution by rounding the batch quantities so that they can be expressed as
Qi = 2miq.
(9.22)
We know from Sect. 7.1 that if q is given, the maximum cost increase is at most
6 %, and if we can also adjust q to get a better approximation the cost increase is at
most 2 %. Due to (9.18), we know that mi ≥mi−1 and the batch quantities obtained
must consequently satisfy (9.16). We have now obtained Roundy’s solution of the
problem. We have feasible constant batch quantities and the cost increase compared
to the optimal solution is at most 2 %, since it is at most 2 % compared to the lower
bound (9.21).
It is possible to use the considered Lagrangean relaxation for numerical determi-
nation of Roundy’s solution, but generally it is much simpler to use the following
technique. Consider the relaxed problem. Without the constraints (9.18) it would be
optimal to use Q∗
i = (2Aid/ei)1/2 for all i. Consequently, if Ai/ei increases with i, we
have found the optimal solution since the resulting batch quantities will satisfy (9.18).
Assume that for some i, Ai/ei < Ai−1/ei−1, or equivalently that Q∗
i < Q∗
i−1. Also as-
sume that in the optimal solution of the relaxed problem Qi > Qi−1. This implies that
Qi ≤Q∗
i since we would otherwise reduce Qi, and similarly that Qi−1 ≥Q∗
i−1since

we would otherwise increase Qi−1. But this means that Qi < Qi−1, which is a con-
tradiction. Consequently, Qi = Qi−1 in the optimal solution of the relaxed problem.
This means that we can aggregate items i−1 and i into a single item with ordering
cost Ai- 1 + Ai and echelon holding cost ei- 1 + ei. Next we consider the resulting
reduced problem with N−1 items. If Ai/ei < Ai- 1/ei- 1 for some i, we can aggregate
the two items; otherwise we obtain the optimal solution of the relaxed problem from
the classical economic order quantity model, etc.
Example 9.4 Consider a serial system with N = 4 installations (items). The constant
continuous demand for item 1 is d = 1. Ordering and echelon holding costs are given
in Table 9.1.
First we want to solve the relaxed problem, i.e., we want to minimize the costs
in (9.17) with respect to (9.18). First consider items 1 and 2. Note that A1/e1 =
5/4 > A2/e2 = 2/10. This means that Q1 = Q2 in the optimal solution, and we
can aggregate items 1 and 2 into a single item with ordering cost A1 + A2 = 70
and echelon holding cost e1 +e2 = 140. We can now see that A4/e4 = 12.5 ≥A3/e3 =
3 ≥(A1+A2)/(e1+e2) = 0.5. The constraints (9.18) will therefore not be binding for
the remaining three items: items 1 and 2 together, item 3, and item 4. By optimizing
each batch quantity separately, we obtain the optimal solution of the relaxed problem:
Q1 = Q2 = (2d(A1 + A2)/(e1 + e2))1/2 = 11/2 = 1, Q3 = 61/2, and Q4 = 251/2 = 5.
The corresponding costs per time unit are: C1 + 2 = (2d(A1 +A2)(e1 +e2))1/2 = 140,
C3 = 61/2, and C4 = 50. The total relaxed costs are then Crel = 190 + 61/2 = 192.45.
(The corresponding Lagrangean multipliers in (9.20) are λ2 = 30, λ3 = 0, and λ4 = 0.
This means that e′
1 = 40 + 60 = 100 and e′
2 = 100 −60 = 40. The ratios A1/e′
1
and A2/e′
2 are then both equal to 0.5, which implies identical batch quantities when
optimizing (9.21).)
Next we round the order quantities to obtain Roundy’s feasible solution. Let us
ﬁrst, for simplicity, set q = 1 in (9.22). We then obtain the rounded batch quantities
Q1 = Q2 = 1, Q3 = 2, and Q4 = 4. This gives the costs C = 193.75, i.e., 0.68 %
above the relaxed costs and well below the guaranteed 6 %. It turns out that an
optimal q in (9.22) is q = 1.0626 (we omit the details). When using this q, it is
optimal to use the same multiples, i.e., Q1 = Q2 = q, Q3 = 2q, and Q4 = 4q. The
corresponding costs are 193.39, i.e., 0.49 % above the relaxed costs to be compared
to the guaranteed 2 %.
Note, however, that this is not the optimal solution. A feasible solution is to use
Q1 = Q2 = 1, Q4 = 5, and to have Q3 = 2 and Q3 = 3 every second time. This
nonstationary solution gives the costs C = 192.5, i.e., only 0.026 % above the lower

bound from the relaxed problem. Why is this solution so good? Note ﬁrst that the
costs for item 3 are very low. Furthermore, Q3 = 2 and Q3 = 3 work equally well.
The best individual solutions for items 1, 2 and 4 is Q1 = Q2 = 1, and Q4 = 5, and
these batch quantities are combined with having Q3 = 2 and Q3 = 3 every second
time.
The corresponding solution for an assembly system is similar. The solution for
a distribution system is different, however. For a distribution system it is generally
not possible to keep the batch quantities constant. Instead, the cycle times are kept
constant and it is required that they can be expressed as powers-of-two times some
basic period.
To see that constant cycle times can give time-varying batch quantities in a
distribution system with constant demand, consider the system in Fig. 9.6.
Assume that customer demands at installations 1 and 2 are 2 units per time unit,
and that the cycle times are T0 = 1, T1 = 1/2 and T2 = 2. The batches at installations
1 and 2 are, of course, constant and equal to 1 and 4, respectively. But the batches
at installation 0 are 2 and 6 every second time. During a cycle time T0 = 1, there is
always a demand for two batches of size 1 from installation 1. However, the demand
from installation 2 is 4 units every second cycle.
9.3
Time-Varying Demand
Let us now instead consider time-varying discrete demand. As before, we assume
that the lead-times are zero. No shortages are allowed and it is assumed that the
customerdemandstakeplaceinthebeginningofaperiodimmediatelyafterapossible
delivery. Except that we are dealing with more than one echelon, the assumptions
are consequently exactly the same as in Sects. 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
9.3.1
Sequential Lot Sizing
Consider again the simple serial system in Fig. 9.7 and the following example.
Example 9.5 Assume that ordering and holding costs are the same as in Examples
9.2 and 9.3, i.e., the ordering costs are A1 = 20 and A2 = 80, and the holding costs per

9.3
Time-Varying Demand

unit and time unit are h1 = 5 and h2 = 4. We consider a time horizon of four periods
with customer demands for item 1 equal to d1 = 3, d2 = 6, d3 = 5, and d4 = 2.
As in Example 9.2 we shall ﬁrst solve the problem sequentially and disregard its
multi-stage structure. This is a common approach in practice. We start with the end
item, item 1, for which we know the demands. After determining batch quantities
for item 1 we know the demands for item 2, i.e., the orders from installation 1, and
are also able to determine batch quantities for this item. It is easy to determine the
optimal solution for item 1 when disregarding item 2 by applying the Wagner-Whitin
algorithm with the ordering cost A1 = 20 and the holding cost h1 = 5. Since there
are only four periods, it is also easy to derive the optimal solution by considering
all feasible alternatives. Note ﬁrst that due to the high holding cost, the demands in
periods 1–3 should be covered by separate deliveries. Given this we can see that the
batch in period 3 should also cover the demand in period 4. The optimal solution for
item 1 is consequently to have three batches. The ﬁrst batch has size 3 and covers
the demand in period 1, the second batch has size 6 and covers the demand in period
2, and the third batch has size 7 and covers the demands in periods 3 and 4. It is also
easy to see that the costs C1 for item 1 are
C1 = 3 · 20 + 2 · 5 = 70,
i.e., three ordering costs plus the holding costs during period 3 for the demand in
period 4.
The solution for item 1 implies that the demands for item 2 in periods 1–4 are 3,
6, 7, and 0, respectively, i.e., the demands occur when we produce item 1. Given
these demands, the ordering cost A2 = 80, and the holding cost h2 = 4, it is easy
to conclude that the optimal solution for item 2 is to have a single batch of size 16
in period 1. The total holding costs for item 2 are then 80, and there are still some
holding costs left if we add another order, which would incur the additional ordering
cost 80. The costs for item 2 are obtained as
C2 = 80 + 6 · 4 + 2 · 7 · 4 = 160,
and the total costs as
C = C1 + C2 = 70 + 160 = 230.
The solution obtained is not optimal. We minimized the costs for item 1 without
considering the implications for item 2. It is easy to ﬁnd a better solution. Choose
instead to have a single batch of size 16 for both item 1 and item 2. We then obtain
the costs as
C1 = 20 + 6 · 5 + 2 · 5 · 5 + 3 · 2 · 5 = 130,

184

Multi-Echelon Systems: Lot Sizing
C2 = 80,
C = C1 + C2 = 210.
As expected, this solution means additional costs for item 1. But the cost reduction
for item 2 is larger. It is possible to show that this is the optimal solution.
9.3.2
Sequential Lot Sizing with Modiﬁed Parameters
Let us now consider an alternative relatively simple approximate technique, which
was suggested by Blackburn and Millen (1982). When using this technique we still
determine the lot sizes sequentially. However, we use modiﬁed cost parameters.
When dealing with the two-echelon serial system in Fig. 9.7, we still start with item
1. Instead of the original cost parameters, however, we use the modiﬁed parameters
(9.14) and (9.15), which give the optimal solution in case of constant demand.
Example 9.6 We shall solve the problem in Example 9.5 by applying the suggested
technique. Recall that A1 = 20, A2 = 80, h1 = 5, and h2 = 4. The customer demands
for item 1 are d1 = 3, d2 = 6, d3 = 5, and d4 = 2.
In Example 9.3 we determined the optimal k = 1. Note that the optimal k is not
affected by the demand, see (9.13). From (9.14) and (9.15) we get A′1 = A1 +A2 =
100, and h′1 = e1 + e2 = 5. If we use these modiﬁed cost parameters and solve the
problem for item 1 by the Wagner-Whitin algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution,
i.e., a single batch of size 16 in period 1. Item 2 has no upstream installation so we
use the original parameters A2 = 80 and h2 = 4. Since there is a single demand in
period 1 it is obvious that we will have a single batch in period 1.
Let us now leave the simple serial system and consider a general assembly system.
See Fig. 9.8.
Recall that in an assembly system each installation has at most one downstream
successor. We can also, without any lack of generality, assume that one unit of each
component is needed when producing one unit of a parent item. Lot sizing for an
assembly system is more difﬁcult than for a serial system. Yet it is much easier to
deal with an assembly system than with a general system.
It is possible to generalize the approximate technique of Blackburn and Millen
(1982) to assembly systems. Let
s(j) = the installation which is an immediate successor of installation j,
p(j) = the set of installations which are immediate predecessors of installation j.
In Fig. 9.8 we have, for example, s(4) = 3, and p(3) = {4, 5}.
We obtain the echelon holding costs as
ej = hj −

Example 9.7 Consider the assembly system in Fig. 9.8. Table 9.2 illustrates how
the modiﬁed ordering and holding costs are obtained. The original costs Aj and hj
are given. We get the echelon holding costs from (9.23) starting with items 2, 4, and
5, which have no predecessors. Consider again items 2, 4 and 5. For these items
Aj ′ = Aj and hj ′ = ej. We can then also get the ratios kj for these items from (9.26)
(rounded to integers). Next we go to item 3. We get A3′ and h3′ from (9.24) and
(9.25). Thereafter we can determine k3. Finally we obtain A1′ and h1′.

Other Approaches
It is also possible to solve quite large lot sizing problems exactly for assembly sys-
tems with deterministic time-varying demand by using mathematical programming
techniques. SeeAfentakis et al. (1984) and Rosling (1986). Such an approach would,
however, be difﬁcult to use in practice if there are many items and complex product
structures.
There are also various other approximate techniques. One example is Graves
(1981), who suggests an iterative procedure.
Furthermore, it may sometimes be possible to simplify the lot-sizing problem by
initially showing that some items should always be produced in identical batch sizes.
A general assembly system can be seen as a number of subsystems with two levels.
See Fig. 9.9.
AssumethattheinstallationsinFig.9.9haveorderingcostsAi andechelonholding
costs ei. It is possible to show that all installations should use the same batch sizes
provided that the following condition is satisﬁed (Axsäter and Nuttle 1987) .

Note that the condition is sufﬁcient but not necessary. Recall that we have already
discussed a special case of this condition in connection with (9.13). If we always use
the same batch quantities in the subsystem in Fig. 9.9, we only need stock of item 1.
This means, as we have discussed in Sect. 9.1.1, that the subsystem can be replaced
by a single item with ordering cost A1 + A2 + . . . + AN and echelon holding cost
e1 + e2 + . . . + eN.

Concluding Remarks
We have seen that it is difﬁcult to determine optimal lot sizes for multi-echelon
inventory systems, although we have assumed given deterministic demand. In most
practical situations it is necessary to use simple approximations. However, even when
using approximations it may be possible to let theoretical results have an impact on
the heuristic rules.
For assembly systems and systems that resemble assembly systems, it is very
often practical to let upstream batch quantities be integer multiples of downstream
batch quantities, although this does not need to be optimal.
For serial and assembly systems, an optimization of the batch quantities will, in
general, lead to larger lot sizes as compared to a simple sequential technique where
different items are considered separately. Furthermore, we recall that stochastic
demand variations will also make it advantageous to use larger batch quantities
(Sect. 6.1). Note however, that these conclusions are only based on ordering costs,
holding costs and possibly shortage costs. The conclusions do not take capacity
constraints into account. In Sect. 7.2 we have discussed different possibilities to
smooth the production load. A cyclical planning system can be used to smooth the
load also in a multi-stage environment. But if it is not feasible for some reason to
use a cyclical planning system, the remaining possibility is quite often to reduce
the batch quantities in order to smooth the ﬂow of orders. This means that we have
conﬂicting goals. We wish to have large batches due to the multi-echelon structure,
but on the other hand we want to have small batches to get a smooth production
load. It is difﬁcult to know how to handle such a situation, but in general, it is more
important in practice to get smooth capacity utilization than to reduce ordering and
holding costs. See also Axsäter (1986).

Chapter 10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
This chapter deals with various techniques for determining safety stocks and reorder
points in multi-echelon inventory systems. Throughout the chapter we assume that
the batch quantities are given.
The methods for determining safety stocks and reorder points described in Chap. 5
are not directly applicable in a multi-echelon inventory system. The reason is, again,
that different installations cannot be handled separately. A fundamental problem in
connection with multi-level inventory systems is to ﬁnd the best balance between
upstream and downstream stock. As we have already discussed in Sect. 8.1, it is clear
that inventories at different levels will support each other. For example, if there is a
large safety stock of a ﬁnal product, it is possible to accept some production delays
and it may consequently be feasible to have relatively low safety stocks of different
components of the product. For inventories in a distribution system there are similar
dependencies. Consider a two-level distribution system with a central warehouse and
a number of retailers. With a large central inventory, orders from the retailers will
very seldom be delayed and it may be possible to reduce the local safety stocks at
the retailers.
In general, it is very difﬁcult to allocate safety stocks optimally in a multi-echelon
system. Quite often we have to be satisﬁed with a reasonable “second best” solution.
Still, in most situations it is important to adapt the solutions in some way to the multi-
echelon environment. See Muckstadt and Thomas (1980), and Hausman and Erkip
(1994). In those cases where no efﬁcient methods are available, it is still usually
possible to evaluate at least a few alternative solutions by simulation.
The allocation of safety stocks in a multi-stage inventory system concerns two
related questions. The ﬁrst question is how much total system safety stock is needed.
The second question is how to allocate the stock among the different installations.
For example, how much of the total safety stock should be placed early, respectively
late, in the material ﬂow. This distribution is affected by various factors. One such
factor is the structure of the system. In a distribution system (Fig. 8.2) there are few
installations early in the material ﬂow as compared to an assembly system (Fig. 8.3).
In general, it is advantageous to allocate safety stocks where there are few items with
high and relatively stable demand. This indicates that it could be more reasonable
to keep safety stock early in the material ﬂow for a distribution system than for an
assembly system.

Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
There are, however, other factors which may point in the other direction. In
production, the holding costs are often quite low early in the material ﬂow. This
means that it can be a good policy to have relatively large safety stocks of various
components in an assembly system.
The allocation of safety stocks should also be affected by the lead-times. Consider
again the distribution system in Fig. 8.2. If the warehouse lead-time is very long as
compared to the lead-times of the retailers, relatively more stock should be kept at
the warehouse.
Note also that we can improve the service in different ways. Sometimes a safety
time is a better alternative than a safety stock. This is the case for a component which
is used only a few times per year when producing a higher level item. If we use a
safety time in an MRP system, we will only stock the item during a short time just
before it is needed in production.
Safety stocks and safety times in production are largely due to uncertain lead-
times. One question that should always be raised is whether it is possible to reduce
the uncertainty and hence avoid large safety stocks. To do that it is often necessary to
have more, or possibly more ﬂexible, production capacity, so that production delays
due to various disturbances will not be too long. Safety capacity can be an alternative
to safety stocks. There will, however, always remain some uncertainty both in the
lead-times and in the demand for ﬁnal items.
10.1
The Clark-Scarf Model
The best-known technique for determining safety stocks in a multi-echelon inventory
system was presented by Clark and Scarf (1960). This was also the origin of the
echelon-inventory measure. Their method, which is exact for serial systems, can be
seen as a decomposition technique. In the ﬁrst step we consider the most downstream
installation facing customer demand. Shortages at the next upstream installation lead
to stochastic delays, which will imply certain additional costs. These additional costs
are evaluated and added as shortage costs when determining an optimal policy for
the next upstream installation.

Van Houtum (2001) and Van Houtum et al. (2007).

We assume periodic review. The continuous period demand at installation 1 is
assumed to be normally distributed and independent across periods. (It is straight-
forward to generalize to other distributions.) Demand that cannot be met directly
from stock is backordered. Installation 1 replenishes from installation 2, and instal-
lation 2 replenishes from an outside supplier with inﬁnite supply. We assume that the
lead-times (transportation times) are integral numbers of periods. There are standard
holding and backorder costs but no ordering or setup costs.
It is assumed that all events take place in the beginning of a period in the following
order:
1. Installation 2 orders.
2. The period delivery from the outside supplier arrives at installation 2.
3. Installation 1 orders from installation 2.
4. The period delivery from installation 2 arrives at installation 1.
5. The stochastic period demand takes place at installation 1.
6. Evaluation of holding and shortage costs.
We shall use the following notation:

μ

σ

y2
= echelon stock inventory position at installation 2 in period t just before the
period demand
y1
= realized (echelon stock) inventory position at installation 1 in period t + L2
just before the period demand.
The realized inventory position at installation 1 does not include outstanding orders,
which are backordered at installation 2.
Our purpose is to minimize the total expected holding and backorder costs per
period. We consider the holding costs for stock on hand at the installations, i.e., we
do not include the expected holding costs for units in transportation from installation
2 to installation 1, h2μL1. These costs are not affected by the control policy.
Recall that for installation 1 there is no difference between installation and echelon
stock, and that e1 = h1 - h2 can be interpreted as the holding cost on the value added
when going from installation 2 to installation 1.

194
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
We use the notation x+ = max (x, 0), x−= max (−x, 0), and x+ −x−= x.
Let t be an arbitrary period. After ordering in period t, installation 2 has a certain
echelon stock inventory position y2.At this stage we do not assume anything about the
orderingpolicy. Becausetheoutsidesupplierhasinﬁnitesupply, thereisnodifference
between the inventory position and the realized inventory position. Consider then
the echelon stock inventory level at installation 2 in period t + L2 just before the
period demand, ILe
2. We can express ILe
2 as ILe
2 = y2 −D(L2), i.e., y2 minus the
stochastic demand during the L2 periods t, t + 1, . . . , t + L2−1. We are then using
the standard argument that was introduced in Sect. 5.3.2. All that was included in
the inventory position after the order in period t has arrived in stock in period t + L2.
Orders after period t are still outstanding. Note that the customer demand in period
t + L2 has not taken place at this stage. D(L2) has mean μ′
2 = L2μ and standard
deviation σ ′2 = (L2)1/2σ.
Next, we consider the realized echelon stock inventory position y1 at installation 1
after ordering in period t + L2. Recall that the difference between inventory position
and realized inventory position is that the realized inventory position does not include
outstanding orders that are backordered at installation 2. Again we do not assume
anything about the ordering policy. Note, however, that whatever policy is followed
we must have
y1 ≤ILe
2 = y2 −D (L2)
(10.1)
In case of strict inequality, the difference is positive installation stock at installation
2.
The (installation stock) inventory level at installation 1 after the demand in period
t + L1 + L2 is, by using our standard argument, obtained as y1 minus the demand in
periods t + L2, t + L2 + 1, . . . , t + L2 + L1, i.e., the demand during L1 + 1 periods,
D(L1 + 1). Note that whatever policy is followed, y1 is independent of this demand,
which has mean μ′′
1 = (L1 + 1) μ and standard deviation σ ′′1 = (L1 + 1)1/2σ.
For installation 2, we shall consider the ordering in period t and the costs in period
t + L2. For installation 1, we consider the ordering in period t + L2 and the costs in
period t + L2 + L1. Note that all these periods can be seen as arbitrary periods.
The installation stock inventory on hand at installation 2 just after the order from
installation 1 is (ILi
2)
+ = ILe
2 −y1. This is then the installation inventory status at
installation 2 during the whole period.
Using this, we can now express the average holding costs at installation 2 in period
t + L2 as
C2 = h2E(ILe
2 −y1) = h2E(y2 −D(L2) −y1)
= h2(y2 −μ′
2) −h2y1.
(10.2)
Similarly, the average period costs at installation 1 (evaluated after the period demand
has taken place) in period t + L2 + L1 are obtained as
C1 = h1E((y1 −D(L1 + 1))+ + b1E((y1 −D(L1 + 1))−
= h1(y1 −μ′′
1) + (h1 + b1)E((y1 −D(L1 + 1))−.
(10.3)

10.1
The Clark-Scarf Model
195
Recall that so far, we have not assumed anything about the ordering policies used
at the two considered installations. Whatever ordering policy is used it must result
in some y2 in period t and some y1 in period t + L2. We note that the total expected
period costs are completely determined by y2 and y1, so when looking for the optimal
policy we do not need to consider any other parameters.
It is now convenient to reallocate the costs slightly. The last term in (10.2), −h2y1
is transferred to stage 1. Using that h1 −h2 = e1, we obtain:
˜C2 = h2(y2 −μ′
2),
(10.4)
and
˜C1 = e1y1 −h1μ′′
1 + (h1 + b1)E((y1 −D(L1 + 1))−).
(10.5)
Of course this reallocation does not affect the total costs. Since the transferred term
is normally negative, ˜C1 may very well also become negative.
Observe now that (10.4) is independent of y1. The costs (10.5) at stage 1 may
depend on y2 due to (10.1). However, it turns out that the optimal policy at installation
1 is independent of y2. To see this, let us for a moment forget that the realized
inventory position y1 may depend on y2. We simply assume that we can choose any
value of y1. We denote this value ˆy1. This means that we replace (10.5) by
ˆC1( ˆy1) = e1 ˆy1 −h1μ′′
1 + (h1 + b1)E(( ˆy1 −D(L1 + 1))−

Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
Consider now (10.1). If y2 −D (L2) ≥ˆy∗
1 we obtain the optimal solution if we
have y1 = ˆy∗
1. But if y2 −D (L2) < ˆy∗
1, the best possible value of y1 is y1 = y2 -
D(L2) due to the convexity of (10.6). But this optimal policy can be realized if we
apply an (echelon stock) order-up-to-S policy with Se
1 = ˆy∗
1. Note that this optimal
policy at installation 1 is completely independent of y2. Furthermore, the optimal
policy is easy to obtain from (10.8). (Recall that there is no difference between
echelon stock and installation stock at installation 1, so we can also see the obtained
policy as an installation stock policy with Si
1 = ˆy∗
1.)
Note that if e1 = 0, or equivalently if h1 = e2, (10.8) implies that Se
1 = ˆy∗
1 →∞.
This means that installation 2 will never carry any stock. To understand this, note
that in a serial system the whole consumption takes place at installation 1. If there is
no difference in holding costs, we can just as well move all stock to installation 1.
In a distribution system this is no longer the case. It can be advantageous to retain
stock at an upstream installation because it is then still possible to allocate the stock
to alternative lower level sites. See Sect. 10.1.2.
It remains to determine the optimal policy at installation 2. The only remaining
decision parameter is y2. We consider the total costs assuming that we use the optimal
policy at installation 1. We obtain the costs from (10.4) and (10.6). Since y1 = Se
1 if
D (L2) ≤y2 −Se
1, and y1 = y2 - D(L2) for D (L2) > y2 −Se
1, we have

Note that the costs in (10.9) include the costs at installation 1 under the assumption
that installation 1 uses the optimal policy. The last term in (10.9) can be seen as the
shortage costs at installation 2 induced by its inability to deliver on time to installation
1. It is easy to verify that ˆC2(y2) is convex in y2, which means that we only have to
look for a local minimum. Denote the optimal solution by y∗
2. Because the outside
supplier has inﬁnite supply it is obvious that it is optimal to apply an echelon stock
order-up-to-S policy with Se
2 = y∗
2.
Example 10.1
Consider a system with the following data: L1 = L2 = 5, μ = 10,
σ = 5, e1 = 0.5, e2 = 1, and b1 = 10. In the ﬁrst step we determine ˆC1( ˆy1)according
to (10.6). A graph is given in Fig. 10.2.
The optimal Se
1 = ˆy∗
1 = 81.0 is obtained from (10.8). The corresponding costs
are ˆC1 = −47.0.
In the next step we determine the total costs ˆC2(y2) from (10.9), see Fig. 10.3.
The optimal echelon stock order-up-to level is Se
2 = y∗
2 = 129.7, giving the total
costs ˆC2 = 39.4.
Note that the total costs are relatively ﬂat, and particularly that the costs do not
increase especially rapidly for low values of y2. This is typical for multi-echelon
inventory systems. Furthermore, optimal upstream stocks are, in general, surpris-
ingly low. The average optimal inventory level at installation 2 is Se
2 −μ′
2 −Se
1 =
129.7 −50 −81.0 = −1.3.

The described technique is easy to generalize to more than two echelons. The addi-
tional costs at installation 2 due to insufﬁcient supply are then used as the shortage
costs at installation 3, etc. It is also easy to generalize to a batch-ordering policy at
the most upstream installation (installation 2 in our case).
We have assumed echelon stock policies since this simpliﬁes the derivation. Oth-
erwise this is not important, though. As shown in Sect. 8.2.3, we can, under general
conditions, replace echelon stock S policies by equivalent installation stock S poli-
cies. The corresponding installation stock inventory positions are Si
2 = Se
2 −Se
1,
and Si
1 = Se
1. However, if we start with initial inventory positions that are above
the optimal order-up-to positions, the echelon stock policy is still optimal while the
installation stock policy may fail.
For two levels and normally distributed demand, i.e., the case that we have con-
sidered, the exact solution is relatively easy to obtain, see Federgruen and Zipkin
(1984a, b). However, in a general case the computations can be very time consum-
ing. Van Houtum and Zijm (1991) have developed approximate techniques. One
approximation is exact for demand distributions of mixed Erlang type. A different
type of approximation based on separate single-stage problems has been suggested
by Shang and Song (2003) .
It can be shown that the Clark-Scarf approach can also be used for assembly
systems. Rosling (1989) has demonstrated that an assembly system can be replaced

by an equivalent serial system when carrying out the computations. Chen and Song
(2001) have generalized the Clark-Scarf model to demand processes where demands
in different time periods may be correlated.
10.1.2
The Clark-Scarf Approach for a Distribution System
Let us now instead consider the distribution system in Fig. 10.4. It is common to
use the Clark-Scarf approach also for such systems, but the approach is then no
longer exact. The approximation is based on a so-called “balance” assumption,
which essentially means that an upstream installation is allowed to make negative
allocations to its downstream neighbors. This implies that the total stock at the
downstream neighbors can be optimally distributed between the sites in any period.
The technique was sketched in the original paper by Clark and Scarf (1960). Eppen
and Schrage (1981) used the approach in a model with identical retailers and normally
distributed demand where the central warehouse was not allowed to carry any stock.
Their model was extended in a number of ways, including non-identical retailers and
stock at the warehouse, by Federgruen and Zipkin (1984a, c). See also Federgruen
(1993), and Diks and de Kok (1998).
As in Sect. 10.1.1, let us assume periodic review and normally distributed period
demands at the retailers. The demands at the retailers are independent across periods
and retailers. The retailers replenish their stocks from the warehouse, and the ware-
house replenishes its stock from an outside supplier with inﬁnite stock. We assume
that all installations apply echelon stock order-up-to-S policies.
The warehouse is installation 0 and the retailers installations 1, 2, . . . , N. We shall
use the following notation:
L0
= lead-time (integral number of periods) for an order generated by the
warehouse
Lj
= transportation time (integral number of periods) for a delivery from the
warehouse to retailer j
Dj(n)
= stochastic demand at installation j over n periods

10.1
The Clark-Scarf Model
199
μj = average demand per period at retailer j
σj = standard deviation of the demand per period at retailer j
ej = echelon holding cost per unit and period at installation j, ej ≥0
hj = holding cost per unit and period at installation j, i.e., h0 = e0, and
hj = e0 + ej for j > 0
bj = backorder cost per unit and period at retailer j
Se
j = echelon stock order-up-to position at installation j,
yj = realized (echelon stock) inventory position at retailer j in period t + L0
just before the period demand.
A major difference compared to Sect. 10.1.1 is that we now have a number of parallel
installations at the downstream level. Otherwise we can say that the warehouse
corresponds to installation 2 and the retailers to installation 1 in Sect. 10.1.1. We
assume that all events take place in the same order as in Sect. 10.1.1.
Again we consider an arbitrary period t. The echelon stock level at the warehouse
at time t + L0, just before the period demand, is obtained as Se
0 minus the total system
demand during L0 periods, D0(L0).
We consider the costs at retailer j in period t + L0 + Lj. Using the same cost
allocation technique as in Sect. 10.1.1, we obtain the costs at the warehouse and at
retailer j in complete analogy with (10.4) and (10.5). (Recall that yj is the realized
inventory position.)

1 be the optimal solution.
In analogy with the optimal solution in the serial case, it may now seem reasonable
to allocate Se
j = ˆy∗
j to each retailer provided that the sum of all Se
j does not exceed
the echelon stock inventory level at the warehouse. This is also what we will do, but
it is important to understand that this is just an approximation.
Assume, for example, that we have only two identical retailers and that in a certain
period we are able to allocate Se
1 = Se
2 to each of them. After this allocation we get a
large period demand at retailer 2 and no demand at all at retailer 1. This means that
we would like to allocate up to Se
2 at retailer 2 in the next period. But this may not be
possible due to insufﬁcient supply at the warehouse. In that case we will get unequal
realized inventory positions at the two retailers. However, it is rather obvious that it
would be better to distribute the inventory positions equally. This might have been

200
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
possible if we had saved some more stock at the warehouse in the preceding period,
i.e., if we had not allocated Se
1 = Se
2 to both retailers. Due to this “balance” problem
the decision rule that was optimal in the serial case is now only approximate.
The considered approximation is often denoted the “balance” approximation since
it means that we disregard the possibility of unbalanced retailer inventory positions.
Another interpretation is that we also allow negative allocations from the warehouse
to the retailers. An implication is that in a two-echelon system, given this approxima-
tion and if the holding costs at all installations are the same, then there is no reason
to keep stock at the warehouse.
Let us now accept the “balance” approximation and also take into account that
we cannot always allocate Se
j to each retailer. Assume that the available amount is
v ≤Se
r = N
j=1 Se
j. Given that negative allocations are possible it is “optimal” to
solve the following myopic allocation problem:

obtained from

The “balance” assumption means that we assume that the warehouse stock can
be used more efﬁciently than what is possible in reality. Therefore, ˆC0(Se

bound for the real costs, and the optimal Se
0 is lower than what would be optimal.
When implementing the solution we cannot allocate negative quantities to the
retailers. Therefore the actual allocations are determined by solving a modiﬁed ver-
sion of the myopic allocation problem (10.13). Let xj denote the realized inventory
position at retailer j just before the allocation.

Note that ˆC′

The “balance” assumption has been used extensively in the inventory literature
and has been shown to produce solutions of very good quality in many different
situations, see for example Eppen and Schrage (1987), Federgruen and Zipkin
(1984a, b, c), Federgruen (1993), Van Houtum et al. (1996), Verrijdt and de Kok
(1996), Van der Heijden et al. (1997), Diks and de Kok (1998, 1999), Dogru et al.
(2005) and references therein. Still the “balance” assumption may be less appropriate
in situations with large differences between the retailers in terms of service require-
ments and demand characteristics. Other allocation approaches that are not based
on the “balance” assumption have been suggested by e.g., Erkip (1984), Jackson
(1988), Jackson and Muckstadt (1989), McGavin et al. (1993), Graves (1996), and
Axsäter et al. (2002).
10.2
The METRIC Approach for Distribution Systems
In multi-echelon inventory theory there are two classical approaches. One is the
Clark-Scarf technique that we considered in Sect. 10.1. The other is the so-called
METRIC approximation of Sherbrooke (1968, 2004), which has also been of great
importance for the development of the ﬁeld. In this section we will describe how this
simple technique can be applied to a two-level distribution system with independent
Poisson demand processes at the retailers, complete backordering, and one-for-one
replenishments. Warehouse backorders are ﬁlled on a ﬁrst come-ﬁrst served basis.
The structure of the inventory system is illustrated in Fig. 10.4.
A difference compared to Sect. 10.1 is that we consider continuous review policies
instead of periodic review policies. We shall choose to deal with installation stock
(S – 1, S) policies, or equivalently order-up-to-S policies. The considered policy
means that the installation stock inventory position at an installation is kept equal
to some S at all times. Because of the continuous review, each demand for a unit
at a retailer will immediately trigger an order, i.e., a corresponding demand for a
unit at the warehouse. The Poisson demand processes at the retailers are assumed
to be independent. The warehouse demand is consequently a superposition of these
independent Poisson processes and is therefore also a Poisson process.
Our assumptions of Poisson demand, continuous review, and one-for-one replen-
ishments are often reasonable for items with relatively low demand and high holding
costs. Such items are, for example, common among spare parts.
We introduce the following notation:
N
= number of retailers
Li = transportation time for an item to arrive at retailer i from the ware- house,
i.e., the lead-time if the warehouse has stock on hand
L0 = replenishment lead-time for the warehouse
λi = demand intensity at retailer i

202
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
λ0 = N
i=1 λi = demand intensity at the warehouse
Si = order-up-to installation inventory position at installation i
ILi = stochastic installation stock inventory level at installation i in steady state
W0 = stochastic delay at the warehouse in steady state due to stock-outs.
For simplicity, we suppress superscript i for installation stock, e.g., we write S0
instead of Si
0.
As explained in Sect. 8.2.3 installation stock and echelon stock policies are equiv-
alent for the considered inventory system. As a consequence, we can just as well use
the corresponding echelon stock order-up-to positions: Se
0 = N
i=0 Si, and Se
i = Si
for i > 0.
Our purpose is to evaluate the distributions of the inventory levels for given order-
ing policies. The optimization of ordering policies is considered in Sect. 10.4. For
standard cost structures with holding and backorder costs, it can be shown that the
optimal Si-levels (i = 0, 1, . . ., N) are nonnegative. We shall therefore assume that
this is the case.
When applying the METRIC approximation we ﬁrst consider the warehouse. It
is easy to determine the distribution of the warehouse inventory level exactly. The
inventory position is always S0. We use our standard approach and consider an
arbitrary time, t. At time t + L0, all that is included in the inventory position at time
t has reached the warehouse, and we can express the inventory level as S0 minus the
demand in the interval (t, t + L0], D0(L0),
IL0 (t + L0) = S0 −D0 (L0).
(10.17)
The demand in (t, t + L0] has a Poisson distribution with mean λ0L0, and we obtain
the exact steady state distribution as
P (IL0 = j) = P(D0(L0) = S0 −j) = (λ0L0)S0−j
(S0 −j)! e−λ0L0,
j ≤S0.
(10.18)
Note that this is also true if the warehouse lead-times are independent stochastic
variables with mean L0 due to Palm’s theorem, see Sect. 5.15.3.
Given the distribution of the inventory level, it is easy to determine the average
inventory on hand as
E(IL+
0 ) =
S0

j=1
j · P(IL0 = j),
(10.19)
and the average number of backorders as
E(IL−
0 ) =
−1

j=−∞
(−j) · P(IL0 = j),
(10.20)
or
E(IL−
0 ) = E(IL+
0 ) −E(IL0) = E(IL+
0 ) −(S0 −λ0L0).
(10.21)

10.2
The METRIC Approach for Distribution Systems
203
It is normally more efﬁcient to use (10.21) instead of (10.20), because we avoid an
inﬁnite sum.
The warehouse can be interpreted as an (M/D/∞) queuing system, where the
backorders are the waiting customers. This means that we can get the average delay
at the warehouse according to Little’s formula:
E(W0) = E(IL−
0 )/λ0.
(10.22)
Because of the Poisson demand at the warehouse and the ﬁrst come-ﬁrst served
assumption, the average delay is the same for all retailers.
Consider now retailer i. The retailer lead-time is stochastic due to the delays
at the warehouse. However, we already know the average lead-time ¯Li, i.e., the
transportation time plus the average delay at the warehouse:
¯Li = Li + E(W0).
(10.23)
The METRIC approximation simply means that the real stochastic lead-time is re-
placed by its mean according to (10.23). (It may appear that Palm’s theorem implies
that this is an exact approach. This is not true, though, because successive stochastic
delays at the warehouse depend on the inventory status at the warehouse and are not
independent.) Given this approximation, we have a constant lead-time and can de-
termine the distribution of the inventory level precisely as we did for the warehouse
in (10.18)
P (ILi = j) = P
+
Di( ¯Li) = Si −j
,
= (λi ¯Li)
Si−j
(Si −j)! e−λi ¯Li,
j ≤Si.
(10.24)
The determination of the average stock on hand and the average number of back-
orders parallels completely (10.19) – (10.21). Thus the approximation enables us
to decompose the problem so that all installations can be handled as single-echelon
systems. Note that the approach starts with the upstream installation. When using
the decomposition approach in Sect. 10.1 we start with the downstream installations.
Example 10.2 Considerasystemwiththefollowingdata: N = 2, L0 = L1 = L2 = 2,
λ1 = 0.1, λ2 = 0.9, S0 = 2, S1 = 1, and S2 = 4. Note ﬁrst that λ0 = λ1 + λ2 = 1.
Applying (10.18), (10.19), and (10.21) we obtain
E(IL+
0 ) =

j=1
j · P(IL0 = j) = 1 · 21

and
E(IL−
0 ) = E(IL+
0 ) −(S0 −λ0L0) = 0.541 −0 = 0.541
From (10.22) we have E(W0) = E(IL−
0 )/λ0 = 0.541, and applying (10.23) we get
¯Li = Li + E(W0) = 2.541.

For retailer 2 we similarly obtain E(IL+
2 ) = 1.837and E(IL−
2 ) = 0.124. Recall that
the results for the retailers are approximate.
The corresponding exact results are E(IL+
1 ) = 0.777, E(IL−
1 ) = 0.031,
E(IL+
2 ) = 1.866, and E(IL−
2 ) = 0.153.
It is straightforward to extend the METRIC approach to more than two levels. The
analysis is then exact at the most upstream level, while all downstream installations
are handled approximately. It is also easy to handle compound Poisson demand.
Furthermore, it is easy to generalize to a batch-ordering policy at the warehouse.
Assume that the warehouse applies an installation stock (R0, Q0) policy. The inven-
tory position at the warehouse is then in steady state uniformly distributed on the
integers R0 + 1, R0 + 2, . . . , R0 + Q0. This means that (10.18) is replaced by
P (IL0 = j) = 1
Q0
R0+Q0

k = max(j,R0+1)
(λ0L0)k−j
(k −j)! e−λ0L0,
j ≤R0 + Q0,
(10.25)
where we average over the uniformly distributed inventory position. Thereafter we
can use exactly the same procedure.
The METRIC approximation has many advantages. It is simple and computation-
ally efﬁcient. At this stage it seems to be the multi-echelon technique that has been
applied most widely in practice. There are especially many military applications
involving high-value repairable items.
It is more difﬁcult, though, to handle nonidentical batch-ordering retailers. It is
still relatively easy to determine the average delay at the warehouse. The problem
is that the retailers normally face different average delays, and it is more difﬁcult
to determine the average delay for a speciﬁc retailer. One possibility is, of course,
to disregard that the average delays are different for the retailers. This means an
additional approximation.
Quite a few approximate techniques for evaluation of general batch-ordering poli-
cies in distribution inventory systems are similar in spirit to the METRIC approach. In
a two-level system a retailer is handled as a single-echelon system but the parameters
describing this system depend on the warehouse. See further Sect. 10.5.2.2.
Muckstadt (1973) has shown how the METRIC framework can be extended to
include a hierarchical or indented-parts structure (MOD-METRIC). To illustrate the
basic idea in Muckstadt’s approach, consider a group of n items (j = 1, 2, . . ., n)
that are controlled by (S −1, S) policies in a two-level inventory system. We can use
the METRIC approach to estimate the average waiting time for item j at retailer i,

E(Wi, j). Let us furthermore assume that the considered items are exclusively used
as modules when repairing a certain assembly. Each retailer also has a stock of such
assemblies. It is assumed that the assembly is repaired by exchanging exactly one
of the items. The demand for item j at retailer i is λi, j, and the demand for repairs
at retailer i is consequently λa
i = n
j=1 λi,j. Assume that the repair time at retailer
i is Ti. We can now estimate the average repair time, including waiting time, for
modules as
¯Ti = Ti + 1

When determining a suitable inventory policy for the assembly, we can then replace
the stochastic total repair time by its mean ¯Ti. See also Rustenburg et al. (2003).

Disaggregation of Warehouse Backorders
We shall now show how we can analyze the problem in Sect. 10.2 exactly. We refer
to that section for the necessary notation. Our derivation essentially follows Graves
(1985). The ﬁrst derivation of exact steady-state inventory level distributions was
carried out by Simon (1971).
From (10.18) we have for k > 0
P (IL−
0 = k) = P(IL0 = −k) = P (D0(L0) = S0 + k) = (λ0L0)S0+k

stochastic variable.
Evidently N
i=1 Bi = IL−
0 . When a new backorder occurs, the probability that
it emanates from retailer i is λi/λ0 due to the Poisson demand. Consequently, the
conditional distribution of Bi for a given IL−
0 is binomial and we have

Now consider retailer i at some arbitrary time t when the system is in steady state.
Si – Bi units are on their way to, or already at, retailer i. At time t + Li all these units
have reached retailer i, while ordered units backordered at the warehouse at time t

206

Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
and all orders that have been triggered after time t have still not reached the retailer.
Consequently, using our standard approach we have
ILi(t + Li) = Si −Bi −Di(Li),
(10.29)
or in other words, to get the inventory level at time t + Li we subtract the demand at
retailer i in the interval (t, t + Li) from the amount on route to, or already at, retailer
i at time t. Note that the demand Di(Li) is independent of Bi. The exact distribution
of the inventory level at retailer i can therefore be obtained as
P (ILi = j) = P(Bi + Di(Li) = Si −j)

(10.30)
The considered derivation works very well for Poisson demand and one-for-one
replenishments. It is difﬁcult, though, to use the approach in more general situations
with batch-ordering retailers. The problem is that we can no longer use the binomial
disaggregation of the warehouse backorders in (10.28). See Sect. 10.5.2.3.
10.3.2
A Recursive Procedure
We shall now again solve the problem in Sect. 10.2 exactly, but in a different way. The
described procedure is a special case of a more general technique in Axsäter (2002)
that provides an exact solution for installation stock (R, Q) policies and independent
compound Poisson processes at the retailers.
Consider retailer i and the lead-time for an ordered unit. The lead-time is evidently
stochastic due to possible delays at the warehouse. The stochastic lead-time for an
ordered unit is independent of the lead-time demand. Furthermore, orders cannot
cross in time due to the ﬁrst come-ﬁrst served assumption. We have dealt with such
lead-times in Sect. 5.15.2.
Let
J = stochastic lead-time demand at retailer i when averaging over the lead-time.
It was shown in Sect. 5.15.2 that for this type of stochastic lead-time, the distribution
of the inventory level can be determined by using the relationship
P(ILi = j) = P(J = Si −j),
(10.31)
i.e., essentially in the same way as for a constant lead-time.
It remains to determine the distribution of J. Since we are dealing with (S – 1, S)
policies, each system demand triggers a retailer order for a unit that in turn, triggers
a warehouse order for a unit. Consider a warehouse order for a unit at some time t.
Because of the ﬁrst come-ﬁrst served assumption, the ordered unit will ﬁll the S0-th
retailer order for a unit at the warehouse after the order. (If S0 = 0 the ordered unit

10.3
Two Exact Techniques
207
will ﬁll the retailer order that triggered the warehouse order.) This means that the
considered ordered unit will be assigned to the retailer order triggered by the S0-th
system demand after the warehouse order. We are interested in the lead-time demand
for an order from retailer i. Therefore we consider a situation where the S0-th system
demand occurs at retailer i.
The S0-th system demand after time t can occur either before or after the ordered
unit has reached the warehouse. If the ordered unit has reached the warehouse the
retailer lead-time is Li, otherwise it is longer. Let
u(S0, j) = P(S0-th system demand occurs before the order has reached the
warehouse and J ≤j),
v(S0, j) = P(S0-th system demand occurs after the order has reached the warehouse
and J ≤j).
We can express the distribution function for J as
P(J ≤j) = u(S0, j) + v(S0, j).
(10.32)
Given u(S0, j) and v(S0, j), we can determine the distribution of the inventory level
from (10.31) and (10.32).
P (ILi = j) = P(J = Si −j)
= u(S0, Si −j) −u(S0, Si −j −1) + v(S0, Si −j) −v(S0, Si −j −1).
(10.33)
It remains to determine the probabilities u(S0, j) and v(S0, j).
It is easy to determine the probability v(S0, j). The corresponding event occurs if
there are ﬁrst at most S0−−1 system demands during the time L0, and then at most j
demands at retailer i during the lead-time Li. Because there are at most S0 - 1 system
demands during the time L0, the item is in stock at the warehouse when ordered
by retailer i. The lead-time is therefore Li. The two considered probabilities are
independent. Consequently,

We shall now show how to derive u(S0, j) recursively. If the S0-th demand arrives
before the time t + L0, there are three mutually exclusive possibilities. In all three
cases the unit ordered by retailer i will arrive at the retailer at time t + L0 + Li, i.e.,
it will not stop at the warehouse. In other words, it is ordered by retailer i before it
has reached the warehouse.
1. One possibility is that there are exactly S0 system demands during L0, and at
most j demands at retailer i during the time Li. After the item has been ordered by
retailer i there is no more system demand until the item has reached the warehouse.
This probability is given by the ﬁrst term in (10.35) below.

208
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
2. The second possibility is that there are at least S0 + 1 system demands during
L0, the (S0 + 1)-th system demand is also at retailer i, and there are at most j – 1
additional demands at retailer i before the time t + L0 + Li. The probability for
this can be expressed as (λi/λ0)u(S0 + 1, j – 1). This is the second term in (10.35).
3. The third possibility is that there are at least S0 + 1 system demands during L0,
the (S0 + 1)-th system demand is not at retailer i, and there are at most j additional
demands at retailer i before the time t + L0 + Li. The probability for this can be
expressed as ((λ0 – λi)/λ0)u(S0 + 1, j). This is the third term in (10.35).
Consequently, we have for j > 0

(10.36)
Note that u(S0, j) →0 as S0 →∞for any value of j. This follows from the
deﬁnition. We can therefore ﬁrst set u(S0′ + 1, j) = 0 for some large S0′ and all
values of j. Thereafter we can ﬁrst apply (10.36) for j = 0, and then (10.35) for
j > 0, recursively for S0 = S0′, S0′ - 1, . . . ,0. Since the coefﬁcients λi/λ0 and (λ0 -
λi)/λ0 in (10.35) and (10.36) are both strictly smaller than 1, the suggested numerical
procedure is always stable.
A related iterative procedure for the costs in case of Poisson demand and (S – 1, S)
policies is given in Axsäter (1990). Forsberg (1995) and Axsäter and Zhang (1996)
generalize this procedure to compound Poisson demand. See also Axsäter (1993),
which deals with periodic review.
Normally, it is considerably more difﬁcult to deal with models where all instal-
lations apply (R, Q) policies as compared to the simpler (S- 1, S) policies, which
we have considered in Sects. 10.2–10.3. However, the analysis of (R, Q) policies
is simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly by the important fact that the inventory positions of all
installations are uniformly distributed and independent in steady state, as in the
single-echelon case. See Sects. 10.5.2.1 and 10.5.2.4.
10.4
Optimization of Ordering Policies
When applying the Clark-Scarf approach in Sect. 10.1 we obtained the optimal policy
as part of the approach. In Sects. 10.2 and 10.3, however, we have focused on deriving
the distributions of the inventory levels. We shall now add a standard cost structure

10.4
Optimization of Ordering Policies
209
to the considered model and show how the policy can be optimized. We assume
that we have either obtained the exact probability distributions as in Sect. 10.3, or
approximate distributions as in Sect. 10.2. Let
Si = installation stock order-up-to inventory position at installation i, (i = 0, 1,
. . . , N)
hi = holding cost per unit and time unit at installation i, (i = 0, 1, . . . , N)
bi = backorder cost per unit and time unit at retailer i, (i = 1, 2, . . . , N)
C = average system costs per time unit
The holding costs at the warehouse are not affected by the retailer inventory positions
because the structure of the demand at the warehouse is not affected if we change
Si. Furthermore, the costs at retailer i are not affected by the order-up-to-inventory
positions at the other retailers. Recall that these inventory positions do not affect the
demand at the warehouse. We therefore have
C0(S0) = average holding costs per time unit at the warehouse
Ci (S0, Si) = average holding and backorder costs per time unit at retailer i, (i = 1,
2, . . . , N)
Note that we have no explicit backorder costs at the warehouse. Backorders at the
warehouse will, however, cause delays for retailer orders and thus indirectly inﬂuence
the costs at the retailers.
The warehouse costs are obtained as
C0(S0) = h0E(IL+
0 )
(10.37)
and the costs at retailer i as
Ci(S0, Si) = hiE(IL+
i ) + biE(IL−
i ).
(10.38)
The total costs can then be expressed as
C = C0(S0) +
N

i=1
Ci(S0, Si).
(10.39)
If we have determined the distribution of the inventory levels approximately as in
Sect. 10.2, or exactly as in Sect. 10.3.1 or 10.3.2, it is easy to evaluate these costs.
See (10.19) – (10.21). Recall that is more efﬁcient to apply (10.21) than (10.20). It
can be shown that the optimal order-up-to-levels must be nonnegative.
Consider now the costs at retailer i for a given value of S0. It follows from the
results in Sect. 5.9 that if the retailer lead-time were constant, the retailer costs would
be convex in Si. This implies directly that Ci (S0, Si) is convex in Si when using
the approximate technique in Sect. 10.2, since we are then replacing the stochastic
retailer lead-time by its mean. But this convexity is also true in the exact case. To
see this, recall that the lead-time for an ordered unit is independent of the lead-
time demand, and that orders cannot cross in time. This means, as explained in
Sect. 5.15.2, that the costs Ci(S0, Si) can be seen as an average of costs for different
constant lead-times, which implies convexity in Si.

210
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
Furthermore, it is easy to ﬁnd lower and upper bounds for the optimal Si. A lower
bound, Sℓ
i , can be found by optimizing Si for the shortest possible deterministic
lead-time, Li, and an upper bound, Su
i , by optimizing Si for the longest possible
lead-time, L0 +Li.
For a given S0, we can ﬁnd the corresponding optimal S∗
i (S0)by a simple local
search where, starting with Si = Sℓ
i , we successively increase Si by one unit at a
time until we ﬁnd a local minimum of Ci (S0, Si). Note that this optimization can be
done separately for each retailer.
The optimization of C with respect to S0 is not that simple, though, since
C(S0) = C0(S0) +
N

i=1
Ci(S0, S∗
i (S0)),
(10.40)
is not necessarily convex in S0. We can, however, ﬁnd a lower bound, Sℓ
0, by opti-
mizing (10.39) with respect to S0 for Si = Su
i , and similarly, an upper bound, Su
0, by
optimizing S0 for Si = Sℓ
i . To ﬁnd the optimal S0 we then need to evaluate the costs
(10.40) for all values of S0 within these bounds. See Axsäter (1990) for details.
An optimization of the reorder points when the installations apply installation
stock (R, Q) policies can normally be carried out in essentially the same way. An op-
timization of echelon stock (R, Q) policies requires some modiﬁcations. See Axsäter
(1997) or Chen and Zheng (1997) .
A joint optimization of reorder points and batch quantities is more complex,
though. It is therefore most common to determine the batch quantities in advance
from a deterministic model. Recall that this is also the standard procedure for single-
echelon systems and that the resulting errors are usually very limited.
10.5
Batch-Ordering Policies
10.5.1
Serial System
We shall now generalize the model in Sect. 10.1.1 by considering more general ech-
elon stock (R, Q) policies. As in Sect. 10.1.1, we shall deal with normally distributed
demand, periodic review, and the two-level serial system in Fig. 10.1. The events in
a period also take place in the same order, i.e.,
1. Installation 2 orders.
2. The period delivery from the outside supplier arrives at installation 2.
3. Installation 1 orders from installation 2.
4. The period delivery from installation 2 arrives at installation 1.
5. The stochastic period demand takes place at installation 1.
6. Evaluation of holding and shortage costs.
Let
Li = lead-time (transportation time) for replenishments at installation i

Qi

Fi(x) = distribution function of the echelon stock inventory level at inst- allation i
fi(x)
= density of the echelon stock inventory level at installation i
We make the assumption that Q2 as well as the initial installation stock at installation
2 are integer multiples of Q1. This means that the installation stock inventory level at
installation 2 is a multiple of Q1at all times. Recall from Sect. 8.2.3 that, given these
assumptions, the class of echelon stock reorder point policies contains the class of
installation stock reorder point policies as a subset. Furthermore, Chen (2000) has
shown that echelon stock (R, Q) policies are optimal for serial systems under quite
general conditions.
We shall derive the probability distributions of the echelon stock inventory levels.
The derivation essentially follows Chen and Zheng (1994).
Note ﬁrst that the echelon stock inventory status of installation 2 completely
parallels the status of a single-echelon inventory, see Sect. 5.3. Consider an arbitrary
period, t. The echelon stock inventory position just after a possible order in period t
(before the demand), IP e−
2 (t), is in steady state uniformly distributed on the interval
(R2, R2 + Q2). The echelon stock inventory level in period t + L2 after the period
demand, ILe
2(t + L2), is obtained by subtracting the demands in periods t, t + 1,
. . . ,t + L2, i.e., the demands during L2 + 1 periods, D(L2 + 1),
ILe
2(t + L2) = IP e−
2 (t) −D(L2 + 1).
(10.41)
The demand during L2 + 1 periods has mean μ′′
2 = (L2+1)μ and standard deviation
σ ′′2 = (L2 + 1)1/2σ. In complete analogy with (5.42) we now obtain

(10.42)
Given F2(x), we can, for example, evaluate the echelon holding costs at installation
2.
Installation 1 orders from installation 2 before the demand in period t + L2. We
are therefore also interested in the distribution of the inventory level at this point
in time. Let ILe−
2 be the inventory level and F −
2 (x) the corresponding distribution
function. The only difference compared to (10.42) is that μ′′

Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
The inventory position at installation 1, IP1, after the review with the possibility to
order is always in the interval (R1, R1 + Q1]. Consequently, if ILe−
2
≤R1, we know
that there is no installation stock at installation 2 after the review of the inventory
position at installation 1. All stock included in ILe−
2 must be on its way to, or already
at, installation 1. The other possibility is that ILe−
2
> R1. Recall now that the
installation inventory level at installation 2 after the review at installation 1 is always
a multiple of Q1, say jQ1. We have jQ1 = ILe−
2 −IP1 > R1 −(R1 + Q1) = −Q1
since IP1 ≤R1+Q1. But this means that j ≥0. Consequently, there are no backorders
at installation 2 and all stock included in IP1 must be on its way to, or already at,
installation 1. Note that given ILe−
2 , we can obtain IP1 uniquely from the conditions
IP1 = ILe−
2 −jQ1 and R1 < IP1 ≤R1 + Q1 since the second condition determines
j uniquely. Let us denote the resulting j by ˆj.
We can conclude that the realized inventory position, i.e., the stock on its way to,
or already at, installation 1 can be expressed as

t + L2 + 1, . . . ,t + L1 + L2, i.e., the demand during L1 + 1 periods, D(L1 + 1) with

10.5.2
Distribution System
Let us now again consider the two-echelon distribution system in Fig. 10.5.
We have considered the evaluation of order-up-to-S policies in such inventory
systems in Sects. 10.1.2, 10.2, and 10.3. We shall now, as in Sect. 10.5.1, consider
more general batch-ordering policies. But in contrast to Sect. 10.5.1, we shall mainly
deal with continuous review policies.
We start by providing some basic results in Sect. 10.5.2.1. Thereafter we discuss,
in Sects. 10.5.2.2–10.5.2.5, different approaches for evaluation of batch-ordering
policies.

Some Basic Results
Let us ﬁrst consider a simple special case. Assume that all retailers apply S-policies.
This means that their inventory positions are kept constant, and there is no difference
between an echelon stock ( Re
0, Q0) policy and an installation stock ( Ri
0, Q0) policy
at the warehouse. The difference between the echelon stock inventory position and
the installation stock inventory position at the warehouse is simply the sum of the
constant retailer inventory positions. So although we shall consider installation stock
policies, the following is also true for echelon stock policies.
Consider ﬁrst the case when also the warehouse applies an installation stock S
policy. Let
C(Si
0, Si
1, ..., Si
N) = total system costs per time unit for a given installation stock S
policy.
Assume that these costs can be evaluated for different policies using the techniques
in Sects. 10.1–10.3. Consider then instead an ( Ri
0, Q0) policy at the warehouse. For
discrete integral demand this means that the warehouse inventory position is uniform
on [ Ri
0 +1, Ri
0 +2, ..., Ri
0 +Q0] and we obtain the total costs for the ( Ri
0, Q0) policy
at the warehouse by simply averaging over these inventory positions.

(10.47)
This means that it is easy to evaluate and optimize the ordering policy. Note also that
we can, in a sense, force the retailers to order in “batches” while still using a simple
S policy, if we use periodic review with a suitably long review period.
Although multi-echelon inventory systems with general batch-ordering policies
are difﬁcult to analyze, there are some important properties of single-echelon inven-
tory systems that carry over to the multi-echelon case. One such property concerns
the uniform distribution of the inventory position when using (R, Q) policies.
Consider ﬁrst a distribution system with discrete demand (for example compound
Poisson demand), where all installations apply installation stock (R, Q) policies. Let
q be the largest common factor of all batch quantities Q0, Q1, . . . ,QN. It is evident

214
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
that all replenishments and all demands at the warehouse are multiples of q. Therefore
it is natural to assume that also the warehouse reorder point Ri
0, as well as the initial
inventory position at the warehouse are multiples of q. Let us furthermore assume
that not all customer demands are multiples of some unit larger than one. Under these
assumptions we have the following simple result (see e.g., Axsäter, 1998).
Proposition 10.1 (Installation stock (R, Q) policies.)
In steady state the instal-
lation stock inventory positions are independent. The warehouse installation stock
inventory position is uniform on [ Ri
0 + q, Ri
0 + 2q, . . . , Ri
0 + Q0], and the retailer
installation stock inventory positions are uniform on [ Ri
j + 1, Ri
j + 2, ..., Ri
j + Qj].
Consider then the same system with echelon stock (R, Q) policies instead of
installation stock policies. We then have
Proposition 10.2 (Echelon stock (R, Q) policies.)
In steady state all installa-
tions have their echelon inventory positions uniformly distributed on [ Re
j + 1, Re
j +
2, . . . , Re
j + Qj], i.e., also the warehouse. The retailer inventory positions are still
independent of each other, but the warehouse echelon stock inventory position is
correlated to the retailer inventory positions.
The coupling between the warehouse echelon stock inventory position and the
retailer inventory positions depends on the initial stock at the warehouse. SeeAxsäter
(1997), and Chen and Zheng (1997) .
Recall that when dealing with batch-ordering policies a standard approach is to
determine the batch quantities from a deterministic model in an initial step. This is a
major simpliﬁcation. The remaining main difﬁculty is the policy evaluation. Given
a suitable evaluation method we can normally optimize the reorder points in the
same way as the order-up-to inventory positions when dealing with S policies. See
Sect. 10.4.
In the following wegiveanoverviewofhowdifferentresearchershaveapproached
the policy evaluation problem for distribution systems with general batch-ordering
policies. To avoid getting involved in too many technical details, we shall only sketch
the basic ideas behind different approaches.
10.5.2.2
METRIC Type Approximations
As we have already discussed in Sect. 10.2, several authors have tried to generalize
the METRIC approach to batch ordering retailers. Recall that the METRIC approach
means that we evaluate the average delay for retailer orders due to shortages at the
warehouse. This average delay is added to the retailer transportation times to get exact
average lead-times for the retailers. When evaluating the costs at the retailers, these
averages are, as an approximation, used instead of the real stochastic lead-times.
When dealing with different batch-ordering retailers it is still easy to determine
the average backorder level at the warehouse, and to obtain the average delay at the
warehouse by applying Little’s formula. This delay, however, is an average over all
retailers. A problem in connection with this approach is that the average delays may
vary substantially between the retailers. Of course the average delays are the same
in the special case of identical retailers.

10.5
Batch-Ordering Policies
215
The ﬁrst METRIC type approach for batch-ordering retailers was by Deuermeyer
and Schwarz (1981). They ﬁrst approximate the mean and variance of the warehouse
lead-time demand and ﬁt a normal distribution to these parameters. Next they esti-
mate holding costs and the average delay at the warehouse. The retailer lead-times
are, as in METRIC, obtained as the transportation times plus the average delay at
the warehouse. Svoronos and Zipkin (1988) use a different type of second moment
approximation. Except for the average warehouse delay, they also derive an approx-
imate estimate of the variance of the delay. Using these parameters they then ﬁt
a negative binomial distribution to the retailer lead-time demand. Another related
technique is suggested in Axsäter (2002).
A METRIC type approximation is quite simple. It means essentially that a multi-
echelon system is decomposed into a number of single-echelon systems. Although
the errors may be substantial in some cases, the approach is also often reasonable in
practical applications.

Disaggregation of Warehouse Backorders
Another possibility is to use the approach in Sect. 10.3.1. This approach is similar
to our standard approach for single-echelon systems. For a single-echelon system
we get the inventory level at time t + L as the inventory position at time t minus the
lead-time demand. When dealing with retailer i in the considered two-echelon distri-
bution inventory system, we also need to subtract the backorders at the warehouse at
time t, which emanates from retailer i. These backorders cannot be delivered before
time t + Li. This means that we need to disaggregate the total number of backorders
to obtain the distribution of the backorders that emanate from a certain retailer. In the
case of Poisson demand and one-for-one replenishments, a binomial disaggregation
is exact and it is relatively easy to evaluate a policy exactly as shown in Sect. 10.3.1.
In the case of batch-ordering retailers, an exact disaggregation is much more compli-
cated. Chen and Zheng (1997) have still been able to derive an exact solution this way
for echelon stock (R, Q) policies and Poisson demand. Lee and Moinzadeh (1987a,
b), and Moinzadeh and Lee (1986) approximate the demand process at the warehouse
by a Poisson process. Using this approximation they determine the distribution of
the total number of outstanding orders at all retailers. Next the mean and variance of
the number of outstanding orders at a single retailer are obtained by an approximate
disaggregation procedure. They then use different two-moment approximations of
the distribution of outstanding orders at the retailer. Axsäter (1995) is another related
approach.
10.5.2.4
Following Supply Units through the System
A third possible approach is to try to keep track of each supply unit as it moves through
the system. A batch is then seen as a “package” of individual units. This approach is
relatedtothetechniqueforone-for-oneorderingpoliciesdescribedinSect.10.3.2and

216
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
to Axsäter (1990). Using this technique Axsäter (2000) derives the exact probability
distributions for the inventory levels for a quite general continuous review multi-
echelon inventory system with batch-ordering retailers facing compound Poisson
demand. Related papers, which also deal with batch-ordering policies, are Axsäter
(1993a, b, 1997, 1998, 2003), Forsberg (1997a, b), and Andersson (1997). See also
Muharremoglu and Tsitsiklis (2003) .
Marklund (2002, 2005), Cachon (2001), Cachon and Fisher (2000), and Axsäter
and Marklund (2005) use related approaches for evaluating different types of policies.
The policy considered in Axsäter and Marklund (2005) will always outperform both
installation stock and echelon stock (R, Q) policies.
Using this type of techniques exact policy evaluations are possible as long as we
deal with relatively small problems characterized by low demand and corresponding
small batch quantities. For larger problems the computational effort grows quite
rapidly and it is more realistic to rely on approximate techniques.
10.5.2.5
Practical Considerations
It is clear that the research concerning evaluation and optimization of distribution
inventory systems with stochastic demand has made a lot of progress during the past
two decades. It is possible to handle a wider range of systems exactly, and we have
better approximate techniques for systems which cannot be analyzed exactly.
Numerical experimentation with various test problems in many research papers
has also illustrated what a typical optimal solution looks like. See e.g., Muckstadt
and Thomas (1980), Axsäter (1993b, 2000), Hausman and Erkip (1994), Andersson
(1997), and Gallego and Zipkin (1999). The optimal solution of a particular problem
will, of course, depend on problem parameters like holding costs, backorder costs
(or service constraints), transportation times, and demand processes. Although it is
difﬁcult to generalize, it is striking that the optimal solutions very often look the
same in a certain sense. What is typical is that upstream installations should have
very low stocks compared to downstream installations. Consider, for example, a
distribution inventory system with a central warehouse and about ﬁve retailers. Let
us assume that the retailers are required to provide a ﬁll rate of 95 % towards the
ﬁnal customers. The optimal solution may then typically show that we should have
a negative safety stock at the warehouse, and that the warehouse ﬁll rate for orders
from the retailers should be something like 50 %. A ﬁrst important question is how
this knowledge can be used for more efﬁcient control of practical supply chains.
In practice it is still most common to handle different stocks in a supply chain by
single-echelon techniques. As discussed in Sect. 10.5.2.2, it may then be possible to
use some simple type of METRIC approximation.
Quiteoftenpractitionershandleupstreamanddownstreamstockpointsinasimilar
way. This means generally that the distribution of the total stock between upstream
and downstream installations is far from optimal. One way to achieve better control is,
of course, to implement exact or approximate techniques for multi-echelon inventory
systems. However, it may be difﬁcult to replace an existing simple control system

with a relatively advanced multi-echelon technique. The computational effort will
also grow considerably. In the short run it may be more realistic to implement the
new knowledge in the following way: (i) Analyze a small number of representative
items by multi-echelon techniques, and (ii) Adjust the service levels in the existing
control system so that they roughly correspond to the optimal solution.

10.6.1
Guaranteed Service Model Approach
We shall now consider a relatively simple approximate approach for setting order-
up-to inventory positions in a multi-echelon inventory system. The advantage of the
approach is its simplicity, while it is difﬁcult to see how the approximations will af-
fect the results. The general approach was ﬁrst suggested by Kimball in 1955. (This
manuscript was later reprinted in Kimball 1988.) The most well-known early paper
dealing with this topic is Simpson (1958), who used the technique for determining
safety stocks in a serial inventory system. Various generalizations have been pro-
vided by Graves (1988), Inderfurth (1991), and Inderfurth and Minner (1998). The
presentation here follows essentially Graves and Willems (2003).
We assume continuous review. Let
μj
= mean demand per unit of time at installation j
σj
= standard deviation of demand per unit of time at installation j
Sj
= order-up-to inventory position at installation j
sout
j
= service time provided by installation j to its downstream installations
sin

Lj
= processing time at installation j
kj
= safety factor for installation j
p(j) = the set of installations which are immediate predecessors of installation j
Ij
= on-hand inventory at installation j
Consider installation j. It is assumed that the service times provided by installations
that are immediate predecessors, sout
i
for i ∈p(j), have been determined. The service
time, or delay, for installation j from upstream installations is then
sin

(10.48)
The corresponding lead-time for replenishments is obtained as Lj +sin
j . The average
demand during this time is μj(Lj +sin
j ), and the standard deviation σj(Lj + σ in
j )
1/2.
A standard procedure for setting the order-up-to inventory position so that a delivery
from stock (i.e., sout
j
= 0) is possible with a high probability is
S′
j = μj(Lj + sin
j ) + kjσj(Lj + sin
j )
1/2,
(10.49)

218
10
Multi-Echelon Systems: Reorder Points
where kj is the so-called safety factor. In case of unbounded demand, we will of
course, not always be able to deliver immediately from stock, but we shall still
interpret (10.49) as the order-up-to inventory position that will provide sout
j
= 0.
Let us now instead assume that we can accept a positive service time towards
downstream installations, i.e., some sout
j
> 0. This is equivalent to reducing the
lead-time by sout
j
in (10.49). This simple result, which was ﬁrst pointed out by
Hariharan and Zipkin (1995), is easy to derive. We obtain the corresponding Sj as
Sj = μj(Lj + sin
j −sout
j ) + kjσj(Lj + sin
j −sout
j )
1/2.
(10.50)
In (10.50) we must require that sout
j
≤Lj + sin
j .
Given (10.50) we can approximate the expected inventory on hand at installation
j as
E(Ij) = kjσj(Lj + sin
j −sout
j )
1/2.
(10.51)
Using the considered approach in a decentralized setting, each site can successively
set its service time towards downstream sites and determine the corresponding order-
up-to inventory position Sj.
We can also include (10.51) in a safety stock optimization.Assume that the service
times provided by external suppliers are given. Furthermore, for sites facing customer
demand there are required service times towards the customers. Using (10.48) and
(10.51) we can then, for example, minimize the total holding costs with respect to
the internal service times, sout
j , provided by sites not facing demand from external
customers.
10.6.2
Coordination and Contracts
In practice it is common with supply chains, which consist of several independent
ﬁrms. So far in this book we have assumed that all information concerning the supply
chain is available and that our purpose is to optimize the total supply chain. So we
have adopted the perspective of a central planner.
However, it is obvious that this perspective is not always relevant. A company that
is part of a supply chain quite often wishes to limit the information that is available
for other companies. An interesting question is then to which extent this limits
the possibilities for improved control. It is clear that extensive information sharing
becomesmoreandmorecommoninsupplychains.Anexampleistheimplementation
of so-called vendor managed inventory (VMI) programs. In such implementations
the supplier may have access to real-time sales data at its downstream installation.
This puts, in a sense, the supplier in the position of a central planner.
Furthermore, a company in a supply chain may be more interested in its own
objectives than in the objectives of the total supply chain. This may lead to additional
costs due to sub-optimization. A question here is whether such incentive conﬂicts
can be resolved by agreements or contracts that guarantee good coordination, while
still allowing decentralized planning and control.

10.6
Other Assumptions
219
There is a rich and rapidly growing literature on information sharing, coordination,
and contracts. We refer to two recent overviews in Cachon (2003) and Chen (2003)
for more details and additional references.
We shall in this section illustrate modeling and analysis of contracts by considering
a simpliﬁed version of an example that is discussed in Cachon (2003).
10.6.2.1
The Newsboy Problem with Two Firms
We return to the newsboy problem that we dealt with in Sect. 5.13. However, we now
assume that the distribution is handled by two independent ﬁrms, a supplier and a
retailer. The two ﬁrms want to maximize their own proﬁts.
The supplier has a certain given production cost per unit. The retailer orders from
the supplier and faces a newsboy problem. There is a single season and the demand
is normally distributed. (Other distributions can be handled in the same way.) There
is a certain given market price per unit. The retailer is not paid anything for unsold
units. Let us introduce the following notation:
c = given production cost per unit for the supplier
p = given market price per unit
S = amount ordered by the retailer
μ = mean of stochastic demand
σ = standard deviation of stochastic demand
q = expected sales
It is evident that we must assume that p > c. Otherwise no business will take place.
10.6.2.2
Wholesale-Price Contract
Let us ﬁrst consider a so-called wholesale-price contract. This means that the supplier
decides on a price per unit that the retailer has to pay. Let us introduce the following
additional notation.
w = price per unit charged by the supplier and paid by the retailer
πs = expected proﬁt for the supplier
πr = expected proﬁt for the retailer
Π = expected total proﬁt
Consider ﬁrst the retailer proﬁt:

(10.55)
Note that we can assume c < w < p. If c ≥w there is no supplier proﬁt, and if w ≥p
it is optimal for the retailer to choose S = 0.
Let us now ﬁrst consider the total proﬁt. The problem to maximize the total proﬁt
is equivalent to the original newsboy problem in Sect. 5.13. Note that Π = (p – c)μ -
C, where C is the cost in (5.89) with co = c and cu = p - c. So, proﬁt maximization
with respect to S is equivalent to cost minimization.
The optimal S is obtained from
	
S −μ

(10.56)
This condition is easy to derive from (10.55) and equivalent to (5.91). The optimal
S is denoted S∗(c).
Consider then the expected retailer proﬁt. The structure of (10.52) is completely
equivalent to (10.55) so we obtain the minimizing S∗(w) from
	
S −μ

.
(10.57)
It is easy to see that S∗(w) < S∗(c) because w > c. The considered contract will
therefore fail in the sense that it will not lead to a maximization of the total proﬁt.
Assuming that the retailer uses S∗(w), the supplier can maximize her proﬁt by
maximizing
πs = (w −c)S∗(w).
(10.58)

Problems
221
10.6.2.3
Buyback Contract
Let us now consider a different type of contract. The supplier still charges the retailer
a certain price per unit purchased. However, he also pays the retailer a certain amount
per unit of leftover inventory. Let
wb = rice per unit charged by the supplier and paid by the retailer
b
= compensation per unit for leftover inventory
˜πs = expected proﬁt for the supplier
˜πr = expected proﬁt for the retailer
Π = expected total proﬁt
It is obvious that we should require b ≤wb. Otherwise, the retailer earns proﬁt from
leftover inventory. We shall choose the parameters b and wb as
b = (1 −λ)p,
wb = (1 −λ)p + λc,
(10.59)
where 0 < λ < 1. We get
˜πr = pq −Swb + b(S −q) = λpq −λSc = λΠ,
(10.60)
and
˜πs = S(wb −c) −b(S −q) = (1 −λ)pq −(1 −λ)Sc = (1 −λ)Π.
(10.61)
We can conclude that the considered contract coordinates the supply chain in the
sense that both the supplier and the retailer wish to maximize the total proﬁt. For
both ﬁrms it is rational to use S∗(c) obtained from (10.56). We can interpret λ as the
retailer’s share of the total supply chain’s proﬁt. It is reasonable for both ﬁrms to
accept the cost structure (10.59) and only negotiate about the value of λ.

Chapter 11
Implementation
In Chaps. 2–10 we have described different methods for forecasting and inventory
control. An inventory control system is usually based on a suitable selection of
these methods. However, efﬁcient algorithms cannot guarantee successful control.
It is also necessary to create a good environment for practical application of the
methods. This means, for example, correct inventory records and sound objectives
for the control. Section 11.1 deals with various prerequisites for implementation of
inventory control. In order to succeed, it is also necessary to understand how different
control parameters like holding costs and service levels can be used for adjusting the
control system. The implementation process, as well as adjustments of the control
system, should be planned carefully and it is very important to monitor the results
closely. We discuss issues concerning implementation and adjustments in Sect. 11.2.
11.1
Preconditions for Inventory Control
Due to the development of modern information technology, an inventory control
system is today usually computerized. There still exist, though, environments where
it is more suitable to use simple manual systems. One example can be an inventory
control system for items of low value such as ofﬁce supplies or bolts. It can also
be reasonable to use a manual control system when dealing with very few items.
When discussing various practical aspects of inventory control, we shall, however,
primarily think of a computerized system with many items.
11.1.1
Inventory Records
To be able to use an inventory control model it is ﬁrst of all necessary to have the
required data available. This includes stock on hand, stock on order, backorders,
various costs, lead-times, etc. If these data contain errors, the inventory control
systemwillnotbeabletotriggerordersasintended. Whenimplementinganinventory

control system it is therefore vital to have good procedures for keeping the inventory
records accurate.
In general, it is especially difﬁcult to keep track of the inventory position due to
frequent receipts and deliveries of material.All such transactions are possible sources
of errors. When an error has occurred, it can often affect the inventory control for a
long time. There are two ways to overcome such problems. The ﬁrst way is to improve
the procedures for updating the records in connection with various transactions. In
that way we can avoid having errors occur. The second way is to develop a good
system for auditing and correcting inventory records.
11.1.1.1
Updating Inventory Records
To keep the records accurate it is, of course, necessary to have correct procedures
for updating the records in connection with different transactions. However, this is
usually not the main problem. Instead the difﬁculty often lies in making sure that the
procedures are followed. The most common source of error is, without any doubt,
that transactions take place without being recorded properly.
The behavior of the personnel involved is obviously very important. First of all, the
stockroom supervisors must take full responsibility for maintaining record accuracy.
All personnel must be instructed and trained in stockroom operating procedures.
The training should also provide motivation for keeping the records accurate. It is
important to set accuracy goals and to measure the fulﬁllment of these goals. Errors
that occur should be traced and analyzed. It is usually efﬁcient to limit and control
access to the storeroom. This can prevent most undocumented transactions.
Various types of automatic identiﬁcation systems may reduce the errors consider-
ably. The less you rely on human intervention to input information the more accurate
your records will be. Automatic identiﬁcation will also reduce the time needed for
updating records. A major tool is bar coding, which is an optical method that relies
on light being reﬂected off of a printed pattern. In connection with inventory control
it is most common with one dimensional, linear bar coding. A system includes the
bar code itself, a reading device (scanner), and a printer. Bar coding is not the only
automated technique of identifying inventory. There is also, for example, optical
character reading, machine vision, magnetic stripe, and radio frequency tags.
All parts should be identiﬁed by number and location in the storeroom. A well-
ordered storage room will reduce problems involving lost and misplaced items.
It is easier to keep the records accurate if the items have ﬁxed locations. This
means that each item has a home and that nothing else can live there. On the other
hand, such a system can lead to inefﬁcient space utilization. This is because you
need to allocate space for each item corresponding to the largest quantity of the item
that may be in the facility at one time. With random location the same item can be
stored in more than one location. However, it is then necessary to accurately note
the location in a computer data-base. Although space can be used very efﬁciently
when using a random locator system, it is obvious that such a system will further
increase the need for good operating procedures. In practice it is very common to

11.1
Preconditions for Inventory Control
225
use combination systems, where some items are given speciﬁc locations, while most
items are randomly located.
For items where the stock always consists of an integral number of units, it should,
in principle, be possible to eliminate nearly all sources of errors. This can be more
difﬁcult for items which can have a continuous stock level that is obtained, for
example, by weighing. Each transaction may then cause a small error in the stock
level due to measurement errors.
Another type of problem occurs, when we have, for example, a stock of tubes of
a certain dimension. The tubes in stock may have different lengths. Furthermore, it
may be the case that short tubes cannot cover certain types of demands. Therefore,
in situations with many short tubes in stock, the inventory on hand may appear to be
much larger than it really is.
For certain types of items, thefts may be a major problem. Apart from the loss
in value, thefts will also lead to inaccurate inventory records. Thefts can be another
strong reason for limiting access to the storeroom.
11.1.1.2
Auditing and Correcting Inventory Records
All inventory balances must also be checked by counting. The counting frequency
should, in general, be higher for items with high demand. For such items the trans-
actions are more frequent, and it is usually also more important to have accurate
balances.
Traditionally it has been most common to use periodic counting, for example to
take an annual physical inventory. This usually means a complete count of more or
less all items over a short time period. It is common that the stock of each item is
counted twice by different persons.
It has become more and more common, though, to replace the periodic counting by
cycle counting. Each day a limited number of items are checked. This method means
a continuous counting of stock throughout the year. As a consequence, personnel can
be assigned to counting on a full-time basis which permits the use of specialists. It
is practical to let the inventory control system trigger counts at suitable times. It is,
of course, easier to check the stock level when it is low. Therefore it may be suitable
to count the items just before a replenishment is received. The stock level is then, on
average, equal to the safety stock. It is also common to perform a count when the
balance on hand becomes zero or negative, or after a certain number of transactions.
The inventory records are not always updated exactly when the physical move-
ments take place. The resulting differences in records must be taken into account.
Therefore it is often practical to count when there is no movement of paper or product,
for example, at end of business day, prior to start of day, or over the weekend.
Initially, or when having problems with inventory records, it may be a good idea
to count a control group of items very often. Let, for example, the control group
consists of 100 items that constitute a good cross-section of the total population of

226
11
Implementation
items, and let the cycle for each item be 10 days. By following the control group in
detail you will usually be able to identify major errors that may occur. This will, in
turn, enable adjustments of the procedures that will correct these errors.
11.1.2
Performance Evaluation
The purpose of an inventory control system is, in general, to reduce holding and
ordering costs while still maintaining satisfactory customer service. To achieve this
it is necessary to be able to continuously evaluate the performance of the system. A
performance evaluation is needed both for creating motivation for efﬁcient applica-
tion of the system and for being able to adjust the control when various changes in
the operating conditions occur.
A good system for performance evaluation should satisfy several important re-
quirements. First of all it is necessary to measure costs and service in a well-deﬁned
way so that measurements at different times can be compared. Some performance
measures are not always easy to deﬁne suitably. Customer service, for example, can
be evaluated in many ways. It is, of course, a clear advantage if the measured service
is deﬁned in the same way as the service level used when determining the reorder
levels in the inventory control system. It is then much easier to check that the control
system works as intended.
Except for the customer service, it is in general necessary to monitor the capital
tied up in inventories and the ordering costs. It is also common to evaluate other
performance measures like inventory turnover. Usually it is not very difﬁcult to
determine suitable performance measures. It is more difﬁcult to determine the level
of aggregation for the measurements. There are often many thousands of items. It is
therefore not practical to follow individual items separately. Neither is it appropriate
to aggregate all items. It should be possible to use the evaluation system as a tool for
identifying various problems that may exist. For example, we want to know whether
the control is inadequate for certain types of items, and we would also like to identify
major savings that can be achieved by improved control.
To obtain a reasonable overview it is necessary to aggregate and consider suitable
groups of items instead of individual items. It is normally advantageous if the items in
such a group are related and if the inventory control is similar. See also Sect. 11.2.2.
The performance evaluation should initially be carried out for relatively large groups
of items which are then, if required, divided into smaller groups. Even with a well-
designed system for performance evaluation, it may sometimes be quite difﬁcult to
evaluate the efﬁciency of the inventory control system. The measurements are often
affected by various changes in the operating environment. Such changes can be due
to new suppliers, major changes in the demands for different items, business cycles,
etc. It is important to be aware of possible measurement errors and take them into
account when interpreting the results of the evaluation. Even more difﬁcult is to
compare various performance measures across different companies. Two companies

may, at a ﬁrst glance, seem to have very similar conditions for inventory control.
However, when looking at the conditions in more detail, it often turns out that it is
very difﬁcult to compare performance measures like inventory turnover.
11.2
Development and Adjustments
An industrial computerized inventory system generally contains much more than the
inventory control, e.g., customer billing and supplier payments. The total system is
often more an information system than a control system, and the inventory control
module is only a minor part of the entire system. An example is an inventory control
module in a modern ERP system. (See Sect. 8.2.4.) Furthermore, it is not uncom-
mon that major parts of the inventory system already exist when starting to develop
or install a module for inventory control. In such situations the development and
installation costs can be surprisingly low.
11.2.1
Determine the Needs
Developing and implementing inventory control is a customizing operation. The re-
quirements can vary substantially between different companies and between different
types of items within a company. Sometimes it can, at least initially, be reasonable
to leave items with very special requirements outside the system.
At this stage it is recommended to question more or less everything. The very ﬁrst
question is what items that should be kept in stock at all. Maybe it is advantageous
to deliver some items only after receiving customer orders. Nearly everything can be
changed. For example, investments in production can reduce the setup times. This
means that smaller batch quantities are feasible and it may also be possible to use a
simpler replenishment system. The evaluation of such investments has been consid-
ered by e.g., Porteus (1985, 1986a, b), Silver (1992) and Spence and Porteus (1987).
Furthermore, better information can sometimes reduce the service needs. If the
inventory system can provide customers with precise information concerning the
lengths of various delays, this can enable the customers to revise their plans in such
a way that the additional costs in connection with delays are relatively low. This will
consequently reduce the need for a high service level and thereby make it possible
to obtain lower carrying costs.
When designing an inventory control system it is also necessary to determine
which control methods should be used for different groups of items. A ﬁrst important
question is whether we are dealing with a single installation and items that can be
controlled independently of each other. If this is the case, at least approximately, it
is possible to use the methods which we have considered in Chaps. 4–6, and it is, in
general, relatively easy to obtain efﬁcient inventory control.

228
11
Implementation
If the operating conditions are more complex so that we need to use methods
from Chaps. 7–10, the implementation of inventory control will become substan-
tially more difﬁcult. First of all the information system must be able to coordinate
data for different items or installations. Normally this means additional costs. Fur-
thermore, the control system will be considerably more complex. Obviously, it is
always necessary to compare the additional costs for a better control system to the
possible advantages of improved inventory control.
When designing an inventory control system it is also important to evaluate po-
tential savings for different types of items. If possible the implementation should be
planned so that large savings are obtained as early as possible.
11.2.2
Selective Inventory Control
In principle each individual item can be controlled in a unique way. But since there
are, in general, several thousands of items, this is not a practical solution. It is much
easier to divide the items into a number of groups and use the same forecasting and
inventory control techniques for all items in the same group. See also Sect. 6.3. We
have already discussed grouping of items in connection with performance evaluation
(Sect. 11.1.2). It is a clear advantage if the same groups can be used both when
selecting control techniques and when evaluating the performance.
A grouping of the items can be done in many different ways and must depend on
the needs of the organization. It should, in general, be affected both by marketing
and production factors.
A type of grouping that is common in many companies is so-called ABC inven-
tory analysis. This means a grouping by dollar volume. Usually a relatively small
percentage of the items accounts for a large share of the total volume. Typically 20 %
of the items can account for about 80 % of the dollar volume. This means, of course,
that the remaining 80 % of the items only account for 20 % of the volume. Items
with a high volume are often more important, and it is therefore reasonable to expect
that such items should require a more precise control and performance evaluation.
Consequently, many companies initially group their items in three classes, A, B,
and C. The A class consists of items with very high dollar volume. Typically the A
class contains 10 % of the items. Likewise about 30 % of the items with intermediate
dollar volumes can be classiﬁed as class B items, and ﬁnally the remaining 60 % of
the items with low dollar volumes are referred to as the C class items.
Especially if the inventory control is expensive, e.g., if the control system contains
manual elements, it is important to concentrate the control efforts on the A items. In
a completely computerized system it does not, in general, require much additional
effort to include more or less all items once the system has been implemented. It is
always very important, however, to monitor the performance of the A items closely.
When dealing with a single installation and independent items, it can sometimes
be reasonable to initially use an ABC classiﬁcation and let the control techniques be
the same for all items in the same class. In general, though, there will successively

emerge needs for dividing these initial groups into smaller subgroups. When using
the more complicated methods in Chaps. 7–10, a grouping of the items must normally
also depend on couplings between items and facilities.
11.2.3
Model and Reality
In this book we have presented different models and corresponding methods which
can be used for forecasting demand and controlling inventories. There are also many
other models available in the inventory literature. Although there are many models to
choose from, it is still nearly always very difﬁcult or impossible to ﬁnd a model that
completely describes a certain real-life situation. Most real settings are indeed very
complicated. Furthermore, in order to be a useful tool, a model should be reasonably
simple. In most situations we are forced to accept that our model is a rather rough
approximation of the real system. When working with inventory control it is very
important to remember this when dealing, for example, with methods for lot sizing
and determination of safety stocks.
The relationship between model and reality is illustrated in Fig. 11.1.
The control methods used are based on an approximate description of the real
system, the inventory model. This means, in other words, that the methods take
some aspects of reality into account but ignore others. The resulting control will not
always be as intended. Quite often it is therefore necessary to adjust cost parameters
and service constraints in order to compensate for the incomplete model description.
To understand how this can be done, and be able to use an inventory control system
efﬁciently, it is very important to understand the underlying basic assumptions of
different models. It is usually very fruitful to think over carefully how these basic
assumptions differ from the real inventory system. For example, what can the con-
sequences be if the real demand distribution differs substantially from that in the
model?
On the other hand, it is not necessary for successful application of a certain control
method to be able to follow the mathematical analysis that is used when deriving the
control method from the inventory model.
Because a model is an approximate description of reality, we cannot just choose
cost parameters (Sect. 3.1) corresponding to what we think are the real cost factors
and hope to get an adequate balance between different types of costs. To obtain

230
11
Implementation
efﬁcient control it is normally necessary to monitor different performance measures
carefully (Sect. 11.1.2) and adjust the control parameters with respect to the actual
outcome.
Assume, for example, that in the performance evaluation we ﬁnd that the capital
tied up in stock is higher that what was expected. If we want to reduce the carrying
costs, there are several possibilities. We can use smaller batch quantities and/or
smaller safety stocks. One way to obtain this is to increase the carrying charge when
determining holding costs. This will reduce the batch quantities and also the safety
stocks if the holding costs are balanced against certain backorder costs. The safety
stocks, however, are not affected in case of given service levels. A lower service level
will, of course, always reduce the safety stocks. Since the model is approximate, the
cost parameters of an inventory model do not need to correspond to real cost factors.
The cost parameters of an inventory model should instead be regarded as control
parameters that can be adjusted to obtain a satisfactory overall control as measured
in the performance evaluation. Parameter adjustments should, however, as we shall
discuss in Sect. 11.2.6, be carried out slowly while continuously monitoring the
outcome.
11.2.4
Step-by-Step Implementation
An inventory control system can be more or less automatic. At least in principle, the
system can generate complete purchasing and production orders without any manual
interaction. It is possible, however, that this is too dangerous because of possible
errors. Especially in the implementation phase and when adjusting the control, it is
rational to be extremely careful.
An implementation as well as adjustments of the control system should be carried
out successively under thorough supervision. Two main rules can be recommended:
•
Introduce changes step-by-step
As we have discussed earlier, the same control techniques are usually used for
a group of items. The economic outcome is also, in general, monitored for each
group separately. When implementing the control system it is recommendable to
take one group at a time and continue the implementation with other groups ﬁrst
when feeling conﬁdent concerning already implemented parts of the system.
•
Use the new and the old system in parallel
In an initial phase it is reasonable to compare a new or revised inventory control
system to the previous decision rules. This makes it easier to discover and correct
various errors and shortcomings of a new system.
An inventory control system should be continuously adjusted to changing operat-
ing conditions. In practice it is not uncommon that the personnel using the system
discover that orders for some items are triggered in a less suitable way. In such a
situation it is far too common that the orders are changed manually without adjust-
ing the system itself. This means, of course, that such changes must be carried out

11.2
Development and Adjustments
231
also in the future, and the beneﬁts of the control system are reduced substantially.
Nearly always in such situations it is possible to adjust cost parameters or make
minor changes in the methodology so that the control system will work adequately.
It is therefore important to document all errors and other problems initially.
11.2.5
Simulation
Sometimes it can be difﬁcult to choose suitable inventory control methods, and also
to ﬁnd appropriate values of the various control parameters that affect system control.
One problem in this context is that it is normally not feasible to evaluate a control
policy by practical application, since such an evaluation would take considerable
time. For example, if the service level is adjusted for a group of items, it can take
several months before the consequences can be clearly observed. If the change turns
out to have mainly negative consequences the experiment can be quite expensive.
One way to evaluate different control methods in advance is to use simulation.
When using simulation we are also, like in Fig. 11.1, replacing the real system by a
mathematical model. Simulation experiments with the model which can be carried
out very quickly are then used for analyzing the system. Using simulation, it is in
general, possible to evaluate the development during several years in a few seconds,
and it is easy to make various test runs with different inventory control techniques.
Technically it is quite easy to simulate an inventory system. It is possible to use
special simulation software, or to develop a model using a standard programming
language. A simulation model is, however, in principle associated with the same
limitationsasallothermathematicalmodelsandcannevergiveacompleteillustration
of the real system. Note especially that if a simulation model is based on the same
assumptions as a certain inventory model which can be evaluated exactly, the results
of the simulation will, of course, be exactly the same and will therefore not give any
additional insight. Simulations can give valuable additional information, though, if
the simulation model illustrates the real system better in some way. Assume, for
example, that the determination of safety stocks in an inventory control system is
based on the assumption of a certain demand distribution, and that it has not been
possible to analyze in detail how well this type of demand corresponds to the real
demand distribution. A simulation model based on real historical demand data can
then be used for analyzing whether the demand distribution used is reasonable.
11.2.6
Short-Run Consequences of Adjustments
Adjustments of the inventory control have consequences both in the short run and
in the long run. The objective when making adjustments is usually to obtain good
control in the long run. Furthermore, it is normally only the long-run steady state

232
11
Implementation
situation that is reﬂected in different inventory models. Quite often, though, it is
important to consider also the short-run, transient behavior of an inventory system.
To illustrate the development in the short run we shall discuss the consequences
when changing reorder points and batch quantities. When increasing the reorder
points, due to, for example, longer lead-times or higher safety stocks, this will result
in a lot of new orders since many items will reach their reorder points directly or
relatively soon. If the increase of the reorder points corresponds to, for example, 1
week’s demand, the additional orders in the short run will also correspond to about
1 week’s demand. The consequences are similar but in the other direction when
reducing the reorder points. When reducing the reorder points the change in the ﬂow
of orders is slower, though, since it cannot be seen until the items successively reach
their original reorder points. (See also Sect. 8.2.5.)An increase of the batch quantities
will, of course, mean larger orders when the items reach their reorder points and will
consequently increase the total ﬂow of orders in the short run. From this discussion
we can formulate two important conclusions:
•
Changes in the inventory control will nearly always ﬁrst result in a higher total
stock. When changing the control, some reorder points are increased while others
are reduced. Because the effects of the increased reorder points can be observed
earlier, the total stock will increase in the short run.
•
In the short run, adjustments of the control can cause major changes in the ﬂow
of orders. This can, for example, result in a production load that is far too high.
It is therefore important to adjust the control continuously and under careful
supervision.
When adjusting the inventory control system it is important to be aware of the short-
run effects and understand that it can take a relatively long time until the system
reaches steady state. It is not uncommon that changes in the inventory control, due to
insufﬁcient understanding of these effects, can create a situation that is completely
opposite of what was intended. An example is when increasing the system lead-times
due to a temporary overload in production. Although it may be correct that the real
lead-times have increased because of the overload, increased system lead-times will
mean higher reorder points and a short-run increase in the triggered orders. This will
obviously just increase the overload.
11.2.7
Education
Successful inventory control requires both knowledge and motivation. The impor-
tance of education cannot be overemphasized. First of all it is, of course, very
important that the inventory control methods implemented are based on adequate
inventory models. It is surprisingly common that inefﬁcient techniques are imple-
mented by people who do not know the inventory control area sufﬁciently well.
However, the need for education concerns not only an initial implementation phase.
Too often an inventory control system deteriorates when a key person leaves the

11.2
Development and Adjustments
233
company and the person taking over does not have adequate training. The inventory
control system will then no longer be adjusted properly to ﬁt a changing operating
environment.
Poor training in connection with inventory control can sometimes emanate from
the misunderstanding that the control system completely replaces manual decisions.
An inventory control system should instead be seen as a tool that can be applied more
or less professionally. How the tool is used is often even more important than the
design of the tool. To gain the advantages of a more advanced tool, the user needs a
better education.
The most important part of the education concerns inventory models. It is neces-
sary to understand the basic assumptions in the models used and how system control
is affected by different parameters. Education programs frequently focus too much
on the information system aspects and do not give sufﬁcient insight concerning the
stock control. Good training is needed not only for being able to adjust system control
but also for obtaining satisfactory motivation. When clearly understanding how the
control system works, it is both challenging and stimulating to work for improved
system control.
When implementing a new system, a broad education program for all involved
personnel is recommended. The persons who have the main responsibility for the
inventory control need continuous training. They should be active in professional
societies, attend conferences, and read journals in the ﬁeld.

a) Applying (7.12) and (7.13) we obtain T1 = 27.037, T2 = 39.528, T3 =
43.759, and the costs C1 = 59.178, C2 = 25.298, C3 = 45.705,. The
sum of these costs C = 130.182 is a lower bound for the total costs.
b) Assume that the independent solution is feasible and that we start produc-
tion of product 3 at times t, t, + 43.759, t, + 2 43.759. . . etc. Assume
that the ﬁrst production of product 2 after time t, starts at time t, + Δ1.
Clearly Δ1 ≥σ3 = 15.003. But the next time the time difference is
Δ2 + T2 −T3 =Δ1 −4.231. The time after that it is Δ3 = Δ2 – 4.231,
etc. After some time we will obtain for some n, 0 < Δn < σ3 which
means that the solution is infeasible.
c) Applying (7.17)–(7.19) we obtain Tmin = 7.292, and ˆT
= 34.462,
i.e.,Topt = ˆT = 34.462. The resulting total costs per unit of time are
C = 133.481.
d) Starting with W = 27.037 we obtain n1 = 1, n2 = n3 = 2. Next we get
the ﬁnal solution W = 23.617 with the same multipliers and the total costs
C = 131.259. The solution is feasible if we produce items 2 and 3 in diffe-
rent basic periods. In basic periods where product 1 and 2 are produced,
the time required is σ1 + σ2 = 6.168 + 9.697 = 15.865 < 23.617. In basic
periods where product 1 and 3 are produced, the time required is σ1+σ3 =
6.168 + 16.115 = 22.283 < 23.617.

Product I and II are produced in each basic period, III in every second
basic period. Feasible schedule. In a basic period with production of all
three products the production time is 2.956 < 4.6.

a) We have e1 = e2 = 1. Since A2/e2 > A1/e1, the constraint Q2 ≥Q1 will
be satisﬁed automatically if we optimize the items separately in the relaxed
problem. We get Q∗
1 = √2A1d/e1 ≈44.72, and Q∗
2 = √2A2d/e2 =
100. A lower bound for the costs is √2A1de1 + √2A2de2 ≈144.72.
Without any lack of generality we can assume that 20

a) Using (10.18) we obtain P(IL0 = 1) = 0.2240,
P(IL0 = 2) = 0.1494,
P(IL0 = 3) = 0.0498. The holding costs are determined from (10.19).
For Poisson demand the ﬁll rate is equivalent to the ready rate, i.e.,
P(IL0 > 0) = 0.2240 + 0.1494 + 0.0498 = 42.3 %.
b) From (10.21) and (10.22) we obtain E(IL−
0 ) = 0.672 and E(W0) =
0.672/3 = 0.224. Consequently, ¯L1 = ¯L2 = 1.224. For retailer 1 we
obtain P(IL1 = 1) = 0.2203, P(IL1 = 2) = 0.3599, P(IL1 = 3) = 0.2941.
The holding costs are 1.822 and the backorder costs 0.463. The ﬁll
rate is 87.4 %. For retailer 2 we get P(IL2 = 1) = 0.1294, P(IL2 = 2) =
0.2114, P(IL2 = 3) = 0.2591, P(IL2 =4) = 0.2117, P(IL2 = 5) = 0.0865.
The holding costs are 2.608 and the backorder costs 0.565. The ﬁll rate is
89.8 %.
