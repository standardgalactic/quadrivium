Preface
This book grew out of the need for our students to better understand how to 
apply and integrate the Design for Six Sigma methodology and its associated 
tools and techniques. Real-world examples and hands-on experience are 
invaluable resources when instructing the use of methods and tools in train-
ing or in a classroom. The instructors may not have access to these resources, 
thus they can teach only theory and basic examples. Another solution is the 
use of case studies. Case studies can help enhance the learning experience 
by allowing the learner a role in a real scenario. The story of the case study 
adds life to a seemingly lifeless group of tools. With this understanding, 
Design for Six Sigma methods taught with the aid of case studies may help 
some novices and even experienced participants better assimilate the tools, 
because they are presented as a whole.
The primary objective of this book is to provide real-world Design for 
Six Sigma projects performed for a wide variety of product and process/
service designs following the Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate 
(IDDOV) process. The purpose is to facilitate Design for Six Sigma instruc-
tion by providing interactive case studies that will enable learners to apply 
the IDDOV phases.
This book would not be possible without the enthusiasm, dedication, and 
energy that our Design for Six Sigma students and team members exhibit. 
Our goal as authors and editors is to provide the learner with an understand-
ing of how others applied Design for Six Sigma and a guide for how they 
might solve their organization’s problems by applying Design for Six Sigma.

Instructional Strategies for Using This Book
Elizabeth Cudney and Sandra Furterer
The purpose of this book is to provide a guide for learners and appliers of 
Design for Six Sigma methodologies and tools. Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) 
is a roadmap for the development of robust products and services. DFSS is 
a data-driven quality strategy for designing products and services. It is an 
integral part of the Six Sigma quality initiative. The goal of DFSS is to avoid 
manufacturing/service process problems using systems engineering tech-
niques. DFSS consists of five interconnected phases: Identify, Define, Design, 
Optimize, Validate (IDDOV). As such, it is a closed-loop system that starts 
and ends with the customer.
This book provides a detailed description of how to apply Design for Six 
Sigma in product and service development. The book discusses the Design 
for Six Sigma roadmap that links several methodologies including organiza-
tional leadership, product development, system integration, critical param-
eter management, voice of the customer, quality function deployment, and 
concept generation, among others.
The book provides several real-world case studies and applications of 
Design for Six Sigma which have shown significant improvement in meeting 
customer requirements following the IDDOV methodology. The case studies 
include a variety of new products and services. These cases can be used by 
both industry professionals and academics to learn how to apply Design for 
Six Sigma. Examples of tools include Quality Function Deployment, Voice of 
the Customer, Pugh Concept Selection, Ideal Function, Failure Modes and 
Effects Analysis, Reliability, Measurement Systems Analysis, Regression 
Analysis, and Capability Studies, among others. The case studies will bene­
fit the reader by showing the tools and how to integrate them for robust

product and service design. The case studies will provide a detailed, step-by-
step approach to Design for Six Sigma.
The book is designed to engage the reader by enabling hands-on expe-
rience with real Design for Six Sigma project cases in a safe environment, 
where experienced Black Belts and Master Black Belts can help mentor the 
students in Design for Six Sigma. Case studies are designed to enable stu-
dents to work through the exercises and to provide sufficient background 
information so that they can apply the tools as if they collected the data 
themselves. The case discussions provide questions to allow students to 
compare their solutions with actual results and decisions realized by similar 
students who are learning and applying Design for Six Sigma. This will help 
prepare them to touch actual data and make decisions when they embark on 
real-world projects.
1.1  Business Process and Lean Six Sigma Project Backgrounds
The Design for Six Sigma case studies consist of product design and service-
oriented processes in various environments. An overview of each project 
is provided for the students so that they understand the background of 
the project, as well as sufficient information regarding the products and 
services that need to be improved so that they can develop a project charter 
and scope the project. Data that were actually collected in the Design for 
Six Sigma projects are provided for application of Design for Six Sigma 
tools and appropriate statistical analysis. Case exercises are provided 
so that the students can solve the Design for Six Sigma projects for each 
phase of the Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) or Define-
Measure-Analyze-Design-Verify (DMADV) problem-solving methodology. 
Each phase provides the solutions the students actually developed that can 
be used as a guide to solve the next phase of the project.
1.2  Design for Six Sigma Case Study Goals
To successfully complete the Design for Six Sigma case studies, participants 
must apply appropriate problem-solving methods and tools from the Design 
for Six Sigma toolkit to understand the problem, identify key customers 
and stakeholders, understand critical to satisfaction (CTS) characteristics, 
develop potential process and product concepts, select superior concepts, 
optimize the process or product, and develop a plan to mitigate risk for the 
new process or product.

Instructional Strategies for Using This Book
1.3  Design for Six Sigma Tools
During the case study, the class will use Design for Six Sigma IDDOV or 
DMADV and project planning and statistical software that are most com-
monly used in real-world projects.
1.4  Learning Design
Each exercise in the case study is designed so that the teams of students 
experience the factors listed below:
•	 Team interaction, definition of team ground rules, brainstorming, 
and consensus building, as well as the stages of team growth
•	 Choice of how to apply Design for Six Sigma tools and problem-
solving methods
•	 Support of their decisions and application of the tools with data
•	 Review of information for relevant and irrelevant information and 
data, and reframing into what is important to solve the problem
•	 With each exercise, development of students’ understanding and 
application of specific tools and problem-solving methods
•	 Development of written and oral communication through customer 
interaction and written reports and presentations, as well as the abil-
ity to present technical information
•	 Application of project management tools to manage activities and 
complete tasks in a timely manner
•	 Experience in solving an unstructured problem in a safe learning 
environment where mentoring is available
The instructor’s role is to facilitate the learning process. It is critical for the 
instructor to act as a coach or mentor to the student teams. It can also be help-
ful to have Six Sigma Black Belts or Master Black Belts experienced in apply-
ing Design for Six Sigma tools and methods assigned to each student team to 
mentor them in the application of Design for Six Sigma projects.
Most Design for Six Sigma programs work on projects in teams. Therefore, 
the instructor can organize the students into teams of four to six students. 
There is a great deal of value in having students work together as a team to 
work on a DFSS project. They can learn how to work more effectively as a 
team, and team members can transfer learning across the team members 
because students grasp the difficult concepts of Design for Six Sigma at 

4
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
different paces. An effective way to organize the teams is to determine the 
students’ experience and balance the team with a group ranging from no 
experience to extensive experience.
1.5  Required Knowledge Levels by Design 
for Six Sigma Projects
The Design for Six Sigma projects included in this book stem from different 
knowledge levels and depth of understanding for applying DFSS tools and 
techniques. There are three different student levels defined as follows:
•	 Beginner—Undergraduate student (usually senior) student with no 
exposure to Design for Six Sigma and little statistical background
•	 Intermediate—Master’s student with some exposure (theoretical knowl-
edge) to Design for Six Sigma tools and some statistical background
•	 Advanced—Master’s or Ph.D. graduate students with theoretical 
learning of Design for Six Sigma tools and some statistical back-
ground, as well as having worked on a Design for Six Sigma or Six 
Sigma project
This book is divided into two parts to illustrate case studies in product and 
service design. Part 1 provides product design cases (Chapters 3 through 11). 
Part 2 provides service/process design case studies (Chapters 12 through 14).

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
2.1  Design for Six Sigma Overview
Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is a methodology that can be used to system-
atically design new products, services, or processes. It embeds the under-
lying management philosophies and principles and the stretch goal of 
the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) meth-
odology. DFSS focuses on designing a product, service, or process right 
the first time so less time needs to be spent downstream in improving the 
product, service, or process. We will discuss Design for Six Sigma and 
the IDDOV (Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate) methodology as 
they relate to product design and service-oriented and transaction-based 
processes.
In Subir Chowdhury’s book, Design for Six Sigma, he believes that Six Sigma 
can only take an organization so far, and that organizations must focus on 
designing good products and processes, so there is less need to improve 
them, which can prevent errors from occurring (Chowdhury, 2002). From 
Deming’s quality and profitability cycle, improved quality of design can lead 
to higher perceived value by the customer, which can contribute to increased 
market share, margins, revenue, and profitability (Deming, 2000). Most orga-
nizations can reach a level of 4.5 sigma through applying Six Sigma projects 
for process improvement. It is approximately at that point when organiza-
tions hit a brick wall with improvements and must turn to Design for Six

Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
Sigma to further improve products and services through design or redesign 
of those products or services.
Unlike Lean Six Sigma, which typically uses the DMAIC problem-solving 
methodology, Design for Six Sigma literature discusses applying many differ-
ent methodologies to design the new products or services, such as DMADV 
(Design-Measure-Analyze-Design-Validate), IDDOV (Identify-Define-­Design-­
Optimize-Validate), IDOV (Identify-Design-Optimize-Validate), DMADOV 
(Design-Measure-Analyze-Design-Optimize-Verify). The authors adapted 
the IDDOV methodology discussed by Chowdhury and developed the 
roadmap for applying Design for Six Sigma using IDDOV to product- and 
service-oriented process design.
The IDDOV process could be used when creating a brand new process that 
has never been done before in your organization or to make a major redesign 
of an existing process. This existing process may be too broken to provide 
guidance for the redesign. The same methodology can be applied to design 
a product as well. The IDDOV process provides a comprehensive set of tools 
and techniques that can be used based on the type of project (i.e., product 
design, redesign).
The benefits of applying Design for Six Sigma and IDDOV compared 
to Six Sigma and DMAIC are that you are not constrained by an existing 
process, and you do not need to collect large amounts of voice of process 
(VOP) data, or spend time baselining a nonexistent or seriously broken 
process.
Figure 2.1 illustrates the steps that are part of each phase of the IDDOV 
methodology. Figure 2.2 maps the tools typically used in each phase of the 
IDDOV methodology.
The following sections provide a roadmap of how to apply IDDOV and the 
main tools that could be applied when designing a service process.

2.2  Identify Phase
The purpose of the Identify phase is to define the business problem or oppor-
tunity, to scope the project by developing a project charter, and to identify the 
stakeholders impacted by the project. The main activities to be performed in 
the Identify phase are as follows:
	
1.	Develop project charter
	
2.	Perform stakeholder analysis
	
3.	Develop project plan
Figure 2.3 shows the main activities mapped to the tools or deliverables most 
typically used during these activities.
2.2.1  Develop Project Charter
The tools applied in the Identify phase of the IDDOV are the same as those 
used in the DMAIC Define phase. The team structure including Black Belt 
and Master Black Belt mentors, project champions and sponsors, process 
owners, and working team members would be utilized in the DFSS IDDOV 
methodology similar to the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology. The project 
charter elements would be similar, except the scope can be somewhat more 
difficult to define because we do not necessarily have an existing process 
or product to use as a scope, or a process that can be documented using a 
SIPOC (Suppliers-Input-Process-Output-Customers) diagram that helps to 
define the process, inputs, and outputs, as well as the stakeholders of the 
process. However, thinking through what the potential process steps would 
be and who would supply inputs and transform these into outputs, and who 
would receive those outputs would still be helpful to conceptually consider.

The project charter can help to identify the elements that help to scope the 
project and to identify the project goals.
A project charter template is provided in Figure 2.4.
The following is a description of the elements of the project charter that 
help to scope and define the business problem:
Project Name: The name of the project. The title of the project should 
describe the process to be designed or the product to be developed 
along with the project goal.
Project Overview: This provides a project background and describes the 
basic assumptions related to your project.
Problem Statement: A clear description of the business problem and moti-
vation/need for the project. What is the challenge or the problem that 
the business is facing? The problem statement should consider the 
process that is impacted or the problem that a new product would 
solve. Define the measurable impact of the problem. The team should 
be specific as to what is happening, when it is occurring, and what the 
impact or consequences are to the business of the existing problem.
Project Name: Name of the Design for Six Sigma Project
Project Overview: Background of the project
Problem Statement: Business problem, describe what, when, impact, 
consequences
Customer/Stakeholders: (Internal/External) Key groups impacted by 
the project
What Is Important to These Customers—Critical to Satisfaction (CTS): 
Critical to satisfaction, the key business drivers
Goal of the Project: Describe the improvement goal of the project
Scope Statement: The scope of the project, what is in the scope and 
what is out of scope
Financial and Other Benefit(s): Estimated benefits to the business, tan-
gible and intangible
Potential Risks: Risks that could impact the success of the project; can 
assess risk by probability of occurrence and potential impact to the 
project
Milestones: Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) phase 
and estimated completion dates
Project Resources: Champion, Black Belt Mentor, Process Owner,

11
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
Customers/Stakeholders: Define the customers, both internal and exter-
nal, and the stakeholders that are being impacted by the problem, 
process, or product.
Critical to Satisfaction: Identify what is important to each customer/
stakeholder group. They can be identified by what is critical to qual-
ity (defects), delivery (time), and cost.
Goal of the Project: What is the quantifiable goal of the project? It may 
be too early in the problem-solving method to identify a clear tar-
get, but at least a placeholder should be identified relating to what 
should be measured and assessed in order to meet the customers’ 
requirements.
Scope Statement: The scope should clearly identify the process or the 
product to be designed and what is included or excluded from 
the scope for the Design for Six Sigma project. The scope can also 
address the organizational boundaries to be included and possibly, 
more importantly, which should be excluded. It can also include a 
temporal scope of the timing of the project and data collection activi-
ties. The deliverable scope includes what specifics should be deliv-
ered from the project, such as the product to be developed or the 
process to be designed.
Projected Financial and Other Benefits: This describes potential savings, 
revenue growth, cost avoidance, cost reduction, cost of poor quality 
(COPQ), as well as less tangible benefits such as impact to morale, 
elimination of waste, and inefficiencies.
Potential Risks: Brainstorm the potential risks that could impact the 
success of the project. Identify the probability that the risk could 
occur on a high, medium, or low scale. Identify the potential 
impact to the project if the risk does occur on a high, medium, 
or low scale. The risk mitigation strategy identifies how the team 
would potentially mitigate the impact of the potential risk if it 
does occur.
Project Resources: Identify the project leader who is in charge of the 
overall project. Identify the division and department of the project 
leader or project team. Identify the process or product owner, the 
person who is ultimately responsible for implementing process or 
product. The project champion is typically at the director (or above) 
level and has the authority to remove barriers to successful project 
implementation. The project sponsor is the executive-level person 
who sponsors the project initiative and is the visible representative 
of the project and the improvements. The Continuous Improvement 
Mentor or the Master Black Belt is the team’s coach who helps men-
tor the team members in application of the tools and the IDDOV 
methodology. Finance is the financial representative who approves 

12
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
the financial benefits or savings established during the project. Team 
members or support resources are those people who are part of the 
project team or who provide support, information, or data to the 
project team.
Milestones: The milestones are the estimated key dates when each 
phase will be completed and when the project improvements will 
be approved.
2.2.2  Perform Stakeholder Analysis
It is critical to clearly identify the customers and stakeholders impacted by 
the project because the quality of the process or product is defined by the 
customers. Quality is measured by first understanding and then exceeding 
the customers’ requirements and expectations. There is a high cost of an 
unhappy customer: 96% of unhappy customers never complain; 90% of those 
who are dissatisfied will not buy again; and each unhappy customer will tell 
his or her story to as many as 14 other people (Pyzdek, 2003).
Customers and stakeholders can be peers, people who report to me, my 
boss, other groups within the organization, suppliers, and external customers. 
Customers can include both internal and external customers of the process. 
Each process does not always interface directly with an external customer of 
the company but will have internal customers. Internal customers are people 
who receive some output from the process, such as information, materials, 
product, or a service step. It is ultimately the boundary of the process that is 
being designed or who will use or purchase the product that determines who 
the customer is.
The stakeholder analysis definition identifies the stakeholder groups, their 
role, and how they are impacted as well as their concerns related to the pro-
cess. There is an additional column in the definition matrix which provides 
a quick view of whether the impact is positive (+), such as reducing varia-
tion, or negative (–), such as resistant to change. Figure 2.5 is an example of a 
stakeholder definition.
The next step in the stakeholder analysis is to understand the stakehold-
ers’ attitudes toward change, as well as potential reasons for resistance. 
Additionally, the team should understand the barriers to change as a result 
of the resistance. Next, the respective activities, plans, and actions should 
be developed that can help the team overcome the resistance and barriers 
to change. A definition of how and when each stakeholder group should 
participate in the change effort should be developed in the Define phase and 
then updated throughout the IDDOV project. Figure 2.6 shows a stakeholder 
commitment analysis. The stakeholder commitment scale can be used to 
summarize where the stakeholders are regarding their acceptance or resis-
tance to change. The team should determine, based on initial interviews and 
prior knowledge of the stakeholder groups, the current level of support or 

13
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
resistance to the project. Strongly supportive indicates that these stakehold-
ers are supportive of advocating for and making change happen. Moderately 
supportive indicates that the stakeholders will help, but not strongly. The 
neutral stakeholders will allow the change and not stand in the way but will 
not go out of their way to advocate for the change. Moderately against stake-
holders do not comply with the change and have some resistance to the proj-
ect. Strongly against stakeholders will not comply with the change and will 
actively and vocally lobby against the change. A strategy to move the stake-
holders from their current state to where the team needs them to be by the 
end of the project should be developed. This change strategy should include 
how the team will communicate with the stakeholders and any activities in 
their action plan to gain support and implement change.
2.2.3  Develop Project Plan
The project planning activities would include developing a detailed work 
breakdown structure (WBS) and project plan with roles, responsibilities, esti-
mated durations, and prerequisite relationships of the activities. A responsi-
bilities matrix identifies who is responsible for what during the project and 
is an important part of the Identify phase to clearly set the expectations of 
the team members. A sample responsibilities matrix is shown in Figure 2.7. 
The ground rules also help to clarify expectations of behavior and how the 
team will operate. A communication plan can help to clearly identify how 
the team will communicate and interact with the stakeholders. A risk plan, 
often part of the project charter, can be used to identify potential risks that 
could impede project progress, as well as identify mitigation and control 
strategies to avoid and control the risks should they occur. A sample proj-
ect plan for the IDDOV methodology is shown in Figure 2.8. Additional 
tasks can be identified within each phase and major activity. Excel® or a

project-planning software such as Microsoft® Project can be used to track 
tasks completed against the project plan. An important part of the project 
planning is to perform a risk analysis to identify potential risks that could 
impact the successful completion of the project. The team can brainstorm 
potential risks to the project. They can also assess the probability that each 
risk would occur on a scale of high, medium, or low occurrence. The impact 
of the risk should also be assessed—that is, if the risk were to occur, what 
level of impact would it have on the successful completion of the project 
(high, medium, or low)? It is also important to develop a risk mitigation 
strategy that identifies, if the risk occurs, how the team will mitigate the 
impact of the risk to reduce or eliminate the impact of the risk. Figure 2.9 
shows a simple risk matrix.
Another tool that is useful while planning and managing the project is an 
item for resolution (IFR) form. This helps the team to document and track 
items that need to be resolved. It enables the team to complete the planned 
agendas in meetings by allowing a place to “park” items that arise that can-
not be resolved in the meeting, due to time constraints, lack of data, or access 
to appropriate decision makers. Figure 2.10 shows an IFR form. It includes a 
description of the item to be resolved. A priority (high, medium, low) should 
be assigned to each item. The status of the item, open (newly opened), closed 
(resolved), hold (on hold—not being actively worked) should be identified.

that the item was opened and resolved, should be completed on the IFR 
form. A description of the resolution should also be included. This helps 
the team keep track of key decisions and ensures that the items are resolved 
to the satisfaction of all team members. The log of IFRs can also be used 
during the lessons learned activity after the project is complete to identify 
where the problems arose and how they were resolved, to incorporate these 
items into the risk mitigation strategies for follow-on projects.
Another helpful tool that can be developed in the Identify phase, but should 
be used throughout the DFSS project, is a communication plan. The commu-
nication plan can be used to identify strategies for how the team will commu-
nicate with all key stakeholders. It can be useful to help overcome resistance 
to change by planning how frequently and in the manner in which the team 
will communicate with the stakeholders. Each key stakeholder or audience of 
a communicated message should be identified. The objectives or message that 
will be communicated is then developed. The media or mechanism of how 
to communicate with the audience is then identified. This can be face-to-face, 
e-mail, Web sites, and so forth. The frequency of the communication is impor-
tant, especially for those more resistant to change having more frequent com-
munication. The last element of the communication plan is to clearly identify 
who is responsible for developing and delivering the communication to the 
audience. The communication plan is shown in Figure 2.11.
2.2.3.1  Team Meeting Management
Some best practices for team meeting management are as follows:
•	 Respect people and their time.
•	 Determine critical/required participants for e-mails, meetings, 
and decisions.

•	 Cancel or schedule meetings ahead of time.
•	 Always create a meeting agenda and send it out in advance of the meet-
ing. The agenda should include required and optional participants.
•	 Recap action items and meeting minutes.
•	 Use voting in e-mails to make easy decisions, or agree upon a meeting 
time.
•	 Track meeting attendance, and resolve habitual lack of attendance.
The planned meeting agenda should include the following:
•	 Date, time, and proposed length of the meeting
•	 Meeting facilitator’s name
•	 Meeting location
•	 Required and optional attendees
•	 Purpose of the meeting
•	 Desired outcomes
•	 Topic with time and proposed outcome for each topic
Some tips that the meeting facilitator can use to keep the meeting pro-
ductive are as follows (Scholtes, Joiner, and Streibel, 2003):
•	 Listen and then restate what you think you heard.
•	 Ask for clarification and examples.
•	 Encourage equal participation and circle the group.
•	 Summarize ideas and discussion.
•	 Corral digressions and get back to the agenda.
•	 Close the discussion.
2.2.4  Summary
The Identify phase is a critical phase of the project. It is important to spend 
ample time in this phase developing the project charter and getting the buy-in 
of the project champion, the team members, and all stakeholders. The time 
spent clearly defining the scope of the project will reap dividends by reducing

issues during the remaining phases of the project. A process or a problem 
poorly defined will require the team to revisit the project charter and defini-
tion activities when the project bogs down or loses focus in subsequent phases.
2.3  Define Phase
The purpose of the Define phase is to understand the voice of the customer, 
what is important to the customer as defined by the CTS (critical to satisfac-
tion) characteristics, and to translate the customer’s requirements into the 
technical elements of the process or product to be designed. The following 
activities can be applied to meet the objectives of the Define phase:
	
1.	Collect voice of the customer (VOC)
	
2.	Identify CTS measures and targets
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements
Figure 2.12 shows the main activities mapped to the tools or deliverables 
most typically used during that step.

process or product requirements. VOC is an expression for listening to the 
external customer and understanding his or her requirements for your prod-
uct or service. Examples of requirements are expectations for responsive-
ness, such as turnaround time on vendor (customer) invoices, or error rates, 
such as employee (customer) expectations of no errors on their paychecks. 
The voice of the customer can be captured through interviewing, surveys, 
focus groups with the customers, complaint cards, warranty information, 
and competitive shopping. Personal interviews are an effective way to gain 
the voice of the customer; however, it can be expensive, and training of inter-
viewers is important to avoid interviewer bias. Also, additional question-
ing may be necessary to eliminate misunderstandings and clarify customer 
requirements. The objectives of the interview should be clearly defined 
before the interviews are held.
A data collection plan (Figure 2.13) could be used to identify the data to 
be collected that would support the assessment of the proposed CTS and to 
validate these CTS from the customers’ perspective.
The data collection plan ensures the following:
•	 Measurement of critical to satisfaction metrics
•	 Identification of the right mechanisms to perform the data collection
•	 Collection and analysis of data
•	 Definition of how and who is responsible to collect the data

The steps for creating a data collection plan are as follows:
	
1.	Define the critical to satisfaction metrics.
	
2.	Develop metrics.
	
3.	Identify data collection mechanism(s).
	
4.	Identify analysis mechanism(s).
	
5.	Develop sampling plans.
	
6.	Develop sampling instructions.
A description of each step in the data collection plan development follows.
2.3.1.1  Define the Critical to Satisfaction Criteria
Critical to satisfaction is a characteristic of a product or service which ful-
fills a critical customer requirement or a customer process requirement. 
CTS characteristics are the basic elements to be used in driving process 
measurement, improvement, and control (George et al., 2005).
2.3.1.2  Develop Metrics
In this step, metrics are identified that help to measure and assess improve-
ment related to the identified CTS. Some rules of thumb for selecting metrics 
are to (Evans and Lindsey, 2002)
•	 Consider the vital few versus the trivial many.
•	 Metrics should focus on the past, the present, and the future.
•	 Metrics should be linked to meet the needs of shareholders, customers, 
and employees.
It is vital to develop an operational definition for each metric, so it is clearly 
understood how the data will be collected by anyone who collects it. The opera-
tional definition should include a clear description of a measurement, includ-
ing the process of collection. Include the purpose and metric measurement. It 
should identify what to measure, how to measure it, and how the consistency of 
the measure will be ensured. A summary of an operational definition follows.
2.3.1.2.1  Operational Definition
Defining the Measure, Definition: A clear, concise description of a mea-
surement and the process by which it is to be collected
Purpose: Provides the meaning of the operational definition, to provide 
a common understanding of how it will be measured
Clear Way to Measure the Process:
Identifies what to measure
Identifies how to measure
Makes sure the measuring is consistent

22
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
2.3.1.3  Identify Data Collection Mechanism(s)
Next you can identify how you will collect the data for the metrics. Some data 
collection mechanisms include customer surveys, observation, work sampling, 
time studies, customer complaint data, e-mails, Web sites, and focus groups.
2.3.1.3.1  Customer Surveys
Interviews, focus groups, surveys, and market research are some of the most 
common ways to collect the VOC. The main difference between DFSS and 
Six Sigma would be that existing customer complaints, warranty informa-
tion, and other data from an existing process or product would not be avail-
able or could not apply to our new process or product that we are designing. 
However, data from similar processes or products may be used in these 
cases. For redesign of processes and products, then historical information 
would be available for a DFSS project.
Customer surveys are a typical way to collect VOC data. The response rate 
on surveys tends to be low, 20% is a “good” response rate. It can also be 
extremely difficult to develop a survey that avoids bias and asks the ques-
tions that are desired. Customer survey collection can be quite expensive. 
The steps to create a customer survey are as follows (Malone, 2005):
	
1.	Conceptualization: Identify the survey objective and develop the 
concept of the survey, and what questions you are trying to answer 
from the survey.
	
2.	Construction: Develop the survey questions. A focus group can be used 
to develop and/or test the questions to see if they are easily understood.
	
3.	Pilot (Trial Survey): Pilot the questions by having a focus group of 
representative people from your population. You would have them 
review the questions, identify any unclear or confusing questions, 
and tell you what they think the questions are asking. You would 
not use the data collected during the pilot in the actual results of the 
surveys.
2.3.1.4  Item Analysis
Item analysis provides a statistical analysis to determine which questions 
answer the same objectives, as a way to reduce the number of questions. It is 
important to minimize the number of questions and the total time required 
to take the survey. Typically, the survey time should be 10 minutes or less to 
help ensure participants complete the entire survey.
2.3.1.4.1  Revision
Revise the survey questions, and roll out the customer survey, or pilot again 
if necessary.

23
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
2.3.1.4.2  Focus Groups
Focus groups are an effective way to collect VOC data. A small representative 
group, typically 7 to 10 people are brought together and asked to respond to 
predetermined questions. The focus group objective should be developed, and 
the questions should support the objective. The participants should be selected 
by a common set of characteristics. The goal of a focus group is to gather a 
common set of themes related to the focus group objective. There is no set 
sample size for focus groups. Multiple focus groups are typically run until no 
additional themes are derived. Advantages of focus groups are the following:
•	 They tend to have good face validity, meaning that the responses are 
in the words of the focus group participants.
•	 Typically more comments are derived than in an interview with one 
person at a time.
•	 The facilitator can probe for additional information and clarification.
•	 Information is obtained relatively inexpensively.
Some of the disadvantages of focus groups are as follows:
•	 The skills of the facilitator dictate the quality of the responses.
•	 They can be difficult to schedule.
•	 It can be difficult to analyze the dialogue due to participant interactions.
Affinity diagrams organize interview, survey, and focus group data after 
collection. The affinity diagram organizes the data into themes or categories. 
The themes can first be generated and then the data can be organized into 
the themes, or the detailed data can be grouped into the themes. An example 
of a simple affinity diagram for ways to study for a Six Sigma Black Belt exam 
is shown in Figure 2.14.

It is important to clearly summarize the CTS so that we can operationally 
define the metrics and then translate these into the process elements that 
form the technical requirements of our new process.
2.3.1.4.3  Benchmarking
Benchmarking is a tool that provides a review of best practices to be poten-
tially applied to enhance the designed processes or improve the design of 
your product. Benchmarking can be powerful in the DFSS arena so that the 
organization looks outside of itself to understand the industry and even best 
practices outside of the industry that can be used as a model for our process 
or product design. Process benchmarking can be performed to understand 
best practice processes. The organization should document the process that 
they will benchmark and then select who they will benchmark. It is not nec-
essary to benchmark a company in the same industry, but to focus on the 
process to be benchmarked and select an organization that is known for hav-
ing world-class or best-practice processes. The next step is to work with the 
organization to collect the data and understand how the data can be used 
to identify ways to enhance your processes. This is similar to Motorola’s 
benchmarking process (Evans and Lindsey, 2002). It is important to be care-
ful when process benchmarking to ensure that you are comparing apples to 
apples, meaning that the organization’s characteristics are similar to your 
own, so that the benchmarked process applies to your process. Competitive 
product benchmarking can be performed if you are designing a product. 
This is assessing how your product concept compares to similar competitive 
products, based on important customer requirements.
2.3.2  Translate VOC into Technical Requirements
2.3.2.1  Quality Function Deployment
Quality function deployment (QFD) and the House of Quality (HOQ) is an 
excellent tool to help to translate customer requirements from the voice of the 
customer into the technical requirements of your product, process, or service. 
The customer requirements would be prioritized by the customers through 
market research techniques. The strength of the relationship between the 
customer requirements and the technical requirements would be identified 
by the process design team. These relationship strengths would be multiplied 
by the CTS priorities to derive a relative weighting of the technical require-
ments. For a product- or system-level HOQ, you should only use the VOC that 
are new needs (features or performance the product has not historically deliv-
ered); unique needs (features or performance that are distinctive or highly 
desired beyond the numerous other less-demanding needs that must be pro-
vided); and difficult-to-fulfill needs (features or performance that are highly 
desired but are quite difficult for your business to develop and will require 
special efforts/investments of resources on your part) (Paryani, Masoudi, and 
Cudney, 2010). A QFD format is shown in Figure 2.15.

25
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
QFD can lead to (Paryani et al., 2010)
•	 Better understanding of customer requirements
•	 Increased customer satisfaction
•	 Reduced time to market and lower development costs
•	 Structured integration of competitive benchmarking into the 
design process
•	 Increased ability to create innovative design solutions
•	 Enhanced capability to identify those specific design aspects that 
have the greatest overall impact on customer satisfaction
•	 Better teamwork in cross-functional design teams
•	 Better documentation of key design solutions
The steps for creating a HOQ are as follows (Evans and Lindsey, 2002):
	
1.	Define the customer requirements or CTS characteristics from the VOC 
data. The customer can provide an importance rating for each CTS.
	
2.	Develop the technical requirements with the organization’s design 
team.
	
3.	Perform a competitive analysis, having the customers rank your 
product, process, or service against each CTS characteristic to each 
of your competitors.
	
4.	Develop the relationship correlation matrix by identifying the 
strength of relationship between each CTS and each technical

requirement. Typically there is a numerical scale of 9 (high strength 
of relationship), 3 (medium strength of relationship), 1 (low strength 
of relationship), and blank (no relationship).
	
5.	Develop the trade-offs or relationships between the technical 
requirements in the roof of the HOQ. You can identify a positive (+) 
relationship between the technical requirements, as one requirement 
increases the other also increases; with no relationship (blank) or a 
negative (–) relationship, there is an inverse relationship between the 
two technical requirements. An example of a positive relationship 
can be illustrated in the design of a fishing pole. The line gauge and 
tensile strength both increase as the other increases. A negative rela-
tionship can be illustrated by line buoyancy and tensile strength. As 
tensile strength of the line increases, the buoyancy will be less.
	
6.	The priorities of the technical requirements can be summarized by 
multiplying the importance weightings of the customer require-
ments by the strength of the relationships in the correlation matrix. 
This helps to identify which of the technical requirements should 
be incorporated into the design of the product, process, or service 
first. We will use the identified technical requirements as the pro-
cess elements for our process or as technical product requirements 
for a product as inputs to the Design phase.
2.3.2.2  Interpreting the House of Quality
The House of Quality is interpreted as follows (Paryani et al., 2010):
•	 Blank columns are unnecessary design requirements.
•	 Blank rows are missed customer requirements.
•	 Rows with no strong relationships are missed customer req­ui­rements.
•	 Identically weighted rows indicate a possible misunderstanding of 
customer requirements.
•	 Strong diagonal patterns indicate that customer requirements probably 
contain design solutions.
•	 Complete or nearly complete row shows that customer requirement 
involves a cost, reliability, or safety problem.
•	 Complete or nearly complete column is a design requirement that 
involves a cost, reliability, or safety problem.
•	 A large number of weak relationships indicate too much fuzzy 
weight, clear decisions will be confounded with noise.
2.3.2.3  Kano Analysis
The Kano model defines three types of quality requirements (Cudney, Elrod, 
and Uppalanchi, 2012):

27
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
•	 One-dimensional quality: The one-dimensional or linear quality is a 
specifically requested item. It is a stated want identified on a cus-
tomer survey. If present, the customer is satisfied. If this character-
istic is absent, the customer is dissatisfied. An example is asking for 
a rare steak.
•	 Expected or basic quality: These elements or customer requirements 
are not specifically requested, but they are assumed by the customer 
to be present. If they are present the customer is neither satisfied nor 
dissatisfied. If they are absent, the customer would be very dissatis-
fied. An example is clean silverware in a restaurant.
•	 Exciting or delightful quality: This level of quality characteristics 
is unknown to the customer. It is not something that they would 
think to ask for. These elements are the most difficult to define and 
develop. If present, the customer is very satisfied. If absent, the cus-
tomer is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. An example is fine linen or 
fresh floral arrangements.
The Kano model also defines how the achievement of these requirements 
affects customer satisfaction. The Kano model is shown in Figure 2.16.
2.4  Design Phase
The purpose of the Design phase is to understand the elements of the pro-
cess or product which can ensure the CTS of the customers and stakeholders 
are met; to design the new process or product; and to identify potential risks,

failures, and inefficiencies that could occur in the new process. Following are 
the main activities to be performed in the Design phase:
	
1.	Identify process elements.
	
2.	Design process.
	
3.	Identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
Figure 2.17 shows the main activities mapped to the tools or deliverables 
most typically used during the Design phase.
2.4.1  Identify Process Elements
The first step in the Design phase is to analyze the VOC data that were 
collected in the Define phase. Attribute survey analysis using chi-square 
statistical analysis would be used to analyze attribute survey data. The 
results and data collected from the VOC would be used to generate the 
elements that would be incorporated into a process or product, or poten-
tial alternate process or product concepts. Potential elements could be cat-
egorized by people, process, and technology. The people aspects would 
be which organizations and roles would be involved in owning and con-
tributing to the process; the cultural and political aspects, resistance to 
change, training and skill sets available, and organizational structure. The 
process elements could pertain to any policies and procedures that may

impact the process, understanding the activities needed to be performed 
as well as how to measure and assess performance. The technology ele-
ments would pertain to what technologies would be needed, such as using 
a SharePoint site, or perhaps an off-the-shelf or internally developed infor-
mation system.
There are many techniques that are part of the DFSS tool kit that can help to 
generate and brainstorm process elements and concepts, such as traditional 
brainstorming and Nominal Group Technique, channel and analogy brain-
storming, antisolution brainstorming and brainwriting, assumption busting, 
and the Theory for Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) (Chowdhury, 2002).
Traditional brainstorming includes sharing ideas in a group and writing 
them on a flip chart or whiteboard. Nominal Group Technique structures 
the brainstorming into first a silent generation then a round-robin idea shar-
ing. Important in any brainstorming activity is to hold the criticism and 
evaluation until after ideas are generated. Channel brainstorming allows a 
group to focus on a subcategory of a task to make the brainstorming more 
manageable. Analogy brainstorming allows participants to focus on a simi-
lar or parallel issue to generate ideas, and then link it back to the original 
issue. Antisolution brainstorming asks the participants to generate ideas of 
how they could make the process even worse, punching holes in your own 
argument. In brainwriting, each participant writes down an idea and then 
passes it to the person next to them who then builds on the idea or concept. 
Assumption busting is when the brainstorming group, instead of asking 
“why?” asks “why not?”
TRIZ (The Theory for Inventive Problem Solving), pronounced “trees,” 
was developed by Genrich Altshuller. He developed the TRIZ principles 
by reviewing approximately 40,000 patent applications and extracting the 
key principles. He developed a set of principles that can be used to cultivate 
inventions to eliminate corporate contradictions and problems while gen-
erating creative solutions. A TRIZ principle encourages the team to look at 
the past, present, and future of the process when designing the process. The 
following steps describe the TRIZ process:
	
1.	Think of the ideal vision, process, or system.
	
2.	Think of ways to improve the process or function.
	
3.	Think of ways to eliminate or reduce undesired functions.
	
4.	Think of ways to segment the process.
	
5.	Think of ways to copy existing ideas or processes.
	
6.	Think of a disposable concept.
There is a great deal of depth and richness in the TRIZ concept, related to a 
tangible product design. Presented here are the elements of TRIZ that could 
apply to designing intangible service processes.

2.4.2  Design Process
The Pugh Concept Selection technique is a technique for evaluating and 
selecting concepts. If you have several different process elements or prod-
uct concepts to choose from, you could use this technique. You would first 
brainstorm potential solutions or concepts and then generate criteria upon 
which to compare the concepts. Then you would select one of the concepts 
as the “candidate” concept. It does not matter which concept you select as 
the candidate concept; however, for a redesign of a process or product you 
could select the current process or product. You then compare each of the 
other (new) concepts to the candidate for each comparison criteria. If the 
new concept is better than the candidate for those criteria, you would place 
a plus sign (+) in the cell where the new concept intersects the criteria. If the 
new concept is worse than the candidate concept for the criteria, a minus 
sign (–) is placed in the cell. If the new concept is the same as the candidate 
on those criteria, a zero (0) or S for same is placed in the cell. Figure 2.18 
shows a Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix. You would select the few con-
cepts with the most pluses and the fewest minuses. You could also attack 
the weaknesses of the few concepts and enhance them with the strengths of 
the surviving alternatives.
After you identify the process or product elements or concepts, the team 
can then design the process or product. A process map is a great tool to com-
municate the steps of the new process. It helps to think through sequencing, 
who does what in the process, as well as the information that is needed to 
perform each step of the process and what output is transformed by each 
process step.
The elements with the pluses can be used to form a hybrid product or pro-
cess that takes the best aspects of each concept and combines them to form

a superior concept. This may result in a shortened list of concepts. The team 
can then use the Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix to further analyze the ele-
ments and select the best concept or further incorporate the best elements.
2.4.3  Identify Potential Risks and Inefficiencies
2.4.3.1  Process Analysis
Process and waste analyses can be performed to identify potential process 
inefficiencies and wasteful activities. The process analysis helps to identify 
which activities you have defined in the process that do not add value, which 
could be further eliminated, combined, or reduced. The waste analysis iden-
tifies activities that do not add value and are wasteful.
To identify inefficient process activities in your newly designed process or 
in the manufacturing processes identified to develop your product, the team 
can perform a process analysis coupled with waste elimination. A process 
analysis consists of the following steps:
	
1.	Document the process using process maps.
	
2.	Identify non-value-added activities and waste.
	
3.	Consider eliminating non-value-added activities and waste.
	
4.	Identify and validate (collect more data if necessary) root causes of 
non-value-added activities and waste.
	
5.	Begin generating improvement opportunities.
Value-added activities are those activities that the customer would pay for 
and that add value for the customer. Non-value-added activities are those 
that the customer would not want to pay for or do not add value for the cus-
tomer. Some are necessary, such as for legal, financial reporting, and docu-
mentation reasons that are known as necessary non-value-added activities 
and may be reduced; however, others are unnecessary and should be reduced 
or eliminated. You can assess the percent of value-added activities as
	
Number of value-added activities
Number of total activities
100%
×
where value-added activities include operations that add value for the cus-
tomer and non-value-added activities include delays, storage of materials, 
movement of materials, and inspections. The number of total activities 
includes the value-added activities and the non-value-added activities.
You can also calculate the percent of value-added time as
	
LSL
USL

32
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Typically, the percent of value-added time is about 1% to 5%, with total non-
value-added time equal to 95% to 99%.
During the process analysis, the team can focus on areas to identify inef-
ficiencies in the following areas:
•	 Can labor-intensive process be reduced, eliminated, or combined?
•	 Can delays be eliminated?
•	 Are all reviews and approvals necessary and value added?
•	 Are decisions necessary?
•	 Why is rework required?
•	 Is all of the documentation, tracking, and reporting necessary?
•	 Are there duplicated processes across the organization?
•	 What is slipping through the cracks causing customer dissatisfaction?
•	 What activities require accessing multiple information systems?
•	 What requires excess travel? Look at the layout requiring the travel.
•	 Is it necessary to store and retrieve all of that information? Do we 
need that many copies?
•	 Are the inspections necessary?
•	 Is the sequence of activities or flow logical?
•	 Are standardization, training, and documentation needed?
•	 Are all of the inputs and outputs of a process necessary?
•	 How are the data and information stored and used?
•	 Are systems slow?
•	 Are systems usable?
•	 Are systems user friendly?
•	 Can you combine tasks?
•	 Is the responsible person at too high or low of a level?
2.4.3.2  Waste Analysis
Waste analysis is a Lean tool that distributes waste into eight different cat-
egories to help brainstorm and eliminate different types of wastes. The eight 
wastes are all considered non-value-added activities and should be reduced 
or eliminated when possible. Waste is defined as anything that adds cost to 
the product without adding value. The eight wastes are
•	 Transportation: Moving people, equipment, materials, and tools
•	 Overproduction: Producing more product or material than is necessary 
to satisfy the customers’ orders or faster than is needed

33
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
•	 Motion: Unnecessary motion, usually at a micro or workplace level
•	 Defects: Any errors in not making the product or delivering the service 
correctly the first time
•	 Delay: Wait or delay for equipment or people
•	 Inventory: Storing product or materials
•	 Processing: Effort that adds no value to a product or service; incor-
porating requirements not requested by the customer
•	 People: Not using people’s skills, and mental, creative, and physical 
abilities
The process metrics that will be embedded in the process should be defined. 
An operational definition includes the purpose of the measure, as well as a 
specific and detailed description of how you would measure the metric.
Some other tools, beyond the scope of this text, could include performing sim-
ulations, prototypes, and design of experiments to help in designing the process.
2.4.3.3  Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
A failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a great tool to help think 
through the potential risks in a process or where the product failures can 
occur. By thinking of potential failure modes for each process step or prod-
uct component, identifying the probability of occurrence, identifying the 
impact or severity to the stakeholders if the failures occur, and having the 
ability to detect the failure, we can develop recommendations to incorpo-
rate into the process or product to either reduce the probability for failure, 
reduce the impact if the failure occurs, and improve the ability to detect the 
failure. The FMEA is a systemized group of activities intended to recognize 
and evaluate the potential failure of a product or process, identify actions 
that could eliminate or reduce the likelihood of the potential failure occur-
ring, and document the entire process.
The FMEA process includes the following steps:
	
1.	Document the process and define functions.
	
2.	Identify potential failure modes.
	
3.	List effects of each failure mode and causes.
	
4.	Quantify effects: severity (SEV), occurrence (OCC), detection (DET).
	
5.	Define controls.
	
6.	Calculate risk and loss.
	
7.	Prioritize failure modes.
	
8.	Take action.
	
9.	Assess results.
A simple FMEA form is shown in Figure 2.19.

The risk priority number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying the severity 
times the occurrence times the detection. The severity is estimated for the 
failure and is given a numerical rating on a scale of 1 (low severity) to 10 
(high severity). Occurrence is given a numerical rating on a scale of 1 (low 
probability of occurrence) to 10 (high probability of occurrence). The detec-
tion scale is reversed, where a numerical rating is given on a scale of 1 (fail-
ure is easily detected) to 10 (failure is difficult to detect).
A Pareto diagram can be created based on the RPN values to identify 
the potential failures with the highest RPN values. Recommendations 
should be developed for the highest-value RPN failures to ensure that 
they are incorporated into the improvement recommendations for the 
process or product.
2.5  Optimize Phase
The purpose of the Optimize phase is to understand the elements of the pro-
cess or product that can ensure the CTS characteristics of the customers and 
stakeholders are met, to pilot the new process or prototype the new product, 
to assess process capabilities, and to identify potential risks, failures, and 
inefficiencies that could occur in the new process. Following are the main 
activities to be performed in the Optimize phase:
	
1.	Implement pilot process.
	
2.	Assess process capabilities.
	
3.	Optimize design.
Figure 2.20 shows the Optimize activities mapped to the tools and deliver-
ables typically used in the Optimize phase.
2.5.1  Implement Pilot Processes
The team should gain the appropriate approvals to pilot the process or develop 
a product prototype from the process owners and stakeholders. A presentation 
of the project to this point may help to communicate the value of the project and 
the new process or product. To implement the process or develop the product 
prototype, the team would develop an implementation plan that would include 
each implementation activity, who would be responsible for implementing 
each step, the stakeholders the activity would impact, and the due date for 
when the activity would be complete. Figure 2.21 shows an implementation 
plan template.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
2.5.1.1  Statistical Process Control Charts
Statistical process control (SPC) is an effective tool to help ensure your pro-
cess performance is being attained. SPC charts are a graphical tool for moni-
toring the activity of an ongoing process. SPC is a methodology that uses the 
basic graphical and statistical tools to analyze, control, and reduce variability 
within a process. It is a powerful tool to optimize the information for use 
in making management decisions. By collecting readily available data from 
samples, variations in the process, the quality of the end product and service 
can be detected and corrected before waste is produced.
The most commonly used control charts are also referred to as Shewhart 
control charts, because Walter A. Shewhart first proposed the general theory 
in the 1920s at AT&T Western Electric. Figure 2.22 identifies the most com-
monly used control charts.
These charts can highlight trends and identify when something goes wrong 
in the process (assignable cause) that would encourage us to investigate the

root cause of the problem. Assignable causes or special cause variations stem 
from factors that cannot be adequately explained by any single distribution 
of the process output. These are shifts in output caused by a specific factor 
such as environmental conditions or process input parameters that affect the 
process output in unpredictable ways. This type of variation can be detected 
by simple statistical techniques.
Common causes are sources of variation that produce chance or natural 
variation. These stem from phenomena constantly active within the system. 
If common causes of variation are present, the output of the process forms 
a distribution that is predictable and stable over time. Eliminating common 
cause variation requires actions on the system.
The process capability would be assessed, by collecting data for the met-
rics previously identified. For service processes, the data do not necessar-
ily follow a normal distribution; therefore, a nonnormal capability analysis 
should be used. If attribute control charts are used to control the process, 
the process capability is the average value or center line of the control chart 
when the process is in control.
The following steps can be used to implement control charts:
	
1.	Determine the type of chart, quality characteristic, sample size and 
frequency, and data collection mechanism.
	
2.	Select the rules for out-of-control conditions.
	
3.	Collect the data (10 to 25 subgroups).
	
4.	Order data based on time order.
	
5.	Calculate the trial control limits, create charts (using a statistical 
program such as Minitab®).
	
6.	Identify out-of-control conditions.
	
7.	Remove points where you can assign causes.
	
8.	Recompute the control limits.
If the process is not meeting the target metrics and expectations of the cus-
tomers and stakeholders, further redesign of the process can be performed. 
Further process and waste analysis would be helpful for the redesign. Also, if

training was not implemented during the pilot process, it should be considered 
first to ensure the new process is being consistently understood and practiced, 
and skill transfer is occurring. Training plans would include the topics to be 
covered, as well as the targeted training audience, the expected length of the 
topic, any expected prerequisite knowledge, and the instructional strategies to 
be applied. Figure 2.23 shows a training template example.
Detailed procedures also help to train stakeholders in the processes to pro-
vide the service or to develop the new product to ensure consistency and 
repeatability of the process. We cannot improve a process if it is not first con-
sistent, stable, and repeatable (i.e., in control). This provides a baseline upon 
which to further optimize and improve the process.
2.5.2  Assess Process Capabilities
To develop the process capability, you can calculate the DPMO (defects per 
million opportunities) and related sigma level, or you can calculate the capa-
bility indices. We will first discuss DPMO.
2.5.2.1  Defects per Million Opportunities (DPMO)
Six Sigma represents a stretch goal of six standard deviations (σ) from 
the process mean to the specification limits when the process is centered, 
but also allows for a 1.5 sigma shift toward either specification limit. This 
represents a quality level of 3.4 defects per million. This is represented in 
Figure 2.24.
The greater the number of σ’s, the smaller is the variation (the tighter the 
distribution) around the average. DPMO provides a single measure to com-
pare performance of very different operations, giving an apples-to-apples 
comparison, not apples to oranges. Figure 2.25 shows a sigma to DPMO con-
version incorporating a 1.5 sigma shift over time.

where defects is the number of defects in the sample; units is the number 
of units in the sample, and opportunities is the number of opportunities 
for error. For example, for a purchase order with a sample of 100 purchase 
orders, finding 5 defects, with 30 fields on the purchase order (opportunities 
for errors), we calculate a DPMO of 1,667 or about 4.4 sigma.
2.5.2.2  Process Capability Study
Process capability is the ability of a process to produce products or provide

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
You should only conduct a process capability study when the process is in 
a state of statistical control. Process capability is based on the performance 
of individual products or services against specifications. According to the 
central limit theorem, the spread or variation of the individual values will be 
greater than the spread of the averages of the values. Average values smooth 
out the highs and lows associated with individuals.
Following are the steps for performing a process capability study:
	
1.	Define the metric or quality characteristic. Perform your process capa-
bility study for the metrics that measure your CTS characteristics.
	
2.	Collect data on the process for the metric, take 25 to 50 samples.
	
3.	Perform graphical analysis (histogram).
	
4.	Perform a test for normality.
	
5.	Determine if the process is in control and stable, using control charts. 
When the process is stable, continue to Step 6.
	
6.	Estimate the process mean and standard deviation.
	
7.	Calculate the capability indices, usually: Cp, Cpk
	
Cp = Upper Specification Limit

A process can be in control but not necessarily meet the specifications 
established by the customer or engineering. You can be in control and 
not capable. You can be out of control or unstable but still meet specifica-
tions. There is no relationship between control limits and specification 
limits. Control limits are calculated based on the voice of the process (i.e., 
process data). Specification limits are based on the voice of the customer. 
Your process must be in control before you use the estimates of standard 
deviation from your process to calculate process capability and your 
capability indices.
There are typically three scenarios regarding process capability:
	
1.	Process spread is less than the specification spread and within speci-
fication limits. The process is quite capable. Figure 2.26 shows this 
scenario. Cp and Cpk are greater than 1.33.

41
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
	
2.	Process spread is equal to specification spread and within specifica-
tion limits, an acceptable situation, but there is no room for error. If 
the mean shifts, or variation increases, there will be nonconforming 
product. Figure 2.27 shows this scenario. Cp = Cpk = 1.
	
3.	Process spread is greater than the specification spread. The process 
is not capable. Figure 2.28 shows this scenario. Cp and Cpk are less 
than 1.
2.5.3  Optimize Design
To optimize design several tools can be used. Process mapping, process 
analysis, and waste analysis can be further applied to optimize the newly 
designed processes and the manufacturing processes that create your new 
product. A cost/benefit analysis may be necessary to cost justify prod-
uct or process implementation decisions, especially if new technology or 
new information systems are required. Statistical process control can be 
used along with process capability studies to ensure that the processes 
are stable and that assignable causes are captured and eliminated when 
discovered.

2.5.3.1  Mistake Proofing
Mistake proofing is a tool that helps to prevent errors in your process. Errors 
are inadvertent, unintentional, accidental mistakes made by people because 
of the human sensitivity designed into our products and processes.
Mistake proofing, also called Poka Yoke, is the activity of awareness, detec-
tion, and prevention of errors that adversely affect our customers and our 
people and result in waste.
Some of the underlying mistake-proofing concepts are
•	 You should have to think to do it wrong, instead of right.
•	 Easy to perform inspection should be done at the source.
•	 An immediate response should be given when a defect occurs.
•	 It reduces the need for rework and prevents further work (and cost) 
on a process step that is already defective.
•	 Simplifies prevention and repair of defects by placing responsibility 
on the responsible worker.
2.5.3.2  Design of Experiments
Design of experiments includes a vast array of statistically designed experi-
ments that can be used to identify the factors that impact the quality of the 
product or processes. Sequential experimentation can be used to first screen 
potential factors that impact product or process design, and then run more 
refined studies to identify the levels across the identified critical factors. The 
following experiments can be applied to help optimize the product or pro-
cess design:
•	 Screening experiments define basic, linear, main effects between a 
Y variable and any number of x values. This approach looks at the 
effects of independent x variables.
p
Process Spread = 6σ
FIGURE 2.28
Process is not capable.

43
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
•	 Main effects and interaction identification experiments define how 
strong the main effects and the interactions between certain main 
effects (xs) are on the Y variables.
•	 Nonlinear effects experiments use a variety of experimental data 
gathering and analysis structures to identify and quantify the 
strength of nonlinear effects of certain x variables (second-order 
effects and beyond as necessary).
•	 Response surface experiments study relatively small numbers of xs 
for their optimum set points (including the effects due to interac-
tions and nonlinearities) for placing a Y or multiple Ys onto a specific 
target. They can also be used to optimally reduce variability of a 
critical functional response in the presence of noise factors but only 
on a limited number of x parameters and noise factors.
2.6  Validate Phase
The purpose of the Validate phase is to validate the process, assess the per-
formance, failure modes, and risks, and iterate through a revised process 
until you are ready to finalize and stabilize the new process. The main activi-
ties performed in the Validate phase are
	
1.	Validate process or product.
	
2.	Assess performance, failure modes, and risks.
	
3.	Iterate design and finalize.
The activities and related tools and deliverables of each activity are shown in 
Figure 2.29 for the Validate phase.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
2.6.1  Validate Process or Product
The first activity in the Validate phase is to validate that the process or prod-
uct is meeting the CTS metric targets. Developing a dashboard or scorecard 
to display the key metrics to management is helpful to ensure the process is 
performing to expectations and specifications.
The process should be piloted for some time to assess the performance of 
the process, or the product should be prototyped and tested. The appropriate 
statistical or analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests can be performed to assess 
the performance.
2.6.2  Assess Performance, Failure Modes, and Risks
2.6.2.1  Hypothesis Testing
The purpose of hypothesis testing is to
•	 Determine whether claims on process parameters are valid.
•	 Understand the variables of interest, the CTS characteristics.
The hypothesis test begins with some theory, claim, or assertion about a 
particular characteristic (CTS) of one or more populations or levels of the x 
(independent variable).
The null hypothesis is designated as H0 (pronounced “H-O”), and defined as 
there is no difference between a parameter and a specific value. The alternative 
hypothesis (H1) is designated as there is a difference between a parameter and 
a specific value. The null hypothesis is assumed to be true, unless proven other-
wise. If you fail to reject the null hypothesis, it is not proof that the null is true.
In hypothesis testing there are two types of errors. Type I error, or alpha 
(α) risk, is the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when you should not. The 
probability of a Type I error is referred to as alpha. Type II error or beta (β) 
risk is the risk of not rejecting the null hypothesis when you should. The 
probability of a Type II error is referred to as beta.
When performing a hypothesis test, you select a level of significance. The 
level of significance is the probability of committing a Type I error, or alpha, 
and is typically a value of 0.05 or 0.01. Figure 2.30 shows the Type I and Type 
II errors.
The steps for performing a hypothesis test are
	
1.	Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.
	
2.	Choose the level of significance, alpha, and the sample size, n.
	
3.	Determine the test statistic.
	
4.	Collect the data and compute the sample value of the test statistic.
	
5.	Run the hypothesis test in Minitab or a statistical package.

45
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
	
6.	Make the decision. If the p-value is less than our significance level, 
alpha, reject the null hypothesis; if not, then there are no data to sup-
port rejecting the null hypothesis. Remember, if p is low, H0 must go!
Some of the most common hypothesis tests are summarized in Figure 2.31.
2.6.2.2  ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Analysis of variance is another hypothesis test, when you are testing more than 
two variables of populations. Following are the steps for running ANOVA:
	
1.	Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.
	
2.	Choose the level of significance, alpha, and the sample size, n.
	
3.	Collect data.
	
4.	Check for normality of data, using a test for normality.

5.	Check for equal variances, using an F-test.
	
6.	Run the ANOVA in Minitab or another statistical package.
	
7.	Make the decision.
Common types of ANOVA are as follows:
•	 One-way ANOVA: Testing one variable at different levels, such as 
testing average grade point average for high school students for dif-
ferent ethnicities
•	 Two-way ANOVA: Testing two variables at different levels, such as 
testing the average grade point average for high school students for 
different ethnicities and by grade level
2.6.2.3  Customer Survey Analysis
Most surveys are attribute or qualitative data, where you are asking the 
respondent to answer questions using some type of Likert scale, asking 
importance, the level of agreement, or perhaps, level of excellence.
Ways to analyze survey data:
	
1.	Summarize percent or frequency of responses in each rating cate-
gory using tables, histograms, or Pareto charts.
	
2.	Perform attribute hypothesis testing using chi-square analysis.
Unlike hypothesis testing with variable data, statistically with attribute data 
we are testing for dependence, not a difference, but you can think “makes 
a difference.”
We formulate our hypotheses as
•	 Ho: “{factor A} is independent of {factor B}”
•	 Ha: “{factor A} is dependent on {factor B}”
In addition to the p value, we use contingency tables to help understand 
where the dependencies (differences) exist.
The customer survey analysis steps include
	
1.	State the practical problem.
	
2.	Formulate the hypotheses.
	
3.	Enter your data in Minitab or other statistical package.
	
4.	Run the chi-square test.
	
5.	Translate the statistical conclusion into practical terms.

47
Design for Six Sigma Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV)
If p, the significance level, is low then reject Ho (if p is low, Ho must go). If 
you fail to reject the null hypothesis, Ho, that means that you fail to reject the 
hypothesis that the values are independent. If you reject Ho that means that 
they are dependent, or dependencies or differences exist.
If the process or product is not meeting expectations, further mistake proof-
ing can be applied to reduce errors and to maintain consistency. Mistake 
proofing focuses on raising awareness, vigilance, and the ability to prevent 
errors from occurring.
When using the statistical tests, care must be taken to check if the data 
follow a normal distribution, and if they do not, to use the appropriate non-
normal statistical test.
2.6.3  Iterate Design and Finalize
Replication opportunities also should be assessed to determine if the same 
process or similar concepts can be applied to other products or processes 
elsewhere in the organization. Future plans for further improving the pro-
cess or designing new products should also be developed.
2.7  Chapter Summary
This chapter provided a Design for Six Sigma roadmap, describing the activi-
ties and some of the tools that can be applied in the IDDOV methodology to 
develop a new product or design a new process.

3.1  Project Overview
Current medical walkers present some features and mechanisms that 
demand repetitive force and motions from the user. This situation can cause 
discomfort and pain in the joint articulations to those who need to use 
mobility aids.
An ergonomic study undertaken by Hansen and Kennedy (1984) suggests 
that posture, force, and repetition are the main factors that influence the 
human body and it further is a cause of a phenomenon called cumulative 
trauma disorders (CTDs). In addition, the study of Leung and Yeh (2007) 
confirmed that CTDs are closely related to the weight of the walker and the 
holding gesture, hence a main cause of complaints about pain in the wrists, 
shoulders, back, and waist of those using walkers. These facts demonstrate 
the imperative need to design an ergonomic walker, which is the main objec-
tive of this project.
This project makes use of the best practices and tools from the Design for 
Six Sigma methodology. The gathering of needs from customers, as well as 
principal concerns in the use of this mobility aid were collected through a 
survey conducted of a representative group of 15 elderly people in Rolla, 
Missouri. Furthermore, the identification of technical requirements was 
analyzed through the quality function deployment (QFD) matrix. A poste-
rior selection study was performed to define concepts through the use of 
the Pugh Concept Selection matrix. After obtaining the superior concept, a 
design failure mode and effects analysis (DFMEA) was performed to ana-
lyze potential failure modes presented in the design.
The project goal was to redesign walkers for elderly individuals by 
improving features identified by the user’s survey, including weight, stability, 
multifunctional use, carrying function, and identification function.
A benchmark study of the current walkers was required to understand the 
advantages and disadvantages. The redesign of the walker was expected to 
combine the positive features and minimize the negative features of current 
walkers available in the market.
The project was limited to the redesign of a walker according to the needs 
expressed in the survey of a representative group of 15 elderly people in

3.2.2  Identify
3.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Redesign of walker
Project Overview: The purpose of this project is to redesign a more 
ergonomic walker for climbing slopes and going up and down 
stairs. The new design seeks as well to improve the grip support, 
the adjustment of height and width, and the fold-up mechanism 
that will be foreseen according to user specifications.
Problem Statement: Current walkers in the market present some features 
and mechanisms that demand force and repetitive motions from the 
user. This can cause discomfort and pain in the joint articulations. 
Hence, the project is aimed at developing an alternative design 
that is more ergonomic by taking into account posture, force, and 
repetitive motions from users.
Customer/Stakeholders: The new design is intended to be useful for 
people who have problems of mobility, need a walking support, 
and/or are undergoing rehabilitation.
Goal of the Project: The goal of the project is to redesign a walker that 
can suit the mobility and safety needs of the customers and at the 

54
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
same time have a more ergonomic and comfortable design. The 
project also must take into account the material, resistance, and cost 
of the new walker. In addition, it is intended to reduce the likeli-
hood of accidents due to the design that may cause falls when using 
the walkers.
Scope Statement: The project is limited to the redesign of a walker accord-
ing to customer specifications. The construction or manufacturing 
of the walker will not be included in the scope; however, the devel-
opment of a walker prototype for the new design will be conducted.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): The more comfortable walkers available 
in the market are usually very expensive for seniors who usually 
depend on a spare pension amount or a limited income. The project 
team seeks to develop a new walker that can be more affordable yet 
ergonomic at the same time.
3.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a back-up resource to complete tasks when not available.
3.2.2.3  Project Plan
The design roadmap was created in phases by choosing the best practices and 
tools from Design for Six Sigma to achieve the redesign of the medical walker 
and accomplish a prototype by the end of the project. Though the project 
only covers the redesign and prototype, the validate phase was incorporated 
into the study to guarantee customer satisfaction (a verification survey) and a 
guide was formulated to achieve system capability (balanced scorecard).
The project plan was created by the team. The project was divided into 
phases and activities by using a Gantt chart. The tasks were divided among 
the team members, and a planning schedule was made for the completion of 
the different phases of the project over the weeks as shown in Figure 3.1.

3.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for 
your project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?
3.3  Define Phase
3.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect voice of the customer (VOC): Create a VOC survey to under-
stand the current and potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
3.3.2  Define
In this first phase, the voice of the customer (VOC) was collected through 
a survey conducted of a representative group of 15 elderly people living in 
nursing homes, assisted living houses, and private houses. The survey was 
divided into four parts consisting of nine demographic questions, eight walker 
design questions, three feedback questions, and three ergonomic-related 
questions. Most of the questions were prepared in a multiple choice format. 
There were also open questions to be filled out. The demographic data of the 

57
Design of a Walker—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
overall group are as follows: age range: 64 to 92 years old (mean 81.7 years 
old), 11 females/4 males, 115 to 260 lbs (mean 187.5 lbs), 8 people own rolla-
tors, 7 people own walkers, the duration of using a walker varies between 
3 weeks to more than 10 years. The usage of a walker is “very seldom” to 
“always used.” In addition, nine people still may need to use a cane as well 
as their walker.
Checklist: Market segment analysis was performed by visiting local 
medical stores and online Web sites and performing a market trend 
forecast to address the question, “Is there something like this out 
on the market yet?” In addition, benchmarking, gathering voice of 
the customer through survey, quality function deployment, and 
Kano diagrams were utilized to ensure the team was heading in 
the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information on the voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing a Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
3.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
In order to identify the needs of the customer, the team created a survey 
designed to help us understand the most important factors to a walker. The 
survey included 17 questions as shown below.
We are conducting a project to redesign a more ergonomic and afford-
able medical walker for people with mobility problems and in rehabili-
tation. The information provided will be used to identify satisfaction 
of customers with current walkers, problems in the design that can be 
improved, and helpful features that should be incorporated. The team

3.3.2.2  Quality Function Deployment
Using the voice of the customer we built the House of Quality. These are the 
steps we used to build it:
Step 1: List customer requirements.
Step 2: List technical descriptors (characteristics that will affect more than 
one of the customer requirements, in development or production).
Step 3: Compare the two (customer requirements to technical descriptors) 
and determine relationships.
Step 4: Develop the positive and negative interrelated attributes and 
identify “trade-offs.”

60
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Customer needs are analyzed through the use of QFD to identify func-
tional requirements and translate them into technical requirements for the 
design. A snapshot of the House of Quality can be seen in Figure 3.2.
3.3.2.3  Product Design Metrics and Kano Analysis
The next step was to develop the characteristics into metrics to identify the 
ideal specifications to meet customer requirements. For the design require-
ments, the team used the Kano analysis as shown in Figure 3.3.
3.3.3  Define Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How did your team perform the VOC collection? How could VOC 
collection be improved?
	
2.	Did your team create and distribute a customer survey, and if so, 
what is the appropriate statistical analysis to perform to identify the 
importance of the customers’ requirements?
	
3.	Did you perform a QFD? How did you identify the technical 
requirements, and the correlations between customer and technical 
requirements?
	
4.	What is the value of using the Kano model in your VOC analysis?
3.4  Design Phase
3.4.1  Design Phase Activities
	
1.	 Identify process elements.
	
2.	 Design process.
	
3.	 Identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
3.4.2  Design
The Design stage of the project assures the subsystem concept and design 
development of the walker. First, the team conducted subsystem benchmark-
ing in order to develop important and critical functions that align with cus-
tomer requirements.

Design of a Walker—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
•	 Seat: Cloth seats could make the customers feel unsafe. The design 
of the walker should include two firm padded seat cushions in order 
to divide the two parts for easier folding which would eliminate 
customer complaints regarding an unsafe feeling with cloth seats.
•	 Collapsing mechanism: The user should be able to collapse the walker 
without excessive force and without having difficulty. A simple strap 
will provide a lightweight and robust design.
•	 Horizontal support bar: A plain scissor jack mechanism will provide 
safe and constant separation distance.
•	 Front wheel assembly: The wheels should be large wheels with a full 
swivel feature and high-profile pneumatic tires.
•	 Rear wheel assembly: The wheels should be large wheels with a nons-
wivel feature and high-profile pneumatic tires.
•	 Brake system assembly: Metal contact pads for pneumatic tires with 
a trailing edge feature to provide quick stop in reverse motion and 
smooth stop in forward motion. The brakes should have a locking 
mechanism, for example, while the user is using the seat.
•	 Frame: Tubular aluminum similar to a bike frame created from a 
basic truss.
3.4.2.2  Concept Generation
The goal of our project was to redesign a walker to meet customer require-
ments best. Keeping this in mind, the team brainstormed a few design con-
cepts that might function better than the current walkers. All the design 
concepts were generated by dividing the whole system into nine subsys-
tems as defined in the previous section. The team used the Pugh Concept 
Selection matrix to analyze candidate design concepts based on the VOC 
requirements to get a superior concept for the design.
3.4.2.3  Development of Functions
The subsystem benchmarking analysis allows identification of critical 
requirements to achieve customer requirements. The functions were created 
after a long brainstorming exercise by the team taking into account critical-
ity and independence from the current concepts available in the market as 
shown in Figure 3.4.
3.4.2.4  Design Concepts
Concept A: This will be four-wheeled with a fabric seat (for convenient 
folding) and locking handbrakes for any use (indoors and outdoors). 
Details: The handgrip features will be compliant, ergonomic grips,

with a durable hard inner core. The handlebar is swept back toward 
the user, with each grip ending 30° from parallel to each other. The 
back support has a soft flexible strap to support the user’s back while 
sitting. The seat will be made out of plastic that can be folded, while 
collapsing the folder. The collapsing mechanism will be easy for the 
user to collapse. A simple strap on the seat will enable the walker to 
collapse. The design will include 4-inch swivel-wheels with high-
profile pneumatic tires for the front assembly and 4-inch nonswivel 
wheels with high-profile pneumatic tires for the rear assembly. 
Metal contact pads are for pneumatic tires with a trailing edge fea-
ture to provide quick stops in reverse motion and smooth stops in 
forward motion. The brakes should have a locking mechanism, for 
example, while the user is using the seat. A tubular aluminum frame 
is used. A mesh pouch will be placed in front of the seat. Concept A 
is shown in Figure 3.5.

have a mesh pouch on each side of the walker, which will be folded 
during collapsing. The walker is inspired by an umbrella stroller. 
Concept G is shown in Figure 3.11.
3.4.2.5  Pugh’s Concept Selection
Through our product development the team created seven different designs 
of the walker. To determine the concept that had the greatest potential for 
success, the team utilized the Pugh Concept Selection matrix to assist in nar-
rowing the scope to a single design as shown in Figure 3.12.
The initial best-in-class benchmarked datum concept was selected based on 
the preference of the surveyed participants for four-wheeled walkers or rolla-
tors with brakes and seats. Eight participants owned a rollator and expressed 
satisfaction, comfort, and practical and easy use. In addition to the benchmark 
study of walkers in the market, the four-wheeled or rollator was also confirmed 
to be the best mobility aid among walkers; hence, it was chosen as the datum.
Concept B was selected as the best among other designs because it 
exceeded the features of the best-in-class rollator. From the sum of (+) and 
(–), the design team was able to identify weaknesses in low-scoring concepts 
that can be turned into (+) such as the ability to move in different grounds 
and through narrow aisles, and it definitely requires wheels, seat, and extra 
support. The team also identified weaknesses in high-scoring concepts that 
FIGURE 3.11
Concept G.

72
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
can be turned into (+), such as improving the weight of the walker and incor-
porating a comfortable seat.
After this analysis, a hybrid super concept was created by choosing most 
of the features of Concept B with additional strength features from other 
concepts. According to the design of Concept B, some features are more 
likely to fit, improve, and balance a realistic integration with such a concept. 
This is the reason that the design team chose Concept B as the super concept 
with the following extra features to eliminate the weaknesses in weight and 
seat: aluminum material with limited bars and joint assembly in the frame 
and comfortable seat.
3.4.2.6  Detailed Model of the Product Design
Once the components were identified, the team developed a detailed model 
for the required design specifications as shown in Figure 3.13.

3.5.2  Optimize
In this phase, the team reviewed the selected superior concept to identify 
possible flaws and their effects and probable solutions on how to reduce 
them. The team also compared the influence of one factor on another and 
outside noise factors.
Checklist: Design of experiments, failure mode effect analysis, analy-
sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical 
parameter management
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors from both customers 
and competitors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors that influence each other
•	 Determining probable solutions to failure
3.5.2.1  Design Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
The design failure mode and effects analysis (DFMEA) was performed in order 
to quantify the reliability of the main components/parts of the walker. The 
DFMEA scores for severity, occurrence, and detection categories were applied 
for the scale 1 to 5, which counts 1 as good and 5 as very bad. The severity 
scores that are greater than three are taken as critical because the severity of 
a failure can potentially harm the user. The DFMEA is shown in Figure 3.14.
All high-priority issues identified in the DFMEA are those failure modes 
that have a severity rating equal or greater than four. Figure 3.15 contains 
a detailed plan to reduce the risk priority number (RPN) values and make 
the walker design more insensitive to noise without removing the sources 
of variation.
The priority identification and highest RPN values allow for identifica-
tion of the critical subsystems of the walker design. First, in the particular 
design that the team is designing, the frame and collapsing mechanism are 
the main subsystems bearing most of the weight load due to sitting and

walking support. These two subsystem designs are critical also for other 
subsystems that depend on them as main structures of support such as the 
hard seat and back support. If the frame and horizontal support bar present 
a failure, the whole structure may collapse with the subsequent danger of 
harming the user.
Another critical mechanism is the brake system. It is highly important to 
verify the design through testing the product for reliability and robustness 
in order to guarantee safe use of a front-swivel-wheel walker. The functional-
ity of the brake assembly should be tested in different types of grounds and 
slopes; the design must consider using the walker in handicapped ramps. In 
addition, it is critical to test the pressure and reaction time that the walker

requires to slow down or stop. These functions must align with the force 
applied by users.
The two remaining critical subsystems are the seat and back support. 
These subsystems depend mainly on the stability and structure support of 
the frame and folding mechanism. However, the seat and back support need 
special height, position, and inclination angle to assure these subsystems 
align with the overall stability of the frame and folding mechanism.
3.5.3  Optimize Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How did you define a failure?
	
2.	How did you determine which factors were significant to your design?
	
3.	How did you determine the design solutions to prevent defects?
3.6  Validate Phase
3.6.1  Validate Phase Activities
	
1.	Validate process.
	
2.	Assess performance, failure modes, and risks.
	
3.	Iterate design and finalize.
3.6.2  Validate Phase
In this phase, the team verified the final design parameters with responses 
from customers by providing them with a prototype.
Checklist: Measurement system analysis, manufacturing process capa-
bility study, reliability assessment, worst-case analysis, analytical 
tolerance design
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Prototype approved by customer
•	 Meets large portion of customer needs
•	 Ease to manufacture and cost estimate
•	 Reliability performance
3.6.2.1  Construction of Pilot Prototype
A pilot prototype was created to demonstrate the main subsystems and 
components of the walker design. The creation of the prototype is helpful 

78
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
to identify components that could be combined to integrate functions, 
separated to improve functions, or improved in the design to facilitate the 
production of parts.
3.6.2.2  Materials Used for the Prototype
•	 The design team used two polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes of 1′ and 
5′ diameter to create the frame.
•	 The grip support was created using knee pads.

Design of a Walker—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
•	 The collapsing mechanism consisted of a plastic hose of a smaller 1′ 
diameter, which was inserted into a three-part bar in order to depict 
the latch to lock the walker when folding.
•	 The wheels were assembled to the PVC pipes. Note that though the 
prototype contains four swivel wheels due to trouble finding nons-
wivel wheels, the actual design considers the two rear wheels to be 
nonswivel for better control of the walker.
•	 The lights were actual light reflectors on each side of the frame.
Figure 3.16 shows the pilot prototype.
A survey for verification was created to validate customer requirements 
with the new walker design. A sample population of five users participated 
in the survey whose age ranged between 64 and 73 years old (mean was 
67.6, standard deviation was 3.78). The questions in the survey were limited 
to six questions regarding what features of the new walker design people 
like and dislike most. The results showed that participants found more of 
the following characteristics appealing: the built-in light features (lighting 
system) and the size of the walker after collapsing which makes it more 
convenient for transport. However, the main concerns that participants 
have expressed in the new design are the flexible back strap and pouch fea-
tures. According to the surveyed customers, the flexible back strap could 
be unsafe and offer lack of support. One of the answers expressed by one 
participant: “I wouldn’t lie back on a flexible strap. I want a firm rest sup-
port, not something that will make me nervous of a fall or uncomfortable 
altogether.” In addition, one of the answers expressed about the pouch in 
front of the walkers: “I probably wouldn’t see much if you place a pouch in 
front of the walker. How am I going to be sure of what is ahead of me if the 
pouch will block my vision?”
The main concerns have been addressed by the design team through a 
brainstorming session to generate alternative ideas in the design reaching 
the following changes in the design:
•	 Flexible strap
•	 Replace it by hard back support
•	 Pouch
•	 Relocate smaller pouches in the sides of the walker
•	 Relocate pouch under the seat
3.6.3  Validate Phase Case Discussion

2.	How did you identify potential risks of your product?
	
3.	How would you assess the potential market for your product?

3.7  Summary
The use of DFSS tools allowed the team to understand and interpret customer 
needs, as well as to translate those needs into technical design requirements. 
The breakdown of systems into subsystems facilitated the identification and 
design on individual units. Concept generation allowed the team to integrate 
better features in the walker or rollator. The Pugh Concept Selection matrix 
was useful in the selection of the superior concept. DFMEA allowed the team 
to address possible design failures in the superior concept. The verification 
survey helped the team identify parts of the design that were not satisfied 
by the customer and replace these with alternative designs. The goal of rede-
signing a walker or rollator based on features stated by the 15 participants in 
the questionnaire was achieved.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
4.1  Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to redesign the existing Modular Lightweight 
Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) or Pouch Attachment Ladder System 
(PALS) for a military tool kit holder. The intent was to develop a quick-release 
system that could be used with the current MOLLE system.
The original military tool kit holder system does not allow for a quick 
attachment or detachment, it is a semipermanent attachment system. The tool 
holder has web straps (PALS) that can be attached to most MOLLE systems. 
This current system is not practical due to its constraints on the individual’s 
movements and the individual’s safety; it also negatively impacts the morale 
of the carrier. The original system does not meet the needs of the modern 
soldier or law enforcement officer working in a dynamic environment.
The project was limited to the military tool kit holder. The design team 
developed multiple new designs in order to provide a recommendation for 
an improved military tool kit holder attachment system. The parameters 
were limited to the method of attachment between the military tool kit 
holder and the current Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) or other PALS equipment. 
A new design will be developed that meets the individual’s requirements of 
safety, efficiency, speed, and ease of use.
The team utilized the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) process to design attach-
ment concepts for the military tool kit holder. The target was to use quick-
release detachable joints that are specifically focused on the tactical service 
member, which enables that person to perform his or her mission. The usage 
of this innovative technology will allow service members to accomplish 
their mission effectively and safely. By analyzing several different attach-
ments, the team compared the practicality, durability, and functionality of 
the designs to present an optimal solution for the design. The team made 
incremental improvements and developed a final design of the optimal solu-
tion that addresses all of the customer functionality needs.

4.2.2  Identify
4.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Quick-Release Military Tool Kit Holder
Project Overview: The purpose of this project is to redesign the existing 
MOLLE attachment system for the military tool kit holder.
Problem Statement: The original military tool kit holder system does 
not allow for a quick attachment or detachment; it is a semiper-
manent attachment system. The tool holder has web straps that 
can be attached to any MOLLE system. This current system is not 
practical due to its constraints on the individual’s movements and 
the individual’s safety, and it negatively impacts the morale of 
the carrier. The original system does not meet the needs of the 
modern soldier or law enforcement officer working in a dynamic 
environment.
Customer/Stakeholders: Military and law enforcement personnel
Goal of the Project: A new design will be developed that meets the indi-
vidual’s requirements of safety, efficiency, speed, and ease of use.
Scope Statement: The project is limited to the military tool kit holder. 
The Design for Six Sigma team will redesign and recommend an 
improved military tool kit holder. The parameters will be limited to 
the method of attachment.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Increase demand for the military tool kit 
holder.

4.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.
4.2.2.3  Project Plan
The project was set into the DFSS phases of Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-
Validate (IDDOV). Specific requirements were identified for this project and 
are represented in their respective phase of the DFSS project. The phases of 
this project are Identify, Define, Design, Optimize, and Verify. After each, a 
recap or gate will identify the benchmarks and issues with product design 
and development processes.
A Gantt chart was used to keep the project development cycle on track 
and ensure that all key steps in the process were accomplished as shown in 
Figure 4.1. This chart includes dates and tasks that are essential for appropri-
ate usage of time management during the scheduled period of work.
4.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business, and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your 
project?

2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?
4.3  Define Phase
4.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect voice of the customer (VOC): Create a VOC survey to under-
stand the current and potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
4.3.2  Define
The voice of the customer is extremely important when developing a 
product or service that provides satisfaction and innovative features. The 
primary focus here can be analyzed from several customer experiences, 
surveys, and reports. During this stage the team wanted to gather as much 
research from a certain population of individuals. A survey was distrib-
uted to a pool of customers and from their feedback the team was able to 
determine what functions the customer really wanted the military tool kit 
holder clip to perform.
Checklist: Market segment analysis by interviewing customers and per-
forming a market trend forecast to address the question, “Is there 
something like this out on the market yet?” In addition, benchmarking, 
gathering voice of the customer through a survey, affinity diagram, 
quality function deployment, and Kano diagrams were utilized to 
ensure the team was heading in the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information on voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
4.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
The team created a survey designed to help understand the most important 
factors for the tool holder. The team developed this survey specific to the 
customer. After analyzing these requirements, the team constructed affin-
ity diagrams to rank and structure the customer requirements. Customer 
requirements fell into three categories:
	
1.	 Performance
	
2.	 Usability
	
3.	 Style

87
Design of a Military Tool Holder—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
4.3.2.2	 Structuring and Ranking Customer Needs
The main wants and needs of the customer were determined through a sta-
tistical analysis of the surveys which showed:
	
1.	87% of the service members who participated in the survey felt that 
a quick-release detachment would be a great addition to the military 
tool kit holder.
	
2.	Only 11.8% of service members agree with the current design and 
believe that no changes need to be made.
	
3.	20% surveyed made recommendations about increasing ease of use.
4.3.2.3  Analysis of Competitors in the Market
The next step was to identify the competition. Two competitors were identi-
fied, a breaching tool holder and a manual entry tool backpack; both utilize 
existing designs for their tool holders. Neither of these competitors have a 
design that is unique, with a focus on a functional attachment design.
•	 Military tool kit holder (cost $23.25)
•	 Aluminum tube
•	 MOLLE attachment
•	 Manual Entry Tool Backpack (cost $116.99)
•	 Adjustable, nylon backpack
4.3.2.4  Quality Function Deployment
Using the voice of the customer, the team built the House of Quality (HOQ) 
as shown in Figure 4.2. These are the steps the team used to build the HOQ:
Step 1: List the customer requirements.
Step 2: List the technical descriptors (characteristics that will affect more 
than one of the customer requirements, in development or production).
Step 3: Compare the two (customer requirements to technical descrip-
tors) and determine relationships.
Step 4: Develop the positive and negative interrelated attributes and 
identify “trade-offs.”
4.3.2.5  Kano Analysis
In order to identify key customer requirements that will make the prod-
uct more marketable, the team used the Kano model. The Kano model is a

diagram that analyzes customer requirements based on product develop-
ment as shown in Figure 4.3. These requirements that customers rely on can 
be put into three categories:
•	 Basic Characteristics: These are features that are not specifically req­
uested but are assumed to be present. If present, the customer is neither 
satisfied nor dissatisfied. If absent, the customer is very dissatisfied.
•	 Performance Characteristics: These features are specifically requested 
items from the customer. If present, the customer is satisfied. 
However, if absent, the customer is dissatisfied.
•	 Excitement Characteristics: These features are unknown to the cus-
tomer and, therefore, are the most difficult to define and develop. 
If present, the customer is very satisfied and excited. If absent, the 
customer is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.

4.4.2  Design
The process of concept development began with targeting specific issues of 
the current breaching tool holder system. The main issue discovered was 
the attachment mechanism. The next step was to begin initial brainstorming 
and developing redesign concepts for the attachment apparatus. By defining 
and then aligning the voice of the customer, the design requirements were 
identified that were necessary to develop an optimal design.
Checklist: Concept generation technique (Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving [TRIZ], brainstorming), Design for Manufacture and 
Assembly, concept generation, affinity diagrams, Pugh concept eval-
uation and selection

4.4.2.8  Pugh’s Concept Selection
The team created seven different designs through our product development. 
The team then used Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix to determine the con-
cept that had the greatest potential for success and to assist in narrowing 
the scope to a single design as shown in Figure 4.10. The team chose concept 
Design 7 as the datum design. All other designs are compared to the datum 
design relative to each customer need. For each comparison, the concept 
being evaluated is judged to be either better than (“+” score), about the same 
(“s” score), or worse than the datum (“–” score).
The selected design includes the following feature characteristics:
•	 Reversal of the plates, improves comfort and prevents snagging 
from the “ball” appendage
•	 Plate 1 (ball) attached to the holder
•	 Plate 2 (socket with release) attaches to the MOLLE
•	 Addition of the safety skid
•	 Polymer skid attached to the tool holder’s brim
•	 Prevents injury from the tool accidentally sliding out of the holder
4.4.2.9  Detailed Model of the Product Design
Once the components were identified the team developed a detailed model 
for the required design specifications as shown in Figure 4.11. (Note that the 
diagram of the final design is not to scale and is shown in a vertical position. 
The release tabs are actually perpendicular to the holder.)

Because no quantitative design experiments were conducted in this 
DFSS project, the team verified that the optimal design requirements met 
or exceeded the customer requirements (VOC) by showing the prototype 
to potential customers and users. The customer feedback was very positive, 
particularly due to the addition of several “excitement” design qualities:
•	 Performance
•	 Safety, durability, multiple positioning (rotational), safety skid
•	 Usability
•	 Ease of use, speed, lightweight, MOLLE/PALS compatible

4.7  Summary
Our team utilized the Design for Six Sigma process to successfully 
develop and design an attachment system that enhances the current mili-
tary tool kit holder. We are confident that the new attachment will rede-
fine the standards in the breaching tool holder industry and improve the 
military tool kit holder standing in market sales. The users, specifically 
those in the military and tactical law enforcement, will have a system that 
meets their mission-critical equipment needs for durability, ease of use, 
and safety.

5.1  Project Overview
The product chosen was a portable can crusher. The team plans to design a 
revolutionary, semiautomatic, robust, paddle-operated can crusher. The can 
crusher would be designed to crush 16- or 32-ounce cans vertically. The can 
crusher would have an automatic can feed and drop mechanism for continu-
ous operation with a storage of up to eight cans.
5.1.1  Features of Can Crushers Existing in the Market
•	 Price was $70 (automatic can crusher costs on the higher end).
•	 Safety features were provided with medium to high durability.
•	 Measured size was approximately 2 × 1 feet.
•	 Most of them had no rack to store the cans.
•	 Automatic can crushers weighed around 50 lbs while the manual 
ones were around 5 to 10 lbs.
•	 Most were wall mounted with average aesthetics.
•	 An automatic disposal system was present in most of them.
•	 They all accepted only a fixed can size.
The aim of the project is to design a portable can crusher that crushes a can 
to approximately one quarter of its length. The team intends to accommodate

two varieties of aluminum cans. It is designed to be eco-friendly and be an 
ergonomic design. The primary market is household consumers. This can 
crusher could also be used for light, commercial applications such as restau-
rants, bars, hotels, motels, and gas stations.
Team requirements and expectations include designing the can crusher 
based on the voice of the customer (VOC) using Design for Six Sigma 
(DFSS) tools and techniques to result in a more efficient and organized 
design process.
The team identified several project boundaries. The first boundary was 
that the design would only use available technology. The second boundary 
was the final design should have a price range of $30 to $50.
5.2  Identify Phase
5.2.1  Identify Phase Activities
It is recommended that students work in project teams of three to four 
students throughout the DFSS case study.
	
1.	Develop Project Charter: Use the information provided in the Project 
Overview section to develop a project charter for the DFSS project.
	
2.	Team Ground Rules and Roles: Develop the project team’s ground rules 
and team members’ roles.
	
3.	Develop Project Plan: Develop your team’s project plan for the DFSS 
project.
5.2.2  Identify
5.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Portable garbage crusher system
Project Overview: The goal for the Design for Six Sigma team is to design 
a portable crusher system that is able to crush cans and plastics 
(glasses) of comparable size. The crusher would be attachable to a 
waste basket or recycler with three compartments (i.e., one each for 
metals, plastics, and glass) and would also have other attachments 
such as a can opener, a bottle opener, and a drain at the bottom for 
any leakages or leftover liquids if the cost and design permit. The 
cost of the system would be approximately $50.

106
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Problem Statement: Today the garbage is usually tossed into the waste 
container directly, which occupies a lot of space in the waste bin. 
Also, the current garbage crusher systems available in the market do 
not have the option to segregate the garbage into metals, plastics, and 
glass. Using this system the team is planning to build one that can 
crush the garbage and dispose of it directly into the wastebasket that 
would be attached. Also, this would be a boost for the recycling effort 
where companies could provide incentives to households for using 
this system. In addition, this system would have to be reasonably 
priced compared to the available ones in the market to be successful 
in the market.
 Customer/Stakeholders: General public, garbage collectors, and the recy-
cling companies. What is important to these customers: ease in use 
of the system, cost of the system, ergonomic design, and helps in the 
recycling effort.
Goal of the Project: To build a cheap and portable crusher system.
Scope Statement: The cost of the proposed crusher system has to be 
almost comparable to the current systems already present in the 
market, which cost around $30 to $50. Also, there may be a financial 
benefit for households if the recycling and garbage disposal compa-
nies agree to reward the respective households.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): The garbage, as it is already segregated 
into metals, plastics, and glass, will be much easier to recycle, and if 
viable, the recycling companies or garbage disposal companies can 
provide incentives to households that use this system as it makes 
their work easier.
5.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.

5.2.2.3  Project Plan
In order to achieve a breakthrough design and successful product commer-
cialization, the team used a structured and disciplined approach of phases 
and gates in the project plan. The structure consisted of four phases along 
with four gates. The team also implemented the use of checklists to iden-
tify the tools and best practices that were required to fulfill a gate deliver-
able within a phase. Scorecards were implemented to compare the actual 
deliverables obtained at each gate versus the required deliverables that were 
to be accomplished at each gate. The four phases and gates are shown in 
Figure 5.1.
5.2.2.3.1  Phase/Gate 1—Identify
In the Identify phase the team developed the project charter, performed a 
stakeholder analysis, and created the project plan.
Checklist: Project charter, stakeholder definition, stakeholder analysis, 
ground rules, project plan
5.2.2.3.2  Phase/Gate 2—Define
In this phase, the aim was to research the market and gather customer 
requirements otherwise known as “voice of the customer.” These needs were 
then translated to useful metrics, prioritized, and evaluated to obtain a clear 
understanding on customer requirements.
Checklist: Market segment analysis, benchmarking, survey, House of 
Quality, quality function deployment (QFD), Kano analysis
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in market
•	 Gathering information on voice of the customer
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them

flaws and their effects and probable solutions on how to reduce them. The 
team also compared the influence of one factor on another.
Checklist: Design failure mode and effects analysis (DFMEA), computer-
aided engineering (CAE) analysis
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors that influence one other
•	 Identifying probable solutions to failure

from customers by providing them with prototypes.
Checklist: Virtual prototyping, survey
•	 Prototype approved by customer
•	 Meets large portion of customer needs
•	 Ease to manufacture and cost estimate
•	 Reliable performance
A Gantt chart was developed in order to maintain the pace of the project. A 
detailed timeline for the various tasks within each phase was developed as 
shown in Figure 5.2. This chart was used to compare the current tasks being 
carried out to the planned schedule.

a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business, and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for 
your project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?

5.3  Define Phase
5.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect VOC: Create a VOC survey to understand current and poten-
tial customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
5.3.2  Define
In this phase, the aim was to research the recycling and can crusher market 
and gather customer requirements to capture the VOC through the use of an 
online survey.
Checklist: Perform market segment analysis by visiting local and 
online stores and performing a market trend forecast to address 
the question, “Is there something like this out on the market 
yet?” In addition, benchmarking, gathering voice of the customer 
through survey, affinity diagram, quality function deployment, 
and Kano diagrams were utilized to ensure the team was heading 
in the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information of voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
5.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
In order to identify the needs of the customer, a survey consisting of essen-
tial questions was created. This survey was circulated among various 
communities with students in the majority. The greatest needs of the cus-
tomer were identified as shown in Figure 5.3.

111
Design of a Can Crusher—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
Therefore, from the survey results, it was concluded that the following 
were the preferred customer needs (in descending order):
•	 Safe
•	 Less Cost ($25 to $35)
•	 Durable
•	 Portable
•	 Aesthetically pleasing
Also, customers preferred a can crusher from which some monetary return 
or incentive could be obtained.
5.3.2.2  Structuring and Ranking Customer Needs
Once the needs were identified the team started with rating those needs so 
that the focus could be on the most important and critical needs as shown 
in Figure 5.4.
5.3.2.3  Analysis of Competitors in the Market
The next step was to analyze the current competitors in the market by visit-
ing local department stores and analyzing different brands. Then an exten-
sive Web search was conducted to study the features that are provided on 
the current products. Five competitors were identified for benchmarking our 
product (see Figure 5.5).
5.3.2.4  Quality Function Deployment
Based on the voice of customer and competitor’s product analysis, a House of 
Quality was built (see Figure 5.6) as follows:
Step 1: Based on the VOC, the team developed a technical design 
requirement matrix and then determined the relationship between 
the customer and engineering requirements.

Step 2: These requirements were also compared with the products 
already available in the market.
Step 3: The interrelationship between the technical metrics (engineer-
ing characteristics) was studied.
Step 4: Based on the VOC need ranking and technical values, the team 
determined the difficulty level for each of the design requirements.
5.3.2.5  Product Design Metrics
The next step was to develop the design characteristics metrics to target 
the ideal specifications that will meet the design requirements as shown in 
Figure 5.7.
5.3.2.6  Kano Analysis
For the new integrated design of the portable can crusher, the team used the 
Kano analysis to identify whether the product was meeting the basic cus-
tomer’s one-dimensional needs and expected quality. It was also useful in 
identifying exciting quality features that could be implemented, which gave 
the product an advantage over our competitors, and vice versa.
There are certain quality standards that must be implemented and used 
in conceptual design. These expected qualities that had to be present in the

design were high durability of the product, low cost, and high priority for 
safety. In addition, customers were willing to pay more if portability was an 
option. The exciting attributes that were also attempted in the design were 
being a totally semiautomated system and having a recycling return cost 
from selling crushed cans to recyclers.
Fundamentals: Durability, cost, safety
Linear: Portability
Exciters: Automated, recycling return cost

1.	 Identify process elements.
	
2.	 Design process.
	
3.	 Identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
5.4.2  Design
After passing the Define gate of DFSS, the product enters into the Design 
phase. Here, the team developed design concepts with regard to the cus-
tomer requirements and evaluated each of those concepts to identify the best 
and most practical design that satisfies customer needs.
Checklist: Concept generation technique (Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving [TRIZ], brainstorming), design for manufacture and assem-
bly, concept generation, affinity diagrams, Pugh concept evaluation 
and selection
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Generating seven design concepts that meet customer requirements
•	 Evaluating superior concepts and superior technology to beat 
the market
•	 Analyzing and studying feasibility of superior concepts—look-
ing at the competitors
•	 Adding value to the design by thinking “outside the box”
5.4.2.1  Concept I
Concept I (shown in Figure  5.9) uses a specially designed cam/follower 
mechanism to push the piston down to crush the can. The standout feature is 
the automatic operation (push of a button) that exerts a high crushing force. 
The disadvantage with this system is that the cam/follower mechanism is 
expensive to manufacture, which in turn results in the product being very 
expensive. It should also be noted that power will be needed to drive the 
cam, which would add cost.
5.4.2.2  Concept II
In Concept II (shown in Figure 5.10) a pneumatic activated piston is used to 
crush the can. Here a small manual force would be required, and it has a 
very high crushing force. The disadvantage is the floor space requirement. 
In addition, a compressor would be needed to actuate the pneumatic pump, 
which would add cost.

117
Design of a Can Crusher—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
5.4.2.3  Concept III
In Concept III (shown in Figure 5.11) two power screws are used to con-
vert the rotational movement of the crank/lever into crushing force. The two 
power screws are interlocked. In addition, a slot is provided for the crushed 
can to drop down. The disadvantage with this design is that a considerable 
amount of energy is wasted, and manufacturing the screws would make the 
design expensive overall. Finally, this crusher needs to be wall mounted, 
which curbs its portability.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
5.4.2.4  Concept IV
Concept IV (shown in Figure 5.12) is a modification of Concept III. This is a 
vertical design; therefore, two bevel gears are used in addition to the two 
power screws. The bevel gears are used to transmit the rotational movement 
of the lever to the power screws to crush the cans. The disadvantage is that 
the cost of manufacturing of bevel gears is quite high, which increases the 
price of the overall product. Also, the can disposal feed must be manual, 
which can make it unsafe.
5.4.2.5  Concept V
In Concept V (shown in Figure 5.13), only a single horizontal power screw is 
used to provide the crushing force. The crank/lever is directly connected to 
the power screw. Also as in all of the other designs, there is a slot provided 
for the crushed can to drop through. This design is quite energy efficient, but 
the only disadvantage is that it will take a long time to crush the can, and it 
is comparatively tedious to operate.
5.4.2.6  Concept VI
The sixth concept (shown in Figure 5.14) was based on a slider concept. Here 
the crank/lever is connected to the piston or crushing plate with the use of 
a link. Pulling down on the lever would pull the plate forward, thus crush-
ing the can. This mechanism is quite simple. The disadvantage is that this 
crusher must be mounted to a wall, which curbs its portability.

5.4.2.7  Concept VII
This design (shown in Figure 5.15) has a pedal for the force to be applied. It 
also has a mechanism for automatic feed of the cans. Pushing the pedal would 
move the crank forward crushing the can. When retracting the piston, the next 
can would fall into place. The rack was designed to hold eight cans.
5.4.2.8  Pugh’s Concept Selection
Initial brainstorming for concept generation resulted in seven rough con-
cepts as explained in the previous section. The next step was to rank these 
concepts to select the ideal concept. A Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix was 
developed to narrow the focus to a single design alternative as shown in 
Figure 5.16.
This Pugh’s concept selection chart compared all the concept designs with 
Concept Design 1 taken as the datum design. From the chart it was decided 
that Concept Design 7 was the best choice. Therefore, it was taken as our 
final design.
FIGURE 5.14
Concept VI.

121
Design of a Can Crusher—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
5.4.2.9  Concept/Design Development
The design can be decomposed in different mechanisms according to the 
functions (i.e., slot disposal, retraction mechanism, pedal retaining mech-
anism, automatic feed mechanism) they perform. The team developed a 
functional decomposition chart that provides the interrelationship between 
different modules/subsystems. This chart helped the team to identify the 
different components necessary to build the final product.
5.4.2.10  Detailed Model of the Product Design
Once the components were identified the team developed a detailed model 
for the required design specifications as shown in Figure 5.17.
The design actually consists of four mechanisms (shown in Figures 5.18 
and 5.19)—that is, the slot mechanism, retraction mechanism, pedal retain-
ing mechanism, and the automatic feed mechanism.
The slot disposal is provided in order to avoid manually removing the 
crushed can. The crushed can is approximately 30% of the size of the original 
can. Therefore, the can crusher can be placed right above a recycling bin.
The retraction mechanism is provided to push back the piston to its origi-
nal location so it is ready to crush the next can.
The pedal retaining mechanism is used to hold the pedal in the correct 
position (i.e., in the horizontal position). After pressing down on the pedal, 
the springs return the pedal back to the original position.

Design of a Can Crusher—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
Designing the automatic feed mechanism was the biggest challenge. The 
mechanism has been specially designed in such a way that it actuates only 
when the existing can in the cylinder is crushed to 30% or less of its original 
size, which ensures that no new can enters the cylinder until the crushed can 
is disposed of. When the piston crushes the can to 30% the extended dowel 
pin pushes the bottom link against the springs. This then pushes the top link

that is positioned in the rack and displaces and forces the next can down. 
Once the piston retracts, the mechanism returns to the original position as a 
result of the spring action.
5.4.2.11  Design for X (DFX)
During the later stages of product development, teams often face difficulties in 
relating the design requirements to customer needs. This is where DFX steps 
into action. Design for X is a general term where X could mean any quality or 
cost criteria that affect the product. In the project several DFX tools were used.
5.4.2.12  Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA)
After finalizing the concept design, it was determined that the components 
for the product will not be manufactured in house. The components will 
be outsourced and the product will be assembled in house. A detailed DFA 
matrix was developed to determine the total assembly time as shown in 
Figure 5.20. The team prepared the bill of materials (BOM) and the total cost 
of the product (including the material and labor cost) was determined. Please 
note that costs have been calculated taking into consideration bulk orders for 
at least 1000 units.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
This matrix helps the team determine how easily these components can be 
assembled together. It provides the method of fastening for each individual 
part and gives information if tools are required to assemble the respective 
part. In addition, the estimated assembly time was determined by the team 
as shown in Figure 5.21.
The total time for assembly was found to be 5 min 20 sec.
Labor Cost:
Assumed labor cost = $15/hour
This calculated time is an approximate time; therefore, the team 
added a buffer time.
Therefore, the total time = 6 min/part
Thus, the number of parts manufactured in 1 hour is 10 parts/hour.
Total cost of the materials = $30.60
Total labor cost = $1.50/piece
Total Cost = Material cost + Labor cost = $30.60 + $1.50 = $32.10

In this phase, the team reviewed the selected superior concept to identify the 
probable problems, major factors involved, and their possible causes. The team 
also compared the influence of one factor on another and outside noise factors.
Checklist: Design of experiments, failure mode effect analysis, analy-
sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical 
parameter management
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors from both customers 
and competitors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors influencing each other
•	 Determining probable solutions to failure
5.5.2.1	 Critical Parameter Management
First, the team created a process diagram with the help of a cause-and-effect 
diagram to identify the probable problems, major factors involved, and their 
possible causes. For testing the design, the team next developed a param-
eter diagram (P-diagram) that identified the control factors, noise factors, 
and the measurement metrics as shown in Figure 5.22. A P-diagram takes 
into account all the noise factors and identifies certain control parameters

designed to minimize the losses in performance. This results in a more 
robust design. This P-diagram is then used in preparation for the design 
failure mode and effects analysis (DFMEA).

5.6.2  Validate Phase
In this phase, the team verified the final design parameters with responses 
from customers.
Checklist: Measurement system analysis, manufacturing process capa-
bility study, reliability assessment, worst case analysis, analytical 
tolerance design.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Prototype approved by customer
•	 Meets large portion of customer needs
•	 Ease to manufacture and cost estimate
•	 Reliability performance	
The DFMEA was developed by first studying the can crusher and brain-
storming the possible failures, their consequences, and their severity. Based 
upon those, the team assigned scores for the probable failures to calculate the 
risk priority number (RPN). This number was then used as a metric to rank 
the failures, determine corrective actions, and make recommendations for 
improvement. The DFMEA is provided in Figure 5.23.
The DFMEA was useful in anticipating probable failures that could arise 
downstream during production or during customer use. Therefore, it was 
useful in preventing design failures.
5.6.2.3  Verification Setup
The verification of the product design on Concept VII will be determined 
in two major parts. The first part will analyze the capability of the product 
design functional performance. The team will analyze the capability of pro-
duction, assembly, and manufacturing processes within the business com-
ponent. The team conducted a design concept evaluation in the university 
machine shop where it was determined that the design was feasible. This 
analysis should be straightforward on how to implement current products. 
For the second part the team conducted a survey of 30 people to anticipate 
how the public will respond to the product and their satisfaction toward it. 
The prototype was shown to potential customers, and they were asked if 
the design met their requirements in the categories of safety, cost, portabil-
ity, durability, function, and aesthetics. The results are given in Figure 5.24. 
Based on the survey response, the design was verified to be successful.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
5.7  Summary
Developing a new product platform is a very lengthy and rigorous process. 
The product design has been shown to account for as much as 80% of the 
total product cost. Hence, the design process is the most important phase of 
the overall product development process and, if not managed efficiently, can 
cost the company additional cost, time, and resources.
The DFSS methodology is key in the design process and when applied 
effectively results in a robust and reliable design. The tools used and the 
gating system in DFSS ensure that no design flaws pass to the next phase 
unnoticed, and the problems are rectified upstream before the product 
enters production.
As a Six Sigma team, we were able to innovate a commercial portable can 
crusher with greater customer satisfaction. We were able to gain valuable 
insight into our potential customers’ needs and translate them into a feasible 
concept that was then redesigned and proved to be commercially viable.
By implementing DFSS throughout the entire conceptualization and rede-
signing process, we were able to develop a portable can crusher that could 
be manufactured and assembled with minimal production failures as well 
as maintaining our overhead and rework costs at a minimum. Overall we 
were able to meet our project goals within the boundaries and limitations 
imposed on the project.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
6.1  Project Overview
In chemical and hospital laboratories, small liquid spills are a frequent 
occurrence. Chemical students and medical laboratory personnel use rags 
or paper towels to mop up these liquids, exposing themselves to chemical 
or biological risks. Individuals working in these facilities need a product 
that would cater to their needs of rapid and safer spill cleaning. The current 
mopping method practiced is time consuming and may be dangerous. With 
the help of Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) principles, the goal of this team is 
to design a mop that would absorb approximately 250 mL of chemical or 
biological liquid spill faster than methods currently in practice and with a 
stand-off distance of 4 feet ensuring operator safety.
Our goal is to design a cleaning mop to clear chemical and biological 
liquid spills so as to reduce cleaning time presently required with ordi-
nary mops, thus minimizing exposure to spilled hazardous materials. 
The mop is provided with a sponge strip to primarily absorb liquid and 
a synthetic fiber strip to drag up all that remains of the spill. A product 
with all of these features will approximately cost in the $50 to $60 range. 
Liquid-specific absorbing sponges would be available in different sizes 
and capacities.
The product design focuses on
	
1.	Reducing applied force while mopping
	
2.	Providing custom-made sponges withstanding acids and bases, and 
volatile, flammable, aromatic, body fluids—absorb approximately 
200 mL of liquid
	
3.	Discharging mechanism for the used sponge (without touching it)
To assemble our product, the following components are required:
	
1.	Plastic body/staff (4 ft long) with synthetic fiber strip attached at the 
distal end
	
2.	Synthetic fiber strip (to draw the leftover liquid)

3.	Another plastic piece holding the detachable sponge with concentric 
annuli
	
4.	Spill-specific sponges
The design of the product is based on the voice of the customer (VOC). 
DFSS will help the design process to be more efficient and organized. 
The team expects the chemist, school laboratory, medical laboratory com-
munities, and research and development (R&D) laboratories in chemical 
industries to be the primary markets. The product should yield a 2-year 
duty life, with the sponges required to be changed after every use and 
disposed of responsibly. The absorbing sponges are biodegradable and 
thus are eco-friendly. The team plans to buy spill-specific sponges, fabri-
cate them to fit the product design, and supply them to the customers both 
wholesale and retail.
6.2  Identify Phase
6.2.1  Identify Phase Activities
It is recommended that students work in project teams of three to four 
students throughout the DFSS case study.
	
1.	Develop Project Charter: Use the information provided in the Project 
Overview section to develop a project charter for the DFSS project.
	
2.	Team Ground Rules and Roles: Develop the project team’s ground rules 
and team members’ roles.
	
3.	Develop Project Plan: Develop your team’s project plan for the DFSS 
project.
6.2.2  Identify
6.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: ChemiClean
Project Overview: This product is being considered for production for 
cleaning of hazardous liquid spills. As part of our enduring efforts 
toward safer and better laboratory cleaning procedures, this team 
has considered several options for cleaning of harmful substances. 
The product (named ChemiClean during the development cycle) is 

136
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
designed to clean small liquid chemical spills faster than methods 
currently in practice, ensuring operator safety.
Problem Statement: In chemical and hospital laboratories, small liquid 
spills are a frequent occurrence. Chemical students and medical lab-
oratory personnel use rags or paper towels to mop up these liquids, 
exposing themselves to chemical or biological risks. Individuals 
working in these facilities need a product that would cater to their 
needs of rapid and safer spill cleaning. The current mopping method 
practiced is time consuming and dangerous.
Customer/Stakeholders: Chemists, school laboratories, medical laborato-
ries, R&D laboratories in chemical industries
Goal of the Project: Reduce time required to clean up liquid chemical 
spills, and thus minimize exposure to hazardous materials
Scope Statement: The project is limited to the university campus where 
the team is currently attending classes. The team would conduct a 
survey along with a field test, among students and medical labo-
ratory personnel at the North Chicago Veterans Affairs Hospital. 
Product applications and scope of the project are limited to medi-
cal and chemical laboratories, due to location restrictions of the 
student team.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): There are no financial benefits in store for 
the team while developing this product. However, the consumer will 
benefit immensely with regard to time spent cleaning up chemical 
spills coupled with increased cleaning efficiency.
6.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.

137
Design of a Hazardous Chemical Cleanup System
6.2.2.3  Project Plan
The project was managed through use of a Gantt chart and a task plan. On 
establishing the idea/concept (Invent), a customer survey was deployed in 
order to gather customer views. The Gantt chart shows project phases, noting 
that phases were not completed in parallel, but in series. However, some of the 
subtasks were completed in parallel. The developed design was optimized 
and verified using scorecards, which helped in determining which phases 
could be revisited in order to further improve the product and the process.
A Gantt chart was utilized to maintain the pace of the project and track 
whether tasks are being carried out per the schedule as shown in Figure 6.1.
6.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example provided? 
How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?

VOC is a market research technique that produces a detailed set of cus-
tomer wants and needs, organized into a hierarchical structure, and then 
prioritized in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current 
alternatives. Online surveys were a source for quantitative research, while 
conversations with potential customers were the primary source for qualita-
tive research. Responses from 15 participants were analyzed and customer 
needs were sorted into the following categories:
	
1.	Cleaning kit particulars
	
2.	Spills ranked in the order of frequency of confrontation
	
3.	Current competitors
Checklist: Market segment analysis by visiting local stores, performing 
a market search online, and performing a market trend forecast to 
address the question, “Is there something like this out on the mar-
ket yet?” In addition, benchmarking, gathering voice of the customer 
through survey, affinity diagrams, quality function deployment, and 
Kano diagrams were utilized to ensure the team was heading in the 
right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information on voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
6.3.2.1  Identifying and Ranking the “Voice of the Customer”
After identifying all the wants and needs of the customer, the team ranked 
and sorted them to realize the most important and critical needs. The VOC 
was structured and ranked based on customer preferences:
	
1.	Particulars of the cleaning unit (Figure 6.2)
	
2.	Spills ranked in the order of frequency of confrontation (Figure 6.3)
	
3.	 Current competitors (Figure 6.4)

6.3.2.2  Quality Function Deployment
The House of Quality (HOQ) helped the team to transform the VOC into 
required engineering characteristics for the product as shown in Figure 6.5. 
This prioritized each of the product characteristics while simultaneously set-
ting product development targets.
Based on the VOC, the team developed a technical design requirement 
matrix and then determined the relationship between the customer and 
engineering requirements. The interaction between the technical metrics 
(engineering characteristics) was studied. Based on the VOC need ranking 
and technical values, the team determined the difficulty level for each of the 
design requirements. Finally, the team compared our product characteristics 
with our competitors in the market.

6.4.2  Design
At this point the team began the Design phase. During this phase the team 
took results attained through the HOQ analysis and brainstormed the best 
ways to effectively and efficiently respond to the technical and customer 
requirements. During this brainstorming process, each member of the team 
developed models he or she felt best met those requirements and offered them 
back to the group for critique and advice. Through this iterative process, the 
group developed seven designs for the sponge/squeegee configuration and 
two designs for the ChemiClean main unit. The unit was broken down as 
shown in Figure 6.8.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Concept I (see Figure 6.10): Provide a straight squeegee 12″ × 1/2″ made 
of synthetic fiber on the trailing edge of the ChemiClean system (the 
last portion to come in contact with the contaminated area). This 
squeegee ensures hazardous liquid consolidates and absorbs into 
the sponge. Provide a straight sponge 12″ × 2″ that serves as the 
absorption element in the ClemiClean system.
Concept II (see Figure 6.11): Provide a curved synthetic fiber squeegee 
1/2″ thick with a radius of 8″ to the inner edge and located on the 
trailing edge of the ChemiClean system. Provide a curved sponge 
2″ thick with a radius of 5.5″ to the inner edge of the sponge. This 
design ensures the hazardous liquid is contained within the system 
and not allowed to escape around the edges.
Concept III (see Figure  6.12): Provide two straight synthetic fiber 
squeegees 8″ × 1/2″ positioned at a 45° angle on either side of the 
ChemiClean system. The purpose of these squeegees is to redirect 
any remaining hazardous liquid into the middle of the ChemiClean 
system for collection. Provide two 2″ × 8″ sponges positioned at 
a 45° angle on either side of the ChemiClean system and aligned 
to the inner side of the squeegees. Provide a third sponge, 3″ × 3″

Concept IV (see Figure 6.13): Provide one straight synthetic fiber squee-
gee 12″ × 1/2″ positioned on the trailing edge of the ChemiClean 
system. Provide two 12″ × 2″ sponges, one in front of the other on the 
leading edge of the ChemiClean system. The second sponge is flush 
with the synthetic fiber squeegee to ensure complete absorption of 
all remaining hazardous liquid.
Concept V (see Figure 6.14): Provide one straight synthetic fiber squeegee 
12″ × 1/2″ positioned on the trailing edge of the ChemiClean system. 
Provide one sponge shaped as an inverted isosceles triangle with a 
12″ base and a height of 8″. This design absorbs an initial quantity of 
liquid with its leading edge and provides a large surface area along 
the squeegee’s face to ensure complete absorption upon completion 
of cleaning.

with a radius of 8″ positioned within the concave portion of the syn-
thetic fiber squeegee.

Concept I (see Figure 6.17): Provide a 4.5-ft-long pole equipped with a 
handle on the top and a plate on the bottom on which a permanent 
synthetic fiber squeegee is mounted that has the ability to mount 
removable sponges. The mechanism used to lock the sponge in place 
is a spring-loaded hooking mechanism enabled by a wire pulley sys-
tem. The wire pulley system continues up the pole and is connected

to a trigger that disengages the sponge when pulled. This system 
allows for reclamation and disposal of hazardous liquid while keep-
ing the user 4.5 ft away from the spill.
Concept II (see Figure  6.18): Provide a 4.5-ft-long pole equipped with 
a foam-gripped handle on one end and a rigid plate on the other. 
Provide a second pole that surrounds the first and is able to move 
freely along its length. This second pole has a foam-padded grip on 
its upper end and a rigid plate on the other. Sponges are attached 
to the plate on the second pole by snapping the nubs on the top of 
the sponge into the holes drilled into the second pole’s rigid plate. 
These nubs pass through the first pole’s rigid plate without effort 
because the holes drilled into the first pole’s rigid plate are larger in 
diameter than the sponge’s nubs. The sponge is released by holding

nated receptacle.
6.4.2.3  Pugh’s Concept Selection
Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix helps the team quantitatively rank each con-
cept by assigning a metric that compares that concept to a baseline product. 
That baseline product may be either a competitor from which you intend on 
drawing market share or in the case of redesign, your product’s earlier model.
As this product is completely new and there are no similar products 
currently on the market, the team adopted the standard mop as the base-
line. The team then developed a list of criteria for comparison based on 
the voice of the customer used to build the House of Quality. The team 
then created a spreadsheet (see Figure 6.19) composed of the criteria for

comparison as row headers and the seven concepts and baseline as col-
umn headers. Using a scale from 1 to 5 (5 being fully capable and 1 being 
incapable), the team ranked the baseline for every criteria for compari-
son. Similarly, the team annotated how each of the concepts (I through 
VII) compared to the baseline using the criteria: better (+), same (S), and 
worse  (–). Additionally, the team assigned each of these comparisons a 
point value of 5, 3, and 1, respectively. These values were later used to 
compare each concept and select the best.

In this phase, the team explored how the output factors were affected by 
changes in the input factors. To accomplish this, the team took advantage 
of several DFSS tools. First, the team used design of experiments to obtain a 
quantitative assessment of the criticality of key parameters. Next, a parameter 
diagram was developed to help with the design of experiments (DOE).

sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical

•	 Identifying factors influence with one other

6.5.2.1  Design of Experiments
The team used design of experiments to understand the outputs that were 
affected by different inputs into the system (see Figure  6.20). This method 
allowed the team to optimize results in targeted areas based on the results from 
the voice of the customer and the required functioning parameters. The team 
determined the most cost-effective way to conduct product development.
The input variables selected were the following: sponge release, extending 
pole, and spill absorption. Each factor had two levels, high and low, which 
relate to the input factors being present and absent as shown in Figure 6.21. The 
output factor of interest is the customer satisfaction rating, 1 to 5. Customers 
were to assign a satisfaction value for each of the following experimental 
runs. The data obtained from this experiment were used to compute which 
factor has the highest influence on customer satisfaction. Overall, it was clear 
that the absorption capability was the most important, as a certain level was 
expected. However, the opportunity to deliver highly satisfied results exists 
also, if greater absorption is combined with the other two features.

Design of a Hazardous Chemical Cleanup System
Functional Analysis System Technique (FAST) and Fault tree diagrams were 
used in the development phase of the project. The FAST tree shows a picture 
of the important functions of the product, helps ensure a common under-
standing of the system functions, as well as acts as a tool to envision any 
hardware solutions or missing components as shown in Figure 6.22.
The Fault tree aids in defining the signal, control, and noise factors that 
would affect the product, thus helping the team improve the robustness 
design and identify specific failures that the customer may encounter and 
appropriate troubleshooting for those failures as shown in Figure 6.23.
6.6.2.1  Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
During the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) the goal is to quan-
titatively rank the failure modes and effects for the product. This process 
allows the team to take preventative action that will improve resistance 
to failure modes and also to minimize the effects of failure. This FMEA 
was developed by analyzing the design and figuring out the likely failure 
scenarios and their effects as shown in Figure 6.24. Two prominent failure 
modes were identified during this analysis. First, the pole is rigid or not 
responding to physical input with a risk priority number (RPN) of 28, and 
second the sponge stuck to plate, with a RPN of 24. These are the highest

RPNs and should be addressed, as these failures disrupt one of the pri-
mary requirements as determined by the VOC. The use of a plastic ball 
and socket would eliminate much of the stress put on this joint and allow 
for greater flexibility during use. As for the sticky sponge problem, using 
the product properly can result in this failure. This should be addressed 
by using a nonstick material or coating on the portion of the plate that 
comes in contact with the chemical-soaked sponge. This analysis is quite 
valuable in spotting and correcting potential failures before production 
has even begun.
6.6.2.2  Design Capability Study
One of the critical parameters as identified in the VOC portion was the 
amount of liquid that can be absorbed in a single use. The team conducted 
preliminary research to determine which commercially available sponge 
should be purchased to mold and fit to the product, and also to determine 
how much liquid this reformed sponge can absorb. In this capability study 
the team will determine the amount of liquid absorbed per ChemiClean 
sponge as shown in Figure 6.25. Recall that the team will be buying off-the- 
shelf sponges and fitting them to the product.
FIGURE 6.24
Design failure mode and effects analysis.

157
Design of a Hazardous Chemical Cleanup System
The key metric determined here is the total amount of fluid that a 
ChemiClean sponge can absorb, denoted by the boxes. This was determined 
by finding out how much liquid 1 in2 of the sponge could absorb, then mul-
tiplying it by 33 in2, the area of a ChemiClean sponge. The first two differ 
in absorption by only 3/10 of a milliliter, with the second one being cheaper 
by 2/10 of a cent. The minimum value required according to the VOC is 
100 mL and is easily achieved. However, the 250 mL needed to achieve the 
excitement factor will require the use of two ChemiClean sponges. Last, the 
oil specialty sponge seems to perform the best if the spill is a hydrocarbon, 
as it absorbs the most and is cheaper. Pursuing an oil specialty ChemiClean 
sponge seems worthwhile as well.
6.6.2.2.1  Cost
As part of this phase, an estimated cost was determined:
Total retail cost: $30
Total manufacturing cost: ~$16
Pole: $10
Sponge: $0.06
Synthetic fiber: $6.00
6.6.2.2.2  Verify Setup
The feasibility of conceptual design, production, assembly, and manu-
facturing capability of Concept III (sponge) and II (main unit) were veri-
fied in this phase. The scorecard for the Concept verification is shown in 
Figure 6.26.
Also, the components necessary for product manufacture are readily avail-
able and are functional to meet product design demands. There would be no 
time constraints hampering production of this unit. Fulfillment of the above 
validation phase allows Concept IIIsponge and IImain unit to enter the commer-
cial market (only after filing the copyright laws), and thus be delivered to the 
customers.

6.7  Summary
The team implemented the DFSS methodology (Identify-Define-Design-
Optimize-Validate, IDDOV) to develop a robust and reliable design of a mop 
especially for use in chemical and biological liquid spills. The team was able 
to start with an idea, present it to potential customers, and discovered that 
they could develop the technology to be robust from an engineering stand-
point, and also be robust to unique customer requirements. The phase and 
gate system of DFSS ensured no design flaws crept into the next phase, and 
problems could be rectified upstream before the product entered the mass 
production phase.
The final design consisted of Sponge Design 3 and Pole Design 2. This 
product answers the VOC through use of HOQ, keeps technicians away 
from hazardous liquids, and is reusable and portable. The final product is 
priced at $20 to $30 with a safe stand-off distance of 4 ft, a synthetic fiber strip 
acting as a squeegee, and replaceable sponge units.
The team was able to develop a mop that could be assembled and manu-
factured with minimum production failures, simultaneously keeping the 
overhead and rework costs to a minimum. The team is also prepared with 
emergency responses to manage mishaps downstream. Thus the IDDOV 
process helped the team streamline the development, as well as aided in 
optimizing the design based on voice of the customer; ensuring the project 
goals were met within the imposed project boundaries and limitations.

7.1  Project Overview
Wireless handset users have the ability to call into the customer contact cen-
ter to create a ticket for any network trouble that may be occurring. Customer 
complaints can range from roaming, poor coverage, to no service in a specific 
location. The bandwidth frequency of the towers must follow the standards 
set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The area where the 
radio frequency (RF) tower is deployed often has no previous data analysis 
performed to justify the selection of land. As a consequence, the chosen area 
may not be the most ideal to provide peak performance of the tower, hence 
creating an unnecessary high cost.
The goal of the project is to determine a new design of directional radio 
frequency on the current Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) third-
generation (3G) platform and to determine if the added performance of the 
new design of towers is high enough to justify the extra cost. The redesign 
goal is to increase the coverage area by 30% and decrease the network cov-
erage trouble tickets by 50%.
The requirements and expectations of the project include the following:
•	 A design that will be appealing to the voice of the customer (VOC).
•	 A recommendation of a new design of directional RF on monopole 
towers for better area coverage or requirements for land a tower is 
built on.
•	 An expectation is that by using Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) the cus-
tomer complaint tickets will drop by 50% to justify redesign.
The project boundary in scope for this project is shown in Figure 7.1 as the 
device under test (DUT). The scope will only cover customers who are mak-
ing an in-network mobile-to-mobile call with complete disregard to roaming 
and intercarrier customer calls.

Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
The tower emits an RF signal in three directions hypothetically covering 
a strong signal in a 7-mile diameter from the tower. The customer’s signal 
shown on the handset will be dependent on the traffic on the tower and the 
customer’s distance from the tower. It should also be noted that a single sec-
tor on the tower can carry up to 20 calls instantaneously, and most towers 
carry an average of nine sectors.
In order to ensure consistency, the highest traffic complaints area has been 
chosen to represent the experiment. Figure 7.2 is an example of triangular direc-
tional RF emission, which is the standard used on the network infrastructure.
In order to move forward with the evaluated recommendations, the fol-
lowing project boundaries were developed:
•	 Does not raise cost to customers by more than 5%
•	 Uses current technology resources and support
•	 Notes space restrictions
•	 Follows local zoning laws
•	 Adheres to FCC regulations

7.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Wireless handset ticket resolution time reduction
Project Overview: The Design for Six Sigma team has set an objective 
to expand the coverage area of the current RF towers in a major 
metropolitan area to decrease network trouble tickets for coverage 
issues. The project aims to reduce by 50% the network trouble tick-
ets generated by customer dissatisfaction and increase the current 
network coverage by 30%.
FIGURE 7.2

163
Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
Problem Statement: The DFSS team needs to reduce the number of net-
work trouble tickets created by wireless handsets not receiving a sat-
isfactory level of coverage. The trouble tickets need to be reduced by 
50% to justify the cost of redesigning the RF towers to increase the 
coverage by 30% and possibly upgrading to 4G (fourth generation). 
After analysis of the current state, the team will decide what option 
to pursue.
	
	 The reduction of customer complaints will reduce labor expenses 
for call centers and RF engineers. The company is looking to be more 
flexible with the current workforce. Reducing the number of tick-
ets and coverage failures will allow for cross-functional workers to 
cover more areas of the job. The company will also be able to lease 
out tower space and coverage to smaller companies, and with a cov-
erage that is more reliable it will be easier to sell.
Customer/Stakeholders: Wireless handset users, smaller wireless compa-
nies, stockholders, employees, and suppliers. What is important to 
these customers (critical to satisfaction, CTS): all of the customers 
need the company to be successful and profitable.
Goal of the Project: Redesign RF towers to increase coverage area by 30% 
and reduce network coverage trouble tickets by 50%.
Scope Statement: The scope of this project is RF coverage and reduction 
in coverage network trouble tickets. The other network tickets are 
out of the scope of this project.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): This project goal is to reduce operation 
costs by 10%. These reduced operating costs will be accompanied by 
increased profits from an increase in customer satisfaction.
7.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.

7.2.2.3  Project Plan
The Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) methodology was 
used to apply the DFSS tools. As shown in Figure 7.3, IDDOV is established 
through a phase gate approach to technology development.
The five phases are as follows:
Phase 1: Identify the problem and develop the project charter.
Phase 2: Define the voice of the customer requirements.
Phase 3: Develop technology concept definition, stabilization, and func-
tional modeling.
Phase 4: Optimize the robustness of the subsystem technologies.
Phase 5: Certify the platform or subsystem technologies.
Each phase should be completed in sequential order. Each uses unique 
tools to establish the desired answer or result. If completed in sequence, the 
technique is very effective.
The project began with a discussion as to what the opportunities were for 
increasing the customer experience with their wireless handset. The conclu-
sion was to create a new RF tower design. This project will be completed using 
the IDDOV format. An analysis of customer needs, cost, and simplicity should 
all be considered in the project. This project will be completed with customer 
needs, design concepts, and modeling of robustness to derive the best pos-
sible solution. A Gantt chart was developed to ensure the team kept pace with 
the tasks required for the successful timely completion of the project.
The final Gantt chart is shown in Figure 7.4 and provides the 15-week pro-
gression of the project. The chart was created with the planned and actual 
timelines based on the preliminary and final estimates. The analysis of the 
chart shows that Phase 2 was the most time-consuming phase. The team 
followed the planned time very closely. The team estimated and concluded 
that the planning and inventing phase would take the longest. The team also 
found that each phase took a significantly different amount of time. The first

two phases were completed along with the schedule, while Phase 3 was com-
pleted ahead of schedule and Phase 4 needed an additional week to finish 
the project on time.
7.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for 
your project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?
7.3  Define Phase
7.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect VOC: Create a VOC survey to understand the current and 
potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
7.3.2  Define
In this project, the customers were already identified as wireless phone 
users making in-network calls. To obtain the voice of the customer (VOC), 
an online survey questionnaire was deployed to these customers, and 
92 customers responded. An online survey was used because of the low 

167
Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
cost and the convenience for the participant to take the survey on his or 
her own time.
Checklist: Market segment analysis by performing a market trend fore-
cast to address the question, “Is there something like this out on 
the market yet, and what is considered best in class?” In addition, 
benchmarking, gathering voice of the customer through a survey, 
affinity diagrams, quality function deployment, and Kano diagrams 
were utilized to ensure the team was heading in the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in market
•	 Gathering information on voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
7.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
To identify the needs of the customer, the team created an online survey 
designed to help us understand the most important factors to the customer. 
The responses to the survey are summarized as follows:
	
1.	Rating cell phone service:
•	 Reliability 78%
•	 Clarity 75%
•	 Texting 80%
•	 Caller ID 86%
•	 Voicemail 78%
	
2.	56% of respondents were not comfortable with having transmission 
towers near their residence.
	
3.	56% of respondents were concerned about the potential dangers of 
transmission towers.
	
4.	55% of respondents used their phones for less than 30 minutes in the 
morning. More people used their phones for less than 2 hours dur-
ing any part of the day.
	
5.	Respondents had sometimes experienced problems with text mes-
sages (sent failed 50%, delayed sent 50%, blocked numbers 12%).

168
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
	
6.	60% did not want to pay more even if the service was improved.
	
7.	Respondents had experienced dropped calls at the following rates: 
while driving 48%, during inclement weather 35%, and during spe-
cific times of the day 29%. However, most experienced dropped calls 
in amounts they considered acceptable.
	
8.	When asked an open-ended question on how service can be 
improved, 50 respondents provided an opinion as given below:
•	 18% wanted improved reception/clarity
•	 16% wanted cost to be lowered
•	 10% wanted wider coverage
•	 10% suggested that more transmission towers should be built
•	 8% wanted higher data speed
•	 6% wanted a reduction in dropped calls
Other opinions included having better phones and the freedom to choose their 
applications, but these were considered to be outside the scope of this project.
7.3.2.2  Structuring and Ranking Customer Needs
Considering all of the customer feedback and the statistical analysis, the 
team agreed by consensus that the ranked voice of the customer should be 
as follows (in order):
•	 Transmission towers, which are far from residences
•	 Transmission towers, which are safe and perceived so
•	 Brief but reliable morning call traffic
•	 Reliable text messaging
•	 Lower cost
•	 Reliable calls while driving
•	 Reliable calls during inclement weather
•	 Better call clarity
Once the feedback was analyzed, the importance of each need was ranked 
as shown in Figure 7.5.
7.3.2.3  Analysis of Competitors in the Market
After feedback was analyzed from the customers, the next step was to com-
pare the competitors in the marketplace. Information was gathered by driv-
ing around and comparing tower locations, as well as by talking to former 
employees of the competitors to study the various features. For benchmark-
ing purposes, the top three competitors were identified and the features 
were compared as shown in Figure 7.6.

7.3.2.4  Quality Function Deployment
The House of Quality (see Figure 7.7) was built based on the voice of the 
customer and the competitive analysis. There are four steps that are used in 
building this House of Quality:
	
1.	Develop a technical design requirement matrix based on the voice of 
the customer, and determine the relationship between the customer 
and engineering requirements.

7.3.2.5  Kano Analysis
The Kano analysis model is a customer satisfaction tool used to measure how 
well a product or service meets customer requirements. The goal is to try 
and prioritize customer requirements based on how certain attributes satisfy 
the customer. Based on the previous survey, the team attempted to generate 
10 customer satisfaction questions for the Kano analysis. The team talked to 
15 participants from three different regions (5 from Wisconsin, 5 from Illinois, 
and 5 from Missouri) who had taken the previous survey.
Using “Expected” for the basic services customers expect to receive, 
“Satisfied” for when the customers are satisfied with their current service, 
“Delighted” for when the customers did not expect to receive the service, and 
“Not Satisfied” for when the customers deem their service unacceptable. The 
results (see Figure 7.8) show that a majority of the test market did not approve 
of living near cell towers and reducing dropped calls would appeal to cus-
tomers. In addition, the participants were equally delighted and expected to 
receive better clarity. Finally, none of the participants wanted increased cost 
for service.

7.4.2  Design
After Phase 1, gathering all of the information from the field, the focus was to 
develop various designs for the transmission towers that may satisfy not only 
what the customers deem necessary, but also what aligns with the organization’s 
needs and constraints. Three concepts were designed for this project using three-
dimensional (3D) modeling programs and other advanced software programs.
Checklist: Concept generation technique (Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving [TRIZ], brainstorming), design for manufacture and assem-
bly, concept generation, affinity diagrams, Pugh concept evaluation 
and selection
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Generating several design concepts that meet customer require­
ments
•	 Evaluating superior concepts and superior technology to beat 
the market
•	 Analyzing and studying feasibility of superior concepts—looking 
at the competitors
•	 Adding value to the design by thinking “outside the box”
7.4.2.1  Concept 1
The first concept, shown in Figure 7.9, was sculpted around the customer’s 
concern for safety with no cost limit; however, cost was still considered in the 
use of materials not to exceed the network budget. This design is expected 

173
Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
to have only a 10% increase in cost of materials to build, but will be cheaper 
to maintain long term.
The monopole is made from a recycled metal and will have a cut along the 
sides 180° apart from each other to house a cable system that will be used to 
adjust the radio-frequency transmitter tube housing up and down the pole 
not only for engineers to have access to work on the transmitters, but also to 
allow for easier line-of-sight adjustment of the transmitters. Instead of hav-
ing access to inside the tower, all that is needed is a card reader and keypad 
on the outside of the tower to adjust the RF housing as needed.
The RF housing will be made of Plexiglass and will allow up to 20 RF trans-
mitters to be housed. By having more transmitters, the area of coverage can be 
increased. Plexiglas was chosen because it is a clear, nonreflective material that 
will not discolor with heat or ultraviolet (UV) light unlike polycarbonate. It is 
cheap to manufacture and can handle a higher amount of heat; however, to dis-
perse some of the heat four fans will be built into the tube to create air circula-
tion. Each transmitter will have a small window to allow for engineers to be able 
to work on each one individually and will be opened using the keypad.
7.4.2.2  Concept 2
The second concept, shown in Figure 7.10, was created to not only keep cost 
in mind, but to also tune into the safety concerns. This design is expected 
FIGURE 7.9
Concept 1.

174
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
to see a 15% drop in material costs, but because a previous structure will be 
used, maintenance may be needed in the future to keep the structure at a 
functional level.
For the pole, an old smokestack located near downtown will be used 
instead of a metal monopole. Inside, a spiral staircase will be used to reach 
the platform if any maintenance should be necessary on the RF transmit-
ters. A spiral staircase will also be used around the transmitters for easy 
access.
There will be four cones in a circular direction around the pole, each with 
three transmitters installed. This will give a circular transmission of radio 
waves. This pole will have three more transmitters than the current towers 
allowing for a larger radius of transmission.
7.4.2.3  Concept 3
The final concept, shown in Figure 7.11, was created to keep costs down and 
to keep a minimalistic design. The design is expected to see a 5% drop in 
material costs and will use the same monopole design as currently seen on 
RF towers.
There will be a polyhedral near the top of the pole to house the RF transmit-
ters. Sixteen of the sections in the housing will hold one transmitter. This will 
allow for more coverage than previously seen in current use of monopoles.
FIGURE 7.10
Concept 2.

175
Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
This design does not go above and beyond to cover the customer require-
ment of safety. It uses the same standards of current poles, where a technician 
is required to climb up the side of the pole or use a lift to reach the transmitters.

In this phase, the team reviewed the concepts to identify possible flaws 
and their effects and probable solutions on how to reduce them. The team 
also compared the influence of one factor on another and outside noise 
factors.
Checklist: Design of experiments, failure mode effect analysis, analy-
sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical 
parameter management
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors from both customers 
and competitors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors that influence one other
•	 Determining probable solutions to failure
7.5.2.1  Design for X (DFX)
Over 70% of a final product’s costs are determined during design (Boothroyd 
and Dewhurst, 2001). Because designs and redesigns involve expenses, most 
companies increase product cost to recover these expenses. For this proj-
ect, over 60% of the customers responding to the survey questionnaire had 
expressed that they were unwilling to pay more even if their services were 
improved. Additional cost constraints had also been put on the project. To 
ensure that expenses are kept at a minimum for the project, design for man-
ufacture and assembly (DFMA) methods will be incorporated. Studies have 
shown that companies that use DFMA methods early in product develop-
ment, on average, use less resources in product development and also have a 
shorter time to market.
Using the DFMA guidelines, there will be a deliberate effort on man-
ufacturability by making the product structure less complex. There will 
be a careful selection of materials with respect to cost over life cycle. 
In particular,
•	 These materials will be structurally appropriate and, if possible, 
locally available.
•	 Items such as transmission towers will be made shorter in length, 
where possible, to minimize the quantity of material used.
•	 At the system level, these towers will also be kept at a minimum.
•	 The number of parts including fasteners will be minimized to reduce 
assembly time and cost.

177
Design of Radio-Frequency Coverage for Wireless Communications
•	 Parts that are easy to handle and orient during assembly will be 
produced.
•	 Improvements will be quantified.
7.5.2.2  Modeling of Technology
The Functional Analysis System Technique (FAST) and Fault tree analysis 
(FTA) diagrams are used in this phase of the project. The FAST tree diagram, 
shown in Figure 7.12, is a model outlining the important functions and parts 
of the project. This helps ensure that everyone understands the product con-
cepts from a physical perspective.
The Fault tree diagram, shown in Figure 7.13, was used to show what noise 
factors or faults would adversely affect the project. It is used to help identify

what possible failures may occur to help improve robustness. It is also used 
as a tool to outline troubleshooting.
7.5.2.3  Modeling of Robustness
The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) was used to help analyze the 
potential failure modes within the system and the severity and likelihoods 
of the failures or defects. The FMEA is the best resource to use that requires 
minimum effort and cost.
The first step in developing the FMEA for the RF transmission tower was 
to brainstorm as a group the potential failures and rank the severity of the 
failure. As shown in Figures 7.14 and 7.15, the scores assigned for the possible 
failures are used to calculate the risk priority number (RPN), which is then 
used to determine the rank of severe failures.
7.5.2.4  System Additive Model
In order to provide a robust design, interactions between control factors and 
noise factors are characterized and quantified as they relate to the critical 
functional response (CFR). The parameter diagram (P-diagram), shown in 
Figure  7.16, provides the relationship between the parameters that would 
affect performance at a system level.
The signal factor in this project is the customer making contact with the tower 
when calling or sending a message by dialing. This factor is also dependent on 
the distance from the tower. Call traffic has been included in the noise factors 
because the team has determined this is a factor they cannot interfere with.
While functional models have not been made for this project, they must be 
made in the future to fully complete the project. The appropriate signal-to-
noise (S/N) ratios will be calculated from the CFR data. In addition, changes 
may need to be made to the critical parameters to improve the S/N values 
using design experiments.
The system additive model is generally given by

Upon choosing the first design with the recycled monopole and 20 RF

The final step is to create a set of controls to ensure that each tower will be 
built with the same guidelines. This will include the dimensions and speci-
fications that must be used in construction.
7.6.2.1  System Variance Model
The system variance model is part of the capability verification phase that 
tests the sensitivities of system tolerance. The system variance model con-
tributes to the parameters of the critical functional response. These results 
are documented within the system, subsystems, subassemblies, components, 
and manufacturing process.
In order to conduct a system variance model, the team would need to be 
able to test the product or service with a test market of consumers. Within 
this project, that information is not available, and conducting surveys 
would not be sufficient when trying to determine the system variance of 
the redesign of cell towers. This type of information would require a field 
test consisting of a prototype cell tower, cell phones, and consumers. This 
would enable the team to measure the various noises and tolerances. Due 
to the time and financial constraints, this was not performed during this 
case study.

7.7  Summary
In conclusion, the team successfully deployed the use of the IDDOV process 
within the DFSS methodology to design and develop a new RF transmis-
sion tower in the Denver, Colorado, area. By implementing the DFSS pro-
cess throughout the entire project, the team was able to develop a tower that 
could be assembled easier, is safer to work on, and gains more coverage area 
for customers. By using the FMEA, the team was able to become aware of 
the possible failures and was prepared with recommendations on how to 
remedy these issues.
The process was very tedious, and most of the time of the project was 
spent on the design phase of the project. The team was able to take an 
existing platform and build a new idea to meet the customer requirements. 
The tools that were used throughout the project and the gating system

in DFSS helped to ensure that almost no to minimal flaws were passed 
on to the next phase unnoticed, and if the flaws do make it to the next 
phase there is a process in place to rectify them before the product enters 
production. As a team, we were able to develop a new design for an RF 
transmission tower that will meet the customer requirements and provide 
improved customer satisfaction.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
8.1  Project Overview
8.1.1  Project Description
To develop the solar-heated jacket, given the product name “IJacket,” a 
specific methodology, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS), was used to optimize 
results. DFSS is a business and engineering analysis methodology that uses 
tools to introduce new technology, products, processes, and services to 
market. It places the focus up-front in the design or engineering process. 
The goal is to avoid manufacturing or service process problems using sys-
tems engineering techniques from the start. DFSS enables this by focus-
ing the team on understanding the voice of the customer (VOC) and the 
customer’s specific requirements that create detailed engineering speci-
fications. The end result is a robust solution that is optimized to reduce 
the impact of variation. The product or service, as a result, requires fewer 
adjustments and thus less money is spent correcting problems. The basic 
idea is to understand customer requirements before production to reduce 
costly corrective measures.
8.1.2  Project Description
Currently, there are several jackets that are heated using battery power 
providing extra warmth as well as a few that can charge portable elec-
tronic devices using solar power. The team’s idea was to create a jacket that 
incorporates both of these technologies while still satisfying the expected 
quality that a winter jacket should fulfill. To ensure the jacket would meet 
our target market’s demand, the team sought customer feedback to guide 
the process.

Solar-Heated Jacket—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
8.1.3  Project Goal
The goal of the project is to create a jacket that is capable of providing extra 
warmth through an interior heating system. It will also be able to provide 
power to various electronics such as cell phones, iPods, MP3 players, and 
possibly even larger devices, depending on the VOC. Our aim is to sell at 
a competitive price point comparable to other winter jackets. Ideally, the 
IJacket would sell for not much more than a normal winter jacket, making 
the additional features much more attractive to customers.
8.1.4  Requirements and Expectations
The IJacket will require flexible and durable solar panels that can be attached 
to the jacket. The solar panels will need to be weather resistant and capable 
of working in cold temperatures. We expect our customers to find the added 
technology of the jacket a major delight and key factor in differentiating our 
product in the market. The jacket should be able to provide constant heating 
and charging capabilities when in direct sunlight and store up to 3 hours of 
power when indoors.
8.1.5  Project Boundaries
•	 The IJacket will use existing technology.
•	 It will only be able to sustain heating and charging one device at the 
same time.
•	 The IJacket will primarily be geared toward outdoor enthusiasts 
ages 18 to 39.
8.2  Identify Phase Activities
It is recommended that students work in project teams of three to four stu-
dents throughout the DFSS case study.
	
1.	Develop Project Charter: Use the information provided in the Project 
Overview section to develop a project charter for the DFSS project.
	
2.	Perform Stakeholder Analysis: Perform a stakeholder analysis, iden-
tifying project stakeholders.
	
3.	Develop Project Plan: Develop your team’s project plan for the DFSS 
project.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
8.2.1  Identify Phase
8.2.1.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: IJacket
Project Overview: To design a solar-powered jacket with heated interior 
and a mobile power source.
Problem Statement: There is a recent influx of small electronics carried 
constantly by individuals in need of a power source. Included in this 
problem is the fact that many customers use small electronics in the 
outdoors and likely in cold environments. Heated jackets exist on a 
12 V system. However, a greener design using solar energy would be 
better for the customer. A different jacket exists with a small power 
source, but its fashion does not appeal to all possible customers. 
Our expectation is to make the jackets fashionable by incorporating 
colors and logos of sports teams. We will also include a means of 
charging small electronics and integrating a sound system for musi-
cal enjoyment.
Customer/Stakeholders: We expect the largest group of customers to 
be outdoor lovers and sports enthusiasts, or possibly even sports 
teams. The customers would also include those who are con-
stantly traveling.
Goal of the Project: Create a fashionable, green, and affordable solar-
powered jacket with all the bells and whistles.
Scope Statement: We will focus on reducing costs to make it more afford-
able while maintaining the green and fashionable concept.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Gain the majority of the market share by 
selling the jackets in the $200 price range.
8.2.1.2  Perform Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholder analysis was performed to identify the project stakeholders. 
The stakeholder analysis definition is shown in Figure 8.1.
8.2.1.3  Develop Project Plan
The IJacket project was managed by using a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart 
is a way to place an expected timeline on the team in order to ensure the 
project is finished on time. This ensures the product is out to market before 
the competition in order to gain market share. Although speed is impor-
tant, speed needs to be balanced with quality assurance measures. To 

189
Solar-Heated Jacket—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
accomplish this, we constructed gates at each phase that included using 
templates and checklists from the DFSS methodology. We also required 
the approval or counsel of a DFSS expert on each task before moving to the 
next task or phase. The general phases of the project followed the process 
of IDDOV (Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate).
8.2.1.4  Gantt Chart
The Gantt chart (shown in Figure 8.2) was simplified for ease of reading 
and brevity.
All the tasks listed in the Gantt chart were completed in series because 
of the gate requirements. However, many of the subtasks were completed 
in parallel by different individuals from the working team. Each individual 
then brought the completed subtask to a group meeting where the group 
reviewed and approved the work. Rapid and effective communication is par-
amount to successful project management. Each member of the team must 
understand his or her role on the team and the expected inputs that he or 
she must provide. The environment of our working group allowed for face-
to-face communication three to four times a week. The group also had other 
projects together, which enabled cross talk and periodic progress reports 
throughout the week. Our group has worked and socialized together before 
the IJacket project and continued the same group dynamic that produced 
previous success. Good communication enabled each member of the team to 
participate in any discussion and provide input on the project. Our methods 
of communication included face-to-face conversation, written correspon-
dence, and telephone conferences.

8.3.1  Define Phase
8.3.1.1  Collect Voice of the Customer (VOC) Information
To implement the voice of the customer into the design process, we con-
ducted a survey that was mainly targeted at our key demographic of 18- to 
39-year-old outdoor enthusiasts. Essentially, we wanted feedback from the 
population that would most likely have a need or desire for the IJacket. Some 
of the activities we saw our target market participating in were attending 
football games, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, and hunting.
Our survey was conducted online, consisted of nine questions, and was 
taken by 49 individuals. The respondents were given choices for most 

192
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
questions to help narrow the survey but were given an opportunity toward 
the end of the survey to identify any features they would desire on a jacket 
that were not included in the survey.
The key information derived from the survey is as follows:
•	 92% of our target audience was represented (i.e., outdoor enthusiasts).
•	 47% football spectators, 53% hunting, and 56% skiing/snowboard-
ing were the largest populations.
•	 67% wait 3 years or longer to buy a new jacket.
•	 The average temperature for household thermostats was centered 
between 68 and 70°F.
•	 35% showed a strong interest in the general concept for the IJacket 
with 73% neutral or better.
•	 Fit, comfort, and warmth were the most important features of the jacket.
•	 Team logos were undesirable to customers.
•	 67% want to pay less than $250 with the additional features.
•	 The respondents were willing to pay more for additional features.
•	 35% of those who responded to our write-in question stated that 
numerous/well-positioned pockets were a key feature of a jacket 
they would own.
After analyzing the raw customer data we developed some essential cus-
tomer requirements:
•	 Warm, comfortable, and fit well
•	 Lots of storage
•	 Integrate with iPods/MP3 players
•	 Cost less than $250
•	 Convertible (adapt to changes in temperatures)
•	 Durable
•	 Adjustable
Finally, we translated these requirements into functional requirements (FRs) 
that could satisfy customer requirements. Some of the important functional 
requirements were
•	 Solar-powered heating
•	 Numerous and secure pockets
•	 Earbud routing and iPod/MP3 storage compartments
•	 Removable layers

193
Solar-Heated Jacket—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
•	 Breathable fabric
•	 Moisture-controlling fabric
•	 Glove integration
8.3.1.2  Ranking Customer Requirements
After identifying the needs, we needed to next rank the customer require-
ments and identify their importance. Again, we took the VOC from our sur-
vey to understand the importance of each requirement, shown in Figure 8.3.
8.3.1.3  Identify Critical to Satisfaction (CTS) Measures and Targets
8.3.1.3.1  Market Analysis
Our next step was to analyze the competitors in our market against our cus-
tomer requirements as shown in Figure 8.4. We decided to benchmark our 
product against an existing battery-powered, solar-powered, and regular 
winter jacket. Thorough research was conducted to find jackets that were tar-
geting our current market and that were sold near our price point. The solar 
jacket was the only jacket that was slightly above our target price range, but 
currently it is the only solar-powered jacket on the market that we could find.
8.3.1.4  Translate Voice of the Customer (VOC) 
into Technical Requirements
8.3.1.4.1  Quality Function Deployment
Our next step was to use quality function deployment (QFD) to further refine 
the grouped VOC data. QFD uses the data to develop a clear, ranked set of 
product development requirements. The House of Quality (HOQ) tool was 
used as our primary tool for QFD. The HOQ transforms the VOC into tech-
nical and business performance requirements. It allows us to understand 
the correlations between our customer requirements and the functional 
requirements we developed. The HOQ will show us which requirements 
have strong relationships with each other and if we have missed fulfilling 
any customer requirements. It will also show us if we have incorporated 
a functional requirement that the customer does not desire. The House of 
Quality is shown in Figures 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7.
8.3.1.4.2  Functional Requirements Relationship (Top of House of Quality)
We next needed to understand the relationships between the functional 
requirements. Sometimes two functional requirements individually will 
make your product more robust, but the combination of the two can have a 
negative impact. For example in our HOQ, we found that increasing solar-
powered heating and the number of layers would both add to the comfort 
of the jacket. However, if both were increased, at a certain point it would 

194
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
make the jacket too hot and uncomfortable. Improving both at the same time 
can possibly reduce the comfort and thus reduce the customer satisfaction 
with the jacket. Through the HOQ we identified a number of relationships 
between the functional requirements that will be considered when develop-
ing concepts.
8.3.1.4.3  Functional Requirement Targets
Based on the VOC and the existing products in the market, we established 
target limits for each of the functional requirements. To facilitate design-
ing concepts we included the difficulty of each target, which was primarily 
based on the added cost that each requirement would add to the jacket.
8.3.1.4.4  Kano Analysis
To further understand the VOC, we next conducted a Kano analysis as 
shown in Figure 8.8. The Kano analysis breaks customer satisfaction into 
three categories: basic needs that must be in the future product, linear

satisfiers that produce proportional satisfaction with their increased pres-
ence in the future product, and delighters that the customer is satisfied with-
out but make the product exponentially more appealing. Understanding the 
customer requirements for the first two categories is extremely important in 
producing a product that customers would consider purchasing. The final 
category helps us understand the features that will distinguish our product 
and promote sales. We established these different categories based on the 
feedback from our survey and from customer needs defined by what they 
do; essentially analyzing the popular jackets people are currently buying.

1.	Identify design concepts. Develop the design concepts.
	
2.	Design the product and select the concepts.
8.4.1  Design Phase
8.4.1.1  Identify Design Concepts
8.4.1.1.1  Concept Generation
Concept 1: Our first concept was termed the “Cadillac” option because 
it would go above and beyond in all facets of quality and capabil-
ity. The concept is defined by having a strong heating and charg-
ing capability. Another distinctive feature is the ability to detach 
the solar cells from the jacket. In addition, the jacket would have a 
heated hood, thermostat heating control, iPod/MP3 integration with 
earbud routing up through the collar, thin and breathable material, 
lots of pockets, and be composed of multiple layers.
Concept 2: Our second concept was termed the “Extreme Conditions” 
option, because it would be appropriate for someone who enjoys 
activities such as mountain climbing where weather extremes are 
experienced. This concept is defined by having the most powerful 
Exciters (Delighters):
• Underarm vents
• Comfortable fabric
• Moisture control
• Tickness
• Removable layers
• Numerous pockets

solar cells in order to provide large amounts of heat. In addition, the 
jacket would incorporate glove integration, jacket–pants integration, 
thick and durable material, rotary heating control, an integrated face 
shield, and no iPod/MP3 integration.
Concept 3: Our third concept was termed the “Temperate/Moderate 
Conditions” option. It was intended to be made for climates where 
there is not a large swing in the weather conditions. This concept 
would have smaller solar cells, an on/off switch for heating, a non-
heating hood, limited pockets, and no electronic charging capability.
Concept 4: Our fourth concept was termed the “Athletic” option. This 
concept was designed for people who actively participate in sports. 
Some of the key features that define this concept are thin, breathable 
material, comfortable fabric, underarm vents, iPod/MP3 integration 
with earbud routing, smaller solar cells for less heating capability, 
rotary heating control, glove integration, and multiple layers.
Concept 5: Our fifth concept was termed the “Styled” option because 
it was meant for a consumer interested in appearing fashionable 
and trendy. Some of the key features that define this concept are 
a retractable hood, charging capability, iPod/MP3 integration with 
earbud routing, no heating capability, and multiple layers.
Concept 6: Our sixth concept was termed the “Convertible” option. This 
option was meant to exhibit versatility in its use and capabilities. 
Some features of this option include a retractable hood, underarm 
vents, multiple layers, numerous pockets, glove integration, moder-
ate solar heating, and limited charging capability.
Concept 7: Our seventh concept was termed the “Storage” option 
because it was intended to accommodate a customer who likes to 
carry lots of electronics. This option contains features such as strong 
charging capability, glove integration, limited heating capability, 
iPod/MP3 integration with earbud routing, and numerous pockets.
8.4.1.2  Design the Product: Select the Concept
8.4.1.2.1  Pugh’s Concept Selection
In order to begin this process, we started by defining the concept selection 
criteria to conduct our analysis. Due to the manageable amount of VOC 
requirements, we decided to use all of them when comparing our seven con-
cepts. The VOC requirements are listed in priority, as indicated by the results 
of our survey. Next, we chose a best-in-class datum to compare our concepts. 
We chose to use Competitor 1 from our competitive analysis in our House of 
Quality as the datum because it was the highest rated compared to our VOC. 
We then conducted our analysis of the seven concepts using the standard 
+ (better), S (same), – (worse) symbols to denote its comparison with the 

201
Solar-Heated Jacket—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
datum. We then compiled the results from the seven concepts, and the results 
are shown in Figure 8.9.
Our initial analysis of the results indicated the Cadillac option, Convertible 
option, and Storage option were the strongest options compared to the 
datum. We then compared the three options to see differences in the ratings. 
Many of the higher-ranked requirements shared the same rating among 
all three with the lower-ranked requirements showing the differences. We 
were able to further our concept using the price criterion. Our projections of 
price for these three concepts indicated we could meet the customer require-
ment for less than $250 with the Convertible option and the Storage option, 
but not the Cadillac option. We decided to form a hybrid option by making 
trade-offs using the voice of the customer and the price point we intended to 
meet. Our superior concept contains the following features and is pictured 
in Figure 8.10:
•	 Moderate-to-strong heating capability
•	 Moderate charging capability
•	 Multiple layers
•	 Glove integration
•	 iPod/MP3 integration with earbud routing
•	 Underarm vents
•	 Retractable, heated hood
•	 Numerous pockets (internal and external)
•	 Comfortable, breathable fabric
8.4.1.3  Design for X (DFX) Methods
Design for Producibility: We intend on using commercially available 
solar cells, because flexible solar cells capable of providing the 
needed amounts of voltage and wattage for small, personal electron-
ics already exist. Our base jacket production will be outsourced for 
cost purposes. We will control the flow of materials through efficient 
management of the supply chain. We will conduct testing to ascer-
tain the most efficient and safe way to connect the solar cell to the 
base jacket, which will be our primary role in production.
Design for Assembleability: Because our design will integrate solar cells 
and fabrics, we will assemble the finished product by hand. The flex-
ibility and soft form of the jacket will require a human to place the 
coils for the heating component at precise locations. Issues pertain-
ing to the number of fasteners to stabilize the heating elements in the 
jacket and the ease of these motions will be the most challenging but 
are capable of being overcome.

Solar-Heated Jacket—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
Design for Safety: Design for safety will be paramount in our design with 
the integration of the solar cells and the jacket material. Inherent in 
our design will be the treatment of the material that will interface 
with the coils of the heating element with a flame-resistant com-
pound. This coating will prevent the jacket from catching fire or melt-
ing on the skin. Our design also incorporates a safety on/off switch 
in the lower pocket to quickly disable the transmission of heat. This 
is in addition to our rotary control for normal heating regulation.
Design for Serviceability: The solar cells we are intending on using come 
with a 3-year warranty. However, upon entering into a contract with 
the supplier, the warranty may be adjusted given the use of them 
on a jacket, because there will be greater wear and tear on the solar 
cells than the manufacturer may have intended. Potential repair of 
broken solar cells should be easy to accomplish with the connection 
point to the jacket easy to access.

8.5  Optimize Phase Exercises
	
1.	Implement pilot process.
	
2.	Assess process capabilities.
	
3.	Optimize design.
8.5.1  Optimize Phase
To optimize the results of the data we obtained, we decided to form a small 
parameter diagram as shown in Figure 8.11. We quickly realized that solar 
energy cells would have the greatest impact on the optimization of the jacket. 
We needed the most valuable solar energy cell for our situation. The largest 
increase in efficiency would come from optimizing the solar cell because of 
the high cost of the solar cells and the variability of capabilities.
The customer requirements showed that we needed 12 V of power. This 
is the power we needed to warm the jacket and provide a charging function 
for iPod/MP3 integration simultaneously. Our investigation of solar cells 
determined the price of 12 V of power at approximately $80. Adding this 
solar cell would place the price of the jacket above the range desired from 
the VOC.
We decided to do a comparison of the solar cells we could locate on the 
market. We compared solar cells that varied greatly in terms of power and 
increased greatly in cost in terms of power. Larger solar cells cost more per 
voltage as voltage increased. None of the solar cells met all of the criteria. 
However, after more brainstorming and group discussion, we decided to 
compare the single solar cells against different combinations of smaller solar

cells. In this fashion, we successfully identified a combination of smaller 
solar cells working as separate systems that meet all the customer require-
ments and kept the total cost of the jacket in the desired range.
8.5.2  Optimize Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How would you define the design of experiment design to use?
	
2.	How would you determine which factors and levels were significant 
to your design?
	
3.	How would you determine the appropriate number of replications 
for your experiment?
8.6  Validate Phase Activities
	
1.	Validate process.
	
2.	Assess performance, failure modes, and risks.
	
3.	Iterate design and finalize.
8.6.1  Validate Phase
The verification of our hybrid super concept must address two key areas 
before it can be delivered for full production:
	
1. Ensure that the voice of the customer has been met with the final 
design.
	
2. Ensure the voice of the process is feasible with a high degree of 
consistency and aligns with the expectations of the voice of the 
customer.
In order to verify that our design meets the voice of the customer, we would 
propose to conduct a survey to assess the strength with which we met our 
customers’ needs. We would try to get all of the same respondents who filled 
out our initial survey to reply. Shown in Figure 8.12 is a sample of the areas 
we would ask to rate on our survey.
We expect the results of this survey to be very positive with averages 
greater than four. In addition to the survey, we showed our prototype to a 
few potential customers who are outdoor enthusiasts and would be potential 
customers for our jacket. Overall, the response to the jacket was very positive 
with one person remarking, “I would definitely buy this jacket if it were avail-
able today!” Therefore, we have successfully met the voice of the customer.

206
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
In the second step of verification, we will ensure the highest level of qual-
ity is provided with the finished product. We have a reliable and techno-
logically proficient supplier who can provide the solar cells and a reliable 
supplier for the base jacket. Our skills and knowledge in connecting the two 
to provide an actively warming and charging jacket have been established 
and proven with a high degree of success. Our product has been verified by 
both the customer and the process.

8.7  Conclusions
The process of developing a new product cannot be undertaken lightly. In 
order to bring a new product to market, there is a considerable amount of 
risk involved. Large amounts of capital can be infused into a project with 
the expectation of positive results. When anything other than those positive 
results occur, companies are left searching for answers to what went wrong.
DFSS provides a well-conceived methodology to follow in order to reduce 
and minimize the amount of risk in bringing a new product to market. The 
cost associated with developing new products can grow tremendously when 
work has to be redone. The DFSS methodology provides tools and best prac-
tices that can be used to limit these potential added costs. The breakdown 
of the DFSS methodology into phases allows for breaking up the risk into 
increments, so if something is not progressing with good results, the project 
can be put on hold or scrapped to minimize the loss. The gates are the points 
at which the incremental progress is evaluated, and a decision to continue 
pursuing the project can be made.
In our project, we were able to see this multiphase process in action. We 
came up with our idea, brought it to our customers to receive their input, and 
were able to develop a robust and optimized product that met our custom-
ers’ requirements. We successfully used the IDDOV process to develop this 
product for our customer. Throughout this whole process, we had a clear 
vision of what we wanted to accomplish, and we took a methodical approach 
to reaching it. In the end, we were successful because we kept our customer 
at the forefront of the process and managed the risks effectively.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
9.1  Project Overview
9.1.2  Project Description
For this project, the team applied the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) meth-
odology and tools to redesign the concept of a jewelry case to fit the mod-
ern woman’s needs while traveling long distances or through her everyday 
activities. The jewelry box would be designed to provide a convenient travel 
form that meets her needs for a reasonable price.
9.1.3  Project Goals
Our goal is to design a jewelry case that has the functional capability to carry 
not only jewelry in a safe and efficient manner but also other items the con-
temporary woman needs such as makeup, personal items, and even enter-
tainment items, such as an iPod/MP3 or other music player. Consideration 
to design form will be considered to make the product attractive fashionably, 
not just functionally. The goal is for women to replace their current jewelry 
storage products with the new product design. The voice of the customer 
(VOC) will be implemented to allow the product to attain its maximum 
value while using DFSS tools and principles in an effort to gain experience 
in the DFSS process.
9.1.4  Summary of Requirements and Expectations
	
1.	Allocate space for and organize jewelry in a manner that allows for 
items to be secured (no tangling) and safe from the rigors of travel.
	
2.	Provide a selection of features that distinguish this new jewelry box 
from other products on the market.
	
3.	Provide previous functions in a fashionable and attractive form.
	
4.	Accomplish the previous requirements in a cost-effective process.
	
5.	Note that the team expects to design a product that meets the cus-
tomers’ needs to an extent that they would be willing to replace their 
current methods of storing their jewelry while traveling.

9.2  Identify Phase Activities
It is recommended that students work in project teams of three to four stu-
dents throughout the DFSS case study.
	
1.	Develop Project Charter: Use the information provided in the Project 
Overview section to develop a project charter for the DFSS project.
	
2.	Perform Stakeholder Analysis: Perform stakeholder analysis, identify-
ing project stakeholders.
	
3.	Develop Project Plan: Develop your team’s project plan for the DFSS 
project.
9.2.1  Identify Phase
9.2.1.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Traveling Jewelry Box
Project Overview: In the market today, there are very few jewelry boxes 
that can be considered travel sized and/or reasonably priced. Our 
team plans to develop such a jewelry box that is appropriately sized 
for travel (to be determined), that organizes jewelry pieces in a safe 
environment, that is aesthetically pleasing, and that is considered 
affordable to the average market (to be determined).
Problem Statement: Our team will set out to create an innovative solution 
for men and women to be able to transport and have an easy way to 
display their jewelry without the risk of damaging, tangling, or losing 
any of the jewelry pieces. This solution will satisfy the needs of the 
customer because of its capabilities, and for aesthetics and financial 
concerns as well.
Customers/Stakeholders: Traveling men and women of all ages
Goal of the Project: Create an affordable travel-sized jewelry box.
Scope Statement: Due to a restraint in resources, we will focus on col-
lege women. To better understand their requirements, we will 
survey both the customer and the market to determine the best 
product design.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): The project will attempt to break into a new 
market segment for jewelry boxes. If the market is properly analyzed 
and the customer needs are met and/or exceeded, then as develop-
ers we should be profitable.

212
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Project Boundaries: Because the scope of the project is to create an eas-
ily portable jewelry case, size will be a constraint. The jewelry case 
will have space for only a limited number of items, but its ability to 
house different items will need to be flexible. Durable material will 
need to be used in its construction over previously used fabrics such 
as velvet. The cost of this jewelry box should be under $100 because 
it is portable and more likely to be lost than a permanent jewelry box 
that would sit in a woman’s bedroom.
9.2.1.2  Perform Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholder analysis was performed to identify the project stakeholders. 
The stakeholder analysis definition is shown in Figure 9.1.
The potential customer of the jewelry box would want a jewelry box that 
prevents breakage of the items and avoids tangling of necklaces and other 
jewelry. The jewelry box should be a reasonable price and be able to be used 
at home as well as when traveling. The project team is applying the DFSS 
tools and methodology. They desire to meet the customer requirements 
through the product design. The project champion, who is also the class 
instructor, wants to ensure that the teams learn and apply the DFSS tools 
and methodology, and also ensure that the customer requirements are met 
through the product design.
9.2.1.3  Develop Project Plan
A Gantt chart was used to keep the project development cycle on track 
and ensure that all key steps in the process were accomplished. This chart

includes dates and tasks that are essential for appropriate usage of time 
management during the scheduled period of work. The team used the 
Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) methodology.
9.2.1.3.1  Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate 
(IDDOV) Roadmap (Plan of Action)
To have a successful product that satisfies a wide array of the target market, 
project management is key. Using the IDDOV roadmap, the team devel-
oped a timeline that included all of the phases and intermediate gates, 
allowing for a check concluding that all requirements have been met up to 
that gate.
9.2.1.3.1.1  Phase/Gate 1—Identify  This phase is where the team developed 
the project charter, identified the stakeholders, and developed the project 
work plan.
9.2.1.3.1.2  Phase/Gate 2—Define  This phase was used to learn about what 
was currently on the market, and what a consumer looks for in a product 
of this type. Using a carefully constructed survey the voice of the customer 
was obtained.
Checklist: Gathering voice of the customer, market availability analysis, 
competitive benchmarking, Kano analysis, quality function deploy-
ment (QFD)
Scorecard requirements: Determine customer wants and needs using 
QFD and Kano analysis, translate survey results to numerical met-
rics, prioritize customer requirements
9.2.1.3.1.3  Phase/Gate 3—Design  This phase was used in the design of sev-
eral different concepts that met both customer requirements and manufac-
turing requirements. Each concept has different trade-offs that have to meet 
customer requirements or manufacturing trade-offs.
Checklist: Generate concepts using what is currently on the market com-
bined with data gathered from the voice of the customer. Use Pugh 
Concept Selection matrix to select the best elements of the concepts.
Scorecard requirements: Generate concepts that meet customer require-
ments, evaluate current designs and superior technologies, and ana-
lyze manufacturability of the product.
9.2.1.3.1.4  Phase/Gate 4—Optimization  This phase was used to determine 
the robustness of the process by examining possible problems and the effects 

214
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
of these problems. These potential problems will be reviewed to determine 
preemptive prevention procedures.
Checklist: Design failure mode and effects analysis
Scorecard requirements: Identify several potential failure modes, reduce 
risk priority number below a specified target.
9.2.1.3.1.5  Phase/Gate 5—Validate  This phase was used to take the project’s 
final design to the customer who then reviewed the prototype. Other evalu-
ations in the phase were conducted to test the manufacturability and the 
reliability of the product.
Checklist: Customer review, manufacturing capability studies, mean 
time to failure study
The project plan is shown in Figure 9.2. It shows the tasks, task durations, 
start and end dates, predecessors of each task, and the resources required to 
perform each task. The project started January 5 and finished April 28.
9.2.2  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective and 
be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example provided? 
How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team would develop their project plan and 
how they assigned resources to the tasks. How would the team 
determine estimated durations for the work activities?

2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
9.3.1  Define Phase
9.3.1.1  Collect Voice of the Customer (VOC)
The voice of the customer refers to a responsive and innovative process 
that captures and relays the requirements of the customer/consumer in the 
form of feedback to the manufacturer/retailer. The purpose of the VOC is 
to provide the customer with the best-quality product and/or service in its 
class.
The team collected the voice of the customer using a survey. This survey 
consisted of nine simple questions, some of which also allowed the cus-
tomers to make their own comments. The survey questions are shown in 
Figure 9.3.
Based on the availability and resources, our survey was distributed to 
college undergraduate and graduate women at the Missouri University of 
Science and Technology campus, Rolla, Missouri. The customers’ more cru-
cial needs of a traveling jewelry box were identified as follows:
•	 68% prefer a traveling case that carries more than jewelry.
•	 63% prefer brighter colors.
•	 63% prefer lots of storage.
•	 63% prefer to purchase such an item at a department store.
•	 58% prefer a case that is compact and easy to clean.
•	 58% prefer spending no more than $20 on such a case.
More information obtained from the survey suggested that 79% of the peo-
ple who responded to the survey wanted a traveling jewelry box that carried 
makeup and other day-to-day personal items. Also, the survey pointed out 
that the most likely reasons a traveling jewelry box would be replaced were 
if it broke, became too dirty, or did not possess adequate storage.
Therefore, based on the survey responses, our team identified the basic 
customer needs for our product. They are as follows:
•	 Aesthetically pleasing design and colors
•	 Traveling case that can carry more than jewelry, such as makeup
•	 Lots of storage
•	 Compact

217
Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
•	 Easy to clean
•	 Available for purchase at a department store
•	 Inexpensive
The group studied these responses further to determine more specific cus-
tomer needs, which are listed below:
FIGURE 9.3

218
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
•	 Compact outer shell
•	 Expandable compartments for lots of storage
•	 Robust design and less moving parts ensure reliability
•	 Compartments designed with an easy-to-clean material, such as plastic
•	 Affordable for college students
•	 Case appears attractive, perhaps with interchangeable shells to 
manipulate looks
•	 Case is safe for the user and for the items it holds
•	 See-through compartments or labeling capability
•	 Mirror for application
•	 Hard outer casing, but flexible to decrease damage
9.3.1.2  Identify Critical to Satisfaction (CTS) Measures and Targets
9.3.1.2.1  Competitive Benchmarking
In our research, the team discovered most store locations do not carry a 
specific traveling jewelry box. In most cases, customers are forced to purchase 
bulky caboodles or tackle boxes in order to safely separate their jewelry for 
travel. However, some Web sites do allow customers to purchase traveling 
jewelry accessories. The team’s extensive research regarding traveling 
jewelry cases among market competitors is shown in Figure 9.4.
9.3.1.3  Translate Voice of the Customer (VOC) into Technical Requirements
9.3.1.3.1  Quality Function Deployment
Originating in Japan, quality function deployment (QFD) is a systematic 
process to integrate customer requirements into every aspect of the design 
and delivery of products and services. QFD is a collection of matrices used 
to facilitate group discussions and decision making. The QFD matrices are 
constructed using affinity diagrams, brainstorming, decision matrices, and 
tree diagrams.
QFD can lead to many great discoveries, such as
•	 Better understanding of customer requirements
•	 Increased customer satisfaction
•	 Reduced time to market and lower development costs
•	 Structured integration of competitive benchmarking into the 
design process
•	 Increased ability to create innovative design solutions
•	 Enhanced capability to identify those specific design aspects that 
have the greatest overall impact on customer satisfaction

219
Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
•	 Better teamwork in cross-functional design teams
•	 Better documentation of key design solutions
QFD has two main approaches: the Four Phase Approach and the Matrix 
of Matrices, also known as the House of Quality (HOQ). Our group deter-
mined that the HOQ approach was the best fit for this project. The House of 
Quality is shown in Figure 9.5.
9.3.1.3.2  Discussion of House of Quality
Quality characteristics, also known as design requirements or “hows,” were 
brainstormed and analyzed by the team in a similar fashion. Based on the 
customer-demanded requirements, our group developed possible ways to 
satisfy needs and avoid any adverse reaction to our product. These “hows” 
are the measurable implementations used to ensure all anticipated customer 
requirements are met. Quality characteristics and rankings were based on 
educational assumptions and information gathered from the competitive 
analysis. The demanded quality portion was validated, prioritized, and

Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
benchmarked. The weight/importance for each of the 10 customer require-
ments was based on the number of customers who felt a traveling jewelry case 
should provide these requirements. Each requirement relating to the surveys 
was tallied based on the number of times it was mentioned in Question 4 
and Questions 6 through 9 of the survey. There were approximately 30 cus-
tomers who responded to the survey. The customer responses include cor-
relations between customer requirements as well. Figure 9.6 shows how the 
requirements were ranked. The rankings (weight/importance) can be found 
on the left-hand side of the House of Quality.
In the interrelation matrix (the center of the HOQ), our group compared 
each customer requirement to each quality characteristic and then deter-
mined the strength of each relationship and denoted that relationship with a 
symbol referenced in the HOQ’s legend. In the event of a strong relationship, 
a “Θ” was implemented in the corresponding box.
A moderate relationship was denoted as an “Ο,” and a weak relationship 
was denoted as “▴”. If no relationship exists, then the corresponding box is 
left blank.
The “roof” matrix of the HOQ is used to identify whether the technical 
requirements that characterize the product support or hinder one another. 
As in the interrelationship section, our group considered the pairings of 
the technical requirements and for each pairing asked: “Does improving 
one requirement cause deterioration or improvement in the other technical 
requirement?” In the event of deterioration, the correlation between each 
requirement is considered a negative correlation and is further analyzed to 
determine the strength of deterioration. In the event of improvement, the

correlation between each requirement is considered positive and is further 
analyzed to determine the strength of the improvement. Each correlation 
that exists is denoted with a symbol established in the HOQ’s legend. If no 
correlation exists, the correlation cell is left blank.
In the competitive analysis, our group researched and compared other 
items in the market similar to our jewelry case. The rankings among the three 
competitors and our product were analyzed solely based on research, edu-
cated opinions, and customer feedback. Although the analysis shows that our 
product should compare above most of the competitors, our product has some 
room for improvements. For instance, our case is not as compact as some of 
the other cases; however, in order for the case to provide a lot of storage space 
it needs to have a complementary outer casing. Another example could be 
the case’s safety features for the cargo. The inner case material is reliable and 
safe for common day-to-day items, but if the customer chooses something not 
expected, the material may not be the best fit. Next, our team prioritized the 
quality characteristics and the customer requirements with calculations that 
allowed the team to focus on the key requirements. Ultimately, by focusing 
on the requirements that had the greatest positive impact on the design, our 
group should be able to promote customer satisfaction as well as make our 
product more appealing to similar items in the market.
After the House of Quality was completed, our group was able to deter-
mine the importance of each quality characteristic. This ultimately helps 
determine which functional requirements our group should implement in 
order to increase customer satisfaction and product success. Based on the 
weight of importance, our group found that designing a case with minimal 
moving parts should be a priority for the safety of our users and reliability 
of our product. The next crucial requirement is having the primary casing 
material be either metal or plastic for durability and the ability to expand for 
the desired amount of storage. The requirements should be prioritized by the 
relative weight determined at the bottom of the HOQ. The requirement with 
the highest relative weight is the most critical, just as the requirement with 
the lowest rating should be the least critical. Our group will simply execute 
the functional requirements in descending order of relative weight. This is 
essentially how our group determined the product concepts.
9.3.1.4  Kano Analysis
The Kano model of customer satisfaction classifies product attributes based 
on how they are perceived by a customer and their effect on the customer’s 
satisfaction. These attributes are divided into three categories: basic needs, 
linear satisfier, and delighters. Basic needs include attributes that the cus-
tomer specifically requests. Linear satisfiers include attributes that are not 
specifically requested but are expected to be present. Delighters are attributes 
that are unknown to the customer but are pleasing to them once they are dis-
covered. The categories are shown in Figure 9.7.

223
Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
The Kano model for this product is shown in Figure 9.8. The delighters are the 
lock option, changeable style, storage options, and being personalizable. The 
satisfiers are able to carry more than jewelry, have a mirror, be cleanable, and 
be reasonably priced. The basic needs are that the jewelry box is durable, secure 
for travel, easy to transport, easy to use, and has online support for the product.
9.3.2  Define Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How did your team perform the VOC collection? How could the 
VOC collection be improved?
	
2.	Did your team create and distribute a customer survey, and if so, 
what is the appropriate statistical analysis to perform to identify the 
importance of the customers’ requirements?
	
3.	Did you perform a quality function deployment? How did you

9.4  Design Phase Activities
	
1.	Identify Design Concepts: Develop the design concepts.
	
2.	Design the Product and Select the Concepts
9.4.1  Design Phase
9.4.1.1  Identify Design Concepts
This phase was crucial to the entire project. The development of concepts 
was looked at in three ways: aesthetics, functionality, and cost constraints. 
With the collaboration of several different viewpoints, concepts were devel-
oped and redeveloped to meet customer satisfaction.
9.4.1.2  Concept Generation
Our concept generations were designed based solely on the customer’s 
requirements from the voice of the customer. The designs were then exam-
ined to identify which were able to be manufactured at a reasonable price 
(compared to the retail price) and which would go beyond satisfying as 
many customers needs and wants as possible.
Concept A (Expanding Jewelry Rack): Concept A is a box with several 
compartments including four miscellaneous compartments, a brace-
let roll, and four rolls for other jewelry. It also provides an expand-
ing mechanism that allows for necklaces to hang vertically when the 
case is open and allows for storage of the other jewelry below the 
scissor lift. The lift would be able to retract back into the edges of the 
case if necklaces were not needed and would lie back down in the 
middle compartments. The case would need to be laid flat for the lift 
to operate properly, otherwise the necklaces may tangle. Concept A 
is shown in Figure 9.9.
Concept B (Fold-Down Jewelry Case): Concept B is similar to Concept C, 
but it is much smaller in scale. It has a top compartment with hooks 
to hang the necklaces and place them into the pouch. It features a 
ring holder at the base and several compartments with a latched 
cover to secure them in place. This product would be a hard plastic 
or metal with velvet interior fabric and a cushioned leather exterior. 
Concept B is shown in Figure 9.10.
Concept C (Fold-out Flat Jewelry Case With Rearrangeable Compartments): 
Concept C would provide a fold-out layout case that would be laid 
flat for full viewing and access with editable walls and straps. There 
are several different wall sizes and other jewelry storage items 
that can be interchanged using powerful magnets in the casing. 

225
Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
This concept has two Plexiglass® covers that can hold all items in 
place and allow the customer to easily see what he or she has. The 
item can support several items besides jewelry. Concept C is shown 
in Figure 9.11.
Concept D (Hard-Shell Jewelry Box With Removable Tray): Concept D 
is a hard casing made out of antitarnish tin-coated steel. With a 
fastener to ensure the case securely shuts (possible key entry), 
this item is composed of a set of removable trays made out of 
felt-covered plastic allowing for easy cleanup. The two layers 
allow for different items to store: the top for jewelry and the bot-
tom for makeup and other toiletry items. Concept D is shown in 
Figure 9.12.
FIGURE 9.9
Concept A.

Concept B.

226
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Concept E (Vertical All Hanging Jewelry Case): Concept E is a flexible roll 
up and out design for easy transport whether in luggage or just car-
rying by hand. The back has several clear compartments and neck-
lace and bracelet snaps to ensure all items stay secure and untangled. 
The lining would provide compartmental pouches that would be 
accessible when rolled out and hung up but be storable when rolled 
up into the two semihard circular casings at the bottom of the roll-
out sheet. When rolled up to be stored away the case would resemble 
a cylindrical tube with carrying straps on the exterior shell. Concept 
E is shown in Figure 9.13.

Concept C.
FIGURE 9.12
Concept D.

227
Traveling Jewelry Box—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
Concept F (Stackable Jewelry Tray Box): Concept F provides stackable trays 
that snap together and would be secured, allowing for a custom-
izable size depending on the needs of the customer for that trip. 
Additional needs could be catered to by adding another tray to the 
case if, for example, the customer wanted to bring more jewelry or 
have a separate compartment for toiletries. The casing would be a 
hard shell with a rubberized coating. A mirror could be recessed 
into the case top, and a replacement tray or top could be purchased 
if the customer wanted an updated color or style or if damaged with-
out needing to repurchase the entire jewelry box. The price could be 
variable with a smaller basic starter box with optional feature trays 
being bought later on or incorporated in more expensive models. 
Compartments would not be rearrangeable in each tray, but material 
linings would be different for each type of tray used; for example, 
a felt lining would be used for jewelry trays while a rubber lining 
would be used for a makeup tray for easier cleaning after any spills. 
New trays could be purchased if the customer wants to be fashion-
able and change the shell coloring or design or even mix colors for a 
rainbow effect. Concept F is shown in Figure 9.14.
FIGURE 9.13
Concept E.

228
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Concept G (Clamshell Case with Two Separate Compartment Halves): 
Concept G provides a compact clamshell casing that would have 
pegs on one half to organize jewelry and compartments on the 
other side of the clamshell for storing more jewelry or makeup. 
This slimmer case would allow for easier portability at the expense 
of space. The sleek profile would be more stylish than older box-
style cases and be made of a hard plastic shell. Concept G is shown 
in Figure 9.15.

9.4.1.3  Design the Product: Select the Concept
9.4.1.3.1  Pugh’s Concept Selection
Our team created sketches to prove concepts of storing items in a jewelry 
case and the possible results that method would form. The team developed 
seven concepts, although a few are similar enough to have shorter expla-
nations. A Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix was developed to narrow the 
field on possible designs for our final product. Comparison was performed 
against a product from the HOQ benchmarking section. Although these 
concepts are the focus, certain aspects of the grading were partly evaluated 
by how the concept would result in a finished product, and the sketches 
help illustrate the point. The Pugh’s Concept Selection matrix is shown in 
Figure 9.16.
Out of the concepts compared, several did markedly better than others, 
especially when taking into account the importance of the selected criteria. 
The Stackable Jewelry Box showed the most promise in the score matrix 
and was picked to be the concept to design for our final product. The other 
concepts that scored well, such as the hard-shell jewelry box and the clam-
shell case scored high for similar reasons; therefore, the team decided not 
to combine them for a better product. Concept C, however, scored well with 
its rearrangeable magnetic compartment that is maybe something we keep 
on the back burner to use if we see the availability to use it within the 
stackable tray box design. The selected concept will be incorporated in a 
jewelry case similar to its sketch and will have the following features:
•	 The dimensions of the box will be a square 8″ × 8″.
•	 The variable height depends on the number of trays used but will 
start at a height of 8″ that consists of a top cover of 1″ height, two 
2″ trays (makeup and jewelry), and one 3″ (toiletries/miscellaneous 
storage) in the base model.
•	 The trays will be tailored for individual purposes.
•	 A tray designed for makeup will have a rubber inner lining that 
is easily cleanable from any spilled powders or liquids.
•	 The trays for jewelry will be lined with felt and cushioning to 
handle the delicate items.
•	 A toiletries tray would have compartments for items such as a 
toothbrush, clippers, contact solution, and so forth.
•	 An electronics tray would have special slots to charge stored 
items such as an iPod/MP3 with a cord that would connect 
to the back of the box for easy charging. The specialized tray 
would have built-in speakers to make it a musical jewelry box. 
This option would be an aftermarket add-on and would not be 
included in the initial purchase for cost pricing.

•	 Trays will stack upon each other and will seal to one another but 
have a button-latch system that will guarantee no trays will acci-
dentally separate during transportation or rough use.
•	 The outer shell will be made of a hard plastic that is coated in a rub-
berized finish.
•	 The exterior will be offered in a variety of colors and designs that 
can be mixed and matched for fashion appeal.
•	 A kids’ version could be offered with colorful characters that 
could be swapped around in order to create humorous patterns 
or effects.
9.4.1.4  Design for X Methods
The product development stage has been carefully examined by the design-
ers and the manufacturing engineers to ensure that the final design not only 
meets the customer’s criteria but also is reasonable for a manufacturer to 
produce it. This area along with others will be designated as the Design for 
X method. There are several areas in this method (those underscored will be 
examined for this product):
•	 Design for produceability (manufacturability)
•	 Design for assembly
•	 Design for reliability
•	 Design for serviceability (maintainable)
•	 Design for environment
•	 Design for testability (measurable functions)
In this section, our team examined several areas of what items will need to 
be produced and what items can be outsourced. Figure 9.17 includes a list of 
the predicted parts needed to produce a single product. As time progresses, 
many of the same operations will be used to innovate and continue progres-
sion toward customer satisfaction. Meetings with suppliers and production 
will be needed to ensure the success of the manufacturing of this product.
9.4.1.5  Design for Assembleability
When the design for manufacturability is examined, design for assemble-
ability should be aligned with it. This section will look at the product and 
its subsystems to determine the best way to assemble it and reduce variabil-
ity. In the design of this product, our team wanted to focus on keeping the 
product design simple and reducing part count to minimize assembly time.

9.5.1  Optimize Phase
In this phase, the team reviewed the selected superior concept to identify 
possible flaws and their effects and probable solutions on how to reduce 
them. The team also compared the influence of one factor on another and 
outside noise factors.
9.5.1.1  Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
A Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) was used to answer 
the question of “what if.” This system is in the design phase so an analysis 
to determine worst-case scenarios with failures of components can be used 
to adjust the design to turn the variables into constants. Our team has gath-
ered much of the data for the PFMEA based on what we know about similar 
systems and how they function and problems that may occur to similar 
components in the systems. We based the risk priority number (RPN) on our 
previous experience. Using the RPN number, the team can prioritize prob-
lem areas and make changes as needed. The PFMEA is shown in Figure 9.19.
This tool was useful for identifying problems that may occur during the 
manufacturing and assembly of this product. This tool can be modified 
and reevaluated when production is online and there is a better idea of 
problem areas.
9.5.2  Optimize Phase Case Discussion

was conducted with a picture, description, and small model to 21 collegiate 
women. The women surveyed were queried about how they felt our prod-
uct met their needs using a scale of (1 to 5) for six questions using a Likert 
scale of 1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, and 5 = strongly agree. The survey 
results are shown in Figure 9.20.
Further verification will need to be performed over the manufacturing 
of this product and the facilities’ ability to adhere to our design require-
ments. This step will have to be completed at a later date due to capital cost. 
However, a prototype was fabricated for display. The results are encouraging 
enough that we may have come close to our customers’ needs.

9.7  Conclusions
Working as a team, we were able to use the DFSS methodology to redesign 
the way women can carry their jewelry and other accessories to a better 
degree of satisfaction. We were able to gather their needs and create a prod-
uct that is variable in size and durable in nature while remaining attractive 
and organized. The ability for further business is designed into the product 
for later purchases for customization or feature. DFSS also allowed for con-
sideration to the manufacturing of the product and what specifications were 
needed to fulfill the customer requirements in the given boundaries set up 
by the team. While this is a lengthy process to go through, the benefit of pro-
viding a higher-quality product by design is tangible. We are prepared with 
the Design for Six Sigma methodology to satisfy the goals of our project and 
our customer requirements.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
10.1  Project Overview
The design of the existing optical computer mouse is redundant, and the 
aim of this project is to develop new designs implementing Design for 
Six Sigma (DFSS) principles for  improving  the existing  characteristics to 
arrive at a final model that is better in aesthetic value, design, and com-
patibility. In addition, ergonomics will be taken into account to arrive at a 
better-quality product. Design for manufacture (DFM) principles will also 
be implemented, thereby eliminating unwanted fasteners and parts for 
assembly. This will lead to the reduction in material and assembly costs and 
thereby  decrease  the overall cost of manufacture that  leads to improved 
profit levels. This product will cater to the needs of customers in the medium 
to high budget range.
The goal of the project is to reduce manufacturing cost by 10%, increase 
market share by 5%, and design an optical mouse with better aesthetic look, 
design, and compatibility. Reducing the number of fasteners will result in 
savings for the customers and also a sophisticated design. The data were col-
lected from the potential customers of the product by distributing a survey 
to different categories of people. According to the data obtained and ana-
lyzed, the voice of the customer (VOC) was implemented in the product. The 
team also focused on designing the product to reach its maximum capacity 
and functions using DFSS principles.
The objectives of the project are to (1) apply the DFSS concepts to modify 
the design of an existing optical computer mouse; (2) improve the exist-
ing characteristics to arrive at a final model that is better in aesthetic value, 
design, and compatibility; (3) improve the ergonomics of the product; and 
(4) implement design for X (DFX) principles and reduce the material and 
assembly costs.
This project will focus on developing an optical mouse. Concepts and 
designs generated will be evaluated in order to determine the best design 
and create a model to demonstrate its usefulness. In order to optimize the 
model, experiments will be discussed but not conducted due to time and 
resource constraints.

designs by implementing DFSS principles for improving the exist-
ing characteristics to arrive at a final model that is better in aes-
thetic value, design, and compatibility. Ergonomics will be taken 
into account to arrive at a better-quality product. Design for 
manufacture (DFM) principles will also be implemented, thereby 
eliminating unwanted fasteners and parts for assembly. This will 
lead to the reduction in material and assembly costs and thereby 
decrease the overall cost of manufacture, leading to improved 
profit levels.
Customer/Stakeholders: All computer users
Goal of the Project: Reduction in manufacturing cost by 10%
Scope Statement: This product will cater to the needs of customers in the 
medium to high budget range.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Increase market share by 5%

242
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
10.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.
10.2.2.3  Project Plan
Once the idea was established (invent), a customer survey was developed 
and deployed in order to receive the specifications via the voice of the cus-
tomer. The Gantt chart shows the phases of the project from start to finish, 
noting that the phases were not completed in parallel but instead in series; 
however, some of the phase subtasks were able to be completed in parallel. 
The phases of the project were Identify, Define, Design, Optimize, and Validate 
(IDDOV). Checklists were used as gates to each of the phases, and score-
cards were maintained. During the Optimize and Validate phases, the score-
cards were useful in determining which phases could be revisited in order 
to further optimize the IDDOV process.
IDDOV uses a phase/gate approach to develop the technology associated 
with a particular product development. It is divided into five phases. At 
the end of each phase the team reached a gate where the deliverables were 
checked to account for the achievements in the respective phases. Various 
checklists and scorecards can be built based on PERT or Gantt charts. A 
Gantt chart was developed to specify the time line for each task and ensure 
that the current tasks were being carried out in accordance with the planned 
schedule as shown in Figure 10.1.
10.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.

243
Design of an Optical Mouse—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your 
project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?
10.3  Define Phase
10.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect VOC: Create a VOC survey to understand the current and 
potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
FIGURE 10.1
Project Gantt chart.

244
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
10.3.2  Define
The team started the commercialization process mainly by obtaining
	
1.	The voice of the customer
	
2.	The voice of technology
The voice of the customer (VOC) has to be utilized to develop the product 
in line with customer needs and requirements. To define the product line 
strategies and family plans, additional VOC can be obtained to target vari-
ous market segments. The product may need modifications or additional 
features depending on the market segment under target. Using VOC and 
voice of technology (VOT), technology houses of quality can be developed to 
build a foundation on which the entire plan can be developed. The technol-
ogy House of Quality can be used to benchmark criticality and priorities in 
technology needs. Both quantitative as well as qualitative approaches were 
carried out in order to elicit the VOC. An online survey was the primary 
source for quantitative analysis, while conversations with potential custom-
ers were the source for qualitative analysis.
Checklist: Market segment analysis by interviewing customers and per-
forming a market trend forecast to address the question, “Is there 
something like this out on the market yet?” In addition, bench-
marking, gathering voice of the customer through a survey, affinity 
diagrams, quality function deployment (QFD), and Kano diagrams 
were utilized to ensure the team was heading in the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information on voice of the customer through an online 
survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing the House of Quality
10.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
In order to identify the needs of the customer, a survey consisting of essential 
questions was created. This survey was circulated among various communi-
ties. The team received 58 survey responses from the participants with a vari-
ety of backgrounds of which half are students and the other half employed.

According to the responses from the participants, these were the expecta-
tions and preferences:
57.1% preferred wireless
72.7% preferred just about the size of the palm
75.4% preferred a two-button clicker
66.1% were ready to invest <$20 for additional features
The other set of information obtained from the survey was that 73.6% 
expected more comfort, 52.8% design/aesthetics, 47.2% size, and 45.3% size 
of the mouse while buying one. Further key statistics include the following:
•	 Type: 29% prefer a wired mouse, 57.9% wireless, and the rest do not 
want to use a mouse
•	 Size: 1.8% bigger than the palm, 25% smaller, and 73.2% just about 
the size of the palm
•	 Clicker: 24% single clicker and 76% double clicker
•	 The majority (over 60%) of the participants carry the mouse less than 
10% of the time they travel.
•	 67% of the participants experienced discomfort while using the 
mouse for long hours.
Hence, based on these results the team identified the basic customer needs 
for our product as follows:
•	 Wireless
•	 About the size of the palm
•	 Two-button clicker
•	 Comfort
•	 Aesthetic appeal
•	 Economical
The responses given by the customers are given in Figure 10.2.
A majority of the respondents carry the mouse less than 10% of the time 
when traveling. In addition, 67% of the participants complained of expe-
riencing discomfort while using the mouse for long hours. Hence, the 
team also concentrated on the aesthetics and comfort level while using 
the mouse.
Based on the requirements and the voice of the customer, the team rated 
the specified features and their significance in the design (see Figure 10.3).

10.3.2.3  Analysis of Competitors in the Market
The leading competitors in the market were determined to compare against 
our product, and the features for their products were ranked based upon the 
Web research and face-to-face interactions with the current customers. Then 
a competitor benchmarking was performed by comparing the proposed 
product with those five competitors. The ratings given for customer-speci-
fied features for a specific brand are listed in Figure 10.4.
From the competitor benchmarking it was observed that the highest rating 
was given to Mouse D. Hence, it was considered as our datum mouse.

commercialization of the process during product design. The team defined 
the results in three categories: new needs, unique needs, and difficult to ful-
fill needs. From this information the team created the House of Quality.
The process known as quality function deployment (QFD) is commonly 
used to help further refine the VOC. Data from the VOC are mapped using 
the KJ model to know the requirements of the customer and determine the 
measures of performance. QFD produces a two-dimensional matrix called 
House of Quality. HOQ is a system used to transform data from the VOC 
into technical and performance requirements for the new product.
Using the voice of the customer the team built the House of Quality (see 
Figure 10.5). These are the steps the team used to build the HOQ:
Step 1: List the customer requirements.
Step 2: List the technical descriptors (characteristics that will affect more 
than one of the customer requirements, in development or production).
Step 3: Compare the two (customer requirements to technical descrip-
tors) and determine relationships.
Step 4: Develop the positive and negative interrelated attributes and 
identify “trade-offs.”
The team analyzed the present market to find probable competitors who 
are working on or possess the current technology the team planned to imple-
ment in the design. When this was done, the key potential competitors were 
Logitech and Apple. There is a separate section in the HOQ where the trade-
offs are marked and documented. This section in the HOQ helped the team 
with the initial identification of DFSS requirements. The competitive bench-
marking showed the team what the customer expected that was not met by 
the current competitors, thereby surpassing them with the proposed design.

10.3.2.5  Kano Analysis
When conducting a Kano model the team must focus on customer satisfac-
tion while fulfilling basic needs of the product and expected quality. The 
successfulness of the product was determined by the results obtained from 
the Kano customer satisfaction survey. The delighter that excited most of 
the customers was the avoidance of discomfort by the current design when 
the mouse is extensively used for long hours. The survey yielded positive 
results of customer’s investment for additional features. However, the model 
has been designed to provide more additional features for the same price, 
another delighter. The option of easy assembly and disassembly of the prod-
uct excited the customer and would be a strong selling point, also enabling 
the customer to gain functionality of the product. The other delighters that 
the team considered and that resulted from the survey were the usage com-
patibility of the optical mouse on all possible surfaces and the single button 
with a double clicker. Figure 10.6 shows the Kano analysis.

10.4  Design Phase
10.4.1  Design Phase Activities
	
1.	 Identify process elements.
	
2.	 Design process.
	
3.	 Identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
10.4.2  Design
This is the main phase of the technology development and modeling. Concepts 
have to be evaluated to determine if they satisfy all key requirements based 
on the technological concepts. Different design concepts in accordance with 
the customer requirements were developed in this phase and evaluated.
Checklist: Concept generation technique (Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving [TRIZ], brainstorming), design for manufacture and assem-
bly, concept generation, affinity diagrams, Pugh concept evaluation 
and selection
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Generating seven design concepts that meet customer requirements
•	 Evaluating superior concepts and superior technology to beat 
the market
•	 Analyzing and studying feasibility of superior concepts—look-
ing at the competitors
•	 Adding value to the design by thinking “outside the box”
Concept 1—Wired to Wireless (see Figure 10.7): A radio-frequency (RF) 
transmitter will be integrated in the mouse which will record the 
mouse movements and clicks, and then send them as RF signals to 
FIGURE 10.7
Design Concept 1.

251
Design of an Optical Mouse—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
the RF receiver. The RF receiver receives these RF signals, decodes 
them, and then sends these signals directly to the computer. 802.11b 
or 802.11g radio frequencies operating at 2.4 GHz will be used for the 
data transmission. Automatic pairing of the receiver and transmitter 
will take place, thereby eliminating the interference issue.
Concept 2—Elimination of Fasteners, Ergonomics (see Figure 10.8): In this 
concept, fasteners were substituted with hinges to reduce the cost 
of manufacturing, assembly time, and ease of design. Also, the 
design is modified to an ergonomic arc design, thereby decreas-
ing the material required for manufacturing and improving the 
aesthetics of the product. Also, the reason for changing the design 
to an arc design is to eliminate carpal tunnel syndrome caused due 
to usage of the mouse for extended hours. This syndrome creates 
pain in the index and middle fingers and in the wrist because of 
the way of handling the mouse. At a resting position the human 
palm rests in an arc position, and the arc design fits well under the 
palm of the user eliminating this syndrome, hence it was taken 
into consideration.
Concept 3—Monoclicker Concept (see Figure 10.9): The clicker design 
has been modified such that there is a monoclicker now rather than 
two separate clickers for the left and the right. There has been a 
pivotal support that has been provided for the center of the mono-
clicker to rest on, thus eliminating the time required to assemble 
the second clicker.
Concept 4—Ball Scroller (see Figure 10.10): Here the team introduced the 
concept of a “trackball” instead of a regular scroller. A trackball con-
sists of a ball that is supported within the housing and is permitted 
Ergonomic arc design
FIGURE 10.8
Design Concept 2.

252
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
to rotate in the housing. The ball protrudes through the top of the 
housing so that the user can supply motive force directly to the ball 
at the point of protrusion. In operation, the cursor is moved to a 
desired location on the screen through movement of a rollerball by 
the user, and a specific function is then selected by pressing one or 
more keys on the control device. Rotation of the ball by the user is 
transferred into two orthogonal directions such as X and Y coordi-
nate directions to move the pointer on the computer screen in the X 
and Y directions.
	
	 This ergonomically friendly mouse is shaped to help avoid strain 
on the hands and fingers and help prevent  carpal tunnel syn-
drome  and other repetitive strain injuries. Trackballs have been 
proven to relieve wrist and hand strain that leads to carpal tunnel 
syndrome.
Concept 5—Laser Mouse (see Figure 10.11): After introducing the track-
ball and proposing designs that concentrated on aesthetics, the focus 
was on improving efficiency and precision of working, thereby 
introducing the concept of a laser. This concept uses a laser diode 
instead of a light-emitting diode (LED) to reflect the light off a sur-
face, and then compare the images taken by the CMOS sensor, to 
determine the displacement from the original position. The coherent

nature of laser light creates patterns of high contrast when its light is 
reflected from a surface. The pattern appearing on the sensor reveals 
the details on any surface, even glossy surfaces that would look com-
pletely uniform when exposed to the LED incoherent illumination.
	
	 While an optical mouse offers a resolution of 800 dots per inch 
(DPI), replacing the LED with a laser increases the DPI to approxi-
mately 2000. The increased resolution translates to greater precision. 
Rather than producing a continual light beam, laser mice observe a 
standby or sleep mode in which the light dims when not in use and 
returns to full power when moved.
Concept 6—Plug Point Charger (see Figure  10.12): Making the mouse 
wireless involved directing its power supply to a rechargeable bat-
tery system for more convenience. The concept of a plug point at the 
bottom shell of the mouse was introduced. The battery located at the 
bottom of the mouse can be easily charged by plugging in the mouse 
to any electrical wall outlet. Trickle charging will be used so as to 
avoid overcharging or damaging the battery.
Concept 7—Touch-Sensitive Scroller: Remote Mouse (see Figure 10.13): This 
design concept will feature a touch-sensitive scroll panel. A swipe

of the finger across the surface enables the inertial scrolling mecha-
nism, which adjusts its speed according to the speed of the finger 
swipe. The ratchet-scrolling mechanism retracts so the wheel can 
spin with virtually no friction.
	
	 Free space motion control technology is designed to provide accu-
rate, responsive navigation. This technology is based on a combination 
of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, digital signal 
processing (DSP) technology, and radio-frequency (RF) wireless tech-
nology that will allow a user to hold the mouse in any orientation, 
point in any direction, and enjoy effortless, intuitive cursor control.
10.4.2.1  Pugh’s Concept Selection
The seven different concepts were developed as described above, and Pugh’s 
Concept Selection matrix was used to compare the concepts and determine 
the best fit. Figure  10.14 shows a simplistic illustration of Pugh’s Concept 
Selection matrix used to assist in selecting the best design.
From the developed concepts the team developed two hybrid design con-
cepts. Hybrid Concept 1 includes the features of Concepts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
Hybrid Concept 2 includes the features from Concepts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. 
Therefore, the selected concepts have the following features:
Hybrid Concept 1:
•	 Wireless
•	 Elimination of fasteners
•	 Modified clicker design
•	 Trackball concept
•	 Laser
•	 Plug point charger

and ease of assembly (see Figure 10.15). It is referred to as “THE ARC” for its 
shape completely resembles an arc.
Key advantages of this mouse include
	
1.	The arc shape aids the customer in getting the proper grip. The arc 
shape is comfortable from an ergonomic point of view as the palm 
gets less fatigued with prolonged use.
	
2.	It is lightweight making it the lowest of all the design concepts.
	
3.	Much of the material has been removed as compared to the conven-
tional mouse. Hence, less cost is incurred in manufacturing model.
	
4.	The area of the mouse that moves over the pad or flat surface laser 
light area is quite less. Hence, the mouse can be easily moved due to 
lower contact area between the mouse and the pad.

10.5.2  Optimize
This phase optimizes the robustness of the technology under noise fac-
tors demanding more investment. Here, the design concept is finalized and 
reviewed. In addition, the influences of the factors on one another are com-
pared and possible flaws are identified and analyzed.
Next, the noise factor diagram is created to understand the flow of noise. 
Noise factors such as external noise factors, deterioration noise factors, and 
unit-to-unit noise factors must be determined, and their effect is traced in the 
form of the output noise factor. Noise factor experiments have to be conducted 
to study the magnitude and directional effect on the output. A FMEA can be 
used to identify and screen noise factors. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) can 
be used to determine which noise factors are statistically significant. The 
results of the noise factor experiments can be used to understand how the 
noise factor effects can be optimized. Control factors that interact with the 
noise factors are good candidates to help reduce the sensitivity due to noise. 
Depending on the type of interaction (moderate, strong, weak, etc.) between 
control factors and noise factors, various control factors can act as robustisiz-
ing factors, adjustment factors, or economic factors.
Checklist: Design of experiments, failure mode effect analysis, analy-
sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical 
parameter management
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors from both customers 
and competitors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors that influence each other
•	 Determining probable solutions to failure
10.5.2.1  Design for X (DFX)
In the design for X methods, all of the design concepts were evaluated 
based upon the tools required for assembling the final product and the time 
taken in each concept to complete the assembling process (see Figures 10.16 
through 10.19).
10.5.2.2  P-Diagram
The basic noise factors that interfere with the functioning of the device are 
described in the parameter chart. To avoid these noise factors during design, 
certain control factors are considered to improve the performance of the 
product as shown in Figure 10.20.

consequences, and their severity were determined by the failure mode effect 
analysis (FMEA) diagram as shown in Figure 10.22. Based upon this analysis 
the risk priority number (RPN) for each possible failure is calculated. From 
the usage of FMEA, considering the RPN factor, the team prioritized the pos-
sible potential failures to design a more efficient product.
From the FMEA analysis the design failures were prevented and solutions 
were found for the unavoidable failure modes.
In the verify phase, a prototype was created and was kept for customer 
evaluation. When compared with the basic model, customer satisfaction 
increased to 55% and the team was highly satisfied with the features of the 
product design. The statistics are given in Figure 10.23.

10.7  Summary
Design for Six Sigma principles were used for the successful completion of 
the project. The basic project requirements were described through the use 
of VOC and VOT. Initially, several concepts were designed, and later all of 
the concepts were combined to finalize two hybrid concepts. The House of 
Quality was developed to ensure that the team’s activity is in accordance 
with the voice of the customer.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
As a design team, implementing the DFSS principles to the product design 
enabled a savings of 26.5 seconds of assembly time per part, which is approx-
imately 36% time saved per part. The design and the comfort levels of the 
product were increased along with its functional performance.
Thus, through the application of the DFSS methodology, a hybrid optical 
mouse was designed with minimal production failures and elimination of 
functional disorders. The product was designed per the customer require-
ments and was commercially viable with a nominal price. At the end of the 
process, the team was able to meet the project goals and the product was in 
line with the customer requirements from the surveys conducted.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
11.1  Project Overview
Current duffel bags on the market contain the odor and moisture of the 
clothes stored within the bag so that it cannot escape the duffel bag and con-
taminates the surrounding area. Moisture leaks through the bag onto seats 
and other absorbent materials. Odor permeates the duffel bag and dissipates 
into the surrounding area such as your car or locker.
The Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) team will examine and recommend 
changes to the major process steps for the use of a duffel bag to decrease the 
odor and moisture of fitness gear stored in it. The investigation is limited to 
the moisture and odor absorption functions of the duffel bags.
The goal for the Design for Six Sigma team is to develop a duffel bag for 
people to store their wet and dirty clothes in, after they conduct physical fit-
ness activities, that absorbs and dissipates the odor and moisture from the 
clothes. With all these features the bag should be cost effective using avail-
able technology. The proposed cost range is $20 to $40. The goal is to reduce 
moisture and odor of fitness clothes by 75%.
The requirements and expectations are to design the duffel bag based on 
voice of the customer (VOC) and use the DFSS methodology. The use of DFSS 
will result in a more efficient and organized design process.

11.2.2  Identify
11.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step is to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Odor- and moisture-free duffel
Project Overview: The goal for the Design for Six Sigma team is to 
develop a duffel bag for people to store their wet and dirty clothes 
in after they conduct physical fitness activities that absorbs and dis-
sipates the odor and moisture from the clothes.
Problem Statement: Current duffel bags on the market contain the odor 
and moisture of the clothes stored within so that it cannot escape the 
duffel bag and contaminates the surrounding area. Moisture leaks 
through the bag onto seats and other absorbent materials. Odor per-
meates the duffel bag and dissipates into the surrounding area such 
as your car or locker.
Customer/Stakeholders: Fitness personnel, military personnel, manual 
labor professionals. What is important to these customers is the 
need to store fitness apparel that does not release moisture or odor 
to the surrounding area (i.e., car, locker, office).
Goal of the Project: Reduce moisture and odor of fitness clothes by 75%.
Scope Statement: The Design for Six Sigma team will examine and rec-
ommend changes to the major process steps for the use of a duffel 
bag to decrease the odor and moisture of fitness gear stored in it. The 
investigation is limited to the moisture and odor absorption func-
tions of the duffel bags.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Based on an operating budget of $50, this 
project will attempt to avoid costs connected with cleaner costs in 
the region and disposal of moldy clothes.
11.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Everyone is responsible for the success of the project.
•	 Listen to everyone’s ideas.

268
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
•	 Treat everyone with respect.
•	 Contribute fully and actively participate.
•	 Be on time and prepared for meetings.
•	 Make decisions by consensus.
•	 Keep an open mind and appreciate other points of view.
•	 Communicate openly.
•	 Share your knowledge, experience, and time.
•	 Identify a backup resource to complete tasks when not available.
11.2.2.3  Project Plan
A Gantt chart was used to keep the project development cycle on track 
and ensure that all key steps in the process were accomplished as shown 
in Figure 11.1. This chart includes dates and tasks that are essential for 
appropriate usage of time management during the scheduled period of 
work.
11.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the problem 
statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? Rewrite 
the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for 
your project?

2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?
11.3  Define Phase
11.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Collect VOC: Create a VOC survey to understand the current and 
potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Using the CTS measures 
and targets, identify the technical requirements for the product.
11.3.2  Define
In this phase, the aim was to research the duffel bag market and gather 
customer requirements to capture the voice of the customer (VOC) through 
the use of an online survey. The survey was sent out to over one hundred 
people, and 69 responses were received ranging from every type of person 
who might use a duffel bag. These needs were then translated to useful met-
rics, prioritized, and evaluated to obtain a clear understanding of customer 
requirements and to help in the initial design of the bag.
Checklist: Market segment analysis by visiting local sports stores and 
performing a market trend forecast to address the question, “Is there 
something like this out on the market yet?” In addition, benchmark-
ing, gathering voice of the customer through survey, KJ analysis, 
quality function deployment (QFD), and Kano diagrams were uti-
lized to ensure the team was heading in the right direction.
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Studying the market forecast
•	 Benchmarking our product to others available in the market
•	 Gathering information of voice of the customer through an 
online survey
•	 Translating customer needs to useful metrics and ranking them 
through building our House of Quality

270
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
•	 Prioritizing customer requirements based on survey results
•	 Performing Kano analysis
•	 Completing House of Quality
11.3.2.1  Identifying “Voice of the Customer”
In order to identify the needs of the customer, the team created a survey 
designed to help us understand the most important factors to the NODOR 
bag. The team developed this survey with the customer in mind, from those 
who would use this device regularly to those who would be able to purchase 
but did not have any experience in purchasing a product similar to ours in 
the past. The majority of customers we targeted were those who have some 
previous duffel bag purchasing experience. The greatest needs of the cus-
tomer have been identified as
•	 62% people preferred a medium-sized bag.
•	 42% people preferred a bag that weighs less than 2 lbs (before clothes).
•	 70% people would pay between $30 and $35 for this bag.
•	 67% people would store the bag in their car.
•	 67% people would use the bag at the gym.
•	 67% people prefer a shoulder-carried bag.
The results of our survey (see Figure 11.2) led the team to develop different 
models based on a customer who prefers a medium bag, which he or she 
would like to use three to five times weekly at the gym and store in a vehicle, 
and for these requirements pay between $30 and $35.
11.3.2.2  Structuring and Ranking Customer Needs
After identifying all the wants and needs of the customer, we ranked and 
sorted them to realize the most important and critical needs as shown in 
Figure 11.3.
11.3.2.3  Analysis of Competitors in the Market
The next step was to identify our competition. Our product is semi-inno-
vative; therefore, the process of identification was twofold. First, the team 
searched out duffel competition and then moisture wicking and defeating 
technologies. The team visited several sporting goods stores and analyzed 
different types of duffel bags ranging in price, size, and quality. Next, the 

271
Design of a Duffel Bag—A Design for Six Sigma Case Study
team compared materials such as dry-fit, mesh, baking soda bags, and 
other technologies that may compete against it. There were only a few com-
petitors the team believed would be competing for market space after our 
innovative entry.
*No direct comparison was available due to usage of varying technologies.

11.3.2.4  Quality Function Deployment
What we wanted to do—Transform the VOC into engineering character-
istics by prioritizing each product characteristic and all the while 
setting development goals for the entire product.
How we did it—(rank relationships) (i.e., each “must have” analyzed to 
ensure accomplished, then backwards plan to achieve manufactur-
ing success)
What we used—House of Quality
Using the voice of the customer we built the House of Quality (see 
Figure 11.4). These are the steps we used to build it:
Step 1: List the customer requirements
Step 2: List the technical descriptors (characteristics that will affect more 
than one of the customer requirements, in development or production).
Step 3: Compare the two (customer requirements to technical descriptors) 
and determine relationships.
Step 4: Develop the positive and negative interrelated attributes and 
identify “trade-offs.”
11.3.2.5  Product Design Metrics
The next step was developing the characteristics into metrics in order to 
identify our ideal specifications to meet customer requirements as shown in 
Figure 11.5.

11.3.2.6  Kano Analysis
For the design requirements, the team used the Kano analysis as shown in 
Figure 11.6. First, the team aligned the duffel bag to meet one-dimensional 
needs and their expected quality. Next, the team took the other features and 
developed these as “extra” or exciting quality features so it was easy to dis-
tinguish between the bag and the new technologies we were implementing. 
For the overall design of the NODOR bag we went back through the Kano 
analysis after the final design to ensure quality design.
The first process was to ensure the product met customer needs with the 
basic design. Those features are identified below:
	
1.	A medium-size bag (12″ × 24″)
	
2.	Shoulder carried
	
3.	Weight of less than 2 lbs (empty)
FIGURE 11.4

The next step was to add exciting new qualities:
	
1.	Mesh moisture-wicking liner
	
2.	Fan
	
3.	Scent disruption technology
	
4.	Condensation removal powder (integrated in liner)

Again, the collection of data through the survey fed the ability to split 
the attributes between expected quality and exciting quality. The immediate 
reward for the customers is their expected quality. The key to the marketing 
strategy is the “extra” technology. This is the exciting quality that will sus-
tain the product’s niche in the market.
11.3.3  Define Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How did your team perform the VOC collection? How could VOC 
collection be improved?
	
2.	Did your team create and distribute a customer survey, and if so, 
what is the appropriate statistical analysis to perform to identify the 
importance of the customers’ requirements?
	
3.	Did you perform a quality function deployment (QFD)? How did you 
identify the technical requirements and the correlations between 
customer and technical requirements?
	
4.	What is the value of using the Kano model in your VOC analysis?
11.4  Design Phase
11.4.1  Design Phase Activities
	
1.	 Identify process elements.
	
2.	 Design process.
	
3.	 Identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
11.4.2  Design
In this phase, the team developed seven NODOR bag design concepts with 
regard to the customer requirements and evaluated each of those concepts 
to identify the best and most practically deliverable design that satisfies the 
customer’s needs and our cost factors.
Checklist: Concept generation technique (The Theory of Inventive 
Problem Solving [TRIZ], brainstorming), design for manufacture 
and assembly, concept generation, affinity diagrams, Pugh concept 
evaluation and selection
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Generating seven design concepts that meet customer requirements
•	 Evaluating superior concepts and superior technology to beat 
the market

Final Product: A shoulder-carried duffel bag that has a well-padded 
shoulder strap. The bag will have a corrugated fresh-pack liner that 
will run along the floor of the bag with a disposable baking soda 
membrane encompassing the inside of the bag. It will have a light-
weight exhaust fan that will have a dryer sheet filter and operate on 
battery power with an automatic shutoff of 10 minutes.
11.4.2.1  Pugh’s Concept Selection
Through our product development the team created seven different designs 
of the NODOR bag. In order to determine the concept that had the greatest 
potential for success the team utilized the Pugh concept selection matrix to 
assist in narrowing the scope to a single design as shown in Figure 11.13. 
The team chose Concept 7 because it is currently unlike anything available 
in today’s market and it provides the best results.
The selected design includes the following features:
•	 The bag dimensions will be 12″ × 24″.
•	 It will have a lining for freshness.
•	 The material of the bag will be a breathable fabric.
•	 The shoulder strap will be dual adjustable with a no-twist shoulder 
strap.
•	 It will have a baking soda bag insert.
•	 A fan cooling system will be installed with battery and plug-in 
capabilities.
11.4.2.2  Concept/Design Development
The design can be broken down into different modules (subsystems) accord-
ing to the functions (no odor through air freshening, fan system, filter sys-
tem, baking soda membrane) they perform.

11.5.2  Optimize
In this phase, the team reviewed the selected superior concept to identify 
possible flaws and their effects and probable solutions on how to reduce 
them. The team also compared the influence of one factor on another and 
outside noise factors.
Checklist: Design of experiments, failure mode effect analysis, analy-
sis of mean, analysis of variance, design capability studies, critical 
parameter management
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Identifying noise factors and control factors from both customers 
and competitors
•	 Lowering occurrences of high-severity, high-occurrence defects
•	 Identifying factors that have influence with one another
•	 Determining probable solutions to failure
11.5.2.1  Design for X (DFX)
Design for X is a general term where X can mean any quality or cost criteria 
that affect the product. In the project the following DFX tools were used
•	 Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
•	 Design for Assembly (DFA)
11.5.2.2  Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA)
After developing the final concept design the team decided the bag and the 
components will not be produced in house. However, the final assembly will 
be conducted in house. The components will be outsourced, and the product 
will be assembled in house.
Labor cost:
Assumed labor cost = $10 per hour
After the design for assembly (DFA) matrix was developed, the team final-
ized the sequence of operations to be performed to assemble the bag: *Does not 
take into context the bag itself, assuming an average bag is produced in 3 mins.
	
1.	Time to attach fan to outer compartment—1 min 45 sec
	
2.	Time to attach one filter to outside edges—25 sec (×2) = 50 sec
	
3.	Time to attach mesh membrane—30 sec
	
Total material + Labor cost = $26.00 + $0.75 = $26.75

11.5.2.3  Design of Experiments
The team used design of experiments for the NODOR bag to understand the 
outputs that were affected by different inputs into the system. This method 
allowed the team to optimize results in targeted areas based on the results 
from the VOC and the required functioning parameters. The team deter-
mined the most cost-effective way to conduct product development.
The team used a parameter diagram (P-diagram) to identify areas that 
could be controlled based on the results from the voice of the customers and 
how they are affected by noise factors and combine to be analyzed by our 
measurement metrics (see Figure 11.14).
The effectiveness of the shoulder strap was easy to design based on simple 
weight distribution equations. The team was able to optimize the develop-
ment of a strap that is a dual-adjustable, no-twist shoulder strap that uses a 
load distribution technology for optimal weight distribution, and its ergo-
nomic design ensures comfort.
The team approached durability in the same manner and was able to 
research different materials that are available on the market. Cost analysis 
calculations were then conducted to find the best material that was afford-
able and still keep the price at $35. The team settled on using a waterproof, 
breathable, and durable fabric that is 10 times more durable than cotton 
duck, 3 times more durable than standard polyester, and 2 times more dura-
ble than standard nylon.
In developing the subsystems to diminish odor and moisture of clothes 
in the bag, the team took a current model and retrofitted it with two other 
methods to further diminish odor and moisture. We implemented a lining 
for freshness. The antimicrobial lining keeps the bag odor free. The team

tested the bag’s effectiveness through physical testing over a 6-hour period 
where the goal was to decrease the moisture in the bag by 75%. The lin-
ing only decreased odor by 50% and moisture by 10%. Therefore, the team 
placed a fan in the top compartment of the bag to increase circulation. The 
fan decreased moisture and odor by 60%. A baking soda sack was then 
incorporated that absorbed the remaining 15% of odor and moisture in 
the bag. The team was able to determine the size of the baking soda sack 
through calculating the amount of moisture that an ounce of baking soda 
could absorb.
The team also looked at the robustness of the project to determine if its 
short-term capability exists in the presence of noise factors and if it is tun-
able, meaning that the long-term capability for the bag exists in the presence 
of noise factors. In looking at the external noise factors of the temperature, 
the team cannot control this. It forced the team to treat the bag as a closed 
system and therefore not a significant factor in decreasing the odor and 
moisture in the bag. In looking at the internal noise factors such as absorp-
tion and material, there is more control and their effects are very tunable 
on the bag’s required results. As stated above in the calculations, the team 
was able to determine the optimum material and diminishing capabilities to 
make the bag truly robust.
11.5.3  Optimize Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	How did you define the design of experiment design to use?
	
2.	How did you determine which factors and levels were significant to 
your design?
	
3.	How did you determine the appropriate number of replications for 
your experiment?

1.	Validate process.
	
2.	Assess performance, failure modes, and risks.
	
3.	Iterate design and finalize.
11.6.2  Validate Phase
In this phase, the team verified the final design parameters with responses 
from customers by providing them with three prototypes. The team also 
arrived with feedback from various departments within the NODOR 

284
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
company to identify if this change would affect their performance both in 
the laboratory and if start-up costs could be covered.
Checklist: Measurement system analysis, manufacturing process capa-
bility study, reliability assessment, worst-case analysis, analytical 
tolerance design
Scorecard requirements:
•	 Prototype approved by customer
•	 Meets large portion of customer needs
•	 Ease to manufacture and cost estimate
•	 Reliability performance
The verification of the product design on Concept X is a critical element of 
the process. By modeling sensitivity variations across the product line, a level 
of confidence may be gained from the concept design with regard to potential 
commercialization. Specifically, for the NODOR bag, modeling variance may 
be conducted by using simple linear regression analysis and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA). The metric associated with ANOVA remains the S/N ratio.
Building on the optimization model developed earlier, the objective maxi-
mization of the S/N ratio and establishing a coefficient of determination R2 
that checks testing data to a functional relationship. In this case, the team 
will use a scatterplot of the percent of moisture versus time.
11.6.2.1  Verification Setup
It is known that the fan and baking soda bag reduce moisture significantly; 
however, it is not known if the rate of decrease of the moisture level repre-
sents a linear function. Once the team has received data for the functional 
performance of the final concept, they will verify the time the odor and 
moisture diminish in time in a test setup. The setup is for the R2 testing 
shown in Figure 11.15.
Next, when the variance of moisture percent decrease with regard to time 
is credibly established, an ANOVA experiment is set up based on an orthog-
onal array to determine how the NODOR bag reacts under control parameter 
settings. An L4 orthogonal array is chosen to determine how noise influences 
the system. Figure  11.16 shows the array and control parameters that the 
team set up for the experiment. This is identified by the team as future work.
S/N is computed in the larger, better format and is shown in the equa-
tion below:

The GTSS equation will then lead to a decomposition of the sum of squares

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
12.1  Project Overview
An acute-care hospital recently embarked on building and designing a new 
Women’s Center to respond to the exponential growth of women’s health-
care needs in their market area by redefining, refocusing, reconfiguring, 
and expanding its women’s health services line. They had an existing 
smaller center with fewer services that was part of their outpatient health-
care. It is recognized that a “one-stop shopping” model where women can 
receive a comprehensive range of services conveniently, comfortably, effi-
ciently, and with speed and ease is desirable.
The goal was to provide women’s services in a spa-like environment. The 
Women’s Center will provide the comprehensive list of services shown in 
Figure 12.1. The services will be phased in as the facility is built and funds 
become available.
12.1.1  Project Goals
The intent of the Women’s Center (WC) is to offer a diverse array of women’s 
outpatient services in one location that provides convenient and easy access 
to multiple services including physician, diagnostic, ancillary, education, 
and outreach services. The vision of the WC is to build patient loyalty among 
women in the community and become the provider of choice for all their 
health-care needs. It is expected that the WC will not only increase market 
share for outpatient services but will also increase inpatient volume and 
referrals back to the hospital.

Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
The new Women’s Center plan assumes potential process and staffing 
changes, such as
•	 Having radiology results available while the patient is in the center
•	 Providing the ability to assess authorization of additional diagnostics
•	 Being able to meet with a physician if the patient requests
These process requirements need to be clearly defined before the new pro-
cess and staffing are defined. The requirements significantly impact the pro-
cesses. This project focuses on designing efficient processes that meet the 
needs of the customers (women) who will receive services at the Women’s 
Center. The processes should have work flows that optimize throughput, 
reduce wait times, and provide next-business-day results to the patients who 
receive women’s services.
12.2  Identify Phase Activities

12.2.1  Identify Phase
12.2.1.1  Create Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
Project Overview: Many outpatient facilities are focusing on provid-
ing comprehensive services to women in a comfortable setting. In 
a qualitative study of women who had received a mammogram in 
the prior 3 years, without a history of cancer, satisfaction was related 
to the entire experience, not just the actual mammogram proce-
dure. The authors found seven satisfaction themes from the focus 
groups: (1) appointment scheduling, (2) facility, (3) general exam, (4) 
embarrassment, (5) exam discomfort/pain, (6) treatment by the tech-
nologist, and (7) reporting results (Engelman, Cizik, and Ellerbeck, 
2005). This supports the focus of designing a seamless experience for 
women in the Women’s Center through applying the Design for Six 
Sigma methodology and tool results.
Problem Statement: On average, patients who visit the former Women’s 
Center are transmitted to the primary care provider (PCP) within 
57 hours. There was large variability in how and when the test results 
were communicated to the patients. Some of the questions that the 
team had to answer before the new center opened were as follows:
•	 How do we measure the success of the new women’s center?
•	 What processes will stay the same for the new center?
•	 What processes will be different in the new center?
•	 What is our current state and future state?
•	 Should we perform activities in parallel or series? Or both?
•	 What is our forecasted demand? Do we have different processes 
based on our volume?
•	 What is our goal for waiting time? Is it different for the different 
areas (i.e., registration, radiology reception, gowned waiting room)?
•	 What should we prioritize patients by (i.e., appointment time, 
arrival time, waiting time)?
•	 What is an acceptable wait time when having two tests done?
•	 Will patients have their results available after their tests? 
Will the results be available for all types of tests (diagnostic/
screening)?
•	 Will patients have the ability to meet with a physician given the 
test result comes back requiring further testing?
•	 Will patients be able to get a diagnostic test?

295
Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
Customers/Stakeholders:
External: Patients (women who receive services in the center), refer-
ring physicians, payers, donors
Internal: Imaging technologists, radiologists, administration, regis-
tration, centralized scheduling, information technology, physi-
cians, marketing and development
Goal of the Project: To design the processes and define the metrics that 
result in optimal flow for the new Women’s Center Phase 1.
Scope Statement: The scope includes the new Women’s Center diagnostic 
services (mammography, ultrasound, stereotactic biopsy, and bone 
densitometry), registration, and appointment scheduling.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Patient satisfaction, increased capacity due 
to efficient workflow, and resultant revenue are potential financial 
benefits of this project.
12.2.1.2  Perform Stakeholder Analysis
The stakeholder analysis was performed to identify the project stakeholders. 
The stakeholder analysis definition is shown in Figure 12.2.
12.2.1.3  Create Project Plan
A Gantt chart was used to keep the project development cycle on track and 
ensure that all key steps in the process were accomplished. The Project Plan 
is shown in Figure 12.3. It shows the tasks, task durations, start and end 
dates, predecessors of each task, and the resources to perform each task. The 
project started in March 2010 and finished in November 2010.
12.2.2  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your 
project?

stand the current and potential customers’ requirements.
	
2.	Identify critical to satisfaction (CTS) measures and targets: Based on the 
VOC, determine the CTS measures and then develop targets using 
benchmarking data.
	
3.	Translate VOC into technical requirements: Develop a quality function 
deployment (QFD) House of Quality matrix relating the customer 
requirements to the potential technical or process requirements.
12.2.4  Define Phase
The following is a written report of the Define phase for the project, includ-
ing the key deliverables developed as part of the prior exercises. The Define 
phase of the Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) process is 
designed to gain information on the voice of the customer (VOC) to under-
stand the needs of the customers and begin translating those customer 
requirements into the processes’ technical elements. The main activities of 
this phase are to collect VOC; identify CTS measures and targets; and trans-
late VOC into technical requirements.
12.2.4.1  Collect Voice of the Customer
We first defined the market opportunities through a literature search and 
identified the following findings that support the importance of a women’s 
center:
Market Opportunities:
Specific areas in which women have high mortality and morbidity 
rates include
−
−
60% of hospital patients are women
−
−
50% of all women over age 50 will have osteoporosis
−
−
Hypertension is three times higher for women than men
−
−
Depression is more common in women than men, affecting 
over 7 million women in the United States
−
−
75% of Alzheimer’s patients are women

299
Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
−
−
90% of rheumatoid arthritis cases are women
−
−
90% of patients with lupus are women
−
−
An estimated 10 million women in the United States suffer 
from urinary incontinence
−
−
Women have twice the incidence of multiple sclerosis than men
−
−
1 in 7 women age 45 or older has cardiovascular disease, and 
45% of all female deaths are cardiac related
−
−
Almost 80% of fibromyalgia cases are female
−
−
Over 80% of bariatric surgery patients are women
The team then performed a literature search to identify customer require-
ments that impact satisfaction in a women’s center. Engelman, Cizik, and 
Ellerbeck (2005) performed focus groups to identify the factors and dimen-
sions related to a patient’s experience with a mammography procedure. 
They identified the number of coded text lines from the focus group tran-
scripts for the factors and dimensions related to the patient experience. We 
developed a Pareto chart identifying the most important factors and the 
most important dimensions for each factor. The Pareto chart for the factors 
is shown in Figure 12.4. The percentage importance based on the number of 
coded text lines for the dimensions of each factor are shown in Figures 12.5 
through 12.11.
Scheduling was the highest importance factor, with the most important 
dimensions being scheduling convenience, reasons to schedule a mammo-
gram, and financial issues around paying for a mammogram. Results was

the next most important factor, with the important dimensions being the 
manner in which the results are reported, the time it takes to receive the 
results, and the need to return for suspicious findings or additional proce-
dures. The mammography technologist factor was the next most important 
element, with the important dimensions being the technologist’s attitude 
toward the woman during the exam, the provision of the exam instruc-
tion, and the technologists’ skill in performing the procedure. The facility 
was the next most important factor, with the most important dimension 
including the environment of the waiting room including cleanliness, hav-
ing an educational video and magazines, noise level, décor, and beverage

availability. The general exam was the next most important factor, with 
the issues surrounding the gown worn for the procedure being the most 
important, followed by instructions to prepare for the procedure, and the 
cold or warm machine plate. Discomfort and pain was the next most impor-
tant factor, with the most important dimension including uncomfortable 
pressure due to the breast plate compression. The least most frequently dis-
cussed element of mammograms is the embarrassment factor, including the 
most important dimensions of the embarrassment from participating in an 
exam of a personal nature; embarrassment of discussing the mammogram 
with family, friends, or their health-care provider; and self-consciousness 
due to being modest.

12.2.4.2  Identify Critical to Satisfaction (CTS) Measures and Targets
The Women’s Center is fortunate to have some very special donors and 
supporters. Marketing held several focus groups to understand their critical 
requirements, so that we could extract the CTS criteria from the focus group 
qualitative data. The CTS are shown in Figure 12.12.
12.2.4.3  Translate Voice of the Customer (VOC) into Technical Requirements
12.2.4.3.1  Quality Function Deployment
Using VOC we built three Houses of Quality. These are the steps we used to 
build it:
Step 1: List the customer requirements with their importance rating on 
a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high).
Step 2: List the technical process requirements that will affect more 
than one of the customer requirements, in the process.
Step 3: Compare the two (customer requirements to the technical cus-
tomer requirements) and determine the relationships, identifying a 
strong relationship (9), medium relationship (3), low relationship (1), 
or no relationship (blank).
Step 4: Obtain the weighting and ranking for the process requirements.
Step 5: Carry the weighting to the second House of Quality. Place the 
process requirements on the left vertically, and identify the process 
components that will help to meet the process requirements.
Step 6: Determine the relationships between the process requirements 
and the process components.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
12.3.1  Design Phase
The following is a written report of the Design phase for the Women’s Center 
Process Design project. The Design phase of the DFSS process is focused on 
designing a process and the potential failures so they are reduced or elimi-
nated with the potential to achieve a Six Sigma quality level. The main activi-
ties of this phase are as follows: identify the process elements, design the 
process, and identify potential risks and inefficiencies.
12.3.1.1  Develop New Processes
A business scenario method was used to develop the new processes. The 
following are the steps that we applied (TOGAF, 2011):
	
1.	Identify the business scenario objectives: Design the new processes to 
meet the customer requirements and CTS characteristics identified 
in the VOC analysis.
	
2.	Identify the business scenarios to generate: The core processes were 
identified for the business scenarios.
•	 Schedule service
•	 Register patient
•	 Perform service
•	 Provide results
•	 Provide spiritual care
•	 Connect to cancer center
•	 Authorize service
•	 Self-referral
•	 Request films
•	 Receive referral
•	 Perform surgery
•	 VIP (very important person) processing
•	 Patient navigator processing
	
3.	Develop the business scenarios, asking the following questions for each 
scenario:
•	 What is the overall objective of the scenario?
•	 What are any preconditions that must exist to start the scenario?
•	 What are the inputs (information, etc.) used to start the scenario?
•	 Walk through the “happy path” steps to get to the end result.

313
Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
•	 Walk through alternate steps to get to the end result; and “not” 
to get to the end result (failure).
•	 Think of who the person would interact with along the way.
•	 Think of what systems the person might interact with (generally).
•	 Think of assumptions or needs the person might expect to 
require during the scenario.
•	 What is the final outcome, result, or output?
•	 What are the resources and people needed?
	
4.	Review the scenarios with the team and revise as necessary
	
5.	Develop the process maps from the business scenarios
The business scenario template is shown in Figure 12.17.
A sample business scenario for Provide Imaging Results is shown in 
Figure 12.18.
12.3.1.2  Perform Process Analysis
The process analysis defined the process inefficiencies for each proposed 
process (Figure 12.19).
The following gaps were identified between the current and future state 
process maps:
•	 Lack of seamless integration between the hospital medical  informa-
tion system and the medical group information system
•	 Triage for spiritual care
•	 Referral physician preference cards
•	 Concierge process
•	 Patient navigator and patient navigator process
•	 Patient navigator database and application to track patient interaction
•	 Track utilization of spiritual care
•	 Track connection to cancer center
•	 Defined service levels for processes
•	 Next-day results not meeting marketed expectations of same-day 
results
•	 Seamless online appointment scheduling
•	 Navigating through the Women’s Center
•	 Detailed future state process maps need to be completed

12.3.1.3  Perform Waste Analysis
The following wastes were identified for the future state processes, shown 
in Figure 12.21.
Inefficiency
Process: Schedule Service
Having to do a warm transfer from Central Scheduling to Women’s Center (WC) Medical Group 
physician
Process: Register Patient
If patient is not preregistered, know late in the registration process that he or she is a VIP (not prior to 
arriving in WC)
Should ensure all patient items are available and accurate prior to registration in WC (labs, script, ID)
Ensure only needed patient information is provided from the patient when they register an existing 
patient (between imaging and doctor)
Authorize Service
Multiple rework loops if authorization is not OK or correct
Having to obtain a changed order for Medicare patient
Provide Spiritual Care
Resourcing for WC needs to be identified
Connect to Cancer Center
Potential of not having preference card or not having it updated
Self-Referral
Identify if accept self-referrals
Perform Surgery
Rework getting labs, prep work, patient information, and so forth
Multiple calls getting health history; informing of copay
Getting lab results timely
Having to bill from radiology to surgery and then have radiology reimbursed

12.3.1.4  Create Operational Definitions and Conceptual Model
The following operational definitions were developed for the results times:
Operational definition: Time from arrival in imaging reception to exam
Defining the measure: Focus is on the time it takes to present at the radiol-
ogy reception desk until procedure initiated
Purpose: We want to understand how long patients wait.
Clear way to measure the process: We will measure the time that a patient 
waits in the waiting area of the Radiology department. This will be 
measured by calculating the elapsed time from when the patient 
presents at the Imaging reception desk until they enter the proce-
dure room. To baseline we will use QueVision data from 4/1 to 6/24 
and subtract CheckInTime from InProcessTime.
Operational definition: Time from procedure start to procedure completion
Process
Types of Waste
•	Schedule
Overproduction: transfer between central scheduler and medical group
Processing: duplicate information in medical information and 
physician system.
•	Register patient
Defect: VIP patient not identified prior to visit or during visit
Defect: patient forgets prescription
Processing and Delay: need to call physician’s office for prescription
Delay: register walk-ins
•	Authorize patient
Defect: wrong insurance
Defect: wrong authorization
Delay: verify medical necessity
Processing: receive change order
•	Provide spiritual care
Delay: availability of resources
•	Connect to cancer center
Motion: patient going from Women’s Center (WC) to cancer center
Delay: due to not having physician preferences to contact patient
•	Process self-referral
Delay: referral to physician
•	Perform surgery
Overproduction: scheduling and patient information in surgery system
•	Perform imaging service
Delay: wait times in lobby, procedure room
•	Perform physician service
Delay: wait times in lobby, room
•	Provide results
Delay: providing results
Delay: physician providing results
Delay: not having physician preferences for patient contact
Delay: radiologist reading
Delay: not reaching patient
•	Patient navigator
Inventory: patient navigator capacity
•	Request records/films
Delay: printing films
•	Process VIP patients
Defect: VIP patient not identified as VIP
Delay: difficulty fitting VIP in schedule

Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
Defining the measure: The focus is on the time it takes to complete procedures.
Purpose: We want to understand how long a procedure takes.
Clear way to measure the process: We will measure the time that a patient 
spends in a procedure room in the Radiology department. This 
will be measured by calculating the elapsed time from when the 
patient enters the procedure room until the procedure is complete. 
To baseline we will use QueVision data from 4/1 to 6/24 and subtract 
InProcessTime from CompletedTime:Mammo.
Operational definition: Time from procedure completion to when results 
are available
Defining the measure: The focus is on the time it takes to result and trans-
mit procedure results
Purpose: We want to understand how long it takes for procedure results 
to be available.
Clear way to measure the process: We will measure the time that a radi-
ologist takes to result procedures and for the techs to upload them 
into the medical information system for transmission. This will be 
measured by calculating the elapsed time from when the procedure 
is complete until it is available to the primary care physician (PCP).
Operational definition: Time from exam completion to review with patient
Defining the measure: The focus is on the time it takes to communicate 
results to patients.
The Women’s Center Conceptual Model helps to identify the key elements 
required for the Women’s Center, shown in Figure 12.22.

1.	Design Report
	
a.	 Review the design report and brainstorm some areas for 
improving the report.
	
b.	 How did your team ensure the quality of the written report? How 
did you assign the work to your team members? Did you face 
any challenges of team members not completing their assigned 
tasks in a timely manner, and how did you deal with it?
	
c.	 Did your team face difficult challenges in the Design phase? 
How did your team deal with conflict on your team?
	
d.	 Did your instructor and/or Black Belt or Master Black Belt men-
tor help your team better learn how to apply the Design for Six 
Sigma tools in the Design phase, and how?
	
e.	 Did your Design Phase Report provide a clear understanding of 
the root causes of the discipline process, why or why not?

3.	Statistical Process Control: Develop an example of a control chart that 
could be used to ensure that the process stays in control.
	
4.	Process Capability: Perform a capability analysis to assess whether the 
process is capable of meeting the target metrics.
	
5.	Revised Process Map: Revise your process map to incorporate 
improvements that will further enhance the process.
	
6.	Training plans, procedures: Create a training plan and a detailed proce-
dure for the new process.
12.4.2  Optimize Phase
The purpose of the Optimize phase is to pilot the new processes and assess 
whether they are capable of meeting the desired targets. The following activ-
ities are performed:
	
1.	Implement pilot processes.
	
2.	Assess process capabilities.
	
3.	Optimize design.
12.4.2.1  Implement Pilot Process
We implemented the processes when the Women’s Center opened in 
September 2010, and compared the process times to the baseline in the pre-
vious imaging center. A detailed work plan was developed that included the 

328
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
activities required to open the facility and implement the newly designed 
processes. The key process elements implemented were
•	 Hire a patient navigator to navigate the patient through the system 
and communicate results of procedures.
•	 Hire an additional radiologist to provide results more quickly.
•	 Unveil a new spa-like facility.
•	 Incorporate additional services.
•	 Hire a women’s services focused physician.
•	 Train mammography technicians in customer service.
•	 Incorporate spiritual care resources into the center.
•	 Cross-train registration staff in imaging center and physician office 
scheduling systems.
•	 Hire a concierge to guide patients to their destinations.
•	 Have volunteers walk patients to their destinations.
•	 Incorporate a VIP service.
•	 Implement a process dashboard for metrics.
•	 Incorporate advanced imaging technology.
12.4.2.2  Assess Process Capabilities
The proposed value stream map for the initial mammogram screening was 
developed to assess process capability, shown in Figure 12.23. The process 
as designed will be capable of meeting the proposed wait times, procedure 
times, throughput time, and results time.
12.4.2.3  Optimize Design
We identified potential problems in the processes after they were piloted and 
created three Why-Why diagrams (Figures 12.24, 12.25, and 12.26):
•	 Why are there excessive wait times in the WC?
•	 Why do procedures take more than one business day to result?
•	 Why does it take a long time for the patients to receive the results?
Further improvements were designed to streamline the processes, based 
on staffing, results turnaround, and throughput times. The patient navi-
gator was hired in the first quarter of 2011. She has provided great value 
for our patients and referring physicians. She provides sociopsychologi-
cal care to our patients by providing results more timely, guiding them

Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
A takt time throughput analysis was performed to assess whether the 
cycle times could achieve the needed takt time. Takt time is calculated based 
on the available time of scheduled resources divided by the number of 
scheduled procedures. Figure 12.27 shows there are times of the day when 
the scheduled procedures exceed the staff capacity. This analysis helped to 
realign the staffing to meet the patients’ demand. The continuous line shows 
the desired takt time, and the box plots show when the average cycle time 
exceeds the desired takt time.
The results for the newly designed processes are shown in Figure 12.28 
and compared to the older imaging facility. The waiting time in the imaging

12.4.3  Optimize Phase Case Discussion
12.4.3.1  Optimize Report
	
1.	Review the Optimize report and brainstorm some areas for improv-
ing the report.
	
2.	How did your team ensure the quality of the written report? How 
did you assign the work to your team members? Did you face any 
challenges of team members not completing their assigned tasks in 
a timely manner, and how did you deal with it?
	
3.	Did your team face difficult challenges in the Optimize phase? How 
did your team deal with conflict on your team?
	
4.	Did your instructor and/or Black Belt or Master Black Belt mentor 
help your team better learn how to apply the Design for Six Sigma 
tools in the Optimize phase, and how?
	
5.	Did your Optimize phase report provide a clear understanding of 
the root causes of the discipline process? Why or why not?
	
6.	Compare your Optimize report to the Optimize report in the 
book. What are the major  differences between your report and the 
author’s report?
	
7.	How would you improve your report?
12.4.3.2  Implementation Plan
	
1.	How must the culture be considered in an implementation plan?
	
2.	How must the communication be considered in an implementation 
plan?
	
3.	How did your Lean Six Sigma team identify the timings for when to 
implement your  recommendations?
12.4.3.3  Process Capability
	
1.	Why is it important to assess process capability?
	
2.	Why is it important to ensure that your process is stable before 
assessing process capability?

Design of Women’s Center Service Processes
12.5  Validate Phase Activities
	
1.	Dashboards/scorecards: Create a dashboard or scorecard for tracking 
and controlling the process.
	
2.	Mistake proofing: Create a mistake-proofing plan to prevent errors 
from occurring in the process.
	
3.	Hypothesis testing/analysis of variance (ANOVA): Using the data 
provided in the report, perform the appropriate Hypothesis test 
or ANOVA to compare process time metrics before and after 
improvement.
	
4.	Replication opportunities: Identify some potential replication opportu-
nities within or outside the division to apply the same or a similar 
process.
12.5.1  Validate Phase
The Validate phase validates the processes and ensures that they meet the cus-
tomers’ needs. The following activities are performed in the Validate phase:
	
1.	Validate processes.
	
2.	Assess performance, failure modes, and risks.
	
3.	Iterate design and finalize.
12.5.1.1  Validate Processes
A dashboard was developed that could be reviewed continuously during the 
day, to assess the wait times, procedure times, throughput times, patients 
waiting for procedures, volume, and results times. A more static dashboard 
was created that would track performance on a monthly basis, shown in 
Figure 12.29. The metrics were being met for average procedure time, average 
wait time, and average throughput time, but were not meeting targets for per-
cent of patients waiting more than 45 minutes and percent of mammography 
patients being contacted by the navigator within 5 days of service. We con-
tinued to adjust staffing and improve the processes to better meet the targets.
12.5.1.2  Assess Performance, Failure Modes, and Risks
We assessed the potential failure modes in the processes and identified the 
potential risks:
	
1.	Focusing on productivity as the key metric impacts our ability to 
meet the quality indicators of patient wait and throughput times.

336
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
	
2.	The patient navigator continues to meet with referring physicians 
to describe the patient navigator services available, and complete 
physician preference cards that identify when it is appropriate for 
the patient navigator to share the patient results directly with the 
patients and the time frame to do so.
	
3.	Identifying the VIP members has been problematic with an informa-
tion systems issue. This issue has been logged for the Information 
Technology Help Desk.
	
4.	There are several outstanding action items that have not yet been 
resolved and need the executive team to embrace and resolve the more 
political issues related to growth, volume, and physician relationships.
12.5.1.3  Iterate Design and Finalize
The new design has been stabilized but will be continually improved and 
monitored.
12.6  Conclusions
The Design for Six Sigma methodology was extremely successful in captur-
ing the voice of the customer and translating the customer requirements into 
the process requirements and for designing a process that delights the custom-
ers of the Comprehensive Women’s Center. The opening of the new Women’s 
Center has surpassed the organization’s and the customers’ expectations. The

Project Charter Review Process Design
13.1  Project Overview
The Information System Division of a major Fortune 500 corporation devel-
ops applications to support the business. The division had been review-
ing and approving the projects in a cross-divisional weekly meeting with 
the senior executives. The project charter is developed by the application 
development team working with the business to understand the scope of 
the proposed project. The project charter includes a description of the busi-
ness opportunity, identification of the customers and stakeholders, the goals 
and objectives of the project, as well as the metrics that assess the successful 
completion of the project. The project charter also includes identification of 
the potential risks that could prevent the project from being successfully 
completed, and the assumptions that are assumed to be true. An initial 
estimate of the resources and project costs and the hard and soft benefits 
for doing the project are also assessed. The hard benefits identify financial 
savings that impact the financial statements, while the soft benefits include 
cost avoidance and intangible benefits to the business for doing the project. 
The customer signatures signifying buy-in to the project are also included 
on the project charter. The division’s Program Management Office (PMO) 
provides project management standards, guidance, and training to the divi-
sion. They have recently decentralized the project charter approval process 
to the senior vice presidents’ (SVP) areas. The review and approval of proj-
ects had been performed at a divisional level, looking only at projects that 
were greater than a thousand hours of effort. If projects were under 1000 
hours of total effort, they were reviewed by VPs, but not across the SVP area. 
The goal was to get more visibility of all projects across the entire SVP area. 
The approval from the customer will be attained, and then the information 
system division SVP area will review the project charter to identify any 
cross-area conflicts or overlap and ensure that resources are available to 
work on the project.
The Process and Metrics (P&M) team in the SVP’s area has been assigned 
the responsibility of designing a new Area Council review process to assess 
the quality of the project charter, and incorporate appropriate metrics to 
baseline and encourage continuous process improvement. The divisional 
standards should be maintained to ensure consistency and repeatability of

the project chartering process. The stakeholders of the new process include 
the management team, who will review and approve the projects within the 
information system division; the Process and Metrics team, who will assess 
the quality of the project charters and execute the Area Council review pro-
cess; the PMO, who provides the divisional standards for reviewing the 
project charters; the project leaders, who create the project charters; and the 
business, for whom the project charters are developed.
13.2  Identify Phase Exercises
It is recommended that the students work in project teams of four to six stu-
dents throughout the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) case study.
	
1.	Identify Phase Written Report: Prepare a written report from the case 
study exercises that describes the Identify phase activities and key 
findings.
	
2.	Design for Six Sigma Project Charter: Use the information provided in 
the “Project Overview” section above, in addition to the project char-
ter format to develop a project charter for the Design for Six Sigma 
project.
	
3.	Stakeholder Analysis: Use the information provided in the “Project 
Overview” section above, in addition to the stakeholder analysis for-
mat to develop a stakeholder analysis, including stakeholder analy-
sis roles and impact definition, and stakeholder resistance to change.
	
4.	Team Ground Rules and Roles: Develop the project team’s ground rules 
and team members’ roles.
	
5.	Project Plan and Responsibilities Matrix: Develop your team’s project 
plan for the DMAIC project. Develop a responsibilities matrix to 
identify the team members who will be responsible for completing 
each of the project activities.
	
6.	Identify Phase Presentation: Prepare a presentation (PowerPoint) from 
the case study exercises that provides a short (10 to 15 minutes) oral 
presentation of the Identify phase deliverables and findings.

understand the opportunity and business that needs a new process to be 
designed, and to develop a project charter and appropriate scope to design 
the process. The main activities in the Identify phase are to develop project 
charter, perform stakeholder analysis, and develop project plan.
13.2.1.2  Design for Six Sigma Project Charter
The Process and Metrics (P&M) team in the Information System Division’s 
Senior Vice President’s (SVP) area has been assigned the responsibility of 
designing a new Area Council review process to assess the quality of the 
project charter, and incorporate appropriate metrics to baseline and encour-
age continuous process improvement. The divisional standards should be 
maintained to ensure consistency and repeatability of the project charter-
ing process. The stakeholders of the new process include the management 
team, who will review and approve the projects within the information sys-
tem division; the Process and Metrics team, who will assess the quality of 
the project charters and execute the Area Council review process; the PMO, 
who provides the divisional standards for reviewing the project charters; the 
project leaders, who create the project charters; and the business, for whom 
the project charters are developed.
Following are the sections that compose the project charter, which 
defines the problem to be investigated. The project charter is shown in 
Figure 13.1.
The Information System Division develops applications to support the 
business. The division’s Program Management (PM) office members along 
with the division’s management had been reviewing and approving the proj-
ects in a cross-divisional weekly meeting with the senior executives. The 
project charter is developed by the application development team working 
with the business to understand the scope of the proposed project. The proj-
ect charter includes a description of the business opportunity, identification 
of the customers and stakeholders, the goals and objectives of the project, as 
well as the metrics that assess the successful completion of the project. The 
project charter also includes identification of the potential risks that could 
prevent the project from being successfully completed, and the assump-
tions that are assumed to be true. An initial estimate of the resources and 
project costs and the hard and soft benefits for doing the project are also 
assessed. The hard benefits identify financial savings that impact the finan-
cial statements, while the soft benefits include cost avoidance and intangible 
benefits to the business for doing the project. The customer signatures sig-
nifying buy-in to the project are also included on the project charter. The 
division’s Program Management Office (PMO) provides project management 
standards, guidance, and training to the division. They have recently decen-
tralized the project charter approval process to the senior vice presidents’ 
(SVP) areas. The approval from the customer will be attained, and then the 
information system division SVP’s area will review the project charter to

identify any cross-area conflicts or overlap and ensure resources are avail-
able to work on the project.
Project Name: Project Charter Review Process Design
Problem Statement: To design a process for the area to review the proj-
ect charters and determine if the project should move forward to 
the next phase. Project charters are the project initiation document 
that identifies a need in the business to perform information sys-
tems work.
Customers/Stakeholders: The primary stakeholders are the management 
team, who will review and approve the project charters, the project 
leaders, who will develop the project charters, and the Process and 
Metrics team, who will execute the process. The secondary stake-
holders are the customers, for whom the application development 
teams are developing applications, and the Program Management 
Office, who develops and ensures divisional standards are followed.
What is Important to These Customers (Critical to Satisfaction, CTS): The 
management team wants a simple and timely process that provides 
visibility of the status of the projects that enable the teams to meet 
the business’ information system needs. The project leaders want

Problem Statement: To design a process for the area to review the project charters to determine if the 
project should move forward to the next phase. A project charter is the project initiation document 
that identifies a need in the business to perform information systems work.
Customer/Stakeholders: The Program Management Office (PMO) has recently decentralized the review of 
project charters to the areas, resulting in the need for creating a process to review the project charters to 
ensure that they are providing value to the business, and communicating the type of information needed 
to identify risks and manage projects and resources at an area level.
What Is Important to These Customers—Critical to Satisfaction (CTS): All necessary fields are completed; provide 
accurate information to make decisions; review is timely. Obtain approval to continue with the project.
Goal of the Project: To provide a process that provides a timely and complete review and decision to 
continue (or not) with the project.
Scope Statement: This process includes the review of the project charters at an area level. Includes project 
review of the project charter, provides review of the format and content of the project charter, and 
provides approval of the project charter at appropriate management levels. Link this process to the 
quality goals of the organization. This process is just for the identified area.
Financial and Other Benefit(s): Consistent process, visibility of projects across area to identify overlap and 
resource sharing.
Project Deliverables: Project charter review process; scorecard and metrics with baseline and target goals, 
and appropriate visibility of reporting requirements.
Potential Risks: Being perceived as a bureaucratic instead of value-added process; acceptance and 
adherence of process of area; timeliness of review.

The Process and Metrics team wants to implement a simple and 
measureable process that is of high quality. The business customers 
want the desired functionality to be delivered in a timely manner. 
The Program Management Office wants the standards to be fol-
lowed in a consistent and repeatable manner.
Goal of the Project: To provide a process that provides a timely and com-
plete review and decision to continue (or not) with the project.
Scope Statement: This process includes the review of the project char-
ters at an area level. It includes project review of the project charter, 
review of the format and content of the project charter, and approval 
of the project charter at appropriate management levels. It should 
link this process to the quality goals of the organization. This pro-
cess is just for the identified area.
Projected Financial and Other Benefits: Consistent process, visibility of 
projects across area to identify overlap and resource sharing.
Risk Management Matrix: The risk management matrix is shown in 
Figure 13.2. The main risks are not having time to get buy-in from 
the major stakeholders; communication of the new process may not 
be complete and of high quality; need to consider needed training 
and rollout; being considered as a bureaucratic rather than a value-
added process; and timeliness of the review.

The business case for this project is that divisional management has made a 
decision to review information system project charters at the senior vice presi-
dent level to provide visibility at the area level. This created an immediate need 
to design an Area Council review process within the area to ensure consistency 
across the division and enable improvement and visibility within the area.
13.2.1.3  Customers/Stakeholder Analysis
The Program Management Office (PMO) recently decentralized the review 
of project charters to the areas, resulting in the need for creating a process to 
review the project charters to ensure they are providing value to the business, 
and communicating the type of information needed to identify risks and 
manage projects and resources at an area level. The newly formed Process 
and Metrics team was assigned the task to design a new Area Council review 
process. The team decided that they will use the Design for Six Sigma tools 
and IDDOV (Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate) methodology to 
ensure a fact-based process is used to design the new process, and to ensure 
that appropriate measures are incorporated into the process. The primary 
stakeholders are the management team, who will review and approve the 
project charters, the project leaders, who will develop the project charters, 
and the Process and Metrics team, who will execute the process. The second-
ary stakeholders are the customers, for whom the application development 
teams are developing applications, and the Program Management Office, 
who develops and ensures divisional standards are followed.
Figure  13.3 shows the primary and secondary stakeholders, and their 
major concerns. Note that “+” represents a positive impact or potential 
improvement, while “–“ represents a potential negative impact to the 
project.
Figure 13.4 shows the commitment level of each major stakeholder group 
at the beginning of the project.

in the business, and when it is occurring. The problem statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the problem 
statement in the Identify phase written report provide a clear pic-
ture of the business problem? Rewrite the problem statement to 
improve it.
	
2.	The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective and 
be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the Identify phase goal statement 
to improve it.

13.3.1.1.1  Define Report
Following is a written report of the Define phase for the project charter review 
process design project, including the key deliverables developed as part of the 
prior exercises. The Define phase of the IDDOV process is designed to gain infor-
mation on the voice of the customer (VOC) to understand the needs of the cus-
tomers and begin translating those customer requirements into the processes’ 
technical elements. The main activities of this phase are to collect VOC; identify 
CTS measures and targets; and translate VOC into technical requirements.
13.3.1.1.2  Data Collection Plan and Voice of Customer
The data collection plan is shown in Figure 13.6. It summarizes the potential 
metrics and how we would collect data to measure the metrics. This will

include information on a proposed process and VOC information. The VOC 
data collection consisted of interviewing the stakeholders to understand 
what is critical to their satisfaction for the new process, as well as harvesting 
information on similar processes, and data related to initial design thoughts 
for the process.
The senior vice president (SVP), the vice presidents (VP), the directors, pro-
gram and project leaders, the Process and Metrics team, the enterprise and 
solution architects, who provide cross-area planning of information system 
blueprints and roadmaps, and the PMO were all interviewed.
The management team (SVP, VPS, and directors) wanted to ensure the pro-
grams and projects are on budget, have resources, and have key sponsors. 
They also wanted to be able to decide whether they should do the project 
work or not, and understand how the programs and projects affect other

teams within the area and the division. They want to be able to have visibil-
ity and knowledge when there is a problem or issue with the project which 
potentially puts the project at risk of successful completion. The manage-
ment team wants to be able to understand the project priorities and have the 
visibility to know if they are working on the right priorities, as well as have a 
way to periodically review the work being performed in the area.
Some of the questions that they would ask when reviewing projects are 
as follows:
•	 What is the scope of processes in the project?
•	 Should we buy versus build?
•	 What is the impact to the business?
•	 Should we outsource any part of the development work?
•	 Do we have engagement from the business areas?
•	 What business resources will be required?
•	 Is there an existing process that they are enhancing?
•	 Is infrastructure needed?
•	 Do we have the resources necessary to do the work, or what must be 
reprioritized to be able to do this work?
The program and project leaders’ concerns and critical drivers were to 
provide resource allocation and management across the programs and proj-
ects. The Process and Metrics team, who is responsible for the Area Council 
review process, wants a simple process that is metrics based and encourages 
continuous process improvement for initiating new projects and ensures 
that there is customer/stakeholder buy-in to the new process.
The enterprise architects were concerned about the ability to be able to see 
program and project dependencies and assess the impact of adding projects 
to the business and the information system division. They wanted to pro-
vide visibility of program and project changes and periodic updates to the 
programs and projects. The architects also wanted to ensure appropriate 
resource management.
The PMO wants a review that supports and aligns with the divisional 
standards and the information system development life cycle.
To measure the timely process, we would track that the Area Council 
review process is held every first and third Tuesday of the month. To help 
meet the CTS for having a high-quality process with metrics and accurate 
project information, we built a scorecard that would assess both format and 
quality of the content on the project charter. The format scorecard criteria 
would ensure that all of the required fields are completed. The content score-
card criteria would assess the quality of the information in the fields against 
the project charter standard documentation. To assess the ability to make 
go/no go decisions on the projects, the percent of projects reviewed and 

353
Project Charter Review Process Design
approved or deferred will be tracked at the review meetings. The visibility 
of projects related to programs can be tracked by counting the number of 
projects that have a program identified with it.
13.3.1.1.3  Critical to Satisfaction Summary
The VOC provided insight into the CTS criteria for the project, summa-
rized below:
•	 Timely process
•	 High-quality process with metrics
•	 Accurate information
•	 Ability to make decisions, go/no go on projects
•	 Visibility to program/project relationships
It is important to the project leaders, application development teams, and 
management that the review process provides a timely review and approval 
of projects so the teams can get started working on the information systems 
projects. It is also important to have a high-quality project initiation process 
and that the metrics designed enable continuous process improvement and 
provide project charters that are well scoped. The new process will also need 
to enable the ability to make decisions on whether to approve the projects or 
not, providing information on the business opportunity, goals, and objec-
tives of the projects. The process should also provide visibility of the projects 
and resources required across the area.
13.3.1.1.4  Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
The QFD House of Quality was used to ensure alignment between customer 
and stakeholder needs represented by the CTS criteria and the technical 
requirements of the process design. After collecting the VOC information 
that allowed insight into the CTS criteria summarized across all of the stake-
holders, the Process and Metrics team brainstormed the critical elements to 
be designed into the new process (technical requirements). The House of 
Quality is shown in Figure 13.7. The Process and Metrics team assessed the 
strength of relationship between the CTS criteria and the design criteria. An 
importance rating was assigned to each of the CTS, which was then multi-
plied by the relationship ratings, to derive a relative weighting of the techni-
cal requirements. A Pareto chart is shown in Figure 13.8. An Area Council 
SharePoint (Microsoft intranet Web site software) would be a way to provide 
a workflow and facilitate the review process. Executive approval is another 
critical element that should be designed into the new process. Without it there 
is little chance for the organization to see the value of the reviews, if the man-
agement team is not on board. Detailed procedures and a process map will 
provide clear definition of the process and can be used as a training guide, 
along with workshops to train on the process. A scorecard with definitive 

354
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
criteria for assessing the format and quality of the project charter content is 
the next most important design criteria, followed by the need for the Process 
and Metrics team to review the project charters. This will ensure consistency 
of the measurement process. A stakeholder survey is the last design criteria 
that could be used to validate the new process.

13.4.1  Design Phase Exercises
13.4.1.1  Design Report
Create a Design phase report, including your findings, results, and conclu-
sions of the Design phase.
Process Map: Develop a process map for the process.
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis: Create a failure mode and effect analysis, 
brainstorming potential failures in the project charter review process.
Process Analysis: Prepare a process analysis for the proposed process.
Waste Analysis: Perform a waste analysis for the proposed process.
Operational Definitions: Develop metrics and operational definitions 
that relate to the CTS for the new process.
Design Phase Presentation: Prepare a presentation (PowerPoint) from the 
case study exercises that provides a short (10 to 15 minutes) oral pre-
sentation of the Design phase deliverables and findings.
Design Report: Following is a written report of the Design phase for the 
project charter review process design, including the key deliverables 
developed as part of the prior exercises.
The Design phase of the DFSS process is focused on designing a process 
and the potential failures so they are reduced or eliminated with the poten-
tial to achieve a Six Sigma quality level. The main activities of this phase are 
as follows: identify process elements, design process, and identify potential 
risks and inefficiencies.

Project Charter Review Process Design
13.4.1.2  Process Map
The team developed the critical elements to be incorporated into the process 
as follows:
•	 Management commitment and review
•	 Metrics to encourage continuous improvement
•	 Area review meetings on the first and third Tuesdays
•	 Development team and VP area reviews of project charters before 
going to the Area Council
•	 SharePoint used to manage Area Council workflow and agenda
•	 Criteria set to review certain projects across the entire division
•	 Skills need to be transferred to project leads to develop high-quality 
project charters.
•	 Process needs to be simple and based on voice of customer input.
The team designed the new process using the VOC information and the 
process elements as a guide. The process map is shown in Figure 13.9. A 
description of the process follows.
13.4.1.2.1  Review Project Charter, Enter into Area 
Council (AC) SharePoint, Enter Scorecard
Owners: Development Team
Purpose: For the development team and the Area Director to review 
the project charter and ensure the completeness and content is of 
high quality
Steps:
	
1.	 The development team will review their project charter within 
their team/director area. The initiation scorecard can be used as 
a guide for the format and content quality levels.
	
2.	 The project leader should enter the project information in the 
SharePoint, with a “Status Initiation” of “pending.”
	
3.	 The development team should complete the initiation scorecard 
via the Area Council SharePoint.
13.4.1.2.2  Approve?
Owners: Development team, manager/senior manager, director (as 
appropriate)
Purpose: To approve the project charter. This approval includes the 
format, content, and that the project charter addresses the business 
needs to be included in the scope of the project charter effort.

the division’s project council
Step:
	
1.	They will decide whether this project charter should be reviewed 
at the division’s project council, typically based upon project size 
(>1000 hours) and other risk criteria, such as the cross-functional 
nature of the project, impact to the business, and so forth.
13.4.1.2.14  Schedule for Division’s Project Council
Owners: Management team
Purpose: To schedule project charters that need to be reviewed in the 
division project council meetings.

362
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
Steps:
	
1.	If it is decided that the project charter will be reviewed at the divi-
sion’s project council, it will be automatically scheduled for divi-
sion’s project council by updating the project council field on the 
Area Council SharePoint.
	
2.	Division will pull the project charter for the division’s project coun-
cil meetings, based on the Area Council SharePoint site.
13.4.1.2.15  Notify Project Leader of Status and Next Steps (via E-Mail)
Owners: Area Council
Purpose: To notify the project leader of the status of the project and the 
next steps
Steps:
	
1.	The project leader will receive an e-mail telling him or her whether 
his or her project was approved or rejected.
	
2.	The e-mail will contain any necessary next steps. For example, if the 
project is approved, the project leader will be asked to enter his or 
her review date for requirements into the SharePoint.
13.4.1.3	Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
The team created a failure mode and effect analysis, brainstorming poten-
tial failures in the project charter review process. The FMEA is shown in 
Figure 13.10 with the Pareto chart prioritizing the failure modes by the risk 
priority number (RPN) shown in Figure 13.11. The highest RPN based on the 
severity, occurrence, and detection, included resources not being available, a 
project not getting marked as approved, a scorecard not being created, and 
a project charter not being reviewed by the team prior to being reviewed 
by the Area Council team. We identified and incorporated a recommended 
action into the process and procedures based on the potential failures.
13.4.1.4	Process Analysis
A process value analysis was performed to assess which of the activities 
provided value to the process. Inherently, the review of the project char-
ter is an inspection step, if the training is done well, the appropriate skills 
would be transferred to the project charter preparers and a review step 
would not be necessary. However, some of the value of the review is to 
communicate which projects are being done across the area, and to be able 
to allocate resources across the entire area. The activities in the process that 
were defined as value added are the actual decisions to approve or reject 
the project, the Area Council review held with the senior vice president, 
the vice presidents and directors, and the communication to the project

Project Charter Review Process Design
leads of whether the project was approved, deferred, or rejected. The Area 
Council review provides value from providing communication of work 
being performed across the area, and the potential to allocate resources 
across projects, and find and eliminate any project redundancies. The com-
munication of the project approval to the project leads so that the team can 
move forward on the project also provides value. Only 25% of the activi-
ties add value to the process, with 75% of the activities being non-value-
added. There is still a great deal of opportunity to incorporate preventive 
activities and training into the process to further reduce the number of 
reviews necessary to get a high-quality project charter. The results of the 
process value analysis combined with the waste analysis results are shown 
in Figure 13.12.
13.4.1.5	Waste Analysis
A waste analysis was performed on the process. The main types of waste 
are related to processing embedded in the nature of the process. The proj-
ect charter review process is being created to provide communication of the 
work across the entire area and even the entire information systems division, 
to potentially share resources, and to ensure a high-quality project charter.

However, there are several levels of review, and the focus of the process 
should be to incorporate more up-front preventive activities such as train-
ing to reduce the number of reviews necessary to get to a high-quality level. 
When problems are discovered, this is a defect waste. There are many steps 
in the process that identify defects, and prevention activities should be incor-
porated to try to reduce or avoid the mistake in the first place. The waste 
analysis identifying the types of waste for each major step in the process is 
shown in Figure 13.12.
13.4.1.6  Operational Definitions
The potential metrics were developed to help to ensure the CTS criteria 
could be met. The voice of process (VOP) matrix (Figure  13.13) summa-
rizes and relates the CTS, process factors that impact the CTS, the opera-
tional definition, metrics, and proposed targets. The operational definitions 
describe how you would specifically measure the metrics that relate to the 
CTS. To assess a timely process, we will track that the Area Council review 
is held when scheduled, and the project charters that are scheduled are

reviewed during the session. The target is that 100% of the project charters 
are reviewed when scheduled.
To assess that a high-quality process with metrics is in place, we developed 
two initiation scorecards: one to assess the format, and the other to assess the 
quality of the content. The format initiation scorecard verifies every required 
field is completed. The content initiation scorecard ensures that the quality 
of the content in each field meets the standard criteria identified. We used 
the standard project criteria provided by the division and used them to cre-
ate the scorecard for each field of the project charter. For the format, each 
required field was rated as either complete for 1 point, or as a 0 denoting 
a missing field. There were a total of 30 required fields resulting in a total 
number of 30 points. The format percentage was calculated as the total num-
ber of completed fields divided by the total number of points. For example, if 
a person missed completing four fields, and completed 26 of the fields, their 
format percent would be 87% (26/30).

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
For the content scorecard, a Likert-type rating scale was used, with a scale 
from 1 (low quality) to 5 (high quality) for each field. Specific semantic defi-
nitions were developed for the ratings of 1, 3, and 5. The 2 and 4 ratings are 
included to allow a rating between the other ratings when the field entry 
does not quite meet the next higher rating, or the next lowest. There was a 
total of five points for each field, 1 being the low rating and 5 being the high-
est rating. There were 12 different fields that were assessed for the content. A 
perfect content project charter would get a total number of content points of 
60, for 100% content. If someone received a three rating on one of the fields, 
and 5 on all of the others, a total number of points received on the content 
scorecard would be 58, for a content percentage of 97% (58/60).
The scorecard criteria will be discussed next. The most important fields on 
the project charter will be discussed along with the criteria for each.
13.4.1.7  Business Opportunity

The assumptions are factors considered to be true without demonstration of 
proof that could impact the outcome of the project.
13.4.1.12.1  Assumptions Scorecard Criteria
Format: This is a required field and must be entered.
Content: The following criteria were used to assess the assumptions.
	
1.	No assumptions identified
	
2.	Somewhat previous answer, but not quite next answer
	
3.	Identifies prioritization, resource, or budget assumptions only.
	
4.	Somewhat next answer, but not quite previous answer
	
5.	Identifies factors considered to be true (without demonstration of 
proof) that could impact the outcome of the project.
The concept of the initiation scorecards is to help the project charter authors 
better understand the criteria for a high-quality project charter, as well as to 
be used to assess the quality of the charters by the Area Council. Because 
the measurement against the scorecard criteria can be somewhat subjective, 
we only use one person to evaluate the quality of the project charters, until 
we can train others to consistently score the project charters. We would then 
perform a Gauge R&R (Repeatability and Reproducibility) study to assess 
the consistency of the measurement system.
13.4.2  Design Phase Presentation

13.5.2  Optimize Phase
13.5.2.1  Optimize Report
Following is a written report of the Optimize phase for the project charter 
review process design project, including the key deliverables developed as 
part of the prior exercises.
The Optimize phase of the IDDOV process is designed to implement the 
designed process, and then optimize the design by error proofing and fur-
ther improving the process by seeing what worked and what did not. The 
main activities of this phase are as follows: implement process, assess pro-
cess capabilities, and optimize design.

Project Charter Review Process Design
13.5.2.2  Implementation Plan
The team reviewed the process map and procedures with key stake-
holders to ensure it met their needs, and aligned with the divisional 
standards. They then developed an implementation plan, as shown in 
Figure  13.14. The team also developed a detailed communication plan, 
shown in Figure 13.15, so they could effectively reach all of the stakehold-
ers so they could understand the new project charter review process. The 
newly designed process was implemented at the end of February by noti-
fying the entire area through an e-mail with the new process map and 
detailed procedure. The VPs and directors also communicated the new 
process to the development teams in their staff meetings and town hall 
meetings. The first Area Council was held on March 4. The process and 
metrics team gathered input from the stakeholders, and also held some 
focus groups to understand any issues and to collect improvement ideas 
regarding the process.
13.5.2.3  Statistical Process Control
Statistical process control was used to monitor the content and format score-
cards by applying a p-chart. The control chart for the first 3 months of for-
mat data is shown in Figure 13.16. The format chart for the first 3 months of 
content data is shown in Figure 13.17. There were many out-of-control points, 
especially in the first month that the review was running.
13.5.2.4  Process Capability
When we implemented the process, we first baselined the process for the 
scorecard metrics related to the format and content of the project char-
ter. Figure  13.18 shows the baseline format scorecard percentage of 86%. 
Figure 13.19 shows the baseline content scorecard percentage of 79%.
The process capability was assessed after 3 months to have enough data 
available for an adequate sample size. The initiation scorecard metrics were 
tracked with each area review to assess improvement from a format and

placed on a control chart for the first 3 months’ worth of data. Assignable 
causes were either lack of training, or new project leaders were creating

for the project charter format is 95%, and the process capability for the project 
charter content is 96%. This equates to a sigma level of about 3.2 to 3.3 sigma, 
still much room for improvement if Six Sigma is our stretch goal. The 3-month 
target for the format was 100%, so we were still shy of the target for filling 
out all of the required fields on the project charter. The 3-month target for the 
content was 80%, and we have far exceeded the scorecard content target with 
the process capability of 96%. There is still additional room for improvement 
related to the project leaders completing all of the required fields.
13.5.2.5  Revised Process Map
We held additional focus groups with the development team stakeholders to 
understand what worked with the process and what could be improved. We 
met with the authors of the project charter and project leaders responsible 
for ensuring that the project charters were reviewed by the Area Council. 
There were several elements of the process that the focus group attendees 
liked as follows:
•	 The visibility and action items provided by the process and the 
SharePoint site
•	 The set deadlines and process consistency
•	 The ability to have input into the process
•	 Being able to plan the review schedules better
•	 The scorecard helping you to think through the criteria required on 
the project charter before sending it on for review (This comment 
was given by someone who received a perfect project charter score 
the first time she ever wrote a project charter.)
Some of the improvement ideas from the focus group attendees were as follows:
•	 Would like to have the scorecard feedback to the authors.
•	 They are not clear on who is supposed to do what.
•	 SharePoint navigation is confusing.
•	 What documents must be attached to the SharePoint?
•	 Not clear on the review process.
•	 Challenging to coordinate the functional team reviews with the 
Area Council review. Timing of the review is difficult (only first and 
third Tuesdays).
We revised the process to include the following changes:
•	 In the functional review, we changed the wording from approve to 
“OK?” to clarify when the project charter is officially approved.

380
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
•	 We combined the format and content scorecard into one document, 
but kept the ability to report the scores separately. The initial plan 
was to eventually eliminate the format scorecard when everyone 
was trained to complete the project charter; however, because the 
format percentage has not reached the target, we combined the two 
scorecards for ease of entry but still report on both scores.
•	 We changed the criteria for the projects that had to also be reviewed 
in the division’s project council to reduce the number of projects that 
had to be reviewed three different times, down to only twice.
•	 We moved the due date earlier to better accommodate the volume of 
project charters that needed to be reviewed.
•	 We eliminated the need to attach the project charter on the 
SharePoint site, requiring them to only be uploaded to the project 
management repository.
•	 We started to provide the project scorecard feedback directly to the 
authors. For perfect project charters, we send an e-mail to the project 
charter author, the project lead, the author’s manager, the director, 
and the VP to share the good news.
•	 We are tracking the perfect project charters and share those with the 
management team at the Area Council review.
•	 We created a project charter workshop and started training project 
charter authors to further enhance the quality of the project charters.
A revised process map incorporating many of the improvement recommen-
dations is shown in Figure 13.22.
13.5.2.6  Training Plans, Procedures
We developed the project charter workshops, and started training with the 
business analysts on the development teams, who create a large number 
of the project charters. The initial pilot workshop went extremely well. We 
incorporated suggestions for the workshop to improve the workshop mate-
rial. We revised the procedures with the revised process ideas.

Validate Report: Create a Validate phase report, including your findings, 
results, and conclusions of the Validate phase.
Dashboards/Scorecards: Create a dashboard or scorecard for tracking and 
controlling the process.
Mistake Proofing: Create a mistake-proofing plan to prevent errors from 
occurring in the process.
Hypothesis Testing/Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Using the data in the 
“Project Review Data.xls” spreadsheet, perform the appropriate 
hypothesis test or ANOVA to compare the scorecard quality between 
the vice presidents to determine if there is a difference in scorecard 
quality between the VP areas.
Replication Opportunities: Identify some potential replication opportu-
nities within or outside the division to apply the same or a similar 
process.
Validate Phase Presentation: Prepare a presentation (PowerPoint) from 
the case study exercises that provides a short (10 to 15 minutes) oral 
presentation of the Validate phase deliverables and findings.

13.6.2.1  Validate Report
Following is a written report of the Validate phase for the project charter 
review process design project, including the key deliverables developed as 
part of the prior exercises.
The purpose of the Validate phase of the IDDOV process is to design, 
develop, and incorporate controls into the improved processes. The main 
activities of this phase are to validate process; assess performance, failure 
modes, and risks; and iterate design and finalize.

384
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
13.6.2.2  Dashboards/Scorecards
The dashboard that is reviewed with management at the start of each Area 
Council review is shown in Figure 13.23. It shows the initial baseline per-
cent for the format and content scorecard, and the current percentage for 
the project charters reviewed in the current Area Council cycle, as well as 
the overall improvement since the baseline. The dashboard also shows the 
total number of perfect project charters, those that received 100% on both the 
format and content.
13.6.2.3  Mistake Proofing
To further mistake-proof the process, we developed the following error-
proofing ideas:
•	 Once the project charter author creates the item on the SharePoint, 
send him or her an e-mail if he or she did not create the scorecard, 
and encourage the author to revise the project charter based on the 
scorecard feedback. This can help to improve the project charter 
before the Area Council review.
•	 Place a notice on the SharePoint and send an e-mail to notify everyone 
of the due date so the authors do not submit the project charters late.
•	 Provide additional project charter workshop training to prevent 
project charter errors.
•	 We asked for a program identifier field to be added to the project 
charter to more easily identify when a project should be associated 
with a program.
•	 We added navigational information directions on the SharePoint to 
reduce confusion identified in the focus group.
13.6.2.4  Hypothesis Testing/Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
13.6.2.4.1  Hypothesis Testing Between Vice President Areas
After the first 3 months of running the process, we wanted to determine if 
there was a difference in the project charter format and content scores by 
Format: All fields complete
•	Baseline: 86.3%; 96.51% (+10.23%)
Content: Meaningful entries in fields
•	Baseline: 79.3%; 93.73% (+14.41%)
Number Total Perfect Project Charters: 18

the vice presidents’ areas, because our VPs are naturally competitive. We 
first needed to assess whether the format and content scores were normally 
distributed to determine which statistical test should be used to compare the 
scores across the VP areas. If the distributions were normal, we could use 
an ANOVA test; if not we would need to use a nonparametric test such as 
Kruskal-Wallis or Mood’s Median tests.
We performed a normality test in Minitab®, with the null hypothesis being 
that the data are normal. We received a p-value of .005 for the both the for-
mat and content scores. If p is low, the null hypothesis must be rejected. We 
rejected the null hypothesis and concluded we do not have a normal distri-
bution for the format or the content scores. The histograms for the data are 
shown in Figures 13.24 and 13.25.
We next tested whether the variances were equal using the Levene’s test 
for the format and scorecard data. The p-value for the format scores was 
.882, and for the content scores was .724, so we failed to reject the null 
hypothesis and concluded the variances are equal. We then performed 
a Mood Median test because it handles outliers better than the Kruskal-
Wallis test to test where the median format and content scores are differ-
ent across the different VP areas. For the format scores, the P-value was 
.450, so we failed to reject the null hypothesis and concluded the medians 
were not significantly different. The medians for each of the VP areas were 
29 out of 30 on the format scorecards. The Minitab results are shown in 
Figure 13.26.

For the content scores, the P-value was .228, so we did not reject the null 
hypothesis and concluded the content scores are not significantly different 
across the VP areas. The overall median was 56 out of 60 on the content 
scorecard. The Minitab results are shown in Figure 13.27.
13.6.2.4.2  Hypothesis Tests from Initial Baseline Results
We wanted to understand if there was an improvement in the format and 
content scores 3 months after the process was optimized and implemented.
Format Scorecard: We first tested if the variances between the baseline 
and the more recent scores were equal with a Levene’s test. With a 
null hypothesis that the variances are equal and a p-value of .107, 
we failed to reject the null hypothesis and concluded the variances 
are equal. We then performed a Mann-Whitney test to determine if 
there was a difference between the baseline and later format scores. 
The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the 
baseline and the last 2 months of Area Council results. The conclu-
sion was that the test is significant at 0, so we concluded there is a 
difference between the baseline format median score (26.5) and the 
last 2 months of results (30.0), showing a significant improvement 
in the format scorecard results. The Minitab results are shown in 
Figure 13.28.
Content Scorecard: We tested if the variances were equal with a Levene’s 
test. With a null hypothesis that the variances were equal and a 
p-value of .235, we failed to reject the null hypothesis and concluded 
the variances were equal. We then performed a Mann-Whitney test

to assess if there was a difference in the content scores between the 
baseline period and the last 2 months. The null hypothesis was that 
there was no difference between the baseline and the last 2 months 
of Area Council results.
The test was significant at 0, so we concluded there was a difference 
between the baseline median content score (48) and the last 2 months 
(57), showing a significant improvement in the format scorecard 
results. The Minitab results are shown in Figure 13.29.
We optimized and validated our new project charter review process.
13.6.2.5  Replication Opportunities
The concept of incorporating the content and format scorecards would be 
very effective in any similar process, where there is great value in clearly 
defining and measuring against specific criteria for qualitative information. 
This encourages assessing knowledge processes, where knowledge is elic-
ited and presented to gain approval to move forward on an information 
systems project.
This particular Area Council review process and procedures were also 
adopted in the other senior vice presidents’ areas in the division.

Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
14.1  Project Overview
Accounting firms provide financial services, such as bookkeeping, tax 
returns, and audit services. Unfortunately, employees sometimes encoun-
ter problems with information technology (IT) systems that interrupt their 
work. While the IT department is responsible for fixing these problems, their 
ability to do so is often hindered by the lack of a formal IT change man-
agement system. Such a system would improve the timely identification of 
prior changes to IT systems that may be related to current problems faced 
by the IT department, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and IT staff 
frustration. This work describes a case study that used the Design for Six 
Sigma (DFSS) methodology to establish a process for effectively managing 
IT system changes for a mid-size accounting firm. This structured design 
approach provided an underlying framework for this organization to trans-
late users’ needs/expectations into the design of a new system that helped 
to improve the communication and awareness of system changes within the 
IT department.
The purpose of this project is to apply DFSS within a small IT department 
at a mid-size accounting firm. This case specifically demonstrates how the 
five-phase DFSS methodology, known as IDDOV (Identify-Define-Design-
Optimize-Verify), was used as an underlying framework to establish an IT 
change management process for this department. Change management is the 
process responsible for controlling and managing requests to change aspects 
of the IT infrastructure or service and includes activities such as software 
upgrades, server migrations, data moves and deletions, alterations to file 
permissions, and the creation and modifications of user accounts. When this 
project began, the department’s approach to managing IT system changes 
was very informal and ineffective. IT staff simply communicated changes to 
one another verbally or through e-mail. As a result, changes were often not 
communicated well or were not acknowledged by others. Hence, the lack of a 
formally defined IT change management system meant there was no way to 
determine what system changes had been made that may be responsible for 
future problems faced by the IT department. The next section describes the 
company and department in which this case study was conducted as well 
as the motivation for undertaking the DFSS project. The work completed in 
each phase of the project is then explained in detail.
The IT department within this organization supports the firm by ensur-
ing that critical software applications and necessary equipment are available 
and functioning properly so that employees can complete their work tasks. 
Unfortunately, employees sometimes encounter problems with IT systems 
that hinder the daily productivity of the organization. When the necessary 
IT systems are not available, it interrupts the flow of work for employees, 
thereby potentially causing a loss of revenue. It is the responsibility of the 
IT department to maintain these systems and fix these problems. This 

393
Information Technology (IT) System Changes
department is small and consists of only four employees—two IT staff, one 
external consultant, and the IT manager, who reports directly to the manag-
ing partner of the firm. At the time of this case study, the IT department iden-
tified unplanned IT system downtime as one of their major opportunities for 
improvement. They felt strongly that their ability to address problems that 
cause downtime was hindered by the lack of a formal IT change manage-
ment system within their department.
14.2  Identify Phase
14.2.1  Identify Phase Activities
	
1.	Develop Project Charter: Use the information provided in the Project 
Overview section to develop a project charter for the DFSS project.
	
2.	Establish Team Ground Rules and Roles: Establish the project team’s 
ground rules and team members’ roles.
	
3.	Develop Project Plan: Develop your team’s project plan for the DFSS 
project.
14.2.2  Identify
14.2.2.1  Project Charter
The first step was to develop a project charter.
Project Name: IT Change Management System
Project Overview: Design a process for effectively managing IT system 
changes, which will result in increased productivity and improved 
customer satisfaction.
Problem Statement: The IT department does not have a formal process 
for managing IT system changes, which results in unplanned down-
time, security risks, compliance issues, and frustration for the IT 
staff—all of which negatively impact organizational productivity.
Customer/Stakeholders: All members of the organization
Goal of the Project: Reduce unplanned downtime, improve IT staff 
morale, improve IT security and compliance issues
Scope Statement: The DFSS team will examine and recommend changes 
to the major process steps for the IT change management system. 
The investigation is limited to this process.
Projected Financial Benefit(s): Improved productivity, customer satisfac-
tion, and bottom-line performance

14.2.2.2  Team Ground Rules and Roles
The team informally developed several ground rules for the project:
•	 Conflict Management: All team members will be respectful to the 
other members of the team. All team members will give and receive 
feedback in a professional manner.
•	 Attendance/Tardiness: Weekly meetings will be held and attendees 
are expected to be punctual.
•	 Participation: Participation at weekly meetings is expected unless a 
situation arises where a team member is unable to attend, which 
may be due to illness or an out-of-town trip.
14.2.2.3  Project Plan
A Gantt chart was used to keep the project development cycle on track 
and ensure that all key steps in the process were accomplished. This chart 
includes dates and tasks that are essential for appropriate usage of time 
management during the scheduled period of work.
Also as part of the Identify phase, a project plan was developed. This plan, 
the execution of which is described in the following sections, included the 
following steps:
	
1.	Map the current process using a Suppliers-Input-Process-Output-
Customers (SIPOC) diagram and a service blueprint.
	
2.	Conduct interviews with all IT staff to determine the needs for the 
new process.
	
3.	Organize the needs obtained from interviews using an affinity diagram.
	
4.	Prioritize the needs for the new process through a needs assessment 
survey.
	
5.	Benchmark other organizations to determine initial design ideas.
	
6.	Conduct brainstorming sessions with all IT staff to determine addi-
tional design ideas.
	
7.	Organize preliminary design ideas using an affinity diagram.
	
8.	Determine the requirements for the new process using a needs-
metrics matrix.
	
9.	Establish baseline measurements for process requirements through 
a user survey.
	 10.	Select the best design idea using a concept selection matrix.
	 11.	Pilot test the design of the new process.
	 12.	Determine how well the new process fulfills the needs for which it 
was designed.

395
Information Technology (IT) System Changes
To map the operations within the IT department at a high level, the SIPOC 
diagram shown in Figure 14.2 was created. This diagram shows that the 
work completed by the IT department, which mainly involves maintaining 
systems and fixing problems, directly affects company employees, IT staff, 
and consultants, and indirectly affects the firm’s clients. In essence, the IT 
department provides an internal service within the company to support the 
firm’s overall operations.
To explore the work processes within the IT department in further detail, 
a service blueprint was created for online change requests, as shown in 
Figure  14.3. A service blueprint is a process-oriented design technique

Information Technology (IT) System Changes
intended specifically for documenting and improving service processes 
that is often used in quality improvement projects. This special type of 
process map provides a visual representation of the service process that 
looks somewhat like a swim-lane diagram and denotes the lines of interac-
tion (i.e., where the service provider interacts with the customer), visibility 
(i.e., where the visibility of the service process by the customer ends), and 
internal interaction (i.e., where the behind-the-scenes operations within the 
service process occur). This approach to process mapping specifically dif-
ferentiates between “onstage” (i.e., aspects of the service process that are 
visible to the customer) and “backstage” (i.e., aspects of the service process 
that are not visible to the customer) activities performed by the service pro-
vider, which highlights the customer’s role in the process (Bitner, Ostrom, 
and Morgan, 2008). In this case, the onstage activities performed by the IT 
department include all communications with the users, and the backstage 
activities include researching solutions to problems, evaluating requested 
changes, and testing and installing new hardware and software. In addition, 
the service blueprint shows each point in the process where the employees 
interact with the customer/user (Bitner, Ostrom, and Morgan, 2008). Here, 
the IT staff interacts with users when they work to resolve IT issues, which 
includes developing/pilot testing solutions and training users on new solu-
tions. Mapping these operations helped to organize the collective thinking 
of the design team so that each member had a detailed understanding of the 
work processes involved in this project.
14.2.3  Identify Phase Case Discussion
	
1.	DFSS Project Charter: Review the project charter presented.
	
a.	 A problem statement should include a view of what is going on 
in the business and when it is occurring. The project statement 
should provide data to quantify the problem. Does the prob-
lem statement provide a clear picture of the business problem? 
Rewrite the problem statement to improve it.
	
b.	 The goal statement should describe the project team’s objective 
and be quantifiable, if possible. Rewrite the goal statement to 
improve it.
	
c.	 Did your project charter’s scope differ from the example pro-
vided? How did you assess what was a reasonable scope for your 
project?
	
2.	Project Plan
	
a.	 Discuss how your team developed their project plan and how 
they assigned resources to the tasks. How did the team deter-
mine estimated durations for the work activities?

14.3  Define Phase
14.3.1  Define Phase Activities
	
1.	Obtain the Voice of the Customer (VOC): Interview employees to iden-
tify users’ thoughts regarding the current inventory management 
system (i.e., typical uses, advantages, disadvantages, suggested 
improvements, etc.).
	
2.	Identify Users’ Needs: Translate the information gathered through 
interviews into needs statements (i.e., requirements that the new 
inventory management system should fulfill).
	
3.	Prioritize Needs: Develop a survey and distribute it to users to priori-
tize the needs that the new system should fulfill.
14.3.2  Define
In the Define phase, a user needs analysis was conducted using the approach 
described by Ulrich and Eppinger (2004). The user’s (i.e., employee’s) expec-
tations for an IT change management system were obtained through inter-
views with IT staff, consultants, and other IT system users.
14.3.2.1  Identifying the Voice of the Customer
As shown in Figure 14.4, six employees participated in interviews in which 
they were asked to describe their typical uses, likes, dislikes, and suggested 
improvements regarding the current IT change management process. The 
responses obtained from these interviews were then translated into “needs” 
that an IT change management system should fulfill, as depicted by the 
example interview shown in Figure  14.5. The needs elicited from these 
interviews were then organized into an affinity diagram, as illustrated in

14.3.2.2  Prioritizing Customers’ Needs
To prioritize users’ needs, the information summarized in the affinity diagram 
(Figure 14.6) was used to create a survey, which is displayed in Figure 14.7. 
In this survey, respondents were asked to rate the importance of the needs 
that the IT change management system should fulfill using a five-point scale, 
where a rating of 1 represented “undesirable” and 5 represented “critical.” 
Approximately 14 employees participated in this survey, including the IT 
manager, all IT staff, their consultant, and several employees from outside the 
IT department. The results obtained from the survey, shown in Figure 14.8, 
were analyzed to determine the most important users’ needs, thus identify-
ing the characteristics/features that the new process for managing IT system 
changes should fulfill. Analysis of these data using a chi-square test indi-
cated the importance ratings identified through the survey are different from 
expected values (χ2 = 149.65, p-value = <0.0001).
In terms of the critical to satisfaction (CTS) for this project, the design 
team selected to focus on the 10 needs that received the largest percentage 
of responses in the “highly desirable” and “critical” categories (i.e., ratings 4 
and 5), as shown in Figure 14.8. Figure 14.9 shows the importance weighting 
assigned to these 10 needs based on median survey responses. Focusing on

14.4.2  Design
In the Design phase, brainstorming and benchmarking were used to gen-
erate high-level, potential design ideas. This work involved a total of 11 
interviews, as shown in Figure 14.10, to collect ideas from internal as well 
as external informants in the IT field and beyond. The people interviewed 
included the IT department manager, internal IT staff, and other firm 
employees, as well as IT managers from other firms and users of change 
management systems from other industries, including project managers 
and firefighters. In these interviews, participants were asked to describe the 
methods they use to track and communicate changes/updates, how these 
methods work, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with these 
methods. The information obtained from these interviews was categorized 
in an affinity diagram, which is depicted in Figure 14.11. This diagram was 
then presented to the IT staff as part of a focus group in which this informa-
tion was discussed, design ideas were further refined, and the team reached 
agreement about specific design ideas that should be incorporated into the 
detailed design of the new process for managing IT system changes. These 
elements are highlighted by bold boxes in Figure 14.11.

besides brainstorming and benchmarking could have been used to 
generate potential design ideas?
	
2.	What is the value of using an affinity diagram to organize potential 
design ideas?
	
3.	How did you create your preliminary, high-level design?
14.5  Optimize Phase
14.5.1  Optimize Phase Activities
	
1.	Identify critical to process (CTP) requirements: The design team estab-
lished the technical requirements that the system must fulfill in 
order to address the users’ needs.
	
2.	Select the design concept: Various design concepts were assessed 
against the CTPs using a concept selection matrix to identify the best 
design idea.
14.5.2  Optimize
The design phase of this project focused on developing a detailed design for 
the new IT change management system. The design team first developed 
a general structure, illustrated in Figure 14.12, for the critical elements to 
be addressed by the new process for managing IT system changes. This 
framework included developing policies and procedures, addressing com-
munication requirements, addressing documentation requirements, and 
utilizing software to facilitate operations. The design team felt that the poli-
cies and procedures were important because they would dictate the terms 
of use for the new system. In addition, they believed the other elements 
included in this framework were essential for guiding the daily operations 
of the new system.
In this phase, the design team focused on identifying the specific require-
ments or CTPs that the new process needed to address. These are given in the 
needs-metrics matrix shown in Figure 14.13. Much like what is done in qual-
ity function deployment (QFD) within the House of Quality (Hauser and 
Clausing, 1988), the dots in Figure 14.13 indicate which needs are addressed 
by each design requirement. Special attention was given to ensure that each 
CTS is addressed by at least one CTP. In addition, the importance, units, 
and baseline measurement for each metric are specified in Figure 14.14. The 
importance of the CTPs was determined based on the importance of the 

406
Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development
needs they address. The units selected for each metric reflect the appropriate 
measurement method for each design requirement. The baseline measure-
ments were also documented to establish a record of the current state of the 
process before the new system was implemented. Metrics such as “time to 
document a change” and “time to find information” do not have baseline 
measurements, because at the time, there was no formal system to document 
this information within the IT department. Subjective metrics, like “system 
ease-of-use” and “system effectiveness,” were measured through an addi-
tional user survey (see Figure 14.15) using a five-point scale, where a rating 
of 1 represented “falls well short of expectations” and 5 represented “greatly 
exceeds expectations.” This survey was administered to all IT department 
staff, and the values recorded for the baseline measurement for the remain-
ing metrics were the median rating obtained from the survey and documen-
tation of other aspects of the current system.
Finally, a concept selection matrix was used to select the “best” design con-
cept. As shown in Figure 14.16, the design concepts developed through the 
analyze phase of this project (i.e., software packages, etc.) are listed across 
the top of the matrix, and the criteria by which each concept was judged (i.e., 
design requirements/CTPs) are listed down the leftmost column. One addi-
tional selection criterion, “easy to implement,” was included to ensure that 
solutions requiring significant behavioral changes or additional expenses 
were properly accounted for in this analysis. In this evaluation, each design

concept was rated by the design team using a three-point scale, where a rat-
ing of 1 represented “will not meet need,” 2 represented “will fulfill need,” 
and 3 represented “will exceed expectations for need.”
The design concept with the highest score in the selection matrix was the cur-
rent Help Desk software; hence, the design team decided to use this software 
package to implement the new IT change management system. Even though 
the Help Desk software had been used for some time in the IT department, it

is important to note that the change management functions within this soft-
ware package had not previously been used. As part of the detailed design, 
the team also decided to continue their biweekly meetings to communicate 
and discuss changes, maintain network and application documentation in the 
firm’s Document Management software, and establish policies and procedures 
for the new IT change management process, which included
	
1.	The IT change management system shall be used for all changes that 
affect production systems.
	
2.	All IT staff will:
	
a.	 Use the change management system
	
b.	 Keep documentation of changes up-to-date
	
3.	Policy compliance audits shall be conducted periodically by the IT 
manager as well as IT staff (i.e., peer reviews).
Once created, the detailed design was tested through a 2-week pilot study in the 
IT department. At the conclusion of this pilot test, additional interviews/focus 
groups were conducted to ensure the design fulfilled the needs of the IT depart-
ment. Slight adjustments were made based on the results of the pilot study in 
order to create the final design of the new IT change management system.

3.	Develop a control plan: Establish a way to maintain the improvements 
achieved through the project.
14.6.2  Verify
Once the final design of the new process for managing IT system changes 
had been in use for approximately 3 months, several measurements were 
taken to evaluate whether the new system fulfilled the needs for which it 
was designed. As shown in Figure 14.17, various aspects built into the new 
system were documented and compared against baseline measurements 
to acknowledge the degree of improvement achieved by the new system. 
Specifically, the “time to document a change” and “time to find informa-
tion” were determined through several observations of IT department staff 
using the new system. On average, it now takes 1.65 minutes to document 
a change and just 9 seconds to find the information they need within the 
new IT change management system. In terms of “system ease-of-use” and 
“system effectiveness,” again these aspects were measured through a user 
survey, similar to that shown in Figure 14.15, however it asked IT depart-
ment staff to indicate how well the “new” system met expectations relative to 
fulfilling the requirements of ease-of-use and effectiveness—both of which 
were rated higher for the new system compared to the previous system.
For comparison purposes, survey responses regarding “system ease-of-
use” for the previous system versus the new system are shown in Figure 14.18. 
Chi-square analysis was used to examine proportional changes in ease-of-
use ratings between these systems. As shown in Figure 14.19, changes in the 
IT department staffs’ ratings of ease-of-use for the previous system versus

the new system were significant (p-value = 0.0183). Figure 14.20 illustrates 
survey responses for “system effectiveness” for the two systems. Again, chi-
square analysis (see Figure 14.21) indicates that changes in IT department 
staffs’ ratings of system effectiveness were significant (p-value = 0.0460). In 
other words, there is some evidence to suggest that the new system had a 
positive impact on improving system ease-of-use and effectiveness.
To maintain the improvements achieved through this project, the design 
team developed a control plan for the IT department/company that consists 
of documentation, training, and system monitoring. The instructions for 
using the new IT change management system were documented in standard 
operating procedures. The new policies for the change management process 
described previously were incorporated into the company’s Information 
Technology Infrastructure Protection and Security Policy. All IT department 
staff, along with other employees involved in the change approval process, 
were trained on these new policies and procedures. As new employees are 
hired, this information will be covered as part of their new-hire training 
program. In addition, the use of the new system will be monitored by the IT

14.7  Summary
The work completed in this project illustrates the effective use of the DFSS 
methodology to create an IT change management system in a mid-sized 
accounting firm. By using the IDDOV process and associated tools, users’ 
needs were identified and a new process was established that effectively ful-
filled the needs of the work environment for which it was designed. The use 
of this structured design approach achieved several positive outcomes for 
the organization overall and for the IT department, specifically.
Throughout the DFSS process, all members of the IT department worked 
together closely to improve the communication of system changes. Because 
the IT staff are the users of the new system and they helped to design it (i.e., 
their needs and ideas were considered and integrated into the final design), 
little to no resistance to using the new system was encountered during 
implementation. Hence, the new change management system has become an 
integral part of the daily work processes of the IT department.
Several months after implementation, the new change management sys-
tem continues to be successfully used by the entire IT department, includ-
ing their external consultant. The driving force for creating this new system 
was to stabilize the IT environment for the company. By enhancing com-
munication between all the members of the IT department, providing an 
approval process for network changes, and maintaining documentation of 
what changes were made when and by whom, the new change management 
system has enabled the IT department to reduce overall network downtime 
and accelerate resolution time of network issues.
The successful implementation of a complete design solution has led to 
the effective management of changes within the IT department. This new

process specifically helped to improve the communication of changes, 
awareness about changes, and the timely identification of prior changes that 
may be related to current problems faced by the IT department. As a result, 
the new system has had a positive impact on reducing unplanned downtime 
and IT staff frustration, as well as improving productivity and customer sat-
isfaction for the organization as a whole. Based on the success of this project, 
the IT department is now looking at additional ways to further improve the 
service they provide to their customers.

The Future and Challenges of 
Design for Six Sigma
Elizabeth Cudney and Sandra Furterer
This book provided an overview of the Design for Six Sigma methodol-
ogy, the Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) methodol-
ogy, and real-world product and service-oriented case studies applying 
these methods and tools. This last chapter describes a view into the future 
with the attempt to project where Design for Six Sigma will evolve over 
the next decade.
15.1  Applying Lean Methods and Tools to Streamline 
the Design and Development Life Cycle
Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is a compilation of several diverse methods and 
tools that provide a more holistic and integrated toolkit for designing and devel-
oping products and services. As new products and services become increasingly 
complex and multifaceted, it is necessary to more tightly couple and integrate 
the entire service and product development process with lean design.
A comprehensive methodology is necessary to design a product (appli-
cation), process, or service right the first time. DFSS is a data-driven qual-
ity strategy for designing products and services. Design typically accounts 
for 70% of the cost of the product, and 80% of quality problems are unwit-
tingly designed into the product (application), process, or service. Therefore,

one-third of the budget must be devoted to correcting the problems they 
plan to create with the first two-thirds of the budget.
The three aspects of improving the product development process include
	
1.	Maximize profitability
	
2.	Minimize time
	
3.	Minimize cost
This must be balanced without compromising value from the customer’s 
perspective.
Lean design/product development aids in identifying and reducing or 
eliminating waste in the product development process. Lean design focuses 
on removing waste from all aspects of the product and associated devel-
opment process before the start of manufacture. Lean design addresses the 
entire life cycle of a product. More specifically, lean design targets cutting 
manufacturing costs during the design cycle and accelerating the time-to-
market. Kearney (2003) identified the most common forms of waste in prod-
uct design as shown in Figure 15.1.
Mascitelli (2004) developed five principles of lean design:
Principle 1: Precisely define the customer’s problem and identify the 
specific functions that must be performed to solve that problem.
Principle 2: Identify the fastest process by which the identified functions 
can be integrated into a high-quality, low-cost product.
Principle 3: Strip away any unnecessary or redundant cost items to reveal 
the optimal product solution.

Principle 4: Listen to the voice of the customer frequently and iteratively 
throughout the development process.
Principle 5: Embed cost-reduction tools and methods into both your 
business practices and your culture to enable cost reduction.
Key areas of waste in product design stem from process delays, design 
reuse, defects, and process efficiency. Process delays are caused from 
time lost looking for information, waiting for test results, and waiting 
for feedback. Waste from design reuse is due to not learning from past 
design experiences, not reducing unnecessary features, and designs that 
are never used, completed, or delivered. Defect wastes stem from poor 
designs and warranty issues. Finally, process efficiency waste is caused 
from underutilization of design knowledge and not validating manufac-
turing errors early.
There are several ways to decrease costs in the design cycle by reduc-
ing direct material cost, direct labor cost, operational overhead, nonrecur-
ring design cost, and product-specific capital investments. Direct material 
costs can be reduced by using common parts, design simplification, defect 
reduction, and parts-count reduction. Direct labor costs can be reduced 
through design simplification, design for manufacture and assembly, 
and standardizing processes. Operational overhead can be reduced 
by increasing the utilization of shared capital equipment and modular 
design. Nonrecurring design costs can be decreased by standardization, 
value engineering, and platform design strategies. Product-specific capital 
investments can be minimized by using value engineering, part standard-
ization, and one-piece flow.
Huthwaite (2004) developed five laws of lean design:
	
1.	Law of Strategic Value: Ensure you are delivering value to all stake-
holders during the product’s life cycle.
	
2.	Law of Waste Prevention: Prevent waste in all aspects of the product’s 
life.
	
3.	Law of Marketplace Pull: Anticipate change in order to deliver the 
right products at the right time.
	
4.	Law of Innovation Flow: Create new ideas to delight customers and 
differentiate your product.
	
5.	Law of Last Feedback: Use predictive feedback to forecast cause-
and-effect relationships.
By incorporating lean principles into the Design for Six Sigma methodology, 
further improvements can be made to the design of a product or service. 
The product development process can be shortened bringing the product to 
market faster while still ensuring value to the customer.

15.2  Adapting Enterprise Business Architecture Modeling 
to Product, Service, and Process Design
With the complexity of products, processes, and technology that impact 
design decisions, Enterprise Business Architecture modeling can be applied 
in the future to product and process design as it has been applied to the 
information system development and design life cycle. Enterprise archi-
tecture (EA), also referred to as business architecture (BA) is a relatively 
recent body of knowledge that comes out of the information systems realm 
(Bieberstein, Laird, Jones, and Mitra, 2008). Enterprise architecture can 
provide an enterprise-wide understanding of the business. It attempts to 
connect the business strategies to planned change initiatives focusing on 
information technology (IT) projects that can provide tactics to meet the 
business strategies. In many organizations, the business architecture is 
documented and developed by the IT organization as a way to understand 
the business processes. The business processes enable the extraction of key 
business elements that support required capabilities of the business to meet 
customers’ needs. This provides traceability from the businesses’ strate-
gies, to the business requirements, through to the implemented informa-
tion technology. Demonstrating the alignment between IT initiatives and 
the business strategies helps to ensure that resources of people, time, and 
money are applied appropriately.
Business architecture modeling techniques and methods can be used to 
also provide prioritized alignment with the key strategic initiatives related 
to design of new products, services, and processes in an enterprise. This can 
provide alignment between the business strategies and goals and the organi-
zation’s new product and service development initiatives and goals.
Business architecture helps us to understand the 3- to 5-year strategies of 
the business. Business architecture provides models that describe the busi-
ness entities (business processes and relevant business information), their 
relationships, dynamics, and rules that govern their interaction to achieve 
enterprise-wide objectives. These same modeling techniques can be used to 
understand the key strategic initiatives, the products, services, and processes 
that can be designed to meet the organization’s strategic plans, and identify 
the customer requirements that are met through the product and service 
designs. The modeling can identify the business capabilities and processes 
that provide the products and services, linking manufacturing and service 
processes to the key design decisions.
The elements of the business architecture describe the business enterprise, 
shown in Figure 15.2 (Furterer, 2011). The business architecture first includes 
understanding the customers and their needs and expectations. From a prod-
uct or service design, we can capture the customer needs for the new product 
or service. Next we capture and document the business strategies and goals, 

419
The Future and Challenges of Design for Six Sigma
as well as the external and internal influencers on the business. The relation-
ship between the business goals and the business capabilities that support 
the goals should be understood. We use the value chain showing a chain of 
activities that provide value to the customer (Porter, 1985) to understand and 
decompose our processes that help us to meet the new product or service 
designs. The functional decomposition provides a hierarchical organization 
of functions and the processes that they include. Each value chain and the 
subsequent business functions will be used to further decompose the pro-
cesses. This ensures traceability from the value chains to business processes 
that provide customer value.
The functional decomposition could be used in product design to decom-
pose and relate the conceptual design customers’ requirements to the techni-
cal product requirements that meet the customers’ needs.
The business capabilities enable the business functions. While the way in 
which a business implements its processes is likely to change frequently, the 
basic capabilities of a business tend to remain constant. The business pro-
cesses and their activities describe the sequence of activities that enable the 
business to meet the customer’s expectations and provide value through the 
value chains.
The business components are identified to optimize the activities that sup-
port the business. These components consist of the activities that require 
similar people, processes, and technologies. They allow the standardization 
of the business processes by componentizing the activities that can be used

in multiple areas of the business, across many business units and markets 
(IBM Corporation, 2005).
In product design, the business components could become the product 
components or even bill of materials that meet the design.
The domain concepts describe the information and roles that exist in the 
business, that are part of the business processes. The domain conceptual 
model in product design could describe the product specifications and iden-
tify the materials, components, and specifications required in the design of 
the product.
Incorporating knowledge, methods, and tools from the lean body of 
knowledge and enterprise business architecture can help us to simplify and 
deal with the natural growing complexities of product, service, and process 
design in the future world that we face. You can be part of the journey to 
enhance product, service, and process design through application of these 
bodies of knowledge.

Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering
Real-world examples and hands-on experience are invaluable resources 
when learning how to use new methods and tools, whether in training or in 
a classroom. Yet there are very few books on Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) 
that provide the practical knowledge required to be up and running quickly. 
Until now. Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development: 
Applications and Case Studies provides step-by-step analysis and practical 
guidance on how to apply DFSS in product and service development. 
The book discusses the DFSS roadmap and how it is linked to methodologies, 
including organizational leadership, product development, system integration, 
critical parameter management, voice of the customer, quality function 
deployment, and concept generation. The chapter authors provide real-world 
case studies that demonstrate how the application of DFSS has significantly 
improved meeting customer requirements. They follow the Identify-Define-
Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) structure for new product or service 
development. Examples of tools covered include Quality Function Deployment, 
Voice of the Customer, Pugh Concept Selection, Ideal Function, Failure Modes 
and Effects Analysis, Reliability, Measurement Systems Analysis, Regression 
Analysis, and Capability Studies, among others. 
Clearly outlining the tools and how to integrate them for robust product 
and service design, the case studies can be used by industry professionals 
and academics to learn how to apply DFSS. The book gives you hands-on 
experience in a safe environment, where experienced Black Belts and Master 
Black Belts act as mentors and prepare you to touch actual data and make 
decisions when embarking on real-world projects. Even after you’ve mastered 
the techniques, the breadth and depth of coverage contained in this book will 
make it a vital part of your toolkit.
