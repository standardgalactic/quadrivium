About the Author
Darrin Perez (1988–) was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and currently resides in Puerto 
Rico. His debut fantasy novel, Whispers of Dawn, was written as a self-imposed challenge 
in the spirit of NaNoWriMo (National November Writing Month). He has also written 
many video game–related articles for HubPages and published an e-book concerning 
RPG Maker VX Ace (a video game development engine), which was later expanded and 
published by Apress under the title Beginning RPG Maker VX Ace. His latest nonfiction 
work, the second edition of Make a 2D RPG in a Weekend (written to cover creating a 
game in RPG Maker MV), is his third book to be published by Apress.

About the Technical 
Reviewer
Michael Lin is an experienced RPG Maker developer and has created scripts for RPG 
Maker VX Ace since 2012. He is the founder of HimeWorks, a web site dedicated to 
resources for RPG Maker, which includes a wealth of scripts and tutorials on game 
development and programming.

Acknowledgments
The story of this book begins about the time that I was finishing Beginning RPG Maker 
VX Ace in late 2014. Ben Renow-Clarke expressed interest in my writing a second book 
concerning the engine, a book a reader could follow through and finish within a single 
weekend. I immediately rose to the challenge and decided that the simplest type of 
game to make within the engine would be a dungeon crawler. It was then that I began 
to create the game and write the book in parallel. Afterward, we iterated upon the work, 
editing, formatting, and proofreading it to the levels of quality that Apress is known for. I 
have always enjoyed a good dungeon crawler. While they tend to be among the simplest 
role-playing games, there’s also a chance to inject a surprising amount of complexity into 
them. This newly updated second edition was also a challenge, for different reasons. This 
time, the challenge stemmed from meeting a strict deadline while remaking the entire 
game originally created in RPG Maker VX Ace for RPG Maker MV, the newest version of 
the software developed by Kadokawa Games. Differences in event and code handling 
caused me no end of grief but, as you are now reading, this book is complete! In any case, 
that’s enough about the book. You’ll get to read it soon enough! 
As is proper for the section, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of everyone at 
Apress who has worked with me, especially Ben Renow-Clarke, who ignited the spark 
that led to my writing the first edition of this book and updating it for MV, and Christine 
Ricketts, who served as the coordinating editor—the glue that binds the project together, 
if you will, for the first edition of this book. Honorable mention goes to the following 
people for making the first edition a reality. Without their aid, the foundations for the 
creation of this second edition would not have existed: Michael G. Laraque (copy editor) 
and Dhaneesh Kumar (formatting and composition). It is safe to say that, without the 
efforts of those working at Apress, this book would not be in your hands.
Michael Lin served as the technical reviewer for the first edition of this book, and I 
am always appreciative of his aid to make this effort the best it can be. He is quite the font 
of knowledge when it comes to RPG Maker VX Ace (RMVXA) and Ruby, and he is quick to 
catch any inefficiencies in event code and scripts alike. 
I would like to thank the RPG Maker community as a whole for all that they have 
done to make exploring and using each new version of the engine as easy as humanly 
possible. It has provided countless resources (both in the form of tutorials and other 
essential assets, such as sprites and music). Working with a game-development engine 
can be a daunting task, but the community is always willing to lend a helping hand to 
anyone in needs. It includes far too many people to name, but I hold them dearly in my 
heart.

On a personal note, I would like to thank my parents, Jose Perez and Victoria Diaz, 
who serve as my eternal bulwarks, allowing me to weather things that would otherwise 
break me. My closest friends are always there as well, to lend a hand whenever I need it. 
Finally, I thank you, dear reader. At the end of the day, writers write for their 
audience. While there are many other factors that drive me to write, I can safely concur 
with the general thought that there’s not much of a point in writing if your work is not 
read. Knowledge is not meant to be kept locked within a cabinet but, rather, released 
to the masses! So, get to it, and may you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed 
writing it!

Introduction
Overview
Welcome to Make a 2D RPG in a Weekend! This book will take you through the process 
of using RPG Maker MV (RMMV) to make a six-level dungeon crawler within a single 
weekend. It will explain how to do what is necessary to create the game, so don’t worry if 
you have had no prior RMMV experience. With that said, if you have any prior experience 
with RPG Maker in general and RPG Maker MV specifically, you will have a leg up to work 
on this book. Anyway, let’s move on to the next topic of interest in this introduction.
The Engine of Choice
As already noted, we will be using RMMV to create this game. RMMV, (and a slew of 
related products, while we’re on the subject) can be purchased from the official site at 
www.rpgmakerweb.com.
The exact link to download RMMV is http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/
programs/rpg-maker-mv.
RMMV costs  $79.99, but you can try it for free for 20 days by grabbing the trial 
version. You will be asked for your name and e-mail address, if you attempt to download 
RMMV (whether you pay for it at that time, wait until later, or decide not to keep using the 
product). As it turns out, RPG Maker MV is also compatible with Mac OS X but, as of the 
time of this writing, does not have the luxury of a standalone installer like Windows does 
(which means that you can’t access the MV trial at the moment if you’re using a Mac). 
Kadokawa wants to fix the worst of the Windows version bugs before committing to a 
Mac-version standalone installer. In the meantime, if you’re a Mac user, you can still grab 
MV on Steam for the same price as on the official site.
Source Code Considerations
As you may have already noticed, this book’s source code includes the full game and a 
few other things as well. Among the extras included are a set of blank maps for each of 
the six distinct dungeon levels covered in the book. It is my opinion that mapping is one 
of the more time-consuming aspects of RMMV game design, so I included those maps as 
a shortcut if you want a head-start but don’t want to be completely spoiled. You can see 
the game in its completed state and take as little or as much from it as you want. I merely 
ask that you take the time to go through the book and try to do as much of it as you can on 
your own. Making a game is like most other things in life: practice makes perfect.

■ Introduction

Why Make a Dungeon Crawler?
A dungeon crawler is simple. The simplest dungeon crawlers break the standard 
role-playing game rule (if you will) of requiring a story. You can read some more 
considerations on the subject in the first chapter of this book.
Chapter 10
The book’s final chapter exists outside the challenge posed by this book’s title. It 
proposes some interesting features that you can add to your game after you have officially 
completed it. Depending on your personality, time limits may be stressful, fun, or 
something in between. Thus, I didn’t want you, the reader, to have to race to add to the 
game the extras discussed in Chapter 10.

Chapter 1
Laying Out the Framework
During the course of this chapter, we will be laying out the framework for our weekend 
game. This includes the story line, a general overview of each of our playable characters, 
and the basic foundation of our game’s town. We will be creating the town area, but you 
can also find each of this game’s maps in the book’s source code.
Story
The first objective at hand in the creation of our turn-based, top-down dungeon crawler 
is to lay out our story. While dungeon crawlers are not usually pinnacles of complex 
storytelling, some still have at least a solid framework that carries their players through 
the game. Here are some examples of story lines (or absence thereof) in dungeon crawler 
role-playing video games, in no particular order of complexity.
• 
In Rogue, the classic dungeon crawler that inspired an entire 
genre (roguelikes), the player’s only objective is to survive as long 
as possible. The dungeon is infinitely deep, and there isn’t really a 
lore-related reason for the player’s actions.
• 
In Diablo (technically an action role-playing game [ARPG]), the 
player is an adventurer who arrives at the town of Tristram in an 
attempt to defeat the eponymous villain. Lore books within the 
dungeon lay out the backstory for the game’s setting and context 
for certain areas.
• 
The remakes of the first two Etrian Odyssey games have story 
modes that improve upon the mostly bare-bones plot of their 
original versions. Even so, the basic framework of the plot is as 
follows: the player arrives at a city with a preset mission, plot 
twists happen, and suddenly the stakes have been raised far 
beyond where they started. Eye of the Beholder is a classic PC role-
playing game that has a party of four adventurers trying to find 
and defeat a great evil under the sewers of the city of Waterdeep.
You may have noticed a common thread among most of those descriptions. Mainly, 
the plot in a dungeon crawler is merely an excuse for the player to get into the dungeon 
and play! Even so, that shouldn’t stop you from adding plot to your dungeon crawler, as 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework

desired. Because most of the dungeon crawlers that I have played involve defeating a final 
boss, let’s have one in which the player has to find an artifact hidden within the deepest 
levels of the dungeon. Here’s a succinct blurb for our game’s story line.
You are an adventurer from a faraway land who has arrived at the town of Eagle’s 
Crossing. Legends speak of an ancient artifact buried deep within the town’s catacombs. 
The artifact is said to have the power to heal any wound. Some even claim that it can raise 
the dead. It is owing to the last claim that you have made the arduous journey to the town, 
for you have lost someone dear to you recently.
I bolded the former words for the purpose of mechanics: I plan to have multiple 
playable characters. Thus, in a game, if you have different characters with different 
motivations, it only makes sense that the certain someone be different for each character.
■
■Note  No one ever said you had to reveal who the character has lost. Maybe he/she 
lost multiple beings. Sometimes, the best plots are those that reveal only what is strictly 
necessary.
We’ll honor the age-old tradition of classic dungeon crawlers and have three 
different characters representing classic fantasy archetypes.
• 
Palnor the Warrior: Palnor hails from the highlands directly 
south of the realm’s northern mountains. His town was razed by 
one of the many mountain tribes. He seeks the ancient artifact in 
order to revive his kin and the rest of the people of his town. As a 
Warrior, Palnor has the widest weapon and armor selection of any 
of the three classes of characters, including the unique ability to 
wield two-handed swords and axes and heavy armor. However, he 
cannot master any spells.
• 
Gust the Bandit: Gust used to be as unsavory a character as one 
could imagine, and one most would rather not associate with, 
until the day he laid eyes on the princess of one of the desert clans. 
He swore thereafter to change his ways. However, his past life has 
caught up with him once again. He quests for the ancient artifact 
to revive the one person he has truly loved. As a Bandit, Gust is the 
only character who can use bows. His melee weapon and armor 
selection suffer a bit in comparison to those of the Warrior, but he 
makes up for it with the ability to cast low-level spells.
• 
Feylia the Mage: Graduated at the top of her class in the mystical 
arts, Feylia seeks the ancient artifact to revive her younger 
brother, who was lost in a terrible plague that struck the western 
lands when she was barely of age. As a Mage, Feylia has the worst 
weapon selection of any of the three characters. However, her 
spell book can carry any and all spells that she manages to find 
within the dungeon. A well-equipped Mage is arguably the most 
fit for the dungeon’s deeper levels.

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework

With that out of the way, we pretty much have the skeleton of our plot. About the 
only thing left to do is provide more context to the town of Eagle’s Crossing, as follows.
The town of Eagle’s Crossing was created 411 years ago by a group of trading partners 
who wanted to live away from the various monarchies that would control them. Most 
of the olden kingdoms have since changed their methods of rule, but Eagle’s Crossing 
remains the destination of choice for anyone who wishes to elude the less secluded parts 
of the world. Nestled against a mountainside that was carved out to form the town’s 
catacombs, adventurers are now making their way to Eagle’s Crossing in hopes of finding 
the artifact supposedly hidden within.
There you have it! The impetus for our players to start the game, summarized within 
a single page.
Basic Game Play Considerations
Dungeon crawler RPGs, more than any other type of RPG, live or die on their game play. 
After all, and as we have already demonstrated, you don’t need much of a plot for a 
dungeon crawler. It is imperative, from the very start of your project, to think about what 
type of game play your dungeon crawler game will have. Here are some good questions to 
ask yourself.
• 
Will I use RMMV’s default battle system? There’s nothing wrong 
with using it. Then again, if you want to make a classic dungeon 
crawler, you might want enemies to move on the screen as you’re 
fighting. In that case, you may have to tweak the system a little. 
Mind you, this does not necessarily have to involve heavy scripting.
• 
If I use the default battle system, is it better to use the side view 
or the top-down view? Again, this is a matter of preference. Most 
dungeon crawlers I’ve played either have combat on the same 
map where exploration occurs (such as in Diablo and Rogue), or 
cut to combat on a separate “battlefield” screen. The top-down 
view seems to be used more often, and I personally prefer it, but 
the differences between both are largely cosmetic in RPG Maker 
MV. That said, as some of the characters I plan to use lack default 
side-view sprites, I will be using the top-down view of combat in 
this book.
• 
How will the loot system work? Many dungeon crawlers eschew 
the usual static treasure chests in favor of a more randomized 
system. This can result in some crazy things, such as getting the 
third-best sword in the game on the second floor. Such craziness 
has been largely circumvented over the years by the presence of 
loot tables that determine what can and cannot drop in a certain 
area. Another important consideration in the same train of 
thought is whether you will have the player find most of his/her 
items in the dungeon or have a town’s shop stock some of them. 
In the latter case, gold (or whatever you would call your currency) 
gains value.

• 
How will the leveling system work? Most dungeon crawlers 
stay true to their RPG core. Thus, enemies offer experience, and 
the player’s character (or characters) levels up once he/she has 
earned sufficient experience. On that note…
• 
Will my dungeon crawler be a party-based or individual 
character game? This is a really important question with no 
single correct answer. Citing as examples the games mentioned 
at the beginning of this chapter, Rogue and Diablo are controlled 
by a single character. Etrian Odyssey and Eye of the Beholder, on 
the other hand, are party affairs. As RPG Maker MV (RMMV) 
is designed to handle a battle party of up to four members, the 
easiest type of dungeon crawler to create with the engine is a 
party-based one.
• 
Will my dungeon crawler have permadeath? This is another 
important question, to which you should probably answer “no,” 
unless you have a very specific reason to implement it in your 
game. Permadeath is short for “permanent death” and basically 
means that if characters die, they stay dead, with no way to be 
revived or otherwise allow you to use them in your party any 
longer. Most roguelikes include permadeath, which adds to their 
notorious levels of difficulty. They also have a single save game 
slot that deletes itself when the player dies, to prevent him/her 
from cheating death, as it were. Our game, on the other hand, will 
not have any of these mechanics.
• 
Will the player be able to return to the town after leaving? This 
correlates with earlier points of interest. If you want the player to 
live solely off of his/her own resources, you can bar access to the 
town after he/she leaves the first time. On the other hand, you 
wouldn’t want to do this if you want the character to be able to 
use the town to sell his/her hard-earned loot and buy niceties.
Exactly how I implement game play will be explained throughout the book.
■
■Note   It’s as good a time as any to point out that our game will not have a world map. 
The player starts in a town and goes into a linear dungeon that descends ever deeper into 
the bowels of the town.
The Town of Eagle’s Crossing
As the sole representation of civilization present in our game, Eagle’s Crossing will be our 
player’s destination for rest, when he/she is not diving into the dungeon. The player will 
have access only to a specific part of Eagle’s Crossing called the Adventurer’s Quarter. It 
houses four buildings that provide for most of an aspiring dungeon crawler’s needs. See 
Figure 1-1.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework

The four buildings of Eagle’s Crossing are (starting from the top left and going in a 
clockwise motion) are as follows:
• 
The Equipment Shop: Sells weapons and armor for use by the 
Warrior and the Bandit. The Mage is better served by shopping at 
the Magic Shop.
• 
The Pub: Every adventurer needs a place to kick back and relax 
when after returning from a particularly draining dungeon crawl. 
The pub serves as both a place to recruit companions and recover 
HP (health points) and MP (magic points).
• 
The Magic Shop: Sells equipment and spells for the Mage. The 
Bandit may also derive some benefit from visiting this shop, while 
the Warrior will probably give it a pass.
• 
The Item Shop: Sells consumable items and other miscellanea. 
All characters will want to visit this shop, if only to buy potions to 
restore HP and MP.

Perceptive eyes will also note the presence of a nonplayer character (NPC) at the 
lower-right corner of the town, seemingly blocked off from the rest of civilization. He’ll be 
host to a particularly neat shop concept, but I’ll get to that in the final chapter. The first 
order of business is to make the map, as displayed in Figure 1-1. Here’s what you need to do:
• 
Create a new project, if you haven’t already, by clicking the File 
menu near the top of the application and then clicking New 
Project (you can press Ctrl+N, if you’d rather use hotkeys instead). 
You can name the project whatever you like (I named mine Make 
a 2D RPG in a Weekend, just like this book).
• 
Erase the default MAP001 included in every RPG Maker MV 
project by right-clicking on it and then selecting Delete from the 
list that appears (or pressing Del after left-clicking on the specific 
map). Choose Yes when the confirmation box appears.
• 
Create a new map by right-clicking (or pressing Enter/Return after 
having clicked on) the project name at the lower-left corner of the 
screen (that part of RMMV is the map list and is where our game’s 
maps will go). Make sure that the new map has a width of 25 
and a height of 25 and uses the Outside Tileset. Name it “Eagle’s 
Crossing.” Set its BGM to Town2.
• 
Verify that RMMV is in Map Editing Mode (you can find the 
option in the Mode menu; alternatively, press F5).
• 
Directly below the menu bar, there are several series of icons. 
You’ll want to find the series that has a pencil next to a square. 
Those are two out of five of RMMV’s map-drawing tools.
• 
Using either the pencil or the square tool (I prefer the pencil for 
single tiles and the square tool for larger groups of tiles, such as 
the roofs of our town’s buildings), copy the map in Figure 1-1 
(if the black and white is throwing you off, you can find blank 
versions of all of the maps in this game in the downloadable 
source code). Both tools are used by left-clicking after selecting 
the tile you wish to draw on the map. (With the square tool, you 
can also hold the mouse button and drag, to increase the size of 
your rectangle.)
■
■Tip   You can right-click on a pre-existing tile on a map to set it as the active tile to be 
painted. This is useful for fixing mapping mistakes on the fly. 
• 
Once you are done with the exterior, you’ll want to create the 
building interiors. With that said, take a look at the following note.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework
7
■
■Note  Using the sample maps provided within RMMV is a great way to populate your 
game world. You can find them by right-clicking the map list at the lower-left corner of 
RMMV and selecting the Load option. Load has no hotkey shortcut.
I’ll show off the Load option for the Equipment Shop and then manually create the 
other two maps. I do this because there are no convenient Pub and Magic Shop maps in 
the Sample Map list for MV. For the amount of tweaking you have to do, it’s roughly as  
fast to just start from scratch. For a longer game, you’ll probably want to dedicate a single 
map to the entirety of your town’s interiors. Because this game will be designed in fewer 
than 20 maps (most of those will be consigned to the dungeon floors themselves), we can 
use one map slot per building. It doesn’t matter much, all things being told. In any case, 
I tweaked the interior maps so that they would fit in a 17×13 tile space (this stops the map 
from scrolling while the player is on it). It gives the shops and the pub a neat little sense 
of coziness, in my opinion, anyway. Figures 1-2 to 1-4 contain the relevant screenshots. 
You’ll notice the absence of the Item Shop among those screenshots, but I’m planning to 
do something neat with that near the end of the chapter. For the sake of consistency, I’ll 
show the buildings in the same order as I noted them previously.
Figure 1-2.  A screenshot of the Equipment Shop

RPG Maker MV has larger tiles than RPG Maker VX Ace (48x48 in MV as opposed 
to 32x32 in Ace) and, unlike Ace, both the Weapon and Armor Shops are the same size 
(21x13). So, what I decided to do here was tweak the Weapon Shop to show off some 
armor as well, and shrink it down to 17x13 while I was at it. I added a pair of stools for the 
shopkeepers that will be later created to sell the player armor and weapons respectively.
You might have noticed the lack of the flame in Figure 1-2 which is present in the 
unaltered Weapon Shop map. You may have even attempted to erase it to no avail. As it 
turns out, that flame is an event and not a map tile. Events are the backbone of RMMV 
game creation, so they will be used in great detail throughout this book. However, if you 
want to get rid of the flame now, follow these steps.
Change RMMV to Event Editing Mode (hotkey: F6) by left-clicking on the Mode 
option at the top part of the RMMV editor and then clicking on Event.
Then, right-click on the flame event and then select Delete from the list that pops up. 
Alternatively, you can left-click on the event and press the Del key.
■
■Note   Don’t forget to rename the Weapon Shop map to Equipment Shop!
As mentioned already, there is no Pub sample map in RPG Maker MV (or Ace, to be 
fair). In the Ace version of this book, I tweaked the InnF1F sample map. However, for this 
version, I decided to use my previously created map as the template. So, use Figure 1-3 as 
your visual aid to create the Pub.
Figure 1-3.  A screenshot of the Pub
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework

■
■Note   When you create the new map for the Pub, make sure that you are using 
the Inside tileset and not the Outside tileset. Otherwise, you won’t be able to place the 
necessary tiles.
It’s sparsely decorated as compared to most MV sample maps, but it gets the job 
done. In any case, this building will also have two NPCs. One will offer companions for 
hire, while the other will act as the town’s innkeeper, allowing the player to rest between 
dungeon crawls.
Like the Pub, there is no RMMV sample map for a Magic Shop. Unlike the Pub, such 
a sample map used to exist in RMVXA. As such, the map in Figure 1-4 is based off of Ace’s 
magic shop (with a few differences based on textures that exist in one program but not the 
other). A single NPC will be sitting on the stool closest to the entrance and will offer both 
spell scrolls and equipment best suited to the Mage.
Figure 1-4.  A screenshot of the Magic Shop
■
■Tip  The easiest way to copy large swaths of terrain is by holding down the right button 
on your mouse and dragging it to encompass the area you require. The resulting rectangle 
of tiles can be placed by left-clicking the map. I recommend using the Pencil Tool for this.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework

While our town is currently devoid of life, that will be changing soon. We’re going to 
add some NPCs to our world. You’ll have to do the following:
• 
Switch from Map Editing Mode to Event Editing Mode. You can 
either use the Mode menu or press F6 (the hotkey for Event 
Editing Mode).
• 
Once you’re in Event Editing Mode, you can right-click any tile 
of the map to bring up a small menu with several options. Head 
on over to the Magic Shop and right-click the stool behind the 
counter. The option we want to click is New Event.
• 
Afterward, you will be greeted by a large screen with many 
options. For now, just double-click Graphic and select the NPC 
graphic that most appeals to you for a Magic shopkeeper. (Most of 
the human characters are contained in the graphics sets that are 
named Actor and People.)
• 
Repeat this process on the other maps to add four other NPCs in 
the following locations: two in the pub (behind the counter), and 
two for the equipment shop (again, behind the counter).
That’s all well and good, but now we have to link each of the building interiors 
with its exterior. To do this, we must use transfer events. You can create a transfer event 
automatically (via the Quick Event Creation submenu that you receive when you right-
click a map in Event Editing Mode) or manually. Also, there’s a way to make a single 
transfer event that covers multiple locations. As you may have noticed when you created 
your first event, the Create Event screen defaults to a certain set of parameters. Walking is 
toggled; the event Priority is set to Below characters (meaning players can pass over the 
event square); and the event Trigger is set to Action Button, meaning that the player can 
activate the event by pressing Enter while in contact with the event. For Below characters 
and Above characters, the player is in contact when he/she is directly above/below the 
event. For Same as characters, the player is in contact with the event when he/she is 
directly next to and facing it.
With all of that said, when I list event code during the course of this book, I will list 
any differences in starting parameters and then write out the actual contents of the events 
themselves. To add an event command to an event, all you have to do is right-click the 
¨ symbol in the Contents section and select Insert. You will receive a three-page list of 
event commands that you can plug into any of your events. For example, following is a 
transfer event that connects the interior of the Equipment Shop to its exterior. Note how 
the event’s contents are displayed with the ¨ symbol at the beginning. This is exactly how 
it would look inside RMMV.
Trigger: Player Touch
¨ Play SE: Move1, (90, 100, 0)
¨ Transfer Player:Eagle's Crossing (6,11)
¨
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework
11
■
■Note  I used Quick Event Creation to make the event above. Note how automatic 
transfer events default to Player Touch instead of Action Button. As the name implies, such 
an event triggers when the player walks onto it (or into it, in the case of Same as Characters 
Priority).
Using that transfer event as a template, make the other two interior transfer events. 
Once you’re done, you’ll want to make the events for the exterior. But first, let me show 
off a neat new feature of RPG Maker MV! Say you wanted to make sure that your transfer 
events were working properly. There’s a new option in the Event Editor called Test that 
allows you to see if a certain event command will work as you want it to. Right-click on the 
Equipment Shop transfer event, open it, and follow these steps to test it.
Left-click on the first event command (Play SE).
Then, hold Shift, and left-click on the second event command (Transfer Player).
If done correctly, both events should now be selected. Lastly, right-click on any of the 
selected events and click on Test (alternately, press Ctrl+R).
You should see a completely black screen come up (with the sole exception of a 
single character in the middle), hear a sound effect, and then have the screen fade out 
as the character is transferred to their destination. If that is what happened on your 
computer, then the test has been successful!
■
■Note  Generally speaking, Test will only be useful for events that don’t require external 
values. For instance, Test won’t do anything for the Parallel event coming up, as that 
requires values that are only set when the player is moving on the map.
Anyway, let’s get back to working on our transfer events. I believe we were about to 
make the exterior transfer event.
This time, let’s use one of my favorite transfer event trimming devices: the Parallel 
trigger. Events with a Parallel trigger are always running in the background, waiting to be 
activated. Be careful not to crash/hang your game with them! Anyway, click one of the 
corner squares of Eagle’s Crossing and create a new event. This meta transfer event, if you 
will, is going to do the following:
• 
Determine the player’s location by polling his/her x,y position 
and storing the data into a pair of variables. The Control Variables 
event command will handle this.
• 
Via the use of Conditional Branches (another event command), 
check to see if the player is standing at the entrance to one of the 
buildings.
• 
If he/she is, transfer him/her to the appropriate interior map.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ■ Laying Out the Framework
12
Without further ado, here’s the event:
Trigger: Parallel
¨Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
¨Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
¨If: X = 6
  ¨If: Y = 10
    ¨Transfer Player:Equipment Shop (8,11)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨
: End
¨If: X = 18
  ¨If: Y = 10
    ¨Transfer Player:Pub (8,11)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨
: End
¨If: X = 18
  ¨If: Y = 19
    ¨Transfer Player:Magic Shop (8,11)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨
: End
¨
■
■Tip  Another way to go about this is through the use of regions. You would have to use 
Get Location Info in conjunction with a third variable, to store the region value of the square 
the player is standing on. Then, you use a distinct region for each building entrance. I will be 
using regions in a later chapter.
If we were to use a region for the same effect, part of the Parallel event would look 
something like the following code (keep in mind that you need to actually mark the 
Equipment Shop entrance with the correct region, or nothing will happen):
¨Control Variables: #0019 X] = Map X of Player
¨Control Variables: #0020 Y] = Map Y of Player
¨Get Location Info: Region, Region ID, ({X},{Y})
¨If: Region = 1
  ¨Transfer Player:Weapon Shop (8,11)
  ¨
: End
¨

13
As long as you’re not planning to use the regions for something else (and, given 
that you have 255 possible regions, this should not be an issue), it could be a nice way 
to handle area transitions. Now, what happens if you want to embrace even more 
minimalism in your game and don’t want your buildings to have actual interiors?
The Adventurer’s Quarter in Eagle’s Crossing— 
A Minimalist Item Shop
That’s a bit of a mouthful for a section title, isn’t it? Anyway, this section will tackle the 
opposite approach. We’re going to create an Item Shop that consists merely of a single 
event that handles what would normally be handled by NPCs inside the building. On that 
same note, the Item Shop won’t have an interior. We want this event to do the following:
• 
Make the player’s sprite disappear (to simulate the effect of going 
into the building).
• 
Bring up a description of the shop and its keeper(s). For 
subsequent visits, you could make it so that said description is 
abbreviated a bit.
• 
Give the player a list of choices. In the Item Shop, the choices 
would be Shop and Leave.
• 
Once the player is done, have him/her leave the shop and make 
his/her sprite reappear.
• 
Otherwise, revert to the previous list of choices, so that the 
character can continue shopping.
If you want to try your hand at the event, here is what it will require in terms of raw 
event commands and setup.
• 
Change Transparency
• 
Show Text
• 
Show Choices
• 
Shop Processing
• 
Set Move Route
• 
Jump to Label/Label
• 
The event should have a Below Characters priority and a Player 
Touch trigger.
That shouldn’t be too hard to work out. If you figured it out and want to check against 
what I did, or are otherwise stumped, take a look at the following to see the relevant event 
code. Do note that we have yet to design what kinds of items our game will have. As that 
will be covered later on, I’m using comment placeholders for the event. You’ll want to 
place this event directly on top of the entrance to the Item Shop.

¨
There you have it! The label is used to ensure that the player is not kicked out of 
the building as soon as he/she leaves a shop. By doing it this way, we make it so that the 
player has to consciously leave the shop. You could do the same thing for each of the 
other buildings as well, if you’re so inclined.
Of Blank Maps
As mentioned at the start of the chapter, the source code for this book includes the 
entire game. If you’re ever stumped by how I implemented X or Y, feel free to take a look. 
Additionally, if you’d rather not draw up the area maps yourself, I provide blank versions of 
every single map used for the game in the same project file. Drawing maps for your game is 
good practice but one of the most time-consuming aspects of working with RMMV. Because 
the intent of this book is to create and complete a game within a weekend, don’t hesitate to 
use the blanks to accelerate your progress, if need be. That concludes this chapter.
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we started work on our game, establishing the basic plot 
of the story, the playable characters, and creation of the basic skeleton of Eagle’s Crossing. 
We will finish populating the town in Chapter 4. In the next chapter, we will create our 
game’s main characters and a way for the player to select which to play the game as.

Chapter 2
The Characters of Our Game
This chapter is all about our three characters and the many systems related to them. 
During the course of this chapter, I will cover subjects such as the stat system that we will 
use for our game, a list of weapons and armor that will be available, and a way for the 
player to pick which character he/she would like to use.
Overview
The first order of business is to decide how we want our stat system to work in our 
dungeon crawler. By default, RPG Maker MV (RMMV) favors high numbers. For example, 
a character can have up to 9999 HP (health points) and MP (magic points). However, 
most of the dungeon crawlers I mentioned in the previous chapter run with much lower 
numbers. For instance, Diablo’s characters have one primary stat that can be increased 
to 255 and three secondary stats with lower caps. So, in the interest of differentiating our 
game a little more from RMMV’s default system, let’s lower our stats by a lot. Doing this 
will also help us simplify the game in ways that possibly won’t be apparent for quite a 
while. First, head to the Database and erase the preexisting entries for everything in the 
Classes and Actors tabs of the Database. You can find the Database from the Tools menu 
at the top of the application or by pressing F9.
■
■Tip  A really easy way to purge a Database section is by changing the section’s 
maximum entries to 1. You can do this by clicking Change Maximum near the bottom of 
most Database tabs. Then, you need only reset the value to the maximum of your choice, 
right-click the lone remaining entry, and then click Clear (or press Del) to delete it.
After you are done with the purge, head over to the Classes tab. Let’s create the 
classes for our three playable characters. First, we need to figure out each class’s starting 
stats, as well as how much of each stat we want them to gain at each level. As I mentioned, 
www.it-ebooks.info

I want the stat system to have low numbers. Right now, all of the stat curves are high. 
Take a look at Table 2-1 to see how low I’m going. MHP and MMP are abbreviations of 
Maximum HP and Maximum MP respectively. The other abbreviations are as follows:
• 
ATK – Attack
• 
DEF – Defense
• 
MAT – Magic Attack
• 
MDF – Magic Defense
• 
AGI – Agility
• 
LUK - Luck

As you can see, the Warrior starts with the most HP but no MP, while the Mage starts 
with the least HP and the most MP. The Bandit’s stats are between those of the other two 
classes. Note how each class differs in its stat gains and its initial stats. Taking the Warrior 
class as an example, here’s how you can set up/change its stats:
• 
Double-click any of the eight parameter curves, and a new 
window will open, containing the base curve. Keeping in mind 
that RMMV can plot a custom stat curve, all you need to know is 
the character’s stat value at 1 and 99, based on stat growth.
• 
Click Generate Curve, and you’ll get a window much like Figure 2-1  
(which illustrates the Mage’s HP curve). In the Warrior’s case, he 
has 50 HP at Level 1. For Level 99, he will have leveled up 98 times 
for 6 extra HP a level, or 588 more HP. So, the Warrior will have 
638 HP at a hypothetical Level 99.

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
17
■
■Note  The slider bar below the curve values determines the speed at which the class 
gains that particular stat. You can make classes that gain the bulk of a stat early in their 
career and others that gain it later on. For the purposes of this game, leave all of these 
sliders on the default setting of Average. 
• 
Plug in 50 for Level 1 and 638 for Level 99, and you’re set! Now, 
I could have you crunch all of those other max parameters, but 
that would be mean. So, instead, see Table 2-2 for a list of the 
maximum stats for each of the three classes at Level 99.

With those numbers in hand, take some time and fill out the stat blocks for each of 
the three classes. After that, we have one last curve to work on: the experience curve. By 
clicking the button marked “...” below Exp Curve, you’ll bring up a screen with various 
parameters that can be changed with scrolling bars. Minimize all of them (which drops 
Base Value, Acceleration A and Acceleration B to 10 and Extra Value to 0) for the three 
classes and then note how the experience required per level has dropped.
■
■Note  A quirk of dropping all four parameters to their minimums is that experience 
requirements to gain a level beyond level 84 drop rather than increase. This isn’t significant, 
given our game’s level cap; it’s just a neat little bit of trivia that I noticed.
The last thing we have to do in the Classes tab is set up the features of each class. 
However, let’s first take a small break and go to the Types tab of the Database. Once 
there, you’ll see listings for five types of items used within RMMV: Elements, Skill Types, 
Weapon Types, Armor Types, and Equipment Types. First, purge every box save for 
Equipment Types of their contents. Next, fill them out, per Figure 2-2. (You can edit a 
term by left-clicking a field and then writing in or editing the appropriate name in the box 
directly above Change Maximum.)

This will be necessary so that setting up the weapon features of each class (and 
creating equipment) later on makes sense. You can see in the terms shown in the figure 
some design decisions I hadn’t mentioned yet. I split Physical into three distinct types 
of damage. This allows us to make enemies that are resistant to a type of physical attack, 
while being vulnerable to another type. As for magical elements, I dropped them down 
to merely three, for the sake of simplicity. As you will see in Tables 2-3 and 2-4 this game 
will have seven Weapon Types. As for Armor Types, you might be surprised to see arrows 
make up a category there, but that is the easiest way to have an off-hand item in RMMV. 
With the updated terms in place, we can now add all relevant features to our character 
classes. See Table 2-3 for a list of features that each class should have.

■Tip  You can add and edit class Features by right-clicking a preexistent feature or, in the 
empty slot directly below the last feature in the list (the very first slot, if the Feature list is 
completely empty), by selecting Edit. Double-clicking works as well.
You may be wondering why Target Rate is absent from the table above, as RMMV 
adds it as a default class feature. Target Rate influences the rate at which enemies attack 
a certain character (they favor characters with higher Target Rate.) Since this isn’t such 
a big deal in a game that will only ever have at most two characters in the same party 
(future chapter spoiler alert!), we can just leave it at its default. Now, flip over to the Actors 
tab and create your three characters. First, add their sprites and portraits, as seen in 
Figure 2-3.
■
■Note  As mentioned in Chapter 1, we are going to use the top-down view for battles. 
Thus, we don’t need to set side view graphics, hence their absence in Figure 2-3.

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game

■
■Note   You can find Palnor’s sprite in the People3 sprite set and his portrait in the 
similarly named portrait set. Gust’s graphics are located under Evil, while Feylia’s are in 
Actor2.
Next, we will fill out the General Settings for each actor as follows:
• 
Palnor: Class: Warrior—Initial Level: 1—Max Level: 20—Profile: 
He seeks the ancient artifact in order to revive his kin and the rest 
of the people of his town.
• 
Gust: Class: Bandit—Initial Level: 1—Max Level: 20—Profile: He 
seeks the ancient artifact in order to revive the love of his life.
• 
Feylia: Class: Mage—Initial Level: 1—Max Level: 20—Profile: She 
seeks the ancient artifact to revive her brother, lost to a plague 
years before.
In filling out the General Settings, you may have noticed the Initial Equipment 
section of the Actors tab. I’ll get to that in a bit.
Equipping the Characters
For now, we’ll want to come up with the armor and weapons that the player will find 
and use during the course of a play-through. It’s not necessary to add all of the items to 
the Database just yet, but your game will benefit greatly from thinking about this and 
adding at least the first set of equipment. For starters, this will help you balance the 
stats of any enemies that the player will face in the first few levels of the dungeon. With 
that said, Table 2-4 covers the various weapon types that the Warrior and Bandit will be 
able to use (the Mage’s staff-type weapons [staves] are a bit different, and I’ll cover them 
momentarily).

Feylia’s sprite and portrait

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game

The table bears a little explanation. Mainly, our game will have six types of materials 
for weapons. Those materials are (in order of damage potential): wood, copper, bronze, 
iron, steel, and mythril. The base potential damage of a weapon is the amount of ATK 
(Attack) given by a wooden version of that weapon. For each tier higher than Wood, 
you add the improvement value. So, a mythril sword would give the wielder 12 ATK. 2H 
is shorthand for “two-handed.”  (It’s a common nomenclature in role-playing gaming 
communities, so you might have already known that.) Only Palnor the Warrior is allowed 
to use two-handed swords and axes, which have roughly 50% more ATK than their 
one-handed cousins. Only Gust the Bandit is allowed to use bows, and they inflict extra 
damage if you have an arrow equipped in the off-hand slot (the one used for shields by 
default in RMMV). Feylia’s staves are a bit different in that they increase her ATK like 
other weapons, but they also increase her Magic Attack (MAT). Additionally, there are 
only four types of distinct staff-type weapons. Obsidian is in the same tier as iron is for 
other weapons, while crystal is the same as for mythril. See Table 2-5.

Armor is a little more complex than weapons. For one, mythril, in our game (and in 
certain fantasy settings throughout the years), is a magical metal that’s unusually light. 
Thus, it is possible to make from it a tunic that even Feylia can wear. In the same vein, 
Palnor can wear any type of armor. Gust can wear light and medium armor, while Feylia 
can only wear light armor. The first five tiers of heavy armor are full plates (that is to say, 
they’re a full suit of armor). Thus, Palnor cannot wear a helm while wearing any of those 
suits. Adamantine, in our game, is an exceedingly heavy metal that offers unparalleled 
protection, should you have the strength to wear it. No one was/is crazy enough to try and 
make weapons out of that particular metal. Adamantine comes in both chestplate (which 
allows a helm to be worn) and full plate varieties. See Table 2-6 for a full list of DEF values 
for our game’s armor.
Table 2-6.  List of Armor and Helms Available in the Game
■
■Tip  To prevent players from equipping both a fullplate and any helm, you can add the 
Seal Equip trait to the relevant heavy armors and then set the equipment slot to be sealed 
to Head. You can add traits to weapons and armors exactly like you added features to the 
game’s character classes. Matter of fact, traits used to also be called features back in RPG 
Maker VX Ace.

Some More Equipment-Related Talk
Before you actually sit down to add the weapons and armor to the Database, there are 
some other considerations concerning them.
Pricing
How much gold will each piece of equipment cost? The easiest way to determine this is 
to price each similar item identically (give all one-handed weapons of the same tier the 
same price and do the same for two-handers as well). Of course, that would imply that 
all of the items are the same. In our game, axes do more damage than swords, which 
do more damage than daggers. One way to keep things fair is to have weapons modify 
the wielder’s Hit Rate when used. Hit Rate determines with what frequency an attack 
connects with its target. Each of our three characters has a natural Hit Rate declared in 
their Features list. Weapons and armor in RMMV can also contain features. When you 
give a piece of equipment the Hit Rate Feature, it modifies the user’s Hit Rate by the 
declared amount. One-handed swords would be the middle ground, with no Hit Rate 
change. Axes would give the player a penalty to Hit Rate, while daggers grant a bonus. 
Two-handed weapons would give the wielder a Hit Rate penalty (stacking, in the case of 
axes). Feylia’s physical attacks are already the weakest of those of the three classes, so let’s 
make staves a neutral Hit Rate weapon.
Take a look at Table 2-7; it summarizes the Hit Rate penalties and bonuses that I am 
talking about.
Table 2-7.  Weapon Type and Its HIT% Adjustment When Used
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
24
In addition, bows come slightly cheaper than one-handed swords and axes, because 
they require the added expense of arrows, to be fully effective. Arrows (not displayed in 
the preceding table) cost two-thirds the price of a bow of the equivalent tier. So, a wooden 
arrow would cost 10, a copper arrow 30, and so forth. As for armor (displayed in Table 2-9),  
pricing is a little more fluid. The reason for this is that it is subdivided into body armor 
and helmets. Thus, we have to control the pricing a little, lest it spiral out of control. Also, 
we have to price heavy armor accordingly, given that it consists (with the sole exception 
of the Adamantine Chestplate) of full suits that disallow the use of a separate helmet. Last, 
helmets (Table 2-10) cost half the gold of the body armor they complement. An iron helm 
costs 540 gold, for example.
Table 2-8.  Cost of Each Type of Weapon, Depending on the Material It Is Made Of
Table 2-9.  The Cost of Armor in the Game
Now, for the pricing system. Weapons have a base price, which is how much a 
wooden type of that weapon costs. Weapons in every tier above that one are three times 
more expensive. Once again, staves are a bit different. See Table 2-8 for the breakdown.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
25
With all of that set up, you are ready to add each of the weapons and armor to the 
Database, but not before I show you how.
Creating Your First Weapon and Armor
As I tend to note when asked, “RPG Maker is nothing if not intuitive.” RMMV is not the 
exception to the rule. Thus, adding and deleting things from the Database is as easy 
as can be. Take a moment to purge the Weapon and Armor tabs of the Database. Once 
you’re done, change the maximum of the Weapons tab to 40 and the Armor tab to 43. I’m 
going to guide you through creating a wooden sword and a cloth tunic.
First the Sword...
Head over to the Weapons tab and click the first Weapon slot on the left-hand portion 
of the screen. If you have erased everything beforehand, you should see a whole lot of 
nothing. Let’s start by filling out the General Settings section:
• 
Name: Wooden Sword
• 
Item (by “Item,” I mean items, weapons, and armor) icons draw 
from a special set of graphics. Double-clicking the Icon square 
will reveal the set. If you click any of the graphics, you will see 
the index value (Icon) change (you can see the index value at the 
lower-left corner of the window containing the graphics). The 
Sword icon is at index value 97.
• 
Description: A one-handed sword made of wood.
• 
Weapon Type: Sword
• 
Price: 20
• 
Animation: Slash Physical
Table 2-10.  The Cost of Helmets in the Game
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
26
Next, let’s move on to the Parameter Changes section, where you need only give the 
wooden sword an Attack of 2. No other parameters are changed. As for Traits, make the 
wooden sword’s Attack Element Slash.
...Then the Tunic
Switch to the Armor tab and click the first Armor slot on the left-hand portion of the 
screen. As before, let’s start by filling out General Settings:
• 
Name: Cloth Tunic
• 
Icon: Index value 135
• 
Description: A tunic made of cloth.
• 
Armor Type: Light Armor
• 
Price: 10
• 
Equipment Type: Body
As for Parameter Changes, the cloth tunic will grant 2 Defense, and nothing else. The 
tunic is also functionally featureless. (It has a 0% Evasion Rate by default, which I left in 
for the sake of having something there, because why not?)
See, that wasn’t so bad! Now, you can work on adding the other weapons and 
armor yourself. Feel free to choose the icons that you most like (although there are very 
few options in default item icons in MV, unlike Ace), as that’s hardly important for the 
purposes of this book. Before I close out this section, you’ll want to see Table 2-11 for a list 
of the Attack Elements of each of the different weapon types.
■
■Note  Attack Element is another Trait and, as such, can be added to both weapons and 
armor. In our game’s case, I’ll only be adding it to weapons. Simplicity is best.
Table 2-11.  A List of the Attack Elements of Each Weapon Type in Our Game
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
27
When adding the items to the Database, you’ll quickly notice that there will be 
space left over in the Armor tab, but that’s intentional, as we’ll be adding a few things to it 
during the course of this book.
■
■Note  Don’t hesitate to take a look at the source code for help, if you want to see some 
more of the items in a completed state.
So, remember back when we added Arrows as an Armor term? Check the next 
section for a display of how we’re going to make arrows equippable with a bow (and only 
with a bow).
Equipping a Bow and Arrow
The bow is easy. We just treat the bow like any other weapon, and we’re set. How about 
the arrow? You might be thinking: I could just set the bow to allow Dual Wielding. If you 
do that, then the player could equip Gust with two bows. As amusing as that mental 
image is, let’s not do that. How about giving only Gust the ability to equip arrows? It’s a 
valid idea. After all, he is the only one of the three characters that can use bows in the first 
place. However, if you do that, the player can equip a dagger (or sword or axe, for that 
matter) in the main hand and an arrow in the off-hand. Quite the quandary, isn’t it? Take 
a look at Figure 2-4 to see how we solve it.
Figure 2-4.  A screenshot of the Wooden Bow and the property that allows its wielder to 
equip Arrows
Mainly, we make it so that bows allow their wielder to equip arrows as well (it’s one 
of the weapon Traits; you can see it on the right-hand side of Figure 2-4). Had we made 
arrows a weapon type rather than an armor type, we would have to enable Dual Wielding, 
which allows the loophole I warned against previously. Done in this way, we don’t have to 
give Gust the ability to equip arrows (he’ll gain the ability to use them for as long as he has 
a bow equipped), which closes the other loophole.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
28
Now you should have your weapons and armor set, and your bows should have the 
correct Trait interaction with arrows. With that arduous task completed, we can now give 
our three characters some starting equipment. Head back to the Actors tab and allocate 
the starting equipment like so: Palnor should start with a copper sword and a cloth tunic, 
Gust should start with a copper dagger and a cloth tunic, and Feylia should start with a 
wooden staff and a cloth tunic.
Creating a Character Select System
Every good RPG that allows a choice of characters begins with a character select screen. 
It would be a bit jarring if you were to pick your character after the game had already 
started, after all. During the course of this section, we’ll be creating a way for the player to 
choose which of the three characters he/she wishes to play as. Broadly speaking, there are 
two ways to allow the player to select a character.
• 
Use eventing on a special map.
• 
Use scripting to create a special Scene that holds a character 
creation menu.
As this is a weekend project, we’ll be doing the former, which will take minutes, 
as opposed to the latter, which can take hours, unless you already have some amount 
of programming savvy and know-how. To complete this exercise, you will require the 
following:
• 
A new character that exists only while the player is choosing a 
character to play.
• 
A map containing the player’s starting position and three events, 
one for each of the game’s distinct characters.
• 
An Autorun event on that map, giving the player instructions on 
how to select a character.
• 
Once a character has been selected, we fade out the screen, give 
some exposition, and then transfer the player to Eagle’s Crossing.
• 
At Eagle’s Crossing, we will have to add an Autorun to fade in the 
screen after the transfer and give the player a small number of 
items and some gold to start with.
Let’s go in order. Make your way to the Actors tab and select a blank slot in your 
Actors list (I chose slot 4). The only important aspect of this particular actor is its sprite 
graphic, but we’ll give it a name too, for clarity, if nothing else. See Figure 2-5 for the 
graphic used for our actor, named Spirit. (You can find it in the !Flame graphic set; it’s the 
blue flame with a full set of sprites.)

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game

Next, I created a new map at the default size of 17×13 with the Dungeon tileset. The 
name of the map itself is irrelevant, so feel free to name yours as you choose. Then, I 
added a large central platform, as well as three smaller platforms. On each platform, I 
placed an event with the graphic of one of our three player characters. I then placed a 
single event at the top-right corner of the map (where the player would be unable to reach 
it) with an Autorun trigger. The solitary event has two pages. The second page is blank, 
with an Action Button trigger, and requires that self-switch A is on.
■
■Note  Think of a switch as a variable with only two possibilities: on and off. A self-switch 
is just that, but isolated to a single event. For example, you could make it so that when the 
player opens a chest, one of that chest’s self-switches (RMMV allows four self-switches  
per event) is flipped on, preventing the chest from being opened again. The value of a  
self-switch in one event has no effect on any other event, whether on the same map or on a 
different one.
The first page contains two Show Text commands, as well as a Change Menu Access 
command (which is set to Disable; we do this so the player can’t open the menu while 
selecting a character). After those three commands are executed, we have the event set 
self-switch A to on. Take a look at Figure 2-6, to see a screenshot of what I have described.

■Caution  If you don’t break out of an event page that has the Autorun trigger, you will 
cause the game to loop it infinitely, forcing you to reset the game. In this particular case, you 
could use Erase Event to the same effect as the self-switch setting.

As you can see, each of the three distinct character selection events has various 
similarities. In all of them, we have the game replace our indistinct Spirit with the chosen 
character, once the player has decided on who he/she wishes to use. Additionally, a 
switch named after the chosen character is set to on (which can be used to great effect, 
if you want to have conversation options that differ according to the character the player 
is adopting). No matter what character is chosen, the player is transported to Eagle’s 
Crossing at the end of said event. Last, we add an Autorun event to Eagle’s Crossing that 
handles the player’s arrival at the town. This Autorun is slightly different, depending 
on the character the player has assumed. The code below remains the same, no matter 
which character is chosen.
■
■Note  While a full list of items will not be given until Chapter 4, you should take a 
moment to populate the Database with the two items listed in the following code, if only not 
to have to revisit this event later on. The Lesser Healing Potion has a Price of 10 gold and 
heals 35 HP, while the Lesser Magic Potion costs 20 gold and restores 30 MP.

first page, and then require it to be on for each of the three character specific pages. For 
example, the Palnor page would require that both the Palnor switch and Self Switch A be on. 
Then, in each character specific page, you would set Self Switch B (instead of A as shown 
above) to on. The last page would have a non-Autorun trigger and require that Self Switch 
B be turned on. In the latter case, as you would only have two pages, the final non-Autorun 
page would require that Self Switch A be turned on.

Chapter 2 ■ The Characters of Our Game
35
Before I conclude this chapter, you’ll want to do the following:
• 
Enter the Database and go to the System tab. Once there, change 
the Starting Party so that it only contains the Spirit actor.
• 
In that same tab, find the Options section and uncheck Show 
Player Followers and Display TP in Battle.
• 
Set the player’s starting position to the character selection map 
(as displayed in Figure 2-6)
• 
Last, but definitely not least, you’ll want to playtest the game 
to make sure that everything is in working order. If you have 
implemented the events and such correctly, you should be able 
to choose your character, control them once they are in Eagle’s 
Crossing, and open the menu to save and use items, among other 
things.
With all of that said and done, we have finished this chapter!
Summary
During the course of this chapter, I covered many concepts concerning our game’s three 
playable characters. These include their base stats and stat growths, their equipment 
permissions, and a special map that serves as our game’s character-selection screen. In 
the next chapter, we will start work on our game’s dungeon.

Chapter 3
The Upper Catacombs of 
Eagle’s Crossing
Whereas the previous chapter covered our characters and created a basic selection 
system from which the player could choose, this chapter will cover the start of the 
dungeon crawl. In this chapter, we’re going to design our game’s first level.
Overview
The dungeon is the meat of a dungeon crawler game. The town exists only as a way 
station where the player can restore his/her resources in between trips. So, it’s about time 
that we actually start work on the dungeon, right? First of all, we have to decide how many 
levels we want the game’s dungeon to have. Six is a nice number to start with, so we’ll go 
with that. Next, we must figure out what zones, if any, the dungeon will be divided into. 
For example, Etrian Odyssey is divided into five distinct zones (called stratums) of five 
floors each (as well as a sixth postgame stratum containing an extra five floors). Our game 
will have four different zones.
• 
The Catacombs: They will make up the first two levels of the 
dungeon. The Upper Catacombs will be Level 1 and the Lower 
Catacombs Level 2.
• 
The Caves: They will compose the next level of the dungeon.
• 
The Pixies’ Forest: This part of the dungeon will make up Levels 
4 and 5 of our game.
• 
The Ancient Temple: This is the last level of the game, in which 
the player will find the hidden artifact.
This chapter will cover the first level of the catacombs. So let us begin.

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing

The Upper Catacombs
The catacombs were created centuries ago to serve as a resting place for 
the dead of a higher…calling. Kings, nobles, and other people of high 
rank were interred there. Living slime and smaller vermin have overrun 
the once sacred grounds. It is there that your adventure begins.
That’s a little flavor blurb for the first dungeon level of our game. The first order of 
business is to map out our first level and populate it with treasure, enemies, and even 
a simple puzzle. Create a new map that is 40×32 in size, with the Dungeon1 BGM and a 
Cobblestones4 & Stone3 Battleback. You can do this by right-clicking (or pressing Return 
after left-clicking) the project name (or a preexisting map) in the map list section of RPG 
Maker MV (RMMV; lower-left corner). Then, see Figure 3-1 for a screenshot of the Upper 
Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing.

■
■Note  An easy way to set apart dungeon levels of a particular zone is to give them a 
distinct graphical style. The style I’ll use for the catacombs (with a certain exception on 
the second floor) uses the Wall Q (Temple) tile for walls and the gray Cobblestones tile for 
the floor.
While I have provided a screenshot of the finalized map, it would still be good to talk 
about the map design process. Much like most other aspects of game design, practice will 
make perfect. Here is how I tackle my maps in RMMV.
• 
Step One: Brainstorm ideas for possible map elements. This 
part of the map-creating process is purely conceptual. In the case 
of our first level, I wanted to have a simple floor that introduces 
the new player to the concept of the dungeon crawler. The Upper 
Catacombs contain several roaming encounters with Slimes and 
Rats, the two weakest enemies of our game. It also has a chest 
containing a key that will open the door blocking access to the 
second floor, as well as a secret passage for the perceptive.
• 
Step Two: Draw up the basic terrain map—in RMMV, I mean. 
You can use the drawing tools near the top of the editor (the series 
of five icons that starts with a pencil and ends with a gray circle) 
by entering Map Editing Mode (pressing F5 or selecting it from the 
Mode submenu in the menu toolbar), selecting your tile of choice, 
and left-clicking while using your chosen drawing tool. In other 
words, this step is the map equivalent of creating an outline when 
writing a book. You should draw the major defining features of your 
map (using the tiles contained within the A tab) at this time.
• 
Step Three: Add doodads. Doodads are the little things that add 
variety to what would otherwise be a stale map. You can find 
doodads in tabs B and C of any given tileset. This map has coffins 
and statues that may or may not serve a greater purpose later on.
• 
Step Four: Add events. After the terrain has been mapped 
out with the Map Tool, we use the Event Tool to cover the rest. 
Remember that you can add events to your maps by changing to 
Event Editing Mode (pressing F6 or selecting it from the Mode 
submenu), right-clicking the square on which you wish to add the 
event, and selecting New Event (alternatively, you can left-click 
the square and press Enter/Return). In the case of this map, we 
add several roaming encounters, as well as treasure chests and 
transfer events.

■Tip  Here’s a tip related to drawing up terrain. The default visible area in an RMMV 
game is 17×13. All terrain should be drawn with that in mind. When I was a novice with 
RPG Maker, I would make maps that had way too much empty space in them. You want the 
player to have a view similar to that shown in Figure 3-2, in which the immediate area is 
populated with walls and statues.
Figure 3-2.  A screenshot of the game in progress, showing Palnor in the early parts of the 
first dungeon level
The general idea is that your player should never go through large expanses of area 
without finding a doodad or some other notable piece of terrain (exceptions to this could 
be a featureless desert or a blasted wasteland). I highly recommend that you play through 
some classic 2D role-playing games (RPGs), such as the oldest of the Final Fantasy or 
Dragon Warrior games, to see how their maps are designed. It will help you get a feel for 
your own mapmaking. If you must insert a large corridor, it should be as thin as possible, 
with turns here and there to break up the monotony. Score bonus points if you give the 
corridor significance (that is, unless you’re making a literal maze, in which case, you don’t 
want to make a bunch of corridors that lead nowhere). As already hinted at, the level 
has many twists and turns. It’s quite possible to make a dungeon that has entirely square 
rooms, but it will be fairly dull, unless you make the rooms really small (because of the 
aforementioned empty expanses).
Take some time to draw and populate the first dungeon level. Once you are done 
with that, read on. What we’re going to do now is add the level’s events. Broadly speaking, 
there are fewer than ten distinct events on this map. Let’s list them.
• 
We need an event for the treasure chest containing the key that 
opens the catacomb door.
• 
The door itself will be created with an event.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
41
• 
We need four events, one for each of the treasure chests in the 
secret room.
• 
We need events to represent the Slimes and others for the Rats. 
However, you only really need one of each, as you can use copy 
and paste to duplicate each as many times as necessary.
• 
We need an event to handle the stair transfer events.
• 
We need a pair of events for the secret passage leading to the  
extra chests.
The Catacomb Key
As you might imagine, our first order of business is to create the key and our first two 
enemy types. Normally, when working through a level for a game, you want to create all of 
the assets that will be used within it first. Then, you can just add the relevant events in one 
go. First, let’s create our key. Head over to the Items tab in the Database (you can access 
the Database quickly by pressing F9), expand the maximum cap to 40, and then use slot 
36 for the Catacomb Key (the reason for the strange numbering will become clear as we 
keep working on the game). See Figure 3-3 for a view of the item in question.
Figure 3-3.  A screenshot of the Catacomb Key
We don’t want the key to be sold or used up, so we set its Price to 0 and the Consumable 
property to No. Because we don’t want the player to use this particular item except when 
the game automatically does (when opening a certain door), we set Scope and Occasion 
to None and Never, respectively. You can use the Quick Treasure Chest Event to create 
the chest containing the Catacomb Key. This quick event is easily accessed by finding the 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
42
Quick Event Creation submenu in the menu opened after right-clicking a map square 
while in Event Editing Mode. Then, highlight the submenu with your mouse pointer, 
and several options will appear. Click Treasure… (or, alternatively, press Ctrl+3 after 
left-clicking the map square on which you wish to add a Quick chest) and you’re done! 
Of course, given that finding the key is an important achievement, we could reward the 
player with some experience points. 25 EXP should be plenty. You can use the Change 
Experience and Show Text event commands to tell the player that he/she has gained 
experience points. Here’s the treasure chest event for the Catacomb Key. For both of the 
event pages, tweak every option given in the following code, as needed. You can  
right-click the Contents section of the event window to add a new event command or  
edit a preexisting command.
■
■Note  The faster way to insert the treasure chest code is to create a Quick Treasure 
Chest and then edit it accordingly.

Of Damage Formulas and Spells
Before we can work on the enemies in this first level, there is something more 
immediately important to cover. We must decide what our game’s damage formulas for 
physical attacks and spells will be. Keep in mind that we lowered our game’s stats by a lot, 
so the default formula is far too much. Namely, a.atk*4 - b.def*2. To give an example 
of this formula at work, say that we have an initial monster with an ATK of 10, and the 
player character has a DEF of 5. We would be taking 30 HP of damage per hit. That would 
kill Feylia in one hit, and the other two possible characters in two. As you can see, that’s a 
bit much for our game, given that we want to have lower stats across the board. So, what 
formula will we use? A common convention of dungeon crawlers is to make it so that 
every attack that lands results in at least one point of damage. To keep it simple, attack 
and defense will correlate on a 1:1 basis in our game. That is to say, if the player has an 
attack equal to his/her enemy’s defense, he/she will deal 1 damage. Players deal damage 
equal to the attack advantage that they possess. So, if the player has a 10 ATK and strikes 
at an enemy having a 4 DEF, he/she will deal 6 damage.
With all of that said, head over to the Skills tab and find the Attack skill (the very first 
one in the list) and change the formula from its default to the following:
 a.atk > b.def ? a.atk - b.def : 1
If you have some programming experience, you will recognize the preceding as a 
ternary expression. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it is another way to 
express an if/then relationship. The preceding could be written out as follows:
• 
if a.atk > b.def
• 
then a.atk - b.def
• 
else 1
So, if the attacker has more ATK than the defender has DEF, he/she inflicts damage 
equal to the difference between his/her ATK and the defender’s DEF. Otherwise, the 
player inflicts a single point of damage. Using the previous example (monster ATK of 10, 
player DEF of 5), our player would only take 5 HP of damage per monster attack. This is a 
lot more manageable. For magic, we’ll have similar formulas, with the caveat that we will 
be designing enemies to have far less MDF than they have DEF. That helps to balance the 
fact of Feylia having to use MP for her stronger attacks, in contrast to Palnor and Gust, 
who can use physical attacks to much greater effect. While we’re on the topic of spells, 
take a look at Table 3-1, to see the list of spells that Gust and Feylia share.

■Note  I will cover how to create the Return spell effect in Chapter 4, when we create a 
consumable item with the same effect.
Of course, Feylia wouldn’t be much of a spellcaster if she didn’t have some spells 
of her own. In the interest of economy of space, I’ll provide the rest of her spell list in 
Tables 3-2 and 3-3. I’ll be covering how to enter these spells into the Database in the next 
few pages.

Of course, all this talk of spells begs the question: How do we give Gust and Feylia 
their spells? The easiest way is to edit the appropriate Skills lists (that’s a section in the 
Classes tab for each individual class created) and grant them at certain level intervals. 
You could have Gust learn his spell allotment at Level 5. Feylia would start the game with 
those spells. At Level 5, Feylia could learn the second tier of magic spells (Blaze through 
Sleep in Table 3-2). Then, she could learn every other spell when she reaches Level 10. 
The harder way will be discussed much later in the chapter, as an additional exercise. 
(Hint: It involves using scrolls.) Purge the Skills tab, except for Attack and Guard, and 
then take some time to add the 18 spells to the Database, before moving on. Following are 
some tips that will help you to create them correctly:
• 
The Damage section of the Skills tab contains the damage type 
(which also includes HP and MP recovery, so it’s useful for 
healing skills as well), element (this is where you would put 
Fire, Ice, or Lightning), damage formula (where you can put the 
formula for a spell, where applicable), Variance (which I set to 0 
for all spells), and Critical (which determines whether or not a 
skill can do critical damage; I set that to Yes for every spell with a 
damage formula).
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
47
• 
For spells that inflict a status effect, you set said status effect via 
the Effects section. A right-click (or double left-click) will bring 
up the Effects menu, which has many effects that can be added to 
a skill. What you’re looking for is the Add State Effect. Then, you 
need only change the percent chance of the state being applied to 
the one listed in the previous tables (so, 70% for poison, and 90% 
for sleep).
• 
Scope is self-explanatory, in most cases. The one exception in the 
entire list of spells is Return, which should have a scope of None.
• 
Occasion is also fairly simple. Spells that deal damage (or inflict 
negative status effects) to enemies should only be usable on the 
Battle Screen. Return should be used only from the Menu Screen 
and every other spell should Always be usable.
• 
The Message section is neat, if you wish to customize the message 
shown by the game when the player uses a spell. However, for the 
sake of expediency, I just use the “casts *!” button for each spell, to 
set the relevant message automatically.
■
■Note  Make sure to give Feylia her six starting spells. As mentioned previously, that can 
be done through the Skills to Learn section of the Classes tab. Set the Level to 1, so that 
Feylia has immediate access to these spells.
The Enemies of the Upper Catacombs
Now, I will discuss the first two monsters of our game. As we want them to appear on the 
dungeon’s first level, it stands to reason that we cannot make them too strong, lest they 
wipe out our player as soon as he/she starts playing. That would not be fun at all. Table 3-4  
has a helpful breakdown of the monsters’ stats and their damage type. Table 3-5 lists the 
experience and the gold the player receives when defeating the monsters.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
48
■
■Note  Unless otherwise specified, I will use the self-named battle sprites for each 
enemy in our game. So, the Slime enemy uses the stock Slime graphic, and the Rat uses 
its own graphic.
Both of those monsters use only the Attack skill. Note that we didn’t really provide 
our game’s armor any special properties with regard to elemental resistances and/
or weaknesses. I will cover that later in the chapter, when I discuss accessories in the 
dungeon. Remember: We’re trying to keep the game as simple as possible. Make your way 
to the Enemies tab in the Database and plug in the stats for both enemies accordingly. 
Name and Parameters (MHP, MMP, etc.) are General Settings. Hit Rate, Evasion Rate, and 
Attack Element are Traits. You can set an enemy’s experience and gold in the Rewards 
section, and usable skills are set in the Action Patterns section. Because every enemy 
defaults to using the Attack skill, no changes are necessary for our two enemies in that 
respect.
Next, switch over to the Troops tab. Here, we’re going to create two troops: one for 
each enemy type (otherwise, we’d have no way of creating the event encounters). To 
create a new troop, do the following:
• 
Find the scrollable list of enemies in the right-hand portion of the 
Troops menu.
• 
Left-click the enemy you would like to add to the troop and then 
click < Add. 
• 
You can manually name the troop or have RMMV auto-name it. 
For later levels, we’ll have troops of multiple enemies, but for now, just have a troop 
with a single Slime and another with a single Rat. After all of that, it’s actually pretty easy 
to add the roaming encounters to the map. To make a roaming monster encounter that 
minds its own business until the player runs into it (or inadvertently runs into the player), 
use the following parameters.

■
■Note  You could always just fall back to RMMV’s default random encounter system, 
easily accessible within a map’s Properties menu. I’m just taking the opportunity with this 
game to use a less commonly used encounter system. There isn’t really a right or a wrong 
way to create encounters in RPGs. It’s all a matter of taste.
That’s it! Because you want multiple Slimes and Rats on the map, you can copy 
and paste the original events accordingly. We want the encounters to re-spawn at some 
point, so that the player can use them to get stronger and gain more experience if he/she 
so desires. So, if the player wins, we erase the event temporarily. When Erase Event is 
used, the affected event ceases to exist, until the player leaves the map. (Events will also 
re-spawn if the player saves the game and reloads. This is a quirk that can be controlled 
via the use of scripting or heavy eventing. Consider this as a challenge that you can 
undertake when you gain more experience with RMMV. So, when the player returns to 
this level, he/she will find that the monsters have returned as well.
■
■Note  You could also use a self-switch conditional on a second event page, to remove 
the monster permanently after it is defeated. In that case, you would replace Erase Event 
with Control Self Switch. Just keep in mind that the players have to have a way to gain more 
experience and gold, or they might find themselves unable to get past a certain point.

Importing Assets to RMMV
As mentioned while creating our monster events, there is a Rat graphic we can use for 
events, but it is not included in default projects of RMMV. Instead, it is included in a 
bonus folder called BaseResource. So, how do we add the relevant sprite sheet to RMMV? 
Let me walk you through the process.
• 
First, you need to locate and open the BaseResource folder. It 
should be in the same ZIP file where the RMMV setup file is 
located.
• 
Next, open the img folder. 
• 
You should be looking at several folders now. Open the folder 
named character.
• 
Here we are! The sprite sheet called SF_Monster.png is the one we 
will add to our game. Right-click on it and select Copy.
• 
Now, find your current project file. The easiest way to find the 
directory path in Windows 7 is to click on Open Project in the 
RMMV file menu. If this game is your most recent project, then 
you will be browsing the relevant project folder by doing so.
• 
While in your project folder, find the img folder, and then the 
character folder. If you decided to do this through the Open 
Project prompt, you will see that the character folder is seemingly 
empty. This is normal as that folder has no project files. 
• 
Paste the SF_Monster.png sprite sheet to your project’s character 
folder.
If you have executed these steps correctly, you should now be able to see the  
SF_Monster sprite set every time the engine prompts you to choose a sprite (such 
as for an event). From there, it’s as easy as finding your Rat events and replacing the 
placeholder graphic with the correct one. See Figure 3-4 for how it should look within 
RMMV once you have added the new sprite sheet.

The Blocking Door
Next, we must create the door sealing off the northern part of the catacombs. Because we 
want the player to obtain the Catacomb Key before being able to open the door, the door 
event will have two pages. Figure 3-5 will contain the details for page 1 of the door event. 
Figure 3-6 will contain the details for page 2 of the door event.

While the player does not possess the key, he/she will receive a description of the 
door. When the Catacomb Key is acquired, the player can open the door. This event is a 
tweaked version of the Quick Door Event present within RMMV. Note that the door event 
has no Transfer Event. It is trivial to transfer the player beyond the wall to the other side of 
the level, but I do something a little different. Two wall tiles separate the player from the 
northern half of the catacombs once he/she has opened the door. We can use events with 
Above characters priority to take on the appearance of wall tiles and let the player pass 
under them. How?
Creating Wall Tiles That the Player Can Pass 
Through
By creating wall tiles that allow the player to pass through them, we can (among other 
uses) create secret passages that remain unseen by players who are not so perceptive. In 
this case, we want to make it so that the player can pass through the doorway leading to 
the rest of the level. We can use wall tiles to the same effect. Here’s how we can do that:
• 
Go to the Tilesets tab of the Database and find the Dungeon 
tileset in the list at the left part of the section. 
• 
Once there, find D: in the Graphics section. Note how it is entirely 
blank. Click the “…” button and select the Dungeon_A4 tileset.
• 
With that done, you can now use wall tiles from the Dungeon 
tileset as event graphics.
• 
Next, find the spot where you want to place a wall tile. Right-
click to create a new event. Use an identical graphic to that of 
the surrounding walls and give the event a Priority of Above 
Characters. Its Contents will be completely empty. See Figure 3-7 
for a screenshot of the finished result.

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
54
■
■Note  Make sure you place floor tiles beneath the event graphics! As some tiles in 
RMMV are impassable, you want to make sure that the tiles under your special wall tile 
events are passable. An easy way to check if you have tiles beneath your graphic events is 
to switch to Map Mode, which turns events translucent.
The Treasure Room
As noted near the start of the chapter, we have a treasure room on the map that contains 
four chests. If the player interacts with the small gap (Figure 3-8) in the northwestern wall 
of the catacombs, he/she will find the passage that leads to the treasure room.

This event has the following behavior:

The first time players press the Action button while facing the 
secret passage event, they will receive a message notifying them 
that they have found a secret entrance.
• 
The screen will fade out and players will be transferred to the 
passage’s exit near the four chests. The None after the destination 
coordinates designates that Fade is turned off for that particular 
Transfer Event.

• 
We flip a self-switch that is required by page 2 of this event.

Finally, we use Fadein Screen to end the fade effect caused by 
Fadeout Screen.
• 
The second and subsequent times at which players interact with 
this event, they will be transferred immediately, without any of 
the extra lines used in page 1.
The graphic that will be used for the revealed passage (page 2 of this event) is the 
Entrance A(Top Half A) tile in tab B of the Dungeon tileset. Figure 3-9 displays which tile 
we’ll be using.

As for the contents of the chests themselves, this is where we can have some fun with 
the fact that there are three playable characters.
Creating Chests with Contents Dependent on 
Characters
It wouldn’t do much good for Palnor to find a spell scroll. In the same way, Feylia (or 
Gust, for that matter) wouldn’t be too happy to find a two-handed axe. To make a chest 
having differing contents dependent on the player’s character, we can adapt the Quick 
Treasure Chest Event (accessible quickly by pressing Ctrl+3 after left-clicking the square 
on which you wish to add your event). If we were to use the Quick Treasure Chest Event to 
create a chest with 0 Gold (functionally empty), it would look like the following:

So, what we want to do is copy the first page two times. Then, each of the first 
three pages will have a character conditional. For example, page 1 will require that the 
Palnor switch be on, while page 2 will require the Gust switch to be on. Page 3, logically, 
would run if the Feylia switch were on. In that way, we can give each character the most 
appropriate treasure! For the sake of brevity, I will merely show what should change in 
each of the first three pages, based on what we want each character to retrieve from the 
chest. For this exercise, let’s edit the upper-left treasure chest.

Split the following rewards among the three other treasure chests:

• 
Studded Leather Armor
With that said and done, the last thing left to do for Level 1 is to create a Parallel 
Process event that can cover the transfer events for the two staircases in the level. While 
we have yet to create Level 2, we can prepare the event beforehand, so that it only needs 
us to add the appropriate Transfer Player event command once we’re ready. Without 
further ado, here’s the relevant event that will cover the transfer events for both staircases:
Trigger: Parallel Process
Control Variables: #0019 X = Max X of Player
Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player

■
■Note  The Priority setting of a Parallel event is essentially pointless. The same is largely 
true of the Priority setting of Autorun events.
I like to place Parallel events in otherwise unreachable locations. That way, I can 
assure myself that the player cannot attempt to interact with them directly. It’s not really 
necessary to do this, but that’s how I do it. With that, I could say that we’re done with the 
chapter, but I do have one very broad area left to cover.
Creating the Spell Scrolls
Much earlier in the chapter, I hinted that we would be creating spell scrolls from which 
Feylia and Gust could learn new spells. This particular exercise is too nuanced for bullets 
to do it justice. As you have seen in your time working with RMMV (which I’ll cover in 
greater detail in Chapter 4), Items have an Effects section that works much like Features 
do for Actors and Classes, and Traits for Weapons and Armors. The Effect we’re interested 
in is Learn Skill, which is located in the Others tab of the Effects dialog menu, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
60
Considerations
You would think that creating a spell scroll would be as easy as selecting the skill you 
wish the scroll to impart and then pressing OK. You’d be wrong. Why? Well, what stops 
Palnor from reading any spell scroll, or Gust from reading scrolls holding spells he’s not 
supposed to be able to learn? That’s the main worry. There are two ways to work around 
those issues.
	
1.	
Police where spell scrolls can be acquired: All things 
considered, that shouldn’t be too hard to do. Our game  
has three sources of item acquisition, and none of them  
is random. 
a.	
Shops: The player can acquire spell scrolls from the 
Magic Shop. We can use the same principle we apply to 
treasure chests: having dedicated pages (or conditional 
branches) for each of the characters. Palnor will receive 
little more than a few words of conversation, but Gust 
and Feylia will be able to buy spells (Feylia can also buy 
staves). So, we make it so that Gust can only buy spell 
scrolls for the spells he can learn and then give Feylia the 
entire inventory.
b.	
Enemy loot drops: While neither the Rat nor the Slime 
drops any items, the same will not be true of enemies 
discussed in later chapters. Because we can’t make loot 
drops discriminate among players, the best idea would 
be to make it so that enemies cannot drop scrolls.
Figure 3-11.  The Others tab of the Effects dialog menu
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
61
c.	
Treasure Chests: This is pretty much self-explanatory. 
All we have to do is make chests with contents that differ, 
based on the player opening them.
	
2.	
Use common events to flesh out spell scroll behavior.
The second method is the best way to go about this situation. The first method (of 
policing) will be pretty much impossible, when I introduce a certain thing in Chapter 4. 
There are a total of 18 spells in our game. This is how they break down:
• 
Palnor cannot learn any of the 18 spells. So, if he were to 
somehow acquire and use a scroll, it would return an error 
message and not be consumed.
• 
Gust can learn the first 6 spells in the game. If he somehow gets 
his hands on a scroll containing a spell in the latter 12, he should 
not be able to learn the spell that it contains.
• 
Feylia starts with the first 6 spells in the game and can learn 
the other 12 via spell scrolls whenever she gains access to them 
(either by finding one in a treasure chest or by buying it from the 
Magic Shop).
In every case, error messages should be returned if the player character cannot 
learn a spell (either because he/she is not allowed or because he/she already possesses 
knowledge of it). We can use the individual character switches for conditional branches, 
and we have established that there are two categories of spells.
Eventing the Spell Scrolls
So, here’s the event code for LearnFire, the common event that governs the Scroll of Fire 
item (we’ll create the item in the next page). Fire is a spell that Gust can learn but Feylia 
already possesses. Common events are a variant of events that can be used for (among 
other things) adding special effects to items. Make your way to the Common Events tab in 
the Database and use the following event code for the LearnFire common event:
Trigger: None
If: Palnor is ON
  Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :    : You open the scroll, but can't make heads or tails
  :    : of what is written on it.
  
: End
If: Gust is ON
  If: Gust has learned Fire
    Text: None, Window, Bottom
    :    : You already know that spell! 
    
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
62
   : Else
    Change Items: Scroll of Fire - 1
    Change Skills: Gust, + Fire
    
  : End
  
: End
If: Feylia is ON
  Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :    : You already know that spell!
  
: End

Of course, this common event is useless unless we actually create the Scroll of Fire 
item, so let’s do that real quick. Head over to the Items tab and see Figure 3-12.
Figure 3-12.  General Settings for the Scroll of Fire item
Create that item in slot 15 of the Items tab and then copy it 17 times, to provide a 
scroll for each of our 18 spells. If done correctly, scrolls should be occupying slots 15 
through 32 in the Items tab of your Database. The only things that change between 
scrolls are their name, description, price, and called common event. Thus, it’s far quicker 
just to copy and fix, rather than transcribe the same thing 18 times. You can also copy 
the LearnFire common event 5 times and make the appropriate changes for each new 
spell. As you can imagine, the Scroll of Fire calls the LearnFire common event (this is yet 
another possible item Effect) when used from the menu.
■
■Note  I organized the scrolls and their associated common events in the order that I 
display them in this chapter’s tables. You should do the same, as it allows you to more easily 
separate the spells both Gust and Feylia can learn from those that only Feylia can learn.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ The Upper Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
63
Now, let’s have a spell from the second category, that is, a spell that only Feylia may 
learn. This is the LearnBlaze common event.
Trigger: None
If: Feylia is OFF
  Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :    : You open the scroll, but can't make heads or tails
  :    : of what is written on it.
  
: End
If: Feylia is ON
  If: Feylia has learned Blaze
    Text: None, Window, Bottom
    :    : You already know that spell!
    
   : Else
    Change Items: Scroll of Blaze - 1
    Change Skills: Feylia, + Blaze
    
  : End
  
: End
A quick look at both of the common events shown here reveals both similarities and 
differences. In the first category of spells, we check to see if the player is playing as Palnor. 
If he/she is, then we return an error message when the scroll is used. If the player is playing 
as Gust, the game then checks to see if Gust has learned Fire. If he has, then the game 
will note the fact. Otherwise, a Scroll of Fire will be consumed, and Gust will learn Fire. 
Because Feylia starts with Fire, we can skip the check and return the “skill already known” 
error message. In the second category of spells, we only have to check to see if the player is 
not playing as Feylia—because neither Gust nor Palnor can learn these spells—and then 
return an error message if he/she isn’t. If he/she is, we perform the same check we did for 
Gust in the first category of spells, to see, this time, if Feylia already knows the spell.
■
■Note  This is probably the most appropriate time to finish up the 12 common events 
you’ll have to match with Feylia’s spell scrolls. It’s good practice to go through and do this 
yourself or, if you’re in a hurry, you can use the files from the book’s download package.

Summary
During the course of this chapter, we created the upper half of the catacombs of Eagle’s 
Crossing. We added monster encounters that move around the map; a simple level 
objective in the form of a key, which that the player requires to complete progress; and a 
secret treasure room that rewards the player for exploring his/her surroundings in great 
detail. We even tackled the issue of teaching spells to our player characters. In the next 
chapter, we will complete Eagle’s Crossing.

Chapter 4
Populating Eagle’s Crossing
While a part of the very first chapter of this book was dedicated to creating the various 
locations within Eagle’s Crossing, now’s the perfect time to populate the town’s shops 
and add nonplayer characters (NPCs), as needed. I opted to reserve doing this until the 
fourth chapter and not the third, because it mirrors my personal dungeon crawler play 
style: rush right into the dungeon and then return to town, as low HP or an excess of loot 
demands. So, how am I going to go about this? There are four buildings, so let’s tackle 
them in clockwise fashion, starting from the Equipment Shop in the upper-left corner.
Populating the Equipment Shop
In this section, we’ll flesh out the two NPCs that will be running the Equipment Shop. 
Recall from Chapter 1 that our NPCs are graphics, with no event contents to speak of. 
Before we begin, it would be good to take two things into consideration.
• 
Do I want the player to be able to see the entire shop inventory 
from the start of the game? In most role-playing games (RPGs), 
our dungeon crawler included, the actual deterrent to being 
able to get the best equipment from the start of the game isn’t 
availability but, rather, currency. So, it doesn’t matter whether 
we show off everything that the player can buy. If anything, it 
could provide a degree of impetus for him/her to want to begin 
dungeon crawling, to be able to buy the better stuff.
• 
Do I show off the whole shop inventory for all characters? 
I’m inclined to answer this with a no. Take the Weapon Shop, for 
example. There’s no point in Gust seeing two-handed weapons 
that he cannot use. Feylia is an extreme case and should only 
see daggers (we’ll be selling the four staff weapons at the Magic 
Shop). Palnor wouldn’t want to see bows that he cannot use 
either.
On that note, here’s the event for the Weapon Shop NPC.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Populating Eagle’s Crossing
66
■
■Note  Unless strictly necessary, I won’t mention the graphics for NPCs in my event code. 
Feel free to use the Character Generator to make your own fresh faces. Alternately,  
if you’d rather go stock, I’m quite partial to the four People graphic sets for shop NPCs.  
They contain quite a few sprites that could conceivably be shopkeepers and/or merchants.

For space considerations, I used only weapons of the Wooden tier to show what each 
character would see in the Weapon Shop. It shouldn’t take you more than a few minutes 
to fill out each character’s Weapon Shop inventory, despite the fact that both Palnor and 
Gust have a whopping 30 (!) possible weapons.

■
■Note  If you can’t stand the sight of so many items on the same shopping list, you could 
use Show Choices to split the inventory into more manageable chunks. See the following 
code for a sample event.
Show Choices: Wood and Copper, Bronze and Iron, Steel and Mythril, Leave
: When Wood and Copper
  Comment: Insert relevant weapons in this shop.

  Comment: Insert relevant weapons in this shop.
  
: When Steel and Mythril
  Comment: Insert relevant weapons in this shop.
  
: When Leave
  
: End

I used a comment in place of a Shop Processing event command for the sake of 
saving space. The Armor Shop works in much the same way, so I’ll skip elaborating on it 
entirely. You can just copy the Weapon Shop NPC event contents and change the Shop 
Processing contents appropriately. Just remember that Feylia can only use Light Armor, 
Gust can use Light Armor and Medium Armor, and Palnor can use any type of armor.
Populating the Pub
Tavern, pub, inn. No matter which of the three names the given locale has in a game, they 
all have the same purpose: to serve as a place for the player character to recover from 
battle wounds. The pub of Eagle’s Crossing allows players to rest (free of charge) and even 
recruit a companion to aid them in their quest for the sacred artifact. See Figure 4-1 of 
how the Pub should look after you are done with this section.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Populating Eagle’s Crossing
68
There are six events in the pub. I’ll list them in order of importance, from most to 
least (relatively speaking, of course).
• 
The two NPCs sitting at the Pub’s tables will serve as potential 
companions for the player.
• 
The NPC at the right side of the counter will alert the player to 
potential companions, if he/she does not yet have one. If the 
player does have a companion, the NPC will allow the player to 
dismiss them, upon which they will return to their tables. 
• 
The NPC at the left side of the counter is the innkeeper. She 
allows the player to rest, restoring their character’s HP and MP 
completely free of charge.
• 
There is a transfer event placed one square below the entrance to 
the Pub. If you didn’t add this back in Chapter 1, now would be 
the time to do so. 
• 
Last, the stairs trigger an event when stepped on, prompting the 
player to speak to the innkeeper, if he/she wishes to rest.

Creating Our Companions
We can create our game’s pair of companions in much the same way we made our three 
main characters. First, let’s create the new classes for our would-be companions. If you 
need a refresher, you’ll want to go back to Chapter 2 and reread what was covered in the

that’s because they are. The Fighter is basically a toned-down version of the Warrior, 
while the Apprentice is, likewise, a weaker version of the Mage, with most of the features 
of their respective “parent” classes. Speaking of features, please take a look at Table 4-2.

The two companions, while not as strong or able as the player character, are both 
worthy allies when the going gets tough. Go to the Classes tab and create them in the 
same way you created the first three classes in Chapter 2. Afterward, go to the Actors tab 
and give both of the player’s potential companions appropriate graphics and starting 
equipment. See Figure 4-2.

■Note  You can find the sprites for both companion characters in the Actor1 graphic set.
Eventing Our Companions
With that out of the way, we can get started with eventing the logic concerning our 
companions. Keep in mind that the player will only be able to have one companion with 
him/her at a time. Both of the companions use a similar two-page event that covers the 
following behavior: 
• 
If the player has no companions, the pair will offer their services 
to him/her. Saying “no” does nothing, but saying “yes” adds the 
companion the player is talking to to the player’s party, removing 
his/her sprite from the Pub. 
• 
If the player has already recruited one of the companions, the 
other companion will point out the fact and ask the player to 
return once he/she has dismissed his/her companion.

■Note  Before starting this section in earnest, take a moment to go to the System tab 
of the Database and make sure that the Show Player Followers check box is unchecked. 
While being able to see your full party on the screen is cool, this is also subject to collision 
detection and could interfere with events. I feel it is better to keep it nice and simple with 
the single visible character.
In any case, here is the event code for Wrendale the Fighter:

You can copy this same event for Anabeth the Apprentice. Her sprite set is the second 
one (of four) in the lower row of Actor3. Because Anabeth isn’t as concerned with fame or 
glory, you can replace Wrendale’s greetings with: Greetings. My name is Anabeth. I 
have come to Eagle's Crossing in search of knowledge. Will you allow me to 
quest with you?
■
■Tip  You can use the Preview button in the Show Text command to ensure that your lines 
are set up correctly and are not stretching beyond the visible part of the text box.
Besides that, just tweak the event, as required, and use a different switch (since 
Wrendale was switch 0005, Anabeth will be switch 0006) for Anabeth, and you’re set!
Creating the Dismissal NPC
Having a companion is all well and good, but what if the player wanted to switch? You could 
create an item with a common event that allows the player to swap characters, but let’s 
keep things simple. Let’s create an NPC that handles the dismissal of the player’s current 
companion, so that he/she can hire the other one. Here’s the event code for the NPC:

  


Not much to say about this NPC. If the player has no companion, he/she will speak 
of the two adventurers who arrived at Eagle’s Crossing recently. If he/she does have a 
companion, he/she can speak with the NPC to dismiss the companion. The companion 
will then sit back down at his or her starting position at the inn, waiting for the next time 
that he/she can aid the player in his/her quest.
■
■Note  Keep in mind that having an extra party member will affect your game’s balance. 
Everything is easier when you have two characters instead of one. I’ll be taking the 
companion’s presence into account, starting from Chapter 6. In other words, once the player 
finds him-/herself in the Caves, they’re probably going to want the extra help.
With that done, we can call this section concluded. The next section will tackle 
completing the events for the town buildings. (Remember that we created the NPCs back 
in Chapter 1 but left them as little more than graphics, without any event commands 
governing them.)

Creating the Innkeeper NPC
Thanks to the Inn Quick Event in RMMV, this action barely merits a section. What I am 
going to do here is use the Quick Event to create an inn that costs no gold to rest at and 
then polish the event so that it doesn’t read weird. See, the innkeeper’s first Show Text 
event command announces the price of the inn and asks if the player wants to rest. It’s 
a little silly for anyone to say: “It costs 0 G to rest here….” Besides, it will make the event 
shorter and neater. Take a look at the code to see the polished result.
Priority: Same as characters
Trigger: Action Button
Text: None, Window, Bottom

Looks a lot neater, if I do say so myself. That leaves the transfer event and the 
staircase event. First, if you haven’t already, let’s create the transfer event. (If you have, 
then skip to the paragraph past the Note below). Right-click the square at 8,12, create a 
new event, and add the following event code to the newly created event.
Trigger: Player Touch
Play SE: Move1 (90, 100, 0)
Transfer Player: Eagle's Crossing  (18,11)

■
■Note  Alternatively, you could use the Quick Transfer Event option to create the transfer 
event as well. As a reminder, you can find quick events for doors, chests, transfer events, 
and inns via the menu that opens when you right-click a square in Event Editing Mode.

Given that we have no actual second floor map for our game’s Pub, we should at least 
have an event concerning the staircase. This is a rather brief text event that tells the player 
to go talk to the innkeeper if he/she wishes to rest.
Priority: Below characters

With that, we’re done with the Pub. Next, we will visit the Magic Shop, where Feylia 
will make most of her purchases.
Populating the Magic Shop
The Magic Shop is host to a single, enigmatic NPC that sells spell scrolls and (in Feylia’s 
case) staves. You can see the Magic Shop NPC event code below:
Text: None, Window, Bottom

If: Palnor is ON
  Text: None, Window, Bottom

  
: End

In the preceding event, if Palnor visits the Magic Shop, the NPC will note that there’s 
not much point to him being there. If Gust or Feylia visits, he will bring appropriate wares 
for the respective characters. Not much else to say about this one. Create the appropriate 
transfer event for this area. (You can copy the transfer event we used for the Pub, but 
don’t forget to change the destination!) Now let’s move on to the last of Eagle’s Crossing 
locales.
Populating the Item Shop
You may recall from Chapter 1 that we did not make an interior for the Item Shop. Unlike 
the other shops, we can have a single unified inventory for both Gust and Feylia. In 
Palnor’s case, we could consider having a more abbreviated inventory. As we haven’t 
covered what consumable items will exist in our game (with the sole exception of the first 
two potions), Table 4-3 will provide the needed information. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Populating Eagle’s Crossing
77
■
■Note  An item that is used on a dead ally has to have a scope of One Ally (Dead). 
Similarly, an item that is used on all dead allies should have a scope of All Allies (Dead). 
Failing to change the scope appropriately will render your revival item useless.
As you can see, our game has 14 consumable items that will be available for sale at 
the Item Shop. Palnor’s inventory should probably not have items that restore MP (if you 
decide to split the inventories, depending on the active player character). In that case, 
he will be able to buy 9 of the items. Edit the event we created in Chapter 1 and add a 
relevant Shop Processing event command that allows the Item Shop to sell the above 
items to the player. You can find the completed version of this event in the source code 
download for this book.

Status Effects
Looking at Table 4-3, you probably noticed several items dedicated to curing status 
effects. Additionally, we created some spells in the previous chapter to cause Poison and 
Sleep. Later on, we’ll have enemies that can inflict status effects as well. As such, it’s about 
time to organize our game’s status effects. Follow these steps: 
• 
Go to the States tab in the Database.
• 
Erase Rage, Confusion, and Fascination by right-clicking and then 
pressing Clear (alternately, left-click to select and then press the 
Del key).
• 
Toggle the Remove at battle end checkbox for Poison and reduce 
the negative HP regeneration Trait to -5% (from its base of -10%).
• 
Move up Sleep to slot 0007 by copying and then deleting the 
original in slot 0010.
Now, let’s create the missing Paralysis state in slot 0008. The Name is Paralysis and 
the state icon will be index number 9. Set the Restriction to Cannot move. In the Removal 
Conditions section, toggle the Remove at battle end checkbox, set the Auto-removal 
Timing to Action End and set the Duration in Turns to 5 ~ 9. In Messages, you want the 
game to display “is paralyzed!” when an actor or enemy is inflicted with Paralysis, “can’t 
move!” if the state persists, and “is no longer paralyzed!” for when the state is removed. 
Lastly, in Traits, add the Evasion Rate Ex-Parameter and set it to -100% (like the stock 
Sleep state). With that said and done, our game’s states have been organized. Take a bit 
to add the relevant Add State/Remove State effects to items and spells as appropriate 
(pertinently, you’ll want Panaceas and the Cleanse Spell to remove Poison, Blind, Silence, 
Sleep, and Paralysis).
You may be wondering why I didn’t just do this when I introduced the status effect 
inducing spells. I could have, but I would’ve needed to make the items anyway. Best to get 
it done in one fell swoop, in my opinion.
Companions and Shops
Now, then, what happens if we want our companion to buy equipment from the 
Equipment Shop? Our events for our shops only take into account the player character. 
This is all well and good if Wrendale is hired with Palnor or Gust or Anabeth is hired with 
Feylia. But what happens if the player hires Wrendale with Feylia, for example? The player 
will only be able to buy daggers and light armor, although he/she is more than capable 
of using other weapons and armor. So, how do we remedy this? The easiest way is to add 
a second page that requires that Companion be set to ON. Here’s what the Weapon Shop 
event could look like.
Text: None, Window, Bottom
:    : Welcome to the weapon shop! I see that you have
:    : a companion with you. Who will shop today?
Show Choices: Me, My Companion, Nevermind (Window, Right, #1, #3)

    

■Tip  To save some time when adding the companion’s shop inventories, keep in mind 
that Wrendale and Gust share the same weapon permissions, save for bows, while Anabeth 
and Feylia have identical weapon permissions. For armor, Wrendale and Anabeth share the 
same permissions as Gust and Feylia, respectively.
The Magic Shop is even easier, as Anabeth cannot learn new spells, and Wrendale 
has no use for the shop, much like Palnor. When Anabeth is in the party, she only has to 
have access to the four different types of staves. Now, let’s discuss the Return Crystal.
Creating the Return Item
Every other item in Table 4-3 should be easy to add to the Database. However, the Return 
Crystal requires a little more work. As promised in the previous chapter, we are going to 
discuss how to create an effect that allows the player to return to town from the dungeon. 
Essentially, you’ll need a common event to handle logic and the item/skill to hold the 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Populating Eagle’s Crossing
80
common event (of which we have both an item and a skill). In practice, you’ll want two 
different common events (one for the spell version of Return and one for the item version). 
In its simplest form, you can create a Return event with a single line of code, like so: 
Transfer Player: Eagle's Crossing (12,13) (Direction: Down)
However, that brings a rather important problem: A total lack of error checking. 
Is the player already in town? He/She will still be able to use the item/skill, which is a 
waste of resources. So, we should have a switch (I call it InTown) that is on when the 
player is within Eagle’s Crossing and off when he/she is in the dungeon. Then, we can 
use conditional branches to cover both possibilities. For the item version of Return, 
you’ll want to make sure the item in question has Consume set to No. Then, you can use 
a Change Items event command to reduce the number of Return Crystals by 1 when it is 
successfully used. Basically, what we’re doing here is shifting the Consume property from 
the actual item to its associated event. For the item event, the player is asked whether 
he/she wishes to return to town and given a yes/no option. We only want the player to 
lose a Return Crystal when he/she chooses yes. For the spell event, the player is instantly 
returned to town. Here are the relevant common events.
Name: ReturnItem
Trigger: None
If: InTown is ON
  Text: None, Window, Bottom

Creating a Return Portal
So, as cool as the Return event is, it still has some room for improvement. What if we want 
our Return effect to create a portal in town that the player can use to quickly pop back to 
his/her previous location in the dungeon? To accomplish that, we’ll have to add a portal 
event to Eagle’s Crossing and declare a few new variables and switches. We’ll place the 
portal event right in the middle of Eagle’s Crossing (precisely where the player arrives via 
the Return spell, as a matter of fact). Here’s the portal event code:
Condition: Switch 0007 Return

  
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Populating Eagle’s Crossing
82
: When No
  
: End

The preceding code requires some explanation. First, we’ll have a new switch called 
Return that flips on when the player uses a Return Crystal or the Return spell. When that 
switch is on, a portal appears in the middle of Eagle’s Crossing. The player can interact 
with the portal by standing directly on it and pressing the Action button. The game will 
ask the player if he/she wishes to return to the dungeon. A yes will toggle off the Return 
and InTown switches and transfer the player to their previous location in the dungeon. 
Because the player can use a Return effect anywhere inside of the dungeon, we have 
to know exactly from where the player returned. For this, we use the Designation with 
variables option within the Transfer Player event command. To use that option, we have 
to create two new variables to hold another pair of x and y coordinates and a third to hold 
the dungeon map ID. Then, we have to expand our Return common events to account 
for this functionality. Given that the ReturnSpell event is shorter, I will be using that one. 
However, the same principles apply for ReturnItem as well. Look at the following to see 
ReturnSpell in its tweaked form.
Name: ReturnSpell
If: InTown is ON
  Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :    : You're already in town! 
  
: End
If: InTown is OFF
  Control Variables: #0015 ReturnMapID = Map ID
  Control Variables: #0016 ReturnX = Map X of Player
  Control Variables: #0017 ReturnY = Map Y of Player
  Control Switches: #0007 Return = ON
  Control Switches: #0009 InTown = ON
  Play SE: Teleport (90, 100, 0)
  Transfer Player: Eagle's Crossing] (12,12) (Direction: Down)
  
: End

■
■Note   You’ll need to set InTown to on in the initial Autorun event that is triggered when 
the player is transferred from the character select map to Eagle’s Crossing. This prevents 
a niche bug whereby the player can use Return (to essentially nil effect) to town before 
heading down to the dungeon for the first time.

Connecting Eagle’s Crossing to the Upper

Of particular note (mostly because it’s new code) is the transfer event that allows 
the player to enter the dungeon. If it is the first time that the player triggers that transfer 
event, the value of DeepestDungeonFloor will be set to 1, and the player will be sent 
to the dungeon. Storing how far the player has progressed can be useful, if you want 
shopkeepers to reveal their inventory gradually, or you want NPCs to talk about relevant 
events. For instance, take a look at the next section.
The Town Greeter
It’s a dull job, but somebody has to do it. Who else but the town greeter can steer newly 
arrived visitors in the right direction? He stands stoically at 13,11 (one square northeast 
of the Return portal’s event), waiting for player characters to speak with him. At the start 
of the game, he will give the player an overview of the town. As the player progresses, he 
will speak about rumors and other such miscellanea. Each time the player reaches a new 
level of the dungeon, the town greeter will have something new to say. Here are the first 
two pages of this NPC event, which covers the initial meeting and words spoken when the 
player has been to the first level.

Did the town greeter just break the fourth wall? Why, yes, he did. He’s good at that, as 
you’ll see in the course of the rest of the book. With that said and done, this chapter has 
reached its conclusion.
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we finished tweaking Eagle’s Crossing and connected 
it with the dungeon’s first level. In addition, we created two companions for the player’s 
character and a way for the player to return to town instantly from the dungeon. In the 
next chapter, we will create the second level of our game’s dungeon.

Chapter 5
The Lower Catacombs of 
Eagle’s Crossing
In this chapter, we will be working on our dungeon’s second level, the Lower Catacombs. 
A puzzle and stronger enemies will do their best to obstruct our player’s progress.
The Lower Catacombs
The Lower Catacombs contain tombs and effigies of the most illustrious 
individuals of the world. Rumors speak of statues that come to life when 
their masters or their belongings are threatened…
If the player has cleared out the Upper Catacombs in their entirety, the experience 
gained should be just enough to push his/her character to Level 3.
■
■Note  It’s generally a good idea to balance your monsters in later dungeon levels based 
on party size and experience levels.
Thus, it stands to reason that the enemies that the player will face in the Lower 
Catacombs should be stronger as well. Here’s a list of things that I will be covering in this 
chapter.
• 
Making static encounters with a chance of having a single enemy 
or a pair of enemies.
• 
Making a very strong encounter that starts moving when the 
player tries to open one of the chests in the central tomb.
• 
Creating a puzzle that, when solved, allows the player to enter the 
central tomb.
• 
Following from the preceding, we must have several stone slabs 
that give the player hints as to how to solve the puzzle.

What Does the Town Greeter Have to Say?
From now to Chapter 9, every chapter will include this brief section. Basically, I’ll write 
in it what the town greeter has to say about the area in question. This particular blurb 
requires that the DeepestDungeonVariable be set to 2. You can reference the second 
event page of our town greeter nonplayer character (NPC; detailed in the previous 
chapter) to create the following:
You made it to the Lower Catacombs, or so I’ve heard. There are four 
statues that have been there since the day my ancestors created the 
tombs. Mind yourself around them.
Level Overview
The first order of business is to create the map itself. We will use the Dungeon tileset once 
again, with the same battleback (Cobblestones3 and Stone3) and BGM (Dungeon1) as 
the first level, and a map size of 59×47. See Figure 5-1 for a screenshot of the level in its 
entirety.
Figure 5-1.  A screenshot of the Lower Catacombs
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
89
■
■Note  You’re going to notice from here on that my maps will all have a height of 47. That 
was the maximum map height, if you wanted your map to appear on a single screen in 1/2 
scale in RPG Maker VX Ace, assuming your screen resolution was 1440×900. In MV, you’ll 
need to zoom all the way out to 25% thanks to the increased tile size if you want to see the 
whole map on the same screen. As you can see in Figure 5-1, this has the unintended side 
effect of making event graphics too small to see. In any case, the maximum visible area 
(width and height) of a map in RPG Maker is dependent on your monitor’s resolution. So, the 
higher the resolution, the more map tiles you will be able to see. I do it for the sake of the 
screenshots. 
Notable points of interest include the following:
• 
The hole in the lower-right corner of the area that leads down to 
the next level (the Caves).
• 
The smaller tombs on either side of the central tombs. The statues 
are key to figuring out the level’s puzzle.
• 
The central tomb itself. Its entrance is barred by a gate that 
requires the player to correctly figure out the solution to its 
puzzle. Inside, there are a whopping 16 chests, of which only 7 
contain anything. Opening any of them causes the strong enemy 
encounter to activate.
• 
The stone slabs near the staircase up to the Upper Catacombs. 
These hold hints to aid the player in figuring out the level’s puzzle.
• 
The cave terrain in the lower half of the level. The walls use the 
Wall A (Dirt Cave) tile, while the floor uses the Ground A (Dirt 
Cave) tile.
Take some time to draw up the map or load it from the source code download 
package. Once the map is ready, move on to the next section.
Creating Transfer Events for the Upper 
Catacombs
Upper Catacombs? That may be the question you are asking yourself right now. After 
all, are we not in the Lower Catacombs? Well, given the way that I have broken down the 
dungeon chapters, it is more efficient for me to create the transfer events for the previous 
level while discussing the next level (basically because, otherwise, the lower level 
wouldn’t exist for purposes of the staircase leading down).
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing

There are two staircases in the first level of our game. The staircase leading down is 
at 30,1, while the staircase leading to town is at 10,23. You’ll want to place a Parallel event 
somewhere in the Upper Catacombs, to cover these individual instances. As is usual, I 
prefer an otherwise inaccessible location for my Parallel events. Here’s the event code in 
question:
Trigger: Parallel
Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
If: X = 30
  If: Y = 1
    If: Self Switch A is OFF
      Control Variables: #0001 DeepestDungeonFloor = 2
      Control Self Switch: A = ON
      Transfer Player: Level 2 (29,4) (Direction: Down)

      Transfer Player: Level 2 (29,4), (Direction: Down)
      

    

  If: Y = 23
      Control Switches: #0009 InTown = ON
    Transfer Player: Eagle's Crossing (12,4) (Direction: Down)
    
  : End
  
: End

This will allow the player to transition down to the new map and progress within 
the game. So, now you have a constant section to look forward to for each of the next few 
chapters (besides the town greeter blurb). Now, let’s resume our work with the second 
level of our game’s dungeon.
Static Encounters with Variable Enemy Troops 
For the first level of our game, every monster event represented a troop of a single enemy. 
Erring on the side of easy at the start of a game is never a bad idea. However, the game 
will get dull rather quickly if the player is fighting a single enemy (especially later on, 
when he/she accompanied by a companion). One way to add a little diversity to enemy 
encounters is to make the event graphic represent a random number of enemies. How do 
we do this? It’s very simple. I’ll cover this in a few pages. For now, we have to define our 
enemy types for the Lower Catacombs. See Table 5-1.

■Note  Given that there’s no actual Living Statue in RPG Maker MV’s (RMMV’s) stock 
graphics, I use the Soldier battle sprite.
While the enemies are stronger, they award more EXP and gold when defeated. 
The Living Statue enemies are activated when the player opens any of the chests inside 
the central tomb. Table 5-2 includes the item drop list and skills list for each of our new 
enemies.

The Zombie is the first enemy in our game to have another usable skill besides the 
regular attack. Poison Bite has a Pierce-type element and a damage formula identical to 
that of the Attack skill (a.atk > b.def ? a.atk - b.def : 1). True to its name, the 
Poison Bite has a 30% chance of inflicting Poison if it connects with its target. Given that 
this is the first time we add a skill to an enemy, let me walk you through the process.
• 
Create Poison Bite. Remember that you can create new skills 
within the Skills tab. In my Database, Poison Sting is in the 21st 
skill slot.
• 
Go to the Enemies tab and create the Zombie by assigning its 
parameters, rewards, and drops.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
92
• 
Next, look at the Action Patterns section. Right-click and select 
Edit (or double left-click) the slot immediately below Attack.
• 
From the new dialog menu that appears, find the Poison Bite skill, 
and then assign it a rating of 4.
Ratings determine the frequency with which an enemy uses a particular skill. For the 
sake of simplicity, just know that the Zombie will favor using Attack over Poison Bite.
You can also see that I’ve given each enemy at least one possible item drop. This is a 
tendency that I will demonstrate throughout the rest of this book. After all, who doesn’t 
enjoy the chance to get more loot? The Gold Coin is one of three similar items with 
the sole purpose of being sold to get some extra gold. I placed them in the three blank 
slots between the last spell scroll and the Catacomb Key. See Table 5-3 for the new item 
breakdown.

2000 G
■
■Note  By default in RMMV, items sell for half their value. So, to cite an example: If you 
want an item to sell for 500 gold, it must cost 1000 gold.
Now that we have established our level’s enemies, we can actually place them on  
the map.
■
■Note  Don’t forget to create the appropriate troops! You’ll want two troops each for the 
Bats and Zombies. One troop will have a single enemy, while the second will have two of the 
same enemy. The Living Statue only needs a single troop of one enemy.
The upper half of the level (which shares the same tileset as the Upper Catacombs) 
will have Bats. Additionally, we will place a total of four Living Statues in that area (two 
on each side of the area). The Zombies will be located on the lower half of the level 
(which will share the same tileset as the Caves in the next chapter). So, how do we make 
an enemy encounter that has a variable amount of enemies? Let’s look at the event we 
previously created for our Level 1 enemies.

If we use a variable to store a random number and then use that number to check 
against a pair of conditional branches, we can determine how many enemies the troop 
will have. Here’s the event I created for the Bat enemy.

I use a variable named d3 (the shorthand nomenclature for three-sided dice), to 
hold a random number between 1 and 3. Then, I have the game check to see if d3 is less 
than 3 (which means it is equal to 1 or 2). In that case, the player is attacked by one Bat. 
If d3 is equal to 3, the player is attacked by a pair of Bats. Make the same type of event for 
the Zombie enemy and then place it on the map. I placed a total of nine Bats and four 
Zombies in the level. The Living Statue will have a simple encounter event, much like the 
Slimes and Rats of the first level. But, I’ll talk more about our overpowered enemy later in 
the chapter.
Let’s Create a Puzzle!
While the previous blocking door in our game was thwarted by a simple key, this 
particular door will require some more effort. Upon the player interacting with it, the 
door will ask for its value and leave the player to give a number without any hint save 
one: if the player writes in an incorrect answer, the gate will shout: “Incorrect! Seek the 
knowledge of the stone tablets!” We’ll create this puzzle in the same order that the player 
should solve it.
The Stone Tablets
After getting told to seek the stone tablets, the average would-be puzzle solver would try 
to find said tablets. There will be seven of them along the walls at the northern end of the 
level. They all share the graphic displayed in Figure 5-2 and have the same first line of 
“The value of the statues.”
Figure 5-2.  The Monument C graphic from tab B of the Dungeon tileset

Here’s a list of the seven hints that should be spread among the tablets.
• 
From north to south
• 
Each set gives a part/To their number
•

• 
Each side is one number

The Statues and the Gate
We give quite a few hints concerning statues, and that is where the player should head 
next. When all of the hints are examined as a whole, the player should realize that each 
set of statues represents a single three-digit number. Players are to subtract the value of 
the right-hand side from that of the left-hand side to get the gate’s value and solve the 
riddle. The gate event is two pages long. The first page handles the puzzle logic, while the 
second page is the open door event that is triggered after the player successfully solves 
the puzzle.

■Note  An easier way to add the preceding event to your game is by using the Door Quick 
Event and editing it accordingly.
This event uses the Input Number event command, which had not been used up to 
now. As its name states, Input Number allows the player to type in a number of up to X 
digits in size, where X in this case is 3. Then, we check to see if the player has given the 
correct solution (192). If he/she has, the gate opens, allowing him/her to pass into the 
central tomb. Otherwise, the variable will be set to 0 once again, and the player will be 
told to seek the stone tablets.

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
97
How does the player know to solve for 192? Well, taking the hints provided by the 
stone tablets, the right set of statues represents a single three-digit number, while the left 
set of statues represents a second three-digit number. The broken bust counts as zero. 
Thus, the right side is 405, while the left side is 213. The solution is as easy as subtracting 
213 from 405. Last, you may be wondering how this all looks in-game. After all, there’s a 
one-space gap that I didn’t cover with an event. (You may have noticed it in Figure 5-1. I’ll 
be providing a zoomed-in screenshot of it in Figure 5-3.) Take a look at Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3.  A screenshot (left) of the area surrounding the gate in RMMV’s editor and one 
(right) of the area surrounding the gate during an actual play-through
The player wouldn’t know that there’s a wall gap one space above the gate’s event, 
but for the fact that the gap is the only reason he/she can interact with the gate at all. 
Looks pretty neat, if I do say so myself.
■
■Note  As with the Catacomb Key in Level 1, you could award the player some 
experience for solving the gate puzzle. I’d personally give him/her 50 EXP.
The Treasure of the Lower Catacombs
Once players have made their way past the gate, they will find themselves in the central 
tomb. A small opening at the far side of the tomb eventually leads to the entrance to the 
Caves, the third dungeon level of our game. Notably, there are a total of 16 chests ripe for 
the taking. Or are they? There are three types of chests in this room.
	
1.	
Empty chests. Nine of the chests in this room are empty.
	
2.	
Character-specific chests. Three of the chests in this room 
have contents dependent on the player’s character.
	
3.	
Standard chests. Four chests in this room have the same 
contents regardless of the player’s character.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
98
When the player tries to open any of the chests, they will receive a message about 
a “mysterious aura surrounding the chest.” If the player opens the chest, the four Living 
Statues come to life and make their way to the player’s position as fast as they can. Once 
the player has opened a chest, there are no further penalties for opening the other 15. In 
fact, the player will want to bite the bullet and open all of the chests, as they will contain 
items that may keep him/her alive against his/her overly strong foes. I will provide code 
for how a standard chest should look. We have already discussed how to create character-
specific chests, and empty chests are functionally identical to standard chests.

Living Statues are activated. I’ll cover our strong enemies in the next section. For now, 
here’s a list of the treasure to be placed within the seven treasure chests that are meant 
to contain items. Character-specific chest contents are listed in the form X/Y/Z, where X is 
Palnor’s item, Y is Gust’s item, and Z is Feylia’s item.

The Living Statues
It is not uncommon for dungeon crawlers to have trapped chests. While our living 
statue trap is far more subtle than an arrow or a fireball to the face, it still fits under that 
umbrella. The player has to decide whether they fight back or escape the level (preferably 
into the Caves, as retreating into the Upper Catacombs would just perpetuate the 
problem). Given the strength and origin of the statues, it is best if they are permanently 
defeated after the player beats them in battle. You could make them re-spawn, but that 
would be rather cruel. So, where exactly are these living statues located? There are two on 
each side of the level, in the positions displayed in Figure 5-4.

All that is left is to create the Living Statue events themselves. The event will have 
three pages. See Figure 5-5 for a screenshot of the graphic used for the Living Statue 
enemy before I write out the event. You can find this particular graphic in the People3 
graphic set.

Chapter 5 ■ The Lower Catacombs of Eagle’s Crossing
102
There’s not much difference between the Living Statue and our Level 1 enemies once 
the statues activate. The first page covers what happens if the player interacts with one of 
the statues before trying to open one of the central tomb’s chests. The player receives a 
slightly foreboding message, but little else. However, once the Living Statues awaken, they 
will try to converge on the player’s position.
■
■Note   And I do mean try. Unless you have very linear locations, enemies with the 
Approach movement type may get trapped in some place or another trying to reach the 
player’s position.
Unlike every other enemy type that we have created so far, the Living Statue has 
a movement type of Approach. They will also move at a quicker rate than our other 
enemies, making looting the other chests as fast as possible highly imperative for the 
player. With all of that set up, we are done with this level (and, by extension, with this 
chapter).
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we worked on the lower half of the catacombs of Eagle’s 
Crossing. We added monster encounters that have varying amount of enemies, a puzzle 
gate blocking the way to the next level and lots of treasure, and strong enemies that 
activate in response to the player’s actions (opening treasure chests). In the next chapter, I 
will cover the Caves of our dungeon crawler.

Chapter 6
The Caves
In this chapter, we will be working on our dungeon’s third level, the Caves. Our game’s 
first boss monster will be encountered here, and the player will have to deal with flipping 
switches to reach a chest containing an item required to progress. In addition, a new type 
of key will be required to open certain doors within the level.
The Caves
The Caves are a network of interconnected tunnels that exist below 
Eagle’s Crossing. It has been many years since anyone has found his way 
down there. Who knows what horrors lie in wait?
If the player has cleared out both previous levels in their entirety, the experience gained 
should put his/her character at Level 5. If the player defeats only one Living Statue (or none), 
he/she will be at Level 4. In either case, this is what I will cover during this chapter.
• 
Random roaming encounters: The player can see an enemy 
sprite on the map. However, what enemy will spawn if the player 
engages? It could be one of three different enemy types!
• 
Random chests: We have chests with variable contents already, 
and we’re going to discuss random enemies, so why not discuss 
random chests as well?
• 
Doors and more doors: This level will have doors that require a 
key to open, as well as doors that open when the player pulls the 
correct switch.
• 
Vehicles: Or, rather, vehicle, in the singular. To get to the Western 
Pixies’ Forest (Level 4), the player will require a way to cross the 
small lake that separates the rest of the level from the way down.

What Does the Town Greeter Have to Say?
The flavor text below is what you should add to the town greeter for this particular 
dungeon level.
The townsfolk are in awe. Caves under their town—who would have 
thought? Now, if you got there through the catacombs, you do have to 
wonder, who, or what, tunneled through the area?
Foreshadowing is the spice of life, don’t you agree? The what, incidentally, is our 
game’s first boss. But more on that later.
Level Overview
As is usual, let’s start by creating the map. Make a 64×47 sized map with the Dungeon tileset, 
the Dungeon2 BGM (change the Pitch from its default of 100% to 70%), and a Dirt1 and 
DirtCave battleback. Then, see Figure 6-1 for a screenshot of the level in completed form.
Figure 6-1.  The Caves of our game’s dungeon
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ■ The Caves
105
■
■Note  The tiles used to create the map are Wall A (Dirt Cave), Ground A (Dirt Cave),  
Water A, and Dark Ground A (Grass Maze). 
The player arrives at the Caves via the rope hanging in the lower-right corner of the 
area. There are a total of 11 enemy encounters and 16 chests on the map. Much like in the 
previous chapter, let’s start this one off by creating the transfer events for the previous level.
Creating Transfer Events for the Lower Catacombs
Like the Upper Catacombs above them, the Lower Catacombs have a pair of staircases 
(or, rather, a single staircase and a hole). Before creating the transfer events, you should 
take a moment and make sure that the hole is passable. By default, the hole tile that I used 
(located in tab A of the Dungeon tileset) does not have passability. How can we change 
the passability of an object? Roughly in the same way we can edit its Terrain Tags (which I 
will cover in the next chapter, in fact).
• 
Open the Database and go to the Tilesets tab.
• 
From there, left-click the Dungeon tileset.
• 
Next, find the hole used in the dungeon level. The hole of interest 
is the seventh tile of the third row of tab A.
• 
If, for some reason, it isn’t set to that option already, click the 
Passage button on the right-hand part of the menu.
• 
You will notice that the hole has an X. An X symbolizes 
impassibility. Click that tile once and note how it changes to an O. 
Tiles that have an O are passable.
Now that our player can actually walk on top of the hole, here’s the relevant Parallel 
transfer event you’ll need for the Lower Catacombs.
Trigger: Parallel
Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
If: X = 55
  If: Y = 42

Now we can start this chapter in earnest. The first topic of discussion will be the 
enemies the player can fight in the Caves.
The Enemies of the Caves 
In Level 1, we had fixed enemy encounters. In Level 2, we had fixed enemy encounters 
of variable sizes, dependent on the value of a random variable. Now, as the player enters 
Level 3, he/she will find him-/herself staring at shapeless monsters that could be one of 
three distinct enemy types. See Table 6-1 for a table of the monsters that the player will 
fight in the Caves. (Minotaur is the boss monster and should prove a hefty challenge to 
any of the main characters.)

The experience and gold rewards may seem rather high, but it is a common dungeon 
crawler convention to scale in this way. After all, you want to keep your players pushing 
ever deeper into the dungeon, not grinding weaker enemies to get some extra levels 
and equipment. As a boss, Minotaur has a total of four skills he can use. Also, he will be 
vulnerable to Fire and immune to Lightning. I will cover the effects of his item drop later 
in the chapter. See Table 6-3 for a breakdown of the new skills created for this chapter.

■Note   You can use the Element Rate Trait (which is one of the Traits in the list that 
comes up when you right-click the Traits section of Database tabs that have one and select 
Edit) to set weaknesses and immunities for enemies (and equipment). Minotaur should have 
Element Rates of Fire * 200% and Lightning * 0%, meaning that he takes double damage 
from fire-based attacks and no damage from lightning. 
Last, but definitely not least, check Figure 6-2 to see a screenshot of Minotaur’s

Rend is Minotaur’s normal attack, and the only skill with a condition of Always. If 
the activation conditions for his other abilities are not valid during a certain turn, you can 
expect to see him use Rend. On every even turn that’s not a multiple of four (2, 6, 10, etc.), 
Minotaur will use either Bolt or Smog Breath (at a 50% chance of using either ability). 
On every fourth turn, Minotaur will boast, causing the boss to skip that turn. I will cover 
Minotaur’s special encounter later in the chapter.
Random Roaming Enemies
For now, let’s cover the regular enemy encounters that will be placed around the area. 
Because we want to have three possible enemy encounters within a single event, we 
should use a sprite with an undefined shape, similar to how some role-playing games 
(RPGs) have handled roaming encounters (world map encounters in Tales of Symphonia 
come to mind). See Figure 6-3 for the sprite I’ll use for these encounters.

■
■Note   You can find the sprite I’m using within the Monster graphic set.
As for the event itself, what if I told you that you can tweak the encounter event used 
for the Bats and Zombies of Level 2 to make this one? Perhaps you already suspected as 
much. After all, the only difference between the two events is their intent. The Level 2  
events were coded to make a troop of either one or two appear. We want the Level 3 
events to randomly select one of three size-one troops. The following is how the event 
should look (and I fully encourage you to draw parallels between this event and the one 
in the previous chapter):


■
■Note  I even use the same variable (d3) as before! As long as you don’t need the variable’s 
information for some other important purpose, it doesn’t really matter what the variable is named.
Take a little time now to create the enemies and their associated troops (we’re 
looking at one troop for each enemy, including the boss, and each troop should have a 
single enemy). As I did not change the name of any of the enemies, you can find their 
battle sprites just by looking for the appropriately named battler graphics. When the 
player bumps into one of these enemy encounters, the game picks a random number 
between one and six and saves the result to the d3 variable. If the result is one or two, the 
player is attacked by a Spider. If the result is three to five, the player must do battle with an 
Imp. If the result happens to be six, the player fights a Snake. Now, you may be wondering 
what will happen if you escape from battle and then re-engage the same encounter. In the 
event’s current state, it’ll pick another random number, and you may find yourself fighting 
a different enemy. If that bothers you, there’s a way to make the initial roll permanent for 
a specific event. What you’ll want to do is the following:
• 
When the player and event meet for the first time, use the random 
variable to get a number, as usual.
• 
Flip a self-switch dependent on the number result.
• 
The enemy encounter is determined by the self-switch that has 
been flipped.
In essence, it should look something like the following:

That will give those events a sense of permanence, should you desire it. Copy-paste 
the event to its relative locations, as shown in Figure 6-1, and let’s move on.
Doors!
In the Caves, there are five doors divided into two different types. Two of the doors 
require keys, while the other three open via the use of switches scattered around the level. 
We have already tackled doors of the former type in Chapter 3 (the Upper Catacombs), 
but the event I will be using this time is slightly different.
Doors That Require Keys
First, here’s page 2 of the door event we used back in Chapter 3. We’ll be using it as a point 
of reference for our new door events.

Our new door events will be two pages long and work somewhat differently than the 
preceding.
• 
The keys used for these doors are single-use. That is, they break 
after they open the door.
• 
The door will remain open permanently, in contrast with the 
catacombs door that locks itself when the player leaves the level.
• 
We will handle the door’s logic in the same page on which we 
place the door description (our other door event divided those 
between two pages).

See Figure 6-4 for a screenshot of the location of the two doors (as well as one of the 
enemy encounters).

As you can see in Figure 6-4, I use the same door graphic for these two doors as the

■Note  If you don’t use Direction Fix for this event, you will see the graphic for the door 
change before your very eyes.
When the player interacts with the stone door, we have the game tell him/her what 
he/she is looking at. Then, if the player has a Stone Key in his/her inventory, it will provide 
the option of opening the door. If the player does not have the key, the door will open for 
the cost of a key. Once the door is open, we flip self-switch A, which causes page 2  
to trigger, removing the stone door graphic for the duration of the game. This level will 
have a pair of Stone Keys that will be used for precisely this purpose.
■
■Note   I’ll cover the Stone Keys later on, when I discuss the treasure chests and their 
contents. Table 6-4 will contain a list of items to add to the game’s Database, Stone Keys 
included.

Doors That Open with Switches
At the event level, making a door that opens with a switch is essentially the same as 
making a door that requires a key. The only real difference lies in how we structure our 
sequence of events. Rather than have a single door that requires an item, we have a door 
that requires a switch to be set, and we have the lever that has to be pulled (and sets the 
appropriate switch when pulled). Figure 6-5 shows the map of the Caves with the doors 
and switches marked accordingly.
Figure 6-5.  The Cave map, with added annotations
When the player pulls the red switch, the red door opens. Likewise, when the green 
switch is pulled, the green door opens. When both switches have been pulled, the gray 
door will open as well. I will cover the process of eventing the red door and red switch and 
leave the green-colored events as an exercise for you. (The finished article can be found

■Note   I toggle Direction Fix in page 2, to prevent the lever graphic from temporarily 
glitching out when the player interacts with it. It is not necessary to do this for page 1. In 
fact, if you set Direction Fix to on in the first page of the switch event, it won’t animate at all 
(just suddenly be set to the end position when the page is switched).
You can create the green switch event in the same way (the graphics used for the 
green switch are six squares to the right of the red lever graphics). All you would have 
to do is replace the graphics and the switch that is flipped on (GreenSwitch instead of 
RedSwitch). The green switch event is located at 42,20. Now, let’s tackle the red door event.

There’s really not much to it. If the player finds the door in a raised position (in 
other words, before pulling the red lever), he/she will receive a short message when he/
she interacts with it. Otherwise, the door will not be there at all, and the player can pass 
through. The red door is located at 41,14. The graphic used for the green door is one tile 
left from the red door graphic (and is actually a gray door with green moss, but it'll do for 
our purposes). The green door is located at 26,8.
I decided to use a three-page event for the gray door, in the interest of being efficient. 
You want the player to know whether a door has been unlocked by their actions, and the 
best way to do so is to have a different message display when the player pulls the second 
switch. I’m going to use an Autorun event for this purpose, but instead of dedicating 
an event slot to it, I’ll just make it so that the second page of the gray door event has an 
Autorun trigger. The gray door is located at 51,28. Without further ado, here’s the gray 
door event code:

The first page is identical to that of the red and green doors. Where it gets interesting 
is when both the red and green switches have been flipped. Page 2 triggers automatically 
at that point, telling the player that another door has opened in the distance and flipping 
the self-switch that makes the gray door event move on to page 3, which is the same blank 
page that the other two doors have. With that set up, it’s time to talk about this level’s loot!
The Cave’s Treasure
The Caves are home to a whopping 15 chests, the most important of which are the two 
chests containing Iron Keys and the single metallic chest that contains an item that will 
be essential for the player’s continued progression. Following is the list of treasure that 
should be divided within the 14 regular chests of the dungeon level. The contents of the 
first three chests are determined by the player character (Palnor/Gust/Feylia). The contents 
of the next three chests are randomly determined. The last group of items is for nonspecific 
chests that will have the same rewards for all characters.
• 
Power Amulet/Eagle Amulet/Defense Amulet
• 
Iron Chestplate/Iron Helm/400 Gold
• 
Iron Greatsword/500 Gold/Scroll of Immolate
•

www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ■ The Caves
120
You’re free to put the treasure where you like in the level. The only hints, if you will, 
that I will offer concerning what should go where are the following:
• 
The metallic chest beyond the gray door will contain a special 
item called the Magic Oar. It uses a common event that will be 
discussed in a bit.
• 
At least one of the two Stone Keys should be located before the 
first stone door. There are a total of five chests that meet this 
condition. After all, what good is a key if it’s locked behind the 
door it’s meant to open?
• 
The greater rewards (such as the amulets) should be located in the  
harder-to-reach spots. I recommend placing most of them in the 
areas behind the red and green doors.
• 
The three bullets in the treasure list with percentage-based drops 
will be covered in the next section, so feel free to fill those after 
reading that far.
With all of that out of the way, it’s time to add the new items to our game. See 
Table 6-4 for the list of items that should be added to our game’s Database, along with 
where in the Database they go.

■
■Note   From here on, you should add new items to the end of their respective Database 
sections. So, the Amulets would be placed after the Mythril Arrow, while the two new Key 
Items would be placed after the Catacomb Key. Give the accessories an armor type of Light 
Armor so that all of the characters can use them.  
While little more than a semantic difference, you can differentiate regular items from 
important ones via the Item Type drop-down for any given item. Key Items are meant to be 
important items in your game.
Random Treasure
So, we have three chests in the previous section that have random probabilities for each 
item drop. We can handle this in the same way that we handled our enemy encounters. 
This time, we’ll have d3 roll a random number from one to ten. I’ll create the random 
treasure chest for the first of the three chests. You should be able to adapt the following 
event for the other two random chests.
Control Variables: #0004 d3 = Random  1...10

Control Self Switch: A = ON

I am able to streamline the preceding event owing to the fact that the chest opening 
animation and self-switch toggle occur no matter what item the player receives. So, 
instead of placing the Set Movement Route and Control Self Switch event commands in 
triplicate, I can just have the chest open and then give the player the appropriate item, 
based on the random variable roll.
■
■Note   Because I gave the percentage values in multiples of 10, we can use a variable 
that can roll from 1 to 10. Alternately, you could use a variable that goes up to 100 and 
then add a zero to each of the conditional branches. I tend to err toward the most intuitive 
solution whenever possible, but there are multiple ways to roll random numbers that will 
give the same result.
The Magic Oar
Past the gray door, the player will eventually find a special chest. It has the same graphic 
as the tomb chests in Level 2 and contains a very useful item. When used from the 
inventory, it will spawn a canoe in front of the character, but only if he/she is facing 
shallow water. Otherwise, the canoe will not appear, and an error message will be 
displayed. Before we populate the relevant chest, let’s create the common event that will 
trigger when the item is used. This common event will require the following:
• 
Three variables. We already have two to store the player’s x and y 
coordinates. We need a third to store the player’s current map ID.
• 
The use of the Get Location Info and Set Vehicle Location event 
commands
• 
Setting the Terrain Tag of the Water tile to 1
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ■ The Caves
123
All things considered, the common event is actually very easy to create. In fact, the 
only thing that could give pause is determining whether the tile in front of the player is 
shallow water, hence the reason for using Terrain Tags. In the last chapter, I promised to 
cover how to set Terrain Tags. Well, here you go.
• 
Make your way to the Tilesets tab of the Database.
• 
Find the Dungeon tileset, then click the Terrain Tag button on the 
right-hand side of the menu (it happens to be the last button in 
the list, so it should be easy to find).
• 
Then, find the shallow water tile and click it once. This will 
change its Terrain Tag from 0 to 1. See Figure 6-6 for a visual 
representation of the use of Terrain Tags in this exercise. 
With that done, we can begin work on our common event in earnest. We’ll call it 
CallCanoe.

As noted before, this event is pretty easy to create. This is the event breakdown:
• 
We save the player’s x and y coordinates and their current map ID 
to appropriate variables.
• 
Then, we alter the value of x or y, depending on the direction 
the player is facing. So, for example, if he/she is facing left, we 
reduce the value of x by 1. We do this because we want to check 
the square located in front of the character, and not the square it 
is actually on.
• 
After determining the x and y location of the square in front of the 
player character, we use Get Location Info to check the square’s 
Terrain Tag.
• 
If the Terrain Tag is equal to 1, a text message is displayed, and the 
canoe is placed in front of the player. Otherwise, an error message 
of “You can only place the canoe in shallow water!” is returned. 
■
■Note  RMMV comes with three distinct vehicles. The Boat (which looks like a canoe) is 
the vehicle we are using and can only move on shallow water, hence my precautions. The 
Ship has sails and can move on any type of water, while the Airship looks like a blimp and 
can fly over any terrain but can only land on solid ground.
There you have it—a pretty cool (and easy) way for the player to have his/her own 
personal canoe.
■
■Note   Don’t forget to use the Common Event Effect to add the new event to your Magic 
Oar item! As a reminder, you can add Effects to Items by right-clicking the Effects section 
and then left-clicking Edit. Common Event is on the Others tab of the Effect dialog menu.
The Magic Oar Chest Event
While we have worked through several different types of chests already, this particular 
event bears explanation, as we will handle it in an unconventional way. Before that, we 
want to make it so that while he exists, Minotaur blocks the player from escaping the 
room via Return. To do this, we can add the following snippet of code to our two Return 
common events.
If: Party has Magic Oar
  If: MinotaurDefeated is OFF
    Text: None, Window, Bottom
    :     : A malevolent presence prevents you from leaving the

    :     : room!
    Jump to Label: Lock
    
  :  End
  
:  End
■
■Note   You’ll have to add a Label named Lock to the very end of the common event 
page. Otherwise, the player will be able to use Return, despite the message.
This makes it so that when the player opens the Magic Oar chest, he/she will be 
unable to escape the room unless Minotaur is defeated. Now, let’s create the chest event 
itself.
Play SE: Chest1 (90, 100, 0)
Set Movement Route: This event (Wait)
:                  : ◊Direction Fix OFF

Text: None, Window, Bottom
:    : A vicious roar echoes through the area!
Fadein Screen
Text: None, Window, Bottom
:     : Minotaur has appeared! Defeat him to escape the room!
In the preceding event, we cheat a little to make Minotaur’s appearance more fluid. 
Instead of just having him suddenly pop into existence when the player grabs the Oar, 
we have the screen fade out before the player gets the item. Then, we go through the text 
as normal and award the player (and his/her companion) 100 EXP. Afterward, we play a 
sound effect of a monster roaring and display an appropriate text message. The screen 
fades in, and the player discovers that Minotaur has appeared.

■
■Note   It is possible that the player may not be strong enough to defeat Minotaur (or lack 
the potions needed to survive). If the player saves the game at this time, it may be rendered 
unwinnable. To counteract this, you can use the Change Save Access event command. 
Disable access to the Save menu when the player opens the Magic Oar chest and Enable it 
immediately before you process the Minotaur fight.
Minotaur, the Half Man, Half Bull—Our First Boss
In Greek mythology, Minotaur lives within a labyrinth meant to confuse would-be 
adventurers. Naturally, Minotaur himself has no such problems navigating his labyrinth. 
Pretty cool, huh? Minotaur will appear in front of the gray door, once the player opens 
the chest containing the Magic Oar, and patiently await the player’s presence. Here are 
the event pages for Minotaur, our game’s first boss. You can see a screenshot of the event 
graphic used to represent Minotaur in Figure 6-7, immediately after the following  
event code

So, when do we switch MinotaurDefeated to on? During the battle, of course! The 
actual timing of the toggle is irrelevant, given the fact that the player cannot escape the 
battle. In any case, make your way to the Troops tab and find (or create, if you haven’t yet) 
your Minotaur troop. Once you do, decide at what point in the battle you want the switch 
to be flipped. I’ll flip it as soon as the battle starts. Here’s how to add events to a Troop.
• 
Find the troop you wish to add event commands to.
• 
Look at the lower half of the dialog menu and press New Event 
Page (or, alternatively, edit the single page that is available by 
default).
• 
Set a condition for the event to trigger, based on what you want it 
to do. In this case, because I want the event to trigger at the start 
of the fight, I set the condition to Turn 0 by toggling the relevant 
check box in the menu that appears when you click the “...” 
button on the Condition bar. Turn conditions default to 0, so no 
additional input is required.
• 
Last, but not least, I set the Span to Battle so that the event only 
triggers once. If you set the Span to Turn, it will trigger once per 
turn, and if you set the Span to Moment, it will keep triggering 
until the condition is not met anymore (which will cause the 
game to hang, if the condition is always met).
With the preceding setup, all you need now is the actual event code, so here it is:
Condition: Turn  0
Span: Battle
Control Switches: #0013 MinotaurDefeated = ON
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ■ The Caves
129
And that’s all you need (yes, seriously)! When players attack and defeat Minotaur, 
they will once again be able to use Return and make their way around the rest of the level. 
More important, they will be able to use the Magic Oar to create a canoe they can board to 
reach the staircase leading down to the Pixies’ Forest. That concludes this chapter.
■
■Note  By using the Change BGM event command, you can change the music that plays 
during battle. If you want to give bosses special music, that would be the command to use. 
Make sure you switch back to your game’s default battle music after the fight is over. If you 
are unclear as to how to do this, I’ll cover the technicalities in Chapter 8.
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we created the Caves, our dungeon crawler’s third 
level. We added monster encounters that trigger battles with random enemies, a lake that 
requires a canoe to cross, and our first boss encounter. In the next chapter, we will work 
on the western half of the Pixies’ Forest, our dungeon’s fourth level.

Chapter 7
The Pixies’ Forest (West)
In this chapter, we will be working on our dungeon’s fourth level, the western half of the 
Pixies’ Forest. This next area will be so large that I will be splitting it into two sections, 
the western half and the eastern half. As such, I’ll be covering this part of the game 
throughout the next two chapters. In this chapter, I’ll be covering the western half. The 
canoe that the player acquired in the Caves is required to traverse this level as well, as a 
large part of it is flooded.
The Pixies’ Forest (West)
The player character should currently be at Level 7, inching ever closer to Level 8. This, of 
course, means that the enemies have to be stronger, and the loot has to be better. Here are 
the things to cover in this chapter.
• 
Ambush encounters: The player is quietly passing through a 
particular area and is attacked by enemies!
• 
A new town: About the halfway point of the level, the player will 
find a new town, inhabited by Pixies.
• 
Accessory shop: So, the player has found two accessories already. 
However, there’s no shop for accessories in Eagle’s Crossing. We’ll 
add one in the Pixies’ town.
• 
Teleporter: We will connect the Pixies’ town with Eagle’s Crossing 
via a teleporter.
What Does the Town Greeter Have to Say?
An underground forest? You have got to be kidding me. Then again, if 
you found a magical oar that summons a canoe, I suppose I should stop 
being so incredulous. Good job on defeating that monster too, by the 
way. Some of the sketchier elements of our town are trying to take what 
they can from its corpse, but that’s none of my concern.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (West)
132
How does the town greeter know so much? Does the player’s character sneak off to 
talk to him while the player is not playing the game? It’s a mystery to everyone.
Level Overview
Make a 59×47 sized map with the Dungeon tileset, the Field1 BGM (70% Pitch), and a 
GrassMaze and GrassMaze battleback. Then, see Figure 7-1 for a screenshot of the level in 
completed form.
Figure 7-1.  The western half of the Pixies’ Forest 
■
■Note  The tiles used to create the map are Wall E(Grass Maze), Ground B (Grass Maze), 
Water A, Deep Water, and Dark Ground B(Grass Maze). 
The western half of the Pixies’ Forest holds eight visible enemy encounters and four 
ambushes, as well as seven chests. The player’s canoe is unable to traverse through deep 
water, so his/her route through the area will be somewhat constrained.

Creating Transfer Events for the Caves
By now, you should have a good idea of how to create Parallel transfer events. In fact, 
perhaps you’ve already created the relevant event for the Caves. In any case, because this 
has already become something of a habit, I might as well keep writing these down. Recall 
that the two exits to the Caves are located at 16,017 and 61,41.

The Enemies of the Pixies’ Forest (West)
We have treaded a lot of ground in terms of different types of enemy encounters. For this 
dungeon level, we will add four ambush encounters that appear when the player crosses 
certain areas of the water. I’ll cover those encounters in a later section. For now, see 
Table 7-1 for a list of enemy encounters in the Pixies’ Forest (West).

■Note   The battler graphic for the Man-Eating Plant is called Plant in RMMV. As there 
is no appropriate event graphic for the Plant enemy in this version of RPG Maker, I instead 
decided to use the green vines graphic in Tileset B to represent them on the map. They’re 
the graphic directly to the right of the upper-left corner of the tileset page. 
The Man-Eating Plant takes double damage from Slash-based attacks and half-
damage from Crush-based attacks but is immune to the Sleep State. You can use the State 
Rate Trait to set an enemy’s resistance to a particular State. Setting the rate to 0% grants 
them immunity. The Ghost enemy is immune to Poison and Paralysis. See Table 7-3 for a 
breakdown of the new skill created for this chapter.

■
■Note  The preceding can be accomplished with State Resist, but you should never give 
an enemy a State Resist to Death. While our game will not have such an effect, if you wish 
to include an instant death effect to which enemies are immune, give the enemies a State 
Rate of 0% to Death instead. 
The only enemy in this dungeon level that has new skills is the Cockatrice. While the 
Cockatrice is known for petrifying its victims, such an effect would be a bit excessive for 
our game. Instead, let’s just give it a paralysis effect. The player should have a companion 
by this point, and this particular monster is a case study in why. The player will have 
a hard time doing anything if he/she gets paralyzed repeatedly and has no help. Now, 
let’s cover the concept of enemy ambushes and how we create them in RPG Maker MV 
(RMMV).
Ambush Encounters
In role-playing games (RPGs), the most common types of encounters are usually random 
(enemies that attack the player after a certain average number of steps) or static. During 
the course of creating our dungeon crawler, we have been incorporating various types of 
visible static encounters. Now, I’m going to create some encounters that trigger when the 
player passes through a certain area. How do we accomplish this? The easiest way is via 
Terrain Tags or regions. Given the fact that I’m going to place the encounters in the water, 
and we are already using Terrain Tags for the canoe common event logic, I will be using 
regions instead. Figure 7-2 is a screenshot of the dungeon level in Region Mode, which 
shows the four ambush locations.

■Note  Adding regions to a map is as easy as clicking on the R tab of the current tileset 
while in Map Editing Mode. This serves the function that Region Editing Mode used to 
serve in earlier versions of the software. Here’s a list of exactly where you have to draw 
each individual region on the map. (You can refer to the appropriate map in the download 
package to verify these exact locations.) 
• 
Region 1: (13,27), (13,28), and (13,29)

encounters. Here is the full event:

The general idea of this event is the following: the first time the player sails into an 
ambush point, he/she will be forced to fight one (first two ambushes) or two (second two 
ambushes) enemies. The player cannot escape the battles, but these do not re-spawn in 
the way that most other enemy encounter events do.
■
■Note  I created four ambushes for the sake of efficiency, as each event has four self-
switches it can use. If you want more ambushes, you have to use extra switches.
As is proper, the ambushes get harder and harder as the player progresses through 
the area.
Unlocking the Pixies’ Vale
The player has gotten through three levels of the game’s dungeon and is continually 
approaching the game’s final objective. However, while using Return Crystals (or the 
Return spell) provides a way to instantly return to town when needed, it would still be 
nice to have an actual teleport spot. The perfect place to put it is within another town. 
That way, we can connect both towns. The Pixies’ town is hidden from mortal sight 
behind some otherwise inconspicuous vines (at 23,30) some ways to the south of the 
staircase leading back to the previous level. However, attempts to reach the vines that 
lead into the town will fail, as a barrier of vines to the south will stop the player from 
getting that far. The way forward lies with a lone Pixie, exiled to a small island to the west 
of her home. See Figure 7-3 for a screenshot of the area surrounding the entrance to the 
Pixies’ Vale.

Chapter 7 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (West)
139
The player will have to speak to the Pixie on the island to receive her help. If the 
player interacts with the vines before talking to the Pixie, she will call them to her side. In 
either case, she will “join” (in a guest capacity, not as an actual party member) the player 
and allow him/her to progress. See Figure 7-4 for the Pixie’s graphic, then keep on reading 
to see her event code.

With the help of a mystical fairy creature, the player is within a few paces of the 
entrance to the Pixie’s Vale. That, of course, means that we have to create the town as well. 
The Pixies’ Vale, much like Eagle’s Crossing, is actually a pair of maps. The first map is the 
town exterior; the second map is the town interior. Unlike Eagle’s Crossing, the interiors 
of each building are directly connected to one another. Anyway, when the player interacts 
with the wall vines that hide the entrance to the Pixies’ Vale, the Pixie will brush her hand 
against the vines, and the player will be transferred appropriately. Here’s the event in 
question, which is a single page in length:

■Note   You can use the lower half of the Wall Vine graphic for the event and then draw 
only the top half, using Map Mode, instead of drawing both halves of the graphic and having 
a blank event graphic. Either method is fine.
The obvious question now would be, what does the Pixies’ Vale look like? It’s a 25×25 
map that uses the Outside tileset and (among other tiles) the Forest tile for its buildings. 
Take a look at Figure 7-6.

You may have already noticed a graphic in the center of the town that looks identical 
to the Return portal in Eagle’s Crossing. We’ll touch upon that soon.
The Queen of the Pixies
The player now finds him-/herself within a natural village, with buildings made out of the 
very trees of a forest and interiors that wind into the belly of the earth. The player seeks 
the queen of the Pixies. Luckily, she’s as close as entering any one of the three accessible 
natural buildings (the southeastern building cannot be reached from the outside). Here is 
the Parallel  transfer event I use for the various exits in the Pixies’ Vale.

As usual, place that event somewhere the player cannot normally reach, just to be 
safe. Then, see Figure 7-7 for a picture of the interior map for the Pixies’ Vale. The interior 
map uses the Dungeon tileset.
Figure 7-7.  The interior of the Pixies’ Vale
■
■Note   Given that finding the Vale advances the main story, I would give the player some 
story experience here. I personally give the player 500 EXP via an Autorun event that triggers 
the first time the player enters the Pixies’ Vale. This helps to compensate a bit for the 
otherwise lackluster experience gains that this level offers. 
Once inside, the player will see four pixies surrounding a blue and purple-haired 
character in the middle. That is Titania, the Queen of the Pixies. (Neat trivia fact: It was 
William Shakespeare who, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, originally bestowed a name 
on the queen of the fairies. In popular folklore, she had no actual name until then.) Each 
of the four pixies is a two-page event. The first page is identical for all four of the pixies. 
The code is as follows.

For the second page, each of the Pixies will be different. I will provide a bullet list 
of what has to be spread among the Pixies, with the only caveat being that the very first 
bullet must be the southeastern Pixie’s second page, for reasons that will soon become 
apparent. First, here are the settings that should be identical for the four second pages:
Condition: 0015 QueenTalk
Priority: Same as characters
Trigger: Action Button
With that out of the way, here’s the bullet list.
• 
If you take the stairs next to me, you’ll find our town’s shopkeeper. 
She deals in rare amulets and accessories that you might find use 
for.
• 
We used to live above ground in times long past. However, we fled 
into secrecy when humans started to expand their society.
• 
We have lived within this vale for centuries. Once, we were more. 
Someday, we will be gone.
• 
The remaining Pixie should function as an inn, allowing the 
player to rest for free.
The QueenTalk switch will be flipped on when the player speaks with Titania. See 
Figure 7-8 for the graphic used for our Pixie queen.
Figure 7-8.  The graphic used for our Queen of the Pixies. You can find this one in the 
Nature graphic set, much like the other we used for the Pixies.
Titania’s event will have three pages. The first page is, for lack of a better term, an info 
dump. The player receives a lot of information concerning the happenings in the area and 
receives his/her next objective: to destroy a monster called Lamia. Without further ado, 
see the following for page 1 of Titania’s event.

Titania reveals the name of the Pixie accompanying the player character and then 
drops a hint about secrets hidden within vines deeper in the forest. I highlight this within 
the text via the use of one of RMMV’s various text modifiers. Writing \C[n] (where n is a 
number; in the preceding event code, 2 is orange and 0 is white) changes the color of the 
text that follows the modifier. For the player, learning about the vines and the secrets they 
hold will be particularly important in the next chapter, when he/she visits the eastern 
half of the Pixies’ Forest. Once the queen has finished speaking, the QueenTalk switch is 
flipped, and the portal in the town exterior is activated. Talking to the queen again after 
this sequence but before defeating Lamia reveals the second page of her event.

In a nutshell, the second page of Titania’s event is a not-so-subtle nudge to the player 
to continue the game, rather than stick around. I will discuss the last page of this event in 
the next chapter. For now, there are two more events within the Pixies’ Vale.
The Accessory Shop
You’ll recall that, in the exterior part of the Pixies’ Vale, the southeastern building is 
inaccessible. The player must make his/her way into the interior and then take the 
southeastern exit back to the exterior. If the player has spoken with Titania, he/she will 
find a solitary Pixie floating directly below the nearby tree. She is this game’s accessory 
shop. The event in question is a single page in size and requires that QueenTalk be 
on, using the same graphic as we used for the other Pixies so far. The player can talk 
with the Pixie to receive a warm welcome and shop for accessories. As we have made 
several shops already, I’ll gloss over the event and, instead, list some new accessories in 
Table 7-4 that should be included in the shop’s lineup. You should be able to create all 
of these items, using the skills you’ve learned so far in this book.

Chapter 7 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (West)

Including the four accessories we created in the previous chapter, our game now has 
a total of eleven accessories for the player to acquire.
The Portal to Eagle’s Crossing
The portal leading back to Eagle’s Crossing opens once QueenTalk is on, much like the 
Accessory Shop. Once it is open, the player can stand on it and press the Action button 
to receive a prompt asking him/her if he/she wishes to travel to Eagle’s Crossing. If the 
player says yes, he/she will appear in front of the vines behind the Equipment Shop in 
Eagle’s Crossing. The portal event is one page long and consists of the following code:

Of course, a portal isn’t much good if it’s only one-way, so let’s add an event to that 
wall vine behind Palnor, so that the player can get back to Pixies’ Vale.

■Note  I use that specific conditional on the event, as it would not make much sense to 
allow the player to skip through half of the game by finding the portal early. That is without 
even mentioning the logical flaw that would surface, given that Titania does not open the 
portal until the player talks to her.
With all of that said, we are done with the Pixies’ Vale.

The Path to Pixies’ Forest (East)
To close out this chapter, I’m going to display two more locations that require transfer 
events. The first one is located directly to the east of the vines that lead into the Pixies’ 
Vale. Interacting with those vines will take the player to a similar set not more than a few 
squares further east, if he/she has already talked to Titania. Otherwise, the vines will do 
nothing. See Figure 7-11 for a view of the area I am referring to.

■Note   This is one case where the event priority is important. If the priority of these 
particular transfer events is not Same as characters, the player will not be able to interact 
with them.
The other location is the place where we should connect this level to the fifth 
dungeon level (which we’ll officially do in the next chapter). This particular transition is 
notable in that it is the only one in the entire game that involves going from one half of a 
dungeon level to the other half. See Figure 7-12.
Figure 7-12.  The area surrounding the entrance to Pixies’ Forest (East)
Once the player reaches the gap in the grass wall on the far right side of the area,  
he/she will pass into the eastern half of the level. That, however, is the subject of the next 
chapter.

Summary
During the course of this chapter, we created the western half of the Pixies’ Forest, our 
dungeon crawler’s fourth level. We added monster encounters that are triggered when 
the player passes through a specific area, a secret town inhabited by Pixies, and a quest 
that requires the player to travel to the next level to complete. In the next chapter, we will 
work on the eastern half of the Pixies’ Forest, our dungeon’s penultimate level.

Chapter 8
The Pixies’ Forest (East)
In this chapter, we will be working on our dungeon’s fifth level, the eastern half of the 
Pixies’ Forest. The player is close to finishing the game and will fight his/her last boss at 
the end of this particular area (as the Ancient Temple won’t have an actual boss). The 
canoe that the player received in the Caves will be upgraded here, so that the player can 
progress, given that most of the level is made up of deep water.
The Pixies’ Forest (East)
With the experience provided by the game so far, the player character should currently 
be at Level 11 (within about 200 experience points from reaching Level 12). Here are the 
things I’ll cover in this chapter:
• 
Hidden dwellings: The player was advised, by his/her Pixie 
companion, of the way to find hidden places within the forest. 
This level will have several of those. Some will advance the 
player’s progress, while others will lead to locations hiding a 
single Pixie that will impart some information.
• 
An upgradable item: As already noted in the chapter’s 
introduction, the player’s canoe is ill equipped for this level, 
given the amount of deep water that it contains. We will create a 
nonplayer character (NPC) that swaps the player’s Magic Oar for 
a Magic Sail.
• 
The final boss: Lamia stands atop the ruins of the Ancient Temple 
and must be defeated, so that Titania will be able to send the 
player to the game’s final level.
What Does the Town Greeter Have to Say?
The forest goes deeper? I’m not even sure what to say anymore. Could the 
ancient artifact be somewhere inside that forest?
The answer to that is both yes and no, not that the town greeter would care much 
about the difference.

Level Overview
Much like in the previous chapter, you’ll want to make a 59×47 sized map with the 
Dungeon tileset, the Field1 BGM at 70% Pitch, and a GrassMaze and GrassMaze 
battleback. Afterward, see Figure 8-1 for a screenshot of the level in completed form.
Figure 8-1.  The eastern half of the Pixies’ Forest 
■
■Note  The tiles used to create the map are the same as in Chapter 7: Wall E (Grass 
Maze), Ground B (Grass Maze), Water A, Deep Water, and Dark Ground B (Grass Maze). 
The eastern half of the Pixies’ Forest contains eight visible enemy encounters and 
eleven chests. The player’s boat cannot sail through deep water, so his/her first order of 
business will be to find the Magic Sail that will upgrade his/her Magic Oar. As is standard 
by now, let’s start the chapter by talking about transfer events.

Chapter 8 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (East)

Creating Transfer Events for the Pixies’ Forest
You may be surprised to know that this will be the last time that I include such a section in 
a chapter. We must add the Parallel transfer event to cover both exits of the western part 
of the forest and then add another one in the eastern part for the way back to the previous 
level. First, let’s create the event for the previous level. The exits are at 20,18, and the three 
squares at 58X with y coordinates of 5, 6, and 7, respectively.
Trigger: Parallel
Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
If: X = 58
  If: Self Switch A is OFF
    Control Variables: #0001 DeepestDungeonFloor = 5
    Control Self Switch: A = ON
    Transfer Player: Level 5 (1,6) (Direction: Right)
  : Else
    Transfer Player: Level 5 (1,6) (Direction: Right)
    
  : End
  
: End
If: X = 20
  If: Y = 18
    Transfer Player: Level 3 (16,18) (Direction: Down)
    
  : End
  
: End

Now, switch over to our current dungeon level to make the transfer event that leads 
back to the previous level. The exit is located at 0X.
Trigger: Parallel
Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
If: X = 0
  Transfer Player: Level 4 (57,6) (Direction: Left)
  
: End

We need only one more transfer event in this game, and it will be covered at the end 
of this chapter. You’re almost done with the game. Keep it up!

The Enemies of the Pixies’ Forest (East)
The penultimate level of the game will have encounters in the form of enemy pairs. So, 
when the player runs into an enemy sprite, he/she will be attacked by two units of that 
enemy (the obvious exception, of course, being the level boss). See Table 8-1 for the list of 
enemies.

Lamia is the game’s final boss and serves as one last roadblock to the player’s gaining 
entry to the Ancient Temple. Orcs and Forest Bats form the normal enemy encounters, 
and they will do their best to stop the player as he/she tries to make his/her way to Lamia. 
Before we move on, I'm going to talk a bit about the Forest Bat. See the next section for 
details.
When Recolors Attack
Recolored enemies are a classic RPG tradition. They originated from the fact that older 
computers and consoles lacked the spare space to have many unique graphics, so instead 
there was a lot of graphical recycling. In the first edition of this book, all of the game’s 
enemies were unique. However, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. MV 
lacks event graphics for many enemies (hence why we represented our Plant enemies 
last chapter with a Beanstalk graphic). Since MV does have a graphic for Bats, we can 
just recolor the Bat battler and give it a new name, stats, and attacks. Recoloring a battler 
within RMMV is rather easy, and you may have even noticed the setting that allows it 
already. For the sake of completeness, create the Orc enemy and fill in its stat block before 
reading below.
• 
Go to the Enemies tab and click on the empty slot immediately 
below the Orc.
• 
Click on the Image section to bring up the Select an Image 
window.
• 
Find the Bat and left-click on it.
• 
You should see a draggable bar immediately above the Ok and 
Cancel buttons named Hue, as well as a number within a box.
• 
Set the Bat's hue to 126 and you're done!

Pretty neat, eh? While there are people who deride recolors as lazy, I've always 
thought them cool to make better versions of previously fought enemies. Besides, 
who's to say that there aren't multiple versions of the same enemy in the game world? 
Unfortunately, you can't recolor the associated event graphic in the same way. However, if 
you're graphically inclined, you could use your favorite painting program to try and make 
an appropriately colored event graphic of the Bat that way. That could be a neat task for a 
day in which you're bored and want something to do.?

As befitting a boss, Lamia has a more complex attack pattern than the standard 
enemies. While most of the skills used for the new enemies were created in earlier 
chapters, there are three new skills to note. Take a look at Table 8-3 for details.

As you can see, all of the new skills involve improving the enemy’s ability to inflict 
physical damage or reduce the player character’s ability to withstand it. As play-testing 
should bear out, Palnor’s high HP and Defense make him nearly impossible to defeat 
by most enemies, unless the player is careless about keeping his/her HP topped off. 
These monsters should do quite a bit to force the player to be more proactive in dungeon 
battles, instead of merely being able to select Attack to win every single fight.
■
■Note  Having an easy character is not necessarily bad in a game that offers choices. The 
player can decide to challenge him-/herself in a subsequent run by playing as Gust or Feylia.
Paired Encounters
There’s not much else to say about the usual enemy encounters themselves, given the fact 
that the eventing doesn’t particularly deviate from what has been discussed up to now. 
Without further ado, look below for the relevant event code for the Orc encounters.

For the Forest Bat encounters, you need only replace the Battle Processing event with

Hidden Dwellings and Portals
When players first make their way to the eastern side of the Pixies’ Forest, they will find 
that they are only able to traverse an extremely limited portion of the area. There are 
several locations of interest that lead to hidden locations or connect to another part of the 
dungeon level. A player can access them by interacting with the middle vine in a group of 
five wall vines. See Figure 8-2 for a screenshot marking each of the various wall vines.
Figure 8-2.  The eastern half of the Pixies’ Forest, with added markings
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (East)
162
As you can see in Figure 8-2, there are two rectangles that denote hidden dwellings 
and two pairs of letters that denote teleporters. The player will want to go through the A 
portal on the left side of the area, which will take him/her to the other side of the level, 
where he/she can call his/her canoe to reach a solitary island not unlike the one where 
his/her Pixie companion was found.
The Magic Sail
The Pixie on that solitary island at 032,013 will turn the player’s Magic Oar into a Magic 
Sail. Here’s the relevant event code for the Pixie.

■Note   The previous event does not check to see if the player actually has the Magic 
Oar in his/her inventory. Keep in mind that it is impossible for the player to reach the Pixie 
without the aid of the Magic Oar. Still, checking to see if the item is in the player’s inventory 
is as easy as using a Conditional Branch.
Note how we remove the Magic Oar from the player’s inventory and add the Magic 
Sail in its place. Additionally, because the player won’t be using the Boat anymore, we use 
a Set Vehicle Location event command (along with a Fadein/Fadeout to hide the actual 
vehicle transfer) to send it off to the character select map (as the player doesn’t set foot in 
there after a character has been chosen). Of course, the Magic Sail is going to be of little 
use to the player unless we associate a common event to it. For this purpose, we can copy 
the Magic Oar common event and rework it to cover for the fact that the ship should be 
used instead of the boat. Take a look at the CallShip common event to be associated with 
the Magic Ship and compare it with the CallCanoe common event we created for the 
Magic Oar back in Chapter 6.

The CallShip event is fairly similar to the CallCanoe event, with the main difference 
that we define the latter half of the event such that the error message is triggered if the 
Terrain Tag is equal to 0 and allows the player to summon the ship on both shallow and 
deep water. Also, you’ll want to set the location of the Ship vehicle rather than the Boat 
vehicle. Last, but perhaps most important, you’ll have to set the Deep Water tile Terrain 
Tag in the Dungeon tileset to 2 (the Deep Water tile is conveniently to the right of the 
Water A tile we set to 1 in Chapter 6).
Hidden Pixies
As noted previously, there are two hidden dwellings within the dungeon level. Both of 
them contain a single Pixie that will give the player some information when spoken to. 
For this particular instance, I decided to use a single 33x14 map to cover both of the 
dwellings. See Figure 8-3. 
Figure 8-3.  The pair of hidden dwellings that the player can find in Pixies’ Forest (East). 
Note the dividing grass wall.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 ■ The Pixies’ Forest (East)
166
■
■Tip  You can use large pieces of dividing terrain to stop players from noticing that the 
map contains areas that are not directly connected. The player can see eight spaces to his/
her left and right and about six spaces north and south (as many as ten if you reach a map 
border that prevents scrolling in one direction). As long as you make the terrain bigger than 
that, the player won’t be able to see the difference.
Neat trick, isn’t it? The dwelling to the left connects to the first wall of vines near the 
exit to Pixies’ Forest (West) located at 22,3. The dwelling to the right connects to the other 
marked wall of vines near Lamia (18,28). So, what will the Pixies say? The left Pixie should 
talk about the player’s Magic Oar and how he/she can upgrade it by finding the Pixie on 
the lone island to the east. Once the player has the Magic Sail, the Pixie should tell the 
player to find the other hidden dwelling. The second Pixie should talk about Lamia and 
offer the player a place to rest before he/she heads off to the boss battle. As for the text 
events themselves, the first Pixie will have a total of four pages, to cover the following:
	
1.	
Talking to the player about the Magic Sail
	
2.	
Urging the player to get the Magic Sail if he/she hasn’t gotten 
it yet
	
3.	
What the Pixie will say once the player has the Magic Sail
	
4.

The Treasure of Pixies’ Forest (East)
This dungeon level has a whopping 11 treasure chests to be opened by the player. As 
usual, they will be divided into the three distinct types of treasure that we have touched 
upon during the course of this book. Here are their contents:
	
1.	
Character-specific treasure (Palnor/Gust/Feylia)
• 
Mythril Sword/Mythril Bow/Mythril Tunic
• 
Mythril Chestplate/Mythril Helm/Scroll of Thunder Storm
	
2.	
Random treasure
• 
Restoration Potion (80%)/Gold Bars (20%)
• 
Return Crystal (90%)/Gold Bars (10%)
	
3.	
Normal treasure
• 
Return Crystal
• 
Anti-Crush
• 
Restoration Potion
• 
Gold Bars
• 
Panacea × 2
• 
Healing Potion × 2
• 
Eye Drops
The game is rapidly approaching its conclusion, so the random chests have a chance 
to give the player Gold Bars. The extra gold, should the player be so lucky, will be useful 
for filling any equipment gaps that may remain at this point of the game. Notably, one 
of the normal chests contains an Anti-Crush, which will halve the damage of Lamia’s 
normal attacks .
Lamia, the Snake Monster—the Second Boss
Lamia will be our game’s second and last boss. As such, this boss event will be rather 
more nuanced. As the player approaches Lamia, he/she will trigger a pair of text events 
noting Lamia’s presence. Each of the two events will have two pages. See Figure 8-4 for a 
screenshot of the location of both events.

As you can see, I decided to give the player’s possible companions a little exposure. 
While the strong and silent companion is more than usable as a game mechanic 
(especially in such a simple type of game as the one we’re making), there’s nothing wrong 
with giving companions a little personality as well. I use self-switches to make sure that 
the event only triggers once; otherwise, the player will be trapped in an endless loop 
when he/she steps on one event or the other.
The boss event itself is two pages long and uses the graphic shown in Figure 8-5 
(located in the Evil graphic set).

As you can see (and as I promised in Chapter 6 that I would cover), I have the game 
change the Battle BGM before Lamia attacks the player. This will change the music into 
something a little more appropriate for a boss battle. Lamia’s troop event has four pages. 
The first one triggers at the start of the battle; the next three trigger at 25% HP intervals. 
So, page 2 would trigger when Lamia is at 75% HP remaining, page 3 triggers when she’s 
at half health, and page 4 triggers when she is at 25% HP. Each of the four troop event 
pages has a Span of Battle (which causes them to trigger only once when their conditions 
are met).

As you can see, I decided to add some banter to Lamia’s boss fight. Since the player 
cannot escape the battle, I flip the LamiaDefeated switch on page 1, which will cause the 
boss event graphic to disappear from the dungeon level map once the player has defeated 
Lamia. Note the use of the Force Action command, especially the first instance it is used. 
Lamia using Blizzard tells the player that she can also cast spells (only Blizzard, but it’s 
still a valid warning).

Life After Lamia
So, the player has fought long and hard to defeat the vile snake monster, Lamia. What 
comes next? The first thing to do is add an Autorun event to the Pixies’ Forest (East) 
map that requires that LamiaDefeated be set to on. It will be two pages long. The most 
important thing to do in the first page of the event is make sure to change the Battle BGM 
back to its system default, or the boss BGM will play in every battle.

When the player defeats Lamia, Titania teleports the player back to the Pixies’ Vale 
(the exact transfer location puts the player in front of Titania). As you may have inferred, 
we’ll need an Autorun event in the Vale’s interior; otherwise, the game will hang with a 
black screen, as there is no Fadein Screen command to complement the previous Fadeout 
Screen used. The Vale interior Autorun event is also composed of two pages.

There really isn’t much to it, save for the fact that it would’ve broken the flow of the

DeepestDungeonFloor throughout the game, haven’t you?) The transfer event, logically, 
is currently useless, but that will change when I cover the Ancient Temple in the next 
chapter.
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we created the eastern half of the Pixies’ Forest, our 
dungeon crawler’s fifth level. The player’s Magic Oar was upgraded into a Magic Sail that 
can summon a ship capable of traveling through deep water. In addition, the player faced 
down and defeated Lamia, a vicious snake monster being kept in check by Titania. In the 
next chapter, the player will make his/her way to the Ancient Temple, a timeless locale 
containing the coveted hidden artifact.

Chapter 9
The Ancient Temple
In this chapter, we will be working on our dungeon’s final level, the Ancient Temple. The 
player will have to destroy a pair of braziers that form a wall of fire that shields the prize. 
Enemies are many and at their strongest, as befits a final level.
The Ancient Temple
The player’s expected level heading into the Ancient Temple is 15. The game’s final level 
will provide sufficient experience to reach Level 19. Should the player wish to reach the 
maximum of 20, he/she will have to leave the Temple and return, to prompt the enemies 
to re-spawn. Here are the things to cover in this chapter.
• 
Highly variable encounters: There will be four new enemy types 
in this level, the last of which will serve in the capacity of a pair of 
mini-bosses. When the player collides with an enemy sprite, he/
she will be attacked by one of seven different troops.
• 
The final objective: The hidden artifact is located at the very back 
of the Ancient Temple, behind a wall of fire sustained by a pair of 
braziers. The player must destroy the braziers to reach the artifact.
• 
The credits: Once the player grabs the artifact, the game will end. 
We will have to provide an event to cover this.
What Does the Town Greeter Have to Say?
To think that we built our city atop the ruins of an ancient temple. 
Perhaps that is the way of the world: to be built, to decay, and to be built 
upon again. Be careful with those lost souls that wander the temple...
The town greeter doesn’t know too much about the dungeon below; why do you ask?

Level Overview
Our game’s final level is a 47×47 sized map with the Dungeon tileset, the Field2 BGM at 
50% Pitch, and a Cobblestones4 and Temple battleback. Afterward, see Figure 9-1 for a 
screenshot of the level in completed form.

The first thing about the Ancient Temple that should leap to mind is the total lack 
of treasure chests. The player has reached the bottom of the dungeon. His/Her only 
objective is to find the hidden artifact. Everything else is just an obstacle. The rocks 
behind the player’s starting point will return a message if the player interacts with them. 
Here’s the relevant event:
Priority: Same as characters
Trigger: Action Button
Text: None, Window, Bottom
:     : The way out is blocked by rocks. You'll need to
:     : use an item or magic to leave the Ancient Temple.
As Titania had warned toward the end of the previous chapter, the only way out of 
the Ancient Temple (besides finding the hidden artifact itself and winning the game) is 
via the Return Crystals or the Return spell.
The Enemies of the Ancient Temple
The game’s final level will have enemies representing all those adventurers lost to the 
dungeon throughout the ages. The encounter event (and battle sprites for each of the 
enemies) will be covered later in the section. For now, take a look at Table 9-1, to see the 
stats of each of the four enemies present within the Ancient Temple.

The Dark Priest serves as the level’s mini-boss. When the player seeks to destroy one

Priest to gain access to the brazier itself. See Table 9-2 for additional details concerning 
enemies.

The Dark Priests
The Ancient Temple houses a pair of Dark Priests, each guarding a brazier blocking 
access to the ancient artifact. Much like the Living Statues back in Chapter 5, the Dark 
Priests will disappear from the game permanently when defeated. The event used for the 
level’s mini-bosses is actually simpler than the one we will use for our regular encounters. 
Each Dark Priest event is two pages long and consists of the following event code. See 
Figure 9-2 for the Dark Priest’s graphic.

damage. We want Umbral Embrace to inflict more damage the longer the battle has been 
in progress. How can we do this? It’s really simple. Here’s the single troop event page for 
the Dark Priest:
Condition: Turn End
Span: Turn
Control Variables: #0006 turncount += 1

Yes, seriously. That’s all you need. At the end of each turn, the value of turncount will 
be increased by 1. Of course, the player must battle two Dark Priests in this level. If we 
store the value of turncount and don’t erase it at some point, the player will be powerless 
to beat the second Dark Priest (as the Umbral Embrace will inflict a disproportionately 
high amount of damage, based on the duration of the first Dark Priest fight). To fix that, 
you need only have another troop event page (for the sake of consistency, this should be 
page 1; the preceding code above this paragraph should be page 2).
Condition: Turn  0
Span: Battle
Control Variables: 0006 turncount = 0

There you have it! When the player attacks the second Dark Priest, the preceding 
code will reset the turncount variable, and then the other code will trigger at the end of 
each turn, counting up appropriately.
The Lost Adventurers
As hinted by the town greeter, lost souls wander the temple’s halls. These are the 
adventurers who have quested for the hidden artifact since the world learned of its 
existence. They are now bound to protect the artifact until defeated once again. In the 
spirit of the final level, they are meant more to be a hindrance than actual enemies that 
the player should try to actively fight. However, should the player decide to do so, the 
enemies have a chance of dropping the rarest weapons and armor in the game. The 
event is rather long, despite only having a single page. That is due to the fact that we have 
seven distinct possibilities for enemy encounters. It’s also important to note that the 
player will be unable to escape any battle in the Ancient Temple. This provides additional 
incentive to reach the artifact as soon as possible. Figure 9-3 shows the graphic for regular 
encounters in the Ancient Temple.

Of course, that leaves a single question: What do the enemy battlers look like? During

as the enemies themselves (the Living Statue, for example). See Figure 9-4 for a look at 
the battler graphics used for the enemies of the Ancient Temple.
Barrier to the End 
Only a single wall of fire stands in the way of the player attaining the ancient artifact. Once 
the player defeats a Dark Priest, he/she will be able to interact with the brazier atop the 
pedestal and destroy it. Upon destroying both braziers, the area will shake, and the wall of 
fire will be extinguished. Once the player interacts with the hidden artifact, the game will 
end. With all of that said, let’s take it one step at a time.

The Wall of Fire
The barrier preventing the player from reaching the hidden artifact is a three-tile-long 
path of fire. Each individual square is its own event, but they will all be the same. The wall 
of fire events are located at (24,16), (24,17), and (27,18) See Figure 9-7 for the relevant fire

With the braziers destroyed, the player can finally claim what he/she has sought for six

Pretty beefy event, isn’t it? Yet, there’s not much to it. In a nutshell
• 
The player interacts with the artifact.
• 
The game asks the player if he/she wishes to grab the artifact.
• 
If no, nothing happens.
• 
If yes, the screen fades out and a postgame message is written out, 
depending on the player character.
• 
Afterward, the credits are played and the game returns the player 
to the title screen.
Note how each of the ending messages gives a plot hook that can be used to extend 
the game. Speaking of extending the game, I’m going to tackle an alternate situation 
before we move on to the final chapter of this book. What if the player has to escape the 
dungeon without the aid of Return (the spell or the item)?
The Great Escape
After countless trials and tribulations, the player has finally attained the ancient artifact. 
However, doing so has awoken an equally ancient spirit, and that spirit is not pleased. It 
will chase the player and attack him/her until it has defeated the player, or until the player 
has stepped onto the staircase leading into Eagle’s Crossing. We will use common events 
to have the enemy attack the player at regular intervals. Once the player reaches Eagle’s 
Crossing, he/she wins the game.
The Ancient Spirit
The first order of business is to create the enemy that will haunt our player as he/
she makes his/her way back up the dungeon. The enemy battler sprite to be used is 
Ghost with a Hue of 240. See Figure 9-9 for a screenshot of the Ancient Spirit’s relevant 
information.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9 ■ The Ancient Temple
192
The Ancient Spirit has twice the health of the Dark Priests that the player defeated to 
acquire the hidden artifact. In a manner of speaking, it has the power to be a final boss. 
Yet, how the player will be engaged by this foe is a very unique affair.
Encountering the Ancient Spirit
For the purposes of this exercise, I will be adding a third choice to the yes/no the player is 
given upon interacting with the ancient artifact. When the player selects the third choice, 
a common event named StepsToAncientSpirit will be called. After the common event 
code has run its course, the ArtifactGet switch will be flipped on, and a second common 
event (AncientSpiritEncounter) with a Parallel Process trigger will be called. This is 
what this sequence of events will do:
• 
In StepsToAncientSpirit, we use a pair of variables to hold 
a static number (StepsN) and the player’s current number 
of steps taken (StepsTaken). Then, we use the Script event 
command to add two random numbers and one static number 
together, based on the value of StepsN. We save the result to the 
StepsToEncounter variable.
• 
We turn on the ArtifactGet switch and call the 
AncientSpiritEncounter event.
• 
AncientSpiritEncounter uses another variable called 
StepsTakenOnMap to determine how many steps the player has 
taken toward encountering the Ancient Spirit. A conditional 
branch checks to see if StepsTakenOnMap is greater than or equal 
to StepsToEncounter. If it is, the player is attacked by the Ancient 
Spirit.
Figure 9-9.  The Ancient Spirit. Note that it drops no items or gold when defeated

Chapter 9 ■ The Ancient Temple

• 
If the player wins the battle, we set StepsToEncounter to 
100 and jump back to the start of the common event. If the 
player escapes the battle, we repeat the process performed in 
StepsToAncientSpirit.
Why is this necessary? In essence, what I am doing here is using common events to 
create a random encounter. You’re probably considering the fact that it would be easier 
just to add the Ancient Spirit encounter to every level of our game and then use the 
Change Encounter event command to enable random encounters once the player has 
acquired the hidden artifact. That is only true if you have a single enemy you want the 
player to encounter in this way. Otherwise, you’ll have to apply this method. First, have 
the code that needs to be added to the artifact event.
Add Alternate Path to the already existent Show Choices event command. Then, 
add the following code:
: When No
  Jump to Label: No
  
: When Alternate Path
  Common Event: [StepsToAncientSpirit]
  Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :     : You grab the artifact and feel a malevolent presence
  :     : enter the area!
  Text: None, Window, Bottom

  :     : of the Ancient Spirit prevents escape through magical
  :     : means!
  Jump to Label: Run!
  
: End
Between Return To Title Screen and Label: No, add the following code:
Label: Run!
Transfer Player: Level 5 (14,37) (Direction: Down)
So, when the alternate path is taken, the player will receive a warning message and 
will be spirited away to Level 5 (the exact destination is where Lamia used to stand before 
being defeated). From there, the player must make his/her way to the surface. Now, here’s 
the code for both of the common events to be used for this exercise:
StepsToAncientSpirit
Control Variables: #0010 StepsN = 20
Control Variables: #0008 StepsTaken = Steps
Script: var n = $gameVariables.value(10);
:       : var x = 18 + Math.randomInt(n) + Math.randomInt(n);
:       : $gameVariables.setValue(9,x);
Control Switches: #0018 ArtifactGet = ON
Common Event: AncientSpiritEncounter

www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9 ■ The Ancient Temple
194
■
■Note  Instead of using StepsN to hold the value of n, you could define n within the 
Script event command. I did it this slightly longer way, as it makes it a bit easier to change 
the value of n when desired. Math.randomInt is a JavaScript method that exists within 
an expanded library for math-based code called Math.js. As its name implies, it is used for 
creating random numbers. You pass Math.randomInt a parameter telling it the range of 
values that you want it to pick from, so, for example, Math.randomInt(6) will pick randomly 
from a sequence of six values. JavaScript is zero-based, so the sequence begins at 0.  
Math.randomInt(6) will provide a random number from 0 to 5. If you want to emulate a die 
roll and start from 1, just add 1 to the final result. So, Math.randomInt(6)+1 will give you a 
result between the range of 1 and 6. In MV’s flavoring of $gameVariables, you can write to 
a variable via the use of .setValue in the form of $gameVariables.setValue(var,value), 
where var is the variable number (9 in this case) and value is self-explanatory (in this case, 
the value of x). Thus, the number saved to variable 9 is 18 plus the sum of two random 
numbers (as picked by the Math.randomInt method) that range from 0 to 19.

So, what happens when the player is attacked by the Ancient Spirit? The Ancient 
Spirit has four troop event pages. I wanted this particular battle to be special, so I made it 
so that the battle ends on the fourth turn after starting. Any damage the player manages 
to inflict on the Ancient Spirit will persist between battles. If the player should manage 
to drop the Ancient Spirit’s HP to 0, it will be defeated and allow the player 100 steps of 
reprieve before attacking again. With that said, here are the four troop event pages for the 
Ancient Spirit battle.


At the start of the battle (page 1), we give the Ancient Spirit the Immortal state (the 
sole purpose of applying this state is so that we can execute page 4 of its troop event 
if necessary). Then, we lower the enemy’s HP by an amount equal to the value of the 
SpiritDamage variable. Afterward, we save the Ancient Spirit’s current HP into the 
SpiritCurrentHP variable and save the difference between 500 (the Ancient Spirit’s 
maximum HP) and SpiritCurrentHP to the SpiritDamage variable. This is done because 
each battle with the Ancient Spirit lasts a maximum of four turns, so we want to keep 
track of its HP between battles (a given battle can end earlier if the Ancient Spirit drops to 
0 HP, as coded in page 4 of its troop event).
■
■Tip  You can use the Script Operand in Control Variables to write equations
At the end of each turn (page 2), we check the Ancient Spirit’s HP and save the 
appropriate values to SpiritDamage and SpiritCurrentHP. On the fourth turn (page 3),  
the battle is aborted, but not before setting StepsTaken to the player’s current 
number of steps and using the Script snippet to set the value of StepsToEncounter 
($gameVariables.value(9)) to determine when the player will next encounter the 
Ancient Spirit. The fourth and last page is triggered if the Ancient Spirit’s HP is reduced to 
0. In that case, we set SpiritCurrentHP to 500 and SpiritDamage to 0 (effectively resetting 
the enemy’s HP in preparation for the next fight) and remove Immortal, so that the 
Ancient Spirit can be properly defeated.
No Return, Yes Escape
So, as noted immediately before the start of the Great Escape section, the player will be 
unable to use Return in any shape or form to escape the dungeon. Instead, he/she must 
break free of the dungeon the long way. To accomplish this, we’ll have to edit the relevant 
Return common events.
■
■Tip   You can adapt the event code we used back in Chapter 6 to prevent the player 
from using Return to leave the room Minotaur appeared in.

Last, but not least important, we must disable the portal in the Pixies’ Vale that leads 
directly to Eagle’s Crossing (as easy as adding a second event page that lacks a transfer 
event and gives an error message concerning the Ancient Spirit) and edit the transfer 
event that leads back to Eagle’s Crossing on the first dungeon level. The former should be 
easy enough to add, so I’ll leave it to you, as an exercise. Following, you can see the event

As you can see, while ArtifactGet is off, the player will be returned to Eagle’s

switch is turned off, and the credits are rolled. At the end of it all, the player will be 
looking at the title screen once again.
Congratulations!
As per the section title, I do believe that congratulations are in order. You have just 
completed your very own 2D role-playing game in a single weekend! Give yourself a 
pat on the back and a round of applause. You deserve it! Now, you are armed with the 
necessary tools to continue working on this game (or any other game concept you come 
up with in the future). With that said, there is still one chapter left in this book. It will 
cover things I did not cover in these first nine chapters. For starters, I’ll finally talk about 
that mysterious nonplayer character in the lower-right corner of Eagle’s Crossing. Look 
forward to it!
Summary
During the course of this chapter, we created the Ancient Temple, our game’s final level. 
The player fought his/her way through the lost souls of the past to defeat a pair of Dark 
Priests blocking braziers. Those braziers were sustaining a wall of fire that prevented 
the player from reaching the hidden artifact and winning the game. Upon reaching and 
grabbing the artifact, the player finds out what happens next with his/her character 
of choice. An alternate hypothetical situation was explored as well. In this book’s final 
chapter, I will discuss several interesting ways to expand the game that we have created 
together.

Chapter 10
What Comes Next
This chapter focuses on features we can add to our game to make it more lively and  
to add complexity. As promised, the first topic concerns the mysterious nonplayer  
character (NPC) that lives in the southeastern corner of Eagle’s Crossing.
The Bazaar NPC
This particular NPC runs a shop unlike any other in our game. Instead of the static list of 
items every other shop provides, his shop is stocked with random items. It didn’t really 
seem appropriate to discuss him in previous chapters, given the fact that he gave the 
player nothing that couldn’t already be attained in another shop. However, I think the 
whole concept of a shop with a random inventory is cool, so let’s begin.
Overview
Here is a list of things you’ll require to create a bazaar:
• 
The NPC itself
• 
A script page that contains the logic for the addition of random 
items to a shop list
• 
The list of items, armor, or weapons that you would like the 
bazaar to have on offer. I’ll be using items for my bazaar, but you 
can use armor or weapons instead.
• 
A common event that uses a pair of conditional branches to 
ensure that the bazaar list isn’t rerolled until desired
Perhaps the most involved part of this NPC is the script page, so let’s begin with that.
Shop Processing—Scripting Style Start
To script the Bazaar, we must first understand how to use scripting to emulate the Shop 
Processing event command. RPG Maker MV (unlike Ace) uses JavaScript for scripting. 
Also, if you have used Ace previously, you may be shocked to find out that the internal

Script Editor does not exist anymore. That’s the bad news. The good news is that you can 
download any advanced text editor or IDE (integrated development environment) to 
access MV’s code (which is neatly located in a series of .js files in the appropriately named 
js folder of any RMMV project). For the purposes of this book, I will be using Atom, a 
really nice text editor that can automatically detect if text from a given file is plain text 
or part of one of various programming languages such as Python, Ruby, or (obviously) 
JavaScript.
Downloading and Running Atom
To download Atom, follow these steps.
• 
For Windows users: Go to https://atom.io and click on the 
Download Windows Installer button.
• 
For Mac users: Click on other platforms under the Download 
Windows Installer button and find the atom-mac.zip file. 
Alternately, use this link: https://github.com/atom/atom/
releases/download/v1.2.1/atom-mac.zip
There are technically Linux builds of Atom but, as RMMV does not run on Linux, 
that’s beyond the scope of this discussion. Once you have downloaded Atom, run the 
Setup file and wait for it to finish installing. Once the program is done installing, it should 
start automatically.
■
■Tip  On Windows 7 at least (not sure how it installs on Macs), Atom installs to a really 
odd directory path and doesn’t create a shortcut on Desktop. The easiest way to create a 
desktop shortcut is to click on Open File from within Atom. Since it is your first time opening 
the program, the browse file window will default to the directory where Atom is located. 
Then, you need only find the executable and create a shortcut from it that you then set to 
the Desktop. If this doesn’t help, here’s the directory path it installed to on my computer for 
reference: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\atom\.
So, if you have gotten this far, it is time to keep going! In Atom, go to the File menu 
and select Open File. Once the browse file window opens, find your game project (in 
Windows 7, RMMV projects save by default to the Games folder located in Documents), 
open its associated folder, and then open the js folder. The .js file we want to open is 
called rpg_objects.js. Left-click on the file (or double-click) and then click Ok. Once the 
file has been opened within Atom, it’s time to keep going with this chapter.

Shop Processing—Scripting Style Continue
Within Atom, go to the Find submenu and click on Find on Buffer (alternately, you can 
press Ctrl + F for the same effect). We’re going to run a search for Shop Processing. Atom 
will find a single result. Clicking on Find after that should send you to the following code 
(located in the Game_Interpreter portion of rpg_objects.js; starting at line 10120):
Game_Interpreter.prototype.command302 = function() {
    if (!$gameParty.inBattle()) {
        var goods = [this._params];
        while (this.nextEventCode() === 605) {
            this._index++;
            goods.push(this.currentCommand().parameters);
        }
        SceneManager.push(Scene_Shop);
        SceneManager.prepareNextScene(goods, this._params[4]);
    }
    return true;
};
Starting from the top, command_302 is a method within the Game_Interpreter 
function.
• 
Recall how events work: they execute from top to bottom, unless 
you use Labels to skip ahead or backtrack. Code works in much 
the same way. In this case, execution of the command_302 method 
will be skipped if the player is in battle (the reason being, as you 
can imagine, that you can’t enter shops while in battle).
• 
The goods variable (declared as var goods) contains the list 
of items that are to be sold at a particular shop. The brackets 
after the equal sign signify an array. Fittingly enough, an array 
in programming is a list of items. The this keyword is used in 
JavaScript to denote that the variable used at that moment is an 
instance. In this case, this._params is an instance variable that 
fills the array.
• 
while is a type of loop. The code contained within the loop will 
be executed as long as the expression to the right of the while 
remains true. nextEventCode() is an internal value used for a  
lot of RMMV’s event commands. All you have to know in this case 
is that 605 is the value that nextEventCode holds when it has not 
yet completed adding items to the shop.
• 
Within the loop itself, we have this._index++. _index is an 
instance variable and the ++ afterward is the post increment 
operator. This is a JavaScript operator that causes its associated 
variable to increment by 1, but not before giving whatever value it 
had before being incremented.

• 
.push is an array method that, as its name implies, adds an item 
to the end of the current array.
• 
From there to the end, the rest of the method is fairly clear-cut. 
Basically, the Shop Scene is called, and then the shop is prepared. 
As noted, the list of items is contained in the goods parameter. 
The this._params[4] instance variable determines whether the 
shop allows or disallows selling.
On the subject of scripting, Archeia (over at the official RPG Maker web site) created 
a thread that covers Script calls for events in RPG Maker MV. Here’s a Google document 
containing the Script Calls: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Oa0cRGpjC8
L5JO8vdMwOaYMKO75dtfKDOetnvh7OHs/edit?pli=1#gid=0. More importantly, she wrote 
the following Ruby code up in a thread for RPG Maker VX Ace. As I’ll prove shortly, this 
can be adapted to JavaScript (and thus MV).
goods = [[type, id, price_override_flag(, price)]]
SceneManager.call(Scene_Shop)
SceneManager.scene.prepare(goods, true)
 
# Example Script Call:
goods = [[0,1,1,25],[0,2,0]]
SceneManager.call(Scene_Shop)
SceneManager.scene.prepare(goods, true)
 
# You can also use a loop to add the elements to the array:
goods = []
for id in 1..20
  goods.push([0, id, 0])
end
The preceding Ruby code should make things a lot easier to understand. To 
illustrate, let’s take the example script call, turn it into valid JavaScript, and then assign it 
to our mysterious NPC. 
• 
In JavaScript, we need to declare a variable before we can assign 
anything to it. So, instead of goods, we would write var goods. 
The rest of that line of code stays as is (although we do need to 
close the end of the line with a semi-colon).
• 
In RMMV, there is no longer a .call method for the SceneManager. 
Attempts to use .call will just trigger a “static class” Error within 
MV (as SceneManager is a static class that cannot be instantiated). 
Instead, to perform the same function, we use SceneManager 
.push(sceneClass). In this case, sceneClass is Scene_Shop.
• 
As in the previous bullet, SceneManager.scene.prepare() 
is no longer used in RMMV. Instead, we use SceneManager.
prepareNextScene(), which accepts the same parameters that 
the legacy method used to (albeit with slightly different names, 
although that is irrelevant for this exercise).
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
203
With that said and done, here’s the JavaScript version of the example script call.
var goods = [[0,1,1,25],[0,2,0]];
SceneManager.push(Scene_Shop);
SceneManager.prepareNextScene(goods, true);
Now for the fun part! Take these three lines of code and copy them into a Script event 
command for the NPC in the bottom-right corner of Eagle’s Crossing.
Now, when the player interacts with that NPC, a shop will come up. According to 
how the Items tab of my Database has been organized, the preceding code should result 
in me seeing Lesser Healing Potions on sale for 25 gold and Lesser Magic Potions for 20 
gold. How can I be so sure of this? Well, let’s take another look at the very first line of code 
I copy-pasted from the relevant forum thread for RPG Maker VX Ace.
goods = [[type, id, price_override_flag(, price)]]
This is the format for individual items that get saved into goods, and it holds four 
parameters (which thankfully are handled in the same way in RMMV, which means that 
this code is forward-compatible).
	
1.	
type refers to the item type within RMMV. Items are 0, 
Weapons are 1, and Armors are 2. So, both of the shop items 
in the example script call are Items.
	
2.	
id refers to the ID number of the item, weapon, or armor 
within the RMMV Database. As we created these two potions 
first (all the way back in Chapter 2, in fact), the sample items 
should be Lesser Healing Potion and Lesser Magic Potion, 
respectively.
	
3.	
price_override_flag is the Script equivalent of the Price box 
in the Shop Processing event command dialog menu. If set to 0  
(false), the item’s price will be set to its default. If set to 1 
(true), you must define the item’s new price.
	
4.	
price is only needed if you have set price_override_flag to 1.  
In that case, you would set here the new price for the item in 
question.
Of course, you’re probably looking at this and wondering how you can make a 
random shop. Well, read on, and I’ll tell you all about how I did it.
Creating the Bazaar
Because we want to create a shop that has random items, we need a way to randomize 
what gets plugged into the item arrays for goods. We can use Math.randomInt to much the 
same effect as we did in the previous chapter. For the sake of simplicity, the price override 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
204
flag will always be off, so the price of the item will be its default Database price. Here’s a 
breakdown of the bazaar script functionality:
• 
The random item shop will hold five items.
• 
The main engine of the shop will be a while loop that triggers 
while the value of i  (a local variable used within the script call) is 
less than 5. . id is the variable in charge of holding the ID number. 
Since we only want the first fourteen items to have a chance to 
land in the Bazaar (as subsequent items are either Scrolls,  
items meant to be sold, or Key Items), we set id to be equal to  
1 + Math.randomInt(14).
• 
Afterward, we can push the completed item into the goods 
variable. To conclude, the value of i is increased by 1.
• 
If i reaches 5, the script breaks out of the while loop and calls up 
the shop.
• 
Last, but not least, we save the contents of our goods variable to 
variable ID 3 via the use of the $gameVariables.setValue()method.
With the preceding information in hand, you are now ready to see the code for this 
special shop.
var goods = [];
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  var id = 1 + Math.randomInt(14);
  goods.push([0,id,0]); 
  i++;
}
$gameVariables.setValue(3,goods);
SceneManager.push(Scene_Shop); 
SceneManager.prepareNextScene(goods, true);
Finishing Up the Bazaar
With the scripting out of the way, we can now create a common event to encapsulate a 
pair of script calls. We run the full script call completed in the previous section while a 
specific switch (which we’ll call Bazaar) is off. Then, to prevent the Bazaar’s inventory from 
re-randomizing until intended, we set the Bazaar switch to on. Interacting with the NPC 
while Bazaar is on will cause the game to run a shorter script call that uses the contents 
of $gameVariables(3) (recall how we set its value to goods at the end of the script call) to 
bring up the same shop that was created previously. It is as easy as the following event code:
¨If: Bazaar is ON
¨Script: SceneManager.push(Scene_Shop);
  :     : SceneManager.prepareNextScene($gameVariables.value(3), true);
  ¨
: End
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
205
¨If: Bazaar is OFF
  ¨Script: var goods = [];
  :      : var i = 0;
  :      : while (i < 5) {
  :      :   var id = 1 + Math.randomInt(14);
  :      :   goods.push([0,id,0]);
  :      :   i++;
  :      : }
  :      : $gameVariables.setValue(3,goods);
  :      : SceneManager.push(Scene_Shop);
  :      : SceneManager.prepareNextScene(goods, true);
  ¨Control Switches : #0010 Bazaar = ON
  ¨
: End
¨
Finally, whichever NPC you decide to assign as your bazaar shopkeeper requires 
only the following line of code:
¨Common Event:  [Bazaar]
Figure 10-1 shows a sample roll of the Bazaar.
Figure 10-1.  A five-item Bazaar. Note the item duplication 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
206
So, here are some things to consider when using this code:
• 
There is a possibility that you will receive two copies of the same 
item, given that the script has no way of checking against that  
(as evidenced in Figure 10-1).
■
■Note  You can add anti-duplication checks to the Bazaar shop once you gain some more 
scripting knowledge. All you would have to do is check to see if the item already exists in 
the new array and re-roll if it does.
• 
If you want the shop’s inventory to change, you’ll have to turn off 
the Bazaar switch. Some good times to allow the shop to re-roll its 
stock include when the player reaches a new level, the player rests 
at an inn, or when an important plot point is reached.
The Plugin Manager
After spending quite a few pages working on the Bazaar, it’s about time to talk a bit more 
about the Plugin Manager. Kadokawa Games decided to simplify RPG Maker MV for 
newer users by removing the Script Editor and adding the Plugin Manager. However, not 
all is doom and gloom. We already established that you can still access the engine’s script 
files and even use them as inspiration for script calls. Of course, script calls have a big 
problem: They only have 12 lines of space. So, what is an aspiring scripter to do if they 
need more space? Make a plugin! While the actual creation of a plugin is well beyond the 
scope of this book, I still felt the need to talk a bit about the manager, since it’s there.
RPG Maker MV brings a total of seven plugins already stored within the plugins 
folder of any newly created project. Our dungeon crawler is not an exception. For the 
purposes of showing off the Plugin Manager, let’s add one of the existent plugins to our 
game! Follow these steps. 
• 
Press F10 while using RPG Maker MV (alternately, click on Tools 
and then Plugin Manager). This will bring up the Plugin Manager, 
which is currently filled with a whole lot of nothing. Time to 
change that.
• 
Double-click (or right-click and then press Edit) on the first line 
(which should be the only one selectable) which should bring up 
a screen very much like that shown in Figure 10-2.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
207
Incidentally, the plugin shown in Figure 10-2 is the one that we’re going to add to our 
game. It’s as easy as selecting it from the Name dropdown menu and then making sure its 
Status is set to ON. So, what does this plugin do exactly? Well, it changes the menu from 
its standard layout (featuring the menu commands horizontally placed) to a layout where 
the menu commands are vertically placed, as shown in Figure 10-3.

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
208
The Next Leg of the Journey
The player has acquired the hidden artifact and seen the endgame credits. However,  
the beauty of a dungeon crawler is that there can always be more dungeons to crawl. In 
this section, I will cover the following:
• 
Creating a portal event that activates at certain “steps taken” intervals.
• 
If the player uses the portal, he/she will be taken to one of three 
special mini-dungeons that lead to a fourth mini-dungeon.
• 
The final mini-dungeon will have a pair of exits that lead to a 
treasure room. The player will have to take both exits to get all of 
the dungeon’s treasure.
• 
Once the player has completed the dungeon, he/she will be 
returned to Eagle’s Crossing.
A Portal Appears
The first order of business is to create a portal that does the following:
• 
Appears when the player’s step count is a multiple of 250
• 
Stays open until the player has taken 100 steps
• 
Closes until the next time the player’s step count is a  
multiple of 250
• 
Sends the player to one of three random locations
To accomplish this, we’ll need a Parallel event to handle the portal’s appearance and 
subsequent disappearance and an Action Button event for the actual portal. The Parallel 
event will have a total of two pages, and the portal event will have a single page. Here’s the 
first page of the Parallel event.
¨Control Variables: #0008 StepsTaken = Steps
¨Control Variables: #0022 PortalCount = $gameVariables(8) % 250
¨If: PortalCount = 0
  ¨Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :     : A portal has materialized in the area!
  ¨Control Variables: #0022 PortalCount = StepsTaken
  ¨Control Variables: #0022 PortalCount += 100
  ¨Control Switches: #0020 PortalOpen = ON
  ¨
: End
¨
Perhaps the most interesting line of the preceding code is the second one. What’s up 
with that percent symbol? That is the modulus operator, which gives an alternate result 
for division. Let’s say that StepsTaken is equal to 125. 125 divided by 250 would be 0.5. 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
209
However, the result of 125 % 250 is 125. Why? What the modulus operator is giving you is 
the remainder left after the nearest whole division. So, for example, 10 mod 3 returns 1, 
because 3 goes into 10 three times (to give 9), leaving 1. 11 mod 3 would be 2, and 12 mod 
3 would be 0, because 12 divides by 3 exactly. It’s those exact divisions that we’re looking 
for. Going back to our event code, we get the aforementioned exact divisions at intervals 
of 250 (250, 500, 750, etc.). This is what we require to ensure the portal is opening at the 
correct step intervals.
■
■Note  You can find a neat modulus operator calculator at www.miniwebtool.com/
modulo-calculator/.
After that realization, the rest of the event should be rather clear. When PortalCount 
is equal to 0, the player will receive a message notifying him/her that the portal has 
opened. Then, the value of PortalCount is set to that of StepsTaken and subsequently 
increased by 100 (that will keep the portal open for 100 steps). Finally, the PortalOpen 
switch is set to on, which leads to the second page in this Parallel event.
Condition: 0020 PortalOpen 
¨Control Variables: #0008 StepsTaken = Steps
¨If: PortalCount = StepsTaken
  ¨Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :     : The portal has closed!
  ¨Control Variables: #0022 PortalCount = Steps
  ¨Control Switches: #0020 PortalOpen = OFF
  ¨
: End
¨
Because we want to compare the value of StepsTaken with the value of PortalCount, 
we use Control Variables to keep StepsTaken updated. Once StepsTaken catches up to 
PortalCount, we display a message declaring that the portal has closed, set the value 
of PortalCount to the player’s Steps count, and then turn off the PortalOpen switch, 
returning the Parallel event to page 1.
Using the Portal
The portal spawning and closing events are nice and all, but we need an event that 
represents the portal itself. As with most events that require interaction, I’ll make this one 
have a Same as characters priority with an Action Button trigger.
Condition: 0020 PortalOpen
¨Text: None, Window, Bottom
:     : You see a portal before you. Will you step through?
¨Show Choices: Yes, No (Window, Right, #1, #2)
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
210
: When Yes
  ¨Text: None, Window, Bottom
  :     : You step through the portal.
  ¨Control Variables: #0004 d3 = Random 1...3
  ¨If: d3 = 1
    ¨Transfer Player: Bonus Dungeon (6,6) (Direction: Down)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨If: d3 = 2
    ¨Transfer Player: Bonus Dungeon (33,5) (Direction: Down)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨If: d3 = 3
    ¨Transfer Player: Bonus Dungeon (9,35) (Direction: Down)
    ¨
  : End
  ¨
: When No
  ¨
: End
¨
When the player steps through the portal, we store a random number between 1 and 3  
in the d3 variable. The player is sent to a mini-dungeon dependent on what number is 
present in d3 at that time. See Figure 10-4 for a picture of the extra dungeon.
Figure 10-4.  The dungeon to which the portal leads. Note that each of the three individual 
locations is marked numerically
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
211
If d3 is equal to 1, the player will be sent to the northwestern quadrant. If d3 is equal 
to 2, the player will be sent to the northeastern quadrant. If it should be equal to 3, the 
player will be sent to the southern quadrant. Once the player has arrived at his/her 
particular mini-dungeon, his/her next objective is to reach the dungeon’s inner sanctum. 
This is accomplished by reaching the exit at the far end of his/her mini-dungeon, which 
locates the player at the top entrance of the central quadrant. Then, the path to the inner 
sanctum is as simple as reaching one of the two exits in the area. See Figure 10-5 for a 
look at the treasure room. 
You can place whatever items you like into those chests. Now, let’s tweak the portal 
event a little.
A Random Portal
The previous event for the portal makes it so that it appears out of thin air at a specific 
location (mainly, wherever the event for the portal is placed). However, what happens 
if you want to place the portal within one of the dungeon levels? We could always place 
it at a static location, but we could also make it so that it spawns at a random location 
each time that it appears. For this exercise, let’s use Level 5 as an example. I made a copy 
of the blank map and renamed it appropriately. Then, I set out to fix a basic problem. 
Think about this situation: you are the player and have received a message that a portal 
has materialized somewhere on the level. What happens if the portal spawns behind a 
wall or in the middle of an ocean? The player may not be able to reach it, and that is a big 
Figure 10-5.  The inner sanctum of the bonus dungeon. The left entrance is where the 
player arrives, if he/she takes the western exit out of the central quadrant. The right 
entrance is the player’s destination if he/she takes the eastern exit

212
problem. How do we solve this problem? We can paint valid portal spawn locations with 
the Region tool and then check the portal’s spawn position to make sure that it appears in 
a proper location.
Spawning the Random Portal
First of all, let’s paint the land tiles in the blank dungeon level with Region #55.  
See Figure 10-6.
■
■Note  Alternatively, you could have used a Terrain Tag to mark the appropriate tiles.
Once that is done, place the portal event we created previously in one of the map’s 
corners. Remove the switch conditional (such that the event is always visible). Then, let’s 
tweak the Parallel event. For the sake of simplicity, I won’t be giving the portal a finite life 
span, as I did in the previous section. Here’s the Parallel event, now with code to make 
sure the portal spawns in a valid location:
Page 1 of 2

¨If: Region = 55
  ¨Control Switches: #0020 PortalOpen = ON
  ¨
: End
¨
 
Page 2 of 2
Condition: Switch 0020 PortalOpen
Trigger: Action Button
The first thing to note is the addition of a pair of Control Variable event commands to 
set X and Y to random values. The range of numbers is set to the minimum and maximum 
limits of the map itself. That makes sure that the portal has to spawn on the map and 
prevents any possible bugs or glitches. After the event crunches X and Y, it moves the 
portal event to the relevant location. Then, through the use of Get Location Info, we 
determine whether the portal is on accessible land (marked by Region #55) or not (left 
unmarked). A pair of conditional branches handles what happens next. If the portal is on 
Region #55, we set PortalOpen to on, which stops the event from executing, by switching 
to a blank page 2. Otherwise, we jump back to the Repeat label and have the code re-
randomize the portal’s X and Y. This will keep repeating until the portal spawns in a legal 
location. Once the portal is on the map, it acts the same way as the portal we created in 
the last section  (sending the player to one of three random mini-dungeons).
Quibbles
Of course, you’ve probably realized that the preceding logic has a few loopholes. Let’s 
address them.
Problem: There is a minute chance that the portal will spawn 
on top of the player.
Solution: Compare the player’s X and Y to the portal’s 
location. If they are identical, re-randomize the portal’s 
position. (Alternatively, you could move the portal one space 
away from the player, but that could render the portal out of 
bounds, complicating the issue).
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
214
Let’s add the following lines to our Parallel Process event code. These lines go 
immediately after the If: Region = 55 line.
¨Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
¨Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player
  ¨If: X = PortalX
    ¨If: Y = PortalY
      ¨Jump to Label: Repeat
      ¨
    : End
    ¨
  : End
The next line of code after that is the switch toggle for PortalOpen. What we do here 
is make sure that the portal is not on top of the player. If it is, we force the portal’s position 
to re-randomize. Otherwise, we let the event conclude as normal.
Problem: How do we get the portal to re-randomize if the 
player leaves the map and returns later?
Solution: All that really has to be done is switch off 
PortalOpen. Keep track of every way that the player can leave 
the map and then add Control Switches: PortalOpen = 
OFF to each of them. When the player returns to the map, the 
portal will appear once again in a new location.
Handling Random Encounters with Common 
Events
Before moving on to another neat thing to add to your game, let’s expand on what we 
learned concerning the Ancient Spirit’s encounter, to create random encounters using 
common events in the extra dungeon. What we’re going to do is make it so that, when 
an encounter is spawned, the game will pick from a list of enemy troops, instead of 
having a fixed encounter. This is easily done in one of two ways, both related to the Battle 
Processing event command.
	
1.	
Use the Designation with a Variable option, then have a 
variable that rolls a random number. The resulting number 
is then matched to the appropriate troop ID, and the correct 
battle is started.
	
2.	
Use the Same as Random Encounter option. In this case, you 
would set up the possible encounters in the Map Properties 
dialog menu and then limit their appearance to the  
proper Region.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
215
During the course of this section, we will be using the first method. We will need two 
common events, much like before. The first one will be nearly identical to its counterpart 
in Chapter 9. Take a look below.
StepsToEncounter
¨Control Variables: #0010 StepsN = 20
¨Control Variables: #0008 StepsTaken = Steps
¨Script: var n = $gameVariables.value(10);
:       : var x = 18 + Math.randomInt(n) + Math.randomInt(n);
:       : $gameVariables.setValue(9,x); 
¨Control Switches: #0023 BonusDungeon = ON
¨Common Event: DungeonEncounters
¨
It’s pretty much identical to the StepsToAncientSpirit common event, with the sole 
differences being what switch is flipped on and what common event is called. You can use 
a two-line Autorun event on the dungeon map that calls the StepsToEncounter common 
event and then erases itself (via Erase Event) to prevent the game from hanging. The 
encounter event also shares some similarities with the Ancient Spirit’s common event in 
the previous chapter. Take some time to look through it and see what’s new and what’s 
recycled.

For starters, this common event is far longer than the Ancient Spirit equivalent, but 
that is due to the fact that we have to have one conditional branch for each of the regions 
on the map. Because we have four regions, we need four conditional branches to handle 
each of the distinct variable possibilities. Even so, I condense the code as much as I can, 
via the use of Labels. After all, why should I write the same Battle Processing command 
four times in a row when once will suffice? I check the player’s x and y coordinates when 
an encounter is due, to see what region they are in, have the Troop variable roll a random 
number based on the encounters I want the player to face (they are all drawn from the 
main dungeon’s enemy tables, but you could make new enemy troops for this dungeon), 
and then jump to the Battle label to handle the combat itself. Because these are meant to 
be regular encounters, I allow the player to escape. Whether the player wins or escapes 
the battle, the event jumps to the final (otherwise skipped) conditional branch and 
determines how many steps the player will have to take before being attacked once again. 
Afterward, the event jumps back to the top, ready to fire again when ready.

■Tip  You can use the Change Battleback event command to change the battle 
backgrounds of an area, based on the player’s current Region.

Other Cool Things
In this final section of this final chapter, I will be covering several other cool things that 
you can do with what you have already learned during the course of this book.
Another Way to Randomize Chests
Remember when we initially discussed creating chests with random contents? We used 
a variable to roll a random number between one and ten. The player received an item 
based on the number rolled. Here’s another way we can randomize chests to much the 
same effect. The difference, in this case, will be that we can specify the amount of items 
that the player will get as well. It’s not as easy as it may seem, but it’s not that difficult 
either. Your first idea might be to store a random number in a variable and use that within 
one of the Change event commands (Item, Weapon, or Armor). However, see Figure 10-7.
Let’s take Change Items as an example. As you can see, the item to be changed is 
fixed. What can be changed via a variable in the event command is the number of the item 
concerned. So, let’s load up the rpg_objects.js file with Atom and run a search for Change 
Items.. The search should return a single result located in the Game_Interpreter portion of 
the file (Line 9549). Click on the Find button, and you should see the following code: 
// Change Items
Game_Interpreter.prototype.command126 = function() {
    var value = this.operateValue(this._params[1], this._params[2],  
this._params[3]);
    $gameParty.gainItem($dataItems[this._params[0]], value);
    return true;
};
Figure 10-7.  The Change Items event command dialog menu
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
218
For the purposes of this exercise, we need only worry about the second line of this 
function. We can see that $dataItems[this._params[0]] is whichever item we select via 
the Change Items event command. And, we can infer that value is the quantity of that 
particular item to be added or taken away from the player’s inventory. 
So, with that said, if we wanted to have a chest that can give the player one of the first 
14 items in the Database, we could have an event similar to the one below.
¨Control Variables: #0029 ItemRoll = Random 1...14
¨Control Variables: #0030 ItemQuantity = Random 1...5
¨Script: var x = $gameVariables.value(29);
:       : var v = $gameVariables.value(30); 
:       : $gameVariables.setValue(31,$dataItems[x].name);
:       : $gameParty.gainItem($dataItems[x], v);
¨Text: None, Window, Bottom
:     : You have obtained \V[30] \V[31](s) !
In the preceding event code, we use three variables to store relevant information. 
ItemRoll rolls a random number between 1 and 14, to determine which item should be 
given to the player upon opening the chest. Similarly, ItemQuantity determines how 
many copies of that item are given. Then, we use the Script event command to input 
some lines of code. I use variable substitution, to reduce the amount of space each line 
takes (whenever possible, it’s best to have a single expression for a single line). I take 
a line to assign the name of the chosen item to $gameVariables.value(31) and then 
execute $gameParty.gainItem (using x for the item id and v for the quantity). Last, but 
definitely not least, we have to inform the player of what item he/she has obtained  
(and in what quantity). That’s as easy as inserting the values of variables 30 and 31 into a 
Show Text event command. See Figure 10-8 for a sample execution of this code.
Figure 10-8.  The text box and inventory proof that the player has obtained the correct item 
in the correct quantities

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
219
Logically, you can also apply this event code to weapons and armor, by using the 
appropriate parameter within $gameParty.gainItem. That would be $dataWeapons for 
weapons and $dataArmors for armor. However, a cursory look at the $gameParty.gainItem 
method as applied for weapons or armor will reveal an extra parameter. Let’s take the 
Change Weapons script code as an example.
// Change Weapons
Game_Interpreter.prototype.command127 = function() {
    var value = this.operateValue(this._params[1], this._params[2],  
this._params[3]);
    $gameParty.gainItem($dataWeapons[this._params[0]], value,  
this._params[4]);
    return true;
};
After value, we have an extra parameter called this.params[4]. This matches up 
with the Include Equipment check box in both Change Weapons and Change Armors 
and determines whether an equipped item can be taken, or only one that is in the 
player’s inventory. This parameter should only be true if you want to take away a player’s 
equipped weapon or armor (such as if he or she is fighting against a thief). For this 
example (as we’re giving the player weapons/armor), we can always leave it as false.
Day-Night Cycle
While completely unnecessary in a dungeon crawler such as the game we created in the 
first nine chapters of this book, you can apply what you have learned during this chapter 
to add a day-night cycle to the game. There are several levels of complexity when it comes 
to day-night cycles.
• 
Time of day may only be changed by resting in specific locations 
or after certain story events.
• 
As per the previous bullet, but time also passes while on the  
world map.
• 
Additionally, time passes as the character moves, regardless of 
his/her current location.
As a matter of opinion, I think the best version of the day-night cycle is the one that 
only allows time to pass while the player is moving on the world map. We can make it so 
that inns move the clock to daytime or nighttime, to enable time-specific quests as well. 
For this exercise, I will create a pair of common events to handle the day-night cycle logic 
and a pair of torches that set the initial time of day when the player interacts with them. 
The completed result will look like Figure 10-9.

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
220
At its core, a day-night cycle is little more than a Tint Screen effect and a flipped 
switch (to mark the current time of day, as it were). On that note, let’s create our pair of 
torches. Each torch will turn on one of the two cycle switches and toggle off the other. 
Then, the screen will be tinted appropriately for the time of day. That will complete the 
bare minimum required for a day-night cycle. Naturally, I will expand on that a few times 
during this section.

■Tip   The Tint Screen values for daytime are the default numbers you see when 
initializing the Tint Screen event command (also accessible via the Normal button). The Tint 
Screen values for nighttime are the ones you get by clicking the Night button.
Not much to the basics, eh? Of course, you can get far more complicated than that. 
Now, let’s say that you want to make it so that day turns to night (and vice versa) when the 
player has taken a certain number of steps (let’s say 50). This is similar in premise to what 
we did with the Ancient Spirit. Here’s the pair of common events needed to make time 
pass in the aforementioned manner.

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
222
Before you read on, take a moment to add Common Event: Day-Night Cycle Start 
to both of the torch events. Now, let’s discuss what’s happening in those two common 
events. Selecting one of the two torches will start the sequence of events. We save the 
number of steps the player has taken to the StepsTaken variable. Then, we flip on the 
CycleON switch and call the Day-Night Cycle Logic common event. Why do I set the step 
count in the first common event, you may be wondering? It’s pretty simple. If you want 
to count 50 steps, you need a baseline to start from. The easiest method is by using the 
Steps counter that RMMV keeps internally. However, the only time that counter will be at 
0 is when the player has just started a new game. Thus, we have to assign the step value 
to a variable and then modify that accordingly. If we had that variable assignment in the 
second common event, the time of day would never change.
Anyway, once CycleON has been triggered, we store the step value into a second 
variable called StepsToCycle and subtract 50 from that. Because the value of StepsTaken 
is static until otherwise called, this makes it so that there’s a difference of 50 between 
StepsTaken and StepsToCycle. The conditional branch in the following line is executed 
once StepsToCycle is greater than or equal to StepsTaken. Naturally, that will happen in 
exactly 50 steps. There is then a pair of conditional branches that execute based on the 
current time of day. If it is daytime, the screen tint will become Night, the Daytime switch 
will be flipped off, and the Nighttime switch will be flipped on. If it is nighttime, the screen 
tint will become Normal, the Daytime switch will be flipped on, and the Nighttime switch 
will be flipped off. In either case, the CycleON switch will be flipped off, the Day-Night 
Cycle Start common event will be called, and a Jump to Label event command is used to 
prevent both conditional branches from executing in a single iteration. Otherwise, day 
would become night and then day in one single sequence, which is definitely unintended.
■
■Note  You could also have a gradual transition—say, setting four levels of tint  
(maybe 0, -22, -44, and -68) and switching to those as the player’s number of steps hits 
a certain threshold (every 15 steps or so), and then reversing it to change back to day. You 
might even put in some logic to, say, have 100 steps of daylight, then 50 steps of change, 
then 50 steps of nighttime, then 50 steps of change, and so on. You could even have it so 
that each step the character takes in the change period corresponds to a one-step change 
in the tint, so that the character sees a very gradual change in the light as it walks around.
Random Encounters in a Day-Night Cycle
So, now we have a day-night cycle that only requires the Day-Night Cycle Start common 
event to be called to start things off. Let’s add another layer to the complexity by adding 
some random encounters to the map. First of all, we have to paint some Regions onto 
our map. I’m going to add three Regions. See Figure 10-10 for a screenshot of the map’s 
regions.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
223
Next, we have to create another pair of common events to handle the encounter logic 
on this map. The first encounter will serve a similar purpose to Day-Night Cycle Start, 
in that it will initialize the conditions for the second, more substantial, common event to 
work properly.
EncounterCall
¨Control Variables: #0033 CountToEncounter = Steps
¨Control Variables: #0010 StepsN = 20
¨Script: var n = $gameVariables.value(10);
:       : var x = 18 + Math.randomInt(n) + Math.randomInt(n);
:       : $gameVariables.setValue(9,x); 
¨Control Switches: #0027 EncountersON = ON
¨Common Event: CycleEncounters
¨
Figure 10-10.  A screenshot of our day-night cycle map’s regions
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
224
This common event is laid out in much the same way as the StepsToAncientSpirit 
event. Since we already use StepsTaken for the day-night cycle, we have to use an 
alternate variable to hold the steps count for the start of the encounters common event. 
Why? It comes down to several problems that occur if we do not do this.
• 
Each phase of the day-night cycle lasts for 50 steps. The maximum 
possible roll for the encounter timer is 56 steps.
• 
If we were to use StepsTaken, its value would be reset each time 
day becomes night or vice versa. This would interfere with the 
correct processing of the encounter event. In the worst case 
scenario, you might not see a single encounter in an entire phase.
• 
Likewise, the encounter event would interfere with the day-night 
cycle in the same way.
Any way you slice it, this is an instance where not recycling certain variables will be 
for the best. Take a look at the following for the code for the encounter event.
CycleEncounters
Trigger: Parallel
Condition Switch: 0027 EncountersON
¨Control Variables: #0011 StepsTakenOnMap = Steps
¨Control Variables: #0011 StepsTakenOnMap -= CountToEncounter
¨If: StepsTakenOnMap > StepsToEncounter
  ¨Control Variables: #0019 X = Map X of Player
  ¨Control Variables: #0020 Y = Map Y of Player

    ¨Control Variables: #0025 Troop = Random 1...6

  ¨If: Region = 5

  ¨If: Region = 9
    ¨Control Variables: #0025 Troop = Random 20...26

¨If: #0092 is ON
  ¨Label: Resolve
  ¨Control Switches: #0027 EncountersON = OFF
  ¨Common Event: EncounterCall
  ¨
: End
¨
Take some time to compare this event with the DungeonEncounters common event 
we created for the bonus dungeon and note how I streamlined this one to the best of my 
ability. The last thing you will need to do is add Common Event: EncounterCall to both of 
the torch events. With that completed, we can call this section done! I urge you to figure 
out how to generalize the things covered in this section for use in a longer game. It’s a 
great challenge, should you wish to accept it.
Achievements
We’re approaching the end of this final chapter! Now, I’m going to cover achievements. 
In gaming terms, an achievement is a milestone that may or may not reward the player 
for reaching it. During the course of creating the dungeon crawler, we reward the 
player several times for advancing the main plot. However, what if we had a full-blown 
achievement system that detects when certain other milestones have been met? The 
common event below is meant to serve as a template that you can expand however  
you like. Without further ado, here it is:
Achievements
Trigger: Parallel
Switch: 0041 Achievements
¨Control Variables: #0026 BattleCount = Battle Count
¨Control Variables: #0027 PlayerLevel = $gameParty.members()[0].level
¨Control Variables: #0028 TotalGold = Gold
¨If: PlayerLevel > 10
  ¨If: GetLevel10 is OFF

    ¨
  : End
  ¨
: End
¨
■
■Note 
$gameParty.members()[n] brings up the player character that’s in position 
n+1 in the party. Thus, 0 marks the party leader. Given that we have made it so that the 
player cannot switch the position of the main character with that of his/her companion, 0 
will always be either Palnor, Gust, or Feylia. From there, we can get his/her level with the 
expression listed above.
I did not include any actual rewards in these achievements, so feel free to add your 
own. Adding achievements to the game is as easy as flipping on the AchievementsON 
switch. I accomplished this by adding a purple torch containing the necessary code to the 
character select map.

While achievements are disabled, the torch will offer to enable them. When 
achievements are enabled, the torch will offer to disable them. This covers the possibility 
of the player accidentally enabling them. Here are some other achievements you could 
add to the game:
• 
Achievements for killing a certain number of a certain enemy. 
This will require additionally that you increase the value of a 
variable when said enemy is defeated in battle. 
• 
Achievements for number of steps taken
• 
Achievements for clearing optional content
Really, the sky is the limit when it comes to achievements! Feel free to take a look at 
your favorite games and see how players are rewarded in them. We’re just about done 
here, but I have two more sections to cover, both of them newly added features of RMMV. 
The first section covers the Event Searcher.
The Event Searcher
The Event Searcher is a particularly neat new feature of RMMV, and I didn’t want to finish 
this book without at least mentioning it. How does it work? Well, it’s quite simple. You can 
search for a specific switch, variable, or event name, and the Event Searcher will return 
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ What Comes Next
228
the results of all events in your project that contain your search criteria. You can find the 
Event Searcher in the Tools portion of the menubar of RMMV. Let me show it off with a 
screenshot. Take a look at Figure 10-11.
In the preceding figure, I ran a search for the DeepestDungeonFloor variable that 
we used throughout the game to make sure the town greeter was always mentioning 
things immediately relevant to the player’s game progress. Notice how there’s a total of six 
events that reference this variable; one for each of the times that we increment it in our 
game. Also notice my complete lack of specific event naming (by default, events have a 
five character codename of EVXXX, where the three Xs are replaced by the actual event 
number along with leading zeroes to make it a three digit number). It’s a good habit to 
name your events based on what they’re executing, but I tend to only do so when I need 
to know the exact event for the purposes of specific event commands. Case in point, you 
may have picked up on the fact that I named the Portal event I used for the random portal 
event earlier in the chapter. Otherwise, I would’ve needed to figure out its exact event ID, 
which is a bit more tedious than just giving it the name in the first place. 
Now, I’m going to talk about exporting your game to multiple platforms.

Exporting Your Game
Perhaps one of the most positively received changes of RPG Maker MV is the added 
ability to export your game to Mac OS X, iOS, and Android (besides the already existent 
ability to export your game for Windows). This section will cover exporting your game to 
the various platforms. Regardless of what platform you plan to export to, your quest starts 
in the Deployment option located in RMMV’s File Menu. Click on it and then skip to the 
section appropriate to the platform you wish to export to.
For Windows
As the left-most option in the Platform selection menu, Windows is automatically 
selected when you open the Deployment menu. All you need to do is specify the Output 
Location directory path (I changed it from its default to C:\Users\USER\Desktop\
GameOutput\Win) and click on OK. Then, you’ll get a window that displays the 
distribution package creation. Once it’s done, you’ll get a confirmation window that says 
“Succeeded to create a distribution package.” You can run the game if you’re running a 
computer with Windows (or a non-Windows OS with Windows emulation) by finding it in 
the output folder and executing the Game.exe application.
For Mac OS X
In the Platform selection menu, Mac OS X is the middle option. Select it and then specify 
the Output Location directory path (I changed it from its default to C:\Users\USER\
Desktop\GameOutput\Mac) and click on OK. Then, you’ll get a window that displays the 
distribution package creation. Once it’s done, you’ll get a confirmation window that says 
“Succeeded to create a distribution package.” Curiously, you can run this package on any 
Windows PC with a newer browser (such as Mozilla Firefox) by finding it in the output 
folder, opening the Game.app folder all the way to the app.nw folder and executing the 
index.html file. However, and more importantly, Game.app will function as a valid game 
application within Mac OS X.
For Android/iOS
Creating a distribution package for Android or iOS is a highly involved process that is 
only beginning when you use the Deployment option within RMMV. Unlike exporting 
a game project to Windows or Mac OS X, deploying a build for Android or iOS only gets 
you the project’s resources. It is up to you to turn that into an appropriate distribution 
package. Thankfully, you’re not alone. Kadokawa has some robust documentation 
provided within the RMMV help file on how to prepare your game for both Android and 
iOS environments. You can find the relevant information in the Documentation section of 
the Help File under the headings “Converting to an Android App” and “Converting to an 
iOS App”.

Summary
During the course of this chapter, I have covered a variety of miscellaneous niceties that 
can be used to flesh out our dungeon crawler, including, but not limited to, creating a 
random shop, creating a portal that appears at a random location and takes the player 
to a bonus dungeon, and an achievements system. I would like to take a moment to 
congratulate you on making it to the end of this book. You now have a completed game to 
your credit, in addition to several other features that you can use to keep expanding the 
game. I humbly encourage you to continue learning about RMMV and game design in 
general; it is quite a fascinating adventure! You can check out the Appendix to see links to 
helpful sites that will help you in your quest for knowledge. Otherwise, this is the end.  
In that case, I wish you the best of luck, and have fun!

www.rpgmakervxace.net: One of the most populated 
unofficial forums related to RMVXA on the Internet.  
Despite its name and original focus, it also now has a  
section for RMMV, directly accessible via this link:  
http://www.rpgmakervxace.net/forum/146-rpgmaker-mv/  
If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for on the official 
site, this should be your next destination.
http://www.rpgmakermv.co: This is a relatively new site 
that has popped up in response to the release of RPG Maker 
MV. Much like rpgmakerweb, this is a forum community for 
people who work with RMMV.
■
■Note   Search engines will steer you toward rpgmakerweb.com whenever they get 
a chance. Degica (the publishers of RPG Maker worldwide) has done a fairly good job of 
positioning itself as the universal destination for all things RPG Maker (which, given that 
they’re the publishers of the brand, is fair play). You can buy resource packs (music, art, etc.) 
from them, as well as a few other objects of interest.
Art Creation
Following is a pair of links to sites that cover how to create 2D sprites and pixel art. If 
you’re of an artistic bent, this will help you do work in the 2D style of video game art.
http://2dwillneverdie.com/tutorial/: Contains a wide 
variety of tutorials for creating and manipulating 2D sprites. 
Pretty appropriate for a site called 2D Will Never Die.
www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/tsugumo/: 
Contains 11 tutorials for creating pixel art. The information 
within is more than ten years old, but still holds up.
http://www.2dgameartguru.com/: Notable for being the 
first Google result for a search of 2D art creation, this site has 
plenty of cool tutorials for creating 2D game art.
www.it-ebooks.info

Art Databases
On the other hand, perhaps you’re not of an artistic inclination. Or, alternatively, you’d 
rather not spend your time creating art for your game. In that case, following is a pair of 
art databases that could serve your needs.
http://opengameart.org/: A site containing open source 
art, such as sprites and backgrounds. Make sure to check the 
licensing of each particular asset you decide to use in your 
own games, if you intend to go commercial.
http://freegamearts.tuxfamily.org/: As in the case of the 
previous link, this site also promotes the use and development 
of open source game resources.
https://www.gameacademy.com/free-game-art-assets-
resources-for-indie-developers/: Has a list of six art 
resource sites that offer royalty free graphics for independent 
developers.
Sounds and Music
No game is truly complete without an awesome soundtrack. A classic, retro-style game, 
for example, deserves an equally retro soundtrack. Here are some links to sites that host 
chiptune music (a.k.a. the music used in 8-bit games for consoles such as the Nintendo 
Entertainment System or NES).
http://ericskiff.com/music/: Contains a link to a chiptune 
album called Resistor Anthems. The songs in the album are 
released under a Creative Commons Attribution License, so 
they are free to use for whatever purposes you can think of. 
The musician only asks that you notify him, so that he can link 
back to you.
www.proudmusiclibrary.com/en/tag/8-bit/: There are 
exactly 39 8-bit songs hosted on Proud Music. You’ll have to 
pay to license any of the songs from that site that you decide 
to use.
http://pinkuboa.tumblr.com/post/92110744181/see-i-
did-do-something-for-200-followers-12: This particular 
Tumblr post does an awesome job of linking to a bunch of 
music resources that you can use for your own games—
chiptune and otherwise (even going as far as pointing out that 
you shouldn’t “steal music from published games and anime, 
use all this free stuff here instead!”). As usual, make sure to 
verify the licensing of a specific file before using it!
www.it-ebooks.info

Appendix A ■ Useful Resources for 2D Game Creation 
234
And, here’s one non-chiptune music site that I couldn’t go without mentioning, 
as I have personally commissioned songs from this particular composer and definitely 
recommend him.
http://www.scythuzmusic.com/: The site of Benjamin Carr 
aka. Scythuz. He has composed many tracks already and is 
always open to trying something new. Check him out if you 
have a need for music that isn’t chiptune.
Fonts
Having a unique font can set your game apart. The Internet hosts many font marketplaces 
and sites, but following is one link in particular that caught my eye.
www.1001fonts.com/retro+video-game-fonts.
html?page=1&items=10: Contains 31 retro fonts. All of 
them are free for personal use, but only some are free for 
commercial use. Make sure you verify the usage rights for a 
specific font, if you wish to use them for commercial purposes.
Other Game Engines
RPG Maker MV is hardly the only game-development engine on the market that can 
make 2D games. Here are three others:
Unity: http://unity3d.com/unity/download—As the site link 
essentially states, Unity is a 3D game development engine. 
However, you can also make 2D games with it (see the next 
link), hence the reason I mention it here.
Unity 2D Tutorials: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/
modules/beginner/2d—Tutorials for 2D game development 
within the Unity engine are offered via that link.
Construct 2: www.scirra.com/construct2—Construct 2 uses 
HTML 5 as its language of choice for the creation of 2D games.
GameMaker: Studio: www.yoyogames.com/studio—
GameMaker has been around for quite a while and, much like 
RPG Maker MV, can be used to make 2D games with only a 
minimum of programming experience.

Closing Notes
At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what game-development engine you use. While 
some engines lend themselves better to certain types of games (much like RMMV 
works like a charm for 2D RPGs), the most important part of making a game is actually 
designing it. The easiest game concept in the world is impossible to make for those who 
don’t even bother trying! Take the knowledge you have gained from making this dungeon 
crawler and set forth. I wish you luck in all of your future endeavors!
