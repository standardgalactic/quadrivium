s Yogi Berra would say, “It was déjà vu all over again”: front-page treat-
ment, top billing on network TV and cable, and diehards lining up for 
days in advance to ensure landing a highly lusted-after product from Apple. 
The products generating the remarkable buzz this time around is the iPad 
Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Every iPad is a magical device. We hope you bought 
this book to find out how to get the most magic out of yours. Our goal is to 
deliver that information in a light and breezy fashion. We expect you to have 
fun using your iPad mini. We equally hope that you have fun spending time 
with us.
About This Book
We need to get one thing out of the way right from the get-go. We think you’re 
pretty darn smart for buying a For Dummies book. That says to us that you 
have the confidence and intelligence to know what you don’t know. The For 
Dummies franchise is built around the core notion that everyone feels inse-
cure about certain topics when tackling them for the first time, especially 
when those topics have to do with technology.
As with most Apple products, iPad minis are beautifully designed and intui-
tive to use. And though our editors may not want us to reveal this dirty little 
secret (especially on the first page, for goodness’ sake), the truth is you’ll get 
pretty far just by exploring the iPad’s many functions and features on your 
own, without the help of this (or any other) book.
Okay, now that we’ve spilled the beans, we’ll tell you why you shouldn’t run 
back to the bookstore and request a refund. This book is chock-full of useful 
tips, advice, and other nuggets that should make your iPad experience all the 
more pleasurable. We’ll even go so far as to say that you won’t find some of 
these nuggets anywhere else. So keep this book nearby and consult it often.
Foolish Assumptions
Although we know what happens when you make assumptions, we’ve made 
a few anyway. First, we assume that you, gentle reader, know nothing about 
using an iPad or iOS — beyond knowing what an iPad is, that you want to use 

2
iPad mini For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
iOS, that you want to understand your iPad mini and its operating system 
without digesting an incomprehensible technical manual, and that you made 
the right choice by selecting this particular book.
And so, we do our best to explain each new concept in full and loving detail. 
Perhaps that’s foolish, but . . . oh, well.
One last thing: We also assume that you can read. If you can’t, please ignore 
this paragraph.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (or icons) appear in the left margins throughout this 
book. Consider these icons as miniature road signs, telling you something 
extra about the topic at hand or hammering a point home. Here’s what the 
five icons used in this book look like and mean.
	
These juicy morsels, shortcuts, and recommendations might make the task at 
hand faster or easier.
	
This icon emphasizes the stuff we think you ought to retain. You may even jot 
down a note to yourself in the iPad.
	
Put on your propeller beanie hat and insert your pocket protector; this text 
includes the truly geeky stuff. You can safely ignore this material, but if it 
weren’t interesting or informative, we wouldn’t have bothered to write it.
	
You wouldn’t intentionally run a stop sign, would you? In the same fashion, 
ignoring warnings may be hazardous to your iPad and (by extension) your 
wallet. There, you now know how these warning icons work, for you have just 
received your very first warning!
	
We put a New icon next to anything that’s new or improved in iOS 8 or with 
the iPad mini.
Beyond the Book
We wrote a bunch of things that just didn’t fit in the print version of this 
book. Rather than leave them on the cutting room floor, we’ve posted the 
most useful bits online for your enjoyment and edification.

Where to Go from Here
Why, go straight to Chapter 1, of course (without passing Go).
In all seriousness, we wrote this book for you, so please let us know what 
you think. If we screwed up, confused you, left out something, or — heaven 
forbid — made you angry, drop us a note. And if we hit you with one pun too 
many, it helps to know that as well. Because writers are people too (believe 
it or not), we also encourage positive feedback if you think it’s warranted. So 
kindly send email to Ed at Baigdummies@gmail.com and to Bob at iPadLeVitus@
boblevitus.com. We do our best to respond to reasonably polite email in a timely 
fashion. Most of all, we want to thank you for buying our book. Please enjoy it 
along with your new iPad mini.
Note: At the time we wrote this book, all the information it contained was 
accurate for all Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + 3G and 4G iPad mini models. The book is 
also based on version 8.1 of the iOS (operating system) and version 12.0.1 
of iTunes. Apple is likely to introduce new iPad models and new versions of 
iOS and iTunes between book editions, so if the hardware or user interface 
on your new iPad or the version of iTunes on your computer looks a little 
different, be sure to check out what Apple has to say at www.apple.com/
ipad. You’ll no doubt find updates on the company’s latest releases. When 
a change is substantial, we try to add an update or additional information at 
www.dummies.com/extras/ipad.

ongratulations! You’ve selected one of the most incredible handheld 
devices we’ve ever seen. Of course, the iPad mini is a combination of a 
killer audio and video iPod, an e-book reader, a powerful Internet communica-
tions device, a superb handheld gaming device, a still and video camera, and 
a platform for over 1.2 million apps at the time this was written — and prob-
ably a lot more by the time you read this.
	
Apple has produced three iPad mini models so far: The original iPad 
mini (Fall 2012), the iPad mini with Retina display (Fall 2013), 
and the iPad mini 3 (Fall 2014). If a distinction between 
models is necessary, we refer to them as iPad mini 1, 2, 
and 3.
In this chapter, we offer a gentle introduction to 
all the pieces that make up your iPad, plus over-
views of its revolutionary hardware and software 
features.
Exploring the iPad’s Big Picture
The iPad has many best-of-class features, but perhaps 
its most notable feature is its lack of a physical keyboard 
or stylus. Instead, it has a super-high-resolution touchscreen 
that you operate using a pointing device you’re already inti-
mately familiar with: your finger.

8
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
And what a display it is. Every iPad mini ever built has a beautiful screen, but 
the iPad mini 2 and 3 sport Apple’s exclusive high-definition Retina display, 
which is easily the most beautiful screen we’ve ever seen on a tablet.
Other things we love include the iPad mini’s plethora of built-in sensors. It 
has an accelerometer to detect when you rotate the device from portrait to 
landscape mode — and instantly adjust what’s on the display accordingly.
	
The screen rotates — that is, unless the screen orientation lock is engaged. 
We tell you more about this feature shortly.
A light sensor adjusts the display’s brightness in response to the current 
ambient lighting conditions.
In addition to the aforementioned sensors, iPad minis have a three-axis gyro 
sensor that works with the accelerometer and built-in compass.
The latest model, the iPad mini 3, is the first iPad mini to include Apple’s 
Touch ID sensor, which lets you unlock your iPad with your fingerprint.
Last, but definitely not least, all iPad minis come with Siri, a voice-controlled 
personal assistant happy to do almost anything you ask (as long as your iPad 
is running iOS 6 or later).
In the following sections, we’re not just marveling about the wonderful 
screen and sensors. Now it’s time to take a brief look at the rest of the iPad 
mini’s features, broken down by product category.
The iPad mini as an iPod
We agree with the late Steve Jobs on this one: The iPad is magical — and 
without a doubt the best iPod Apple has ever produced. You can enjoy all 
your existing iPod content — music, audiobooks, audio and video podcasts, 
iTunes U courses, music videos, television shows, and movies — on the gor-
geous color display found on every iPad ever made (even the oldest iPads 
have gorgeous color displays).
	
Here’s the bottom line: If you can get the content — be it video, audio, or 
whatever — into iTunes on your Mac or PC, you can synchronize it and watch 
or listen to it on your iPad. And, of course, you can always buy or rent con-
tent on your iPad in the iTunes Store.
Chapter 3 is all about syncing (transferring media from your computer to 
your iPad), but for now, just know that some video content may need to be 
converted to an iPad-compatible format, with the proper resolution, frame 
rate, bit rate, and file format to play on your iPad. If you try to sync an incom-
patible video file, iTunes alerts you that an issue exists.

9
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
	
If you get an error message about an incompatible video file, select the file in 
iTunes and choose File➪Create New Version. When the conversion is fin-
ished, sync again. Chapter 8 covers video and video compatibility in more 
detail.
And here’s another tip at no extra cost: The free HandBrake app (http://
handbrake.fr) often provides better results than iTunes when converting 
movie files to an iPad-friendly format. It has presets for most iPad models, so 
it’s simple to use, and it can often convert movie files and formats that iTunes 
chokes on.
The iPad mini as an Internet communications device
But wait — there’s more! Not only is the iPad mini a stellar iPod, but it’s also 
a full-featured Internet communications device with — we’re about to drop 
some industry jargon on you — a rich HTML email client that’s compatible 
with most POP and IMAP mail services, with support for Microsoft Exchange 
ActiveSync. (For more on this topic, see Chapter 5.) Also onboard is a world-
class web browser (Safari) that makes web surfing fun and easy on the eyes, 
unlike what’s on many mobile devices. Chapter 4 explains how to surf the 
web using Safari.
Another cool Internet feature is Maps, a killer mapping app that’s improved in 
iOS 8. By using GPS (3G or 4G models) or triangulation (Wi-Fi–only models), 
the iPad can determine your location, let you view maps and satellite ­imagery, 
and obtain driving directions and traffic information regardless of where 
you happen to be. (See Chapter 6 for the scoop on Maps.) You can also find 
businesses, such as gas stations, pizza restaurants, hospitals, and Apple 
Stores, with just a few taps.
We daresay that the Internet experience on an iPad is far superior to the 
Internet experience on any other handheld device.
The iPad mini as an e-book reader
Download the free iBooks app if you don’t already have it, or any of the 
excellent (and free) third-party e-book readers such as the Kindle and Nook 
apps, and you’ll discover a whole new way of finding and reading books. The 
iBooks Store and Newsstand app (covered in Chapter 10) are chock-full of 
good reading at prices that are lower than what you’d pay for a printed copy. 
Better still, when you read an e-book, you’re helping the environment and 
saving trees. Furthermore, some (if not many) titles include audio, video, or 
graphical content not available in the printed editions. Plus, a great number 
of good books are free. And best of all, you can carry your entire library in 
one hand. If you’ve never read a book on your iPad mini, give it a try. We 
think you’ll like (or love) it.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
The iPad mini as a multimedia powerhouse
The spectacular screen found on the iPad mini 1 is superb for personal video 
viewing, but the Retina display on the second- and third-generation iPad 
minis make the experience even more extraordinary. Add an adapter cable or 
Apple TV, as discussed in Chapter 17, and your iPad mini turns into a superb 
device for watching video on an HDTV (or even a non-HD TV), with support 
for output resolutions up to 1080p.
	
You won’t need the (admittedly less expensive) adapter cable if you choose 
an Apple TV ($99), which is a marvelous little device that, among other 
things, lets you stream audio and video to your HDTV wirelessly.
And iPads include a pair of cameras and the FaceTime video-chatting app, 
taking the iPad’s multimedia acumen to new heights. Chapter 8 gets you 
started with FaceTime.
The iPad mini as a platform for third-party apps
At the time of this writing, more than 1.2 million apps were available in the 
App Store, with over 75 billion downloads to date in categories such as 
games, business, education, entertainment, healthcare and fitness, music, 
photography, productivity, travel, and sports. The cool thing is that most of 
them, even ones designed for the iPhone or iPod touch, also run flawlessly on 
the iPad mini.
Of those million+ apps, more than half are designed for the iPad’s larger 
screen, with more arriving daily.
Chapter 11 helps you fill your iPad mini with all the cool apps your heart 
desires. We share our favorite free and for-pay apps in Chapters 18 and 19, 
respectively.
What do you need to use an iPad mini?
To use your iPad mini, only a few simple things are required. Here’s a list of 
everything you need:
	
✓	An iPad mini
	
✓	An Apple ID (assuming that you want to acquire content such as apps, 
videos, music, iBooks, and podcasts, which you almost certainly do)
	
✓	Internet access — broadband wireless Internet access is recommended
In previous editions of this book, we said you needed a computer with iTunes 
to sync your iPad. That’s no longer true; you can activate, set up, update, 
back up, and restore an iPad wirelessly without a computer.

11
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
Although you don’t technically need a computer, it’s nice to have a symbiotic 
relationship between your iPad and your Mac or PC, because many common 
tasks are faster and easier using a computer with iTunes than they are on 
your iPad. If you decide to introduce your iPad to your computer (and we 
think you should), you need one of the following for syncing (which we dis-
cuss at length in Chapter 3):
	
✓	A Mac with a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 or later, and 
iTunes 11.1 or later
	
✓	A PC with a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port; Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows 
Vista; and iTunes 11.1 or later
iTunes is a free download, available at www.itunes.com/download.
Touring the iPad mini Exterior
The iPad mini is a harmonious combination of hardware and software. In 
the following sections, we take a brief look at the hardware — what’s on the 
outside.
On the top
On the top of your iPad mini, you find the headphone jack, microphone, and 
the sleep/wake button, as shown in Figure 1-1:
	
✓	Sleep/wake button: This button is used to put your iPad mini’s screen to 
sleep or to wake it up. It’s also how you turn your iPad on or off. To put 
it to sleep or wake it up, just press the button. To turn it on or off, press 
and hold down the button for a few seconds.
	
	Your iPad mini’s battery will run down faster when your iPad is awake, 
so we suggest that you make a habit of putting it to sleep when you’re 
not using it.
	
	When your iPad is sleeping, nothing happens if you touch its screen. To 
wake it up, merely press the button again or press the Home button on 
the front of the device (as described in a moment).
	
	If you use an Apple smart cover or smart case (or any of the third-party 
cases that use the smart cover mechanism), you can just open the cover 
to wake your iPad and close the cover to put it to sleep.
	
	In Chapter 15, you can find out how to make your iPad go to sleep auto-
matically after a period of inactivity.

12
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
✓	Headphone jack: This jack lets you plug in a headset. You can use the 
Apple headsets or headphones that came with your iPhone or iPod. Or 
you can use pretty much any headphones or headset that plugs into a 
3.5-mm stereo headphone jack.
	
	Throughout this book, we use the words headphones, earphones, and 
headset interchangeably. Strictly speaking, a headset includes a micro-
phone so that you can talk (or record) as well as listen; headphones or 
earphones are for listening only. Either type works with your iPad.
	
✓	Microphone: The tiny dot in the middle of the top is actually a pretty 
good microphone.
Figure 1-1: The top of the iPad mini.
On the bottom
On the bottom of your iPad mini are the speaker and Lightning connector, as 
shown in Figure 1-2:
	
✓	Speaker: The speaker plays monaural (single-speaker) audio — music or 
video soundtracks — if no headset is plugged in.
Figure 1-2: The bottom of the iPad mini.
	
✓	Lightning connector: This connector has three purposes:
	
•	Recharge your iPad mini’s battery: Simply connect one end of the 
included Lightning-connector–to–USB cable to the Lightning con-
nector on your mini and the other end to the USB power adapter.
	
•	Synchronize your iPad mini: Connect one end of the same cable to 
your mini’s Lightning connector and the other end to a USB port 
on your Mac or PC.
	
•	Connect your iPad mini to cameras or televisions using adapters: 
Such connectors include the camera connection kit or the other 
adapter cables discussed in Chapter 17. Make sure to use an 
adapter that is appropriate for your Lightning connector.

13
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
	
	If you connect the USB cable to USB ports on your keyboard, USB hub, 
display, or other external device, or even the USB ports on an older Mac 
or PC, you may be able to sync, but more than likely you can’t charge 
the battery. For the most part, only your computer’s built-in USB ports 
(and only recent-vintage computers at that) have enough juice to 
recharge the battery. If you use an external USB port, you probably see a 
Not Charging message next to the battery icon at the top of the screen.
On the right side
On the right side of your iPad mini are the volume up and volume down but-
tons and the ring/silent switch, as shown in Figure 1-3:
	
✓	Ring/silent switch: When the switch is set to silent mode — the down 
position, with an orange dot visible on the switch — your iPad mini 
doesn’t make any sound when you receive new mail or an alert pops up 
on the screen. Note that the ring/silent switch doesn’t silence what we 
think of as expected sounds, which are sounds you expect to hear in a 
particular app. Therefore, it doesn’t silence the iTunes or Videos apps, 
nor does it mute games and other apps that emit noises. About the 
only thing the ring/silent switch mutes are unexpected sounds, such 
as those associated with notifications from apps or the iPad operating 
system (iOS).
	
	
	If the switch doesn’t mute your notification sounds when engaged (that 
is, you can see the little orange dot on the switch), look for a little screen 
orientation icon (shown in the margin) to the left of the battery icon 
near the top of your screen.
	
	When you flick the ring/silent switch, if you see this icon, it means you’ve 
selected the Lock Rotation option in the Settings app’s General pane.
	
✓	Volume up and volume down buttons: These buttons are just below the 
ring/silent switch. Press the upper button to increase the volume; press 
the lower button to decreases the volume.
	
	The Camera app uses the volume up button as an alternative shutter 
release button to the on-screen shutter release button. Press either one 
to shoot a picture or start and stop video recording.
Figure 1-3: The right side has two buttons.

14
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
On the front and back
On the front and back of your iPad mini, you find the following (labeled in 
Figure 1-4):
	
✓	Touchscreen: You find out how to use the iPad’s gorgeous high-resolution 
color touchscreen in Chapter 2. All we have to say at this time is: Try not 
to drool all over it.
	
✓	Home button (all models)/Touch ID sensor (iPad mini 3 only): No 
matter what you’re doing, you can press the Home button at any time 
to display the Home screen, as shown in Figure 1-4. If you have an iPad 
mini 3, your Home button doubles as a Touch ID sensor, and you can use 
your fingerprint (or a passcode) to unlock your phone and authenticate 
purchases.
	
✓	Front camera: The front camera is serviceable and delivers decent-
enough video for video chats and such, but it’s not particularly good for 
taking still photos.
	
✓	App icons: Each of the 20 icons shown on the screen (see Figure 1-4) 
launches an included iPad app. You read more about these apps later in 
this chapter and throughout the rest of the book.
	
✓	Rear camera: iPads have a better camera (than the one in front) on the 
backside, just below the sleep/wake button. All iPad mini models have 
rear cameras that shoot tasty HD video at 1080p and also capture very 
nice stills.
Status bar
The status bar, which is at the top of the screen, displays tiny icons that pro-
vide a variety of information about the current state of your iPad mini:
	
	
✓	Airplane mode: Airplane mode should be enabled when you fly. It 
turns off all wireless features of your iPad — the cellular, 4G, 3G, GPRS 
(General Packet Radio Service), and EDGE (Enhanced Datarate for GSM 
Evolution) networks; Wi-Fi; and Bluetooth — so you can enjoy music, 
video, games, photos, or any app that doesn’t require an Internet con-
nection while you’re in the air.
	
	Tap the Settings app and then tap the Airplane Mode switch on (so green 
is displayed). The icon shown in the margin appears on the left side of 
your status bar whenever airplane mode is enabled.
	
	Disable airplane mode when the plane is at the gate before takeoff or 
after landing so you can send or receive email and iMessages.
	
	There’s no need to enable airplane mode on flights that offer onboard 
Wi-Fi. On such flights it’s perfectly safe to use your iPad’s Wi-Fi while 
you’re in the air (but not until the captain says so).

 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
Figure 1-4: The front and back of the iPad mini: a study in elegant simplicity.
	
	
✓	LTE (Wi-Fi + 4G models only): This icon lets you know that your carrier’s 4G 
LTE network is available and your iPad can use it to connect to the Internet.
	
	
✓	3G (Wi-Fi + 3G models only): This icon informs you that the high-speed 
3G data network from your wireless carrier (that’s AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, 
and T-Mobile in the United States) is available and that your iPad can 
connect to the Internet via 3G. (Wondering what 3G, 4G, and these other 
data networks are? Check out the nearby sidebar, “Comparing Wi-Fi, 4G, 
LTE, 3G, GPRS, and EDGE.”)
	
	
✓	GPRS (Wi-Fi + 3G and 4G models only): This icon says that your wireless 
carrier’s GPRS data network is available and that your iPad can use it to 
connect to the Internet.
	
	
✓	EDGE (Wi-Fi + 3G and 4G models only): This icon tells you that your 
wireless carrier’s EDGE network is available and you can use it to con-
nect to the Internet.

16
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
	
✓	Wi-Fi: If you see the Wi-Fi icon, your iPad is connected to the Internet 
over a Wi-Fi network. The more semicircular lines you see (up to three), 
the stronger the Wi-Fi signal. If your iPad has only one or two semicircles 
of Wi-Fi strength, try moving around a bit. If you don’t see the Wi-Fi icon 
on the status bar, Internet access with Wi-Fi is not currently available.
	
	
✓	Personal hotspot: You see this icon when you’re sharing your Internet 
connection with computers or other devices over Wi-Fi. Personal 
hotspot is available for every iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular model though it 
may not be available in all areas or from all carriers. Additional fees may 
apply. Contact your wireless carrier for more information.
	
	
✓	Syncing: This icon appears on the status bar when your iPad is syncing 
with iTunes on your Mac or PC.
	
	
✓	Activity: This icon tells you that some network or other activity is occur-
ring, such as over-the-air synchronization, the sending or receiving of 
email, or the loading of a web page. Some third-party apps use this icon 
to indicate network or other activity.
	
	
✓	VPN: This icon shows that you’re currently connected to a virtual private 
network (VPN).
	
	
✓	Lock: This icon tells you when your iPad is locked. See Chapter 2 for 
information on locking and unlocking your iPad.
	
	
✓	Screen orientation lock: This icon appears when the screen orientation 
lock is engaged.
	
	
✓	Location Services: This icon appears when an app (such as Maps; see 
Chapter 6 for more about the Maps app) is using Location Services 
(GPS) to establish your physical location (or at least to establish the 
physical location of your iPad).
	
	
✓	Do Not Disturb: This icon appears whenever Do Not Disturb is enabled, 
silencing incoming FaceTime calls and alerts. See Chapter 15 for details 
on Do Not Disturb.
	
	
✓	Play: This icon informs you that a song is currently playing. You find out 
more about playing songs in Chapter 7.
	
	
✓	Bluetooth: This icon indicates the current state of your iPad’s Bluetooth 
connection. If you see this icon on the status bar, Bluetooth is on, and a 
device (such as a wireless headset or keyboard) is connected. If the icon 
is gray, Bluetooth is turned on, but no device is connected. If the icon is 
white, Bluetooth is on, and one (or more) devices are connected. If you 
don’t see a Bluetooth icon, Bluetooth is turned off. Chapter 15 goes into 
more detail about Bluetooth.
	
	
✓	Battery: This icon shows the level of your battery’s charge, and also 
indicates when you’re connected to a power source. It’s completely 
filled when you aren’t connected to a power source and your battery is 
fully charged (as shown in the margin). It then empties as your battery 
becomes depleted. You see an on-screen message when the charge drops 
to 20 percent or below, and another when it reaches 10 percent.

 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
Discovering the Delectable Home 
Screen and Dock Icons
The iPad Home screen and dock display 20 icons, with each icon representing 
a different built-in app or function. Because the rest of the book covers each 
and every one of these babies in full and loving detail, we merely provide 
brief descriptions here.
To get to your Home screen, tap the Home button. If your iPad is asleep when 
you tap, the unlock screen appears. After your iPad is unlocked, you see 
whichever page was on the screen when it went to sleep. If that happens to 
have been the Home screen, you’re golden. If it wasn’t, merely tap the Home 
button again to summon your iPad’s Home screen.
In the following sections, we tell you briefly about the icons preloaded on 
your iPad’s first Home screen page, as well as the icons you find on the dock 
that are always accessible from each Home screen.
Home is where the screen is
If you haven’t rearranged your icons, you see the following apps on your 
Home screen, starting at the top left:
Comparing Wi-Fi, 4G, LTE, 3G, GPRS, and EDGE
Wireless (that is, cellular) carriers may offer 
one of three data networks relevant to the iPad 
as of this writing. For now anyway, all three 
generations of iPad minis can take advantage 
of the speediest 4G or LTE networks, which 
carriers are rolling out as fast as they can. The 
second-fastest network is called 3G, and there 
are older, even slower data networks called 
EDGE and GPRS. Your iPad starts by trying to 
connect to the fastest network it supports. If it 
makes a connection, you see the 4G or 3G icon 
on the status bar. If it can’t connect to a 4G or 
3G network, it tries to connect to a slower EDGE 
or GPRS network, and you see EDGE or GPRS 
icons on the status bar.
Most Wi-Fi networks, however, are faster than 
even the fastest 4G cellular data network — 
and much faster than 3G, EDGE, or GPRS. 
So, because all iPads can connect to a Wi-Fi 
network if one is available, they do so, even 
when a 4G, 3G, GPRS, or EDGE network is also 
available.
Last but not least, if you don’t see one of these 
icons — 4G, 3G, GPRS, EDGE, or Wi-Fi — you 
don’t currently have Internet access. Chapter 4 
offers more details about these different 
networks.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
✓	FaceTime: Use this app to participate in FaceTime video chats, as you 
discover in Chapter 8.
	
✓	Calendar: No matter what calendar program you prefer on your Mac 
or PC (as long as it’s iCal, Calendar, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft 
Outlook or online calendars such as Google or iCloud), you can synchro-
nize events and alerts between your computer and your iPad. Create an 
event on one device, and the event is automatically synchronized with 
the other device the next time the two devices are connected. Neat stuff.
	
✓	Photos: This app is the iPad’s terrific photo manager, which just keeps 
getting better. It lets you view pictures from a camera or SD card (using 
the optional camera connection kit), screen shots of your iPad screen, 
photos synced from your computer, saved from an email or web page, 
or saved from one of the myriad third-party apps that let you save your 
handiwork in the Photos app. You can zoom in or out, create slideshows, 
email photos to friends, crop, do a bit of image editing, and much more. 
And it’s where you’ll find the camera roll, with photos and videos you’ve 
taken with your iPad. To get started, see Chapter 9.
	
✓	Camera: You use this app to shoot pictures or videos with your iPad’s 
front- or rear-facing camera. You find out more in Chapters 8 (videos) 
and 9 (camera).
	
✓	Contacts: This handy little app contains information about the people 
you know. Like the Calendar app, it synchronizes with the Contacts app 
on your Mac or PC (as long as you keep your contacts in Address Book, 
Contacts, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft Outlook), and you can syn-
chronize contacts between your computer and your iPad. If you create 
a contact on one device, the contact is automatically synchronized with 
the other device the next time your devices are connected. Chapter 12 
explains how to start using the Calendar and Contacts apps.
	
✓	Clock: The Clock app includes alarm clocks, timers, and more. You hear 
more about this nifty app in Chapter 13.
	
✓	Maps: This app is among our favorites. View street maps or satellite 
imagery of locations around the globe, or ask for directions, traffic con-
ditions, or even the location of a nearby pizza joint. You can find your 
way around the Maps app with the tips you find in Chapter 6.
	
✓	Videos: This handy app is the repository for your movies, TV shows, 
and music videos. You add videos via iTunes on your Mac or PC or by 
purchasing them from the iTunes Store with the iTunes app on your 
iPad. Check out Chapter 8 to find out more.
	
✓	Notes: This program enables you to type notes while you’re out and 
about. You can send the notes to yourself or to anyone else through 
email, or you can just save them on your iPad until you need them. For 
help as you start using Notes, flip to Chapter 13.

 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPad mini
	
✓	Reminders: This app may be the only to-do list you ever need. It inte-
grates with iCal, Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud, so to-do items and 
reminders sync automatically with your other devices, both mobile and 
desktop. You’ll hear much more about this great app, but you have to 
wait until Chapter 13.
	
✓	Photo Booth: This one is a lot like those old-time photo booths, but you 
don’t have to feed it money. You discover details about Photo Booth in 
Chapter 9.
	
✓	Game Center: This app is the Apple social networking app for game 
enthusiasts. Compare achievements, boast of your conquests and high 
scores, or challenge your friends to battle. You hear more about social 
networking and Game Center in Chapter 13.
	
✓	Newsstand: This app is where you find iPad editions for magazines and 
newspapers to which you subscribe. Shop for subscriptions at the App 
Store. You read more about Newsstand in Chapter 10.
	
✓	iTunes Store: Tap this puppy to purchase music, movies, TV shows, 
audiobooks, and more. You find more info about iTunes (and the Music 
app) in Chapter 7.
	
✓	App Store: This icon enables you to connect to and search the iTunes 
App Store for iPad apps that you can purchase or download for free over 
a Wi-Fi or cellular data network connection. Chapter 11 is your guide to 
buying and using apps from the App Store.
	
✓	iBooks: If you wanted iBooks under iOS 7, you had to download it (it’s 
free). iOS 8 corrected this shortcoming, so if you’re running the latest 
and greatest version of iOS, you have it already. You use iBooks to read 
books, which you can buy in the iTunes Store.
	
✓	Settings: Tap this icon to change settings for your iPad and its apps. 
With so many settings in the Settings app, you’ll be happy to hear that 
Chapter 15 is dedicated exclusively to Settings.
	
✓	Extras: Tap this folder to see its contents:
	
•	Tips: This app offers tips from Apple on doing more with your 
iPad. And here’s a tip about Tips: Apple pushes new tips to the app 
every week, so if you haven’t looked at the app lately, consider 
doing so to see what’s new.
	
•	Podcasts: Use the Podcasts app to (d’oh!) listen to your favorite 
podcasts, which you download and subscribe to (let’s all say it 
together this time) in the iTunes Store.
Sittin’ on the dock of the iPad mini
At the bottom of the iPad mini screen are the final four icons, sitting on a 
­special shelflike area called the dock.

20
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
The thing that makes the icons on your dock special is that they’re available 
on every Home screen page.
By default, the dock icons are
	
✓	Messages: This app provides to iPads, iPhones, iPod touches, and Macs 
a unified messaging service dubbed iMessage. You can exchange unlim-
ited free text or multimedia messages with any other device running 
iOS 5 or later (the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) or Mac OS X Mountain 
Lion or later. Find out more about iMessage in Chapter 5.
	
✓	Mail: This app lets you send and receive email with most POP3 and IMAP 
email systems and, if you work for a company that grants permission, 
Microsoft Exchange, too. Chapter 5 helps you start emailing everyone 
you know from your iPad.
	
✓	Safari: Safari is your web browser. If you’re a Mac user, you know that 
already. If you’re a Windows user who hasn’t already discovered the 
wonderful Safari for Windows, think Internet Explorer on steroids. 
Chapter 4 shows you how to start using Safari on your iPad.
	
✓	Music: Last but not least, this icon unleashes all the power of an iPod 
right on your iPad so that you can listen to music or podcasts. You dis-
cover how the Music app works in Chapter 7.
	
The dock can hold up to six icons. Feel free to add icons to or remove icons 
from the dock until it feels right to you. Press and hold down on an icon until 
all the icons wiggle. Then drag the icon to where you want it. Press the Home 
button to save your arrangement.
Two last points:
	
✓	iOS 5 introduced the totally useful Notification Center, which became 
better and better with each new version of iOS. We wanted to mention 
it even though it doesn’t have an icon of its own. You hear much more 
about it in Chapter 13; to see it now (we know you can’t wait), swipe 
your iPad screen from top to bottom to make it appear. Then swipe from 
bottom to top to put it away again.
	
✓	We’d be remiss not to mention the even more useful Control Center, with 
controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, audio playback, and more, all available from 
any screen in any app. You discover much more about Control Center in 
Chapter 14, but if you just can’t stand the suspense, put your finger at 
the very bottom of your iPad mini screen and swipe upward to check out 
Control Center (and then swipe downward or tap the Home button to put 
it away).

y now you know that the iPad mini you hold in your hands is very 
different from other computers.
You also know that these slate-style machines are rewrit-
ing the rule book for mainstream computing. How so? 
For starters, iPad minis don’t come with a mouse or 
any other kind of pointing device. They lack tradi-
tional computing ports or connectors, such as USB. 
And they have no physical or built-in keyboard.
iPads even differ from other so-called tablet PCs, 
some of which feature a pen or stylus and let you 
write in digital ink. As we point out (pun intended) 
in Chapter 1, the iPad relies on an input device that 
you always have with you: your finger.
Tablet computers of one form or another have actually 
been around since the last century. They just never captured 
the fancy of Main Street. Apple’s very own Newton, an ill-fated 
1990s personal digital assistant, was among the machines that barely 
made a dent in the market.
What’s past is past, of course, and technology — not to mention Apple 
itself — has come a long way since Newton. And suffice it to say that in the 
future, tablets — led by the iPad brigade, of course — promise to enjoy a 

22
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
much rosier outlook. Indeed, since the iPad burst onto the scene, numerous 
tech titans (as well as smaller companies) have introduced their own smaller 
display touch-enabled tablets; many rely on the Google Android mobile oper-
ating system, some on versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, 
and a few on other operating systems. Some solid machines are among them, 
but the iPad remains the market leader and a true pioneer in the space.
If you own one of the mini’s closest relatives, an iPhone or iPod touch, you 
already have a gigantic start in figuring out how to master the iPad multi-
touch method of navigating the interface with your fingers. If you’ve been 
using iOS 8 on those devices, you have an even bigger head start. You have 
our permission to skim the rest of this chapter, but we urge you to stick 
around anyway because some things on the mini work in subtly different 
ways than on the iPhone or iPod touch. If you’re a total novice, don’t fret. 
Nothing about multitouch is painful.
Getting Started on Getting Started
You don’t need a computer to use your iPad mini, but we think you’ll prefer 
using your mini with one rather than without one.
	
In our experience, many tasks — such as iOS software updates and rearrang-
ing app icons — are faster and easier to do using iTunes on a Mac or PC than 
on the iPad.
Now, here are those four things you need to use your iPad:
	
✓	A computer: As we point out, you don’t need a computer, though it’s 
helpful to use your iPad with one just the same. The computer can 
be a Macintosh running Mac OS X version 10.5.8 or later, or a PC run-
ning Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP Home or 
Professional Edition with Service Pack 3 or later.
	
	The iCloud service has higher requirements: Mac OS X Mountain Lion, 
Lion (10.7), Mavericks, Yosemite, or higher for Macs; or Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, or Windows 8 for PCs. Flip to Chapter 3 for details about 
iCloud.
	
✓	iTunes software: More specifically, you need version 10.7 or later of 
iTunes — emphasis on the later because by the time you read this, it will 
be later. After all, iTunes was up to version 12.0 by the time we were pre-
paring this book.
	
	Apple constantly tweaks iTunes to make it better. You can go to www.
itunes.com/download to fetch a copy. Or launch your current version 
of iTunes and then choose iTunes (Help in Windows)➪Check for Updates.
	
	The uninitiated might want to know that iTunes is the nifty Apple juke-
box software that owners of iPods and iPhones, not to mention PCs and 

23
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
Macs, use to manage music, videos, apps, and more. iTunes is at the 
core of the iPad as well, because an iPod is built into the iPad. You can 
use iTunes to synchronize a bunch of stuff from your Mac or PC to and 
from an iPad, including (but not limited to) apps, photos, movies, TV 
shows, podcasts, iTunes U lectures, and of course, music.
	
	Syncing is such a vital part of this process that we devote an entire 
chapter (Chapter 3) to the topic.
	
✓	An Apple ID account: Read Chapter 7 for details on how to set up an 
account. Like most things Apple, the process isn’t difficult. You’ll want 
an account to download content from iTunes, the App Store, or to take 
advantage of iCloud.
	
✓	Internet access: Your iPad can connect to the Internet in either of two 
ways: Wi-Fi or cellular (if you bought an iPad with 3G or 4G capabilities). 
You can connect your iPad to cyberspace via Wi-Fi in your home, office, 
school, favorite coffeehouse, bookstore, or numerous other spots.
	
	At press time, 3G (third-generation) and 4G (fourth-generation) wireless 
data connections were available from many carriers in countries too 
numerous to mention; in the United States, you can choose among AT&T, 
Sprint, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile. Those wireless carriers are pretty 
far along building the zippier 4G (fourth-generation) networks across the 
United States, with Verizon in the lead rolling out the fastest variety, 
called LTE (Long Term Evolution). While the others play catch-up on 
LTE, the latest iPad on AT&T and T-Mobile makes nice with other pretty 
fast networks, including something known as HSPA+.
	
	Unlike with the cellphone contract you may have with your cellular car-
rier, no long-term service commitment is required to connect your iPad 
to the network.
	
	As this book goes to press, data rates (no contract required) are reason-
ably priced as long as you don’t stream or download a lot of movies or 
watch tons of videos while connected over 3G or 4G. For as little as $5 in 
some instances, you can purchase a day pass for data instead of opting 
for a monthly plan.
	
	And T-Mobile, a latecomer as far as selling Apple tablets, is even ­dishing 
out 200 megabytes (MB) of monthly LTE data gratis for people using an 
iPad. That amount of data translates to about 800 Instagram photos, 
more than 2,500 emails, or 200 minutes of streaming music. If you need a 
bigger allotment, you can pay — $20 for 1GB per month, $30 for 3GB, or 
$40 for 5GB, among other options. The following are plan highlights from 
other carriers (keep in mind that all the rate plans cited are subject to 
change and sometimes tied to family plans that include smartphones):
	
•	AT&T: $14.99 a month for 250MB, 3GB for $30, and 5GB for $50
	
•	Sprint: $15 a month for 1GB, 3GB for $35, and 6GB for $50
	
•	Verizon: $20 for 2GB, $30 a month for 4GB, 40 for 6GB, plus $10 for 
monthly access

24
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
A friendly warning pops up on your iPad when you get close to your limit. At 
that point, you can pay more to add to your data bucket or start from scratch 
next month. Keep in mind that with 4G, you’re likely to consume more data in 
a hurry. And prices of course are subject to change.
	
Find a Wi-Fi network if you want to buy, rent, or watch movies.
Turning On and Setting Up the iPad
Unless your iPad is brand-spanking new and fresh out of the box, chances 
are good that you’ve already performed the steps that follow. We cover them 
here because if you choose to use your mini computer-free, these steps make 
up the entire setup process.
Apple has taken the time to partially charge your device, so you get some 
measure of instant gratification and can go ahead and set it up right away by 
following these steps:
	
1.	After taking your iPad out of the box, press and hold down the sleep/
wake button on the upper-right edge.
	
	 An arrow appears near the bottom of the screen, alongside flashing mes-
sages in many languages. We’re pretty sure they all say, “Slide to Set Up,” 
because that’s what the English rendition says.
	
2.	Swipe the Slide to Set Up arrow to the right.
	
3.	Tap to choose your language, followed by your country or region 
preferences.
	
4.	Tap to choose a Wi-Fi network, provide a password (if necessary), and 
then tap the blue Join button or the blue Next button.
	
	 While you can skip this step by tapping the blue Next button without 
selecting a Wi-Fi network, we suggest that you select your network 
now if you can. (If you do wait to set up your Wi-Fi network, turn to 
Chapter 15 to find out how to do so via Settings.)
	
	 The Location Services screen appears.
	
5.	Tap to enable or disable Location Services.
	
	 Location Services is your mini’s way of knowing where you are geo-
graphically. The Maps app, for example, relies on Location Services to 
determine where in the world you are.
	
	 Location Services can be turned on or off globally or for individual apps 
in Settings, as you discover in Chapter 15.
	
	 The Set Up iPad screen appears.

25
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
	
6.	Tap Set Up as New iPad, Restore from iCloud Backup, or Restore from 
iTunes Backup.
	
	 See Chapter 16 for the scoop on restoring from iCloud or iTunes back-
ups. For these steps, tap Set Up as New. The Apple ID screen appears.
	
7.	Tap Sign In with an Apple ID, Create a Free Apple ID, or Skip This Step.
	
	 If you have an Apple ID, sign in with it here; if you don’t have one, tap the 
Create a Free Apple ID button. If you tap Skip This Step and proceed with-
out supplying an Apple ID, you can’t take advantage of the myriad excellent 
and free features described in this and other chapters. Obtain an Apple 
ID if you don’t already have one because you need it to take advantage of 
iCloud. See the end of this chapter for an introduction to this service.
	
	 If you use a different Apple ID for iCloud than you do for iTunes, you can 
enter both at this stage.
	
	 Note that if you skip this step now, you can sign in later by tapping 
Settings➪iCloud➪Account.
	
	 The Terms and Conditions screen appears.
	
8.	Tap the blue Agree button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the 
Agree button in the Terms and Conditions alert box that appears in 
the middle of the screen.
	
	 What happens if you disagree? You don’t want to know. And, of course, 
you won’t be able to use your mini.
	
	 Find more info about iCloud at the end of this chapter, or tap the About 
iCloud link on this screen for the party line from Apple.
	
	 The iCloud screen appears.
	
9.	Do one of the following:
	
•	If you want to use iCloud: Good choice! Tap Use iCloud.
	
•	If you don’t want to use iCloud: Tap Don’t Use iCloud. Don’t worry: If 
you choose not to enable iCloud now, you can enable it at any time 
in the Settings app, as described in Chapter 15.
	
	 The Find My iPad screen appears.
	
10.	Tap either Use Find My iPad or Don’t Use Find My iPad.
	
	 If you misplace your mini, you can use Find My iPad to display its cur-
rent location on a map. You can also choose to display a message or 
play a sound, lock the screen, or erase contents on your missing iPad.
	
	 Find My iPad won’t find your mini if the battery is drained, the iPad is 
turned off, or a network connection (Wi-Fi or cellular) is not available. 
However, if you have iOS 8 software on your iPad, the machine can auto-
matically make note of your last location before the battery pooped out, 
raising the odds of getting back a lost iPad.
	
	 The iMessage and FaceTime screen appears.

26
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
11.	Tap the email address(es) (or phone numbers) you want people to 
use to contact you via iMessage and FaceTime, and then tap the Next 
button in the upper-right corner.
	
	 If phone numbers and email addresses are already selected, tap any that 
you want to deselect.
	
	 The Create a Passcode screen appears.
	
12.	Type a four-digit passcode to unlock this iPad.
	
	 The Re-enter Your Passcode screen appears.
	
	 If you choose a commonly used passcode (such as 1111, 1234, 0000, or 
the like) before the Re-enter Your Passcode screen appears, your iPad 
will warn you that the code you typed can be easily guessed. You can 
either change it or use it anyway — it’s your choice. However, we sug-
gest that you change it if you’re at all concerned about keeping what’s 
on your iPad safe from prying eyes. If you have an iPad mini 3, read the 
sidebar on using the Touch ID fingerprint scanner.
	
13.	Type the four-digit passcode again.
	
	 The iCloud Keychain screen appears.
	
14.	Tap Approve from Other Device to Set Up iCloud Keychain, Use iCloud 
Security Code, or Don’t Restore Passwords.
	
	 iCloud Keychain is an iOS 7 (and later) feature that stores usernames, 
passwords, credit card numbers, and other web data in the cloud. When 
you’ve finished deciding what to do with iCloud Keychain, you see the 
screen for Siri, the loquacious digital assistant living inside your iPad.
	
15.	Tap Use Siri or Don’t Use Siri.
	
	 Your mini offers the desirable option (at least in our humble opinion) of 
using your voice to control the device, as well as the capability to use 
dictation in any app that displays an on-screen keyboard.
	
	 You can find out more about using Siri and dictation in Chapter 14. For 
now, let us just say that we love this feature and use it when appropriate 
(which is often).
	
	 If you choose not to enable Siri at this time, you can switch on this fea-
ture later in the Settings app’s General pane.
	
	 The Diagnostics screen appears.
	
16.	Tap either Automatically Send or Don’t Send to send or not send, 
respectively, anonymous diagnostic and usage data to Apple. Tap to 
respond to a similar request to share app analytics with app develop-
ers to help cut down on crashes.
	
	 The Welcome to iPad screen appears.

27
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
	
17.	Tap Get Started and let the fun begin.
	
	 Your iPad’s Home screen appears in all its glory.
If you’re using mini without a computer, the setup story ends here. Instead of 
using iTunes on your Mac or PC as described in Chapter 3, you have to make 
do with the available options in specific apps and in the Settings app (cov-
ered extensively in Chapter 15).
	
If you ever need to restore your iPad to factory condition, you’d follow the 
same steps, as described in Chapter 16.
Pointing a finger at Touch ID
Apple wants you to give the iPad mini 3 the 
finger. But only in a good way. Setting up 
passcode safeguards is a good idea, and it’s 
something we also touch on in Chapter 15 on 
Settings. Enter the mini 3 with Touch ID, a fin-
gerprint scanner cleverly embedded in the 
Home button. With a gentle press of any des-
ignated finger, you bypass your passcode. 
What’s more, you can use your own digit (not 
the numerical kind) to authenticate iTunes and 
App Store purchases. (Go to Settings➪Touch ID 
& Passcode and make sure that the iTunes & 
App Store switch is turned on.)
You get another benefit through Touch ID on the 
mini 3: the capability to purchase stuff online by 
using a payment technology known as Apple 
Pay. As of this writing, however, you can’t use 
an iPad with Apple Pay to complete a transac-
tion in stores as you can with an iPhone 6 or 6 
Plus. Apple Pay was just launching as this book 
went to press, but Apple had already forged 
partnerships with leading credit card compa-
nies, banks, and merchants.
To set up Touch ID, you must first let your com-
patible iPad get chummy with at least one of 
your fingers, though the system can handle up 
to five individual fingers, yours or anyone else’s 
with whom you share the tablet.
The mini instructs you to press and lift your 
finger against the Home button repeatedly and 
from different orientations. Red lines fill an ani-
mated drawing of a generic fingerprint on the 
screen, giving you a sense of how far along 
you are. The process doesn’t take long, and if 
all goes smoothly, the iPad will soon enough 
declare your efforts to be a success.
What could go wrong? Well, your designated 
digit must be dry. The iPad needs to see your 
entire fingerprint, so don’t try this with a ban-
daged finger or one that has open wounds.
To add fingers after the initial setup, tap 
Settings➪Touch ID & Passcode. Type your 
passcode, and then tap Add a Fingerprint. Then 
repeat the setup drill we just described.
Whether you choose to set up fingerprint 
authentication now, later, or not at all, you 
should still establish an old-fashioned four-
digit passcode as well. In fact, if you do opt to 
go with Touch ID, you must set up a passcode 
as a backup should the iPad fail to recognize 
your paw three times in a row. Hey, it happens. 
Maybe you’re sweating profusely, or you have 
a cut in the wrong place, or you’re wearing 
gloves.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
Locking the iPad
We can think of several sound reasons for locking your mini:
	
✓	You won’t inadvertently turn it on.
	
✓	You keep prying eyes at bay.
	
✓	You spare the battery some juice.
Apple makes locking the iPad a cinch.
	
You don’t need to do anything to lock the iPad; it happens automatically as 
long as you don’t touch the screen for a minute or two. As you find out in 
Chapter 15, you can also set the amount of time your mini must be idle before 
it automatically locks.
Can’t wait? To lock the iPad immediately, press the sleep/wake button.
	
If you have a mini with a smart cover or smart case (or a third-party equiva-
lent), opening and closing the cover locks and unlocks your iPad, but the 
smart cover has the advantage of awakening your iPad without making you 
drag the slider (though you may still have to enter a passcode).
Unlocking the mini is easy, too. Here’s how:
	
1.	Press the sleep/wake button, or press the Home button on the front of 
the screen.
	
	 Either way, the on-screen slider appears.
	
2.	Drag the slider to the right with your finger.
	
3.	Enter a passcode, or press the Home button on a Touch ID-capable 
iPad if you need to.
	
	 See Chapter 15 to find out how to password-protect your iPad.
Mastering the Multitouch Interface
The iPad, like the iPhone, dispenses with a physical mouse and keyboard, 
in favor of a virtual keyboard — a step that seemed revolutionary just a few 
years ago. Nowadays, a virtual keyboard doesn’t seem as novel.
Neither does the fact that the designers of the iPad (and iPhone and iPod 
touch) removed the usual physical buttons in favor of a multitouch display. 
This beautiful and responsive finger-controlled screen is at the heart of the 
many things you do on the iPad.

29
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
In the following sections, you discover how to move around the multitouch 
interface with ease. Later, we home in on how to make the most of the 
keyboard.
Training your digits
Rice Krispies have Snap! Crackle! Pop! Apple’s response for the iPad is Tap! 
Flick! Pinch! Oh yeah, and Drag!
Fortunately, tapping, flicking, pinching, and dragging are not challenging ges-
tures, so you can master many of the mini’s features in no time:
	
✓	Tap: Tapping serves multiple purposes. Tap an icon to open an app from 
the Home screen. Tap to start playing a song or to choose the photo 
album you want to look through. Sometimes, you double-tap (tapping 
twice in rapid succession), which has the effect of zooming in (or out) of 
web pages, maps, and emails.
	
✓	Flick: Flicking is just what it sounds like. A flick of the finger on the 
screen lets you quickly scroll through lists of songs, emails, and picture 
thumbnails. Tap the screen to stop scrolling, or merely wait for the 
scrolling list to stop.
	
✓	Pinch/spread: Place two fingers on a web page, map, or picture, and 
then spread your fingers apart to enlarge the images. Or pinch your 
fingers together to make the map or picture smaller. Pinching and 
spreading (or what we call unpinching) are cool gestures that are easy to 
master and sure to wow an audience.
	
✓	Drag: Here’s where you slowly press your finger against the touchscreen 
without lifting it. You might drag to move around a web page or map 
that’s too large for the mini’s display area.
	
✓	Drag downward from the top of the screen: This special gesture dis-
plays Notification Center (which you find out about in Chapter 13). Press 
your finger at the very top of the screen and drag downward.
	
✓	Drag downward from any Home screen without starting at the very 
top of the screen: This action summons Spotlight search, a discussion 
for later in this chapter.
	
✓	Drag upward from the bottom of the screen: This time, you’re call-
ing up Control Center, a handy repository for music controls, airplane 
mode (see Chapter 15), Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, do not disturb, 
mute/volume, timer (Clocks 
app), camera, AirPlay, and 
brightness controls. Check 
out Figure 2-1 for one view of 
Control Center.
Figure 2-1: We think you’ll call on Control 
Center a lot.

✓	Four- or five-finger swipes and pinches: To quickly multitask or switch 
among or view running apps (see the later section, “Multitasking”), use 
four or five fingers to swipe upward. Swipe left or right (only one finger 
required) to switch between recently used apps. Pinch using four or five 
fingers to jump to your Home screen. Swipe up (one finger will do the 
trick) on an app’s thumbnail to quit it. The four- or five-finger swipes and 
pinches require you to enable Multitasking Gestures in the Settings app’s 
General pane.
Navigating beyond the Home screen
The Home screen, which we discuss in Chapter 1, is not the only screen of 
icons on your tablet. After you start adding apps from the iTunes App Store 
(which you discover in Chapter 11), you may see a row of two or more tiny 
dots just above the main apps parked at the bottom of the screen. Those 
dots denote additional Home screens each containing up to 20 additional 
icons, not counting the 4 to 6 separate icons docked at the bottom of each of 
these Home screens. You can have up to 15 Home screens. You can also have 
fewer docked icons at the bottom of the Home screen, but we can’t think of 
a decent reason why you’d want to ditch any of them. In any case, more on 
these in a moment.
Here’s what you need to know about navigating among the screens:
	
✓	To navigate between screens, flick your finger from right to left or left 
to right across the middle of the screen, or tap directly on the dots. The 
number of dots you see represents the current number of screens on 
your iPad. The all-white dot denotes the screen that you’re currently 
viewing.
	
	You can also drag your finger in either horizontal direction to see a 
different screen. Unlike flicking — you may prefer the term swiping — 
dragging your finger means keeping it pressed against the screen until 
you reach your desired page.
	
✓	Make sure you swipe and not just tap, or you’ll probably open one of the 
app icons instead of switching screens.
	
✓	Press the Home button to jump back to the Home screen. Doing so the 
first time takes you back to whatever Home screen you were on last. 
Tapping Home a second time takes you to the first Home screen.
	
✓	The dock — which contains the Messages, Mail, Safari, and Music icons 
in the bottom row — stays put as you switch screens. In other words, 
only the first 20 icons on the screen change when you move from one 
screen to another.
	
	You can add one or two more icons to the dock. Or move one of the four 
default icons into the main area of the Home screen to make space for 
additional app icons you may use more often, as described later in this 
chapter.

Select, cut, copy, and paste
Being able to select and then copy and paste from one place on a computer 
to another has seemingly been a divine right since Moses, and that’s the case 
on Apple’s smaller display tablet as well. You can copy and paste (and cut) 
with pizzazz.
On the mini, you might copy text or a URL from the web and paste it into an 
email or a note. Or you might copy a bunch of pictures or video into an email.
Suppose you’re in the Notes app, jotting down ideas that you’ll eventually 
copy to an email. Here’s how you would exploit the copy-and-paste feature:
	
1.	Double-tap or press against a word to select it.
	
2.	Tap Select All to grab  
everything.
	
	 You can also drag the blue grab 
points (handles) to select a 
larger block of text or to con-
tract the text you’ve already 
selected, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
Dragging grab points may take a 
little practice.
	
3.	After you select the text, tap Copy. If you want to delete the text block, 
tap Cut instead.
	
4.	Open the Mail program (see Chapter 5) and start composing a message.
	
5.	When you decide where to insert the text you just copied, tap the cursor.
	
	 Up pop the Select, Select All, Paste, Quote Level, and Insert Photo or 
Video commands, as shown in Figure 2-3. (We get to the last two options 
in Chapter 5.)
	
6.	Tap Paste to paste the text into the message.
	
	 Here’s the pizzazz part. If you made a mistake when you were cutting, 
pasting, or typing, shake the mini. Doing so undoes the last edit (pro-
vided that you tap the Undo Paste or Undo option when it appears).
	
	 You also see these options:
	
•	Auto-Correct: If you happen to select a word with a typo, the iPad 
might underline that word. If you tap the underlined work, the iPad 
might show you the word it thinks you meant to spell. Tap that 
suggested word to accept it.
	
•	Predict: New to the mini in iOS 8 is a predictive word feature that 
reveals up to three word or phrase options in buttons just above 
the keyboard. If one of these words or phrases is what you had in 
mind, tap the appropriate button.
Figure 2-2: Drag the grab handles to select text.

32
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
•	Replace: The iPad may  
show you possible 
replacement words. For 
example, replacement 
words for test might be 
fest, rest, or text. Tap the 
word to substitute it for 
the word you originally typed.
	
•	Define: Tap your selected word for a definition, courtesy of the 
New Oxford American Dictionary, the Oxford Dictionary of English, 
an Apple dictionary, or a foreign language dictionary if you’ve 
downloaded any dictionaries onto your iPad.
Multitasking
Through multitasking, you can run numerous apps in the background simul-
taneously and easily switch from one app to another. The following examples 
illustrate what multitasking enables you to do on your iPad:
	
✓	A third-party app, such as Slacker Personal Radio, continues to play music 
while you surf the web, peek at pictures, or check email. Without multi-
tasking, Slacker would shut down the moment you opened another app.
	
✓	A navigation app can update your position while you’re listening to, say, 
Pandora Internet radio. From time to time, the navigation app will pipe 
in with turn-by-turn directions, lowering the volume of the music so that 
you can hear the instructions.
	
✓	If you’re uploading images to a photo website and the process is taking 
longer than you want, you can switch to another app, confident that the 
images will continue to upload behind the scenes.
	
✓	Leave voice notes in the Evernote app while checking out a web page.
Multitasking couldn’t be easier — and it’s become pretty smart through the 
various iOS upgrades. Now your iPad can anticipate your needs. For example, 
if it detects, over time, that you tend to turn to your social networking apps 
around the same time every morning, it will make sure the feeds are ready 
for you.
Double-press (not double-tap) the Home button. You see preview pages with 
icons just below them for any open apps, as shown in Figure 2-4. Scroll to the 
right or left to see more apps. Tap the icon or preview screen for the app you 
want to switch to: The app remembers where you left off. (Scroll all the way 
to the left, and you’ll also see a preview screen for the last Home screen you 
opened.) If you hold the tablet sideways in landscape mode, the previews for 
your apps appear sideways, too.
Figure 2-3: Tap Paste and text will appear.

33
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
Figure 2-4: Scroll to see the apps you’ve recently used or are still running.
	
At the top of Figure 2-4, note a cool new iOS 8 shortcut: circular snapshots of 
the people with whom you most recently communicated. Tap the circular pic-
ture to call the person (via FaceTime) or to send him or her a message.
Apple insists that multitasking will not overly tax the battery or exhaust 
system resources. The iPad conserves power and resources by putting apps 
in a state of suspended animation. And your iPad will schedule updates only 
during power-efficient times, such as when your device is connected to Wi-Fi.
Still, we think it’s a good idea to shut down apps you’re not using because 
you’ll see a battery hit over time. To remove an app from the multitasking 
rotation, swipe up the app’s preview. Poof — it’s gone.
	
You can use the four- or five-finger gesture to swipe upward to reveal your 
multitasking options and to swipe left or right to switch between apps. From 
this multitasking view, you can pinch with four or five fingers to return to the 
Home screen. It’s a cool gesture.
Organizing icons into folders
Finding the single app that you want to use among apps spread out over 
15 screens may seem like a daunting task. But Apple felt your pain and 
added a handy organizational tool: folders. The Folders feature lets you 

34
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
create folder icons, each containing apps that pertain to the name that Apple 
assigned or you gave to that folder.
To create a folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	Press your finger against an icon until all the icons on the screen 
wiggle.
	
2.	Decide which apps you want to move to a folder and then drag the 
icon for the first app on top of the second app.
	
	 The two apps now share living quarters inside a newly created folder. 
Apple names the folder according to the category of apps inside the 
folder.
	
3.	(Optional) Change the folder name by tapping the X on the bar where 
the folder name appears and typing a new name.
To launch an app inside a folder, tap that folder’s icon and then tap the icon 
for the app that you want to open.
You have plenty of room for all your apps. Indeed, you can stash up to 9 apps 
per page in a folder and have as many as 15 pages. That’s a grand total of 126 
(more, we suspect, than you’d possibly ever want to tuck away in a folder).
When you drag all the apps from a folder, the folder automatically disap-
pears. You can also drag apps on or off the dock.
Printing
Through the feature known as AirPrint, you can print wirelessly from the mini 
to an AirPrint-capable printer. The first of these compatible features emerged 
on more than a dozen HP printers; now you have offerings from Epson, 
Canon, and others.
AirPrint works with Mail, Photos, Safari, and iBooks (PDF files). You can also 
print from apps in Apple’s iWork software suite, as well as third-party apps 
with built-in printing.
	
An AirPrint printer doesn’t need any special software, but it does have to be 
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the iPad.
To print, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Tap the share icon, and then tap the Print command.
	
	 The icon is shown in the margin.
	
2.	In the Printer Options bubble that appears, tap Select Printer to select 
a printer, which the iPad locates in short order.

35
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
	
3.	Depending on the printer, specify the number of copies you want to 
print, the number of double-sided copies, and a range of pages to print.
	
4.	When you’re happy with your settings, tap Print.
If you display the preview pages while a print job is underway, the Print Center 
icon appears with all your other recently used apps. A badge indicates how 
many documents are in the print queue, along with the currently printing 
document.
Searching for content on your iPad
Using the Safari browser (see Chapter 4), you can search the web via Google, 
Yahoo!, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. If you’ve added a foreign language keyboard, 
other options may present themselves. For example, with a Chinese keyboard 
enabled, you can summon the Baidu search engine.
You can search also for people and programs across your mini and within 
specific apps. We show you how to search within apps in the various chap-
ters dedicated to Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Music.
	
Searching across the iPad is based on the powerful Spotlight feature familiar 
to Mac owners. Spotlight became even more useful in iOS 8 by taking on an 
additional search load. You can now search for news and trending topics, 
local restaurants, movie times, and content in Apple’s own iTunes Store, App 
Store, and iBooks Store.
Here’s how the search feature works:
	
1.	Swipe down from any Home 
screen to access Spotlight.
	
	 A bar slides into view at the top 
of the screen.
	
2.	Tap the bar and use the virtual 
keyboard to enter your search 
query.
	
	 The iPad spits out results the 
moment you type a single char-
acter; the list narrows as you 
type additional characters.
	
	 The results are pretty darn thor-
ough. Say that you entered Ring 
as your search term, as shown 
in Figure 2-5. Contacts whose 
last names have Ring in them 
show up, along with friends who 
might do a trapeze act in the 
Figure 2-5: Putting the Spotlight on search.

36
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
Ringling Bros. circus. All the songs on your iPad by Ringo Starr show up 
too, as do such song titles as Tony Bennett’s “When Do the Bells Ring 
for Me,” if that happens to be in your library. The same goes for apps, 
videos, audiobooks, events, and notes with the word Ring.
	
3.	Tap any listing to jump to the contact, ditty, or app you seek.
In Settings (see Chapter 15), you can specify the order of search results so 
that apps come first, contacts second, songs third, and so on.
	
At the bottom of the Spotlight results list, you can tap to move your search 
query to the web (using your designated search engine) or to Wikipedia, the 
online encyclopedia.
The Incredible, Intelligent, and 
Virtual iPad Keyboard
As you know by now, instead of a physical keyboard, several soft, or virtual, 
English-language or (depending upon what you chose during setup) foreign-
language keyboard layouts slide up from the bottom of the mini screen, 
including variations on the alphabetical keyboard, the numeric and punctua-
tion keyboard, and the more punctuation and symbols keyboard.
Indeed, the beauty of a software 
keyboard is that you see only the 
keys that are pertinent to the task at 
hand. The layout you see depends 
on the app. The keyboards in Safari 
differ from the keyboards in Mail. 
For example, in Mail, you’ll see a 
Return key. The similarly placed key 
in Safari is labeled Go. Figure 2-6 
displays the difference between 
the Mail (top) and Safari (bottom) 
keyboards.
Before you consider how to actually 
use the keyboard, we want to share 
a bit of the philosophy behind its 
so-called intelligence. Knowing what makes this keyboard smart can help you 
make it even smarter when you use it. The keyboard
	
✓	Has a built-in English dictionary that even includes words from today’s 
popular culture. Dictionaries in other languages are automatically acti-
vated when you use a given international keyboard, as described in an 
article on the web at www.dummies.com/extras/ipad.
Figure 2-6: The keys on the Mail (top) and 
Safari (bottom) keyboards.

37
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
	
✓	Adds your contacts to its dictionary automatically.
	
✓	Uses complex analysis algorithms to predict the word you’re trying to type.
	
✓	Suggests corrections as you type. It then offers you the suggested word 
just below the misspelled word. When you decline a suggestion and the 
word you typed is not in the iPad dictionary, the iPad adds that word to 
its dictionary and offers it as a suggestion if you mistype a similar word 
in the future.
	
	Decline incorrect suggestions (by tapping the characters you typed as 
opposed to the suggested words that appear below what you’ve typed). 
This extra step helps your intelligent keyboard become even smarter.
	
✓	Reduces the number of mistakes you make as you type by intelligently 
and dynamically resizing the touch zones for certain keys. The iPad 
increases the zones for keys it predicts might come next and decreases 
the zones for keys that are unlikely or impossible to come next, although 
you can’t see this behavior.
Anticipating what 
comes next
	
The keyboards on your 
mini became even more 
useful with the arrival of 
iOS 8. Now the keyboard 
takes an educated stab at 
the next word you mean 
to type and presents 
what it surmises to be 
the best possible word 
choices front and center. 
Say you’re in the 
Messages app and the 
last message you 
received was an invita-
tion to lunch or dinner. 
Above the row of keys on 
the iPad keyboard, you’d 
see buttons with three 
word suggestions: 
Dinner, Lunch, and Not 
sure (as shown in 
Figure 2-7). If one of 
those were the appropri-
ate response, you could 
tap the button to insert 
its text into your reply.
Figure 2-7: The iPad keyboard predicts what you might want 
to type next.

38
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
If you wanted to respond with something different than the three options 
presented by Apple, you’d just type your response with the regular QWERTY 
keys. As you type additional letters and words, the three suggested word 
choices above the keyboard change in real time. For instance, if you start by 
typing That is a in your message, the new trio of word choice buttons that 
show up might be good, great, and very.
Such QuickType keyboard predictions vary by app and even according to the 
person with whom you are communicating. So the predictive text choices 
that show up in Messages when you’re involved in an exchange with a friend 
are likely to be more casual than those in an email to your boss.
To exploit the predictive typing feature, make sure the Predictive setting is 
turned on (as it is by default). Go to Settings➪General➪Keyboard, and slide 
the Predictive switch to on.
Such suggestions don’t appear only in English. If you’re using an international 
keyboard, suggestions are presented in the appropriate language.
Discovering the special-use keys
The iPad keyboard contains several keys that don’t actually type a character. 
Here’s the scoop on each of these keys:
	
	
✓	Shift: If you’re using the alphabetical keyboard, the shift key switches 
between uppercase and lowercase letters. You can tap the key to change 
the case, or hold down shift and slide to the letter you want to be 
capitalized.
	
✓	Caps lock: To turn on caps lock and type in all caps, you first need to 
enable the Caps Lock setting (if it’s not already enabled) by tapping 
Settings➪General➪Keyboard and then tapping the Enable Caps Lock 
item to turn it on. After the Caps Lock setting is enabled, double-tap the 
shift key to turn on caps lock. (The arrow will be white and the shift key 
itself will be a darker shade of gray.) Tap the shift key again to turn off 
caps lock. To disable caps lock, just reverse the process by turning off 
the Enable Caps Lock setting (tap Settings➪General➪Keyboard).
	
	
✓	Typewriter: Enable the Split Keyboard option (tap Settings➪General➪​
Keyboard), and you can split the keyboard in a thumb-typist-friendly 
manner, as shown in Figure 2-8. 
When you’re ready to split your 
keyboard, press and hold down 
the typewriter icon key, and tap 
Split on the menu. From that 
menu you can also dock the 
keyboard to the bottom of the 
screen. When you want to bring 
the keyboard back together, 
Figure 2-8: Press and hold down the typewriter 
icon key to split the keyboard.

39
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
press and hold down the typewriter icon key again and choose either 
Merge or Dock and Merge from the menu.
	
	
✓	#+= or 123: If you’re using a keyboard that shows only numbers and 
symbols, the traditional shift key is replaced by a key labeled #+= or 
123 (sometimes shown as .?123). Pressing that key toggles between key-
boards that just have symbols and numbers.
	
	
✓	International keyboard: You see this key only if you’ve turned on 
an international (or third-party) keyboard, as explained on the web at 
www.dummies.com/extras/ipad. From this key, you can also pull 
up an emoji keyboard with numerous smiley faces and pictures.
	
	
✓	Delete: Tapping this key (otherwise known as the backspace key) erases 
the character immediately to the left of the cursor.
	
	
✓	Return: This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line. You 
might find this key labeled Go or Search, depending on the app you’re 
using.
	
	
✓	Hide keyboard: Tap this key to hide the keyboard. Tap the screen in the 
appropriate app to bring back the keyboard.
	
	
✓	Dictation: Tap the microphone icon and start talking. The iPad listens 
to what you have to say. Tap the key again, and the mini attempts to 
convert your words into text. You can use this dictation feature in many 
of the instances in which you can summon the keyboard, including 
the built-in Notes and Mail apps, as well as many third-party apps. See 
Chapter 14 for more on dictation.
	
	When you use dictation, the things you say are recorded and sent to 
Apple, which converts your words into text. Just make sure to proofread 
what you’ve said because the process isn’t foolproof. Apple also collects 
other information, including your first name and nickname, the names 
and nicknames of folks in your Contacts list, song names in Music, and 
more. Apple says it does this to help the Dictation feature perform its 
duties. If any of this freaks you out, however, tap Settings➪General➪ 
Keyboard and slide the Dictation switch to off. You can also restrict the 
use of dictation in Settings, as explained in Chapter 15.
Choosing an alternative keyboard
	
As part of iOS 8, Apple for the first time permits you to choose an alternative 
keyboard from a third-party app developer, a welcome change to the produc-
ers of SwiftKey, Swype, Ginger, and Fleksy keyboards, which debuted on the 
rival Android mobile operating system. You can fetch new keyboards in the 
App Store. Some are free; some require a modest sum.
After you’ve downloaded a keyboard, visit Settings➪General➪Keyboard➪ 
Keyboards➪Add New Keyboard and select the keyboard of choice. Then 

40
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
press and hold down on the international keyboard key (globe icon) on 
the iPad’s own keyboard, and select your new keyboard from the list that 
appears. Alternatively, keep tapping the globe icon until the keyboard you 
want takes over.
Finger-typing on the virtual keyboards
The virtual keyboards in Apple’s multitouch interface just might be consid-
ered a stroke of genius. Or they just might drive you nuts.
If you’re patient and trusting, in a week or so, you’ll get the hang of finger-
typing — which is vital to moving forward, of course, because you rely on a 
virtual keyboard to tap a text field, enter notes, type the names of new con-
tacts, and so on.
As we note earlier in this chapter, Apple has built intelligence into its virtual 
keyboard, so it can correct typing mistakes on the fly or provide helpful 
word choices by predicting what you’re about to type next. The keyboard 
isn’t exactly Nostradamus, but it does an excellent job of coming up with the 
words you have in mind. We’ve found that tapping one of the predictive but-
tons appears to speed things up as well as bolster our typing accuracy.
	
As you start typing on the virtual keyboard, we think you’ll find the following 
additional tips helpful:
	
✓	See what letter you’re typing. 
As you press your finger against 
a letter or number on the 
screen, the individual key you 
press darkens until you lift your 
finger, as shown in Figure 2-9. 
That way, you know that you 
struck the correct letter or 
number.
	
✓	Slide to the correct letter if you 
tap the wrong one. No need to 
worry if you touched the wrong 
key. You can slide your finger 
to the correct key because the 
letter isn’t recorded until you 
release your finger.
	
✓	Tap and hold down to access 
special accent marks, alter-
native punctuation, or URL 
endings. Sending a message 
to an overseas pal? Keep your 
finger pressed against a letter, and a row of keys showing variations 
Figure 2-9: The ABCs of virtual typing.

41
 Chapter 2: iPad mini Basic Training
on the character for foreign 
alphabets pops up, as shown 
in Figure 2-10. This row lets 
you add the appropriate accent 
mark. Just slide your finger until 
you’re pressing the key with the 
relevant accent mark and then 
lift your finger.
	
	Meanwhile, if you press and 
hold down the .? key in Safari, 
it offers you the choice of .us, .org, .edu, .com, or .net with additional 
options if you also use international keyboards. Pretty slick stuff, except 
we miss the dedicated .com key that was on the keyboard prior to iOS 7. 
You can bring the key back by holding down the period key and then 
releasing your finger when .com is highlighted.
	
✓	Tap the space bar to accept a suggested word, or tap the suggested 
word to decline the suggestion. Alas, mistakes are common at first. 
Say that you meant to type a sentence in the Notes app that reads, “I 
am typing an important . . .” But because of the way your fingers struck 
the virtual keys, you actually entered “I am typing an importsnt . . .” 
Fortunately, Apple knows that the a you meant to press is next to the s 
that showed up on the keyboard, just as t and y and e and r are side by 
side. So the software determines that important was indeed the word 
you had in mind and, as Figure 2-11 reveals, places it front and center 
among the three predictive text buttons. You’ll note that the suspect 
word is highlighted. To accept 
the suggested word, merely tap 
the space bar. And if for some 
reason you actually did mean 
to type importsnt, tap that word 
instead among the predictive 
buttons that appear.
	
	If you don’t appreciate these features, you can turn off Auto-Correction 
and Predictive in Settings. See Chapter 15 for details. See Chapter 20 for 
autocorrection tricks.
	
Because Apple knows what you’re up to, the virtual keyboard is fine-tuned for 
the task at hand, especially when you need to enter numbers, punctuation, or 
symbols. The following tips help you find common special characters or spe-
cial keys that we know you’ll want to use:
	
✓	Putting the @ in an email address: If you’re composing an email mes-
sage (see Chapter 5), a dedicated @ key pops up on the main Mail key-
board when you’re in the To field choosing whom to send a message to. 
That key disappears from the first view when you tap the body of the 
message to compose your words. You can still get to the @ by tapping 
the .?123 (or 123) key.
Figure 2-10: Accenting your letters.
Figure 2-11: Fixing an important mistake.

42
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
✓	Switching from letters to numbers: When you’re typing notes or send-
ing email and want to type a number, symbol, or punctuation mark, tap 
the .?123 (or 123) key to bring up an alternative virtual keyboard. Tap 
the ABC key to return to the first keyboard. This toggle isn’t hard to get 
used to, but some may find it irritating.
	
✓	Adding apostrophes and other punctuation shortcuts: If you press and 
hold down the exclamation mark/comma key, a pop-up offers the apos-
trophe. If you press and hold down the question mark/period key, you’ll 
see the option to type quotation marks.
	
We already mentioned that the mini, unlike some tablets from the past (and a 
few in the present), eschews a pen or stylus. But sometimes you might want 
to call upon a digital pen, and third-party companies fill the bill. For example, 
Wacom sells various Bamboo Stylus models, starting around $15. It’s a poten-
tially useful tool for those with too broad, oily, or greasy fingers, or those 
who sketch, draw, or jot notes. You can find lower-priced styluses as well.
Editing mistakes
We think typing with abandon, without getting hung up over mistyped char-
acters, is a good idea. The self-correcting keyboard can fix many errors (and 
occasionally introduce errors of its own). That said, plenty of typos are 
likely to turn up, especially in the beginning, and you have to correct them 
manually.
	
A neat trick for doing so is to hold your finger against the screen to bring up 
the magnifying glass. Use the magnifying glass to position the pointer on the 
spot where you need to make the correction. Then use the delete key (also 
called the backspace key) to delete the error and press whatever keys you 
need to type the correct text.
And with that, you are hereby notified that you’ve survived basic training. 
The real fun is about to begin.

e have good news and . . . more good news. The good 
news is that you can easily set up your iPad mini 
so that your contacts, appointments, reminders, events, 
mail settings, bookmarks, books, music, movies, TV 
shows, podcasts, photos, and apps are synchronized 
between your computer and your iPad (or other 
iDevices). And the more good news is that after you 
set it up, your contacts, appointments, events, and 
everything else we just mentioned can be kept up 
to date automatically in multiple places — on one 
or more of your computers and iPad, iPhone, and 
iPod touch devices.
Here’s more good news: Whenever you make a change 
in one place, it’s reflected almost immediately in all the 
other places it occurs. So if you add or change an appoint-
ment, an event, or a contact on your iPad while you’re out and 
about, the information is automatically updated on your computers and 
iDevices. If no Wi-Fi or cellular network is available at the time, the update 
syncs the next time your iPad encounters a wireless network, all with no fur-
ther effort on your part.

44
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
This communication between your iPad and computer is called syncing 
(short for synchronizing). Don’t worry: It’s easy, and we walk you through the 
entire process in this chapter.
But wait. We have even more good news. Items that you choose to manage 
on your computer, such as movies, TV shows, podcasts, and email account 
settings, are synchronized only one way — from your computer to your iPad, 
which is the way it should be.
The information in this chapter is based on iTunes version 12.0 and iOS 
version 8.0, the latest and greatest when these words were written. If your 
screens don’t look exactly like ours, you probably need to upgrade to 
iTunes 12 or higher (choose iTunes➪Check for Updates), or iOS 8 or higher 
(on your iPad, tap Settings➪General➪Software Update), or both. Both 
upgrades — iTunes and iOS — are free, and offer useful new features not 
found in their predecessors.
	
Because Apple updates iTunes and iOS often, having the latest and greatest ver-
sion is a double-edged sword. Sometimes you’ll see something in the book that 
looks different on your iPad because you’re using a newer version of iOS than we 
had when we wrote this. If you encounter a figure or an instruction that conflicts 
with what you’re seeing on your iPad (and you’re certain you’re using the latest 
and greatest versions of both iTunes and iOS), please drop us a note so that we 
can make any necessary changes; our email addresses appear at the end of this 
book’s introduction.
	
iOS 8 does let you set up your iPad mini computer-free (and as such, you’re 
not required to sync your iPad with a computer running iTunes). Turn to 
Chapter 2 if you really want to set up your iPad mini computer-free. But some 
things are easier with a computer than without.
In this chapter, you find out how to sync all the digital data your iPad can 
handle.
A Brief iCloud Primer
Apple’s iCloud service is more than just a wireless hard drive in the sky. 
iCloud is a complete data synchronization and wireless storage solution. In a 
nutshell, iCloud stores and manages your digital stuff — your music, photos, 
contacts, events, and more — and makes it available to all your computers 
and iDevices automatically.
iCloud pushes information such as email, calendars, contacts, reminders, 
and bookmarks to and from your computer and to and from your iPad and 
other iDevices, and then keeps those items updated on all devices wirelessly 
and without any effort on your part. iCloud also includes nonsynchronizing 
options, such as photo stream (see Chapter 9) and email (see Chapter 5).

45
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
Your free iCloud account includes 5GB of storage, which is all many users 
will need. If you have several devices (including Macs and PCs) or like saving 
data in the cloud, you’ll probably find yourself needing more storage; 20- and 
200-gigabyte upgrades are available for $1 and $4 a month, respectively.
A nice touch is that music, apps, periodicals, movies, and TV shows pur-
chased from the iTunes Store, as well as your photo stream and iTunes Match 
content (see Chapter 7), don’t count against your 5GB of free storage. iBooks 
don’t count against your 5GB either, but audiobooks do. You’ll find that the 
things that do count — such as mail, documents, photos taken with your iPad 
camera, account information, settings, and other app data — don’t use much 
space, so 5GB may last a long time.
	
Sync iPad photos with a computer every so often and then delete the photos 
from the iPad. Otherwise, over time, those photos will take up a lot of space.
If you plan to go PC-free but still want to have your email, calendars, contacts, 
and bookmarks synchronized automatically and wirelessly (and believe us, 
you do) between computers and other iDevices, here’s how to enable iCloud 
syncing on your iPad:
	
1.	On your Home screen, tap Settings.
	
2.	In the list of settings on the left, tap iCloud.
	
3.	Tap Account, and then provide your Apple ID and password (if you 
haven’t provided it previously).
	
4.	Tap Done.
A list of apps appears. Tap any individual on/off switch to enable or disable 
iCloud sync for Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari (Bookmarks), 
Notes, and PassBook.
In the same list are five items that don’t have switches:
	
✓	Photos: Enable or disable three iCloud services with the by now familiar 
on/off switches (see Chapter 9 for details):
	
•	iCloud Photo Library: Automatically upload and store your entire 
photo library in iCloud. (This option is new in iOS 8.) The benefit is 
that you can access all your photos and videos on all your Macs 
and iDevices. One possible downside: This option could put you 
over iCloud’s free 5GB limit.
	
•	My Photo Stream: Automatically upload photos you shoot with 
your iPad camera and send them to all your devices when con-
nected to Wi-Fi.
	
•	iCloud Photo Sharing: Create and share albums with other iCloud 
users, or subscribe to other iCloud users’ shared albums.

46
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
✓	iCloud Drive: This new iOS 8 feature lets iCloud-savvy apps open and 
save documents and data in iCloud:
	
•	iCloud Drive: Allow apps to use iCloud Drive.
	
•	Look Me Up By Email: Tap to see a list of apps that allow other 
people to look you up by your Apple ID. When enabled, users of 
the app will be able to look for you by your first and last names.
	
•	Use Cellular Data: Use cellular data for sending and receiving data 
from your iCloud Drive. This one’s enabled only on Wi-Fi + cellular 
iPads, of course. We suggest that you enable this option only if you 
are fortunate enough to have an unlimited data plan.
	
✓	Backup: Enable or disable iCloud backup, which backs up your photo 
library, accounts, documents, and settings whenever your iPad is 
plugged in, locked, and connected to Wi-Fi. Tap the Back Up Now button 
to initiate a backup, well, now.
	
✓	Keychain: Keep passwords and credit card information you save up to 
date on all devices you approve. The info is encrypted and can’t be read 
by Apple (or, we hope, by anyone else).
	
✓	Find My iPad: Tap this option to reveal two choices. The first is Find 
My iPad, so you can locate, lock, or erase your iPad and prevent anyone 
else from erasing or reactivating it without your password. The second 
option, Send Last Location, tells the iPad to send its location when the 
battery gets critically low.
	
Tap Storage, near the top of the screen, to manage your iCloud storage or 
upgrade your storage plan.
You find out much more about iCloud in the rest of this chapter and several 
other chapters, so let’s move on to syncing your iPad.
Syncing with iTunes
Synchronizing your iPad with iTunes on a Mac or PC provides three main 
benefits over computer-free iPad use:
	
✓	iTunes makes it easier to manage your media — your music, movies, 
apps, and so on — than managing it directly on your iPad.
	
✓	Managing your iPad’s contents with iTunes provides numerous options 
that you won’t find anywhere on your iPad.
	
✓	Managing your iPad’s apps and Home screen layouts is much easier in 
iTunes than on your iPad.
Synchronizing your iPad with your computer is a lot like syncing an iPod 
or iPhone with your computer. If you’re an iPod or iPhone user, the process 

47
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
will be a piece of cake. But even if you’ve never used an iPod, an iPhone, or 
iTunes, the process isn’t difficult. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Start by connecting your iPad to your computer with the USB cable 
that came with your iPad.
	
	 When you connect your iPad to your computer, iTunes should launch 
automatically. If it doesn’t, chances are that you plugged the cable into 
a USB port on your keyboard, monitor, or hub. Try plugging it into one 
of the USB ports on your computer instead. Why? Because USB ports 
on your computer supply more power to a connected device than USB 
ports on a keyboard, monitor, or most hubs, and the iPad requires a lot 
of that power — even more than an iPod or an iPhone.
	
	 You may see an alert asking whether you want iTunes to open automati-
cally when you connect this iPad. Click Yes or No, depending on your 
preference. You have the opportunity to change this setting later if you 
like, so don’t give it too much thought.
	
	 If iTunes still doesn’t launch automatically, try launching it manually.
	
	
2.	Click the iPad icon (shown in the margin) at the top left.
	
	 If you use more than one iDevice with this computer and you hover the 
pointer over the iPad icon, you’ll see the number of devices (for ­example, 
3 Devices). If you have multiple devices, clicking the button displays a 
drop-down list with all your devices.
	
	 If you don’t see the iPad icon and you’re positive that it’s connected to a 
USB port on your computer (not the keyboard, monitor, or hub), try 
restarting your computer.
	
	 The Welcome to Your New iPad screen appears.
	
3.	Click Set Up as New iPad or select a backup from the Restore from 
This Backup drop-down menu and then click Continue.
	
	 See Chapter 16 for the scoop on restoring from iCloud or iTunes back-
ups. For this example, we’ll tap Set Up as New.
	
	 The Sync with iTunes screen appears.
	
4.	Click the Get Started button.
	
	 The iPad screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
5.	Click the Summary tab near the top of the window on the left, as 
shown in Figure 3-1.
	
	 If you don’t see a Summary tab, make sure your iPad is still connected. 
If you don’t see your iPad’s name near the top-left corner of the iTunes 
window, as shown in Figure 3-1, go back to Step 3 and try again.
	
6.	(Optional) If you want to rename your iPad, click its name and type a 
new one.
	
	 We renamed the one in Figure 3-1 Bob L’s iPad mini.

48
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
Figure 3-1: The Summary pane is pretty painless.
From the Summary pane, you can set any options that you want from the 
Options area:
	
✓	Open iTunes When This iPad Is Connected check box: Select this 
option if you want iTunes to launch automatically whenever you connect 
your iPad to your computer. Why might you choose not to enable this 
option? If you intend to connect your iPad to your computer to charge 
it, for example, you might not want iTunes to launch every time you con-
nect it. If you do choose to enable it, iTunes launches and synchronizes 
automatically every time you connect your iPad.
	
	Don’t worry about this setting too much right now. As usual, if you 
change your mind, you can always come back to the Summary pane and 
deselect the Open iTunes When This iPad Is Connected check box.

49
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
	
	If you do select the Open iTunes When This iPad Is Connected check box 
but don’t want your iPad to sync automatically every time it’s connected, 
launch iTunes and choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences 
(PC). Click the Devices tab at the top of the window and select the Prevent 
iPods, iPhones, and iPads from Syncing Automatically check box. This 
method prevents your iPad from syncing automatically, even if the Open 
iTunes When This iPad Is Connected option is selected. If you choose this 
option, you can sync your iPad by clicking the Sync or Apply button that 
appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window when your iPad is 
selected in the sidebar. (The Apply button is shown in Figure 3-1.)
	
✓	Sync with This iPad Over Wi-Fi: If you want to sync automatically over 
your Wi-Fi connection, select this check box.
	
	If you choose to sync wirelessly, your iPad and computer must be on the 
same Wi-Fi network and your iPad must be plugged into a power source 
for syncing to occur.
	
✓	Sync Only Checked Songs and Video: If you want to sync only items 
that have check marks to the left of their names in your iTunes library, 
select this check box. If you choose to use Apple’s iTunes Match cloud-
based storage (described in Chapter 7), as we have in Figure 3-1, this 
option will appear dimmed and be unavailable.
	
✓	Prefer Standard Definition Videos: If you want high-definition videos you 
import to be automatically converted into smaller standard-definition 
video files when you transfer them to your iPad, select this check box.
	
	Standard-definition video files are significantly smaller than high-definition 
video files. You’ll hardly notice the difference when you watch the video 
on your iPad (unless it’s an iPad with a Retina display, in which case you’ll 
almost certainly notice), but you can have more video files on your iPad 
because they take up less space.
	
	The conversion from HD to standard definition takes a long time, so be 
prepared for very long sync times when you sync new HD video and 
have this option selected.
	
	If you plan to use Apple’s digital AV adapter (choose the dock version or 
Lightning version, as appropriate), or Apple TV ($99) to display movies 
on an HDTV, consider going with high definition. Although the files will 
be bigger and your iPad will hold fewer videos, the HD versions look 
spectacular on a big-screen TV. There’s more info on these accessories 
in Chapter 17.
	
✓	Convert Higher Bit Rate Songs to 128/192/256 Kbps AAC: If you want 
songs with bit rates higher than 128, 192, or 256 Kbps converted into 
smaller AAC files when you transfer them to your iPad, select this check 
box and choose the lower bit rate from the drop-down menu (which 
reads 128 kbps in Figure 3-1).

50
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
	A higher bit rate means that the song will have better sound quality but use 
a lot of storage space. Songs that you buy at the iTunes Store or on Amazon, 
for example, have bit rates of around 256 Kbps. So a four-minute song with 
a 256-Kbps bit rate is around 8MB; convert it to 128-Kbps AAC, and it’s 
roughly half that size (that is, around 4MB) while sounding almost as good.
	
	Most people don’t notice much (if any) difference in audio quality when 
listening to music on most consumer audio gear. So unless you have 
your iPad hooked up to a great amplifier and superb speakers or head-
phones, you probably won’t hear much difference, but your iPad can 
hold roughly twice as much music if you choose this option. Put another 
way, we’re picky about our audio, and we both used to select this option 
to allow us to carry more music around with us on our iPads before we 
subscribed to iTunes Match. Neither of us has noticed the lower bit-rate 
songs sounding much different (or worse) with the types of headphones 
and speakers we use with our iPads.
	
✓	Manually Manage Videos: To turn off automatic syncing in the Video 
panes, select this check box.
One more thing: If you decide to select the Prevent iPods, iPhones, and 
iPads from Syncing Automatically check box on the Devices tab in iTunes 
Preferences (that’s iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac and Edit➪Preferences on a 
PC), you can still synchronize manually by clicking the Sync or Apply button 
in the lower-right corner of the window.
	
Why the Sync or Apply button? Glad you asked. If you’ve changed any sync 
settings since the last time you synchronized, the Sync button instead says 
Apply. When you click that button — regardless of its name — your iPad will 
start to sync.
Backing Up Your iPad mini
Whether you know it or not, your iPad backs up your settings, app data, 
photos and videos you shoot, and other information whenever you connect 
to a computer and use iTunes to sync with, update, or restore your iPad.
	
Every time you sync your iPad and computer, most (but not all) of your iPad 
content, including (but not limited to) photos in the Camera Roll album, text 
messages, notes, contact favorites, and sound settings is backed up to either 
your computer’s hard drive or to iCloud before the sync begins. Most of your 
media, including songs, TV shows, and movies, isn’t backed up in this process. 
This shouldn’t be a problem; these files should be restored when you sync with 
iTunes again.
Backups are saved automatically and stored on your computer by default, or 
you can choose to back up to iCloud by clicking the appropriate button in the 
iTunes Summary pane.

51
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
To switch to backing up to iCloud using iTunes on your computer, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Connect the iPad to the computer.
	
	 If iTunes doesn’t launch automatically when you connect the iPad, 
launch it now.
	
2.	Click the iPad icon near the top of the window on the left.
	
	 If you use more than one iDevice with this computer, select the device 
from the drop-down list that appears when you click the iPad icon.
	
3.	On the left, click the Summary tab.
	
4.	In the Automatically Back Up section, click iCloud.
If you choose to back up to your computer, you can encrypt your backups 
with a password by selecting the Encrypt iPad Backup check box.
If anything goes wonky, or you get a new iPad, you can restore most (if not 
all) of your settings and files that aren’t synced with iCloud or iTunes on your 
computer. Or, if you’ve backed up an iPhone, an iPod touch, or another iPad, 
you can restore the new iPad from the older device’s backup.
If you’re using an iPad computer-free, here’s how to enable backing up to 
iCloud from your iPad, which we strongly suggest computer-free iPad users 
do without further delay:
	
1.	Tap Settings➪iCloud.
	
2.	Tap Backup.
	
3.	Tap iCloud Backup to switch it on (green).
	
Choosing this option means your iPad no longer backs up automatically if 
you connect it to a computer.
If you are a computer-free iPad user, you don’t care because you never con-
nect your iPad to a computer. But if you sync your iPad with your computer 
like many folks do, give some thought to which option suits your needs. 
Restoring from a computer backup requires physical or Wi-Fi access to that 
computer, but you don’t need Internet access. Restoring from iCloud requires 
Internet access — and can happen anywhere on Earth that has it.
One last thing to look at on the Backup section: If you want to password-
protect your iPad backups (your iPad creates a backup of its contents 
automatically every time you sync), be sure to also select the Encrypt iPad 
Backup check box from the Backup area.
Backups are good; select one or the other and move on.

52
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
Disconnecting the iPad mini
When an iPad is connected to your 
computer, you see the eject icon to 
the right of its name in the devices 
drop-down menu (Bob L’s iPad mini 
in Figure 3-2). If your iPad is con-
nected and syncing, you’ll instead 
see the sync icon (Bob L’s iPad maxi 
in the figure).
At the same time, a message appears 
at the top of the iTunes window to 
inform you that your iPad is syncing, 
as shown in Figure 3-3.
When the sync is finished, the sync 
icon in Figure 3-2 stops spinning and 
morphs back into an eject icon, and the message in Figure 3-3 disappears.
	
If you disconnect your iPad before the sync finishes, all or part of the sync 
may fail. Although early termination of a sync isn’t usually a problem, it’s 
safer to cancel the sync and let it finish gracefully than to yank the cable out 
while a sync is in progress. So just don’t do that, okay?
To cancel a sync properly and disconnect your iPad safely from your Mac or 
PC, click the little x-in-a-circle to the left of the sync message in iTunes, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
Synchronizing Your Data
Your next order of business is to tell iTunes what data you want to synchro-
nize between your iPad and your computer.
To get started, first select your iPad by clicking the iPad icon (or the devices 
drop-down menu, if you have more than one iDevice) just below the search 
field. Then click the Info tab, which is the last tab in the Settings list on the left.
If you’re using iCloud to sync contacts, calendars, bookmarks, or notes, you 
won’t be able to enable these items in iTunes, as we’re about to describe. 
Turn off iCloud syncing on your iPad (Settings➪iCloud) for items you want to 
sync with your Mac.
On some displays you may see only one or two sections at any time and have 
to scroll up or down to see the others.
Figure 3-2: During a sync, the eject icon turns 
into a sync icon.
Figure 3-3: Click the x-in-a-circle to cancel a 
sync.

53
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
The Info pane has five sections: Sync Contacts, Sync Calendars, Sync Mail 
Accounts, Other, and Advanced. The following sections look at them one by 
one. One last thing: To use your iPad with your Google or Yahoo! account, 
you must first create an account on your iPad, as described in Chapter 5. 
After you’ve created a Yahoo! or Google account on your iPad, you can enable 
contact or calendar syncing with it in the Settings app’s Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars section.
Contacts
In Figure 3-4, note that the section 
is named Sync Contacts because 
this image was captured on a Mac. 
Contacts (formerly known as Address 
Book) is the Mac application that 
syncs with your iPad’s Contacts app.
If you use a PC, you see a drop-down 
list that gives you the choices of 
Outlook, Google Contacts, Windows 
Address Book, or Yahoo! Address 
Book. Don’t worry — the process 
works the same on either platform.
The iPad syncs with the following address book programs:
	
✓	Mac: Contacts and other address books that sync with Contacts, such as 
Microsoft Outlook 2011 or the discontinued Microsoft Entourage
	
✓	PC: Windows Contacts (Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8), Windows 
Address Book (XP), Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Outlook Express
	
✓	Mac and PC: Yahoo! Address Book and Google Contacts
You can sync contacts with multiple apps.
Here’s what each option does:
	
✓	All Contacts: One method is to synchronize all your contacts, as shown 
in Figure 3-4. This will synchronize every contact in your Mac or PC 
address book with your iPad’s Contacts app.
	
✓	Selected Groups: You can synchronize any or all groups of contacts 
you’ve created in your computer’s address book program. Just select 
the appropriate check boxes in the Selected Groups list, and only those 
groups will be synchronized.
	
If you sync with your employer’s Microsoft Exchange calendar and contacts, 
any personal contacts or calendars already on your iPad will be wiped out.
Figure 3-4: Want to synchronize your contacts? 
This is where you set up things.

54
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
Calendars
The Calendars section of the Info 
pane determines how synchroniza-
tion is handled for your appoint-
ments, events, and reminders. You 
can synchronize all your calendars, 
as shown in Figure 3-5. Or you can 
synchronize any or all individual cal-
endars you’ve created in your com-
puter’s calendar program. Just select 
the appropriate check boxes.
The iPad syncs with the following 
calendar programs:
	
✓	Mac: iCal or Calendar
	
✓	PC: Microsoft Exchange and Outlook 2003, 2007, and 2010
	
✓	Mac and PC: Google and Yahoo! Calendars
You can sync calendars with multiple apps.
Advanced
Every so often, the contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on your 
iPad get so screwed up that the easiest way to fix things is to erase that infor-
mation from your iPad and replace it with information from your computer.
If that’s the case, go to the Advanced section of the Info pane and click to 
select the Contacts or Calendars check boxes (or both). Then, the next time 
you sync, that information on your iPad will be replaced with the contacts or 
calendars from your computer.
	
Because the Advanced section is at the bottom of the Info pane and you have 
to scroll down to see it, you can easily forget that the Advanced section is 
there. Although you probably won’t need to use this feature very often (if 
ever), you’ll be happy you remembered that it’s there if you do need it.
One last thing: Check boxes in the Advanced section are disabled for items 
not selected. If you’re using iCloud and you want to replace any of these 
items on your iPad, you must first enable that item as discussed in the previ-
ous sections of this chapter. In other words, to replace contacts or calendars 
we had to disable iCloud syncing before we could enable the check boxes to 
replace the Contacts and Calendars on this iPad.

events here.

 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
Synchronizing Your Media
If you chose to let iTunes manage synchronizing your data automatically, wel-
come. This section looks at how you get your media — your music, podcasts, 
videos, and photos — from your computer to your iPad.
	
Podcasts and videos (but not photos) from your computer are synced only 
one way: from your computer to your iPad. If you delete a podcast or a video 
that got onto your iPad via syncing, the podcast or video will not be deleted 
from your computer when you sync.
That said, if you buy or download any of the following items from the Apple 
iTunes, iBooks, or App Store on your iPad, the item will be copied back to 
your computer automatically when you sync:
	
✓	Songs
	
✓	Ringtones
	
✓	Podcasts
	
✓	Videos
	
✓	iBooks, e-books, and audiobooks
	
✓	Apps
	
✓	Playlists that you create on your iPad mini
And if you save pictures from email messages, the iPad camera, web pages 
(by pressing and holding down on an image and then tapping the Save 
Image button), or screen shots (which can be created by pressing the Home 
and sleep/wake buttons simultaneously), these too can be synced using 
your favorite photo application (as long as it’s iPhoto, Aperture, or Adobe 
Photoshop Elements).
You use the Apps, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, iTunes U, Books, 
Audiobooks, Tones, and Photos panes to specify the media that you want to 
copy from your computer to your iPad. The following sections explain the 
options you find in each pane.
To view any of these panes, make sure that your iPad is still selected and 
then click the appropriate tab in the list of Settings on the left.
The following sections focus only on syncing. If you need help acquiring 
apps, music, movies, podcasts, or anything else for your iPad, just flip to the 
most applicable chapter for help.
	
The last step in each section is “Click the Sync or Apply button in the lower-
right corner of the window.” You have to do this only when selecting that 
item for the first time and if you make any changes to the item after that.

Sharp-eyed readers may notice that we aren’t covering syncing iPad apps in 
this chapter. Apps are so darn cool that we’ve given them an entire chapter, 
namely Chapter 11. In that chapter, you discover how to find, sync, rearrange, 
review, and delete apps, and much, much more.
Music, music videos, and voice memos
To transfer music to your iPad mini, select the Sync Music check box in 
the Music pane. You can then select the option for Entire Music Library or 
Selected Playlists, Artists, and Genres. If you choose the latter, select the 
check boxes next to particular playlists, artists, and genres you want to trans-
fer. You also can choose to include music videos or voice memos or both by 
selecting the appropriate check boxes at the top of the pane (see Figure 3-6).
If none of the options just mentioned sounds just right (pun intended), you 
may prefer using the On This iPad tab, which is covered in some detail later 
in this chapter.
Figure 3-6: Use the Music pane to copy music, music videos, and voice memos from your  
computer to your iPad mini.

 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
	
If you choose Entire Music Library and have more songs in your iTunes 
library than storage space on your iPad, you’ll see an error message when 
you try to sync. You’ll also see a yellow alert on the right side of the capacity 
chart at the bottom of the screen, along with how much over your iPad’s 
capacity adding the entire music library would make you. To avoid such 
errors, select playlists, artists, and genres that total less than the free space 
on your iPad, which is also displayed in the capacity chart at the bottom of 
the iTunes screen.
	
Music, podcasts, and video are notorious for using massive amounts of stor-
age space on your iPad. If you try to sync too much media content, you see 
lots of error messages. Forewarned is forearmed.
Finally, if you select the Automatically Fill Free Space with Songs check box, 
iTunes fills any free space on your iPad with music. Think long and hard 
about enabling this option. We recommend against it because when it’s 
enabled, you can easily run out of space for pictures and videos you shoot or 
documents you save (to name just a few of the possible consequences of fill-
ing your iPad with songs).
Movies
To transfer movies to your iPad mini, select the Sync Movies check box and 
then choose an option for movies you want to include automatically from 
the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 3-7. If you choose an option other than 
All, you can optionally select individual movies and playlists by selecting the 
boxes in appropriate sections.
How much space did I use?
If you’re interested in knowing how much 
free  space is available on your iPad, look 
near the bottom of the iTunes window while 
your iPad is connected. You’ll see a chart that 
shows the contents of your iPad, color-coded 
for your convenience. As you can see in the 
figure, this iPad has 48.89GB of free space. 
Hover your cursor over any color to see a 
bubble with info on that category, as shown 
in the figure.
You can find similar information about space 
used and space remaining on your iPad by tap-
ping Settings➪General➪Usage. The iPad’s dis-
play isn’t as pretty as the one pictured here, but 
it is useful when you need that info and you’re 
not near your computer.

Figure 3-7: Your choices in the Movies pane determine which movies are copied to your iPad.
TV shows
The procedure for syncing TV shows is slightly different from the procedure 
for syncing movies. First, select the Sync TV Shows check box to enable TV 
show syncing. Then choose how many episodes to include and whether you 
want all shows or only selected shows from the two pop-up menus, as shown 
in Figure 3-8. If you want to also include individual episodes or episodes on 
playlists, select the appropriate check boxes in the Shows, Episodes, and 
Include Episodes from Playlists sections of the TV Shows pane.
	
Regardless of the choices you make in the pop-up menus, you can always 
select individual episodes by selecting their check boxes.
Podcasts, iTunes U, and books
You can also sync podcasts, educational content from iTunes U, two types of 
books — e-books for reading and audiobooks for listening — and photos.
	
If you like to read e-books or watch or listen to podcasts or iTunes U courses, 
visit the App Store (see Chapter 11) and grab copies of Apple’s free Podcasts, 
iBooks, and iTunes U apps. Audiobooks, on the other hand, don’t require a 
special app; you can listen to them using the Music app (see Chapter 7).

59
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
Figure 3-8: These menus determine how TV shows are synced with your iPad.
Podcasts
To transfer podcasts to your iPad, select the Sync Podcasts check box in the 
Podcasts pane. Then you can automatically include however many podcasts 
you want by making selections from the two pop-up menus, the same way 
you did for TV Shows. If you have podcast episodes on playlists, you can 
include them by selecting the appropriate check box in the Include Episodes 
from Playlists section.
iTunes U
To sync educational content from iTunes U, first select the Sync iTunes U 
check box to enable iTunes U syncing. Then choose how many episodes to 
include and whether you want all collections or only selected collections 
from the two pop-up menus. If you want to also include individual items or 
items on playlists, select the appropriate check boxes in the Items section 
and Include Items from Playlists section of the iTunes U pane.
Books
By now we’re sure you know the drill: You can sync all your e-books and 
audiobooks as well as just sync selected titles by choosing the appropriate 
buttons and check boxes in the Books pane.

60
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
To sync e-books, you need the free iBooks app; if you don’t already have it, 
you can download it from the App Store. For more information on apps and 
the App Store, read Chapter 11. To start using iBooks, see Chapter 10.
Tones
If you have custom ringtones in your iTunes library, select the Sync Ringtones 
check box in the Tones pane. Then you can choose either all ringtones or indi-
vidual ringtones by selecting their check boxes. Ringtones can be used also as 
text tones and alarms.
Photos
Syncing photos is a little different from syncing other media because your 
iPad has a built-in camera — two cameras, actually — and you may want to 
copy pictures or videos you take with the iPad to your computer, as well as 
copy pictures stored on your computer to your iPad.
The iPad syncs photos and videos with the following programs:
	
✓	Mac: Aperture version 3.2 or later or iPhoto version 9.2 or later
	
✓	PC: Adobe Photoshop Elements or Adobe Photoshop Album
You can also sync photos with any folder on your computer that contains 
images.
In the Photos pane, select the Sync Photos From check box, and then 
choose an application or folder from the pop-up menu (which says iPhoto in 
Figure 3-9).
If you choose an application that supports photo albums (such as Photoshop 
Elements, Aperture, or iPhoto), projects (Aperture), events (iPhoto), facial 
recognition and places (Aperture or iPhoto), or any combination thereof, you 
can automatically include recent projects (Aperture), events (iPhoto), or faces 
(Aperture and iPhoto) by making a selection from the same pop-up menu.
Note that although Photoshop Elements includes features called Places and 
Faces, those features are not supported by your iPad.
	
You can also type a word or phrase in the search field (in the upper right) to 
search for a specific event or events.
If you choose a folder full of images, you can create subfolders inside it that 
will appear as albums on your iPad. But if you choose an application that 
doesn’t support albums or events, or a single folder full of images with no 
subfolders, you have to transfer all or nothing.

61
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
Figure 3-9: The Photos pane determines which photos will be synchronized with your iPad.
Because we selected iPhoto in the Sync Photos From menu, and iPhoto 9.6 
(the version installed on our Mac) supports projects and faces in addition 
to albums and photos, we have the option of syncing any combination of 
photos, projects, albums, and faces.
If you’ve taken any photos with your iPad or saved images from a web page, 
an email, an MMS message, or an iMessage since the last time you synced, 
the appropriate program launches (or the appropriate folder is selected), and 
you have the option of uploading the pictures to your computer.
Manual Syncing
This chapter has focused on automatic syncing thus far. Automatic syncing 
is great; it selects items to sync based on criteria you’ve specified, such as 
genre, artist, playlist, and album. But it’s not efficient for transferring a few 
items — songs, movies, podcasts, or other files — to your iPad mini.
The solution? Manual syncing. With automatic syncing, iTunes updates your 
iPad automatically to match your criteria. Changes to your iTunes library 
since your last sync are synced automatically to your iPad. With manual 
syncing, you merely drag individual items to your iPad.

62
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPad mini 
	
Automatic and manual sync aren’t mutually exclusive. If you’ve set up auto-
matic syncing, you can still sync individual items manually.
You can manually sync music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and iTunes U les-
sons but not photos and info such as contacts, calendars, and bookmarks.
To configure your iPad for manual syncing:
	
1.	Connect your iPad to your computer via USB or Wi-Fi.
	
	 If iTunes doesn’t open automatically, open it manually.
	
2.	Click the iPad icon.
	
	 If you have more than one iDevice, the iPad icon becomes a drop-down 
menu listing all your connected iDevices. Click the icon to display the 
menu with your devices, and then select the device you want.
	
3.	(Optional) Click the Summary tab. In the Options section, select 
Manually Manage Music and Videos.
	
	 This step disables automatic syncing for music and videos.
	
	 If you’re happy with automatic syncing and just want to get some audio or 
video from your computer to your iPad mini, feel free to skip this step.
To add items from iTunes to your iPad mini without using the syncing con-
trols or performing an actual sync, first click the icon for the type of media 
you want to copy to your iPad — music, movies, or TV shows — or click the 
ellipsis (. . .) to select podcasts, iTunes U, audiobooks, or tones. Then start 
dragging the media to the left. As you do, a new pane appears on the left side 
of the iTunes window. Drag the media to this pane, as shown in Figure 3-10, 
and the media will be copied to your iPad immediately.
Figure 3-10: Drag and drop to copy media to your iPad mini.

63
 Chapter 3: Synchronicity: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPad mini
	
In Figure 3-10, we dragged John Lennon & the Plastic Ono Band’s “Love” from 
the My Music tab, using the Artists view. You can just as easily drag media from 
the other items in the menu: Song List, Artists, Genres, or Composers. And you 
can add other types of content, such as movies, TV shows, podcasts, and 
books. Just click the appropriate icon or the ellipsis. (We selected the music 
icon in the figure.)
You can add a media file to your iPad mini without syncing at least one other 
way. As before, your iPad has to be connected to your computer via Wi-Fi or 
USB, so you have to see the iPad icon above the picture of your iPad or this 
(as well as the previous method) won’t work.
The other way to add media to your iPad without syncing is to click the little 
ellipsis (. . .) in a circle next to songs, albums, movies, TV shows, books, and 
other media. Choose Add To from the pop-up menu and a new list appears; 
choose your iPad in the list and the file will be added to your iPad.
And that’s pretty much all you need to know to sync files automatically or 
manually. And if you haven’t figured out how to watch movies or listen to 
audio on your iPad yet, it’s only because you haven’t read Part III on multime-
dia, where watching and listening to your iPad are made crystal clear.

ou feel like you’re actually holding the web right in the palm of your 
hand.”
When an Apple marketer says such a thing to describe surfing the web 
on the iPad, a lot of truth is behind it. The spectacular 7.9-inch 
Retina display on the iPad mini 2 and mini 3, combined with 
the Apple-designed A7 chips inside the machines, makes 
browsing on Apple’s tablets an absolute delight. The 
screen isn’t as nice on the original iPad mini, but 
holds its own just the same.
In this chapter, you discover the pleasures — and 
the few roadblocks — in navigating cyberspace on 
your iPad.
Surfin’ Dude
A version of the Apple Safari web browser is a major 
reason that the Net on the iPad is very much like the Net 
you’ve come to expect on a more traditional computer. Come to 
think of it, the Internet often looks a lot better on iPad minis with the 
striking Retina display. Safari for the Mac and for Windows are two of the 
very best web browsers in the business. In our view, Safari on the iPhone has 
no rival as a cellphone browser. As you might imagine, Safari on the iPad is 
even more appealing.
“

Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Exploring the browser
We start our cyberexpedition with a quick tour of the Safari browser. Take 
a gander at Figure 4-1. Not all browser controls found on a Mac or a PC are 
present, but Safari on the iPad mini still has a familiar look and feel. We 
describe these controls and others throughout this chapter.
Figure 4-1: The iPad’s Safari browser.
Before plunging in, we recommend a little detour. Find out more about the 
wireless networks that enable you to surf the web on the iPad in our web 
extras at www.dummies.com/extras/ipad.

69
 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
Blasting off into cyberspace
Surfing the web begins with a web address, of course.
	
Here are a few tips for using the keyboard in Safari (and see Chapter 2 for 
more help with using the virtual keyboard):
	
✓	Because so many web addresses end with the suffix .com (pronounced 
dot com), the virtual keyboard 
has a few shortcuts worth 
noting. Press and hold your 
finger against the ? key, and 
you’ll see that .com option. 
You’ll see other common web 
suffixes as well — .edu, .net, 
.org, .us, .ro, and .eu. Some 
options appear only if you’ve 
selected an international 
keyboard (as discussed in 
Chapter 2).
	
✓	The moment you tap a letter, 
you see a list of web addresses 
that match those letters. For 
example, if you tap the letter 
E (as we did in the example 
shown in Figure 4-2), you see 
web listings for eBay, ESPN, and 
others. Tapping U or H instead 
may display listings for USA 
TODAY or the Houston Chronicle 
(shameless plugs for the news-
papers where we’re columnists).
	
Models with Siri can lend a hand, um, voice, as you surf. If you call upon Siri 
and ask the voice genie inside the mini to open the Safari app, Siri obliges. If 
you mention a specific website to Siri —  “ESPN.com,” say — Siri opens your 
designated search engine (Google, Bing, or Yahoo!), as discussed later in this 
chapter. And if Siri heard you right, the site you mentioned appears at the top 
of the search results.
When you tap certain letters, the mini has three ways to determine websites 
to suggest:
	
✓	Bookmarks: The iPad suggests websites you’ve bookmarked from the 
Safari or Internet Explorer browser on your computer (and synchro-
nized, as we describe in Chapter 3). More on bookmarks later in this 
chapter.
Figure 4-2: Web pages that match your search 
letter.

70
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
✓	History: The iPad suggests sites from the history list — those cyberdes-
tinations where you recently hung your hat. Because history repeats 
itself, we also tackle that topic later in this chapter.
	
✓	Smart search field: When you type an address in the search field, you 
see icons for sites you frequent most often, and you can tap any of those 
icons to jump immediately to that site.
You might as well open your first web page now — and it’s a full HTML page, 
to borrow from techie lingo:
	
1.	Tap the Safari icon docked at the bottom of the Home screen.
	
	 If you haven’t moved it, it’s a member of the Fantastic Four on the dock 
(along with Messages, Mail, and Music). Chapter 1 introduces the Home 
screen.
	
2.	Tap the smart search field (refer to Figure 4-1).
	
3.	Begin typing the web address, or URL, on the virtual keyboard that 
slides up from the bottom of the screen.
	
4.	Do one of the following:
	
•	To accept one of the bookmarked (or other) sites that show up in the 
list, merely tap the name.
	
	Safari automatically fills in the URL in the address field and takes 
you where you want to go.
	
•	Keep tapping the proper keyboard characters until you enter the com-
plete web address for the site you have in mind and then tap the Go 
key on the right side of the keyboard.
	
	You don’t need to type www at the beginning of a URL. So if you 
want to visit www.theonion.com (for example), typing theonion.
com is sufficient to transport you to the humor site. For that 
matter, Safari can take you to this site even if you type theonion 
without the .com.
	
Because Safari on the iPad mini runs a variation of the iPhone mobile operat-
ing system, every so often you may run into a site that serves up the light, or 
mobile, version of a website, sometimes known as a WAP site. Graphics may 
be stripped down on these sites. Alas, the producers of these sites may be 
unwittingly discriminating against you for dropping in on them by using an 
iPad. In fact, you may be provided a choice of which site you want — the light 
or the full version. Bravo! If not, you have our permission to berate these site 
producers with letters, emails, and phone calls until they get with the 
program.

71
 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
Zoom, zoom, zoom
If you know how to open a web page (if you don’t, read the preceding section 
in this chapter), we can show you how radically simple it is to zoom in on 
pages so that you can read what you want to read and see what you want to 
see, without enlisting a magnifying glass.
Try these neat tricks for starters:
	
✓	Double-tap the screen so that the area of the display that you make con-
tact with fills the entire screen. It takes just a second before the screen 
comes into focus. By way of example, check out Figure 4-3, which shows 
two views of the same Sports Illustrated web page. In the first view, you see 
what the page looks like when you first open it. In the second one, you see 
how the menu of stories box takes over much more of the screen after you 
double-tap it. The area of the screen you double-tapped is the area that 
swells. To return to the first view, double-tap the screen again.
Figure 4-3: Doing a double-tap dance zooms in and out.
	
✓	Pinch the page. Sliding your thumb and index finger together and then 
spreading them apart (or, as we like to say, unpinching) also zooms in 
and out of a page. Again, wait just a moment for the screen to come into 
focus.
	
✓	Press down on a page and drag it in all directions, or flick through a 
page from top to bottom. You’re panning and scrolling, baby.

72
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
✓	Rotate the mini to its side. This action reorients from portrait view to 
a widescreen landscape view. The keyboard is also wider in this mode, 
making it a little easier to enter a new URL. However, this little bit of 
rotation magic won’t happen if you set and enabled the screen orienta-
tion lock feature, which we describe in Chapter 1.
Reading clutter-free web pages
It’s all too easy to get distracted reading web pages nowadays, what with ads, 
videos, and other clutter surrounding the stuff you want to take in. So pay 
attention to the horizontal lines that often appear in the smart search field, 
as shown in Figure 4-4 (left). Tap those lines to view the same article without 
the needless diversions, as shown in Figure 4-4 (right). Tap the lines again to 
return the standard web view.
Figure 4-4: Reducing clutter when reading a web story.
Finding Your Way around Cyberspace
In this section, we discuss ways to navigate the Internet on your iPad mini by 
using links and tabs.

73
 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
Looking at lovable links
Because Safari functions on the mini the same way that browsers work on 
your Mac or PC, links on the device behave in much the same way.
Text links that transport you from one site to another typically are under-
lined, are shown in blue, red, or bold type, or appear as items in a list. Tap 
the link to go directly to the site or page.
Tapping other links leads to different outcomes:
	
✓	Open a map: Tapping a map launches the Maps app that is, um, 
addressed in Chapter 6.
	
✓	Prepare an email: Tap an email address, and the iPad opens the 
Mail program (see Chapter 5) and prepopulates the To field with that 
address. The virtual keyboard is also summoned so that you can add 
other email addresses and compose a subject line and message. Note 
that this shortcut doesn’t always work.
	
To see the URL for a link, press your finger on the link and hold it there until a 
list of options appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Use this method also to determine whether a pic-
ture has a link. Just hold your finger down on the 
picture; if it’s linked, you see the web address to 
which the link points.
As for the link options shown in Figure 4-5, here’s 
what two of them do:
	
✓	Open: Opens the page in this tab.
	
✓	Copy: Copies the link’s URL to your 
iPad’s Clipboard so that you can paste it 
elsewhere.
You read more about the other two options — Open in New Tab and Add to 
Reading List — a little later in this chapter.
Not every web link cooperates with the iPad because it doesn’t support some 
common web standards — most notably, Adobe Flash video. If you see an 
incompatible link, nothing may happen — or a message may appear, asking 
you to install a plug-in.
This lack of support for Adobe Flash video is a void that is (frankly) unlikely 
to ever get addressed. Even Adobe is no longer embracing Flash for mobile 
devices. Apple does support the ever-popular HTML5 standard for audio and 
video, which Adobe, too, is now backing.
Figure 4-5: Press and hold down 
on a link, and a list of options 
appears.

74
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Tabbed browsing
When we surf the web on a Mac or PC, we rarely go to a single web page and 
call it a day. In fact, we often have multiple web pages open at the same time. 
Sometimes we choose to hop around the web without closing the pages we 
visit. Sometimes a link automatically opens a new page without shuttering 
the old one. (If these additional pages are advertisements, this behavior isn’t 
always welcome.)
Safari on the iPad lets you open multiple pages simultaneously, via a brilliant 
rendition of tabbed browsing similar to the desktop version of browsers such 
as Safari.
After you have one page open, you have two ways to open additional web 
pages in Safari so that they appear 
on the tab bar at the top of the 
screen (rather than replace the page 
you’re currently viewing):
	
✓	Tap the + icon (see Figure 4-6) 
near the top-right corner of 
the browser. A new tab named 
Favorites appears, as shown 
in Figure 4-6. Now type a URL, 
tap a bookmark or an icon for 
a favorite or frequently visited 
site, or initiate a search, and the 
result will appear in this tab.
	
✓	Hold your finger on a link until 
a list of options appears (refer 
to Figure 4-5), and then tap 
Open in New Tab.
To switch tabs, just tap the tab. To 
close a tab, tap the gray X that appears 
on the left edge of the active tab.
You can manage tabs in one other 
way. Tap the view open tabs icon in 
the top-right corner of the browser 
(refer to Figure 4-1) to summon 
thumbnail views of your open web 
pages, as shown in Figure 4-7. You 
can tap the X on any thumbnail to 
close it. From here you can also 
go into private browsing mode 
(discussed later in this chapter) 
or check out iCloud tabs, the topic 
we’re about to dive into.
Figure 4-6: A new tab, ready to display any 
page you choose.
Figure 4-7: A thumbnail view of all your open 
tabs.

 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
iCloud tabs
Although the mini is your likely traveling companion just about everywhere 
you go, we know that you also browse the web from your smartphone or 
personal computer. If that smartphone happens to be an iPhone and the com-
puter is a Macintosh (or a Windows PC running Safari), you can take advan-
tage of iCloud tabs, a feature that lets you resume reading web pages that 
you started looking at on those other devices. The feature works with the 
iPod touch, too. If you read the preceding section, you already know how to 
access iCloud tabs: Tap the View Open Tabs icon to bring up tab view, which 
is shown in Figure 4-7. In this example, there are open tabs on Edward’s 
MacBook Air and on Edward’s iPad, which is a remote iPad. Tap a link to open 
the page on your tablet.
Revisiting Web Pages Time and Again
Surfing the web would be a drag if you had to enter a URL every time you 
wanted to navigate from one page to another. So you can find those favorite 
websites in the future, the mini provides bookmarks, web clips, reading lists, 
and history lists.
Book(mark) ’em, Dano
You already know how useful bookmarks are and how you can synchronize 
bookmarks from the browsers on your computer. It’s equally simple to book-
mark a web page directly on the iPad. Follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Make sure that the page you want to bookmark is open, and then tap 
the share icon (shown in the margin) at the top of the screen.
	
	 You have many options beyond bookmarking when you tap the share 
icon (refer to Figure 4-1, though not all the options are visible in the 
figure). You can tap Message, Mail, Twitter, or Facebook. Sina Weibo 
and Tencent Weibo (Chinese variations of Twitter) are also available, 
provided you added a Chinese keyboard in Settings (see Chapter 2). Or 
you can tap Add Bookmark, Add to Reading List, Add to Home Screen, 
Copy, and Print, as we show you here. You can also use the wireless 
feature called AirDrop to share the page with people nearby via Wi-Fi or 
Bluetooth, provided they have a fourth-generation iPad or later, the iPad 
mini, or a Mac with OS X Yosemite or later. See Chapter 13 to find out 
how to use AirDrop.
	
2.	Tap Add Bookmark.
	
	 A new Add Bookmark window opens with a default name for the book-
mark, its web address, and its folder location.

76
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
3.	Give it a name and folder location:
	
•	Accept the default bookmark name and default bookmark folder: Tap 
Save.
	
•	Change the default bookmark name: Tap the x-in-a-circle next to the 
name, enter the new title (using the virtual keyboard), and then tap 
Save.
	
•	Change the location where the bookmark is saved: Tap the > symbol 
to the right of the suggested location (likely Favorites), tap the 
folder where you want the bookmark to be kept so that a check 
mark appears, and then tap Save.
To open a bookmarked page after you set it up, tap the bookmarks icon, 
which is to the left of the smart search field. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
	
If you don’t see bookmarks right away, make sure that the leftmost of the 
three tabs at the top of the screen is highlighted in blue. The other tabs are 
for the reading list and for shared links — those shared by your contacts 
from selected social networks.
If the bookmark you have in mind is buried inside a folder, tap the folder 
name first and then tap the bookmark you want.
Altering bookmarks
If a bookmarked site is no longer meaningful, you can change it or get rid of it:
	
✓	To remove a bookmark (or folder), tap the bookmarks icon and then 
tap Edit. Tap the red circle next to the bookmark you want to toss off the 
list, and then tap Delete.
	
	To remove a single bookmark or folder, swipe its name from left to right 
and then tap the red Delete button.
	
✓	To change a bookmark name or location, tap Edit at the bottom-right 
corner of the Bookmarks window. Tap a given bookmark, and an Edit 
Bookmark window appears, with the name, URL, and location of the 
bookmark already filled in. Tap the fields you want to change. In the 
Name field, tap the X in the gray circle and then use the keyboard to 
enter a new title. In the Location field, tap the > symbol and scroll up or 
down the list until you find a new home for your bookmark.
	
✓	To create a new folder for your bookmarks, tap Edit and then tap New 
Folder. Enter the name of the new folder, and choose where to put it.
	
✓	To move a bookmark up or down in a list, tap Edit and then drag the 
three bars to the right of the bookmark’s name to its new resting place.

 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
	
If you take advantage of iCloud, the web pages you’ve bookmarked on your 
Mac and on your other iOS devices will be available on the mini, and vice versa.
Saving to your reading list
When you visit a web page you’d like to read, 
but just not now, the reading list feature is sure 
to come in handy, including when you’re offline. 
Here’s how it works:
	
✓	Saving a page for later: Tap the share icon 
and then tap Add to Reading List. Or, if 
you see a link to a page you’d like to read 
later, press on the link until a list of options 
appears (refer to Figure 4-5) and then tap 
Add to Reading List.
	
✓	Reading a page on your reading list: Tap 
the bookmarks icon and tap the page in the 
reading list, as shown in Figure 4-8.
	
✓	Keeping track of what you’ve read: Tap 
Show Unread to display only those items 
you haven’t read yet. Tap Show All to show 
all the items in the reading list.
	
✓	Removing items from the reading list: 
Swipe the item from right to left, and then 
tap its red Delete button.
	
The reading list feature used to require an active 
Internet connection, which is why we always 
admired the superb save-to-read-later Instapaper 
app — and still do. It’s now free in the App Store, 
though there are also premium subscription 
options that add functionality separate from the Safari reading list.
In Settings, you can choose to use your cellular network (if available) to save 
reading list items from iCloud so you can read them offline.
Finally, don’t forget that you can share your reading list (and bookmarks) 
among your computers and iOS devices with iCloud, as described in 
Chapter 3.
Clipping a web page
You frequent lots of websites, some way more than others. For example, 
perhaps you consult the train schedule several times during the day. In 
their infinite wisdom, the folks at Apple let you bestow special privileges on 
Figure 4-8: Tap a page in the 
reading list to read it.

78
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
frequently visited sites, not just by bookmarking pages but also by affording 
them their unique Home screen icons. Apple used to call these web clips, and 
we still like the term. Creating one is dead simple. Follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Open the web page in question, and tap the share icon (shown in the 
margin).
	
2.	Tap Add to Home Screen.
	
	 Apple creates an icon out of the area of the page that was displayed 
when you saved the clip, unless the page has its own custom icon.
	
3.	Type a new name for your web clip or leave the one that Apple 
suggests.
	
4.	Tap Add.
	
	 The icon appears on your Home screen.
	
As with any icon, you can remove a web clip by pressing and holding down 
on its icon until it starts to wiggle. Tap the X in the corner of the icon, and 
then tap Delete. You can also move the web clip to a more preferred location 
on one of your Home screens or on the dock.
Letting history repeat itself
Sometimes you want to revisit a site that you failed to bookmark, but you 
can’t remember the darn destination or what led you there in the first place. 
Good thing you can study the history books.
Safari records the pages you visit and keeps the logs on hand for several 
days. Here’s how to access your history:
	
1.	Tap the bookmarks icon and then tap History.
	
	 The History option is at the top of the bookmarks list.
	
2.	Tap the day you think you hung out at the site.
	
	 Sites are listed under such headings as “This Morning,” “Thursday 
Evening,” or “Thursday Morning,” or segregated by a specific date.
	
3.	When you find the listing, tap it.
	
	 You’re about to make your triumphant return.
	
To clear your history so that nobody else can trace your steps — and just 
what is it you’re hiding? — tap Clear at the bottom-right corner of the history 
list. You can clear the last hour, clear only the day that you tapped Clear, 
clear today and yesterday, or clear all your history. Alternatively, starting on 
the Home screen, tap Settings➪Safari➪Clear History and Website Data. In 
both instances, per usual, you have a chance to back out without wiping the 
slate clean.

 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
Saving web pictures
You can capture most pictures you come across on a website — but be mind-
ful of any potential copyright violations, depending on what you plan to do 
with the images. To copy an image from a website, follow these steps:
	
1.	Press your finger against the image.
	
2.	Tap the Save Image button that appears, as 
shown in Figure 4-9.
	
	 Saved images end up in your Photos library 
in the Camera Roll folder, from which they 
can be synced back to a computer.
	
	 Tap Copy instead, and you can paste the 
image into an email or as a link in a program 
such as Notes.
	
	 In some cases, typically advertisements, you also see an Open button or 
an Open in New Tab button, which takes you to the ad image.
Sharing Your Web Experiences
When you find a great website that you just must share, use Safari to tweet it, 
post it to Facebook, or — go old-school — print it.
To make Twitter and Facebook work, of course, the iPad must know your 
username and password, which you can fill add in Settings (see Chapter 15).
	
	 Tap the share icon (shown in the margin), and you find these sharing options:
	
✓	AirDrop: Share the page with other people who have compatible 
devices and AirDrop. You’ll need to turn on AirDrop in Control Center 
(just drag upward from the bottom of the screen). Then you can choose 
whether to make your mini discoverable to everyone or only to people 
in your contacts. AirDrop works only with fourth-generation iPads or 
later, the iPad mini, or Mac computers with OS X Yosemite or later.
	
✓	Message: Send a link to the web page in a text or an iMessage.
	
✓	Mail: The Mail program opens with a link for the page in the message 
and the name of the site or page in the Subject line.
	
✓	Twitter: The iPad adds to an outgoing tweet a link to the web page. You 
must fill in the rest of the actual post.
	
✓	Facebook: Post the page — and whatever comments you choose to 
add — to the popular social network.
Figure 4-9: Hold your finger 
against a picture in Safari to 
save it to the mini.

Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
✓	Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo: If available, you post via these Chinese 
blogging services. You need to activate a Chinese keyboard or language 
to see these options.
	
✓	Print: The iPad searches for an AirPrint printer. If you have one, you can 
choose the number of copies you want. Tap Print to complete the job.
Launching a Mobile Search Mission
Most of us spend a lot of time using search engines. And the ones we 
summon most often are Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Bing, at least in the 
United States. If you’re in China, chances are you search using Baidu. All 
these search options are available on the iPad, along with DuckDuckGo, a 
search engine that doesn’t track your web footsteps.
With iOS 7, Apple brought the previously separate address bar and search 
fields together into a single convenient, unified strip called the smart search 
field, following the path taken on most popular web browsers for PCs and 
Macs. Although you can certainly use the virtual keyboard to type google.
com, yahoo.com, bing.com, or other search engines into this field, Apple 
doesn’t require that tedious effort. Instead, just type your search query 
directly in the box.
To conduct a web search on the 
iPad, tap the smart search field. 
You immediately see icons for your 
favorite web destinations, with Apple 
betting on your frequent return 
visits. But when you start typing in 
the smart search field, a Google (or 
other) search mission commences, 
with top hits — an educated guess, 
really — shown at the top.
You see other search suggestions as 
you start tapping additional letters. 
In Figure 4-10, for example, typing 
the letters le yields such sugges-
tions as Lexmark, LeBron James, and 
league of legends. Tap any search 
results that look promising, or tap 
Go on the keyboard to immediately 
land on the top hit. Or keep tapping 
out letters until you generate the 
search result you want.
Figure 4-10: Running a search on the iPad.

81
 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
	
You can also find a search word or phrase on the web page you have on-screen. 
Just look in the list for On This Page. You’re informed of the number of matches; 
if it’s more than one, you can move back and forth through them with the right-
pointing and left-pointing arrows, respectively, at the bottom of the screen.
	
To switch the search field from the current search engine to another search 
engine choice on your iPad, check out the “Smart Safari Settings” section, 
later in this chapter.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Siri can open Safari — all you have to 
do is ask. We also mentioned that Siri can (in some cases, anyway) take you 
to your favorite search engine, just by you uttering the name of a website. Of 
course, much of what Siri can do is web-centric. So now is as good a time as 
any to recommend Chapter 14, where you get an excellent sense of all that 
Siri can do.
	
You conduct a web search also by initiating a Spotlight search. To summon 
the Spotlight search field, swipe down from any Home screen. Type (or dic-
tate) your search term and then scroll to the bottom of the list below any 
search results that point to the use of the term on the iPad itself (meaning 
inside messages, notes, apps, and so on). Tap Search Web to search the web 
with the term you entered, or tap Search Wikipedia to run that search inside 
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia.
	
With iOS 8, Apple added the Spotlight Suggestions feature, which gives you 
potentially useful information even if you don’t explicitly search for it. If you 
search the name of a movie, for example, Safari will also provide showtimes 
at nearby theaters without being asked. If you’re not comfortable with this 
feature, you can turn it off in Settings. And why wouldn’t you be comfortable? 
When you use Spotlight Suggestions, your search queries and related data 
are shared with Apple. Speaking of which . . .
Private Browsing
Don’t want to leave any tracks while you surf? Don’t worry — we won’t ask 
and we won’t tell. Turn on private browsing for a “what happens in Safari 
stays in Safari” tool. Those truly bent on staying private will also want to tap 
Clear History, as we mention earlier in this chapter.
To go incognito, tap the view open tabs icon (refer to Figure 4-1), and then 
tap the Private button at the upper-right corner of the screen. After private 
browsing is on, any traces of your visit to nonono.com (or wherever) are 
nowhere to be found. Your history is wiped clean, open tabs don’t appear 
in iCloud tabs, and your autofill information is not stored anywhere. To 
remind you that you’re browsing privately, the Safari interface takes on a 
darker shade — a not-so-subtle message here, we suppose, that you might be 

82
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
engaging in a shady or naughty activity. We don’t pass judgment. Besides, we 
assume that you’re just a private soul, and we certainly respect that.
To come out of hiding, tap the view open tabs icon again and then tap Private 
again.
	
The history of pages you’ve visited can be useful and a huge timesaver, so 
don’t forget to disable this option again when you’re finished doing whatever 
it is you don’t want people to know you’re doing.
You can separately turn on a Do Not Track setting in Settings. Speaking of 
which, kindly move on to the next section.
Smart Safari Settings
Along with the riches galore found on the Internet are places in cyberspace 
where you’re hassled. You might want to take action to protect your privacy 
and maintain your security.
To get started, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap Safari.
The following settings enable you to tell your mini what you want to be pri-
vate and how you want to set your security options:
	
✓	Search Engine: Tap the search engine you desire (just as long as that 
search engine happens to be Google, Yahoo!, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or 
Baidu).
	
✓	Passwords & AutoFill: Safari can automatically fill out web forms by 
using your personal contact information, usernames, and passwords, or 
information from your other contacts. Tap AutoFill and then tap the on/
off switch to enable or disable AutoFill.
	
•	Tap Use Contact Info if you’re comfortable using the information 
found about your Contacts.
	
•	Tap My Info to select yourself in your contacts so that Safari knows 
which address, phone numbers, email addresses, and other infor-
mation to use when it fills in a form.
	
•	Tap the Names & Passwords on/off switch to enable or disable, 
respectively, Safari’s capability to remember usernames and pass-
words for websites. You also get to decide whether credit card 
information can be used and saved.
	
•	Tap Saved Passwords and enter your iPad password to manage the 
passwords you use at particular websites.
	
•	Tap Credit Cards to manage and enter the credit card numbers 
you’re comfortable sharing.

83
 Chapter 4: Going on a Mobile Safari
	
	Turning on AutoFill can compromise your security if someone gets hold 
of your iPad.
	
✓	Open New Tabs in Background: If you enable this setting, new tabs 
that you open in Safari will load even if you’re reading a different page in 
another tab.
	
✓	Show Favorites Bar: Apple lets you quickly access favorite book-
marks when you enter an address, search, or create a tab. If you’re 
cool with this, leave the default setting as Favorites. If you enable the 
Show Favorites Bar option, you’ll be able to see Safari’s bookmarks bar 
between the smart search field and tab bar.
	
✓	Show Tab Bar: You can display the open tab buttons in a bar near the 
top of the Safari display or not, another matter of personal preference.
	
✓	Block Pop-ups: Pop-ups are those web pages that appear whether or not 
you want them to. Often, they’re annoying advertisements. But on some 
sites, you welcome the appearance of pop-ups, so remember to turn off 
blocking under such circumstances.
	
✓	Quick Website Search: Determine whether or not to use website short-
cuts when you’re searching within a website. For example, you can type 
wiki FDR to show Wikipedia entries for Franklin Roosevelt.
	
✓	Preload Top Hit: We’ve been talking about the smart search field 
throughout this chapter. Here you get to choose whether the iPad can 
provide search engine suggestions, or preload the top hit, or both.
	
✓	Block Cookies: We’re not talking about crumbs you may have acciden-
tally dropped on the mini. Cookies are tiny bits of information that a 
website places on the iPad when you visit so that the site recognizes 
you when you return. You need not assume the worst; most cookies are 
benign.
	
	If this concept wigs you out, you can take action and block cookies from 
third parties and advertisers: If you tap the Always Block option, you 
will theoretically never again receive cookies on the mini. Or you can 
choose to accept cookies only from the website you’re currently visiting 
or only from the websites you happen to visit. You can also tap Always 
to accept cookies from all sites. Tap Safari to return to the main Safari 
Settings page.
	
	If you set the mini so that it doesn’t accept cookies, certain web pages 
won’t load properly, and other sites such as Amazon won’t recognize 
you or make any of your preferred settings or recommendations 
available.
	
✓	Do Not Track: As the name suggests, if you turn this setting on, the iPad 
will not trace your cyberfootsteps.
	
✓	Clear History and Website Data: Tap this option to erase everything in 
Safari’s history, leaving nary a trace of the pages you’ve visited.

84
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
✓	Fraudulent Website Warning: Safari can warn you when you land on a 
site whose producers have sinister intentions. The protection is better 
than nothing, but don’t let down your guard because the Fraud Warning 
feature isn’t foolproof. The setting is on by default.
	
✓	JavaScript: Programmers use JavaScript to add various kinds of func-
tionality to web pages, from displaying the date and time to changing 
images when you drag over them. However, some security risks have 
also been associated with JavaScript. If you do turn it off, though, some 
things might not work as you expect. But this setting is found under the 
Advanced topic for a reason, meaning that Apple doesn’t think too many 
of us should mess with this setting. We generally leave things as they 
are, but go with whatever makes you comfortable.
	
✓	Advanced: Although the Advanced settings are indeed advanced (see 
the preceding bullet), you might want to drop by if you’re curious about 
how much data you’re consuming at different sites. Developers might 
also want to check out Advanced settings to turn on a Web Inspector 
feature that most readers need not concern themselves with.

The Email Must Get Through
In This Chapter
▶	Setting up your accounts
▶	Reading and managing email messages
▶	Searching for email messages
▶	Sending email messages
▶	Setting email preferences
▶	Using the Messages app
▶	Lending your voice to iMessages
O
 
n any computing device, emails come and go with a variety of ­emotions. 
Messages may be amusing or sad, frivolous or serious. Electronic 
­missives on the iPad are almost always touching.
The reason, of course, is that you’re touching the display 
to compose and read messages. Okay, so we’re having 
a little fun with the language. But the truth is, the 
bundled Mail app on the iPad mini is a modern pro-
gram designed not only to send and receive text 
email messages but also to handle rich HTML email 
messages — formatted with font and type styles 
and embedded graphics. If someone sends you mail 
with a picture, it’s quite likely that the picture is 
visible right in the body of the message. (That’s the 
default behavior, but your results may vary depend-
ing on the sender’s email capabilities and your iPad’s 
mail settings.)
Furthermore, your iPad mini can read several types of file 
attachments, including (but not limited to) PDFs, JPG images, 
Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spread-
sheets, as well as stuff produced through Apple’s own iWork software. Better 
still, all this sending and receiving of text, graphics, and documents can 
happen in the background, so you can surf the web or play a game while your 
iPad quietly and efficiently handles your email behind the scenes.

86
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Apple even lets you grant VIP status to important senders so that there’s 
almost no chance you’ll miss mail from the people who matter most. Let’s 
see, there’s your spouse, your kids, your boss . . . are we missing anybody?
Prep Work: Setting Up Your Accounts
First things first. To use Mail, you need an email address. If you have broad-
band Internet access (that is, a cable modem, FiOS, or DSL), you probably 
received one or more email addresses when you signed up. If you’re one of 
the handful of readers who doesn’t already have an email account, you can 
get one for free from Yahoo! (http://mail.yahoo.com), Google (http://
mail.google.com), AOL (www.aol.com), or numerous other service 
providers.
Or you can get a free premium email account (for example, yourname@
iCloud.com) from Apple as part of iCloud. From your Home screen, just tap 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪iCloud.
	
Many free email providers add a bit of advertising at the end of your outgoing 
messages. If you’d rather not be a billboard for your email provider, either 
use the address(es) that came with your broadband Internet access 
(yourname@comcast.net or yourname@att.net, for example) or pay a 
few dollars a month for a premium email account that doesn’t tack advertis-
ing (or anything else) onto your messages.
Finally, while the rest of the chapter focuses on the Mail app, you can also 
use Safari to access most email systems, if that’s your preference.
Setting up your account the easy way
Chapter 3 explains the option of automatically syncing the email accounts 
on your Mac or Windows PC with your iPad mini. If you chose that option, 
your email accounts should be configured already on your iPad. And if you 
signed in with an iCloud account while setting up your iPad (read Chapter 2), 
you should already be good to go with your iCloud email account. You may 
proceed directly to the later section “See Me, Read Me, File Me, Delete Me: 
Working with Messages.”
	
If you haven’t yet chosen that option but want to set up your account the 
easy way now, go to Chapter 3, read about syncing email accounts, and then 
sync your iPad with your Mac or PC. Then you, too, can proceed directly to 
the section “See Me, Read Me, File Me, Delete Me: Working with Messages,” 
later in this chapter.
Remember that syncing email accounts doesn’t have any effect on your email 
messages; it merely synchronizes the settings for email accounts so you don’t 
have to set them up manually on your iPad.

87
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
Setting up your account the less-easy way
If you don’t want to sync the email accounts on your Mac or PC, you can set 
up an email account on your iPad manually. It’s not quite as easy as clicking a 
box and syncing your iPad, but it’s not rocket science either. Here’s how you 
get started:
	
✓	If you have no email accounts on your iPad: The first time you 
launch Mail, you see the Welcome to Mail screen. Your choices are 
iCloud, Microsoft Exchange (business email), Google (Gmail), Yahoo!, 
AOL, Microsoft Outlook.com, and Other.
	
	Merely tap the account type you want to add to the iPad and follow the 
steps in the upcoming “Setting up an account with another provider” or 
“Setting up corporate email” section.
	
✓	If you have one or more email 
accounts on your iPad and want 
to add a new account manually: 
Tap Settings on the Home screen 
and then tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars➪Add Account.
	
	You see an Add Account screen 
shown in Figure 5-1, with the 
same account options that 
appear on the Welcome to Mail 
screen. Proceed to one of the 
next three sections, depending 
on the type of email account 
you selected.
Setting up an email account 
with iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo!, 
AOL, or Microsoft Outlook
If your account is with iCloud, Gmail 
(Google), Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the appropriate button on the Welcome to Mail screen (refer to 
Figure 5-1).
	
2.	Enter your name, email address, password, and optional description, 
as shown in Figure 5-2.
	
	 If you don’t add a description (such as Work or Personal), the field usu-
ally fills in automatically with the contents of the address field.
	
3.	Tap the Next button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
	 You’re finished. That’s all there is to setting up your account. You can now 
proceed to “See Me, Read Me, File Me, Delete Me: Working with Messages.”
Figure 5-1: Tap a button to set up an account.

88
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
On June 30, 2012, Apple completed 
the transition from MobileMe to 
iCloud. Apple says that if you had an 
active MobileMe account when you 
signed up for iCloud, you can keep 
your me.com or mac.com email 
address and any email aliases you’ve 
created.
Setting up an account 
with another provider
If your email account is with a 
provider other than iCloud, Gmail 
(Google), Yahoo!, AOL, or Microsoft 
Outlook, you have a bit more work ahead of you. You need a bunch of infor-
mation about your email account that you may not know or have handy.
We suggest that you scan the following instructions, note the items you don’t 
know, and go find the answers before you continue. To find the answers, 
look at the documentation you received when you signed up for your email 
account or visit the account provider’s website and search there.
Here’s how you set up an account:
	
1.	Starting at the Home 
screen, tap Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars➪Add 
Account➪Other.
	
2.	Under Mail, tap Add Mail 
Account.
	
3.	Fill in the name, address, pass-
word, and description in the 
appropriate fields, and then 
tap Next.
	
	 With any luck, that’s all you’ll 
have to do. The iPad will look 
up and retrieve your account 
credentials. If that doesn’t 
happen, continue with Step 4.
	
4.	Tap the button at the top of the 
screen that denotes the type 
of email server this account 
uses, IMAP or POP, as shown 
in Figure 5-3.
	
5.	Fill in the Internet hostname for your incoming mail server, which 
looks something like mail.providername.com.
Figure 5-2: Just fill ’em in and tap Next, and 
you’re ready to rock.
Figure 5-3: If you set up an IMAP or a POP 
email account, you may have a few more fields 
to fill in before you can rock.

89
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
6.	Fill in your username and password.
	
7.	Enter the Internet hostname for your outgoing mail server, which 
looks something like smtp.providername.com.
	
8.	Enter your username and password in the appropriate fields.
	
9.	Tap the Next (or Save) button in the upper-right corner to create the 
account.
	
	 You’re now ready to begin using your account. See the section “See Me, 
Read Me, File Me, Delete Me: Working with Messages.”
	
Some outgoing mail servers don’t need your username and password. The 
fields for these items on your iPad mini note that they’re optional. Still, we 
suggest that you fill them in anyway. Doing so saves you from having to add 
them later if your outgoing mail server does require an account name and a 
password, which almost all do these days.
Setting up corporate email
The mini makes nice with the Microsoft Exchange servers that are a staple in 
large enterprises, as well as many smaller businesses.
What’s more, if your company supports Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, you 
can exploit push email so that messages arrive pronto on the iPad, just as 
they do on your other computers. (To keep everything up to date, the iPad 
also supports push calendars and push contacts.) For push to work with an 
Exchange Server, your company must be simpatico with one of the last sev-
eral iterations of Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. If you run into a problem, 
ask your company’s IT or tech department.
Setting up Exchange email isn’t particularly taxing, and the iPad connects 
to Exchange right out of the box. However, you might have to consult your 
employer’s techie-types for certain settings.
Start setting up your corporate email on your iPad by following these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Exchange listing on the Welcome to Mail or Add Account 
screen. (Refer to Figure 5-1.)
	
2.	Fill in what you can: your email address, domain, username (some-
times domain\user), and password. Or call on your IT staff for assis-
tance. Tap Next when you’re done.
	
3.	On the next screen, as shown in Figure 5-4, enter the Server email 
address, assuming that the Microsoft Autodiscover service didn’t 
already find it. Tap Next when you’re done.
	
	 That server address may begin with exchange.company.com.
	
4.	Choose which information you want to synchronize through Exchange 
by tapping each item you want.

90
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
	 You can choose Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars, and Reminders. 
When one of these switches is 
turned on, it turns green, as in 
Figure 5-5; otherwise, what you 
see appears dimmed.
	
5.	Tap Save.
	
The company you work for doesn’t 
want just anybody having access to 
your email — heaven forbid if your 
iPad mini is lost or stolen. So your 
bosses may insist that you change 
the passcode lock in Settings on your 
iPad. (The passcode lock is different 
than your email account password.) 
Skip over to Chapter 15 to find 
instructions for adding or changing a 
passcode. (We’ll wait for you.) Now if 
your mini ends up in the wrong 
hands, your company can remotely 
wipe the contents clean.
	
You can choose how long you want 
the iPad to keep email synchronized. 
Head to Settings; tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars; and then tap the email 
account that uses ActiveSync. Tap 
Mail Days to Sync, and tap No Limit 
or choose another time frame (1 day, 
3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month).
	
If you’re moonlighting at a second 
job, it’s good to know that you can 
configure more than one Exchange 
ActiveSync account on your iPad.

Now that your email accounts are all set up, it’s time to figure out how to 
receive and read the stuff. Fortunately, you’ve already done most of the 
heavy lifting when you set up your email accounts. Getting and reading your 
mail are a piece of cake.

 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
You can tell when you have unread mail by looking at the Mail icon at the bottom 
of your Home screen. The cumulative number of unread messages across all 
your email inboxes appears in a little red badge in the upper-right area of the 
icon. If you have many unread messages, you may see the number appear as 4..6 
(signifying, say, 46,376 messages — yes, we get lots of mail).
	
The badge display is the default behavior. If you don’t care for it, you can 
turn it off in the Settings app’s Notifications pane.
In the following sections, you find out how to read messages and attached 
files and send messages to the trash or maybe a folder when you’ve read 
them. Or, if you can’t find a message, check out the section on searching your 
email messages. Reading email on an iPad mini versus a desktop or notebook 
computer is similar, except you have the advantage of the iPad’s touchscreen.
Reading messages
To read your mail, tap the Mail icon on the Home screen. Remember that 
what appears on-screen depends on whether you’re holding the mini in land-
scape or portrait mode as well as what was on the screen the last time you 
opened the Mail app:
	
✓	Landscape: With the iPad in landscape mode, you see All Inboxes at 
the top of the Mailboxes section (see Figure 5-6), which, as its name 
suggests, is a repository for all the messages across all your accounts. 
The number to the right of All Inboxes (50,852 in Figure 5-6) matches 
the number (or abbreviated shortcut) on the Mail icon on your home 
page. Again, it’s the cumulative tally of unread messages across all your 
accounts.
	
	Below the All Inboxes listing are the inboxes for your individual 
accounts. The number to the right of them, as you’d expect, is the 
number of unread messages in those accounts (799 in iCloud and 50,053 
in Gmail, in the example shown in Figure 5-6).
	
	If you tap an account, you see the available subfolders for that account 
(Drafts, Sent Mail, Trash, and so on).
	
	One of these accounts is the VIP mailbox. The VIP mailbox lists all the 
messages from senders you deem the most important. We tell you how 
to give someone VIP status in the later section, “More things you can do 
with messages.”
	
	Depending on the last time the Mail app was open, you may alternatively 
see previews of the messages in your inbox in the left panel. Previews 
show the name of the sender, the time the message arrived, the subject 
header, and the first two lines of the message. (In Settings, you can 
change the number of lines shown in the preview from one line to five or 
to no preview lines.)

92
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Figure 5-6: When you’re holding the mini sideways, Mail looks something like this.
	
✓	Portrait: When you hold the 
iPad in portrait mode, as shown 
in Figure 5-7, the last incoming 
message fills the entire screen. 
You have to tap the Inbox 
button (in the upper-left corner 
of the screen) to summon 
a panel that displays other 
accounts or message previews. 
You can summon the panel also 
by swiping from the left edge 
of the screen to the right. The 
panel overlays the message that 
otherwise fills the screen.
Messages display in threads, or con-
versations, making them easy to 
follow. Of course, you can still view 
accounts individually. Follow these 
steps to read your email:
	
1.	If the email mailbox you want 
to see isn’t front and center, 
tap the Mailboxes button in the 
upper-left corner of the screen 
to summon the appropriate one.
Figure 5-7: When you’re holding the mini in 
portrait mode, the message fills the screen.

93
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
	 Again, this button may say All Inboxes, Mailboxes, or some other folder 
name, or it may say the name of the email account that is currently 
open. Within an email account, you can see the number of unread mes-
sages in each mailbox.
	
2.	(Optional) To summon new messages, swipe down the left panel that 
lists your accounts or mailboxes and immediately release.
	
	 If you see a spinning gear, the iPad is searching for new mail.
	
3.	Swipe down one of the inboxes or accounts to refresh that specific 
mailbox. To summon the unified inbox, tap All Inboxes instead.
	
	 If a blue dot appears next to a message, the message hasn’t been read.
	
4.	Tap a message to read it.
	
5.	When you’ve finished reading, tap the Mailboxes button in the upper-
left corner of the message.
	
	 The button carries a different name, depending on which account you 
have open. For example, it may say Exchange, Inbox, or something else.
	
6.	Read additional messages.
	
	 When a message is on-screen, the buttons for managing incoming mes-
sages appear at the top, most of which you’re already familiar with.
	
•	In portrait mode: Tap the up/down arrow that corresponds to the 
next or previous message, respectively. (Refer to Figure 5-7.)
	
•	In landscape mode (and from within an account): Tap a preview list-
ing to the left of a message to read the next or previous message 
or any other visible message on the list. Scroll up or down to find 
other messages you may want to read.
Threading messages
Apple lets you thread messages, or have Mail automatically group related 
missives. The beauty of this arrangement is that you can easily trace an email 
conversation. When you organize messages by thread, the related messages 
appear as a single entry in the mailbox, with a double right-pointing arrow 
cluing you in that the message is indeed part of a larger ongoing exchange. If 
a message is not part of a thread, you just see the time, day, or date that that 
single message arrived. Figure 5-8 (left) shows that Bob and Melisa are hang-
ing together by a thread — tapping the listing reveals underlying messages 
that make up the conversation. When you tap the message preview, you see 
previews of those underlying messages, as shown in Figure 5-8 (right).
When you look at a message that’s part of a thread, the numbers at the top 
of the screen (visible in portrait mode) tell you the message’s location in the 
conversation. For example, in Figure 5-8 (right), the message we chose to 
read is number 1 of 3 in this thread.

94
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Figure 5-8: Your emails are hanging together by a thread.
To turn on threading, go to the Home screen and 
tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then 
tap on Organize by Thread so that green is visible, 
as shown in Figure 5-9. You may have to scroll 
down to see the Organize by Thread setting.
	
You can search for an item in the thread by scroll-
ing to the top of the thread’s Mail listing and 
typing your query in the search thread box. 
Consider this a prelude to an upcoming section 
on searching email messages.
Managing messages
Managing messages typically involves either moving the messages to a folder 
or deleting them. To herd your messages into folders, you have the following 
options:
	
✓	To create a folder to organize messages you want to keep: Tap an account 
under the Accounts listings on the left side of the screen, and tap Edit. Tap 
New Mailbox, and type a name for the mailbox and location for it.
Figure 5-9: Organize by Thread 
keeps related messages 
together.

95
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
✓	To file a message in another folder: Tap the move message icon 
(labeled in Figure 5-6). When the list of mailboxes appears, tap the folder 
where you want to file the message. Watching the message fly and land 
in the designated new folder is cool.
	
✓	To read a message that you’ve filed: Tap the folder where the mes-
sage now resides and then tap the header or preview for the message in 
question.
	
✓	To delete, move, 
or mark multiple 
messages: Tap Edit. 
In both portrait 
and landscape, Edit 
appears at the top 
of your inbox or 
another mailbox 
when those mail 
folders are selected. 
Tap Edit, and it 
becomes a Cancel 
button, and Mark All, 
Move, and Trash but-
tons appear at the 
bottom of the list. 
Tap each message 
you want to select 
so that a check mark 
appears at that point; Mark All becomes Mark, as shown in Figure 5-10.
	
•	Tap Trash to delete all selected messages.
	
•	Tap Move to move all selected messages to another folder in the 
same or another Mail account, and then tap the new folder or mail-
box (or both) in which you want those messages to hang out.
	
•	Tap Mark to mark all selected messages as Read (and Unread) and 
Flagged (and Unflagged).
	
✓	To delete a single message: Tap the delete message (trash can) icon. In 
case you tap the delete message icon by mistake, you have a chance to 
cancel, provided the Ask before Deleting switch is turned on in Settings.
	
✓	To delete a single message without opening it: Swipe one finger to the 
left across the message in the mailbox list, and then tap the red Delete 
button that appears to the right of the message. (In some accounts, such 
as Gmail, you’ll see an Archive button instead.) You’ll also see a Flag 
option and a More button. Tapping More gives you, well, more options: 
reply to, forward, or flag the message (yes, flag is still an option here); 
mark it as unread, move it to junk or elsewhere, or have the iPad send a 
notification when someone replies to the message or thread.
Figure 5-10: Wiping out, moving, or marking messages, en 
masse.

96
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
As noted, in certain Mail accounts, Gmail being one, the Trash option may be 
replaced by an Archive option, depending on your preference. That means 
you’re not getting rid of a message but stashing it, or to be precise, saving the 
message in your All Mail folder. If the Archive message option does present 
itself, you can turn the feature on or off in Settings.
Searching emails
With Spotlight search, you can quickly and easily search through a bunch of 
messages to find the one you want to read — such as that can’t-miss stock tip 
from your broker. In the search box at the top of a mailbox preview pane, type 
stock or whichever search term seems relevant. All matching emails that have 
already been downloaded appear. And you can run a search to find words 
within the body of an email message from the Mail app. (For more on Spotlight 
search, see Chapter 2.)
Search within Mail is quite powerful. For example, you can search by time 
frame by typing something along the lines of March meetings. Those search 
terms will find all the appropriate messages having to do with meetings that 
month. You can also search to find just flagged messages from your VIPs (flag 
unread VIP).
Via the iPad, you can also search just the current mailbox or across all your 
mailboxes. Just scroll to the top of the mailbox previews pane and tap either 
the All Inboxes tab or the tab for a given mailbox account. Then enter your 
search query in the box at the top of the preview pane.
	
If you’re using Exchange, iCloud, or certain IMAP-type email accounts, you 
may even be able to search messages stored on the server.
Don’t grow too attached to attachments
Your iPad mini can even receive email messages with attachments in a wide 
variety of popular file formats. (See the nearby sidebar “Keeping files in 
order” if you’re not sure what file formats are.) Which file formats does the 
iPad support? Glad you asked:
	
✓	Images: .jpg, .tiff, .gif, .png
	
✓	Microsoft Word: .doc, .docx
	
✓	Microsoft PowerPoint: .ppt, .pptx
	
✓	Microsoft Excel: .xls, .xlsx
	
✓	Web pages: .htm, .html

97
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
✓	Apple Keynote: .key
	
✓	Apple Numbers: .numbers
	
✓	Apple Pages: .pages
	
✓	Preview and Adobe Acrobat: .pdf
	
✓	Rich Text: .rtf
	
✓	Text: .txt
	
✓	Contact information: .vcf
	
If the attachment is a file format that the iPad mini doesn’t support (for exam-
ple, an Adobe Photoshop .psd file), you see the name of the file, but you can’t 
open it on your iPad, at least without an assist from a third-party app that 
you may have installed.
Here’s how to read a supported attachment:
	
1.	Open the email that contains the attachment, which you can identify 
by a little paper clip icon.
	
2.	Tap the attachment.
	
	 The attachment typically appears at the bottom of the message, so you 
probably need to scroll down to see it.
	
	 In some cases, the attachment downloads to your iPad and opens auto-
matically. In other instances, you may have to tap the button represent-
ing the attachment to download it.
	
3.	Read or (in the case of a picture) eyeball the attachment.
	
4.	Tap the attachment you’re reading (in the case of a document), and 
tap Done to return to the message text.
	
	 Or you can (again, for a document) open the Pages word processor if 
you’ve purchased it or downloaded it free if you bought a device with 
iOS 7 or iOS 8. You can also open the doc in certain other apps you may 
have. Incidentally, the documents you create in the Pages app are auto-
matically saved to your iPad. With the latest version of Pages, you can 
also save a document to iCloud, where it can be made available automat-
ically to the version of Pages for Mac computers. If you have a Windows 
PC, you can work with an iCloud version of Pages.
	
You can open an attachment from a different app than the one summoned to 
duty. Just touch and hold down on the attachment in the email, and then tap 
the app from the options that present themselves. You may also be able to 
tap Quick Look to peek at the attachment.

98
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
More things you can do with messages
Wait! You can do even more with your incoming email messages:
	
✓	To see all recipients of a message: Tap More, which appears to the right 
of the recipients’ name, assuming you cannot already see all the names 
of the people receiving the message.
	
	If all recipients are displayed, you’ll see Hide instead of More; tap Hide 
to hide all names except the sender’s.
	
✓	To add an email recipient or sender to your contacts: Tap the name 
or email address at the top of the message and then tap Create New 
Contact or Add to Existing Contact.
	
✓	To make a sender a VIP: Tap the name or email address at the top of 
the message and then tap Add to VIP. You may want to give VIP status 
to the important people in your life, such as your significant other, 
family members, boss, or doctor. A star appears next to any incoming 
­messages from a VIP. You can summon mail from all your VIPs by tap-
ping the VIP folder in the list of Mailboxes. To demote a VIP to an NVIP 
(not very important person), tap the name or email at the top of the 
message and then tap Remove from VIP.
	
✓	To mark a message as unread, flag it, move it to junk, or arrange to 
receive a notification when someone replies: Tap the flag icon at the 
top of a message. These options appear:
	
•	Mark as Unread: Choose Mark as Unread for messages that you may 
want to revisit at some point but which don’t necessarily have spe-
cial significance. The message is again included in the unread mes-
sage count on the Mail icon on your Home screen, and its mailbox 
again has a blue dot next to it in the message list for that mailbox. 
Keeping files in order
In simple terms, computers of any type, includ-
ing tablets like the iPad — and the software 
that runs on them — must have some way to 
recognize the files that run on the system and 
to act appropriately upon them. Long ago, the 
bright minds in technology cooked up standard 
ways to organize the layout of data so files that 
serve a particular purpose adhere to a similar 
structure. You recognize such files by the file-
name extension, the suffix that is separated by 
a dot, or period, after its name. Many more file 
formats exist than most folks will ever need to 
become familiar with. But you — or, more pre-
cisely, the hardware and software you’re work-
ing with — will encounter some popular file 
types repeatedly. Such formats include .doc for 
Microsoft Word documents and .jpg for images. 
If any computer you’re using encounters files 
that don’t seem to open or respond, it’s likely 
because the machine doesn’t have the soft-
ware to recognize such files. The good news is 
that the iPad supports most common file types 
it encounters.

99
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
You can tap Mark as Read if the message loses its significance. As 
an alternative, you can mark a message as unread by swiping from 
left to right in the preview pane.
	
•	Flag: Choose Flag for those messages that deserve special status or 
that you want to find again in a hurry.
	
•	Move to Junk: We all get crap email. This option moves those mes-
sages to your junk pile.
	
•	Notify Me: Tap to receive notifications whenever anyone replies to 
this email thread.
	
✓	To zoom in on and out of a message: Use the pinch and unpinch ges-
tures, at which we suspect you now excel. See Chapter 2 if you need help 
with your touchscreen moves.
	
✓	To follow a link in a message: Tap the link. Links are typically displayed 
in blue, but they sometimes appear in other colors, or underlined, or 
both. If the link is a URL, Safari opens and displays the web page. If the 
link is a phone number, the iPad gives you the chance to add it to your 
contacts, copy it, call it using FaceTime Audio or your iPhone (through 
a Handoff feature added with iOS 8), or send a message. If the link is a 
map, the Maps app opens and displays the location. If you tap a date, 
you can create an event on that date or show it in Calendar. And, last but 
not least, if the link is an email address, a new preaddressed blank email 
message is created.
	
✓	If the link opens Safari, Contacts, or Maps and you want to return to your 
email, press the Home button on the front of your iPad and then tap the 
Mail icon. Or double-press the Home button and select the Mail icon 
from the gallery of running apps.
Darling, You Send Me (Email)
Sending email on your iPad mini is a breeze. You’ll encounter several subspe-
cies of messages: pure text, text with a photo, a partially finished message 
(a draft) that you want to save and complete later, or a reply to an incoming 
message. You can also forward an incoming message to someone else — and 
in some instances print messages. The following sections examine these mes-
sage types one at a time.
Sending an all-text message
To compose a new email message, tap Mail on the Home screen. As before, 
what you see next depends on how you’re holding your mini. In landscape 
mode, your email accounts or email folders are listed in a panel along the 
left side of the screen, with the actual message filling the larger window on 
the right.

100
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Now, to create a message, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Tap the compose new message 
icon (labeled in Figure 5-6).
	
	 The New Message screen 
appears, like the one shown in 
Figure 5-11 (except your new 
message won’t have text typed 
in the message body yet).
	
2.	Type the names or email 
addresses of the recipients 
in the To field, or tap the + 
symbol to the right of the To 
field to choose a contact(s) 
from your iPad’s contacts list.
	
	 If you start typing an email 
address, email addresses that 
match what you typed appear in 
a list below the To or Cc field. If 
the correct one is in the list, tap 
it to use it.
	
3.	(Optional) Tap the field labeled 
Cc/Bcc, From.
	
	 Doing so breaks the field into separate Cc, Bcc, and From fields (refer to 
Figure 5-11).
	
	 The Cc/Bcc label stands for carbon copy/blind carbon copy. Carbon copy 
(a throwback term from another era) is kind of an FYI to a recipient. It’s 
like saying, “We figure you’d appreciate knowing this, but you don’t need 
to respond.”
	
	 When using Bcc, you can include a recipient on the message, but other 
recipients can’t see that this recipient has been included. Bcc is great 
for those secret agent emails! Tap the respective Cc or Bcc field to type 
names. Or tap the + symbol that appears in those fields to add a contact.
	
4.	(Optional) If you tap From, you can choose to send the message from 
any of your email accounts on the fly — assuming that you have more 
than one account set up on the iPad.
	
5.	In the Subject field, type a subject.
	
	 The subject is optional, but it’s considered poor form to send an email 
message without one.
	
6.	In the message area, type your message.
	
	 The message area is immediately below the Subject field. You have 
ample space to get your message across.
Figure 5-11: The New Message screen 
appears, ready for you to start typing the 
recipient’s name.

101
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
	 Apple includes a bunch of landscape-orientation keyboards in various 
apps, including Mail. When you rotate the mini to its side, you can com-
pose a new message using a wider-format virtual keyboard. And with iOS 
8, you can go with an optional third-party keyboard.
	
7.	Tap the Send button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
	 Your message wings its way to its recipients almost immediately. If you 
aren’t in range of a Wi-Fi network or a cellular network when you tap Send, 
the message is sent the next time you’re in range of one of these networks.
Formatting text in an email
One of the goodies in Mail is the capability to format email text by underlining, 
bolding, or italicizing it. First you select the text by pressing your finger against 
the screen until you see the options to select some or all of the text. After 
making your selection, you’ll have various other options: Cut, Copy, Paste, 
BIU, Replace, Quote Level, or Insert Photo or Video. To format text, tap the BIU 
button. Then apply whichever style (bold, italics, underline) suits your fancy.
If you tap Quote Level — another option that appears when you tap the right-
pointing arrow after selecting a word — you can quote a portion of a message 
you’re responding to. Note: Increase Quote Level must be turned on in Settings. 
You can also increase or decrease the indentation in your outgoing message.
If you tap Replace, you are provided with alternative word choices to the 
word that you selected. Tap one of the alternative options to select it.
Sending a photo with an email message
Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. When that’s the case, here’s 
how to send an email message with a photo attached:
	
1.	Tap the Photos icon on the Home screen.
	
2.	Find the photo you want to send.
	
	
3.	Tap the share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen (and shown 
in the margin).
	
4.	Tap the Mail button.
	
	 An email message appears on-screen with the photo already attached. 
The image may appear to be embedded in the body of the message, but 
the recipient receives it as a regular email attachment.
	
	 On the Cc/Bcc line of your outgoing message, you see the size of the 
attached image. If you tap the size of the image shown, a new line 
appears, giving you the option to choose an alternative size among 
Small, Medium, Large, or Actual Size (in other words, keeping what you 

102
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
have). Your choice affects both the visible dimensions and file size of the 
photo (with the actual size of the file as measured in kilobytes or mega-
bytes reported for each possible choice).
	
5.	Choose what size photo you want to send.
	
6.	Address the message and type whatever text you like, as you did for 
an all-text message previously, and then tap the Send button.
You have an alternative way of inserting pictures (or videos) into your outgo-
ing mail messages. In the preceding “Formatting text in an email” section, we 
mention an Insert Photo or Video option that appears after you press your 
finger against the body of a message that you’re composing. Tap Insert Photo 
or Video, tap the album in which the photo (or video) you want to send 
exists, and then tap that photo or video. Tap Use to embed the image and 
proceed with composing.
Saving an email to send later
Sometimes you start an email message but don’t have time to finish it. 
When that happens, you can save it as a draft and finish it some other 
time. Here’s how:
	
1.	Start an email message, as described in one of the previous sections.
	
2.	When you’re ready to save the message as a draft, tap the Cancel 
button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
	
3.	Tap the Save Draft button if you want to save this message as a draft 
and complete it another time.
	
	 If you tap the Delete Draft button, the message disappears immediately 
without a second chance. Don’t tap Delete Draft unless you mean it.
To work on the message again, tap the Drafts mailbox. A list of all messages 
you saved as drafts appears. Tap the draft you want to work on, and it reap-
pears on the screen. When you’re finished, you can tap Send to send it or tap 
Cancel to save it as a draft again.
	
The number of drafts appears to the right of the Drafts folder, the same way 
that the number of unread messages appears to the right of other mail fold-
ers, such as your inbox.
Replying to, forwarding, or  
printing an email message
When you receive a message and want to reply to it, open the message and 
then tap the reply icon (the curved arrow at the upper-right corner of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 5-12). Then tap Reply, Reply All, Forward, or Print, 
as described next:

103
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
✓	Reply and Reply All: The Reply button 
creates an email message addressed to the 
sender of the original message, with the con-
tent of that original message embedded in 
your reply. The Reply All button creates an 
email message addressed to the sender and 
all other recipients of the original message, 
plus Ccs. (The Reply All option appears 
only if more than one recipient was on the 
original email.) In both cases, the subject 
is retained with a Re: prefix added. So if the 
original subject were iPad Tips, the reply’s 
subject would be Re: iPad Tips.
	
✓	Forward: Tapping the Forward button creates an unaddressed email 
message that contains the text of the original message. Add the email 
address(es) of the person or people you want to forward the message 
to, and then tap Send. In this case, rather than a Re: prefix, the subject 
is preceded by Fwd:. So this time, the subject would be Fwd: iPad Tips. 
If the email you’re forwarding has an attachment, you’ll be given the 
option to forward the attachment along with the message.
	
✓	Print: Tap Print if you want to print using an AirPrint-capable printer.
	
It’s considered good form to leave the subject lines alone (with the Re: or 
Fwd: prefix intact), but you may want to change them sometimes. You can 
edit the subject line of a reply or a forwarded message or edit the body text 
of a forwarded message the same way you’d edit any other text. Worth 
noting: When the Re: is modified, a new email thread is created and the modi-
fied message won’t be included in the old thread listing.
To send your reply or forwarded message, tap the Send button as usual.
Settings for sending email
You can customize the mail you send and receive in lots of ways. In this sec-
tion, we explore settings for sending email. Later in this chapter, we show you 
settings that affect the way you receive and read messages. In each instance, 
start by tapping Settings on the Home screen.
You can customize your mail in the following ways:
	
✓	To hear an alert when you successfully send a message: From the 
main Settings screen, tap Sounds. Make sure that the Sent Mail setting 
is turned on. You’ll know because you’ll see a sound type listed (among 
alert sounds and ringtones), Swoosh by default. If you tap Sent Mail in 
Settings, you can select another sound besides Swoosh or choose None 
if going silent is your preference.
Figure 5-12: Reading and 
managing an email message.

Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
	If you want to change other settings, tap the Sounds button at the top of 
the screen. If you’re finished setting the settings, tap the Home button 
on the front of your iPad mini.
	
✓	No matter what setting you’ve just accessed, if you want to continue 
using Settings, tap whichever left-pointing button appears at the top of 
the right Settings pane — General, Mail, Contacts, or something else. 
After you return to the previous screen, you can change other settings. 
Similarly, you can tap the Home button on the front of your iPad when 
you’re finished setting any setting. That action always saves the changes 
you just made and returns to the Home screen.
	
✓	To add a signature line, phrase, or block of text to every email mes-
sage you send: Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then tap 
Signature in the right pane. The default signature is Sent from my iPad. 
You can add text before or after it, or delete it and type something else. 
Your signature is affixed to the end of all your outgoing email. You can 
choose a signature that is the same across all your accounts or select 
different signatures for each account.
	
✓	To have your iPad mini send you a copy of every message you send: 
Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then turn on the Always Bcc 
Myself setting.
	
✓	To set the default email account for initiating email from outside the 
Mail application: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪Default Account. Tap the account you want 
to use as the default. This designated email account is the one that’s 
used when you want to email a picture directly from the Photos app, for 
example. Note that this setting applies only if you have more than one 
email account on your iPad.
Setting Your Message and Account Settings
This final discussion of Mail involves more settings that deal with your vari-
ous email accounts.
Checking and viewing email settings
Several settings affect the way you can check and view email. You might want 
to modify one or more, so we describe what they do and where to find them:
	
✓	To specify how often the iPad mini checks for new messages: Tap the 
Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪Fetch 
New Data. You’re entering the world of fetching or pushing. Check out 
Figure 5-13 to glance at your options. If your email program (or, more 
precisely, the email server behind it) supports push and the Push set-
ting is enabled on your iPad, fresh messages are sent to your mini 
automatically as soon as they hit the server. If you turned off push or 

105
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
your email program 
doesn’t support it, 
the iPad fetches data 
instead. Choices for 
fetching are Every 
15 Minutes, Every 30 
Minutes, Hourly, and 
Manually. Tap the 
one you prefer. With 
push email, mes-
sages can show up 
on the lock screen 
and in Notification 
Center.
	
✓	To hear an alert 
sound when you 
receive a new mes-
sage: Tap Sounds on the main Settings screen and then tap the New Mail 
setting. The Ding sound is there by default. Do nothing if you’re satisfied 
with the Ding you hear each time a new message arrives. If you aren’t 
satisfied, tap New Mail and select an alternative sound from the list, or 
tap None if you don’t want to hear any such alert.
	
✓	To set the number of lines of each message to be displayed in the 
message list: From the main Settings screen, tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars➪Preview; then choose a number. Your choices are None, 1, 
2, 3, 4, and 5 lines of text. The more lines of text you display in the list, 
the fewer messages you can see at a time without scrolling. Think before 
you choose 4 or 5.
	
✓	To specify whether the mini shows the To and Cc labels in message 
lists: From the main Settings screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and 
turn on or off the Show To/Cc Label setting.
	
✓	To turn on or off the Ask before Deleting warning: From the main 
Settings screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; then turn on or off the 
Ask before Deleting setting. If this setting is turned on, you need to tap 
the trash icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the red Delete 
button to confirm the deletion. When the setting is turned off, tapping 
the trash icon deletes the message, and you never see a red Delete 
button.
	
✓	To change swipe options: From the main Settings screen, tap Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars and then tap Swipe Options. You can choose 
whether swiping left (on the preview pane) flags messages and whether 
swiping right marks messages as unread.
	
✓	To change the flag style from a color to a shape: Tap Settings➪Flag 
Style and make your determination.
Figure 5-13: Fetch or push? It’s your call.

106
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
✓	To mark email addresses that originate or are received from a desig-
nated mail server: Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendar➪Mark 
Addresses and flip the switch on. Enter the email address from your 
company (or wherever) that you do not want marked. From then on, 
when you’re composing a message, all email addresses sent to or from 
that specified address will appear in blue, while all other mail addresses 
will be shaded red. Why do this? The idea is that you can more easily 
identify mail dispatched to addresses outside your organization, alerting 
you to a potential security risk if you’re exchanging, say, sensitive 
information.
	
✓	To specify whether the iPad will automatically display images that 
are embedded in an email: Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then tap 
Load Remote Images in the right pane so that the switch is green (on). If 
it’s off, you can still manually load remote images. Certain security risks 
have been associated with loading remote images, and they can also hog 
bandwidth.
	
✓	To organize your mail by thread: Tap Organize by Thread so that the 
setting is on.
Altering account settings
The last group of email settings we explore in this chapter deals with your 
email accounts. You most likely will never need most of these settings, but 
we’d be remiss if we didn’t at least mention them briefly. So here they are, 
whether you need ’em or not:
	
✓	To stop using an email account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home 
screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪Account Name and flip the switch 
so that Mail is turned off. As a reminder, when Mail is on, you see green 
by the Mail switch. Otherwise, the switch is gray.
	
	This setting doesn’t delete the account; it only hides it from view and 
stops it from sending or checking email until you turn it on again. (You 
can repeat this step to turn off calendars, contacts, reminders, and notes 
in a given account.)
	
✓	To delete an email account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen; 
tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪Account Name➪Delete Account➪Delete. 
Tap Cancel if you change your mind and don’t want your account blown 
away, or tap Delete to proceed.
You can find still more advanced Mail settings, reached the same way: Tap 
the Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then 
tap the name of the account with which you want to work.
	
The settings you see under Advanced (sometimes shown as Advanced 
Settings under a specific email account) and how they appear vary by 
account. This list describes some of the settings you might see:

107
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
✓	To specify how long until deleted messages are removed permanently 
from your iPad mini: Tap Advanced➪Remove. In iCloud Mail, your 
choices are Never, After One Day, After One Week, and After One Month. 
Tap the choice you prefer.
	
✓	To choose whether drafts, sent messages, and deleted messages are 
stored on your iPad mini or on your mail server: Tap Advanced and 
then choose the setting under Mailbox Behaviors stored on My iPad 
or stored on the Server. You can decide for drafts, sent messages, and 
trash. If you choose to store any or all of them on the server, you can’t 
see them unless you have an Internet connection (Wi-Fi or cellular). If 
you choose to store them on your iPad, they’re always available, even 
if you don’t have Internet access. Under Mailbox Behaviors, in certain 
circumstances, you also get to determine whether to delete or archive 
discarded messages.
	
✓	We strongly recommend that you don’t change the next two items unless 
you know exactly what you’re doing and why. If you’re having problems 
with sending or receiving mail, start by contacting your ISP (Internet ser-
vice provider), email provider, or corporate IT person or tech depart-
ment. Then change these settings only if they tell you to. Again, these 
settings and exactly where and how they appear vary by account.
	
✓	To reconfigure mail server settings: In the Incoming Mail Server or 
Outgoing Mail Server section of the account settings screen, tap Host 
Name, User Name, or Password and make your changes.
	
✓	To adjust Use SSL, Authentication, IMAP Path Settings, or Server Port: 
Tap Advanced and then tap the appropriate item and make the neces-
sary changes.
And that, as they say in baseball, retires the side. You’re now fully qualified 
to set up email accounts and send and receive email on your iPad. But, as the 
late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was wont to say, there is one more thing . . .
Getting the iMessage
The Messages app lets you exchange iMessages, pictures, contacts, videos, 
audio recordings, and locations with anyone using an Apple iDevice with 
iOS 5 or higher or with a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks, 
or OS X Yosemite.
In the following sections, find out how each of the iMessages features works.
Sending iMessages
To start a new message, tap the Messages icon on the Home screen to launch 
the Messages app and then tap the compose new message icon, the little 
pencil-and-paper icon in the left pane of the screen (on the Messages list).

108
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
At this point, with the To field active and awaiting your input, you can do 
three things:
	
✓	If the recipient is in your contacts list, type the first few letters of the 
name. A list of matching contacts appears. Scroll through it if necessary 
and tap the name of the contact.
	
	The more letters you type, the shorter the list becomes. And after 
you’ve tapped the name of a contact, you can begin typing another name 
so that you can send this message to multiple recipients at once.
	
✓	Tap the blue circled + icon on the right side of the To field to select a 
name from your contacts list.
	
✓	If the recipient isn’t in your contacts list, type his or her phone number 
or email address.
You have a fourth option if you want to compose the message first and 
address it later. Tap inside the text-entry field (the narrow rectangular area 
just above the keyboard and to the left of the Send button or microphone 
icon) to activate the field and then type or dictate your message. When 
you’ve finished typing, tap the To field and use one of the preceding tech-
niques to address your message.
	
You aren’t limited to sending an iMessage to a single person. To initiate a 
group message, type the names or phones numbers of everyone you want to 
include in the To field.
When you’ve finished addressing and composing, tap the Send button to 
send your message on its merry way. And that’s all there is to it.
	
A cool new iOS 8 shortcut comes into play when you’re sending iMessages. If 
you double-press the Home button, you’ll see circular snapshots of the 
people with whom you most recently communicated (above thumbnails of 
your open apps). Tap the circular picture to send the person an iMessage or 
to call the person via FaceTime.
Group messages
The Messages app on your iPad mini is all-inclusive — that is, an iMessage 
need not be one to one. Instead, a group of folks can communicate. Start by 
preparing a message with a single recipient, and then tap the circled + in the 
To field to add people to the conversation from your contacts or manually.
By tapping the Details button, you can add people to an ongoing iMessage 
conversation. You can just as easily remove someone by tapping Details, 
swiping from left to right on the name of the person who is getting the heave-
ho, and then tapping Delete. This works only if at least four folks are in the 
conversation.

109
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
You can give a name to your group conversation from within Details as well. 
In the Group Name field, type the name you have in mind.
Adding voice to an iMessage
	
With iOS 8, you can 
record an audio message 
and send it along to a 
recipient. Apple calls this 
Tap to Talk and here’s 
how to take advantage of 
it. Press and hold down 
the microphone icon to 
the right of the text-entry 
field (not the microphone 
icon on the iPad key-
board) and start speak-
ing. Your voice appears as 
a waveform at the bottom 
of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 5-14. When you’ve 
finished speaking, keep 
your finger pressed down 
and swipe up to send the 
message. You can listen 
to the audio before send-
ing it by tapping the play 
icon, which appears after 
you release the button 
you held down to record. 
If you’re not thrilled with 
what you’ve just 
recorded, swipe left 
instead to cancel.
The recipient of your recorded iMessage will be able to tap a Play button to 
listen to what you had to say. But in some cases, he or she had best listen 
right away because you can set things (in Settings) so that audio messages 
expire after two minutes. Your only other option is for the message to never 
expire.
Keep in mind that the microphone icon that lets you record your voice will 
be enabled only if you’re sending an iMessage to a chat partner.
Figure 5-14: Lending your voice to an iMessage.

Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Being a golden receiver: Receiving iMessages
When determining your settings for receiving iMessages, first things first. 
Decide whether you want to hear an alert when you receive a message:
	
✓	If you want to hear an alert sound when you receive a message: Tap the 
Settings icon on your Home screen, tap Sounds➪Text Tone, and then tap 
an available sound. You can audition the sounds by tapping them. (Ed, a 
film buff, prefers the Noir sound, which is found under Classic sounds.) If 
you have a Mac, you can create your own text tones in GarageBand.
	
	You hear the sounds when you audition them in the Settings app, even if 
the ring/silent switch is set to Silent. After you exit the Settings app, 
however, you won’t hear a sound when a message arrives if the ring/
silent switch is set to Silent.
	
✓	If you don’t want to hear an alert when a message arrives: Instead of 
tapping one of the listed sounds, tap None, which is the first item in the 
list of alert tones.
	
✓	If you don’t want any messages: Turn off iMessages. If you won’t want 
iMessages (or other interruptions) for a designated period, consider 
the Do Not Disturb feature. It lives up to its name. Turn on the feature in 
Settings, and you’ll see a moon icon in the status bar. Even easier, turn 
on Do Not Disturb in Control Center, and you won’t be inundated with 
messages. You can also tap Details in a given message thread to summon 
and turn on Do Not Disturb, which mutes notifications for this particular 
conversation. For more about the Do Not Disturb feature and other set-
tings, head to Chapter 15.
The following pointers explain what you can do with iMessages that you 
receive:
	
✓	When your iPad mini is asleep: All or part of the text and the name of 
the sender appear on the unlock screen, as shown in Figure 5-15. Slide to 
the right to reply to a specific message (you’ll have to get past any pass-
codes first).
	
✓	When your iPad mini is awake and unlocked: All or part of the mes-
sage and the name of the sender appear at the top of the screen in front 
of whatever’s already there. If what’s already there is your Home screen, 
as shown in Figure 5-16, the Messages icon displays the number of 
unread messages.
	
	These notifications are on by default; turn them off in the Settings app’s 
Notifications pane if you don’t care for them. You’ll also see any notifica-
tions for messages you’ve received in Notification Center.
	
✓	Reading or replying to a message: Tap the Messages icon on your 
Home screen, swipe downward from the top of the screen to display 
Notification Center, or tap the notification if you can be quick about it 
(the notification fades away in a few seconds).

111
 Chapter 5: The Email Must Get Through
	
✓	Following the conversation: 
Each conversation you have 
is saved as a series of text 
bubbles. Your messages appear 
on the right side of the screen 
in blue bubbles; the other per-
son’s messages appear in gray 
ones. When your message has 
been delivered, that fact will be 
noted just below the last bubble 
in your exchange, as shown in 
Figure 5-17. If there was a prob-
lem delivering the message, 
you’ll see Not Delivered instead. 
If at first you don’t succeed, try 
again.
	
✓	Forwarding a conversation: If 
you want to forward all or part 
of a conversation to another 
iMessage user, press against a 
text bubble and tap the More 
button. Tap additional text, 
Figure 5-15: Message notifications look like 
this when your iPad mini is slumbering.
Figure 5-16: This is what a notification looks 
like when your iPad mini is awake.
Figure 5-17: This is what an iMessage 
conversation looks like.

112
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
photo, or video bubbles that you want to forward (the one you pressed 
to summon the More button is already selected) so that a check mark 
appears in a circle to the left of each. Then tap the forward (curved 
arrow) icon at the lower right of the screen. The contents of the selected 
text bubbles are copied to a new text message; specify a recipient and 
then tap Send.
	
✓	Deleting part of a single conversation thread: Press against a text 
bubble and tap More. Tap each text bubble that you want to delete; 
a check mark appears in the circle next to each one. Then tap the 
delete (trash can) icon at the bottom of the pane, and tap Delete 
Message(s). Or, to delete the entire conversation in one fell swoop, 
tap the Delete All button at the top of the screen and then tap Delete 
Conversation.
	
✓	Deleting an entire conversation thread: Tap the Edit button at the 
upper left of the Messages list, tap the circle that appears to the left of 
the person’s name, and then tap the Delete button at the bottom of the 
pane. Or swipe from right to left on the message in the Messages pane 
and then tap the red Delete button.
Sending pix and vids in a message
To send a picture or video in a message, follow the instructions for sending 
a text message and then tap the camera icon to the left of the text-entry field 
at the bottom of the screen. You’ll then have the option of using an ­existing 
picture or video or taking a new one. You can also add text to photos or 
videos. When you’re finished, tap the Send button.
But just as you can send an audio message by using the Tap to Talk fea-
ture, you can record and send a video message through a similar shortcut. 
(And as with audio messages, go to Settings to make a video message go 
away after two minutes or to arrange so it doesn’t automatically expire.) 
To record a video message in this manner, press and hold down on the 
camera icon to the left of the text-entry box, and then slide your finger to 
the still camera icon or the video icon that appears to the left of the text. 
Slide your finger to the pop-up control circle and tap the video icon to shoot 
and record your video, and then swipe up to send the video as part of your 
message.
If you receive a picture or video in a message, it appears in a bubble just like 
text (refer to Figure 5-17). Tap the play icon to play it right in Messages. Tap 
again to have the video take over the full screen.
In full-screen mode, tap the share icon in the upper-right corner of a received 
video or picture for additional options, such as sharing the image on 
Facebook or Twitter, assigning it to a contact, or more. If you don’t see the 
icon, tap the picture or video once, and the icon will magically appear.

Smart messaging tricks
Here are some more things you can do with messages:
	
✓	Search your messages for a word or phrase. Type the word or phrase 
in the search field at the top of the Messages screen.
	
✓	Send Read Receipts to allow others to be notified when you have read 
their missives. Tap Settings➪Messages, and slide the switch so that 
Send Read Receipts is on.
	
	In iMessages, you can see when your own message has been delivered 
and read, and when the other person is readying a response.
	
✓	Use a Bluetooth keyboard for typing instead of the on-screen key-
board. Follow the instructions in Chapter 15 to pair your Bluetooth key-
board with your iPad mini.
	
	The Apple Wireless Keyboard ($69) works with the iPad mini and the 
iPhone. Find out more in Chapter 17.
	
✓	Dictate a message. Tap the microphone key on your keyboard and start 
talking. Tap the microphone key again when you’re done. This method 
isn’t as quick or as much fun as Tap to Talk, but it works.
	
✓	Open a URL included in an iMessage. Tap the URL to open that web 
page in Safari.
	
✓	Send an email to an address included in an iMessage. Tap the email 
address in a message to open a preaddressed email message in Mail.
	
✓	See an address included in an iMessage. Tap the address to see it on a 
map in Maps.
	
✓	Choose how you can be reached via iMessage. Tap Settings➪Messages➪ 
Send & Receive. Then add another email address or remove any existing 
addresses. You can also select the email address (or phone number) from 
which to start new conversations.
	
✓	Show the Subject field. Flip the switch to show a Subject field with your 
messages.
	
✓	Block a sender. Block someone who is harassing you or has left your 
good graces. Tap Settings➪Messages➪Blocked and select a name from 
your contacts. You will no longer receive messages or FaceTime calls 
from this person.
	
✓	Share your location. Meeting a recipient in an unfamiliar place? In the 
middle of your conversation, you can share your location on a map. Tap 
the Details button at the upper-right corner and then tap either Send My 
Current Location or Share My Location. Choosing the latter gives you 

114
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
the option to share your whereabouts indefinitely, until the end of the 
day or for one hour. In Details, you can monitor how much time is left 
before your location will no longer be shared.
	
✓	See all the message attachments at once. Tap Details and you can 
browse in one place all the photos and videos from your conversation.
	
✓	Keep Messages history. You can keep your entire Messages his-
tory on the iPad mini permanently, for one year, or for 30 days. Tap 
Settings➪Messages➪Keep Messages and make your choice.
And that’s all there is to it. You are now an official iMessage maven.

Maps Are Where It’s At

▶	Searching
▶	Navigating around by viewing, zooming, and panning
▶	Bookmarking favorites
▶	Getting to where you want to go fast: routes and real-time traffic
W
 
ith Maps on the iPad mini, you can quickly and easily discover 
exactly where you are, find nearby restaurants and businesses, get 
turn-by-turn driving instructions from any address to any other address, 
and see real-time traffic information and a photographic street view of many 
­locations as well.
The Maps app has improved a lot since Apple replaced 
Google Maps with its own homegrown version in iOS 6. 
Apple says it’s “beautifully designed from the ground 
up (and the sky down),” and we have to agree — it’s 
more beautiful than ever. But beyond its good looks, 
zooming in and out is faster than ever, and the 
spoken turn-by-turn navigation with real-time traffic 
updates actually works in most places. Plus it has a 
cool 3D flyover view.
	
You can’t use the Maps app unless you’re con-
nected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, 3G, or 4G. See 
Chapter 2 to find out how to connect.

116
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
Finding Your Current Location with Maps
We start with something supremely simple yet extremely useful — determining 
your current location. At the risk of sounding like self-help gurus, here’s how 
to find yourself:
	
1.	Make sure Location Services is enabled by tapping Settings➪Privacy➪ 
Location Services.
	
	 Tap the Location Services switch to on (green) if necessary.
	
2.	In the list that appears below the switch, tap Maps.
	
3.	Enable Location Services for the Maps app by tapping While Using 
the App.
	
	 A check mark appears on the right to show you that While Using the App 
is selected. The other option, Never, essentially cripples the Maps app, 
so if you select it the rest of the steps aren’t going to work.
	
4.	Tap the Home button to return to the Home screen.
	
5.	Tap the Maps icon on your Home screen.
	
	
6.	Tap the Location 
Services icon in 
the lower-left 
corner of the 
screen.
	
	 The icon’s back-
ground turns 
blue, as shown 
in the margin, 
which assures 
you that Location 
Services is doing 
its thing. You’ll 
soon see a blue 
circle on the map 
(see Figure 6-1), 
which indicates 
your approximate 
location.
	
If you tap, drag the map, or zoom in or out, your iPad continues to update 
your location, but it doesn’t continue to center the marker. That’s a good 
thing, but it also means that the location indicator can move off the screen. If 
that happens, or you move around and the location indicator moves away 
from the middle of the screen, just tap the arrow icon. Your iPad updates 
your location and adjusts the map so your location indicator is in the middle 
of the screen.
Figure 6-1: A blue marker shows your GPS location.

 Chapter 6: Maps Are Where It’s At
Searching
The Maps app wouldn’t be very useful if you couldn’t use it to find things. In 
the following sections, we show you how to search for places you want to go 
and people you want to see — including people stored as contacts.
Finding a person, place, or thing
To find a person, place, or thing with Maps, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the search field at the top of the screen to make the keyboard 
appear, and then type what you’re looking for.
	
	 You can search for addresses, zip codes, intersections, towns, land-
marks, and businesses by category and by name, or in combinations 
such as New York, NY 10022; pizza 60645; or even BBQ Lockhart TX.
	
2.	If the letters you type match names in your contacts list, the matching 
contacts appear in a list below the search field; tap a name to see a 
map of that contact’s location.
	
	 Maps is smart about it, too; it displays only the names of contacts that 
have a street address. See the section “Connecting maps and contacts,” 
later in this chapter, for details.
	
3.	When you finish typing, tap Search.
	
	 After a few seconds, a map appears. If you searched for a single location, 
it’s marked with a pushpin. If you searched for a category (BBQ Lockhart 
TX, for example), you see multiple pushpins, one for each matching loca-
tion, as shown in Figure 6-2.
	
When you tap the search field, a handy drop-down list shows the search 
terms you’ve used recently. Tap any item in the list to search for it again.
How does Maps do that?
Maps uses iPad’s Location Services to deter-
mine your approximate location using available 
information from your wireless data network. 
Wi-Fi–only models use local Wi-Fi networks; 
iPad Wi-Fi + 3G and 4G models use assisted GPS 
plus cellular data. If you’re not using Location 
Services, turning it off conserves the battery. 
(To turn it off, tap Settings➪General➪Location 
Services.) Don’t worry if Location Services is 
turned off when you tap the arrow icon — you’re 
prompted to turn Location Services on. Keep in 
mind that it may not be available in all areas at 
all times.

Connecting 
maps and 
contacts
Maps and contacts go 
together like peanut 
butter and jelly. In this 
section, you discover 
two helpful tasks that 
illustrate maps and con-
tacts at work.
To see a map of a con-
tact’s street address, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap in the search 
field.
	
2.	Tap the Contacts 
button at the 
bottom of the overlay.
	
3.	Tap the contact’s name whose address you want to see on the map.
	
	 Alternatively, type the first 
few letters of a contact’s name 
in the search field, and then 
tap the contact’s name in the 
Suggestions list that appears 
below the search field.
If you find a location by typing an 
address in the search field, you can 
add that location to one of your con-
tacts or create a contact with a loca-
tion you’ve found. To do either one, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the location’s pushpin on 
the map.
	
2.	Tap the little gray right arrow 
to the right of the location’s 
name (labeled in Figure 6-2).
	
	 That contact’s info overlay 
appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Barbecue appears as an overlay.

 Chapter 6: Maps Are Where It’s At
	
3.	Scroll to the bottom of the info overlay and tap Create New Contact or 
Add to Existing Contact, whichever is applicable.
	
4.	Fill in the new contact information and tap Done. Or select an existing 
contact from the list that appears.
	
You work with your contacts by tapping the Contacts icon on your Home 
screen. Go to Chapter 12 to find out more about the Contacts app.
Don’t forget that you can swipe across your iPad mini screen with four or five 
fingers to switch apps. So if you’re in Contacts, a four- or five-finger swipe 
from right to left should bring you back to the Maps app. If you have a lot of 
open apps, you might need more than one swipe to find the Maps app.
And don’t forget that you can also use a four-finger swipe upward or double-
press the Home button to reveal the multitasking screen and switch between 
Contacts and Maps (or any open apps, for that matter).
	
If nothing happens when you swipe with four or five fingers, tap Settings➪ 
General, scroll down to the Multitasking Gestures On/Off switch, and make 
sure it’s on.
You can also get driving or walking directions from most locations, including a 
contact’s address, to any other location, including another contact’s address. 
You see how to do that task in the “Smart Map Tricks” section, later in this 
chapter.
Viewing, Zooming, 
and Panning
The preceding section talks about 
how to find just about anything with 
Maps. Now here’s a look at some 
ways that you can use what you find. 
First, you need to know how to work 
with what you see on the screen. 
Three views are available at any 
time: standard, hybrid, and satellite. 
Select a view by tapping the little i-in-
a-circle in the lower-right corner of 
the screen; an overlay appears with 
the view buttons and several other 
options, as shown in Figure 6-4.
In standard, hybrid, or satellite view, 
you can zoom to see either more or 
less of the map — or scroll (pan) 
Figure 6-4: Tap the little i-in-a-circle to see 
these options.

120
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
to see what’s above, below, or to the left or right of the current screen, as 
follows:
	
✓	Zoom out: Pinch the map or tap using two fingers. To zoom out even 
more, pinch or tap using two fingers again.
	
	The two-finger tap may be new to you. Simply tap with two fingers 
touching the screen simultaneously (rather than the usual one finger).
	
✓	Zoom in: Unpinch the map or double-tap (the usual way — with just one 
finger) the spot you want to zoom in on. Unpinch or double-tap with one 
finger again to zoom in even more. An unpinch (some people refer to this 
gesture as a spread) is the opposite of a pinch. Start with your thumb 
and a finger together and then spread them apart.
	
	You can unpinch also with two hands (using two fingers or two thumbs), 
but you’ll probably find that a single-handed pinch and unpinch are 
handier.
	
✓	Scroll: Flick or drag up, down, left, or right to pan your view of the map.
Tap the little i-in-a-circle in the lower-right corner and then tap Show 3D Map 
to see the map from a three-dimensional bird’s-eye view.
Saving Time with Favorites, 
Recents, and Contacts
In Maps, three tools can save you from typing the same locations repeatedly: 
favorites, recents, and contacts. You see them on the overlay displayed when 
you tap in the search field at the top of the screen. The following sections 
give you the lowdown on these tools.
Favorites
Favorites in the Maps app work like bookmarks in Safari. When you have a 
location you want to save as a favorite so that you can reuse it later without 
typing a single character, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the right arrow to the right of the location’s name or description.
	
	 The info overlay for that location appears. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
	
2.	Tap the share icon at the top-right of the info overlay or tap the Share 
button at the top-right of the screen.
	
3.	Tap Add to Favorites.
After you add a favorite, you can recall it at any time. To do so, tap the text-
entry field as though you were going to search for a location, and then tap 

121
 Chapter 6: Maps Are Where It’s At
Favorites at the top of the overlay that appears. You can then tap the favorite’s 
name to see it on the map.
	
The first things you should make favorites are your home and work addresses 
and their zip codes. You’ll use these all the time with Maps, so you might as 
well add them to Favorites now to avoid typing them over and over.
	
Use zip code favorites to find nearby businesses. Choose the zip code favorite, 
and then type what you’re looking for, such as 78729 pizza, 60645 gas station, 
or 90201 Starbucks.
To manage your favorites, tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the 
favorites overlay. Then:
	
✓	To move a favorite up or down in the list: Drag the little icon with three 
gray bars that appears to the right of the favorite. Drag upward to move 
the favorite higher in the list or downward to move the favorite lower in 
the list.
	
✓	To delete a favorite from the Favorites list: Tap the – sign in a red circle 
to the left of the favorite’s name and then tap the red Delete button.
When you’ve finished using Favorites, tap anywhere outside the overlay to 
return to the map.
By the way, you can drop a pushpin anywhere on a map even if you don’t 
know an exact address or zip code. Think of a pushpin as a temporary 
favorite.
Dropping a pushpin is simple: Press the location where you want the pin to 
appear, and hold down for two or three seconds until the pin appears with 
either Dropped Pin or the street address and a little right arrow. Tap the right 
arrow to see the info overlay, or press and drag the pin to a new location.
To save a dropped pin as a favorite, tap the share icon at the top-right of the 
info overlay or tap the Share button at the top-right of the screen. To remove 
a dropped pin, tap the little right arrow and then tap Remove Pin.
Recents
The Maps app automatically remembers locations you’ve searched for and 
directions you’ve viewed in its recents list. To see this list, tap in the search 
field and then tap the Recents button at the bottom of the overlay. To see a 
recent item on the map, tap the item’s name.
To clear the recents list, tap the Clear button in the upper-left corner of the 
overlay, and then tap the big red Clear All Recents button at the bottom of 
the overlay, or tap Cancel if you change your mind.

122
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
When you’re finished using the recents list, tap anywhere outside the overlay 
to return to the map.
Contacts
To see a list of your contacts, tap in the search field and then tap the 
Contacts button at the bottom of the overlay. To see a map of a contact’s 
location, tap the contact’s name in the list.
To limit the contacts list to specific groups (assuming that you have some 
groups in your contacts list), tap the Groups button in the upper-left corner 
of the overlay and then tap the name of the group. Now only contacts in this 
group are displayed in the list.
When you’ve finished using the contacts list, tap the Done button in the 
upper-right corner of the overlay to return to the map.
Smart Map Tricks
The Maps app has more tricks up its sleeve. Here are a few nifty features that 
you may find useful.
Getting route maps and driving directions
You can get route maps and driving directions to any location from any loca-
tion (within reason; a former tech editor tried to get driving directions from 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC, to 10 Downing Street in London, 
but that didn’t work). Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Tell your iPad mini to get directions for you.
	
	 You can do so in a few ways:
	
•	When you’re looking at a map screen: Tap the Directions button in 
the upper-left corner of the screen. The search field transforms 
into Start and End fields.
	
•	If a pushpin is already on the screen: Tap the pushpin and then tap 
the little i-in-a-circle to the right of the name or description. This 
action displays the item’s info screen. Tap the Directions to Here or 
Directions from Here button to get directions to or from that loca-
tion, respectively.
	
•	Ask Siri for directions: Press and hold the Home button, and ask 
Siri, “How do I get to ____?” (See Chapter 14 for more on Siri.)

123
 Chapter 6: Maps Are Where It’s At
	
2.	Tap in the Start or End field to designate the starting or ending point 
of your trip.
	
	 You can either type the start or end point or choose it from a list of your 
favorites, recent maps, or contacts.
	
3.	(Optional) If you need to swap the starting and ending locations, tap 
the little swirly arrow button between the Start and End fields.
	
4.	(Optional) Tap the car, walking person, or bus icon above the Start 
and End fields to choose driving, walking, or public transportation 
directions.
	
	 Public transportation directions require a third-party app. If you haven’t 
installed one, Maps so informs you and offers to whisk you to the App 
Store with an automated search for public transit apps.
	
5.	When the start and end locations are correct, tap the Route button in 
the upper-right corner of the Directions overlay.
	
	 Suggested routes 
appear on the 
map, as shown in 
Figure 6-5.
	
	 If multiple routes 
exist, Maps shows 
you up to three, 
as in Figure 6-5. To 
switch routes, just 
tap the route you 
want to switch to. 
Note that the text 
at the bottom of 
the screen updates 
to tell you the time 
and distance 
of the selected 
route (42 minutes; 
29.6 miles via US 
Highway 183 S in 
Figure 6-5).
	
6.	If Maps suggests 
several routes, select one by tapping its light blue line or balloon.
	
	 In Figure 6-5, one of the two 42-minute routes is selected.
	
	 Tap the little i-in-a-circle in the lower-right corner of the map you’re 
viewing and then tap the Show Traffic button to help you decide which 
route will be most expedient.

in Austin, Texas, to Black’s Barbecue in Lockhart, Texas.

124
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
	
7.	Tap the Start 
button at the 
bottom of the 
screen to begin 
your directions.
	
	 When you tap 
the Start button, 
a series of stark 
white road signs 
appear across 
the top of the 
map, one for each 
step in the direc-
tions, as shown in 
Figure 6-6.
	
8.	Navigate your 
directions by 
swiping the road signs to the left or right or by choosing from a list:
	
•	Road signs: Swipe right or left on the road signs to see the next or 
previous step in your route. The current step is highlighted and 
a blue circle appears on the map to indicate the location of that 
step. The other (next or previous) steps are dimmed (refer to 
Figure 6-6).
	
•	List: If you 
prefer to see 
your driving 
directions 
displayed as 
a list, tap the 
Overview 
button near 
the top-right 
corner of the 
screen and 
then tap the 
List Steps 
button at the 
bottom of the 
screen, dead 
center. The 
steps appear 
in an overlay, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-6: The road signs show you each step of your route.
Figure 6-7: Step-by-step driving directions displayed as a list.

125
 Chapter 6: Maps Are Where It’s At
	
	The List icon appears on the route screen (refer to Figure 6-5) but 
disappears when you tap Start (refer to Figure 6-6). Remember to 
tap the Overview button to make the list of steps appear.
	
	Tap any step in the list to see that leg of the trip displayed on 
the map.
	
	If you want to return to the road sign directions and map again, tap 
the Resume button in the upper-right corner of the screen or tap 
any step in the list overlay. The list disappears, and the road signs 
and map reappear.
Getting traffic info in real time
You can find out the traffic conditions for the map you’re viewing by tapping 
the little i-in-a-circle in the lower-right corner of the map and then tapping 
Show Traffic. If it says Hide Traffic, don’t tap — the option is already on.
Major roadways are 
color-coded to inform 
you of the current traf-
fic speed, as shown in 
Figure 6-8. Here’s the 
key: Orange dots show 
slowdowns, and red 
dashes show stop-and-
go traffic.
To report an incident, 
tap the little i-in-a-
circle, then tap Report 
a Problem. To see 
an incident report, 
tap a marker on the 
map (none appear in 
Figure 6-8).
	
Traffic info doesn’t work in every location. The only way to find out is to give 
it a try and see whether color codes appear.
Getting more info about a location
If a location has a little right arrow to the right of its name or description 
(refer to Figure 6-2), you can tap it to see additional information about that 
location.
Figure 6-8: Lower Manhattan in midafternoon on a Saturday 
has more traffic than most other cities at rush hour.

126
Part II: The Internet iPad mini 
As we explain earlier in this chapter, you can get directions to or from that 
location, add the location to your favorites or contacts, or create a contact 
from it. With some locations, you can do two more things from the location’s 
info screen:
	
✓	Tap the location’s email address to launch the Mail app and send an 
email to the location.
	
✓	Tap the location’s URL to launch Safari and view the location’s website.

Y
 
our iPad mini is perhaps the best iPod ever — especially for working 
with audio and video. In this chapter, we show you how to use your 
iPad for audio; in Chapter 8, we cover video.
We start with a quick tour of the Music app, followed by tips and techniques 
for using your new audio player. After you’re nice and comfy with 
using it this way, we show you how to customize the listen-
ing experience so that it’s just the way you like it. Then 
we offer a few tips to help you get the most out of using 
your iPad as an audio player. Finally, we show you 
how to use the iTunes Store app to buy music, audio-
books, videos, and free content such as podcasts 
and iTunes U courses.
We assume that your iPad already contains audio 
content — songs, podcasts, or audiobooks. If you 
don’t have audio on your iPad yet, we humbly sug-
gest that you get some before you read the rest of 
this chapter (or Chapter 8, for that matter). You can 
get audio by syncing (flip to Chapter 3 and follow the 
instructions) or buying it from the iTunes Store (see the 
last section in this chapter) on your iPad.
Okay, now that you have some audio content on your iPad mini to play 
with, are you ready to rock?

Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Introducing the iPod inside Your iPad mini
To use your iPad mini as an iPod, tap the Music icon on the right side of the dock 
at the bottom of the screen (unless you’ve moved the Music app elsewhere).
Figure 7-1 provides an overview of the Music app for your enjoyment and 
edification. Because the Songs tab is selected in Figure 7-1, the middle of the 
screen displays the songs available on our iPad.
Figure 7-1: These components are what you find on the Music app’s main screen.
At the top of the screen are the music controls and buttons; at the bottom are 
eight tabs: Radio, Genius, Playlists, Artists, Songs, Albums, Genres, and More. 
If you don’t see these icons, tap the back icon (left-pointing arrow) in the 
upper-left corner of the screen.

131
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
	
If you don’t see every song in your library, chances are you’ve typed some-
thing in the search field or are looking at a shared Music library instead of 
the songs on your iPad.
Along the right side of the screen, you see the letters of the alphabet from A 
to Z. Tap one to jump to that letter instantly when you’re browsing Playlists, 
Songs, Artists, or Albums.
	
If you don’t see the alphabet on the right side of the screen, you may not 
have enough items on that tab to warrant it or you may be looking at a cate-
gory such as Genres (described in the “Browsing among the tabs” section, 
later in the chapter), which doesn’t have an alphabetical index. Don’t worry.
You can find a particular song, artist, album, genre, composer, or audiobook 
by using the search field or by browsing the tabs. The following sections 
show you how.
Note that you no longer use the Music app to enjoy podcasts or iTunes U 
content on your iPad. These days, you’ll need the Podcasts and iTunes U 
apps to play back podcasts or iTunes U courses, respectively. If the apps 
aren’t already on your iPad mini (check the Extras folder), you can get them 
for free in the App Store (see Chapter 11).
iTunes Radio
If you’ve ever listened to a streaming radio service such as Pandora, Spotify, 
or Radical.fm, you’ll grok Apple’s new iTunes Radio immediately.
In a nutshell, iTunes Radio features more than 300 DJ-curated and genre-
focused streaming radio stations. You can also create your own stations 
based on music you love. The more you listen to and fine-tune stations — by 
tapping the Play More Like This or Never Play This Song button (you’ll hear 
more on these important buttons in just a moment) — the more you’ll like 
what the station plays for you.
Did we mention that iTunes Radio is available on the iPhone, iPad, iPod 
touch, Mac, PC, and Apple TV for free? You’ll hear the occasional ad, but if 
you subscribe to iTunes Match ($24.99 a year; see the upcoming sidebar for 
details), you can listen ad-free.
But enough about what it is. Tap the Radio icon at the bottom of the Music 
app, and to start listening, tap a featured station, as shown in Figure 7-2. A 
song begins playing immediately.
Basically, two kinds of stations are available:
	
✓	Featured: iTunes created these stations. You find them at the top of the 
screen; swipe left on the featured stations to see additional choices. 
Note that you can’t customize built-in stations and what you see is 

132
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
what you get. That 
being said, the fea-
tured stations are 
updated frequently 
with new additions.
	
✓	Custom: You create 
these stations, 
and they’re listed 
under the featured 
stations. Although 
featured stations 
are nice to try out, 
custom stations 
are the heart of 
iTunes Radio.
	
	Tap the New button 
to start a station 
of your own. You 
can then search for 
and tap an artist, a 
genre, or a song (or 
any combination), 
and your station is 
created based on 
your choice.
If you ever need to edit 
your custom station, 
tap the red Edit button 
to the left of My Stations 
(refer to Figure 7-2). You 
can rename the station; 
add artists, songs, or 
genres; or delete the 
station from your iPad.
	
Deleting a station on your iPad deletes the station everywhere: from your 
Mac or PC, Apple TV, and other iDevices. If you’ve put a lot of time and effort 
into fine-tuning a station, think twice before you delete it.
Fine-tuning your station
If you want stations you create to play more songs you like, you need to fine-
tune the stations. When a song you love or hate is playing, just tap the little 
star to the left of the play/pause icon, as shown in Figure 7-3. Three options 
slide up from the bottom of the screen.
Figure 7-2: Tap a featured station to listen to it; swipe across 
stations to see additional ones.

133
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
If you love the song, tap Play More 
Like This or Add to iTunes Wish List 
(or both). The star turns red when 
you choose Play More Like This. 
If you hate it, tap Never Play This 
Song, and you’ll never hear it again 
(at least, not on this station). When 
you’re done, tap anywhere outside 
the overlay to dismiss it.
	
	 When you find an item in the iTunes 
Store and want to add it to your wish list, tap the share icon and choose Add 
to Wish List. To view or change your wish list, tap the lists icon in the upper-
right corner (and shown in the margin), and then tap Wish List.
	
You can’t fine-tune songs played on featured stations; you can add them to 
your wish list, but you can’t select Play More Like This or Never Play This 
Song for them.
Using the info overlay
Although you can’t fine-tune featured stations, 
what you can do — and this works with songs 
on both featured and custom stations — is tap 
the little i-in-a-circle near the top of the screen 
to display the song’s info overlay, as shown in 
Figure 7-4.
The info overlay lets you start a new station from 
the artist or song that’s playing, allow or disallow 
explicit content on the station, and share the sta-
tion with friends via the usual methods.
The Tune This Station slider shown in Figure 7-4 
appears only for custom stations; you can’t 
tune a featured station. Adjust the slider to hear 
more hits, get more variety, or discover more 
new artists and tracks. Clear as mud? You can 
also tap the song title (“Here Comes the Sun” in 
Figure 7-4) to see all the tracks on the album in 
the iTunes Store, or tap the price ($1.29 in the 
figure) to purchase the track that’s playing.
	
Even though you can’t tune a featured station, 
you can start your own custom station based on 
a song or an artist you hear on a featured station.
When you’re finished with the info overlay screen, tap anywhere outside the 
overlay to dismiss it.
Figure 7-3: Tap the star, and the fine-tuning 
options appear.

a custom station based on the

Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Finding music with the search field
With the Music app open, the easiest way to find music is to type the song, 
artist, album, or composer name in the search field in the lower-right corner 
of the screen.
	
You can find songs (or artists, for that matter) without opening the Music app 
by typing their names in a Spotlight search, as we mention in Chapter 2. An 
even cooler way to hear music without opening the Music app is to ask Siri to 
play the song, album, or artist. (Chapter 14 gives you the scoop on Siri.)
Browsing among the tabs
If you’d rather browse, not search, your music library, tap the appropriate tab 
at the bottom of the screen — Playlists, Artists, Songs, Albums, and Genres — 
and all items of that type appear. Or you can tap the More button to browse 
Compilations or Composers, or to connect to a shared library, as described 
later in this chapter.
iTunes Match: All your music, all the time,  
on all your devices
iTunes Match is a bargain at $24.99 a year if, 
like Bob, you have over 15,000 songs in your 
iTunes library. That many songs won’t fit on 
most iDevices, so Bob uses iTunes Match, 
which determines which songs in his collection 
are available in the iTunes Store. Because the 
iTunes Store holds more than 37 million songs, 
chances are that most of your music is already 
in iCloud. And for the songs that aren’t, iTunes 
uploads what it can’t match (which is much 
faster than uploading your entire music library).
As a bonus, all the music iTunes matches plays 
back from iCloud at 256 Kbps AAC DRM-free 
quality even if your original copy was lower 
quality. (You can even download higher-quality 
versions of those songs to replace your lower 
bit-rate copies if you care to.)
After your music is in iCloud, you can play it 
from any of your Macs or iDevices. Just browse 
the complete list of all your music stored in the 
cloud and tap to play to it.
You can store up to 25,000 songs in iCloud 
(songs you purchased from the iTunes Store 
don’t count). And only tracks or albums you 
download are stored on your device. Here’s a 
tip: Before going off the grid — on a plane flight 
or cruise — tap the iCloud download button for 
all the music you want to listen to at 30,000 feet 
up or at sea.
All you need is Internet access to have your 
entire music library available on your iPad 
or other device, and you never have to worry 
about storage space on your iPad.
We’d be remiss if we didn’t warn you that unless 
you have an unlimited data plan, you might want 
to disable iTunes Match over cellular by tapping 
Settings➪Cellular, and then scrolling down to 
disable the on-off switch for the Music app. 
iTunes Match is only $24.99 a year, but your data 
surcharges could be a whole lot more if you’re 
not careful.

135
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
After tapping one of these tabs, you can find the playlist, song, artist, album, 
or genre by
	
✓	Flicking upward or downward to scroll up and down the list.
	
✓	Tapping one of the little letters on the right to jump to that letter in the 
list (all categories except Genres).
Then, when you find what you’re looking for, here’s what happens (depending 
on which tab is selected):
	
✓	Playlists: A list of playlists available on this iPad mini appears. Tap a 
playlist and the songs it contains appear in a list. Tap a song to play it.
	
	If you’re not sure which song you want to listen to, try this: Tap the Shuffle 
button at the top of the screen (refer to Figure 7-1). Your iPad mini then 
plays songs from 
your music collection 
at random.
	
✓	Artists: A list of art-
ists’ names appears. 
Tap an artist, and 
all the albums and 
songs by that artist 
appear. Tap a song, 
and it plays. To 
see the list of art-
ists again, you can 
either tap the Artists 
button near the 
upper-left corner 
of the screen or tap 
the Artists tab at 
the bottom of the 
screen.
	
	Figure 7-5 shows 
the scrolling list of 
albums you’ll see 
after you tap an art-
ist’s name. (In this 
case, the artist is 
Todd Rundgren, one 
of Bob’s favorite 
artists.)
	
✓	Songs: The song 
plays.
Figure 7-5: Bob tapped Todd Rundgren in the list of artists, 
and this appeared.

Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
✓	Albums: The Albums option works pretty much the same way as Artists, 
except you see a list of album covers instead of a list of artists. Tap an 
album, and its contents appear.
	
	To play one of the songs on the album, tap it. To return to the list of 
albums, tap the Albums button near the upper-left corner of the screen 
or tap the Albums tab at the bottom.
	
✓	Genres: When you tap Genres, a list of genres — Comedy, Rock, Pop, 
Hip Hop/Rap, and so on — appears. Tap a genre, and you see a list of the 
songs in that genre.
	
✓	More: Tap More to see Compilations and Composers, which work the 
same as the Playlist, Songs, and other tabs.
	
If you’re looking for other iTunes content such as movies or TV shows, you 
find them in the Videos app, which we cover in Chapter 8. Podcasts are found 
in the Podcasts app, and iTunes U courses are found in the iTunes U app. The 
Videos app is preinstalled, and the Podcasts app is installed when you install 
iOS 8. You’ll need to download iTunes U from the App Store (it’s free) if you 
want to it on your iPad mini.
What’s the difference between 
artists and composers?
If you’re wondering about the difference 
between an artist and a composer, imagine this 
if you will: You have a recording in your iTunes 
library of a track entitled Symphony No. 5 in C 
Minor. The composer will always be Ludwig 
van Beethoven, but the artist could be the 
London Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, the Austin Klezmer Ensemble, or 
many other performers. Here’s another exam-
ple: The ballad “Yesterday” was composed by 
John Lennon and Paul McCartney but has been 
performed by artists who include The Beatles, 
Ray Charles, Boyz II Men, Dave Grusin, and 
Marianne Faithfull.
Now you may be wondering where your iPad 
gets this kind of info because you know you 
didn’t supply it. Check this out: Click a track 
in iTunes on your computer, choose File➪Get 
Info, and then click the Info tab at the top of the 
window.
That’s just some of the information that can 
be embedded in an audio track. This embed-
ded information, sometimes referred to as the 
track’s tags, is what your iPad uses to distin-
guish between artists and composers. If a track 
doesn’t have a composer tag, you won’t find it 
on the Composers tab on your iPad.

 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
Taking Control of Your Tunes
If you’ve read along so far, you have the basics down and can find and play 
songs. In this section, we take a look at some of the things you can do with 
your iPad mini when it’s in music mode.
Playing with the audio controls
First things first: We look at the controls you use after you tap a song. Peek 
back at Figure 7-1 to see the location of these controls:
	
✓	Volume: Drag the little dot to the left or right to reduce or increase, 
respectively, the volume level.
	
✓	Previous track/rewind: When a track is playing, tap once to go to the 
beginning of the track or tap twice to go to the start of the preceding 
track in the list. Press and hold down this icon to rewind the track at 
double speed.
	
✓	Play/pause: Tap to play or pause the track.
	
✓	Next track/fast forward: Tap to skip to the next track in the list. Press 
and hold down this icon to fast-forward at double speed.
	
	You can display playback con-
trols any time a track is playing. 
Better still, this trick works even 
when you’re using another app 
or your Home screen(s): Just 
swipe upward from the bottom 
of the iPad screen to bring up 
Control Center, which includes 
the musical controls shown in Figure 7-6.
	
	The playback controls may or may not override the audio from apps that 
have their own audio, such as many games, any app that records audio, 
and VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) apps such as Skype.
	
	You can even control music from Control Center when your iPad screen 
is locked.
	
✓	Scrubber bar and playhead: Drag the little red line (the playhead) along 
the scrubber bar to skip to any point within the track.
	
	You can adjust the scrub rate by sliding your finger downward on the 
screen as you drag the playhead along the scrubber bar. Check out the 
section in Chapter 20 on the hidden iTunes scrub speed tip for addi-
tional details. By the way, this slick trick works in many other apps that 
use a scrubber bar, most notably the Videos app.
Figure 7-6: These controls appear when you 
swipe upward.

138
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
✓	Repeat: Tap Repeat and an overlay offers three options:
	
•	Repeat the current song.
	
•	Repeat the current playlist, album, artist, genre, and so on.
	
•	Repeat off.
	
✓	Create: Tap Create and an overlay offers four options:
	
•	Create a new radio station (from scratch).
	
•	Create a new radio station from the current song.
	
•	Create a new radio station from the artist performing the 
current song.
	
•	Create a new Genius playlist based on the current song.
	
✓	Shuffle: Tap this button to play songs at random; tap again to play songs 
in the order in which they appear on-screen. When Shuffle is enabled, it 
turns kind of pinkish and says, “Shuffle All.”
But wait, there’s more. If you tap the Now Playing button (upper left), the 
album art fills the screen. Tap anywhere to see the controls and tabs at the 
top and bottom of the screen.
Note that when album art is on-
screen, the controls move from the 
top of the screen to the bottom, and 
back and track list icons now appear 
at the top, as shown in Figure 7-7.
Earlier in this section, we explain 
how to use the volume control, the 
previous track/rewind icon, the play/
pause icon, the next track/fast for-
ward icon, the scrubber bar, and the 
playhead. They may look slightly dif-
ferent on this screen, but they work 
in the same way.
The new icons at the top of the 
screen are as follows:
	
✓	Back: Tap this icon to return to 
the preceding screen.
	
✓	Track list: Tap this icon to see 
all the tracks on the album 
that’s currently playing, as 
shown in Figure 7-8; tap any 
song to play it.
Figure 7-7: You see these additional icons after 
you tap the Now Playing button.

139
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
If you tap the song title 
(“A Dream Goes on 
Forever” in Figure 7-7), 
five dots appear in its 
place. Swipe or tap the 
dots and they turn to 
stars; use the stars to rate 
the song from zero to five 
stars. In Figure 7-8, we’ve 
rated the song that’s 
playing four stars. Tap 
anywhere but on the stars 
and the song title returns 
in place of the dots or 
stars.
Why would you want 
to assign star ratings to 
songs? One reason is that 
you can use star ratings 
to filter songs in iTunes 
on your Mac or PC. 
Another is that you can 
use them when you create 
smart playlists in iTunes. 
And last but not least, 
they look cool.
Creating playlists
Playlists let you organize songs around a particular theme or mood: operatic 
arias, romantic ballads, British invasion — whatever. Younger folks some-
times call them mixes.
Although it may be easier to create playlists in iTunes on your computer, 
your iPad mini makes it relatively easy to create (and listen to) playlists:
	
✓	To create a playlist: Tap the Playlists tab at the bottom of the screen 
and then tap the New Playlist button at the top of the list of playlists on 
the left. You’re asked to name your playlist. Do so and then tap Save. A 
list of all the songs on your iPad will appear in alphabetical order. Tap 
the ones you want to include; they’ll appear dimmed after you add them, 
as shown in Figure 7-9.
	
	After you’ve tapped every song you want in the list, tap the Done button 
in the upper right.
Figure 7-8: We’ve given this tune a four-out-of-five-star 
rating.

140
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
	You can select tracks 
for your playlist from 
the Songs, Artists, 
Albums, or 
Composers tabs that 
appear at the bottom 
of the screen while 
you’re creating your 
playlist.
	
✓	To listen to a play­
list: Tap the Playlists 
tab and then tap the 
playlist’s name to see 
a list of the songs it 
contains. If the list 
is longer than one 
screen, flick upward 
to scroll down. Tap a 
song in the list, and 
the song plays. When 
that song is over or 
you tap the Next Song 
button, the next song 
in the playlist plays. 
This continues until 
the last song in the 
playlist has played, 
at which point your 
iPad shuts up.
	
	Songs won’t play in order if you’ve enabled the shuffle or repeat func-
tions (both discussed in “Playing with the audio controls,” earlier in this 
chapter).
	
	Although you can’t create smart playlists on your iPad, they totally rock. 
What is a smart playlist? Glad you asked. A smart playlist selects tracks 
based on criteria you specify, such as artist name, date added, rating, 
genre, or year. Fire up iTunes on your computer and choose File➪New 
Smart Playlist to get started.
And that’s all there is to selecting, creating, and playing songs in a playlist.
It doesn’t take a Genius
Genius selects songs from your music library that go great together. To use it, 
either tap the Genius tab at the bottom of the screen or tap the Create button 
and choose Genius Playlist. What happens next depends on which way you 
started.
Figure 7-9: This is how to create a playlist on your iPad mini.

141
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
If you tapped the Genius tab at the bottom of the screen, your iPad will 
display a collection of premade Genius mixes with names such as Hip Hop, 
Classic Rock, New Wave, or Punk, which are based on the songs in your 
library. Tap one and your iPad selects 25 songs of that type that it thinks will 
go well together.
If you tap the Create button on the main screen (refer to Figure 7-1) and 
choose Genius Playlist, your iPad selects 25 songs it thinks will go well with 
the current song. If no song is currently playing when you choose Genius 
Playlist, an alphabetical list of songs appears and you’ll need to select a song 
for the Genius playlist to be generated.
	
The less popular the song, artist, or genre, the more likely Genius will choke 
on it. When that happens, you see an alert that asks you to try again because 
this song doesn’t have enough related songs to create a Genius playlist.
A brief AirPlay interlude
You may or may not see another icon that’s 
useful for listening to music. This one appears in 
Control Center and is called AirPlay. The AirPlay 
icon and its overlay look like this at Bob’s house:
AirPlay is a wicked cool technology that lets you 
wirelessly stream music, photos, and video to 
AirPlay-enabled devices such as Apple’s AirPort 
Extreme, AirPort Express Wi-Fi base stations, 
and Apple TV, as well as third-party AirPlay-
enabled devices such as speakers and HDTVs.
The AirPlay icon and selector overlay appear only 
if your iPad detects an AirPlay-enabled device on 
the same Wi-Fi network. When Bob taps Great 
Room Apple TV, whatever is playing on the Music 
app is sent to the Apple TV in his den. The Apple 
TV is, in turn, connected to his home theater 
sound system and high-def TV via HDMI.
If you use an Apple TV as your AirPlay-enabled 
device, you can also stream music, video, and 
photos from your iPad to your HDTV.
Finally, iPads also offer a cool video-mirroring 
option when used with a second- or third-­
generation Apple TV. To use this awesome 
­feature, swipe up from the bottom of the screen 
to bring up Control Center, and then tap the 
AirPlay icon. When you select an Apple TV, a 
switch appears for the Mirroring option. Enable 
it and whatever appears on your iPad’s screen 
will appear also on your big-screen TV.
If you have an HDMI-equipped TV and/or a 
decent sound system and have decent Wi-Fi 
bandwidth, you’ll love Apple TV and AirPlay.

142
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
When you create a Genius playlist, you find it at the top of your playlists list. 
Tap the Genius playlist, and you see the 25 songs that Genius selected. In 
addition, three new buttons appear near the top of the screen:
	
✓	New: Select a different song to use as the basis for a Genius playlist.
	
✓	Refresh: See a list of 25 songs that “go great with” the song you’re lis-
tening to (or the song you selected). If you don’t like the selection, tap 
Refresh again and different tracks will appear. Keep tapping until you’re 
satisfied with Genius’s choices.
	
✓	Save: Save this Genius playlist so that you can listen to it whenever 
you like.
When you save a Genius playlist, it inherits the name of the song it’s based 
on and appears in your library with a Genius icon that looks like the Genius 
button. And the next time you sync your iPad, the Genius playlist magically 
appears in iTunes.
	
You can also create a Genius playlist in iTunes and then sync it with your 
iPad mini.
Customizing Volume and Equalizer Settings
You can tweak volume and equalizer settings to customize your iPad mini-as-
an-iPod experience. If you’ve been bothered when the volume of some songs 
was higher than others, check out the iTunes Sound Check feature. If you 
want to adjust certain frequencies, the equalizer enables you to do so. And 
if you want to set a maximum volume limit, tell your iPad mini to make it so. 
The following sections explain how.
Play all songs at the same volume level
The iTunes Sound Check option automatically adjusts the level of songs so 
that they play at the same volume relative to each other. That way, one song 
never blasts out your ears even if the recording level is much louder than 
that of the song before or after it. To tell the iPad mini to use these volume 
settings, you first have to turn on the feature in iTunes on your computer:
	
1.	Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (PC).
	
2.	Click the Playback tab.
	
3.	Select the Sound Check check box to enable it.

143
 Chapter 7: The Listening Experience
Now you need to tell the iPad mini to use the Sound Check settings from 
iTunes. Here’s how to do that on your iPad:
	
1.	On the iPad’s Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	In the list of settings, tap Music.
	
3.	Tap the Sound Check on-off switch so that it turns green.
Choose an equalizer setting
An equalizer increases or decreases the relative levels of specific frequencies 
to enhance the sound you hear. Some equalizer settings emphasize the bass 
(low-end) notes in a song; other equalizer settings make the higher frequen-
cies more apparent. The iPad has more than a dozen equalizer presets, with 
names such as Acoustic, Bass Booster, Bass Reducer, Dance, Electronic, Pop, 
and Rock. Each one is ostensibly tailored to a specific type of music.
The way to find out whether you prefer using equalization is to listen to 
music while trying different settings. First start listening to a song you like. 
Then, while the song is playing, follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the Home button on the front of your iPad mini.
	
2.	On the Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
3.	In the list of settings, tap Music.
	
4.	In the list of Music settings, tap EQ.
	
5.	Tap different EQ presets (Pop, Rock, R&B, or Dance, for example), 
and listen carefully to the way they change how the song sounds.
	
6.	When you find an equalizer preset that you think sounds good, press 
the Home button, and you’re finished.
If you don’t like any of the presets, tap Off at the top of the EQ list to turn off 
the equalizer.
	
At the risk of giving away one of the tips in Chapter 20, we feel obliged to men-
tion that you may get somewhat longer battery life if you keep EQ turned off.
Set a volume limit for music (and videos)
You can instruct your iPad mini to limit the loudest listening level for audio 
or video. To do so, here’s the drill:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	In the list of settings, tap Music.

144
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
3.	In the list of Music settings, tap Volume Limit.
	
4.	Drag the slider to adjust the maximum volume level to your liking.
	
The Volume Limit setting limits the volume of only music and videos; it 
doesn’t apply to podcasts or audiobooks. And, although the setting works 
with any headset, headphones, or speakers plugged into the headset jack on 
your iPad, it doesn’t affect the sound played on your iPad mini’s internal 
speaker.
By the way, speaking of that lone internal iPad mini speaker, it’s not in stereo, 
but it sounds pretty good just the same. Of course, when you plug in head-
phones, you hear rich stereo output.
Shopping with the iTunes Store App
Last but certainly not least, the iTunes Store app lets you use your iPad mini 
to download, buy, or rent just about any song, album, movie, or TV show. 
And if you’re fortunate enough to have an iTunes gift card or gift certificate in 
hand, you can redeem it directly from your iPad mini.
If you want to do any of that, however, you must first sign in to your iTunes 
Store account. Follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	In the list of settings, tap iTunes & App Store.
	
3.	Tap Sign In.
	
4.	Type your username and password.
Or, in the unlikely event that you don’t have an iTunes Store account already, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	In the list of settings, tap Store.
	
3.	Tap Create New Account.
	
4.	Follow the on-screen instructions.
After the iTunes Store knows who you are (and, more importantly, knows 
your credit card number), tap the iTunes Store icon on your Home screen 
(or the Store button in the Music app) and shop until you drop. The iTunes 
Store works almost the same as the iTunes App Store, which you read about 
in Chapter 11.

P
 
icture this scene: The smell of popcorn permeates the room as you and 
your family congregate to watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster. A 
motion picture soundtrack swells up. The images on the screen are stunning. 
And all eyes are fixed on the iPad mini.
Okay, here comes the reality check. The iPad mini is not going to replace a 
wall-sized high-definition television as the centerpiece of your home 
theater (though as you discover, you can watch material that 
originates on the mini on the bigger screen). Then again, 
it’s worth pointing out that the gorgeous Retina display 
on the iPad mini 2 and mini 3 has a higher-resolution 
screen than even the high-definition television in your 
living room — and is among the finest-looking dis-
plays we’ve ever seen on a handheld device. Even a 
small-screen iPad is going to grab your attention.
Bottom line: Watching movies and other videos on 
Apple’s prized tablet is a cinematic treat. What’s 
more, you have front and rear cameras that can help 
turn you, under certain circumstances, into a  
filmmaker — right from the device.
And video on the iPad mini ventures into another area: 
video chat. You can keep in touch with friends and loved ones 
by gazing into each other’s pupils. It’s all done through a version 
of FaceTime, a clever video chat program that comes with your iPad. In the 
interest of equal time, we’d also like to point out that you can do video chats 
on your iPad by downloading a popular third-party app such as Skype — and 
do clever group chats via another app called Spin from Net Power & Light.

146
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
We get to FaceTime later in this chapter. For now, and without any further 
ado, we get on with the show!
Finding Stuff to Watch
You have a few main ways to find and watch videos on your iPad mini. You 
can fetch all sorts of fare from the iTunes Store, whose virtual doors you can 
open directly from the iPad. Or you can sync content that already resides on 
your Mac or PC. (If you haven’t done so yet, now is as good a time as any to 
read Chapter 3 for all the details on syncing.)
The videos you can watch on the mini generally are in one of the following 
categories:
	
✓	Movies, TV shows, and music videos from the iTunes Store: You can 
watch these by tapping the Videos icon on the Home screen.
	
	The iTunes Store features dedicated sections for purchasing or renting 
episodes of TV shows, as shown in Figure 8-1, and for buying or renting 
movies, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-1: Buying and watching TV on the iPad is deadly fun.
	
	Pricing varies, but it’s not atypical (as of this writing) to fork over $1.99 
to pick up an episode of a popular TV show in standard definition or 
$2.99 for a high-def version. And a few shows are free. You can also pur-
chase a complete season of a favorite show. The final season of a classic 
show such as Lost costs $24.99 in standard-def and $29.99 in high-def.

147
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
Figure 8-2: You can spend hours watching movies on the iPad.
	
	A new release feature film typically costs $19.99 in high definition or 
$14.99 in standard def. But you can find HD movies for as little as $9.99 
and sometimes even less.
	
	You can also rent many movies, typically for $2.99, $3.99, or $4.99, though 
Apple usually serves up a juicy 99-cent rental as well. Not all movies can 
be rented, and we’re not wild about current rental restrictions — you 
have 30 days to begin watching a rented flick and a day to finish watching 
after you’ve started, though you can watch as often as you want during 
the 24-hour period. But that’s showbiz for you. Such films appear in their 
own Rented Movies section in the video list, which you get to by tapping 
Videos. The number of days before your rental expires is displayed.
	
	In some instances, World War Z being one example, purchasing a movie 
also affords you so-called iTunes Extras for your Mac or PC, featuring 
the kind of bonus content that is sometimes reserved for DVDs.
	
	Tap a movie listing in iTunes, and you can generally preview a trailer 
before buying (or renting) and check out additional tidbits: the plot sum-
mary, credits, reviews, and customer ratings, as well as other movies 
that appealed to other buyers of this one. See Figure 8-3. And you can 
search films by genre or top charts (the ones other people are buying 
or renting), or rely on the Apple Genius feature for recommendations 
based on stuff you’ve already watched. (Genius works for movies and 
TV much the way it works for music, as we explain in Chapter 7.) Apple 
also groups movies by various themes, Date Night Movies and Indie New 
Releases being two examples.
	
✓	The boatload of video podcasts and courseware, featured in the free 
Podcasts and iTunes U apps, both from Apple: Podcasts started out 
as another form of Internet radio, although instead of listening to live 

148
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
streams, you downloaded files 
onto your computer or iPod to 
take in at your leisure. Lots of 
audio podcasts are still avail-
able, but the focus here is 
on video. You can watch free 
episodes that cover Sesame 
Street videos, sports, invest-
ing, political shows, and much 
more. And you can take a semi-
nar at Harvard, Stanford, and 
other prestigious institutions, 
as shown in Figure 8-4. Indeed, 
iTunes U boasts more than 
800,000 free lectures and other 
educational resources from 
around the world, many of them 
videos. And iTunes U now has 
content for younger students 
too, from K-12. Better still: no 
homework, no grades, and no 
tuition.
	
✓	Videos that play via entertain-
ment apps: For example, Netflix offers an app that enables you to use 
your Netflix subscription, if you 
have one, to stream video on 
your iPad. Amazon’s appealing 
Amazon Instant Video streaming 
app for members of its Amazon 
Prime service is also available. 
Various TV networks offer their 
own apps so that you can catch 
up on favorite shows on your 
iPad. The Hulu Plus subscrip-
tion app also lets you tap into 
current and past shows. And if 
you’re an HBO subscriber, go 
for the HBO Go app.
	
✓	The movies you’ve created 
in iMovie software or other 
software on the Mac or, for 
that matter, other programs on 
the PC: Plus you can view all 
the other videos you may have 
downloaded from the Internet, 
though sometimes you must 
convert these to a format that 
the iPad mini recognizes.
Figure 8-4: Get smart. iTunes U offers a slew of 
lectures on diverse topics.
Figure 8-3: Bone up on a movie before buying 
or renting it.

149
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
	
✓	Videos you’ve given birth to using the rear- or front-facing camera: 
A version of iMovie is made for iPads (and iPhones). The optional app 
costs $4.99 but is free for anyone running an iOS 7 or iOS 8 device, and 
a free upgrade is available if you have an earlier version. Check out the 
“Shooting Your Own Videos” section, later in this chapter, for direction 
on creating movies with the iPad mini.
You may have to prepare some videos so that they’ll play on your iPad. To do 
so, highlight the video in question after it resides in your iTunes library. In 
iTunes, choose File➪Create New Version➪Create iPad or Apple TV Version. 
Alas, creating an iPad version of a video doesn’t work for all the video con-
tent you download from the Internet, including video files in the AVI, DivX, 
MKV, Flash, WMV, and Xvid formats.
	
For a somewhat technical work-around without potential conversion hassles, 
try the $2.99 Air Video HD app from InMethod s.r.o. The utility app can 
deliver AVI, DivX, MKV, and other videos that wouldn’t ordinarily play on 
your iPad. You have to download the free Air Video Server software to your 
Mac or PC to stream content to your iPad, even across the Internet. Or, for 
converting from a broader range of formats, try the excellent (and free) 
HandBrake app from http://handbrake.fr/.
Are we compatible?
The iPad works with a whole bunch of video, 
although not everything you’ll want to watch 
will make it through. Several Internet video 
standards — notably Adobe Flash — are not 
supported. The absence of Flash is a bugaboo 
because Flash has been the technology behind 
much of the video on the web, though that land-
scape is changing. Even Adobe is pulling sup-
port for mobile versions of Flash.
Fortunately, Apple backs other increasingly 
popular standards  —  HTML5, CSS 3, and 
JavaScript. But the company was apparently 
sensitive enough to the issue that in the early 
days of the iPad, Apple made mention of several 
sites where video would play on the iPad. The 
list included CNN, The New York Times, Vimeo, 
Time, ESPN, Major League Baseball, NPR, The 
White House, Sports Illustrated, TED, Nike, 
CBS, Spin, and National Geographic. By now, of 
course, most popular videos are readily acces-
sible, but know that from time to time you may 
still run into a snag.
With the appropriate utility software, you might 
also be able to convert some nonworking video 
to an iPad-friendly format on your computer. 
But if something doesn’t play now, it may in 
the future because Apple has the capability to 
upgrade the iPad mini through software.

For more on compatibility, check out the nearby “Are we compatible?” side-
bar (but read it at your own risk).
Playing Video
Now that you know what you want to watch, here’s how to watch it:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Videos icon.
	
	 You see a tabbed interface for Movies, TV Shows, and Music Videos. If 
Home Sharing is running on your computer through iTunes, a Shared tab 
will also be visible.
	
2.	Tap the Movies tab.
	
	 For these steps, we walk you through watching a movie, but the steps 
for TV shows and music videos are similar.
	
	 As Figure 8-5 shows, you see poster thumbnails for any movies you pre-
viously purchased through iTunes — even for those movies you haven’t 
downloaded yet. (Some posters may reveal only a dimmed box, showing 
the title of the movie and a filmstrip icon.)
	
	 If you see the iCloud symbol on the video thumbnail, you can stream the 
movie, provided you have a decent Internet connection.
	
	 Tap Settings➪Videos to choose whether to see thumbnails for all the 
videos you have stored in iCloud or on the device, or show only those 
that have been downloaded to your iPad.

3.	Tap the poster that represents 
the movie or other video you 
want to watch.
	
	 You’re taken to a movie sum-
mary page that reveals a larger 
movie poster, a play icon, and 
tabs for Details, Chapters, and 
Related, as shown in Figure 8-6.
	
•	Tap Details (if you’re not 
already in that view) to 
see the plot summary, 
the run time, and sundry 
other details about the 
movie in question.
	
•	Tap Chapters to jump 
to particular scenes or 
chapters in the movie and 
watch from that scene 
on. (If you’re watching 
a TV show, you see the 
Episodes tab here instead.)
	
•	Tap Related to see posters 
representing movies that are similar to this one and are (not so 
coincidentally) available to rent or buy in iTunes.
	
4.	To start playing a movie (or 
resume playing from where 
you left off), tap the play icon.
	
	 Alternatively, from the Chapters 
view (see Figure 8-7), tap any 
chapter to start playing from 
that point.
	
	 Want to start playing from 
where you left off rather than 
from the beginning (or vice 
versa)? Visit the Settings app, 
tap Videos, and make your 
selection.
	
5.	(Optional) Rotate your iPad 
mini to landscape mode to 
maximize a video’s display on 
a movie you shot.
	
	 Hollywood movies and other 
content from iTunes can be

Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
watched only in landscape mode. Video you’ve shot can be viewed in 
portrait or landscape mode.
	
The original iPad mini doesn’t give you a full high-definition presentation 
because that requires at least 1280-by-720-pixel resolution. Instead, the 
images are scaled down slightly. Having said that, we don’t think you’ll even 
notice the reduced quality of the images — unless, that is, you place them 
beside an iPad mini 2 or 3 with a Retina display.
Finding and Working the Video Controls
While a video is playing, tap the screen to display the controls shown in 
Figure 8-8. Here’s how to work the controls:
	
✓	To play or pause the video: Tap the play/pause icon.
	
✓	To adjust the volume: Drag the volume slider to the right to raise the 
volume and to the left to lower it. The volume adjusts relative to how 
the physical Volume buttons are controlling audio levels.
	
✓	To restart or go back: Tap the restart/rewind icon to restart the video, 
or tap and hold down the same icon to rewind.
	
✓	To skip forward: Tap and hold down the fast forward icon to advance the 
video. Or skip ahead by dragging the playhead along the scrubber bar.
	
✓	To set how the video fills the screen: Tap the scale icon, which toggles 
between filling the entire screen with video or fitting the video to the 
screen. Alternatively, you can double-tap the video to go back and forth 
between fitting and filling the screen.
	
	Fitting the video to the screen displays the film in its theatrical aspect 
ratio. You may see black bars above and below the video (or to its 
sides), which some people don’t like. The bars on the top and bottom 
are an example of letterboxing; on the sides, it’s pillarboxing. Filling the 
entire screen with the video may crop or trim the sides or top of the pic-
ture, so you don’t see the complete scene that the director shot.
	
✓	To select subtitle settings: Tap the audio and subtitles icon. You see 
options to select a different language, turn on or hide subtitles, and turn 
on or hide closed captioning. The control appears only if the movie sup-
ports any of these features. You can change certain subtitle styles by vis-
iting Settings➪General➪Accessibility➪Subtitles & Captioning and then 
turning on the Closed Captions + SDH switch.
	
✓	To make the controls go away: Tap the screen again (or just wait for 
them to go away on their own).

153
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
	
✓	To access bonus features in some commercial movies: Tap the Special 
Features button, which is shown at the bottom of Figure 8-8. You won’t 
see this button in every movie.
	
✓	To tell your iPad you’ve finished watching a video: Tap Done. You 
return to the last videos screen that was visible before you started 
watching the movie.
Figure 8-8: Controlling video.
Watching Video on a Big TV
We love watching movies on the iPad, but we also recognize the limitations 
of a smaller screen, even one as stunning as the Retina display. Friends won’t 
crowd around to watch with you, as good as it is, so Apple offers two ways to 
display video from your iPad to a TV:
	
✓	AirPlay: Through the AirPlay feature, you can wirelessly stream movies — 
commercial flicks or videos you shot — as well as photos and music 
from the iPad to an Apple TV box connected to an HDTV. Start watching 
the movie on the iPad and tap the AirPlay button by swiping up from the 
bottom of the screen and summoning Control Center. You can watch only 
one screen at a time. Tap Apple TV to stream to the TV through the Apple 
TV box. Tap iPad to watch on the iPad.

154
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
	You can multitask while streaming a video. Therefore, while the kids are 
watching a flick on the TV, you can surf the web or catch up on email.
	
	Although you can stream from an iPad to an Apple TV and switch 
screens between the two, you can’t stream a rented movie that you 
started watching on Apple TV to the iPad.
	
✓	AV adapter cables: Apple sells Lightning–to–digital AV and Lightning–to–
VGA adapters at $49 each for use with all iPad mini models.
	
	The digital AV (HDMI) adapter also lets you mirror the iPad mini screen 
on the connected TV or projector. So you can not only watch a movie or 
video but also view anything else that’s on the iPad’s screen: your Home 
screens, web pages, games, other apps, you name it.
	
	The digital AV adapter doesn’t include an HDMI cable, so you have to 
supply one. For more on accessories, check out Chapter 17.
Restricting Video Usage
If you’ve given an iPad mini to your kid or someone who works for you, you 
may not want that person spending time watching movies or television. You 
might want him or her to do something more productive, such as homework 
or the quarterly budget. That’s where parental restrictions come in. Please 
note that the use of this iron-fist tool can make you unpopular.
Tap Settings➪General➪Restrictions➪Enable Restrictions. You’re asked to 
establish or enter a previously established passcode. Twice. Having done 
so, you can set restrictions based on movie ratings (PG, R, and so on) and 
regulate access to TV shows, also based on ratings. You can also restrict 
FaceTime usage or use of the camera (which when turned off also turns off 
FaceTime). For more on restrictions, flip to Chapter 15, where we explain the 
settings for controlling (and loosening) access to iPad features.
Deleting Video from Your iPad mini
Video takes up space — lots of space. After the closing credits roll and you 
no longer want to keep a video on your iPad, here’s what you need to know 
about deleting it:
	
✓	To remove a downloaded video from the device — the flick remains in 
iCloud — tap Edit from the main Movies or TV Shows list screen, and tap 
the x-in-a-circle that appears on top of the movie poster. To confirm your 
intention, Apple asks whether you’re sure you want to delete the video. 
If you’re sure, tap Delete. (If you change your mind, tap Cancel.)

155
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
	
✓	If you delete a rented movie before watching it on your iPad mini, it’s 
gone. You have to spend (more) loot if you hope to watch it in the future 
on the iPad.
Shooting Your Own Videos
The rear iSight camera on your iPad mini can record video up to the high-
definition techie standard of 1080p and at 30 frames per second (fps), or as 
full-motion video. Come again? That’s a fancy way to say that the video ought 
to play back smoothly. The front FaceTime camera can also perform at 30 fps, 
but the 720p HD quality isn’t quite as good.
Another bonus is that the rear camera has built-in video stabilization, which 
helps compensate for slightly jittery videographers. You can shoot video with 
the front-facing FaceTime camera as well, which includes a sensor that per-
mits HDR, or high dynamic range, video. (Read Chapter 9 for more on HDR.) 
The video camera on the mini 2 and mini 3 models also permits you to zoom 
up to 3x — a feature that the original mini lacks.
Now that we’ve dispensed with that little piece of business, here’s how to 
shoot video on the iPad:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Camera icon.
	
2.	Drag along the right edge of the screen until Video mode is selected.
	
	 A dot appears next to the word Video, which is highlighted in yellow. You 
can also choose Time Lapse. (For details on the other options — Photo, 
Square, and Pano — read Chapter 9.)
	
	 You can’t switch from the front to the rear camera (or vice versa) while 
you’re capturing a scene. So before shooting anything, think about 
which camera you want to use, and then tap the front/rear camera icon 
in the top-right corner of the screen when you’ve made your choice.
	
3.	Tap the red record button (labeled in Figure 8-9) to begin shooting a 
scene.
	
	 When you choose a non-video shooting format — Photo or Square — the 
round shutter button is white. In any case, while you’re shooting a 
scene, the counter will tick off the seconds.
	
4.	Tap the red record button again to stop recording.
	
	 Your video is automatically saved to the Camera Roll album (labeled in 
Figure 8-9), alongside any other saved videos and digital stills that land 
in the Photos app.

156
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Figure 8-9: Lights, camera, action.
Going fast
The Time-Lapse camera feature added in iOS 8 enables you to capture a 
scene and play it back at a warped speed. Choose Time-Lapse the same 
way that you select other shooting modes, and then tap the record icon. 
The app captures photos at dynamically selected intervals. When you’re 
ready to watch the sped-up sequence, tap play as you do with any other 
video.
Editing what you shot
We assume that you captured some really great footage, but you prob-
ably shot some stuff that belongs on the cutting room floor as well. No big 
whoop — you can perform simple edits right on your iPad mini. Tap the 
Camera Roll album in the lower-right corner of the Camera app to find your 
recordings. Then:
	
1.	Tap a video recording to display the on-screen controls.
	
2.	Drag the start and end points along the frame viewer at the top of the 
screen to select only the video you want to keep.
	
	 Hold your finger over the section to expand the frame viewer to make 
it easier to apply your edits. Tap the play icon to preview your 
surgery.

157
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
	
3.	Choose what to 
do with your 
trimmed clip by 
tapping Trim and 
then (as shown in 
Figure 8-10):
	
•	Tap Trim 
Original to 
permanently 
remove 
scenes from 
the original 
clip.
	
•	Tap Save 
as New Clip 
to create 
a newly 
trimmed video clip; the original video remains intact, and the new 
clip is stored in the Camera Roll album.
	
•	Tap Cancel to start over.
This method will let you edit footage captured only on an iOS device, not video 
from a digital camcorder or camera — even if you sync it to the iPad mini.
	
For more ambitious editing on the mini, consider iMovie for iPad, a $4.99 app 
(free to purchasers of new iOS 7 and iOS 8 devices) resembling a bare-bones 
version of iMovie for Mac computers. Through iMovie, you can export your 
finished video to YouTube, Vimeo, CNN iReport, Facebook, and iMovie 
Theater. And iMovie for iPad lets you produce Hollywood-style movie trailers, 
just like on a Mac.
	
Any video edited with the iOS version of iMovie must have originated on an 
iOS device. You can’t mix in footage shot with a digital camera or obtained 
elsewhere.
Sharing video
You can play back what you’ve just shot in portrait or landscape mode. And 
if the video is any good, you’ll likely want to share it with a wider audience. 
To do so, open the Camera Roll album and tap the thumbnail for the video 
in question. Tap the share icon, and you can email the video (if the video file 
isn’t too large) or send it as a Message (see Chapter 5).
Figure 8-10: Getting a trim.

158
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
And you have many other options: You can save the video to iCloud or share 
it in numerous other places, including Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, 
Vimeo, and (if a Chinese keyboard was enabled) the Chinese services 
Youku and Tudou. You can also view your video as part of a slideshow (see 
Chapter 9) or, if you have an Apple TV box, dispatch it to a big-screen televi-
sion via AirPlay.
Seeing Is Believing with FaceTime
We bet you can come up with a lengthy list of people you’d love to be able to 
eyeball in real time from afar. Maybe the list includes your old college room-
mate, or old college sweetheart, or your grandparents, who’ve long since 
retired to a warm climate.
That’s the beauty of FaceTime, the video chat app. FaceTime exploits the two 
cameras built into the devices, each serving a different purpose. The front 
camera lets you talk face to face. The back camera shows what you’re seeing 
to the person you’re talking to.
To take advantage of FaceTime, here’s what you need:
	
✓	Access to Wi-Fi or cellular: The people you’re talking to need Internet 
access, too. On an iOS device, you need Wi-Fi or a cellular connection. 
If you want to go with the cell connection, you need a mini or at least a 
third-generation iPad running iOS 6. On a Mac, you need an upstream 
or downstream Internet connection of at least 128 Kbps. You also need 
at least a 1Mbps upstream and downstream connection for HD-quality 
video calls.
	
	Using FaceTime over a cellular connection can quickly run through your 
monthly data allotment and prove hazardous to your budget. However, 
you can do an audio-only FaceTime call, which can cut down signifi-
cantly on your data usage.
	
✓	FaceTime on recipient’s device: Of course you can do FaceTime video 
only with someone capable of receiving a FaceTime video call. That person 
must have an iPad mini, an iPad 2 or later, an Intel-based Mac computer 
(OS X 10.6.6 or later), a recent-model iPod touch, or an iPhone 4 or later. 
(FaceTime first appeared on Apple’s prized smartphone.)
Getting started with FaceTime
When you use FaceTime for the first time, after you tap the app’s icon from 
the Home screen, you’re required to sign in to FaceTime using your Apple 
ID, which can be your iTunes Store account, iCloud ID, or another Apple 
account. (You may have previously supplied this info when setting up your 
iPad mini.) If you don’t have an account, tap Create New Apple ID to set one 

159
 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
up in FaceTime. You also must supply an email address or a phone number 
that callers use to call you from their own FaceTime-capable iPad, Mac, 
iPhone, or iPod touch.
	
If this is the first time you’ve used a particular email address for FaceTime, 
Apple sends an email to that address to verify the account. Tap (or click) Verify 
Now and enter your Apple ID and password to complete the FaceTime setup. If 
the email address resides in Mail on the iPad, you’re already good to go.
If you have multiple email addresses, callers can use any of them 
for FaceTime. To add an email address after the initial setup, tap 
Settings➪FaceTime➪Add Another Email. And phone numbers (for your 
iPhone) work too.
	
In fact, it’s often a good idea to allocate separate email addresses for 
FaceTime, assuming you have more than one Apple product that can take 
advantage of it. That way, a call to you when you’re on your Mac, for example, 
won’t ring on the iPad mini instead.
You can turn FaceTime on or off in Settings. However, if you don’t turn off 
FaceTime, you don’t have to sign back in when you launch the app.
Making a FaceTime call
Now the real fun begins — making a video call. (We say specifically “video 
call” because you can now also make FaceTime audio calls.) Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Start the FaceTime app from the Home screen or by asking Siri to 
open the app on your behalf.
	
	 You can check out what you look like in a window prior to making a 
FaceTime call. So powder your nose and put on a happy face.
	
2.	Tap the Video tab.
	
	 Alternatively, tap the Audio tab to make an audio-only FaceTime call.
	
3.	Choose someone to call:
	
•	Your contacts: Tap the + icon to choose the name, and then tap the 
email address or phone number that the contact has associated 
with FaceTime.
	
•	Someone new: Tap the field in which to enter a name, email 
address, or number, and then tap the appropriate number in the 
list that appears. If this is the first time you’re entering a number, 
you’ll have the option to create a contact or add the number to an 
existing contact.

160
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
4.	If necessary, move the picture-in-picture window.
	
	 When a call is underway, you can see what you look like to the other person 
through a small picture-in-picture window, which you can drag to any 
corner of the video call window. The small window lets you know if your 
mug has dropped out of sight.
	
5.	(Optional) To toggle between 
the front and rear cameras, 
tap the camera icon (labeled in 
Figure 8-11).
	
6.	Tap the End Call button when 
you’re ready to hang up.
While you’re on a FaceTime call, the 
following tips will be handy:
	
✓	Rotate the iPad mini to its side 
to change the orientation. In 
landscape mode, you’re more 
likely to see everybody at once.
	
✓	Silence or mute a call by tap-
ping the microphone icon. Be 
aware that you can still be seen 
even though you’re not heard 
(and you can still see and hear 
the other person).
	
✓	Momentarily check out another 
iPad app by pressing the Home 
button and then tapping the 
icon for the app. At this juncture, 
you can still talk over FaceTime, 
but you can no longer see the 
person. Tap the green bar at the 
top of the mini screen to bring 
the person and the FaceTime app 
back in front of you.
	
Caller ID on FaceTime works just like caller ID on a regular phone call. You 
can choose the email address or phone number you want to display to some-
one when you call that person via FaceTime. Just tap the designated number 
under Caller ID in FaceTime settings.
	
You can initiate a FaceTime call also by double-pressing the Home button to 
summon the multitasking screen. At the top of the display, you’ll see circular 
mugs of the people you’ve recently been communicating with, including via 
FaceTime. Tap a mug and then tap the FaceTime video (or audio) icon to 
begin a new FaceTime session.

Bob (and Zeke the dog) in FaceTime.

 Chapter 8: iPad mini Videography
Receiving a FaceTime call
Of course, you can get FaceTime calls as well as make them. FaceTime doesn’t 
have to be open for you to receive a video call. Here’s how incoming calls work:
	
✓	Hearing the call: When a call 
comes in, the caller’s name (or 
email address) is prominently 
displayed on the iPad’s screen, 
as shown in Figure 8-12, and the 
mini rings.
	
✓	Accepting or declining the call: 
Tap Accept to answer the call 
or Decline if you’d rather not. 
If your mini is locked when a 
FaceTime call comes in, answer 
by sliding the green Slide to 
Answer button to the right, or 
decline by doing nothing and 
waiting for the caller to give up. 
You can also tap Message to 
send a canned iMessage (Sorry, 
I can’t talk right now; I’m on my 
way; Can I call you later?) or a 
custom message. You can also 
tap Remind Me to be reminded 
in one hour that you may want 
to call the person back.
	
✓	Silencing the ring: You can press the sleep/wake button at the top of 
the mini to silence the incoming ring. If you know you don’t want to 
be disturbed by FaceTime calls before you even hear the ring, flip the 
side switch on the iPad to mute. You may have to head to Settings (see 
Chapter 15) to change the function of this switch from lock rotation 
to mute. In Settings (or Control Center), you can also turn on Do Not 
Disturb to silence incoming FaceTime calls.
	
✓	Blocking unwanted callers: If a person who keeps trying to FaceTime 
you (yep, we’re treating it as a verb) becomes bothersome, you can 
block him or her. Go to Settings➪FaceTime➪Blocked, and choose the 
person’s name from your contacts. In the FaceTime app, you can block a 
caller who shows up on your caller list by tapping the i-in-a-circle next to 
the caller’s name and then tapping Block This Caller.
	
✓	Removing people from the call list: If you don’t want to block a caller but 
don’t want the person clogging up your call list, tap Edit, tap the circle next 
to the person’s name so that a check mark appears, and then tap Delete.
With that, we hereby silence this chapter. But you can do more with the cam-
eras on your iPad mini, and we get to that in Chapter 9.

hroughout this book, we sing the praises of the iPad mini’s vibrant mul-
titouch display. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more appealing smallish 
screen for watching movies or playing games. As you might imagine, 
the iPad you have recently purchased (or are lusting after) 
is also a spectacular photo viewer. Images are crisp and 
vivid, at least those that you shot properly. (C’mon, we 
know Ansel Adams is a distant cousin.)
What’s more, you can shoot some of those pictures 
directly with your prized tablet. The reasons, of 
course, are the front (FaceTime) and rear (iSight) 
cameras built into the device. If you read Chapter 8, 
you already know you can put those cameras to 
work capturing video. In this chapter, you get the 
big picture on shooting still images.
Okay, we need to get a couple of things out of the way: 
The iPad may never be the most comfortable substitute 
for a point-and-shoot digital camera, much less a pricey dig-
ital SLR. As critics, we can quibble about the fact that no flash 
is included. And shooting can be awkward.

164
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
But we’re here, friends, to focus on the positive. And having cameras on your 
iPad mini may prove to be a godsend when no better option is available. 
In Chapter 8, we tell you about the capability to capture full high-definition 
video up to what techies refer to as the 1080p standard.
In this chapter, we point out other optical enhancements in the most recent 
iPad minis. All iPad minis have a 5-megapixel iSight camera with backside 
illumination, an ƒ/2.4 aperture, and a five-element lens. Among other features, 
they have a hybrid infrared filter like what you’d find on an SLR, which helps 
lead to more uniform colors. And face detection makes sure the balance and 
focus are just right for up to ten faces on the screen.
All these features are photographer-speak for potentially snapping darn 
sweet pictures.
And we can think of certain circumstances — selling real estate, say, or shop-
ping for a new home — where tablet cameras are quite convenient.
Apple has also made finding the pictures in your stash an easier task, too, 
with an organizational structure in iOS 7 and iOS 8 that arranges photos in 
the Photos app by collections, moments, and years.
Meanwhile, you’re in for a real treat if you’re new to Photo Booth, a yuk-it-up 
Mac program that is also on the iPad mini. That may be the best, or at least 
the most fun, use of the cameras yet.
We get to Photo Booth at the end of this chapter. But over the next few pages, 
you discover the best ways to make the digital photos on the mini come 
alive, no matter how they managed to arrive on your machine.
Shooting Pictures
You can start shooting pictures on the iPad mini in a few ways. So we’re going 
to cut to the chase immediately:
	
1.	Fire up the camera itself. Choose one of the following:
	
•	On the Home screen, tap the Camera app icon.
	
•	From the lock screen, drag the Camera icon from the bottom-right 
corner in an upward motion.

165
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
•	Drag Control Center up from the bottom of the screen and tap the 
Camera app icon.
	
•	Ask Siri (read Chapter 14) to open the Camera app for you.
	
	 However you get here, your iPad has turned into the tablet equivalent of 
a Kodak Instamatic, minus the film, of course, and in a form factor that is 
obviously much bigger. The near-8-inch screen on the iPad mini provides 
a pretty sweet viewfinder.
	
	 If you’re using a version of iOS prior to iOS 7 with your iPad, make sure 
the switch at the bottom-right corner of the screen is set to camera 
mode rather than video mode.
	
2.	Keep your eyes peeled on the iPad mini display, and use the view-
finder to frame your image.
	
3.	Select a shooting format:
	
•	Photo: Think snapshot.
	
•	Square: This gives you a picture formatted to make nice with the 
popular Instagram photo-sharing app.
	
•	Pano (mini 2 or mini 3 models only): Short for panorama, this 
shooting mode lets you capture epic vistas.
	
•	Video or Time Lapse: We kindly refer you to Chapter 8.
	
	 You move from one format to another by swiping up or down along the 
right edge of the screen so that the format you’ve chosen is highlighted 
in yellow, with a yellow dot next to it.
	
4.	Snap your image:
	
•	Tap the white round camera button. The button is at the middle-
right edge of the screen whether you are holding the iPad mini in 
portrait mode or landscape mode (see Figure 9-1). As we show 
you in a moment, you’ll be able to change the point of focus if 
necessary.
	
•	Press the physical volume up or volume down button. These buttons 
are on the side of the tablet (portrait mode) or at the top of the 
device (landscape mode). Just be careful not to cover the lens with 
your fingers.
	
	 The image you shoot lands in the Camera Roll album, in the lower-right 
corner of the screen. We explain what you can do with the images on the 
iPad later in this chapter.

166
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Here are some tips for working with the Camera app:
	
✓	Adjust the focal point. Tap the portion of the screen in which you see 
the face or object you want as the image’s focal point. A small rectangle 
(not shown in Figure 9-1) surrounds your selection, and the iPad mini 
automatically adjusts the exposure and focus of that part of the image. 
The camera in the iPad can detect up to ten faces in a picture. Behind 
the scenes, the camera is balancing the exposure across each face. If you 
want to lock the focus and exposure settings while taking a picture, press 
and hold your finger against the screen until the rectangle pulses. AE/AF 
Lock will appear. Tap the screen again to make AE/AF Lock disappear.
	
	Next to the focus box is a sun icon. When that sunny exposure icon 
is visible, drag your finger up or down against the screen to increase 
or decrease the brightness in a scene. And you can lighten or darken 
scenes for both still photos and video.
	
✓	Zoom in or out. Tap the screen with two fingers and spread (unpinch) to 
zoom in or pinch to zoom out.
	
	The iPad has a 5X digital zoom, which basically crops and resizes an 
image. Such zooms are nowhere near as effective quality-wise as optical 
zooms on many digital cameras. Be aware that zooming works only with 
the rear camera still in camera mode; it doesn’t work with the front camera 
or when you shoot video.

✓	See grid lines to help you compose your picture. Tap Settings➪Photos &  
Camera➪Camera and tap the Grid switch to turn it on (the switch turns 
green). Grid lines can help you frame a shot using the photographic prin-
ciple known as the rule of thirds.
	
✓	Toggle between the front and rear cameras. Tap the front/rear camera 
icon (refer to Figure 9-1) in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
	The front camera is of lower quality than its rear cousin. But the front 
camera is more than adequate for the kinds of demands you put on it, 
including FaceTime and Photo Booth. You can say the same for older 
iPads.
	
✓	Shoot in HDR. To exploit HDR (high dynamic range) photography, tap 
the HDR icon. The HDR feature takes three separate exposures (long, 
normal, short) and blends the best parts of the three shots into a single 
image. In Settings (under Photos & Camera), you can choose to keep the 
normal photo along with your HDR result or just hang on to the latter.
	
✓	Burst out. In the blink of an eye, burst mode on the iPad can capture a 
burst of pictures — up to ten continuous images per second. Just keep 
your finger pressed against the camera button to keep on capturing 
those images. This feature works with the front FaceTime camera and 
the rear iSight camera.
	
✓	Capture panoramas. If you’re traveling to San Francisco, you’ll want a 
picture of the magnificent span that is the Golden Gate Bridge. In the 
Himalayas, you’d want a memento of Mount Everest. At a family reunion, 
you want that epic image of your entire extended clan. For just such 
moments, we recommend the panorama feature, which lets you shoot 
up to 240 degrees and stitch together a high-resolution image of up to 
43 megapixels. This feature is not available on the original iPad mini.
	
	To get going, drag the screen so that Pano becomes your shooting mode 
of choice. The word Pano will be in yellow, just to the right of the yellow 
dot and below the camera button. Position the phone so it’s at the start-
ing point and tap the camera button when you’re ready. Slowly and 
steadily pan in the direction of the arrow. (Tap the arrow if you prefer 
panning in the opposite direction.) Try to keep the arrow just above the 
yellow horizontal line. When the task is complete, you can admire your 
handiwork.
	
✓	Geotag your photos. The mini is pretty smart when it comes to geog-
raphy. Turn on Location Services (in Settings under Privacy) and the 
specific location settings for the camera appear in Settings. Pictures you 
take with the mini’s cameras are geotagged, or identified by where they 
were shot.
	
	Think long and hard before permitting images to be geotagged if you 
plan on sharing those images with people from whom you want to keep 
your address and other locations private — especially if you plan on 
sharing the photos online.

168
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
✓	Use the self-timer: Many physical cameras have a self-timer that lets you 
be part of a picture, perhaps in a group setting with friends. The new self-
timer built into the Camera app in iOS 8 adds this functionality to your 
iPad, whether you’re using the front or rear camera. If anything, the addi-
tion of the self-timing feature might improve the quality of your selfies.
	
	Tap the timer icon (labeled in Figure 9-1) and choose 3 seconds or 
10 seconds as the time interval between when you press the camera 
button and when the picture is captured. You’ll see a countdown on 
the screen leading up to that moment, and then the iPad will capture 
a burst of ten images. (You can keep all ten photos, none, or a number 
in between.) To turn off the self-timer, tap the Off button. Couldn’t be 
easier than that.
Of course, you’re not always going to use your iPad mini to take pictures. 
Fortunately, you can add pictures to your prized tablet in several other ways. 
Alas, one of these methods involves buying an accessory. We zoom in in the 
following sections.
Syncing pix
We devote an entire chapter (see Chapter 3) to synchronizing data with the 
iPad mini, so we don’t dwell on it here. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t men-
tion it in this chapter. (The assumption in this section is that you already 
know how to get pictures onto your computer.)
When the iPad is connected to your computer, click the Photos tab on the 
iPad Device page in iTunes on the Mac or PC. Then select a source from the 
Sync Photos From pop-up menu.
	
On a Mac, you can sync photos (and videos) via iPhoto software version 6.06 or 
later and Aperture 3.02 or later. On a PC, you can sync with Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 8.0 or later. Alternatively, with both computers, you can sync with any 
folder that contains pictures.
Connecting a digital camera or memory card
Almost all the digital cameras we’re aware of come with a USB cable that 
you can use to transfer images to a computer. Of course, the iPad mini isn’t 
a regular computer, and it isn’t equipped with a USB port, nor does it have a 
memory card slot.
Instead, Apple sells separate ($29 each) Lightning–to–USB camera adapter 
and Lightning–to–SD card camera reader cables for more recent iPad models, 
including the minis. These solutions work as follows:

169
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
1.	Connect your camera to your iPad, using one of the two aforemen-
tioned connectors.
	
	 If you’re going the USB route, kindly use the cable that comes with your 
camera because no such cable comes with Apple’s kit.
	
2.	Make sure that the iPad is unlocked.
	
3.	If you haven’t already done so, turn on the camera and ensure that it’s 
set to transfer pictures.
	
	 Consult the manual that came with the camera if you’re unsure which 
setting to use.
	
	 The Photos app on the iPad opens and displays the pictures that you 
can import from the camera.
	
4.	Tap Import All to select the entire bunch, or tap the individual pic-
tures you want to include if you’d rather cherry-pick.
	
	 A check mark appears next to each image you select. And that’s pretty 
much it: The iPad organizes the pictures into albums and such, as we 
describe later in this chapter.
At this point, you’re free to erase the pictures from your camera.
The SD card reader connector accommodates the SD memory cards 
common to so many digital camera models. The procedure works almost 
identically to the USB connector, except that you’re inserting the SD gizmo 
into the Lightning connector port rather than the USB connector men-
tioned previously. Just be careful to insert the SD gently to prevent any 
damage.
	
The Lightning connectors support many common photo formats, including 
JPEG and Raw. The latter is a format favored by photo enthusiasts.
	
The USB connector can be used with certain USB computer keyboards, MIDI 
keyboards, microphones, and even some USB memory card readers. Our 
advice: it never hurts to try.
Saving images from emails and the web
You can save many of the pictures that arrive in emails or pictures that 
you come across on the web easily: Just press and hold down your finger 
against the image, and then tap Save Image when the menu pops up a 
second later. Pictures are stored in the Camera Roll album we get to 
shortly. You can also tap Copy to paste said image into another app on 
your device.

170
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Tracking Down Your Pictures
So where exactly do your pictures live on the iPad mini? We just gave some 
of the answer away; the images you snap on the device first land in a photo 
album appropriately dubbed Camera Roll.
In the Photos or Camera app — you can get to the former by tapping a 
thumbnail image in the latter — you’ll also find pictures you’ve shared with 
friends and they’ve shared with you through the iCloud photo-sharing fea-
ture. The photos you imported are readily available too and are grouped in 
the same albums they were in on the computer.
	
Moreover, as part of iOS 8, every picture you take with your iPad (and other 
iOS 8 devices) can be stored in a new iCloud photo library. You can access 
any of these pics if you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to the Internet. No 
more fretting about images hogging too much storage space on your tablet. 
What’s more, the pictures are stored in the cloud at their full resolution in 
their original formats. (Apple will leave behind versions that are ideally sized 
for your tablet.)
You can still download to the iPad images that you want available when 
you’re not connected to cyberspace.
In this section, we show you not only where to find these pictures but also 
how to display them and share them with others — and how to dispose of 
the duds that don’t measure up to 
your lofty photographic standards.
Get ready to literally get your fingers 
on the pics (without having to worry 
about smudging them). Open the 
Photos app by tapping its icon on 
the Home screen or by going through 
the Camera app. Then take a gander 
at the trio of buttons at the bottom 
of the screen: Photos, Shared, 
Albums, as shown in Figure 9-2. We 
take these on one by one.
Choosing albums
Tapping Albums lists all the albums 
you have on your iPad, with your 
camera roll (refer to Figure 9-2) at 
the upper left. Apple has kindly sup-
plied additional premade albums: 
Panoramas, for all the panoramic 
scenes you’ve captured (on other 
Figure 9-2: Camera Roll tops your list of albums.

171
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
devices), Bursts for, well, your burst pictures, Videos (shooting videos 
is described in Chapter 8), and Recently Deleted, to give you a chance to 
recover any images that were accidentally given the heave-ho. Apple also dis-
plays the number of days before those pictures are permanently gone.
Albums that were synced from your Mac carry the From My Mac tag. These 
include the Events album and the Faces album, which used to have dedicated 
buttons in iOS, but no more. Another album that used to have its own dedi-
cated button is Places.
Tap an album listing to open it. When 
you do, you see the minimalistic 
interface shown in Figure 9-3, which 
reveals the by-now-familiar Camera 
Roll album.
Browse the thumbnails until you find 
the picture or video you want, and 
then tap it. We soon show you all the 
cool things you can do from there.
	
You’ll know when a thumbnail repre-
sents a video rather than a still 
image because the thumbnail dis-
plays a tiny movie camera icon 
accompanied by the length of the 
video. Or you’ll see a hatched circle, 
which represents video captured 
using the time lapse feature, a topic 
reserved for Chapter 8.
Meanwhile, you can tell whether 
a photo is part of a burst binge 
in a couple ways. The first way is 
exposed here in the camera roll. 
The thumbnail that represents 
this sequence of shots will appear 
as though it’s sitting on a stack of 
photos. (You’ll see this thumbnail 
stack also when you come to col-
lections view in the Photos app; we 
describe collections shortly.) Tap the 
thumbnail now. In the second way, 
the word Burst appears in the upper left of an image you’ve opened, with a 
numerical count of burst photos in parentheses.
Figure 9-3: Digging into the camera roll.

172
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
If you can’t locate the thumbnail for a photo you have in mind, flick up or 
down to scroll through the pictures rapidly, or use a slower dragging motion 
to pore through the images more deliberately. We’re certain you’ll find the 
one you’re looking for soon enough.
To return to the list of albums, tap Albums at the upper-left corner of the 
screen. After backing out, you can create an album from the albums view by 
tapping the + in the upper-left corner (refer to Figure 9-2), typing a name for 
the album, and tapping Save. To select pictures (or videos) to add to your 
newly minted album, tap their thumbnails.
Shortly, we show you how to add pictures to an existing album.
	
Albums you create on the iPad reside only on the iPad. They can’t be synced 
or copied to your PC or Mac, at least without work-arounds through a third-
party app such as Dropbox.
Categorizing your pics
Placing pictures into photo albums seems to us like it’s been the way of 
the world forever. But albums per se are not the only organizing struc-
ture that makes sense. As part of iOS 7, Apple cooked up a simple but 
ingenious interface for presenting pictures that is essentially a timeline of 
pictures, grouped by years, collections, and moments. iOS 8 follows the 
same path.
Pictures categorized by years are indeed all the pictures taken in a given year. 
Can’t be more straightforward than that.
The collections category is a subset within a year, such as your holi-
day pictures in Las Vegas. Within that grouping is another subset called 
moments — the pictures, say, that you took by the dancing fountains at the 
Bellagio Hotel.
Figure 9-4 shows side-by-side-by-side views of these groupings, which appear 
as a grid of Lilliputian thumbnails in the case of years — you can barely make 
out any of the pictures.
Tap the years view (Figure 9-4, left), and slightly bigger thumbnails appear 
as part of the collections view (Figure 9-4, center). Tap again, and the 
thumbnails get just a little bit bigger in the moments view (Figure 9-4, 
right).

173
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
Figure 9-4: View your photos by years (left), collections (center), and moments (right).
Through all these views, you’ll 
see location information headings 
that get a tad more specific as you 
move from years to collections to 
moments, assuming your iPad knows 
where the pictures were taken. 
(Location Services must be turned 
on under Privacy Settings for your 
iPad to know where these images 
were captured.) If you tap a place 
location, Apple will fire up a map and 
show you how many pictures were 
taken in that location, as revealed in 
Figure 9-5.
To quickly skim all the pictures in 
the years view, press and drag your 
finger across the grid — as you do 
so, the thumbnails swell in size, one 
by one. Lift your finger and that last 
thumbnail takes over a chunk of the 
screen, ready for you to admire it, 
edit it, or share it.
You can also tap a thumbnail in moments view to see controls for editing the 
picture (upper right), sharing it (bottom left), or discarding it (bottom right), 
as shown in Figure 9-6. Tap again and those picture controls disappear and 
the picture is bordered on the top and bottom by black bars.
Figure 9-5: Finding pictures on a map.

174
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
Apple summarizes photos in the col-
lections and years views by showing 
you only a representative sample for 
those collections and years. To see 
every photo in your library that fits 
those views, go to Settings➪Photos 
& Camera and turn off Summarize 
Photos by tapping the switch to 
make it gray.
Organizing your places, 
faces, and events
You’ve seen how pictures on the 
iPad mini can be organized into 
albums, years, collections, and 
moments. The iPad also supports 
the nifty faces and events features, 
which are familiar to Mac owners 
who use iPhoto software. Faces and 
events that show up in your list of 
albums are accompanied by the 
words From My Mac.
Consult Chapter 3 on 
syncing for a refresher 
on getting data to and 
from a computer to 
your iPad and back, a 
process that is even 
simpler through iCloud. 
When the iPad is con-
nected to a Mac, you 
can sync photo events 
(pictures taken around 
birthdays, anniversa-
ries, and so on) or faces 
(all the shots taken with 
a particular person in 
them). In Figure 9-7, all 
the pictures have Ed’s 
mug in them.
The faces feature requires that you sync to the iPhone with iPhoto or 
Aperture on a Mac.

photo.

 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
Searching for pictures
	
iOS 8 has one more feature to help you find a given photo among the thou-
sands if not tens of thousands you’ve shot. You can search your entire photo 
library in the cloud. From the Photos app, tap the search icon, the one that 
resembles a magnifying glass.
Apple has kindly grouped some of your pictures into potentially helpful 
search categories: Nearby, Home, those taken from a specific time period or 
location, and Favorites, which are so designated each time you tap the heart 
icon above a chosen image. You can also consult a Recent Searches grouping. 
Or just type a search term with the on-screen keyboard, perhaps the date or 
the time a photo was taken or the location where it was shot.
Sharing your photos
Apple in its infinite wisdom recognizes that you might want to share your 
best images with friends and family and have those pictures automatically 
appear on those people’s devices.
An impressive and aptly named solution called shared photo streams arrived 
on the iPad, iPod touch, and iPhone with iOS 6 (and a bit earlier on Macs run-
ning OS X Mountain Lion). It was modified in iOS 7 and is now referred to as 
iCloud photo sharing. The feature enables you to share pictures and videos 
with other folks and lets you in kind receive photo streams that other people 
make available to you. Here’s how:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap Settings.
	
2.	Tap Photos & Camera.
	
3.	If the iCloud Photo Sharing option isn’t on (green), tap it to turn it on.
	
4.	Open the Photos app, and then tap the Shared tab.
	
5.	Tap the + at the upper-left corner of the screen, and then type a name 
for your stream in the iCloud dialog that appears.
	
	 The name is your call, but we recommend something descriptive, along 
the lines of My Trip to Paris (and you should be so lucky).
	
6.	Tap Next and choose who will receive your 
stream, as shown in Figure 9-8.
	
	 You can type a phone number, a text 
address, or an email address, or choose one 
of your contacts by tapping the + in a circle 
in the To field of the iCloud pop-up window.
	
7.	Above the To field, tap Create.
Figure 9-8: Inviting people to 
share your iCloud photos.

176
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
8.	Add photos as follows:
	
a.	Make sure the Shared icon is selected, and then tap the selected 
stream.
	
b.	Now make sure the Photos tab at the bottom of the display is 
selected, and then tap each photo you want to include. You can 
choose from years, collections, or moments.
	
c.	Tap Done.
	
9.	(Optional) Enter a comment.
	
10.	Tap Post.
	
	 The recipient will receive an email similar to the one in Figure 9-9 and can 
choose to subscribe to your shared album by tapping the button shown.
	
We recommend 
checking out the 
activity view at 
the top of the 
Shared tab. It pro-
vides a nice sum-
mary of photos 
you and your 
pals posted.
You can share 
photos and 
videos with 
pretty much 
anyone who 
has online 
access — people 
don’t need to 
join iCloud. If you want to share your pictures with everyone, you can do 
so through a public gallery on iCloud.com. To do that, tap the Shared icon 
at the bottom of the Photos app and then tap the iCloud pictures in ques-
tion. This time, tap People near the upper-right corner of the screen, and 
then flip the Public Website switch to on (green).
If the people with whom you’re sharing have their own iCloud accounts and 
have iOS 6 or later on a device or are using a Macintosh computer running 
OS X Mountain Lion, Mavericks, or Yosemite, they can not only glom onto 
your stream to view your photos but also leave comments about them. Don’t 
worry — you have the power to remove snarky remarks.
Figure 9-9: Inviting a friend to share pictures.

177
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
If the people you’re sharing with have iOS 7 or iOS 8, they can add their own 
photos and videos to the stream, provided doing so is okay with you. If it is, 
turn on the Subscribers Can Post switch. At your discretion, you can also 
receive notifications when your subscribers weigh in with a comment or add 
their own pictures or videos to the shared stream. After tapping the People 
tab, you can invite more people to view your stream.
If you’re ultimately unhappy with the shared stream itself or the people with 
whom you’re sharing it, you can kill the shared stream or kick those people 
off the list. To kill the stream, select it, tap the Edit button, and tap the circled 
X that appears on the thumbnail image that represents the given stream. To 
remove a subscriber, tap the stream, tap People, and then tap the name of 
the person with whom you’re sharing the stream. Scroll down to the bottom 
and tap Remove Subscriber. You’ll be asked to tap a Remove button just to 
make sure or tap Cancel if you have second thoughts. If you do remove a sub-
scriber, you can always re-invite the person later.
Admiring Your Pictures
Photographs are meant to be seen, of course, not buried in the digital equiva-
lent of a shoebox. The iPad mini affords you some neat ways to manipulate, 
view, and share your best photos.
Maneuvering and manipulating photos
You’ve already found out how to find individual pictures in albums, via 
iCloud, and in years, collections, and moments groupings. You may already 
know (from previous sections in this chapter) how to display picture con-
trols. But you can do a lot of maneuvering of your pictures without summon-
ing those controls. Here are some options:
	
✓	Skip ahead or view the preceding picture: From a moments or album 
view, flick your finger left or right.
	
✓	Switch from landscape or portrait mode: The iPad mini’s cool sensors 
are at work. When you turn the iPad sideways, the picture automati-
cally reorients itself from portrait to landscape mode, as the images in 
Figure 9-10 show. Rotate the device back to portrait mode and the pic-
ture readjusts accordingly.
	
✓	Zoom: Double-tap to zoom in on an image and make it larger. Do so 
again to zoom out and make it smaller. Alternatively, on the photo, pinch 
your thumb and index finger together to zoom out and unpinch them to 
zoom in.

178
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Figure 9-10: The same picture in portrait (left) and landscape (right) modes.
	
✓	Pan and scroll: This cool little feature was once practically guaranteed 
to make you the life of the party. Now it’s commonplace if no less cool. 
After you zoom in on a picture, drag it around the screen with your 
finger, bringing front and center the part of the image you most care 
about. In this way, you can zoom in on Fido’s adorable face as opposed 
to, say, the unflattering picture of the person holding the dog in his lap.
Launching slideshows
Those of us who store a lot of photographs on computers are familiar with 
running slideshows of those images. It’s a breeze to replicate the experience 
on the iPad:
	
1.	Choose an album in the albums list.
	
	 To do so, tap the Photos icon from the Home screen or tap the Recently 
Added button in the Camera app.
	
2.	Do one of the following:
	
•	In the Photos app: Select an album and tap Slideshow in the upper-
right corner. You’ve designated every photo (and for that matter, 
video) in that album to be part of the slideshow.
	
	To cherry-pick the pictures you want to include in the slideshow, 
tap Select and then tap each image you want to include so that a 
check mark appears. Under this scenario, tap Add To and then add 
the chosen images to a new or an existing album. When that album 
is readily loaded, skip to the next step.

179
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
•	In the Camera app: Tap the image in the lower-right corner of the 
screen to display the most recent image you’ve shot, and find a 
picture to include in your slideshow. From there, follow the instruc-
tions for the Photos app to tap and choose other images for the 
slideshow or to choose an entire album.
	
3.	Tap Slideshow.
	
	 You’re taken to the Slideshow Options screen.
	
4.	Choose transition effects and the music (if any) that you’d like to 
accompany the slideshow.
	
	 You have six transitions choices (cube, dissolve, origami, ripple, wipe 
across, wipe down). Why not try them all, to see what you like? You can 
choose the music from your iTunes stash.
	
5.	Choose where you get to see the slideshow.
	
	 You can view the slideshow on the iPad mini itself or have it beamed 
wirelessly to an Apple TV, should you own Apple’s $99 set-top box.
	
6.	Tap Start Slideshow.
	
	 The slideshow ends automatically, unless you’ve set it to repeat, as 
explained in the next section. Tap the screen to end it prematurely.
That’s it! Enjoy the show.
You can alter the length of time each slide is shown, change the transition 
effects between pictures, and display images in random order.
From the Home screen, tap Settings and then scroll down and tap Photos & 
Camera. Then tap any of the following to make changes:
	
✓	Play Each Slide For: You have five choices (2 seconds, 3 seconds, 
5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds). When you’re finished, tap Photos & 
Camera to return to the main Settings screen for Photos.
	
✓	Repeat: If this option is turned on, the slideshow continues to loop until 
you stop it. If it’s turned off, the slideshow for your album plays just 
once.
	
✓	Shuffle: Turning on this switch plays slides in random order.
Press the Home button to leave the settings and return to the Home screen.
Storing pictures in the (i)Cloud
As mentioned, through the iCloud service, any photo you take with the iPad 
or with another iOS 8 device can be automatically stored in the cloud and 
pushed to another iPad, or your PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod touch, or Apple TV 

180
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
(third generation or later). The transfer is the antidote to the endless prob-
lem, “I’ve snapped a picture, now what?” Pictures are uploaded when your 
iCloud devices are connected to Wi-Fi.
What’s more, you need no longer fret about storage space when using iCloud 
photo library, which was still in beta, or test mode, as this book was being pub-
lished. Apple used to store the last 1,000 pictures you took over a 30-day period 
in a special album — enough time, Apple figured, for all your devices to connect 
and grab those images, because a Wi-Fi connection was your only requirement. 
All the pictures you took remained on your PC or Mac, because those machines 
had more capacious storage. Thanks to iCloud photo library, the 1,000-picture 
limit on iOS devices no longer applies. Again, you can always manually move 
images from the shared album into other albums on your iPad or other iOS 
devices and computers, should you want to view those pictures when you don’t 
have an Internet connection.
	
There’s a catch to using the iCloud photo library: You have to pay for stor-
age. You get 5GB of iCloud storage gratis, but shutterbugs will use that 
amount in a flash. You can get 25GB of storage (which includes the 5GB free) 
for 99¢ a month, 200GB for $3.99 a month, 500GB for $9.99 a month, and 1 
terabyte for $19.99 a month.
Photos taken on the iPad aren’t whisked to iCloud until you leave the Camera 
app. In that way, you get a chance to delete pictures that you’d rather not 
have turn up everywhere. But after you leave the Camera app, all the photos 
there are saved in the Camera Roll album (in the list of Albums in the Photos 
app), including pictures that arrived as email attachments that you saved as 
well as screen captures taken on the iPad. We found this last feature handy 
when writing this book.
You can save pictures in the Camera Roll album to any other album on the 
tablet. Start by tapping the Select button at the upper-right corner of the 
screen. Next, tap each photo you want to move. Tap the Add To button that 
shows up at the top of the screen and choose the new album destination for 
your chosen images.
	
If for some reason the pictures you snap on the iPad mini are not uploaded, 
go to Settings, scroll down and tap Photos & Camera, and make sure My 
Photo Stream is turned on.
Editing and Deleting Photos
The iPad is never going to serve as a substitute for a high-end photo-editing 
program such as Adobe Photoshop. But you can dramatically (and simply) 
apply touch-ups and alter the composition of your pictures right from the 
Photos app. And Apple refined the editing process in iOS 8.

181
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
To start, choose an image and tap Edit. You’ll see the Edit Photo screen, as 
Figure 9-11, left, reveals.
Figure 9-11: Who says you can’t improve the quality of the picture?
The screen sports the following icons, from left to right:
	
✓	Auto-enhance: Tapping the icon to the right of Cancel lets the iPad take 
a stab at making your image look better. Apple lightens or darkens the 
picture, tweaks color saturation, and more. Repeatedly tap the icon to 
turn this tool on or off. Tap Done if you like the result.
	
✓	Rotate, straighten and crop: Tapping this icon summons a number of 
additional icons and controls, as shown in Figure 9-11, center. You can
	
•	Straighten a crooked image or vice versa. Rotate the numbered dial 
and watch the effect on the photo. Click Done when you’re satis-
fied with how the image looks.
	
•	Rotate the entire image counterclockwise.
	
•	Crop the image. Tap the crop icon, and choose among the various 
aspect ratio options. Press your finger against the image to drag 
the photo around a crop grid to get it just as you would like, pinch-
ing and unpinching as you see fit to get closer up or farther away. 
When you’re satisfied with the result, tap Crop and then tap Save. 
Or tap Cancel to revert to the original.
	
✓	Add a filter: You can choose a filter — Mono, Tonal, Noir, Fade, Chrome, 
Process, Transfer, and Instant — after the fact. If you’re not satisfied 
after applying a filter, tap None to go back to the original photo.
	
✓	Adjust light, color, B&W: Apple provides numerous editing controls to 
adjust exposure, highlights, shadows, brightness, contrast, and black

point (light); saturation, contrast, and cast (color); and intensity, neu-
trals, tone, and grain (B&W). For example, Figure 9-11, right, shows how 
you might change the look of a picture through the use of shadows.
	
If you aren’t satisfied with any of the edits that you’ve applied to your pic-
tures, you can always tap Revert to restore the original.
Apple now allows third-party app makers to make their own filters and edit-
ing tools readily accessible from the Photos app.
Okay, so we told a tiny fib by intimating that photographs are meant to be 
seen. We should have amended that statement by saying that some pictures 
are meant to be seen. Others, you can’t get rid of fast enough. Fortunately, 
the iPad makes it a cinch to bury the evidence:
	
1.	Tap the objectionable photograph.
	
2.	Tap to display the picture controls, if they’re not already displayed.
	
3.	Tap the trash can icon.
	
4.	Tap Delete Photo (or tap anywhere else to cancel, if you change your 
mind).
	
	 In an instant, the photo is mercifully disposed of. It’s also deleted from 
Photo Stream across all your devices.
More (Not So) Stupid Picture Tricks
	
	 You can take advantage of the photos on the iPad in a few more ways. In each 
case, you tap the picture and make sure the picture controls are displayed. 
Then tap the share icon, at the bottom left (and shown in the margin) to dis-
play the choices shown in Figure 9-12.
Here’s a rundown of each choice:
	
✓	AirDrop: AirDrop is a neat wireless method for sharing photos, videos, or 
other files with folks who happen to be nearby and also have an iOS 7- or 
iOS 8-capable device or a Mac running Yosemite. You turn on the feature in 
Control Center (see Chapter 2) and choose whether to make your iPad dis-
coverable to everyone or just contacts who are in the vicinity. Tap a photo 
to select it and then tap the icon representing the device owned by the 
person with whom you are trying to share the image (refer to Figure 9-12). 
That person will receive an invitation to accept the photograph or reject 
it on his or her device, an iPhone in the example shown in Figure 9-13. If 
the photo is accepted, the picture lands on the person’s phone almost 
immediately.

183
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
✓	Message: Apple and your 
provider support picture 
messaging through MMS 
(Multimedia Messaging 
Service). Tap the Message 
option, and the picture is 
embedded in your outgoing 
message; you merely need 
to enter the phone number, 
email address, or name of the 
person to whom you’re send-
ing the picture. If that person 
is also using an iOS 5 or later 
device, the photo will be 
sent as an iMessage, which 
doesn’t count against your 
texting allotment.
	
✓	Mail: Some photos are so 
precious that you just have 
to share them with family 
members and friends. When 
you tap Mail, the picture is 
embedded in the body of an 
outgoing email message. Use 
the virtual keyboard to enter 
the email addresses, subject 
line, and any comments you 
want to add — you know, 
something profound, such as “Isn’t this a great-looking photo?” After tap-
ping Send to whisk picture and accompanying message on their way, you 
have the option to change the image size (small, medium, or large) or 
keep the actual size. Consider the trade-offs: A smaller-sized image may 
get through any limits imposed by your or the recipient’s Internet ser-
vice provider or company. But if you can get the largest image through, 
you’ll give the recipient the full picture (forgive the pun) in all its glory. 
(Check out Chapter 5 for more info on using email.)
	
✓	iCloud Photo Sharing: You can post pics to a shared album.
	
✓	Twitter: Lots of people send pictures with their tweets these days. The 
iPad makes it a breeze. Tap Twitter and your picture is embedded in an 
outgoing tweet. Just add your words, sticking to Twitter’s character limit 
of 140, and tap Post.
	
✓	Facebook: Lots (and we mean lots) of people also share photos on the 
world’s largest social network. After your Facebook account is config-
ured, you too can post there from your iPad.
Figure 9-12: Look at what else I can do!

184
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
✓	Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo: 
If you’ve enabled a Chinese 
keyboard, you’ll see options for 
China’s own social networks.
	
✓	Flickr: The Yahoo!-owned ser-
vice is another popular photo-
sharing destination.
	
✓	Copy: Tap to copy the image 
and then paste it into an email 
or elsewhere.
	
✓	Slideshow: We discuss slide-
shows earlier in this chapter. 
Here is another starting point 
for a slideshow, which as you 
know, can be accompanied by 
an optional musical soundtrack.
	
✓	AirPlay: Own an Apple TV set-
top box? You can use AirPlay to 
stream photos from the tablet 
to the TV.
	
✓	Save Image: If you didn’t shoot 
the image in question on your 
iPad mini but want to add it to 
the device, tap the Save Image 
option.
	
✓	Assign to Contact: If you assign 
a picture to someone in your 
contacts list, the picture you 
assign pops up whenever you receive a FaceTime call or Message from 
that person. Tap Assign to Contact. Your list of contacts appears on 
the screen. Scroll through the list to find the person who matches the 
picture of the moment. As with the Use as Wallpaper option (described 
next), you can drag and resize the picture to get it just right. Then tap 
Set Photo.
	
	You can also assign a photo to a contact by starting out in Contacts. 
To change the picture you assigned to a person, tap his or her name in 
the contacts list, tap Edit, and then tap the person’s thumbnail picture, 
which also carries the label Edit. From there, you can take another 
photo with the iPad’s digital camera, select another photo from one of 
your albums, edit the photo you’re already using (by resizing and drag-
ging it to a new position), or delete the photo you no longer want.
Figure 9-13: AirDrop lets you share a picture 
wirelessly with a friend who is nearby.

 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
✓	Use as Wallpaper: The Apple-
supplied background images on 
the iPad mini can’t measure up 
to pictures of your spouse, your 
kids, or your pet. When you tap 
Use as Wallpaper, you see what 
the present image looks like as 
the mini’s background picture. 
You’re given the opportunity 
to move the picture around 
and resize it, through the now-
familiar action of dragging or 
pinching against the screen with 
your fingers. You can even see 
how the picture looks against 
the time and date that appear 
on the lock screen. Another 
option is to take advantage of 
the Perspective Zoom setting, 
which lets you exploit a parallax 
animation effect in which the 
picture moves as you move the 
iPad. Tap the screen to toggle 
the setting on or off. When 
you’re satisfied with what the wallpaper looks like, tap the Set button. 
Options appear that let you use the photo as wallpaper for the lock 
screen, the Home screen, or both, as shown in Figure 9-14. Per usual, you 
can also tap Cancel. (You find out more about wallpaper in Chapter 15.)
	
✓	Print: If you have an AirPrint-capable printer, tap Print to print the 
photo. You can choose how many copies of the print you want to 
duplicate.
	
	 Sometimes you want to make decisions about multiple pictures at the same 
time, whether you’re sharing them online, copying or printing them, adding 
them to a new album, or deleting them in bulk. Here’s a convenient way to 
do so. Launch the Photos app and either tap a specific album in the app or 
open up to a moments view so that you see thumbnails of your pictures. 
Next, tap Select at the upper right, and then tap each thumbnail on which 
you’re planning to take action, so that a check mark appears. As you do, the 
count for each picture you select increases. From here, you can tap the share 
icon (shown in the margin) to share pictures on a social network in bulk, 
email them, send them via a message, or copy or print them, as discussed 
previously. The options that appear may vary depending on how many pic-
tures you’ve selected — for example, the number of photos you can email is 
limited.
Figure 9-14: Beautifying the iPad with 
wallpaper.

186
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
You won’t have to tap the share icon in every case to add pictures to a desig-
nated album or to delete them. After making your picture selections, look for 
Add To and the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen. Tap Add To and 
then, from the list that appears, tap the album where you want the pictures 
you’ve chosen to land. If you tap the trash can icon instead, you can dispose 
of the selected photos.
Entering the Photo Booth
Remember the old-fashioned photo booths at the local Five and Dime? 
Remember the Five and Dime? Okay, if you don’t remember such variety 
stores, your parents probably do, and if they don’t, their parents no doubt 
do. The point is that photo booths (which do still exist) are fun places to ham 
it up solo or with a friend as the machine captures and spits out wallet-size 
pictures.
With the Photo Booth app, Apple has cooked up a modern alternative to a 
real photo booth. The app is a close cousin to a similar application on the 
Mac. Here’s how Photo Booth works:
	
1.	Tap the Photo Booth icon.
	
	 You get the tic-tac-toe-style grid shown in Figure 9-15.
	
2.	Point the front-facing camera at your face.
	
	 You see your mug through a prism of eight rather wacky special effects: 
Thermal Camera, Mirror, X-Ray, Kaleidoscope, Light Tunnel, Squeeze, 
Twirl, and Stretch. The center square (what is this, Hollywood Squares?) 
is the only one in which you come off looking normal — or, as we like 
to kid, like you’re supposed to look. Some of the effects make you look 
scary; some, merely goofy.
	
	 You can also use the rear camera in Photo Booth to subject your friends 
to this form of, um, visual abuse.
	
3.	Choose one of the special effects (or stick with Normal) by tapping 
one of the thumbnails.
	
	 Ed chose Mirror for the example shown in Figure 9-16 because, after all, 
two Eds are better than one. (Sorry, couldn’t resist.) You can pinch or 
unpinch the image to further doctor the effect.
	
	 If you’re not satisfied with the effect you’ve chosen, tap the icon at the 
lower-left corner of the app to return to the Photo Booth grid and select 
another.

187
 Chapter 9: Photography on a Larger Scale
	
4.	When you have your bizarre look just right, tap the camera button on 
the screen to snap the picture.
	
	 Your pic lands (as do other pictures taken with the iPad cameras) in the 
Camera Roll album.
From the Camera Roll album or from right here in Photo Booth, pictures can 
be shared in all the usual places or deleted, which you might want to seri-
ously consider, given the distortions you’ve just applied to your face.
Nah, we’re only kidding. Keep the image and take a lot more. Photo Booth 
may be a blast from the past, but we think it’s just a blast.
	
Before leaving this photography section, we want to steer you to the App 
Store, which we explore in greater depth in Chapter 11. Hundreds, probably 
thousands, of photography-related apps are available there, a whole host of 
them free. That’s too many to mention here, but we know you’ll find terrific 
photo apps just by wandering around the place. Head to the Photo & Video 
category to get started.
And there you have it. You have just passed Photography 101 on the iPad 
mini. We trust that the coursework was, forgive another pun, a snap.

like this.

Curling Up with a Good iBook
In This Chapter

▶	Opening up to iBooks
▶	Reading books
▶	Shopping for iBooks
▶	Reading electronic periodicals
D
 
on’t be surprised if you have to answer this question from an inquisi-
tive child someday: “Is it true, Grandpa, that people once read books 
on paper?”
That time may still be a ways off, but it somehow doesn’t seem far-fetched 
anymore. Apple is among the tech companies that are major pro-
ponents of the electronic-books revolution.
Don’t get us wrong; we love physical books as much 
as anyone and are in no way urging their imminent 
demise. But we also recognize the real-world benefits 
behind Apple’s digital publishing efforts — and 
those by companies such as Amazon (which manu-
factures what is, for now, the market-leading Kindle 
electronic reader). As you discover in this chapter, 
the Kindle plays a role on the iPad mini as well.
For its part, the iPad mini makes a terrific electronic 
reader, with its compact portability, color, and daz-
zling special effects, including pages that turn like those 
in a real book.
We open the page on this chapter to see how to find and pur-
chase books for your mini, and how to read them after they land on 
your virtual bookshelf. But first, we look at why you might want to read 
books and periodicals on your iPad.

190
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Why E-Books?
We’ve run into plenty of skeptics who ask, “What’s so wrong with the paper 
books that folks have only been reading for centuries that we now have 
to go digital?” The short answer is that nothing is wrong with physical 
books — except maybe that paper, over the long term, is fragile, and paper 
books tend to be bulky, a potential impediment for travelers.
On the other hand, when asked why he prefers paper books, Bob likes to 
drop one from shoulder height and ask, “Can your iPad (or Kindle) do that?”
Having said that, though, now consider the electronic advantages:
	
✓	No more weight or bulk constraints: You can cart a whole bunch of 
e-books around when you travel, without breaking your back. To the 
avid bookworm, this potentially changes the dynamic in the way you 
read. Because you can carry so many books wherever you go, you can 
read whatever type of book strikes your fancy at the moment, kind of 
like listening to a song that fits your current mood. You have no obliga-
tion to read a book from start to finish before opening a new bestseller 
just because that happens to be the one book you have in your bag. In 
other words, weight constraints are out the window.
	
✓	Feel like reading a trashy novel? Go for it. Rather immerse yourself in 
classic literature? Go for that. You might read a textbook, cookbook, or 
biography. Or gaze in wonder at an illustrated beauty. What’s more, you 
can switch among the various titles and styles of books at will before 
finishing any single title.
	
✓	Flexible fonts and type sizes: With e-books, or what Apple prefers to 
call iBooks, you can change the text size and fonts on the fly — quite 
useful for people with less than 20/20 vision.
	
✓	Get the meaning of a word on the spot: No more searching for a physi-
cal dictionary. You can look up an unfamiliar word immediately.
	
✓	Search with ease: Need to do research on a particular subject? Enter 
a search term to find every mention of the subject in the book you’re 
reading.
	
✓	See all the artwork in color: See your iBook the way it was meant to be 
seen. For example, the latest iBooks software from Apple lets you experi-
ence (within certain limits) the kind of stunning art book once reserved 
for a coffee table. Or you can display a colorful children’s picture book. 
And the newest multitouch iBooks incorporate embedded videos, ani-
mations, 3D elements, narration, and more.
	
✓	Read in the dark: The iPad mini has a high-resolution backlit display so 
that you can read without a lamp nearby, which is useful in bed when 
your partner is trying to sleep.

191
 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
Truth is, this backlit story has two sides. The grayscale electronic ink dis-
plays found on Amazon’s Kindle and several other e-readers may be easier 
on the eyes and reduce fatigue, especially if you read for hours on end. And 
although you may indeed have to supply your own lighting source to read in 
low-light situations, at least on some of the devices, those screens are easier 
to see than the iPad screen when you’re out and about in bright sunshine. 
And some newer e-ink-type readers include displays that do light up.
	
You can buy an iBook by using iTunes on your Mac or PC, and you can now 
read that book on your Mac. You can also read iBooks on an iPhone, iPad, or 
iPod touch.
Beginning the iBook Story
To start reading iBooks on your iPad mini, you have to fetch the iBooks app 
in the App Store. (For more on the App Store, consult Chapter 11.)
As you might imagine, the app is free, and it comes with access to Apple’s 
iBooks Store, of which we have more to say later in this chapter. For now, just 
know that the iBooks Store is an inviting place to browse and shop for books 
24 hours a day. All the other books you end up purchasing for your iPad 
library turn up in the cover view shown in Figure 10-1 or in a view that lists 
your books by title.
The following basics help you navigate the iBooks main screen:
	
✓	Change the view: If you prefer to view a list of your book titles rather 
than use cover view, tap the change view icon at the upper-left corner of 
the screen (labeled in Figure 10-1). In cover view, you can sort the list by 
most recent, titles, authors, or categories, as shown in Figure 10-2.
	
✓	Remove a book from view: In cover view, tap Select, and then tap the 
book covers that you want to remove or tap Select All. Each selected 
book displays a check mark; tap a cover again to remove its check mark 
and thus deselect the book. When all the books you want to delete have 
check marks, tap Delete in the upper-left corner of the display. Apple 
asks you to tap a Delete This Copy or Delete These Copies button.
	
	In list mode, as we like to call it, tap Select as well. This time, blank cir-
cles appear next to each title in the list. Tap the circle for each book you 
want to remove so that a check mark appears, and then tap Delete in the 
upper left. As before, you must confirm by tapping Delete This Copy or 
Delete These Copies.

192
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Figure 10-1: You can read a book by its cover.
	
	As with other content you purchase from Apple, you can restore (down-
load) any book you’ve purchased by tapping the Purchased icon at the 
bottom of the screen in the iBooks Store. The books you purchase from 
the iBooks Store land in iCloud. You’ll know a book is in the cloud (as 
opposed to being downloaded onto your iPad mini) when you see the 
small iCloud icon. Tap that icon to download the book. If you prefer, you 
can hide books that are in iCloud from your iPad. Tap All Books, and 
then tap the Hide iCloud Books switch.
	
✓	Organize books by collections: If you have a vast library of e-books, you 
might want to organize titles by genre or subject by creating collections 
of like-minded works. You might have collections of mysteries, classics, 
biographies, children’s books, how-to’s, textbooks, even all the For 
Dummies books (we hope) you own.

193
 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
	
	Apple has created two collec-
tions on your behalf: Books for 
all titles and PDFs for the Adobe 
PDF files on your mini. (Apple 
doesn’t let you edit or remove 
the premade Books or PDFs 
collections.) To create, rename, 
or remove a collection of your 
own, tap All Books (labeled in 
Figure 10-1) to show off your 
current list of collections and 
then choose from the following 
tasks:
	
•	Add a collection: Tap + New 
Collection and type a name 
for the new collection.
	
•	Delete a collection: Tap 
Edit and the red circle, and 
then tap Delete to finish 
the job. If the collection 
contains books, you’re 
asked whether you want 
to remove the contents of 
this collection from your iPad. If you choose not to remove them, 
they’re returned to their original collections (Books, PDFs, or any 
other collection).
	
•	Rename a collection: Tap its name and type a new name. As we 
mention, you can’t rename the Books or PDFs collection.
	
•	Move a book or PDF to a new collection: Go to the cover or list 
views tap Select, tap each work you want to move, and then tap 
Move. Select the new collection for these titles.
	
A book can reside in only one collection at a time.
Here we are telling you how to move or get rid of a book before you’ve even 
had a chance to read it. How gauche. The next section helps you start reading.
Reading a Book
To start reading a book, tap it. The book leaps forward and opens to either 
the beginning or the place where you left off. (And you may have left off on an 
iPhone, an iPod touch, or maybe a bigger-sized iPad because, through your 
Apple ID, your virtual place in a book is transported from device to device as 
long as the devices have an Internet connection.)
Figure 10-2: Sort a list of your books by most 
recent, title, author, or category.

194
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
Even from the very title page, you 
can appreciate the color and beauty 
of Apple’s app as well as the naviga-
tion tools, as shown in Figure 10-3.
If you rotate the iPad to the side, 
the one-page book view becomes a 
two-page view, but the navigational 
controls remain the same. On newer 
multitouch books, you may have a 
scrolling view of a book rather than 
the typical one-page view.
	
While you’re lounging around read-
ing, and especially if you’re lying 
down, we recommend that you use 
the screen orientation lock (see 
Chapter 1) to stop the mini from 
inadvertently rotating the display.
You can take advantage of the iPad’s 
VoiceOver feature to have the mini 
read to you out loud. The feature 
may not be quite like having Mom 
or Dad read you to sleep but can 
be a potential godsend for people 
with impaired vision. For more 
on the VoiceOver feature, consult 
Chapter 15.
	
The VoiceOver feature is useful under certain circumstances. But we’re not at 
the point where the iPad’s loquacious virtual assistant Siri can read a book 
out loud. Maybe someday. For now, Siri can open the iBooks app, though. 
Read Chapter 14 for more on Siri.
Turning pages
You’ve been turning pages in books your entire life, so you don’t want this 
simple feat to become a complicated ordeal just because you’re reading elec-
tronically. Fear not; it’s not.
You have no buttons to press. Instead, to turn to the next page of a book, do 
any of the following:
	
✓	Tap or flick your finger near the right of the page. The page turns in a 
blink.
	
✓	Drag your finger near the right margin. The page folds down as it 
turns, as if you were turning pages in a real book.
Figure 10-3: Books on the iPad mini offer handy 
reading and navigation tools.

195
 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
	
✓	Drag down from the upper-right corner of the book. The page curls 
from that spot. The effect is so authentic, you can make out the faint 
type bleeding from the previous page on the next folded-down page.
	
✓	Drag up from the lower-right corner. The page curls up from that spot.
	
✓	Drag from the middle-right margin. The entire page curls.
To turn to the previous page in a book, tap, flick, or drag your finger in a 
similar fashion, except now do so closer to the left margin. You’ll witness the 
same cool page-turning effects.
	
That’s what happens by default anyway. Tap Settings➪iBooks; you have the 
option to go to the next page instead of the previous page when you tap near 
the left margin. So tapping either margin would advance you to the next page.
You can also flick to scroll through a book vertically rather than turning 
pages in portrait view. Tap the font icon (little A and big A), and then flip the 
Scrolling View switch.
While in Settings, you can also flip switches that turn on (or off) full justi-
fication, leading to neat edges on both sides of a book that you’re reading. 
There’s also a setting to turn on auto-hyphenation.
	
The iPad is smart, remembering where you left off. So if you close a book by 
tapping the Library button in the upper-left corner or by pressing the main 
Home button, you automatically return to this page when you reopen the book. 
It isn’t necessary to bookmark the page (though you can, as we describe later 
in this chapter). The one proviso: You need an Internet connection when you 
close the book, because otherwise the server at Apple doesn’t get the new 
bookmark info to pass on when you open the book on another device. And sim-
ilarly, you need an Internet connection when you reopen the book to retrieve 
the information that was passed on.
Jumping to a specific page
When you’re reading a book, you often want to go to a specific page. Here’s 
how:
	
1.	If the page navigator controls aren’t visible, summon them by tapping 
near the center of the page you’re reading.
	
	 The controls are labeled in Figure 10-3.
	
2.	Drag your finger along the slider at the bottom of the screen until the 
chapter and page number you want appear.

196
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
3.	Release your finger and — voila — that’s where you are in the book.
	
	 Tap Back to Page xx at the bottom-left corner of the screen to return to 
your furthest point. Or tap Go to Page xx at the bottom right to return to 
a previous page you’ve read.
Going to the table of contents
Most books you read — on your mini and elsewhere — have a table of con-
tents. Here’s how you use a table of contents on your iPad:
	
1.	With a book open on your 
iPad, tap the table of contents/
list icon near the top of the 
screen (labeled in Figure 10-3).
	
	 The Table of Contents screen, as 
shown in Figure 10-4, appears.
	
2.	Tap the chapter, title page, or 
another entry to jump to that 
page.
	
	 Alternatively, tap the Resume 
button that appears at the 
upper-left corner of the screen 
to return to the previous loca-
tion in the book.
Adding bookmarks
Moving around to a particular loca-
tion on the iPad mini is almost as 
simple as moving around a real book, 
and as we explain in the earlier sec-
tion “Turning pages,” Apple kindly returns you to the last page you were 
reading when you closed a book.
Still, occasionally you want to bookmark a page so that you can easily return 
to it. To insert a bookmark somewhere, merely tap the bookmarks icon near 
the upper-right reaches of the screen. A red ribbon slides down over the top 
of the bookmarks icon, signifying that a bookmark is in place. Tap the ribbon 
if you want to remove the bookmark. Simple as that.
After you set a bookmark, here’s how to find it later:
	
1.	Tap the table of contents/list icon (labeled in Figure 10-3).
	
2.	Tap Bookmarks (if it’s not already selected).

 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
	
	 Your bookmark is listed along 
with the chapter and page cita-
tions, the date you bookmarked 
the page, and a phrase or two of 
surrounding text, as the exam-
ple in Figure 10-5 shows.
	
3.	Tap your desired bookmark to 
return to that page in the book.
You can remove a bookmark from 
the bookmarks list by swiping your 
finger to the left along the bookmark 
and then tapping the red Delete 
button that appears.
Adding highlights 
and notes
In addition to setting bookmarks 
to jump to pages you want to read 
again, you can highlight words or 
passages on a page as well as add 
annotations or comments, which 
is handy for school assignments. Pardon the pun, but Apple is on the same 
page. Here’s how to do both:
	
1.	Press and hold down against the text on a page. Then lift your finger 
to summon the Highlight and Note buttons.
	
	 These two buttons appear side by side, sandwiched along with Copy, 
Define, Share, and Search buttons, which we address in a moment.
	
	 You see grab points along the highlighted word.
	
2.	(Optional) Refine the highlighted section by adjusting the grab points.
	
3.	Tap one of the following to add a highlight or note:
	
•	Copy: The word or passage you select can be pasted someplace 
else.
	
•	Highlight: The word or passage you selected is highlighted in color. 
You can read the highlight later by returning to the table of con-
tents page in the same way that you find a bookmark. (See the pre-
ceding section and refer to Figure 10-5.)
	
•	Note: A Post-it–like note appears on the screen. Using the virtual 
keyboard, type your note.

bookmarked.

After you add a highlight or note, the following tips are handy to know:
	
✓	Remove a highlight or note. Tap the highlighted text or note, and on the 
toolbar that appears, tap the trash can icon. When the Delete Highlight 
dialog appears, confirm your choice by tapping Delete. Alternatively, from 
the Notes section in the table of contents page, swipe your finger from right 
to left along an entry and then tap the red Delete button that appears.
	
✓	Change the color of a highlight or note. You can change the color from 
the default yellow to green, blue, pink, or purple. Touch the highlighted 
selection for a moment and then lift your finger. From the toolbar, tap 
The iPad goes to school
Apple has been pushing iPads in K-12 and higher 
education. As part of its vision for the iPad 
and with iBooks 2 and beyond, the company is 
throwing its considerable weight behind digital 
textbooks, works that include interactive cap-
tions, quizzes, 3D objects, and video. Apple even 
unveiled free software for the Mac called iBooks 
Author to encourage teachers and others to pro-
duce their own interactive books for learning.
In the meantime, among the early high school 
textbooks produced for the iPad are titles that 
cover algebra, environmental sciences, phys-
ics, and other subjects.
E. O. Wilson’s Life on Earth is an especially 
rich interactive digital biology textbook like 
none you’ve seen, from 3D models of DNA to 
animated maps of global photosynthesis. The 
introduction to the book was made available 
for free, after which you were able to purchase 
additional chapters as they’re released, at $1.99 
apiece. Eventually, everything became free. (In 
general, publishers will have to work out pric-
ing on most emerging textbooks.) Wilson’s book 
could be viewed only by using iBooks 3.0 or 
later on an iPad running iOS 5.1 or later. (iBooks 
was up to iBooks 4.0 at the time of this writing.)
Meanwhile, if a book supports it, you can turn 
your notes into study cards — a great way for 
students to learn vocabulary or prepare for 
exams. (If the option is available, you’ll see an 
icon that looks like a notepad just to the right of 
the Table of Contents button.) You can swipe the 
cards to move from one to another, or tap a card 
to see one side with glossary terms or material 
you’ve highlighted and the other with any notes 
you’ve supplied. You’ll see an icon that looks like 
a small gear with a peace symbol inside it. Apple 
has the backing of such prominent textbook pub-
lishers as Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, McGraw-
Hill, and Pearson. What’s more, some third-party 
publishers such as Kno and Inkling are producing 
some interesting interactive textbooks.
According to Apple, hundreds of thousands of 
books in the iBooks Store can be used in school 
curriculums, including novels for English or 
social studies. A world of educational content 
is accessible also via the iTunes U app.
As you consider these various efforts, we 
understand if you wish you’d had an iPad mini 
with digital textbooks back when you were in 
school.
We should also point out that although edu-
cational materials are a main impetus behind 
iBooks 3, other books rich in audio, video, and 
other interactive materials take full advantage of 
Apple’s latest software. One example is George 
Harrison: Living In the Material World, a hand-
some $14.99 book written by the ex-Beatle’s  
widow, Olivia Harrison. You can view it only on 
an iPad with iBooks 2 or later.

the icon with the color that you prefer. You can underline a passage 
instead by tapping the icon with an underlined letter A. This icon is adja-
cent to the icons representing your color choices.
	
	
✓	Share or print notes. On the table of contents page, tap the share icon 
(shown in the margin) in the upper-right corner. Tap Mail to email your 
notes, or tap Print to print them (provided you have a compatible printer; 
see Chapter 2 for details about printing). You also have options to share 
via Messages, or to post on Twitter, Facebook, or Sina Weibo, the Chinese 
social network (if a Chinese keyboard is enabled). We don’t know how 
that will play politically in China. A third-party app sharing option may 
also present itself. Meanwhile, to see other possibilities for notes and 
iBooks generally, read the nearby sidebar “The iPad goes to school.”
	
With iBooks, you can sync bookmarks and notes, as well as your collections 
across all your devices (Macs, iPhones, iPod touches, and of course your 
iPad). But if you don’t want to do so, head to Settings and flip the switches to 
turn off these options.
Changing the type size, font, and page color
If you want to change the way a page looks, begin by tapping the Aa icon at 
the top right of the screen. You can then change the following:
	
✓	Typeface size: Tap the uppercase A or the lowercase a to make the text 
larger or smaller, respectively.
	
✓	Font: Tap Fonts, and then tap the font style you want to switch to. 
Your choices at this time are Athelas, Charter, Georgia, Iowan, Palatino, 
Seravek, and Times New Roman. We don’t necessarily expect you to 
know what these look like just by the font names — fortunately, you can 
examine the change right before your eyes. A check mark indicates the 
currently selected font style.
	
✓	Page color: Tap White (the default), Sepia, or Night. You can also flip 
an Auto-Night Theme switch to have the mini automatically choose the 
Night theme when you’re reading in the wee hours without the lights on.
	
✓	Brightness: And speaking of light, you can raise or lower the brightness 
of the screen as you read by dragging the slider.
Searching inside and outside a book
If you want to find a passage in a book but can’t remember where it is, try 
searching for it. Here’s how:
	
1.	Tap the search (magnifying glass) icon.
	
2.	Type your search term or page number on the virtual keyboard that 
slides up from the bottom.

200
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
	
	 All the occurrences in the book turn up in a window under the search 
icon, complete with a few lines of text and a page citation.
	
3.	Tap one of the items to jump to that portion of the book.
	
	 The words you were searching for are highlighted on that page.
You can also search the web (via Google or your chosen search engine) or 
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, by using the corresponding buttons at 
the bottom of the search results. If you do so, the iBooks app closes, and the 
Safari browser fires up Google or Wikipedia, with your search term already 
entered.
	
If you search Google or Wikipedia in this fashion, you are, for the moment, 
closing the iBooks app and opening Safari. To return to the book you’re read-
ing, you must reopen the app. Fortunately, you’re brought back to where you 
left off in the book. And Google is still the search choice through iBooks, even 
if you selected another search engine in Safari.
Shopping for E-Books
We love browsing in a physical bookstore, and the experience of browsing 
Apple’s iBooks Store is equally pleasurable. Apple makes it a cinch to search 
for books you want to read, and even lets you peruse a sample before parting  
with your hard-earned dollars. To enter the store from either the cover or 
library list view, tap one of the buttons at the bottom of the display: Featured, 
NYTimes, Top Charts, Top Authors, or Purchased. We explore these further 
shortly.
Meanwhile, a few things to keep in mind: The iBooks Store operates in at least 
155 countries as of this writing, with more than 2.5 million available books. 
Hundreds of millions of books have been downloaded. Not all books are avail-
able in all markets, of course. Some works — Jay-Z’s memoir Decoded, to take 
a single example — are enhanced with video. Meanwhile, the store includes 
titles from major trade publishers: Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, 
Macmillan, Penguin Group, Simon & Schuster, and Random House, as well as 
several independents. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., is also represented, of course.
Publishers, not Apple, set the prices. Many bestsellers in the joint cost $12.99, 
though some fetch $9.99 or less. Dear Life from Nobel Prize winner Alice Munro 
costs $11.99. Apple runs specials from time to time. Leading up to Halloween, 
for example, the store sold some picture books targeted at the trick-or-treating 
crowd for $3.99 or less, including Anne Hillerman’s Spider Woman’s Daughter, 
which once cost $15.99. Free selections are also available. Prices change all the 
time, so poke around for something you’ll find pleasurable to read and then 
decide whether the book is worth buying for the price.

 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
Just browsing the iBooks Store
You have several ways to browse for 
books in the iBooks Store. The top 
portion of the screen shows ever-
changing ads for books that fit a 
chosen category (Children & Teens 
in the example shown in Figure 10-6). 
But you can also browse Release Date 
in the particular category you have 
in mind. You can scroll to the left or 
right for more releases to peek at. Or 
tap See All for many more selections.
Look at the bottom of the screen. 
You see the following icons:
	
✓	Featured: This tab is where 
you’ve been hanging out so far 
in this chapter. Featured works 
are books being promoted in 
the store and may include popu-
lar titles or an author spotlight 
from the likes of The Hunger 
Games writer Suzanne Collins. 
In this Children & Teens exam-
ple, you’ll see books that are Hot 
This Week, as well as titles categorized by age (Kids 5 & Under, Kids 6-8, 
and so on). Swipe the featured books at the top of the screen for more 
choices. Do the same, if you want, for the Teen Fiction and Coming Soon 
sections. Or tap See All for more selections. Scroll all the way to the 
bottom of the screen for links to check out your iTunes account informa-
tion and redeem iTunes gift cards and gift certificates.
	
✓	NYTimes: Short for The New York Times, of course. These books make 
the newspaper’s famous bestsellers lists, which are divided into fiction 
and nonfiction works. The top books in each list are initially shown. 
Scroll down to see more titles.
	
✓	Top Charts: Here Apple shows you the most popular books in the iBooks 
Store. You find lists for Paid Books and Free Books. Scroll down to see 
more of the top books in each category.
	
✓	Top Authors: Tapping the Top Authors icon lets you find books by 
poring through a list of popular authors, shown in a scrollable pane on 
the left half of the screen. Flick your finger up or down to scroll the list, 
or tap one of the letters in the margin to jump to authors whose name 
begins with that letter. When you tap an author’s name, a list of his or 
her available titles appears in a scrollable pane on the right.

Teens.

✓	Purchased: Tapping here shows you the books you’ve already bought, 
which you can download onto your mini.
Searching the iBooks Store
In the upper-right corner of the iBooks Store is a search field, similar to the 
search field in iTunes. Tap the search field, and then use the virtual keyboard 
to type an author name or title to find the book you seek.
	
If you like freebies, search for free in the iBooks Store. You’ll find tons of 
(mostly classic) books that cost nothing, and you won’t even have to import 
them. See the section “Finding free books outside the iBooks Store,” later in 
this chapter, for more places to find free books. By Apple’s count, free con-
tent is distributed in 155 countries. Off the top of our heads, we can’t remem-
ber how many countries are on Planet Earth, but it’s fair to say that when it 
comes to digital books, Apple has most of them covered.
Deciding whether a book is worth it
To find out more about a book that you come across, you can check out the 
details page and other readers’ reviews or read a sample of the book:
	
✓	Find the book’s details. Tap its cover. An information screen appears 
with Details highlighted by default. You can see when the book was pub-
lished, read a description, see the number of pages, and more.
	
✓	Find ratings and reviews. Tap Reviews to see the grades other readers 
bestowed on the book. If you’ve already read the book, throw in your 
own two cents by tapping Write a Review.
	
✓	Find other books by the same author. Tap Related to see the covers of 
other books written by the author. You can also check out other books 
that customers who bought this book also bought.
	
✓	Share your interest in a book. Tap the share icon in the upper-right 
corner of the information screen. You can then sing the praises of a 
book by tapping icons for Message, Mail, Twitter, and Facebook, as well 
as Chinese social networks Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo (assuming 
you enabled a Chinese keyboard). You can also tap Copy Link or Gift (if 
you’re feeling generous).
The best thing you can do to determine whether a book is worth buying is 
to read a sample. Tap Sample, and the book cover almost immediately lands 
on your bookshelf. You can read it like any book, up until that juncture in the 
book where your free sample ends. Apple has placed a Buy button inside the 
pages of the book to make it easy to purchase it if you’re hooked. The word 
Sample is plastered on the cover on the bookshelf to remind you that this 
book isn’t yours — yet.

203
 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
Buying a book from the iBooks Store
When a book meets or exceeds your lofty standards and you’re ready to pur-
chase it, simply do the following:
	
1.	Tap the price shown in the button on the book’s information page.
	
	 Upon doing so, the dollar amount disappears, and the button carries 
a green Buy Book label. If you tap a free book instead, the button is 
labeled Get Book.
	
2.	Tap the Buy Book or Get Book button.
	
3.	Enter your iTunes password (if you’re prompted).
	
	 The book appears on your bookshelf in an instant, ready for you to tap it 
and start reading. You get an email receipt acknowledging your purchase 
via the same mail account in which you receive other receipts from 
iTunes for music, movies, and apps.
	
If you buy another book within 15 minutes of your initial purchase, you aren’t 
prompted for your iTunes password again.
On the iPad mini 3, which has the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, you can 
authorize the purchase of a book by pressing your finger against the Touch 
ID scanner when prompted.
Buying books beyond Apple
The business world is full of examples in which one company competes with 
another on some level, only to work with it as a partner on another level. 
When the original iPad first burst onto the scene in early April 2010, pundits 
immediately compared it to Amazon’s Kindle, the market-leading electronic 
reader. Sure, the iPad had the larger screen and color, but the Kindle had a 
few bragging points too, including a longer battery life (up to about a month 
on the latest Kindle, versus about 10 hours for the iPad), a lighter weight, and 
a larger selection of books in its online bookstore.
But Amazon has long said that it wants Kindle books to be available for 
all sorts of electronic platforms, and the iPad mini, like the full-sized iPad, 
iPhone and iPod touch before it, is no exception. So we recommend taking 
a look at the free Kindle app for the iPad, especially if you’ve already pur-
chased a number of books in Amazon Bookstore and want access to that 
wider selection of titles. The Barnes & Noble Nook app is also worth a look.
Competing against the iPad mini with smaller, less-expensive tablets are 
Barnes & Noble’s Nook Tablet and Amazon’s Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, 
and Kindle Fire HDX. Google is doing the same with the Nexus 7 tablet 
(with its Google Play Books app). And you can find numerous other play-
ers in the space.

204
Part III: The Multimedia iPad mini 
You can find several other e-book–type apps for the iPad in the App Store. To 
name a few:
	
✓	CloudReaders from Cloud Readers (free)
	
✓	Kobo Reading App – Read Books and Magazines by Kobo
	
✓	Bluefire Reader from Bluefire Productions
See Chapter 11 for details about finding and downloading apps.
Finding free books outside the iBooks Store
	
Apple supports a technical standard called ePub, which is the underlying tech-
nology behind thousands of free public-domain books. You can import these to 
the iPad without shopping in the iBooks Store. Such titles must be DRM-free, 
which means that they’re free of digital rights management restrictions.
To import ePub titles, you can download them to your Mac or PC, and then 
sync them to the iPad mini through iTunes. There are other methods. If you 
have Dropbox, for example, you can bring an ePub into your account, and 
from Dropbox you can share the title with iBooks. You can also email an ePub 
as an attachment.
You can find ePub titles at numerous cyberspace destinations, among them
	
✓	Baen: www.baen.com
	
✓	Feedbooks: www.feedbooks.com
	
✓	Google Play: http://play.google.com/store/books
	
✓	Project Gutenberg: www.gutenberg.org
	
✓	Smashwords: www.smashwords.com
(Note that not all the books at Google Play are free, and Google has a down-
loadable app.) Also, check out the free titles that you can find through the 
apps mentioned in the preceding section.
Reading Newspapers and Magazines
People in the newspaper business know that it’s been tough sledding in 
recent years. The Internet has proved to be a disruptive force in media, as it 
has in so many areas. It remains to be seen what role Apple generally, and the 
iPad specifically, will play in the future of electronic periodicals or in helping 
to turn around sagging media enterprises. It’s also uncertain which pricing 
models will make the most sense from a business perspective.

205
 Chapter 10: Curling Up with a Good iBook
What we can tell you is that reading newspapers and magazines on the iPad 
mini is not like reading newspapers and magazines in any other electronic 
form. The experience is slick, but only you can decide whether it’s worth 
paying the tab (in the cases where you do have to pay).
You might follow two paths to subscribe to or read a single issue of a news-
paper or magazine. The first path includes several fine publishing apps 
worth checking out, including USA TODAY (where Ed works), The Wall Street 
Journal, TIME magazine, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Reuters News 
Pro, BBC News, Vanity Fair, and Popular Science. We also highly recommend 
fetching the free Zinio app, which offers more than 5,000 digital publications, 
including Rolling Stone, The Economist, Consumer Reports, Forbes, Macworld, 
Car and Driver, Maxim, National Geographic Interactive, Spin, and Bloomberg 
Businessweek. You can buy single issues of a magazine or subscribe, and you 
can sample and share some articles without a subscription.
In some cases, you have to pay handsomely or subscribe to some of these 
newspapers and magazines, which you find not in the iBooks Store but in the 
regular App Store, which we cover in Chapter 11. You also see ads (some-
body has to pay the freight).
The second path is Newsstand. This handy icon on your Home screen pur-
ports to gather all your newspaper and magazine subscriptions in a single 
place. Newsstand is a special type of folder rather than an app.
You purchase subscriptions in a section of the App Store, which you can also 
get to by tapping Newsstand on your Home screen and then tapping the Store 
button, which opens the App Store (see Chapter 11) to the Subscriptions 
section.
Numerous publications have adopted the Newsstand paradigm, though some 
choose custom apps or Zinio, and many do both.

O
 
ne of the best things about the iPad mini is that you can download and 
install apps created by third parties, which is to say not created by 
Apple (the first party) or you (the second party). At the time of this writing, 
our best guess is that there are more than 1.2 million apps available and over 
75 billion apps downloaded to date. Some apps are free, and other apps cost 
money; some apps are useful, and other apps are lame; some apps 
are perfectly well behaved, and other apps quit unexpectedly 
(or worse). The point is that of the many apps out there, 
some are better than others.
In this chapter, we take a broad look at apps that you 
can use with your iPad mini. You discover how to 
find apps on your computer or your iPad, and you 
find some basics for managing your apps. Don’t 
worry: We have plenty to say about specific third-
party apps in Chapters 18 and 19.
Tapping the Magic of Apps
Apps enable you to use your iPad mini as a game console, 
a streaming Netflix player, a recipe finder, a sketchbook, and 
much, much more. You can run three categories of apps on your iPad:
	
✓	Apps made exclusively for the iPad: This is the rarest kind, so you find 
fewer of these than the other two types. These apps won’t run on an 
iPhone or iPod touch, so you can’t even install them on either device.

210
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
✓	Apps made to work properly on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch: These 
so-called universal apps can run on any of the three device types at full 
resolution. What is the full-screen resolution for each device? Glad you 
asked. It ranges from 960 x 640 pixels for older iPhones and iPod touches 
to a whopping 2048 x 1536 pixels on all currently available iPads but the 
first-generation iPad mini (which has but 1024 x 768 pixels).
	
✓	Apps made for the iPhone and iPod touch: These apps run on your 
iPad but only at iPhone/iPod touch resolution (960 x 640) rather than 
the full resolution of your iPad mini (1024 x 768 or 2048 x 1536).
	
	You can double the size of an iPhone/iPod touch app by tapping the 
little 2x button in the lower-right corner of the screen; to return it to its 
native size, tap the 1x button. Figure 11-1 shows you what an iPhone/
iPod touch app looks like on an iPad screen.
Figure 11-1: iPhone/iPod touch apps run at a smaller size (left), but can be increased to double  
size (right).
	
	Frankly, most iPhone/iPod apps look pretty good at 2x size, but we’ve 
seen a few that have jagged graphics and don’t look as nice. Still, with 
1.2 million (or more) apps to choose from, we’re sure that you can find a 
few that make you happy.

211
 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
You can obtain and install apps for your iPad mini in three ways:
	
✓	On your computer
	
✓	On your iPad mini
	
✓	By automatic download
To switch on automatic downloads on the iPad mini, tap Settings➪iTunes & 
App Store. Then tap the Automatic Downloads switch for Apps so that it turns 
green (on). After you do so, all apps you buy with iTunes on your computer 
or buy on other iOS devices will automagically appear on your iPad mini.
	
Consider also enabling automatic downloads for Music, Books, and Updates 
while you have iTunes & App Store settings on your screen.
To use the App Store on your iPad, it must be connected to the Internet. 
Also, if you obtain an app on your computer, it isn’t available on your iPad 
until you either sync the iPad with your computer or download the app from 
iCloud from the Purchased tab, covered later in this chapter. See Chapter 3 
for details about syncing.
	
After you’ve obtained an app from the App Store on your computer or iPad, 
you can download it from iCloud to up to ten iOS devices.
But before you can use the App Store on your iPad or your computer, you 
first need an iTunes Store account. If you don’t already have one, we suggest 
that you launch iTunes on your computer or the App Store or iTunes Store 
app on your iPad. Here’s how:
	
✓	On your computer: Launch iTunes, click Sign In near the upper-left 
corner of the iTunes window, click Create Apple ID, and follow the on-
screen instructions.
	
✓	On your iPad mini: Tap Settings➪iTunes & App Store➪Sign In➪Create 
New Account and follow the on-screen instructions.
	
If you don’t have an iTunes Store account, you can’t download a single cool 
app — not even the free ones — for your iPad mini. ’Nuff said.
Using Your Computer to Find Apps
Okay, start by finding cool iPad apps using iTunes on your computer. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Launch iTunes.
	
2.	Click the iTunes Store tab near the top-center of the iTunes window.

212
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
	
3.	Click the Apps icon (shown in the margin) near the top-left of the 
iTunes window.
	
	 You’re looking at the landing page of the iTunes App Store.
	
4.	Click the iPad tab near the top-center of the iTunes window.
	
	 The iPad section of the iTunes App Store appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
	
	 The default is to display all categories, which is what you see on the 
landing page. To look at a specific category of the App Store, press and 
hold All Categories (near the top-right) and select a category from the 
drop-down menu.
	
	 Now you’re ready to browse, search, and download apps, as we explain 
in the following sections.
Browsing the App Store from your computer
After you have the iTunes App Store on your screen, you have a couple of 
options for exploring its virtual aisles. Allow us to introduce you to the vari-
ous “departments” available from the main screen. The main departments 
are featured in the middle of the screen, and ancillary departments appear on 
either side of them. We start with the ones in the middle:
	
✓	Best New Apps: This department displays six icons (and part of a sev-
enth) in Figure 11-2. These apps are — what else? — the best new apps 
according to Apple’s curators.
	
	Only six and a half icons are visible, but the Best New Apps department 
has more than that. Find the See All link way over to the right of the 
words Best New Apps. Click that link to see all apps in this department at 
once. Or click and drag the scroll bar below the icons to see more.
	
✓	Best New Games: This department displays six and a half icons as well, 
representing the best new games available today. Again, you can see more 
of these icons by clicking the See All link or by dragging the scroll bar.
	
	The Best New Apps and Games sections have appeared near the top of the 
iTunes App store for as long as we can remember. The other departments, 
such as Introducing Bundles and Halloween Apps & Games in Figure 11-2, 
are rotated regularly. In earlier editions of this book, the screen has dis-
played Previous Editors’ Choices and What’s Hot. Regardless of what the 
department is called or its contents, all departments work the same: To 
see more items, click See All or drag the scroll bar.
	
Apple has a habit of redecorating (or even reconfiguring) the iTunes Store 
every so often, so allow us to apologize in advance if things aren’t exactly as 
described here when you visit.

Separating the Best New Apps and Best New Games departments from the 
Introducing Bundles and Halloween Apps & Games departments are two rows 
of advertisements (Fragment, City of Hope, Introducing Bundles, Gorgeous 
Games for iOS 8, and the like in Figure 11-2). Click an ad to learn more.
Two additional departments appear on the right side of the window: Top Paid 
Apps and one of our favorites, Top Free Apps. The number-one app in each 
department displays both its icon and its name; the next nine apps show text 
links only.
Using the search field in the iTunes Store
Browsing the screen is helpful, but if you know exactly what you’re looking 
for, searching is faster. Follow these steps to search for an app:
	
1.	In the search field in the upper-right corner of the main iTunes window, 
type a word or phrase. Press Return or Enter to initiate the search.
	
	 In Figure 11-3, we searched for photo. You see results for the entire 
iTunes Store, which includes music, television shows, movies, and other 
stuff in addition to iPad apps.
Figure 11-3: We want to do cool stuff with our iPad camera, so we  
searched for photo.
	
2.	Click iPad Apps (as shown in Figure 11-3) to limit your results to only 
iPad apps.
One last thing: The little triangle to the right of each item’s price (or free, 
download, or downloaded) button is another drop-down menu, as shown for 
the Adobe Photoshop Express app in Figure 11-3. This drop-down menu lets 
you give this app to someone as a gift, add it to your wish list, send a link to

 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
it in an email to a friend (shown selected in Figure 11-3), share this item on 
Facebook or Twitter, or copy the product’s link to the Clipboard so that you 
can paste it elsewhere.
Getting more information about  
an app in the iTunes Store
Now that you know how 
to find apps in the App 
Store, this section delves 
a little deeper and shows 
you how to find out more 
about an app that inter-
ests you.
To find out more about an 
app, just click its icon or 
text link. A details screen 
like the one shown in 
Figure 11-4 appears.
This screen tells you most 
of what you need to know 
about the app, such as 
basic product information 
and a narrative descrip-
tion, what’s new in this 
version, the language 
it’s presented in, and its 
system requirements. In 
the following sections, 
you take a closer look at 
the various areas on the 
screen.
Finding the full app description
	
Note the blue More link in the lower-right corner of the Description section in 
Figure 11-4; click More to see a longer description of the app.
Bear in mind that the app description on this screen was written by the app’s 
developer and may be somewhat biased. Never fear, gentle reader: In an 
upcoming section, we show you how to find app reviews written by people 
who have used it (and, unfortunately, sometimes people who haven’t).

iPad, a nifty drawing and painting app for your iPad.

Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
Understanding the app rating
The SketchBook Express app is rated 4+, as you can see below the Free 
button in the upper-left corner of the screen shown in Figure 11-4. The rating 
means that the app contains no objectionable material. Here are the other 
possible ratings:
	
✓	9+: May contain mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy, or 
realistic violence; or infrequent or mild mature, suggestive, or horror-
themed content that may not be suitable for children younger than the 
age of 9.
	
✓	12+: May contain infrequent mildly offensive language; frequent or 
intense cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence; mild or infrequent mature 
or suggestive themes; or simulated gambling that may not be suitable 
for children younger than the age of 12.
	
✓	17+: May contain frequent and intense offensive language; frequent and 
intense cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence; mature, frequent, and 
intense mature, suggestive, or horror-themed content; sexual content; 
nudity; or depictions of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs that may not be suit-
able for children younger than the age of 17. You must be at least 17 
years old to purchase games with this rating.
Checking requirements and device support for the app
Last but not least, remember the three categories of apps we mention at the 
beginning of the chapter, in the “Tapping the Magic of Apps” section? If you 
look below the Information heading in Figure 11-4 (below the Description and 
What’s New sections), you can see the requirements for this particular app. 
It says Requires iOS 6 or later. Compatible with iPad. Note that it doesn’t men-
tion the iPhone or iPod touch. That’s because this app is in the first category 
of apps, those made exclusively for the iPad. Another clue that it falls into the 
first category is that it says iPad Screenshots above the two pictures shown in 
Figure 11-4. Finally, the app’s name — SketchBook Express for iPad — should 
be a dead giveaway.
	
If the app belonged to the second or third category — apps made to work 
properly on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, or apps made for the iPhone or 
iPod touch — the Information section would read Compatible with iPhone, 
iPod touch, and iPad rather than Compatible with iPad.
Now you’re probably wondering how you can tell whether an app falls into 
the second or third category. The first clue is the little gray + sign next to the 
price, which appears for many of the apps shown in Figure 11-3. Apps with 
this symbol are universal and run at full resolution on iPhones and iPads. 
Another clue is to look at the screen shots. If you see two tabs — iPhone and 
iPad — after Screenshots, the app will work at the full resolution of an iPad, 
iPhone, or iPod touch. Conversely, if you only see one tab that says iPhone 
Screenshots, the app will run at iPhone/iPod touch resolution on your iPad.

217
 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
	
One way to ensure that you look only for apps that take advantage of your iPad’s 
big screen is to click the iPad tab on the front page of the App Store (shown ear-
lier in Figure 11-2). All the apps displayed under the iPad tab are of the first or 
second type and are designed to take advantage of your iPad’s larger screen.
Reading reviews
If you tap Ratings and Reviews below the product’s name near the top of the 
screen, you’ll see reviews written by users of this app. Each review includes a 
star rating, from zero to five. If an app is rated four stars or higher, you’re safe 
to assume that most users are happy with this app.
In Figure 11-4, you can see that this app has an average rating for the current 
version of 4.5 stars based on 107 user ratings. You can tap Ratings and Reviews 
to see the average rating for all versions (4 stars based on 2,129 user ratings for 
SketchBook Express). That means it’s probably a pretty good app.
Finally, at the top of the Customer Reviews section and near the right side is 
a pop-up menu displaying Most Helpful (not shown in Figure 11-4). This menu 
lets you sort the customer reviews by your choice of Most Helpful, Most 
Favorable, Most Critical, or Most Recent.
	
Don’t believe everything you read in reviews. Some people buy an app with-
out reading its description, or they try to use it without following the included 
instructions. Then, when the app doesn’t do what they expected, they give it 
a low rating. The point is, take the ratings and reviews with a grain of salt.
Downloading an app from the iTunes Store
When you find an app you 
want to try while brows-
ing the App Store on your 
computer, just click the 
app’s Free or Buy button. 
When you do so, you have 
to log in to your iTunes 
Store account, even if the 
app is free.
After you log in, the app 
begins downloading. When 
it’s finished, it appears in 
the Apps section of your 
iTunes library, as shown in 
Figure 11-5.
If an app costs money, 
you’ll get a receipt for it via e-mail, usually within 24 hours.
Figure 11-5: Apps that you download appear in the Apps 
section of your iTunes library.

218
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
Downloading an app to your iTunes library is only the first half of getting it 
onto your iPad mini. After you download an app, you can sync your iPad so 
the app will be available on it. Chapter 3 covers syncing in detail. You can 
also get the app via the App Store’s Purchased tab (described later in this 
chapter) or by enabling Automatic Downloads on the Settings app’s Store 
pane on your iPad or the iTunes Preferences Store tab on your computer.
If you want apps to download to your iPad mini automatically, regardless of 
which device you used to purchase the app, you can set that up:
	
✓	On a computer: Connect your iPad mini via either USB cable or Wi-Fi. 
Launch iTunes and click the iPad button near the upper-right corner of 
the iTunes window. Click the Apps tab, scroll to the bottom, and enable 
the Automatically Sync New Apps check box.
	
✓	On your iPad mini: Tap Settings➪iTunes and App Store. Then turn on 
the switch for Apps in the Automatic Downloads section.
	
You can enable Automatic Downloads for Music and Books on your iPad (but 
not in iTunes).
Updating an app from the iTunes Store
Every so often, the developer of an iPad app releases an update. Sometimes 
these updates add new features to the app, sometimes they squash bugs, and 
sometimes they do both. In any event, updates are usually good things for 
you and your iPad mini, so it makes sense to check for them every so often.
To do this in iTunes: Click the Apps icon to select it, as shown in Figure 11-5. 
Click the Updates tab. Then, to update all the apps at once, click the Update 
All Apps button in the lower-right corner of the screen. To update apps one 
by one, click the individual Update button for each app you want to update.
Note that if you hover the pointer over the Apps icon when updates are avail-
able, you’ll see how many updates are waiting for you.
After you download an update this way, it replaces the older version in your 
iTunes library and on your iPad automatically the next time you sync. Or, 
if you’ve enabled automatic downloads for apps as described earlier in the 
chapter, the new app replaces the old app automatically the next time you’re 
connected to the Internet.
Using Your iPad mini to Find Apps
Finding apps with your iPad mini is almost as easy as finding them by using 
iTunes. The only requirement is that you have an Internet connection of 
some sort — Wi-Fi or wireless data network — so that you can access the 
iTunes App Store and browse, search, download, and install apps.

219
 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
Browsing the App Store on your iPad mini
	
	 To get started, tap the 
App Store icon (shown 
in the margin) on your 
iPad mini’s Home screen. 
After you launch the App 
Store, you see five icons 
at the bottom of the 
screen, representing five 
ways to interact with 
the store, as shown in 
Figure 11-6. The first four 
icons at the bottom of 
the screen — Featured, 
Top Charts, Explore, and 
Purchased — offer four 
ways to browse the vir-
tual shelves of the App 
Store. (We cover the fifth 
icon, Updates, a little 
later, in the “Updating an app from the App Store” section.)
Tap Categories in the top-left corner to browse apps in categories such as 
Books, Education, Games, Music, News, and Productivity, to name a few. Tap 
a category to see the apps it contains.
The Featured section is almost the same as the section of the same name on 
the landing page of the iTunes App Store (refer to Figure 11-2). Scroll down 
and you’ll find the same ads and departments you’d see in iTunes on your 
computer.
The Top Charts section offers lists of the top paid and free apps, which corre-
late with the Top Free and Top Paid lists, respectively, on the right side of the 
screen in iTunes (as shown in Figure 11-2).
	
The Explore section is new in iOS 8 and kind of cool. After granting it permis-
sion to use your current location, you’ll find apps with local content, such as 
newspaper, television, and public transit apps. The feature is handy in your 
hometown but even more useful when you’re out of town. (Note that Location 
Services must be enabled in Settings➪Privacy for this feature to work.)
Finally, the Purchased section displays all your iPad apps — the ones cur-
rently installed on this iPad mini and any that you’ve purchased that aren’t 
installed. To the right of each app, you see either Installed or iCloud. To 
install an uninstalled app, tap its iCloud button and then type your password.
Figure 11-6: The icons across the bottom represent the five 
sections of the App Store.

220
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
Most pages in the App Store display more apps than can fit on the screen at 
once. For example, the Best New Apps section in Figure 11-6 contains more 
than the nine apps you can see. A few tools help you navigate the multiple 
pages of apps:
	
✓	Swipe from right to left to see more apps in a category.
	
✓	Swipe up the screen to see additional categories.
	
✓	Tap the See All link at the top-right of most sections to (what else?) see 
all the apps in that section on the same screen.
Using the search field in the App Store
If you know exactly what you’re looking for (or even approximately what 
you’re looking for), rather than simply browsing, you can tap the search field 
in the upper-right corner of the iPad screen and type a word or phrase; then 
tap the Search key on the keyboard to initiate the search.
Finding details about an app in the App Store
Now that you know how 
to find apps in the App 
Store, the following sec-
tions show you how to 
find out more about a 
particular app. After tap-
ping an app icon as you 
browse the store or in a 
search result, your iPad 
displays a details screen 
like the one shown in 
Figure 11-7.
	
The app description on 
this screen was written 
by the developer and may 
be somewhat biased.
The information you 
find on the Details tab 
for an app on your iPad 
is similar to that info on 
the iTunes screen on 
your computer. The links, 
rating, and requirements simply appear in slightly different places on your iPad 
screen. (See the section “Getting more information about an app in the iTunes 
Store,” earlier in this chapter, for explanations of the main on-screen items.)

awesome graphics and realistic physics.

 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
To read reviews from your iPad, tap the Reviews tab. If you scroll to the bottom 
of the page and see a More Reviews button (not visible in Figure 11-7), tap it to 
see (what else?) more reviews.
Downloading an app from the App Store
To download an app to your iPad mini (while using your iPad mini), follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Tap the blue price button (or the word Free or the download from 
iCloud icon) near the top of the app’s details screen.
	
	 In Figure 11-7, you see the download from iCloud icon instead of a price 
because we purchased the game previously. Once tapped, the button 
transforms into a green Buy button.
	
2.	Tap the Buy button.
	
3.	When prompted, type your iTunes Store account password.
	
	
	 After you do, the App Store closes, and you see the Home screen where 
the new app’s icon will reside. The new app’s icon is slightly dimmed and 
has the word Loading beneath it, with a blue progress bar to indicate 
how much of the app remains to be downloaded, as shown in the margin.
	
4.	If the app is rated 17+, click OK on the warning screen that appears 
after you type your password to confirm that you’re 17 or older 
before the app downloads.
The app is now on your iPad mini, but it isn’t copied to your iTunes library 
on your Mac or PC until your next sync unless you’ve enabled automatic 
Downloading other content on your iPad mini
You may have noticed that the App Store app 
on your iPad offers nothing but apps. iTunes 
on your computer, on the other hand, includes 
sections for music, movies, TV shows, books, 
podcasts, and iTunes U.
On your iPad mini, you obtain music, movies, and 
TV shows with the iTunes Store app, magazines 
with the Newsstand app, books with the iBooks 
app, and podcasts with the Podcasts app. All 
these apps come with your iPad. For iTunes U 
content, however, you’ll need the iTunes U app, 
which (curiously) is not included with your iPad 
mini out of the box.
The good news is that all these apps are free in 
the App Store, so if you want to shop for books, 
podcasts, or iTunes U content on your iPad and 
you don’t already have the apps on your iPad 
mini, you should download them now.
All these apps work pretty much the same, so 
when you understand how to navigate the App 
Store app, you also know how to use all the 
store apps.

222
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
downloads. If your iPad suddenly loses its memory (unlikely) or if you delete 
the app from your iPad before you sync (as we describe later in this chapter, in 
the section “Deleting an app”), that app is gone. That’s the bad news. The good 
news is that you can download it again from the Purchased tab as described 
earlier in the chapter. Or the app will reappear spontaneously on your iPad if 
you’ve enabled automatic downloads.
Updating an app from the App Store
As we mention earlier in this chapter, every so often the developer of an iPad 
app releases an update. If an update awaits you, a little number in a circle 
appears on the Updates icon at the bottom of the iPad screen. Follow these 
steps to update your apps from your iPad:
	
1.	Tap the Updates icon if any of your apps needs updating.
	
	 If you tap the Updates icon and see (in the middle of the screen) a mes-
sage that says All Apps Are Up to Date, none of the apps on your 
iPad requires an update at this time. If apps need updating, they appear 
with Update buttons next to them.
	
2.	Tap the Update button that appears next to any app to update it.
	
	 If more than one app needs updating, you can update them all at once 
by tapping the Update All button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
If you try to update an app purchased from any iTunes Store account except 
your own, you’re prompted for that account’s ID and password. If you can’t 
provide them, you can’t download the update.
Working with Apps
Most of what you need to know about apps involves simply installing third-
party apps on your iPad. However, you might find it helpful to know how to 
delete and review an app.
Deleting an app
The preinstalled apps that came on your iPad mini can’t be removed, but 
you have two ways to delete any other app: in iTunes on your computer or 
directly from your iPad.
	
You can, however, hide certain preinstalled apps by choosing Settings➪ 
General➪Restrictions.
To delete an app in iTunes (that is, from your computer), click the Apps icon 
and then do one of the following:

223
 Chapter 11: App-solutely!
	
✓	Click the app to select it and press the delete or backspace key on the 
keyboard.
	
✓	Click the app to select it and then choose Edit➪Delete.
	
✓	Right-click the app and choose Delete.
After taking any of the actions in this list, you see a dialog that asks whether 
you’re sure that you want to remove the selected app. If you click the Remove 
button, the app is removed from your iTunes library as well as from any iPad 
that syncs with your iTunes library.
Here’s how to delete an app on your iPad mini:
	
1.	Press and hold any icon until all the icons begin to wiggle.
	
2.	Tap the little x in the upper-left corner of 
the app that you want to delete.
	
	 A dialog appears, informing you that delet-
ing this app also deletes all its data, as 
shown in Figure 11-8.
	
3.	Tap the Delete button.
	
	 You can’t delete any of the bundled apps 
that came with your iPad.
	
4.	To stop the icons from wiggling, press the 
Home or sleep/wake button.
	
You also make icons wiggle to move them around 
on the screen or move them from page to page. 
To rearrange wiggling icons, press and drag them one at a time. If you drag an 
icon to the left or right edge of the screen, it moves to the next or previous 
Home screen. You can also drag two additional icons to the dock (where 
Safari, Mail, Photos, and Music live) and have a total of six apps available 
from every Home screen.
Friendly reminder: Rearranging your icons in iTunes is faster and easier than 
making them wiggle and move on the iPad. See Chapter 3 to find out how.
Writing an app review
Sometimes you love or hate an app so much that you want to tell the world 
about it. In that case, you should write a review. You can do this in two ways: 
in iTunes on your computer or directly from your iPad mini.
To write a review using iTunes on your computer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Navigate to the details page for the app in the iTunes App Store.
Figure 11-8: Tap an app’s little x 
and then tap Delete to remove 
the app from your iPad.

224
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
2.	Click the Ratings and Reviews tab and then click the Write a Review 
button.
	
	 You may or may not have to type your iTunes Store password.
	
3.	Click the button for the star rating (1 to 5) you want to give the app.
	
4.	In the Title field, type a title for your review, and in the Review field, 
type your review.
	
5.	Click the Submit button when you’re finished.
	
	 The Preview screen appears. If the review looks good to you, you’re 
done. If you want to change something, click the Edit button.
To write a review from your iPad mini, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Tap the App Store icon to launch the App Store.
	
2.	Navigate to the details screen for the app.
	
3.	Scroll down the page and tap the Write a Review link.
	
	 You probably have to type your iTunes Store password.
	
4.	Tap one to five of the stars at the top of the Write a Review screen to 
rate the app.
	
5.	In the Title field, type a title for your review, and in the Review field, 
type your review.
	
6.	Tap the Submit button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Whichever way you submit your review, Apple reviews your submission. As 
long as the review doesn’t violate the (unpublished) rules of conduct for app 
reviews, it appears in a day or two in the App Store, in the Reviews section 
for the particular app.

▶	Mingling with contacts
W
 
e hate to break the news to you, but your iPad mini isn’t all fun and 
games; it has a serious side. The iPad can remind you of appoint-
ments and help you keep all your contacts straight. If you purchased a new 
iPad (or iPhone or iPod touch) after October 22, 2013, you also received the 
iWork suite, which includes Numbers (a first-class spreadsheet), Pages (a ter-
rific word processor), and Keynote (the best presentation program we know), 
as well as the iLife suite (iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand).
In this chapter, we explore Calendar and Contacts, a pair of apps that aren’t 
particularly flashy but can be remarkably useful. Space constraints 
prohibit us from covering iWork and iLife in this book, but 
check out our online coverage.
Working with the Calendar
The Calendar program lets you keep on top of your 
appointments and events (birthdays, anniversaries, 
and the like). You open it by tapping the Calendar 
icon on the Home screen. The icon is smart in its 
own right because it changes daily, displaying the 
day of the week and the date.
You can display five calendar views: by year, by month, 
by day, by week, and by a searchable list view that shows 
current and future appointments.
Tap one of the four tabs at the top of the screen — Day, Week, Month, or 
Year — to choose a view. There’s a Today button in the lower-left corner of 
the screen, which returns you to the current date in any view. (Also at the 
bottom of the screen are the Calendars button and Inbox button, which we 
get to shortly.)

226
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
To get to list view, tap the search icon — a little magnifying glass — in the 
upper-right corner of the screen.
We take a closer look at these views in the following sections.
Year view
There’s not much to the yearly view, but it does let you see the current calen-
dar year with today’s date circled in red. You can scroll up or down to see prior 
or future years, but that’s about it; unfortunately, you still can’t tell on which 
days you have appointments in year view. Boo. Hiss.
Month view
Tap any of the months visible in the 
yearly view to jump to that specific 
month, as shown in Figure 12-1. 
When your iPad mini is in month 
view, you can see which days have 
appointments or scheduled events. 
Tap a day to see the list of activities 
on the agenda for that day, which 
leads nicely into the next section.
Day view
As we just mentioned, you have to 
tap a date to see what you have going 
on in a 24-hour period — though to 
see an entire day’s worth of entries, 
you’ll have to scroll up or down. You 
can swipe to the left to advance to 
the next day of the week and beyond; 
swipe to the right to retreat one or 
more days; or tap a day near the top 
of the screen to jump to it.
In this day view, all-day events, birthdays, and events pulled from your 
Facebook account (if you provide your Facebook credentials) appear in a 
narrow strip above the timeline for the day, as shown for Florence, Italy, in 
Figure 12-2.
Your daily appointments span the entire time in which they’ve been sched-
uled on your calendar. For example, if an appointment runs from 11:00 a.m. to 
1:00 p.m., those two hours will be blocked off on the calendar.
Figure 12-1: Month view.

227
 Chapter 12: People, Places, and Appointments
You find out how to create calendar 
entries in a moment, but for now 
know that you can hold down on an 
event and drag it to a new time slot 
should your plans change. If you 
have overlapping appointments, 
you’ll see more than a single entry 
claim a given time slot.
Calendars are color-coded accord-
ing to the calendar in which you 
scheduled the appointment to help 
you distinguish an appointment you 
made on your travel calendar versus, 
say, a work, family, or Facebook 
calendar.
Week view
In week view, shown in Figure 12-3, 
you can see an entire week at a 
glance. The current day is circled 
in red. You can arrange to start 
your weekly view on any day of the week. Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars➪Start Week On, and then tap the day on which you want to start 
your week. (Sunday is the default in the United States.)
Figure 12-2: Day view.
Syncing calendars with your desktop
The iPad mini can display the color-coding you 
assigned in Calendar (formerly iCal) in Mountain 
Lion or later on a Mac. Cool, huh?
If you’re a Mac user who uses Calendar, you can 
create multiple calendars and choose which 
ones to sync with your iPad. What’s more, you 
can choose to display any or all of your calen-
dars. Calendar entries you create on your iPad 
are synchronized with the calendar(s) you speci-
fied in the iTunes Info pane. You can also sync 
calendars with Microsoft Outlook on a Mac or 
Microsoft Outlook on a PC.
The best solution we’ve found is to use iCloud 
to keep calendars updated and in sync across 
all your iOS devices and computers. On the 
iPad, tap Settings➪iCloud and make sure the 
Calendars switch is turned on (green).
One last thing: If you’re a Mac user running 
OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later, iCloud is the 
only way you can sync data, as we mention 
in Chapter 3.

List view
List view isn’t complicated. You 
can get to this view by tapping the 
search (magnifying glass) icon in the 
upper-right corner of the screen. As 
you would expect, all your calendar 
appointments are listed chronologi-
cally, as shown in Figure 12-4. If you 
have a lengthy list, drag up or down 
or flick to rapidly scroll through your 
appointments. If you’re looking for 
a specific calendar entry, you can 
search for appointments by typing 
the title, invitee names, location, or 
note in the search box above your 
list of entries (or employ Spotlight to 
help you search).
Tap any of the listings to get meeting 
or appointment details for that entry. 
If you tap a person’s birthday, you 
see his or her contact information. 
Sorry, but you just ran out of excuses 
for not sending a card at least.
Adding Calendar Entries
In Chapter 3, you discover pretty 
much everything there is to know 
about syncing your iPad mini, 
including syncing calendar entries 
from your Windows machine (using 
the likes of Microsoft Outlook) or 
Mac (using Calendar, Microsoft 
Entourage, or Outlook). You can also 
add calendar entries from iCloud.
In addition, any calendar entries in 
Facebook can automatically show up 
in the Calendar app. You will have to 
visit Settings, enter your username 
and password, and then make sure 
the Calendar app in the Facebook 
setting is turned on.

 Chapter 12: People, Places, and Appointments
In plenty of situations, you enter appointments on the fly. Adding appoint-
ments directly to the iPad is easy:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Calendar icon, and then tap the Year, 
Month, or Day view.
	
2.	Tap the + icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
	 The New Event screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-5.
	
3.	Tap the Title and Location fields in turn 
and type as much or as little information as 
you feel is necessary.
	
	 Tapping displays the virtual keyboard (if it’s 
not already shown).
	
	 You can use dictation or Siri to add a calen-
dar entry. See Chapter 14 for more on dicta-
tion and Siri.
	
4.	To add start and end times:
	
a.	Tap the Starts field.
	
	A carousel wheel, like the one shown 
for the Ends time in Figure 12-6, 
appears below the field you tapped.
	
b.	Choose the time the event starts.
	
	Use your finger to roll separate carousel 
controls for the date, hour, and minute 
(in 1-minute intervals) and to specify 
AM or PM. The process is a little like 
manipulating a combination bicycle 
lock or an old-fashioned date stamp 
used with an inkpad.
	
c.	Tap the Ends field and choose the time the event ends.
	
	 To enter an all-day milestone (such as a birthday), tap the All-Day 
switch to turn it on. (Green will be showing.) Because the time is no 
longer relevant for an all-day entry, you won’t see Starts, Ends, or 
Time Zone options.
	
5.	When you’re finished, tap Add.
	
Because all iPad minis are equipped with Siri, we can’t think of any easier way 
to add an entry. You can instruct Siri along the lines of “Set a lunch appoint-
ment for tomorrow at noon with the Smiths.” Siri is pleased to comply.
Figure 12-5: The screen looks 
like this just before you add an 
event to your iPad mini.

230
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
That’s the minimum you have to do to set up 
an event. But we bet you want to do more. The 
Calendar app makes it easy:
	
✓	Change the time zone. If the correct loca-
tion isn’t already present, tap the Time Zone 
field and type the name of the city where the 
appointment is taking place.
	
✓	Set up a recurring entry. Tap the Repeat 
field. Tap to indicate how often the event 
in question recurs. This setting is good for 
everything from a weekly appointment, such 
as an allergy shot, to a yearly event, such as 
an anniversary.
	
	The options are Every Day, Every Week, 
Every 2 Weeks, Every Month, and Every 
Year. Tap Never if you are planning to never 
repeat this entry again.
	
✓	Add travel time to and from events. Tap the 
Travel Time field and enable the Travel Time 
switch. A list of durations appears, ranging 
from five minutes to two hours. Tap a dura-
tion to specify your travel time.
	
✓	Assign the entry to a particular calendar. 
Tap Calendar, and then tap the calendar you 
have in mind (Home or Work, for example).
	
✓	Invite people to join you. Tap Invitees to specify who among your con-
tacts will be attending the event.
	
✓	Set a reminder or alert for the entry. Tap Alert and tap a time.
	
	Alerts can be set to arrive at the actual time of an event, or 1 week before, 
2 days before, 1 day before, 2 hours before, 1 hour before, 30 minutes 
before, 15 minutes before, or 5 minutes before the event. If it’s an all-day 
entry, you can request alerts 1 day before (at 9:00 a.m.), 2 days before (at 
9:00 a.m.), or 1 week before.
	
	When the appointment time rolls around, you hear a sound and see a 
message like the one shown in Figure 12-7.
	
✓	If you’re the kind of person who needs an 
extra nudge, set another reminder by tap-
ping the Second Alert field (which you’ll see 
only if a first alert is already set).
	
✓	Indicate whether you’re busy or free by 
tapping Show As. If you’re invited to an 
event, you can tap Availability and then tap 
Free (if it’s shown on your iPad).
Figure 12-6: Controlling the 
Starts and Ends fields is like 
manipulating a bike lock.

to forget.

 Chapter 12: People, Places, and Appointments
	
✓	Enter a web address. Tap the URL field (at the bottom of the New Event 
screen) and type the web address.
	
✓	Enter notes about the appointment or event. Tap the Notes field (at the 
bottom of the screen) and type your note.
Tap Done after you finish entering everything.
Managing your calendars
When you have the hang of creating calendar entries, you can make the task 
much easier with these tips:
	
✓	Choose a default calendar. Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, 
and then flick the screen until the Calendar section appears. Tap Default 
Calendar and select the calendar that you want to show up regularly.
	
✓	Make events appear according to whichever time zone you selected 
for your calendars. In the Calendar settings, tap Time Zone Support to 
turn it on, and then tap Time Zone. Type the time zone’s location, using 
the keyboard that appears. If you travel long distances for your job, this 
setting comes in handy.
	
	When Time Zone Support is turned off, events are displayed according 
to the time zone of your current location.
	
✓	Turn off a calendar alert. Tap Settings➪Sounds, and then make sure 
that the selected alert tone is set to None. (You see only the last calendar 
alert sound that you selected. To see your other choices, tap Calendar 
Alerts.) You can also set default alert times for birthdays, all-day events, 
or certain other events. Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and 
scroll down to Default Alert Times. For birthdays or all-day events, you 
can choose to be alerted at 9:00 a.m. on the day of the event, at 9:00 a.m. 
one day before, at 9:00 a.m. two days before, or a week before. For other 
alerts, you can choose a default alert time at the time of event, 5 minutes 
before, 15 minutes before, 30 minutes before, 1 hour before, 2 hours 
before, 1 day before, 2 days before, or 1 week before the event.
	
✓	Modify an existing calendar entry. Tap the entry, tap Edit, and then 
make whichever changes need to be made.
	
✓	Wipe out a calendar entry. Tap Edit➪Delete Event. You have a chance 
to confirm your choice by tapping either Delete Event (again) or Cancel.
Letting your calendar push you around
If you work for a company that uses Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, calendar 
entries and meeting invitations from coworkers can be pushed to your device 
so that they show up on the screen moments after they’re entered, even if 
they’re entered on computers at work. Setting up an account to facilitate 
this pushing of calendar entries to your iPad mini is a breeze, although you 

232
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
should check with your company’s tech or IT department to make sure that 
your employer allows it. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪Add Account.
	
2.	From the Add Account list, tap Microsoft Exchange.
	
3.	Fill in the email address, username, password, and description fields, 
and then tap Next.
	
4.	If required, enter your server address on the next screen that appears.
	
	 The iPad supports something called the Microsoft Autodiscovery service, 
which uses your name and password to automatically determine the 
address of the Exchange server. The rest of the fields should be filled in with 
the email address, username, password, and description you just entered.
	
5.	Tap Next.
	
6.	Tap the switch to turn on each information type that you want to syn-
chronize using Microsoft Exchange.
	
	 The options are Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Reminders. You should 
be good to go now, although some employers may require you to add 
passcodes to safeguard company secrets.
	
If you have a business-issued iPad and it is lost or stolen — or it turns out 
that you’re a double agent working for a rival company — your employer’s IT 
administrators can remotely wipe your device clean.
Calendar entries can also be pushed as part of iCloud.
Displaying multiple calendars
By tapping the 
Calendars button at the 
bottom of the yearly, 
monthly, or daily view, 
you can choose the 
calendar or calendars 
to display on your iPad. 
Merely tap the calen-
dar that you want to 
include so that a check 
mark appears next to it, 
as shown in Figure 12-8.
You can tap the Hide All 
Calendars button when 
you don’t want any cal-
endars to be visible, or 
Figure 12-8: Choosing the calendars to display.

233
 Chapter 12: People, Places, and Appointments
conversely tap Show All Calendars when you want your entire schedule to be 
an open book. You can also turn on Facebook events (in Settings) to display 
those in your calendar, as well as display birthdays, including those of the 
people you’ve friended on the social network.
From the Calendars listing, tap the i-in-a-circle for even more tricks. You can 
assign a color to your calendar, share the calendar with a given individual 
(tap Add Person to do so), make a calendar public (by flipping a switch), or 
delete the calendar.
Responding to meeting invitations
The iPad mini has one more important button in the Calendar app. It’s the Inbox 
button, located at the bottom-right corner of the yearly, monthly, and daily 
views. If you partake in iCloud, have a Microsoft Exchange account, or have a 
calendar that adheres to the CalDAV Internet standard, you can send and receive 
a meeting invitation, though you also need a compatible email app that under-
stands CalDAV and lets you not only receive but also respond to the invitation.
If you have any pending invitations, you’ll see them when you tap the Inbox, 
which is separated into new invitations and invitations to which you’ve 
already replied. You can tap any of the items in the list to see more details 
about the event to which you’ve been invited.
Suppose that a meeting invitation arrives from your boss. You can see who 
else is attending the shindig, check scheduling conflicts, and more. Tap 
Accept to let the meeting organizer know you’re attending, tap Decline if you 
have something better to do (and aren’t worried about upsetting the person 
who signs your paycheck), or tap Maybe if you’re waiting for a better offer.
And as we point out previously, you can also invite other folks to attend an 
event that you yourself are putting together.
Meantime, if you run into a conflict, why not ask Siri to change your schedule? 
For that matter, you can also call upon Siri to remind you when you have your 
next appointment. Visit Chapter 14 for more on this clever feature.
	
You can choose to receive an alert every time someone sends you an invita-
tion. In the Calendar settings, tap New Invitation Alerts so that the switch is 
turned on.
As mentioned, if you take advantage of iCloud, you can keep calendar entries 
synchronized between your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac or PC. When 
you make a scheduling change on your iPad, it’s automatically updated on 
your computer and other devices, and vice versa. Choose iCloud from the 
Add Account screen to get started, assuming you didn’t turn on iCloud when 
you first activated your iPad.

234
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
Subscribing to calendars
You can subscribe to calendars that adhere to the CalDAV and iCalendar 
(.ics) standards, which are supported by the popular Google and Yahoo! cal-
endars and by the Mac’s Calendar app. Although you can read entries on the 
iPad from the calendars you subscribe to, you can’t create entries from the 
iPad or edit the entries that are already present.
To subscribe to one of these calendars, tap Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars➪ 
Add Account➪Other. You then choose Add CalDAV Account or Add Subscribed 
Calendar. Next, enter the server where the iPad can find the calendar you have 
in mind, and if need be, a username, a password, and an optional description.
Sifting through Contacts
If you read the chapter on syncing (see Chapter 3), you know how to get 
the snail-mail addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers that reside 
on your Mac or PC into the iPad. Assuming that you went through that drill 
already, all those addresses and phone numbers are hanging out in one place. 
Their not-so-secret hiding place is revealed when you tap the Contacts icon 
on the Home screen. The following sections guide you from the main screen 
to whatever you want to do with your contacts’ information.
Adding and viewing 
contacts
To add contacts from the Contacts 
app, tap the + icon at the top of the 
screen and type as much or as little 
profile information as you have for 
the person. Tap Add Photo to add a 
picture from your photo albums or 
collections (or to take a snapshot 
with your iPad mini camera). You 
can edit the information later by tap-
ping the Edit button when a contact’s 
name is highlighted.
A list of your contacts appears on 
the left panel of the screen, with the 
one you’re currently viewing shown 
in gray; see Figure 12-9. On the right, 
you can see a mug shot of your con-
tact, plus any info you have: phone 
Figure 12-9: A view of all contacts.

235
 Chapter 12: People, Places, and Appointments
number, email address, home and another address, and birthday (all blurred in 
Figure 12-9 to protect Jacob’s privacy). You also find an area to scribble notes 
about a contact.
	
You have three ways to land on a specific contact:
	
✓	Flick your finger so that the list of contacts on the left side scrolls rap-
idly up or down, loosely reminiscent of the spinning Lucky 7s and other 
pictures on a Las Vegas slot machine. Think of the payout you’d get with 
that kind of power on a one-armed bandit.
	
✓	Slide your thumb or another finger along the alphabet on the left edge 
of the contacts list or tap one of the teeny-tiny letters to jump to names 
that begin with that letter.
	
✓	Start to type the name of a contact in the search field near the top of 
the contacts list. Or type the name of the place your contact works. 
When you’re at or near the appropriate contact name, stop the scrolling 
by tapping the screen.
	
	When you tap to stop the scrolling, that tap doesn’t select an item in the 
list. This may seem counterintuitive the first few times you try it, but we 
got used to it and now we really like it this way. Just think of that first 
tap as applying the brakes to the scrolling list.
You can change the way your contacts are displayed. Tap Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars. Then scroll down to Contacts settings on the right side 
of the screen, if it’s not already visible. Tap Sort Order or Display Order, and 
for each one, choose the First, Last option or Last, First option to indicate 
whether you want to sort or display entries by a contact’s first or last name.
Searching contacts
You can search contacts by entering a first or last name in the search field or 
by entering a company name.
	
You can locate people on your iPad mini without opening the Contacts app. 
Type a name in the Spotlight search field (see Chapter 2), and then tap the 
name in the search results. And you can not only ask Siri to find people for 
you, but also have her compose and send them an email or iMessage, or call 
them via FaceTime video or audio chat.
If you’re searching contacts with a Microsoft Exchange account, you may be 
able to search your employer’s global address list (GAL for short). This search 
typically works in one of two ways:
	
✓	Tap the Groups button in the upper-left corner of the All Contacts screen 
and then tap the appropriate Exchange server name to find folks. Groups 
on your computer might reflect, say, different departments in your com-
pany, friends from work, friends from school, and so on.

236
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
✓	You can search an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server. It 
strikes us that nothing is “lightweight” about something called an LDAP 
server, but we digress. Similarly, if you have a CardDAV account, you can 
search for any contacts that have been synced to the iPad.
Contacting and sharing your contacts
You can initiate an email from Contacts by tapping an email address under a 
contact’s listings. Doing so fires up the Mail program on the iPad mini, with 
the person’s name already in the To field. For more on the Mail app, we direct 
you to Chapter 5.
You can also share a contact’s profile with another person. Tap the Share 
Contact button (you may have to scroll down to see it), and use the Mail or 
Messages app to send the contact’s vCard, which is embedded in the body 
of a new Mail or Messages message. Just add an address and send it on its 
merry way. A vCard, in case you were wondering, is kind of like an electronic 
business card. You can identify it by its .vcf file format.
Finally, you can tap a contact’s snail-mail address to launch the Maps app and 
see it pinned to a map.
Linking contacts
The people you know most likely have contact entries in more than one 
account, meaning that you might end up with redundant entries for the same 
person. The iPad solution is to link contacts. Find the contact in question, tap 
Edit, scroll to the bottom of the Edit screen, and tap Link Contact. Choose the 
related contact entry and then tap Link. It’s worth noting that the linked con-
tacts in each account remain separate and aren’t merged.
Removing a contact
Hey, it happens. A person falls out of favor. Maybe he’s a jilted lover. Or 
maybe you just moved cross country and no longer will call on the services 
of your old gardener.
Removing a contact is easy, if unfortunate. Tap a contact and then tap Edit. 
Scroll to the bottom of the Edit screen and tap Delete Contact. You get one 
more chance to change your mind.
And that, gentle reader, should be pretty much all you need to work with 
Contacts. Onward!

e’d venture to say that no one bought an iPad mini because of Notes, 
Clock, Reminders, or Game Center. Still, these apps help make the 
iPad mini indispensable on a daily basis.
In addition to the indispensable apps described in this 
chapter, we also demonstrate how to create a Wi-Fi 
hotspot no matter where you are (all iPads minis with 
4G features) and how to share with AirDrop.
Taking Note of Notes
Notes is an app that creates text notes that you can 
save or send through email. To create a note, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Notes icon.
	
	
2.	Tap the new note icon (shown in the margin) in the 
upper-right corner to start a new note.
	
	 The virtual keyboard appears.
	
3.	Type a note, such as the one shown in Figure 13-1.

238
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
You can use Siri to set up and dictate 
your note by speaking on all iPad 
mini models. (You hear more about 
Siri in Chapter 14.)
Other things you can do before you 
quit the Notes app include
	
✓	Tap the Notes or Folders button 
in the upper-left corner of the 
screen to see either a list of all 
your notes or, if you sync Notes 
with more than one account, 
such as iCloud, Google, or 
Yahoo!, folders for All Notes 
plus a separate folder for each 
service you use.
	
✓	When the list is on-screen, tap 
a folder to see its contents, or 
tap a note to open and view, 
edit, or modify it. (Hint: The list 
is always visible when you hold 
your iPad mini in landscape 
mode with the longer edges parallel to the ground.)
	
	
✓	Tap the share icon at the top-right corner (and shown in the margin) to 
send the note using the Mail or Messages app (see Chapter 5 for more 
about Mail and iMessage), copy the note to the Clipboard (see Chapter 2 
for the scoop on copy and paste), or print the note (see Chapter 2 for 
more about printing).
	
✓	Tap the trash icon near the top-right corner of the screen to delete 
the note.
As with most iPad apps, your notes are saved automatically while you type 
them so that you can quit Notes at any time without losing a single character.
We’d be remiss if we didn’t remind you one last time that you can sync Notes 
with your Mac and other devices via iCloud. We’d be remiss also if we didn’t 
mention that unlike other sync functions, you don’t enable Notes syncing 
in iTunes. Instead, you enable it in Settings➪iCloud on your iPad mini and 
System Preferences➪iCloud on your Mac.
And that’s all she wrote. You now know what you need to know about creat-
ing and managing notes with Notes.

Remembering with Reminders
You can find lots of good to-do list 
apps in the App Store; if you don’t 
believe us, search for to-do list. You’ll 
find more than 100 offerings for 
the iPad. Many are free, but others 
sell (and sell briskly, we might add) 
at prices up to $30 or $40. Most of 
these third-party reminder apps 
have nothing to worry about from 
the Reminders app, although some 
people love it.
What you get for free is Reminders, 
a simple to-do list app for making 
and organizing lists, with optional 
reminders available for items in 
your lists.
Tap the Reminders icon on your 
Home screen, and you’ll see some-
thing that looks like Figure 13-2.
Reminders on the right side of the 
screen in Figure 13-2 belong to a list called Next Actions, as indicated by it 
being highlighted on the left side of the screen.
Working with lists
To create a list, tap Add List in the lower-left corner of the screen, type a 
name for the list on the virtual keyboard, and then tap Done. You can have as 
many or as few lists as you like.
To manage the lists you create, tap the Edit button at the bottom of the 
screen, shown in Figure 13-2. When you do, the left side of the screen goes 
into what we like to think of as edit mode, as shown in Figure 13-3.
From this screen, you can
	
✓	Delete a list: Tap the red minus sign for the list. The list’s name slides to 
the left and reveals a red Delete button (see Bob’s Recurring To-Do’s in 
Figure 13-3).
	
	You can also delete a list without first tapping the Edit button by swiping 
the list’s name from right to left. The red Delete button appears on the 
right; tap it to delete the list or tap anywhere else to cancel.
Figure 13-2: The Reminders app.

240
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
	
	
✓	Reorder (move up or down) lists: Press and 
hold your finger on the three horizontal lines 
(shown in the margin) to the right of a list’s 
name in edit mode, and then drag the name 
up or down. When the list’s name is where 
you want it, lift your finger. Note that the 
number of items in the list appears to the 
left of the three horizontal lines.
Setting up reminders
Reminders is a simple app, and the steps for man-
aging reminders are equally simple. Here’s how to 
remind yourself of something:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the Reminders app.
	
2.	On the left side of the screen, tap the list to 
which you want to attach the reminder.
	
	 If you haven’t created your own lists, you’ll 
see the two default lists: Reminders and 
Scheduled. Otherwise, you’ll see a list of all 
the reminder lists you’ve created.
	
	 The virtual keyboard appears.
	
3.	Type a title for the new reminder.
	
	 You can dictate your reminder instead of 
typing it if you’re using any iPad mini. You can 
find out more about dictation in Chapter 14.
	
	 The item appears in the current reminders list.
	
	 At this point, your reminder is bare-bones; 
its date, repeat, and priority options have 
not been activated.
	
4.	Tap the reminder and then tap the little 
i-in-a-circle to set the following options in 
the details overlay, as shown in Figure 13-4:
	
•	Remind Me on a Day: Tap if you want 
to specify a day and time for this 
reminder. If you have a 3G or 4G iPad 
mini, you can also set a location-based 
reminder. Just tap the At a Location 
switch (not shown in Figure 13-4 
because this particular iPad mini is 
Wi-Fi–only) to enable it, specify the 
location, and then choose When I 
Arrive, or When I Leave.
Figure 13-3: Tap the Edit button 
to create, delete, or reorder 
your lists.
Figure 13-4: Details for Our 
Shiny New Reminder.

241
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
	
	Location-based reminders will suck your iPad battery dry faster 
than almost anything else. Remember to mark location-based 
reminders as completed by tapping their check boxes when you 
finish them. Otherwise, you will be reminded of something you’ve 
already done every time you pass that location and it will drain 
your iPad battery unnecessarily.
	
	If you set a location-based reminder with an iPhone or iPad with 3G 
or 4G, or with the Reminders app in OS X Mountain Lion or later, 
the reminder syncs with your Wi-Fi-only iPad but without the loca-
tion. In fact, you won’t even see the At a Location switch if your 
iPad is Wi-Fi–only (as in Figure 13-4).
	
•	Repeat: After you set a reminder, you’ll notice that a Repeat button 
appears. Tap it if you want to set a second reminder for a different 
day or time.
	
•	Priority: Tap to specify a priority for this reminder. You can select 
None, Low, Medium, or High.
	
•	List: Tap if you want this reminder to appear in a list other than the 
one it currently appears in. Then tap the list to which you want to 
move this reminder.
	
•	Notes: If you have anything else to add, tap the Notes field and 
type away.
	
5.	After you’ve set your options, tap the Done button in the upper-right 
corner of the details overlay.
	
Choose the list you want your new reminder to appear on before you create it.
Viewing and checking off reminders
After you create reminders, the app helps you see what you have and haven’t 
done and enables you to do the following tasks:
	
✓	Check off reminders. You probably noticed that every reminder you 
create includes a hollow circle to its left. Tap the circle to indicate that 
a task has been completed. When you do, the words Hide (or Show) 
Completed appear at the bottom of the list. Tap these words to hide or 
show tasks you’ve completed in this list.
	
✓	Search reminders. To search for a word or phrase in all your reminders, 
completed or not, tap the search field at the upper left, type your word 
or phrase, and then tap the search icon (magnifying glass). Or swipe 
down from the middle of any Home screen to search for it with Spotlight.
	
✓	Keep reminders on your Mac or PC. You can create reminders on your 
Mac or PC with To Do items in iCal (Lion), Reminders (Mountain Lion or 
Mavericks), or Tasks in Outlook. And if you’re using iCloud, your remind-
ers will always be up to date on all your devices.

Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
That’s about it. The Reminders app isn’t a bad effort. If it lacks a feature or 
two that you desire, check out the myriad third-party to-do list apps in the 
App Store.
Negotiating Notification Center
Notification Center, shown in 
Figure 13-5, drops down over what-
ever you’re doing at the time so that 
you can easily see calendar entries, 
reminders, the weather forecast, and 
new email messages. Notification 
Center works regardless of which 
app you’re using.
To summon Notification Center 
to the forefront of your iPad mini 
screen, all you need is the magical 
incantation — that is, a swipe from 
the top of the screen downward. Go 
ahead and give it a try. We’ll wait.
Notifications also appear on the 
lock screen, as shown in Figure 13-6. 
Banner notifications are sweet, and 
we’re particularly fond of sliding 
our finger to view a particular item. 
But we digress. You find out how to 
enable or disable banner and alert 
notifications for individual apps, but 
not until Chapter 15.
Here’s what you need to know about navigating Notification Center:
	
✓	Close Notification Center. Swipe or flick upward the arrow that looks 
like a caret symbol (^) at the bottom of the list (refer to Figure 13-5).
	
✓	Open a notification. Tap the notification, and it opens in the appropriate 
program.
	
✓	Clear a single notification. Tap the little circle to the left of the notifica-
tion and it disappears.
	
✓	The Today and Notification tabs at the top of the screen provide dif-
ferent filters for your notifications. Tap them to see the way each pres-
ents information. Note that some details, such as today’s weather and 
the Tomorrow section, appear only on the Today tab.
Figure 13-5: Notification Center in all its 
splendor.

243
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
	
	You can switch between the 
Today and Notifications screens 
also by swiping from left to right 
and right to left.
	
✓	Clear all notifications from 
a particular app. Tap the 
Notifications tab at the top of the 
screen. (You can’t use the Today 
tab to clear all notifications from 
a particular app.) Now tap the 
little x-in-a-circle to the right 
of the app’s name (Reminders, 
Calendar, Messages, and such). 
The x turns into a Clear button. 
Tap the Clear button and all 
notifications from that app are 
cleared and the app’s name dis-
appears from Notification Center 
(but the name will reappear 
if the app needs to notify you 
again).
That’s how to summon and use 
Notification Center. There’s still a bit 
more to know — including how to change the notification settings for indi-
vidual apps — but you have to wait until the chapter on settings (which hap-
pens to be Chapter 15).
Punching the Clock
Well, yes, most tablets do have a clock. But not every tablet has a world clock 
that lets you display the time in multiple cities on multiple continents. And 
not every device also has an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer to boot.
So tap the Clock icon on your Home screen or in Control Center (new in iOS 8) 
and see what the Clock app is all about.
World clock
Want to know the time in Beijing or Bogota? Tapping World Clock (in the 
Clock app) lets you display the time in numerous cities around the globe, as 
shown in Figure 13-7. When the clock face is dark, it’s nighttime in the city 
you chose; if the face is white, it’s daytime outside.
Figure 13-6: Notifications on the lock screen; 
slide your finger on one to open it.

244
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
To add a city to the 
world clock, tap the + in 
the middle of the right-
most clock face (the 
one labeled Add), and 
then use the virtual key-
board to start typing a 
city name, as shown in 
Figure 13-8. (If you don’t 
see the + clock face, 
you probably have six 
or more clocks. To see 
the rest of the clocks 
and the clock with the +, 
swipe the clocks from 
right to left.)
The moment you press 
the first letter, the iPad displays a list of cities 
or countries that begin with that letter. So, as 
Figure 13-8 shows, typing v brings up Andorra la 
Vella, Andora; Bantam Village, Cocos (Keeling) 
Islands; and Boa Vista, Brazil, among myriad 
other possibilities. You can create clocks for as 
many cities as you like, though only six cities at a 
time appear on-screen.
To remove a city from the list, tap Edit and then 
tap the red circle with the white horizontal line 
that appears to the left of the city you want to 
drop. Then tap Delete.
You can also rearrange the order of the cities 
displaying the time. Tap Edit, and then press your 
finger against the symbol with three horizontal lines to the right of the city 
you want to move up or down in the list. Then drag the city to its new spot.
Alarm
Ever try to set the alarm in a hotel room? It’s remarkable how complicated 
setting an alarm can be, on even the most inexpensive clock radio. Like 
almost everything else, the procedure is dirt-simple on the iPad mini:
	
1.	Tap Clock on the Home screen or Control Center to display the 
Clock app.
	
2.	Tap the Alarm icon at the bottom of the screen.
Figure 13-7: What time is it in Tokyo?
Figure 13-8: Clocking in around 
the world.

245
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
	
3.	Tap the + button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
4.	Choose the time of the alarm by rotating the wheel in the bottom half 
of the screen.
	
	 This step is similar to the action required to set the time that an event 
starts or ends on your calendar.
	
5.	Tap Save when the alarm settings are to your liking.
That’s what you can do with a regular alarm clock. What’s the big deal, you 
say? Well, you can do even more with your iPad alarm:
	
✓	Set the alarm to go off on other days. Tap Repeat and then tell the iPad 
the days you want the alarm to be repeated, as in Every Monday, Every 
Tuesday, Every Wednesday, and so on.
	
✓	Choose your own sound. Tap Sound to choose the tone that will wake 
you up. You can even use songs from your Music library and any custom 
tones stored on your iPad.
	
	Your choice is a matter of personal preference, but we can tell you that 
the ringtone for the appropriately named Alarm managed to wake Ed 
from a deep sleep.
	
✓	Set the snooze to sleep in. Tap Snooze on (showing green) to display 
a Snooze button along with the alarm. Tap the Snooze button to shut 
down the alarm for nine minutes.
	
✓	Name your alarm. If you want to call the alarm something other than, 
um, Alarm, tap the Label field and use the virtual keyboard to type 
another descriptor.
	
Simple stuff, really. But if you want really simple, you can ask Siri to set the 
alarm for you. See Chapter 14 for how to use Siri.
You know that an alarm has been set and activated because of the tiny status 
icon (surprise, surprise — it looks like a clock) that appears on the status bar 
in the upper-right corner of the screen.
An alarm takes precedence over any tracks you’re listening to on your iPad. 
Songs momentarily pause when an alarm goes off and resume when you turn 
off the alarm (or press the Snooze button).
	
When your ring/silent switch is set to Silent, your iPad mini still plays alarms 
from the Clock app. It stays silent for FaceTime calls, alert sounds, or audio 
from apps. But it will play alarms from the Clock app.
Although it seems obvious, if you want to actually hear an alarm, you have to 
make sure that the iPad volume is turned up loud enough for you to hear.

246
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
Stopwatch
If you’re helping a loved one train for a marathon, the iPad Stopwatch func-
tion can provide an assist. Open it by tapping Stopwatch in the Clock app.
Just tap Start to begin the count, and then tap Stop when your trainee arrives 
at the finish line. You can also tap the Lap button to monitor the times of indi-
vidual laps.
Timer
Cooking a hard-boiled egg or Thanksgiving turkey? Again, the iPad comes to 
the rescue. Tap Timer (in the Clock app) and then rotate the hour and minute 
wheels until the length of time you desire is highlighted.
	
	 Tap the sounds icon (shown in the margin) near the bottom of the screen to 
choose the ringtone that will signify time’s up.
After you set the length of the timer, tap Start when you’re ready to begin. 
You can watch the minutes and seconds wind down on the screen, if you 
have nothing better to do. Or tap Pause to pause the countdown temporarily.
If you’re doing anything else on the iPad — admiring photos, say — you hear 
the ringtone and see a Timer Done message on the screen at the appropriate 
moment. Tap OK to silence the ringtone.
Socializing with Social Media Apps
At first glance, the iPad appears light on social media support because Game 
Center is the only sign of social media on a new iPad. Still, iOS 8 is much 
more friendly to social media than it appears at first glance. Although your 
iPad doesn’t come with official Facebook or Twitter apps, support for the two 
most popular social networks is baked right into iOS.
You can find free apps for these social media networks (and many others) 
in the App Store, but iOS 8 lets you install the Facebook and Twitter apps 
without even having to visit the App Store. Just tap Settings➪Facebook (or 
Twitter), and then tap the Install button to install the app you’ve chosen.
	
You don’t necessarily need an app to participate in social networking. The 
networks we talk about in this section can be fully utilized using Safari on 
your iPad. And frankly, unlike the iPhone, where the Safari experience is ham-
pered by the tiny screen and keyboard, the websites are eminently usable on 
your iPad mini. So, if you want to check them out and don’t feel like down-
loading their apps, here are their URLs:

247
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
	
✓	Facebook: www.facebook.com
	
✓	Twitter: http://twitter.com
We’d be remiss if we didn’t at least point out some of the niceties you get 
when you access one of these social media networks by using an app instead 
of a browser, so the following sections offer a few of our insights.
If you use Facebook or Twitter, the first thing to do, regardless of whether 
you intend to use the apps, is to tap Settings➪Facebook and Settings➪Twitter 
and provide your usernames and passwords. This will let you share photos, 
maps and directions, videos, URLs, and much more by tapping the share icon 
and then tapping the icon for Facebook or Twitter.
Facebook
The Facebook iPad app, as shown in Figure 13-9, makes it easy to access the 
most popular Facebook features with a single finger tap.
Figure 13-9: Bob’s Facebook news feed, as shown in the Facebook iPad app (left) and Safari  
(right); you can use either (or both) to get your Facebook fix.
Note that the Facebook iPad app has a slick interface with quick access to 
many popular Facebook features, as shown on the left in Figure 13-9.

248
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
The biggest difference between Facebook on Safari versus the app may be 
that Safari can’t provide push notifications for Facebook events such as mes-
sages, timeline posts, friend requests and confirmations, photo tags, events, 
or comments, whereas the iPad app does all that and more.
The bottom line is that there’s nothing to prevent having the best of both 
worlds. So if you’re a heavy Facebook user, consider using the Facebook iPad 
app for some things (such as push notifications and status updates) and 
Safari for others (such as reading your wall or news feeds).
Twitter
Twitter puts a slightly different spin on social networking. Unlike Facebook, 
it doesn’t try to be all-encompassing or offer dozens of features, hoping that 
some of them will appeal to you. Instead, Twitter does one thing and does it 
well. That thing is letting its users post short messages, or tweets, quickly and 
easily from a variety of platforms, including web browsers, mobile phones, 
smartphones, and other devices.
Twitter users then have the option 
of following any other Twitter user’s 
tweets. The result is a stream of 
short messages like the ones shown 
in Figure 13-10.
	
A tweet is 140 characters or fewer 
(including spaces). This tip, for 
example, is precisely 140 characters. 
Bottom line: Omit needless words.
Game Center
Game Center is the odd duck of the 
bunch. Unlike the other apps we 
cover in this section, Game Center 
has no website; you have to use 
the Game Center app that came 
with your iPad mini. And unlike the 
others, which are broad-based and 
aimed at anyone and everyone, 
Game Center is designed for a spe-
cific segment of the iPad (and iPhone 
and iPod touch) universe — namely, 
users who have one or more games on their iPads (or other devices).
Mac users can get in on the fun, too, as long as they’re using Mountain Lion, 
Mavericks, or Yosemite, which include a Game Center app similar to the one 
on your iPad mini.
Figure 13-10: The official Twitter iPad app 
through the eyes of Bob (@LeVitus).

249
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
Game Center acts as a 
match-up service, let-
ting you challenge your 
friends or use its Auto-
Match Invite Friend 
button to challenge a 
stranger who is looking 
for someone to play 
against.
Game Center supports 
thousands upon thou-
sands of games these 
days, some of which are 
shown in Figure 13-11.
The games include 
many top sellers, such 
as Angry Birds, Real Racing 2 HD, Fairway Solitaire, and Bob’s current game 
obsession, the stunning Real Racing 3.
Sharing Your Connection (Personal Hotspot)
The personal hotspot is a feature that lets any iPad mini with Wi-Fi + 4G share 
its cellular high-speed data connection with other devices, including comput-
ers, iPod touches, and other iPads.
	
If your iPad mini is Wi-Fi–only, feel free to skip this section — the Personal 
Hotspot option is available only on cellular iPads.
To enable your personal hotspot and share your cellular data connection 
with others, do the following:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap Settings.
	
2.	Tap Personal Hotspot.
	
3.	Tap the Personal Hotspot switch to enable it (it will turn green).
	
4.	Tap Wi-Fi Password and create or change the password for the Wi-Fi 
network you create.
Now Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB-enabled devices can join your hotspot network 
and share your iPad’s cellular data connection.
	
Your personal hotspot network adopts your iPad’s name, which is Bob L’s 
iPad 64 (3d-gen) in Figure 13-12.
Figure 13-11: Some of the games with Game Center support.

250
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
At the time we wrote 
this, most carriers 
offered support for per-
sonal hotspots in some 
or all of their data plans 
in the United States. 
Some don’t, so check 
with your carrier if you 
don’t see a Personal 
Hotspot option in the 
Settings app (and, of 
course, if your iPad 
has 4G).
	
Verizon doesn’t charge 
extra for this feature, 
but the data used by 
connected devices 
counts against your 
monthly data plan 
allotment.
To see how much data you’re using, tap Settings➪General➪Usage➪Cellular 
Usage.
Dropping In on AirDrop
At various points when you’re using your iPad mini, you encounter AirDrop, 
a fast, safe, and secure (through encryption) wireless method of sharing 
photos, videos, contacts, documents, and more with people you are close to 
physically.
	
	 You just tap the share icon (shown in the margin) in any app that offers one. 
AirDrop exploits both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. No advanced setup is required.
	
To be part of an AirDrop exchange, you and the recipient must be using iOS 7 
or later and have an iPhone 5 or later, a fourth-generation iPad or later, any 
iPad mini, a fifth-generation iPod touch, or a Mac running Yosemite or later.
Taking advantage of this clever feature involves three simple steps:
	
1.	Turn on the AirDrop feature (if it’s not on already) in Control Center.
	
	 You have the option to make your phone visible to Everyone (within the 
vicinity) or just to your contacts.
	
2.	Tap the share icon when it presents itself in an app and choose the 
file or files that you want to share.
Figure 13-12: Devices can join this network via Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, or USB by following the appropriate connection 
instructions.

251
 Chapter 13: Indispensable iPad mini Utilities
	
3.	Choose the recipients of those items by tap-
ping the circle for the person, as shown in 
Figure 13-13.
Yes, you can choose more than one person. 
People in range who are eligible to receive the 
file are represented on your iPad by a circle. (The 
circles may even contain their pictures.)
The AirDrop process hath begun. The people on 
the receiving end will get a prompt asking them 
to accept the picture, video, or whatever it is 
you’re offering them, as shown in Figure 13-14.
Assuming they take kindly to your offer and 
grant permission (by tapping Accept rather than 
Decline), the file lands on their devices in short 
order, where it is routed to its proper location. 
That is, a picture or video ends up in the Photos 
app, a contact in the Contacts app, and the 
Passbook pass in the Passbook app.

circle to send the items to him.

H
 
ow could you not love Siri? The intelligent, voice-activated vir-
tual personal assistant living like a genie inside the iPad 
mini not only hears what you have to say but also attempts 
to figure out the intent of your words. Siri then does her 
darnedest to respond to your wishes. She — yes, it’s 
a female voice (at least until you change it) — can 
help you dictate and send a message, get directions, 
call a friend, discover who won the ballgame, tell 
you when a movie is playing, ID the song playing in 
the background, arrange a wake-up call, search the 
web, find a decent place to eat, and lots more. Siri 
talks back, too, sometimes with humor and other 
times with attitude. When Ed told Siri he was tired, 
she responded with, “That’s fine. I just hope you’re 
not doing anything dangerous.”
Siri isn’t perfect. Sometimes Siri mishears us, occasionally 
more often than we’d like, and other times she doesn’t quite 
know what we have in mind. But blemishes and all, we think she’s 
pretty special — and she’s become smarter along the way.
Come to think of it, we should probably stop referring to Siri as she, even 
though she, um, started that way. You can now choose a male or female 
voice to represent Siri — and yes, we’ll resist making any other transgender 

254
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
references. We’ll also resist saying much more about Siri until later in this chap-
ter because we want to get to one of the most helpful features on your iPad 
mini, Control Center, which Apple correctly points out is merely a swipe away.
Controlling Control Center
As its name suggests, Control Center is a single repository for the controls, 
apps, and settings you frequently call upon. Indeed, you will almost certainly 
spend a lot more time in Control Center than in Settings.
To access Control Center, swipe up from the bottom of the screen — any 
screen. The beauty of Control Center is that it’s always available when you 
need it.
Now, take a gander at 
Figure 14-1 to get an 
immediate handle on all 
the things that Control 
Center lets you get at 
right away.
We start the Control 
Center tour on the 
upper row and move 
from left to right. You 
see controls for any 
music you might be 
playing at the time, as 
shown in Figure 14-1. The song can be playing on the iPad mini’s own Music 
app, or through a third-party app such as Spotify — which is, in fact, how the 
song is playing in this example. Next, you see icons for airplane mode (see 
Chapter 15 for more), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb, the screen’s orienta-
tion lock, along with a brightness control.
Drop down to the bottom row, and you have the volume control on the left. 
Next, you may see controls for AirDrop and AirPlay. The former is a way to 
share pictures, videos, and other files wirelessly with folks nearby who have 
recent iOS 7 or iOS 8 devices of their own and Bluetooth turned on. AirPlay 
is a way to stream music and movies wirelessly via Wi-Fi to Apple TVs and 
to compatible AirPlay-enabled speakers and receivers. We discuss AirPlay in 
greater depth in Chapter 8. And on the bottom right are icons for the timer 
(part of the Clock app) and the camera.
	
You can permit or deny access to Control Center on the lock screen in 
Settings. You can also allow or refuse access to Control Center from within 
apps. Either way, Apple assumes that you’ll use Control Center all the time. 
We agree.
Figure 14-1: Control Center is merely a swipe away.

 Chapter 14: Taking iPad mini Controls Siri-ously
Summoning Siri
When you first set up the iPad 
mini, you have the option of turn-
ing on Siri. If you did so, you’re 
good to go. If you didn’t, tap 
Settings➪General➪Siri, and flip the 
switch on so that green is showing.
You can call Siri into action in a 
few ways. The traditional way is 
to press and hold down the Home 
button until you hear a tone. Pretty 
simple, eh? The question, “What 
can I help you with?” appears on-
screen, as shown in Figure 14-2. Start 
talking, and your question appears 
on-screen.
	
A feature added with iOS 8 lets you 
summon Siri by merely saying, “Hey 
Siri.” And yes, this is Apple’s answer 
to the “OK Google” voice command 
on Android devices. However, you 
have to connect your iPad to power 
to take advantage of the “Hey Siri” feature.
Siri also responds when you press a button on a Bluetooth headset.
	
We should point out that having Siri turned on is a prerequisite to using dicta-
tion on your iPad mini, discussed later in this chapter.
What happens next is up to you. You can ask a wide range of questions or 
issue voice commands. If you didn’t get your words out fast enough or you 
were misunderstood, tap the microphone icon at the bottom of the screen 
and try again.
Siri relies on voice recognition and artificial intelligence (hers, not yours). 
The voice genie responds in a conversational (if still ever-so-slightly robotic) 
manner. But using Siri isn’t entirely a hands-free experience. Spoken words 
are supplemented by information on the iPad screen (as you see in the next 
section).
Just where does Siri get that information? By tapping into Location Services 
and seeking answers from the web using sources such as Bing, Wikipedia, 
Yelp, Yahoo!, Open Table, Twitter, and WolframAlpha, which you can learn 
more about in the nearby sidebar.
Figure 14-2: Siri is eager to respond.

256
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
And Siri on the iPad mini can open apps — Apple’s own as well as third-
party apps. Indeed, from your contacts, Siri might be able to determine who 
your spouse, coworkers, and friends are, as well as knowing where you live. 
You might ask, “How do I get home from here?” and Siri will fire up Maps to 
help you on your way. Or you can say, “Find a good Italian restaurant near 
Barbara’s house,” and Siri will serve 
up a list, sorted by Yelp rating. Using 
Open Table, Siri can even make a res-
taurant reservation.
	
Siri requires Internet access. A lot of 
factors go into accuracy, including 
surrounding noises and unfamiliar 
accents. And you also need to be 
comfortable with the fact that Apple 
is recording what you say.
Figuring Out What to Ask
The beauty of Siri is that there’s no 
designated protocol you must follow 
when talking to her. Asking, “Will I 
need an umbrella tomorrow?” pro-
duces the same result as, “What is 
the weather forecast around here?” 
(See Figure 14-3.)
Making your iPad mini (and other  
computers) really smart
Chances are you haven’t heard of 
WolframAlpha. But if you want to know the 
gross domestic product of France or find 
events that happened on the day you were 
born, WolframAlpha can deliver such facts. You 
don’t search the web per se on WolframAlpha 
as you would using a service such as Google. 
WolframAlpha describes itself as a “new way to 
get knowledge . . . by doing dynamic computa-
tions based on a vast collection of built-in data, 
algorithms, and methods.” It taps into knowl-
edge curated by human “experts.” So you can 
get nutritional information for peanut M&Ms or 
compute a growth chart for your 4-foot, 7-inch 
10-year-old daughter.
There’s a reason that Siri relies on this “com-
putational knowledge engine,” which was 
driven over a period of nearly 30 years by really 
smart guy Stephen Wolfram. We also recom-
mend checking out the $2.99 WolframAlpha 
app for your iPad, which gives you broader 
access to the knowledge engine, beyond 
where Siri goes.
Figure 14-3: Siri can get you the weather.

257
 Chapter 14: Taking iPad mini Controls Siri-ously
	
We think it’s pretty darn cool that 
Siri now teams up with one of our 
favorite apps, Shazam, to identify the 
name and artist of the musical track 
that’s playing. Just ask Siri what song 
is playing and she’ll name that tune 
(assuming that she indeed knows the 
song). When the song is properly 
identified, you even get a chance to 
buy it.
If you’re not sure what to ask, 
tap the ?-in-a-circle to list sample 
questions or commands, as shown 
in Figure 14-4. You can tap any of 
these examples to see even more 
samples.
Here are some ways Siri can lend a 
hand . . . um, we mean a voice:
	
✓	FaceTime: “FaceTime phone 
number my wife.”
	
✓	Music: “Play Frank Sinatra” or “Play iTunes Radio.” “What song is this?” 
“Rate this song three stars.”
	
✓	Messages: “Send a message to Nancy to reschedule lunch.”
	
✓	Calendar: “Set up a meeting for 9 a.m. to discuss funding.”
	
✓	Reminders: “Remind me to take my medicine at 8 a.m. tomorrow.”
	
✓	Maps: “Find an ATM near here.”
	
✓	Mail: “Mail the tenant about the recent rent check.”
	
✓	Stocks: “What’s Apple’s stock price?”
	
✓	Web search: “Who was the 19th president of the United States?”
	
✓	WolframAlpha: “How many calories are in a blueberry muffin?”
	
✓	Clock: “Wake me up at 8:30 in the morning.”
	
✓	Sports: “Who is pitching for the Yankees tonight?”
	
✓	Trivia: “Who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 2003?”
	
✓	Twitter: “Send tweet, Going on vacation, smiley-face emoticon” or “What 
is trending on Twitter?”
Figure 14-4: Siri can help out in many ways.

Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
Correcting Mistakes
As we point out earlier, as good as Siri is, she sometimes needs to be cor-
rected. Fortunately, you can correct her mistakes fairly easily. The simplest 
way is to tap the microphone icon and try your query again. You can say 
something along the lines of, “I meant Botswana.”
You can also tap your question to edit or fix what Siri thinks you said. You 
can make edits by using the keyboard or by voice. If a word is underlined, 
you can use the keyboard to make a correction.
Siri seeks your permission before sending a dictated message. That’s a safe-
guard you come to appreciate. If you need to modify the message, you can 
do so by saying such things as, “Change Tuesday to Wednesday” or “Add: I’m 
excited to see you, exclamation mark” — indeed, I’m excited to see you and an ! 
will be added.
Using Dictation
Through a dictation function, you can speak to your iPad mini and the words 
you say are translated into text. It’s easy and usually works pretty well. Even 
if you’re a pretty good virtual-keyboard typist or use a Bluetooth keyboard 
(see Chapter 17), dictation is often the fastest way to get your words into 
your iPad.
You can enable dictation without 
enabling Siri and vice versa.
When you want to use your voice to 
enter text, tap the microphone key 
(see Figure 14-5) on the virtual key-
board that appears in the app you’re 
using. Begin speaking right away. 
You’ll see the wavy lines as you talk.
The first time you tap the microphone key, a dialog appears asking if you 
want to enable dictation. Your humble authors are never shy about using 
our voices, so we happily agree. But why might you choose otherwise? Your 
voice input, contacts, and location are shared with Apple, which makes some 
people uncomfortable.
You can always enable or disable dictation later. Go to Settings➪General➪ 
Keyboard and tap to turn the Enable Dictation switch on or off. When you 
disable dictation, you will no longer see the microphone key in the keyboard 
until you enable dictation again.
Figure 14-5: Tap the microphone key to begin 
dictation; tap anywhere on-screen to end it.

259
 Chapter 14: Taking iPad mini Controls Siri-ously
	
Dictation works only if you’re connected to the Internet. If you’re not con-
nected, the microphone key will appear dimmed.
Some apps don’t display the microphone key on the keyboard. If you don’t 
see a microphone key, the app doesn’t accept dictated input.
Tap Done to end the dictation.
	
Here are a couple of ways you can improve your dictation experience:
	
✓	You can speak punctuation by saying it. So remember to say, “period,” 
“question mark,” or whatever at the end of your sentences. You can also 
insert commas, semicolons, dashes, and other punctuation by saying 
their names.
	
✓	The better your mini hears you, the better your results will be:
	
•	A wired headset with a microphone is great when you have a lot of 
ambient noise nearby.
	
•	A Bluetooth headset may be better than the built-in microphone.
	
•	If you use the iPad mini’s built-in mic, make sure the iPad case or 
your fingers aren’t covering it.
Making Siri Smarter
From Settings, you can tell Siri which language you want to converse in. Siri is 
available in English (United States, United Kingdom, Canadian, or Australian), 
as well as versions of Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and 
Spanish.
You can also request voice feedback from Siri all the time, or just when you’re 
using a hands-free headset.
In the My Info field in Settings, you can tell Siri who you are. When you tap 
My Info, your contacts list appears. Tap your own name in Contacts.
With iOS 7 and iOS 8, you can even choose whether Siri has either a male or 
female voice.
	
You can call upon Siri from the lock screen too. (That’s the default setting, 
anyway.) Consider this feature a mixed blessing. Not having to type a pass-
code to get Siri to do her thing is convenient. On the other hand, if your mini 
ends up with the wrong person, he or she would be able to use Siri to send an 
email or message in your name, post to Facebook, or tweet, bypassing 

260
Part IV: The iPad mini at Work 
whatever passcode security you thought was in place. If you find this poten-
tial scenario scary, tap Settings➪Touch ID & Passcode on the iPad mini 3 
(Settings➪Passcode on earlier models). Then enter your passcode and 
switch the Siri option under Allow Access When Locked from on (green is 
showing) to off (gray). You’ll see the Allow Siri option under Touch ID & 
Passcode only if Siri is enabled in the first place. For more on Settings, read 
Chapter 15.

o you consider yourself a control freak? The type of 
person who has to have it your way? Boy, have 
you landed in the right chapter.
Settings is kind of the makeover factory for the iPad 
mini. You open Settings by tapping its Home screen 
icon; from there, you can do things such as change 
the tablet’s background or wallpaper and specify 
the search engine of choice. You can also alter 
security settings in Safari, tailor email to your liking 
(among other modifications), and get a handle on 
how to fetch or push new data.
	
The Settings area on the iPad mini is roughly analogous 
to System Preferences on a Mac or the Control Panel in 
Windows, with a hearty serving of app preferences thrown in 
for good measure.
But you won’t have to visit Settings in every case because Control Center 
grants you immediate access to some settings and controls that used to 
require a separate visit to the Settings complex, including airplane mode and 

264
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
display brightness, which we address in this chapter. But even with Control 
Center, expect to make some tweaks in Settings from time to time. Because we 
cover some settings elsewhere in this book, we don’t dwell on every setting 
here. But you still have plenty to digest to help you make the mini your own.
Checking Out the Settings Screen
When you first open Settings, you 
see a display that looks something 
like Figure 15-1, with a scrollable list 
on the left side of the screen and a 
pane on the right that corresponds 
to whichever setting is highlighted in 
blue. We say “something like” because 
Settings on your iPad may differ 
slightly from what is shown here.
You must scroll down to see the 
entire list. Also, if you see a greater-
than symbol (>) to the right of a 
listing, the listing has a bunch of 
options. Throughout this chapter, 
you tap the > symbol to check out 
those options.
As you scroll to the bottom of the 
list on the left, you come to all the 
settings that pertain to some of the 
specific third-party apps you’ve 
added to the iPad. (See Chapter 11.) 
These settings aren’t visible in Figure 15-1. Everybody has a different collec-
tion of apps on his or her iPad, so settings related to those programs will also 
be different.
Flying with Sky-High Settings
Your iPad mini offers settings to keep you on the good side of air-traffic  
communications systems. No matter which iPad you have — Wi-Fi–only or 
a model with cellular — you have airplane mode.
Using a cellular radio on an airplane is a no-no. Wi-Fi is too, some of the 
time. But nothing is verboten about using an iPad mini on a plane to listen 
to music, watch videos, and peek at pictures. So how do you take advantage 
of the iPad’s built-in music player (among other capabilities) at 30,000 feet, 
while temporarily turning off your wireless gateway to email and Internet 
functions? By turning on airplane mode.
Figure 15-1: Your list of settings.

265
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
To do so, merely tap Airplane Mode on the Settings screen to enable the set-
ting. You’ll know it’s on rather than off when you see green instead of gray on 
the switch.
That act disables each of the mini’s wireless radios: Wi-Fi, cellular, and 
Bluetooth (depending on the model). While your iPad is in airplane mode, 
you can’t surf the web, get a map location, send or receive emails, sync 
through iCloud, use the iTunes or App Store, or do anything else that 
requires an Internet connection. If a silver lining exists here, it’s that the 
iPad’s long-lasting battery ought to last even longer — good news if the flight 
you’re on is taking you halfway around the planet.
	
	 The appearance of a tiny airplane icon on the status bar at the upper-left 
corner of the screen reminds you that airplane mode is turned on. Just 
remember to turn it off when you’re back on the ground.
	
If in-flight Wi-Fi is available on your flight, you can turn on Wi-Fi independently, 
leaving the rest of your iPad’s wireless radio safely disabled. And it’s a breeze 
to do by toggling the setting in Control Center.
Controlling Wi-Fi Connections
As we mention in Chapter 4, Wi-Fi 
is typically the fastest wireless net-
work that you can use to surf the 
web, send email, and perform other 
Internet tricks on the iPad. You use 
the Wi-Fi setting to determine which 
Wi-Fi networks are available to you 
and which one to exploit based on 
its signal.
Tap Wi-Fi so that the setting is on, 
and all Wi-Fi networks in range are 
displayed, as shown in Figure 15-2.
	
Tap the Wi-Fi switch off (gray) when-
ever you don’t have access to a net-
work and don’t want to drain the 
battery. You can easily toggle Wi-Fi 
on and off in Control Center.
A signal-strength indicator can help 
you choose the network to connect 
to if more than one is listed; tap the 
appropriate Wi-Fi network when you reach a decision. If a network is password-
protected, you see a lock icon and need the passcode to access it.
Figure 15-2: Check out your Wi-Fi options.

266
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
You can also turn the Ask to Join Networks setting on or off. Networks that 
the iPad is already familiar with are joined automatically, regardless of which 
one you choose. If the Ask feature is off and no known networks are available, 
you have to select a new network manually. If the Ask feature is on, you’re 
asked before joining a new network. Either way, you see a list with the same 
Wi-Fi networks in range.
The mini can also remember passwords for frequently used networks.
	
If you used a particular network automatically in the past but you no longer 
want your iPad to join it, tap the i-in-a-circle next to the network in question 
(in Wi-Fi settings) and then tap Forget This Network. The iPad develops a 
quick case of selective amnesia.
	
In some instances, you have to supply other technical information about a 
network you hope to glom on to. You encounter a bunch of nasty-sounding 
terms: DHCP, BootP, Static, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router, DNS, Search 
Domains, Client ID, HTTP Proxy, and Renew Lease. (At least this last one has 
nothing to do with renting an apartment or the vehicle you’re driving.) 
Chances are none of this info is on the tip of your tongue — but that’s okay. 
For one thing, it’s a good bet that you’ll never need to know this stuff. What’s 
more, even if you do have to fill in or adjust these settings, a network admin-
istrator or techie friend can probably help you.
Sometimes you may want to connect to a network that’s closed and not 
shown on the Wi-Fi list. If that’s the case, tap Other and use the keyboard to 
enter the network name. Then tap to choose the type of security setting the 
network is using (if any). Your choices are WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA Enterprise, 
and WPA2 Enterprise. Again, the terminology isn’t the friendliest in the world, 
but we figure that someone nearby can lend a hand.
	
If no Wi-Fi network is available, you have to rely on a cellular connection if 
you have capable models. If you don’t — or you’re out of reach of a cellular 
network — you can’t rocket into cyberspace until you regain access to a 
network.
Getting Fired Up over Bluetooth
Of all the peculiar terms you may encounter in techdom, Bluetooth is one 
of our favorites. The name is derived from Harald Blåtand, a tenth-century 
Danish monarch, who, the story goes, helped unite warring factions. And, 
we’re told, Blåtand translates to Bluetooth in English. (Bluetooth is all about 
collaboration between different types of devices — get it?)
Blåtand was obviously ahead of his time. Although we can’t imagine that 
he ever used a tablet computer, he now has an entire short-range wireless 

267
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
technology named in his honor. On the iPad, you can use Bluetooth to com-
municate wirelessly with a compatible Bluetooth headset or to use an optional 
wireless keyboard. Such accessories are made by Apple and many others.
To ensure that the iPad works with a device, it typically has to be wirelessly 
paired, or coupled, with the chosen device. If you’re using a third-party acces-
sory, follow the instructions that came with that headset or keyboard so that 
it becomes discoverable, or ready to be paired with your iPad. Then turn on 
Bluetooth (on the Settings screen) so that the iPad mini can find such nearby 
devices and the device can find the mini.
In Figure 15-3, an Apple wireless keyboard and 
the iPad are successfully paired when you enter 
a designated passkey on the keyboard. You won’t 
need a passkey to pair every kind of device, 
though. You can’t, for example, enter a passkey 
when pairing the iPad with a wireless speaker. 
Bluetooth works up to a range of about 30 feet.
	
	 You know Bluetooth is turned on when the 
Bluetooth icon (shown in the margin) is on the 
status bar. If the symbol is white, the iPad is 
communicating wirelessly with a connected device. If it’s gray, Bluetooth is 
turned on in the iPad, but a paired device isn’t nearby or isn’t turned on. If 
you don’t see a Bluetooth icon, the setting is turned off.
To unpair a device, select it from the device list and tap Forget This Device. 
We guess breaking up isn’t hard to do.
The iPad supports stereo Bluetooth headphones, letting you stream stereo 
audio from the iPad to those devices.
The mini can tap into Bluetooth in other ways. One is through peer-to-peer 
connectivity, so you can engage in multiplayer games with other nearby iPad, 
iPhone, or iPod touch users. You can also do such things as exchange busi-
ness cards, share pictures, and send short notes. In addition, you don’t even 
have to pair the devices as you do with a headset or wireless keyboard.
	
You can’t use Bluetooth to exchange files or sync between an iPad and a com-
puter. Nor can you use it to print stuff from the iPad on a Bluetooth printer 
(although the AirPrint feature handles that chore in some instances). That’s 
because the iPad doesn’t support any of the Bluetooth profiles (or specifica-
tions) required to allow such wireless stunts to take place — at least not as of 
this writing. We think that’s a shame.
You may also see devices that communicate with the iPad through a newer 
flavor of Bluetooth called Bluetooth Low Energy or sometimes Bluetooth 
Smart or Bluetooth Smart Ready.
Figure 15-3: Pairing an Apple 
wireless keyboard with the 
iPad.

268
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
You can wirelessly share files also through AirDrop, as noted in Chapter 13 
and elsewhere in this book.
Roaming among Cellular Data Options
You see another set of settings only if you have a cellular model iPad. The 
options appear on the right pane of the Settings screen when you highlight 
Cellular Data on the left:
	
✓	Cellular Data: If you know you don’t need the cellular network when 
you’re out and about or are in an area where you don’t have access to 
the network, turn it off. Your battery will thank you later. But even if you 
have access to a speedy cellular network, be prudent; in a 4G environ-
ment where you can easily consume gobs of data, your data allowance 
may run out all too quickly.
	
✓	Enable LTE: LTE stands for Long Term Evolution. What it really stands 
for is speed. Turn Enable LTE on for the fastest possible cellular data 
connection if you’re in range. The biggest disadvantage is that you can 
eat up data awfully fast.
	
✓	Data Roaming: You may unwittingly rack up lofty roaming fees when 
exchanging email, surfing with Safari, or engaging in other data-heavy 
activities while traveling abroad. Turn off Data Roaming to avoid such 
potential charges. You will see the Data Roaming option only if you have 
turned on Cellular Data.
	
✓	Account Information: Tap View Account to see or edit your account 
information or to add more data.
	
✓	Add a SIM PIN: The tiny SIM, or Subscriber Identity Module, card inside 
your iPad with cellular holds important data about your account. To 
add a PIN or a passcode to lock your SIM card, tap SIM PIN. That way, 
if someone gets hold of your SIM, he or she can’t use it in another iPad 
without the passcode.
	
	If you assign a PIN to your SIM, you have to enter it to turn the iPad on 
or off, which some might consider a minor hassle. And be aware that the 
SIM PIN is different from and may be in addition to any passcode you set 
for the iPad, as described later in this chapter.
	
✓	Personal Hotspot: Tap Personal Hotspot to share your iPad mini’s data 
connection with any other devices you carry: perhaps a computer or 
smartphone. Just know that extra charges may apply and even if it 
doesn’t you will rack up that much extra data. You or the owner of the 
device piggybacking on your Internet connection have to enter the des-
ignated password generated by the iPad for the Hotspot connection to 
make nice. You can use the hotspot feature via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, or by 
connecting a USB cable. See Chapter 13 to find out how to use Personal 
Hotspot.

269
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
	
✓	Use Cellular Data For: You can use your cellular connection for iCloud 
documents, iTunes, a Safari reading list, and certain third-party apps. 
You can see just how much data you’re using on your apps and, if need 
be, shut down an app that’s sucking up way too much. You can also 
decide whether or not to use cellular connections for FaceTime or for 
such system services as networking and Siri.
	
✓	Cellular Data Usage: This lists how much cellular data you’ve consumed 
for the current period. You also can see whether you’re using up data 
while roaming. Overall, you’ll know if you’re closing in on your monthly 
data allowance.
Managing Notifications
Through Apple’s Push Notification service, app developers can send you 
alerts related to programs you’ve installed on your iPad mini. Such alerts 
are typically in text form but may include sounds as well. The idea is that 
you’ll receive notifications even when the app they apply to isn’t running. 
Notifications may also appear as numbered badges on their corresponding 
Home screen icon.
The downside to keeping push notifications turned on is that they can curtail 
battery life (although honestly, we’ve been pretty satisfied with the iPad’s 
staying power, even when push notifications are active). And you may find 
notifications distracting at times.
You manage notifications on an app-by-app basis. To do so, tap Notification 
Center on the left side of the Settings screen, as shown in Figure 15-4, and 
then tap the app you want to manage. All installed apps that take advantage 
of Notification Center (see Chapter 13) appear on the right side of the panel, 
as shown in Figure 15-4, with the enabled apps displayed in the upper section 
(Include) and disabled apps in the lower section.
Tap any app to adjust its settings. Figure 15-5 shows notification settings 
for the Mail app (more specifically, Gmail). Some apps offer other options, 
including sound alerts, and other apps may offer fewer options, but we think 
you’ll figure it out.
To help you get started, here’s a rundown of the options shown in Figure 15-5, 
starting at the top:
	
✓	Show in Notification Center: Enable or disable notifications for this app 
in Notification Center. Straightforward enough.
	
✓	Notification Sound: Choose the sound that accompanies notifications of 
new mail messages. (The Ding sound is selected in Figure 15-5.) You can 
choose from a lengthy list of sound and ringtone alternatives and tap each 
possible choice to hear it. Or select None if you’re in the mood for quiet.

270
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
✓	Badge App Icon: Display the number of pending alerts on the app’s icon 
on your Home screen.
	
✓	Show on Lock Screen: See notifications for this app when your iPad 
mini screen is locked.
	
✓	Alert Style: Select the style of alert you want to see:
	
•	None: Notifications won’t appear spontaneously. They’ll still be 
available in Notification Center (swipe down from the top of the 
screen; see Chapter 13) but won’t interrupt your work (or play).
	
•	Banners: Display alerts as banners at the top of the screen and 
have them go away automatically.
	
•	Alerts: Display alerts that require action before proceeding.
	
✓	Show Previews: See the first part of the mail or iMessage as part of the 
notification in Notification Center.
Apps that don’t take advantage of Notification Center can still offer notifica-
tions, but you’ll have to scroll down to the Apps section on the left side of 
Settings and tap the app you want to alter. Note that the app you hope to 
fiddle with doesn’t always appear in the Apps section of Settings. For that 
matter, many of the apps that do appear in the list don’t offer notifications 
anyway.
Figure 15-4: Notify the iPad of your notification 
intentions.
Figure 15-5: Notification settings for the Mail 
app.

271
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
The broader point we’re trying to make is that we urge you to check out the 
settings for all the apps you see in this list. You’ll never know about many 
useful options if you don’t.
	
If you find you went overboard with notifications at first to the point where 
they become annoying or distracting, don’t fret. You can always go back and 
redo any notifications you’ve set up.
Many of the notifications delivered in iOS 8 are interactive, so you can 
respond to them on the spot. For example, you can reply to an incoming 
email or message without having to drop by the underlying app.
Here in Settings, you can determine whether to view Notification Center on 
the lock screen.
	
With the arrival of iOS 8, you can make a lot of modifications directly in 
Notification Center without paying a separate visit to Settings. In the today 
summary view, you get to choose whether to display traffic conditions, your 
calendar, reminders, and the tomorrow summary. Also new with iOS 8 is the 
capability to display compatible third-party widgets for apps you’ve installed 
on your iPad. To make such determinations, make sure the Today tab in 
Notification Center is highlighted and then tap Edit.
Apple understands that sometimes you don’t want to be bothered by notifi-
cations or other distractions, no matter how unobtrusive they might be. The 
result is a feature aptly named Do Not Disturb. Flip the switch so the setting 
is turned on (green), and a moon icon appears in the status bar. Then you 
can rest assured that your alerts are silenced until you turn the setting off. Of 
course, it’s even easier to turn this setting on or off in Control Center.
Controlling Control Center
We’ve already sung the praises of Control Center, the convenient utility that 
is no farther away than an upward swipe from the bottom of the screen. In 
Settings, you get to decide whether to make Control Center accessible from 
the lock screen and whether you can access it within apps. The switches for 
making these determinations are pretty straightforward.
Location, Location, Location Services
By using the onboard Maps or Camera apps (or any number of third-party 
apps), the iPad makes good use of knowing where you are. With Location 
Services turned on, your iPad mini has the capability to deliver traffic infor-
mation and suggest popular destinations in your vicinity. And at your discre-
tion, you can share your location with others.

272
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
iPads with cellular exploit built-in GPS to help determine your location. The 
Wi-Fi–only iPad can find your general whereabouts (by triangulating signals 
from Wi-Fi base stations and cellular towers).
If such statements creep you out a little, don’t 
fret. To protect your right to privacy, individual 
apps pop up quick messages (similar to the warn-
ing presented by Maps, shown in Figure 15-6) asking 
whether you want them to use your current 
location. You can also turn off Location Services 
in Settings: Tap Privacy and then tap Locations 
Services to turn off the setting. Not only is your 
privacy shielded, but you also keep your iPad 
battery juiced a little longer.
While visiting the Privacy setting, you may want to consult the privacy 
listings for individual apps on your iPad: Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, 
Photos, Bluetooth Sharing, and Microphone. If any third-party apps request 
access to these apps, they show up here.
From time to time on the iPad, you can land in the same destination multiple 
ways. For example, you can access the same privacy settings via the restric-
tions settings that we address later in this chapter.
Settings for Your Senses
A number of settings control what the iPad looks like and sounds like.
Brightening your day
The brightness slider shown in Figure 15-7 appears when the Display & Bright­
ness setting is highlighted. Who doesn’t want a bright, vibrant screen? Alas, 
the brightest screens exact a trade-off: Before you drag the control to the max, 
remember that brighter screens sap the life from your battery more quickly.
	
That’s why we recommend tapping the Auto-Brightness switch so that it’s on. 
The switch automatically adjusts the screen according to the lighting envi-
ronment in which you’re using the iPad — while at the same time being con-
siderate of your battery. And the Auto-Brightness control is one reason to 
adjust the brightness here, as opposed to Control Center: Auto Brightness is 
not available in Control Center.
	
If the app you’re spending time in supports dynamic type, you can adjust the 
type size by dragging a slider. Under Display & Brightness, you’ll also find a 
slider for making text bold. If you choose to apply the Bold Text setting, you’ll

know where you are.

273
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
have to restart your iPad. You’ll see similar options in the “Accessibility” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Wallpaper
Choosing wallpaper is a neat way to 
dress up the iPad according to your 
aesthetic preferences. iOS 7 and iOS 8 
include colorful dynamic animated 
wallpapers with floating bubbles 
that add a subtle dizzying effect. But 
stunning as they are, these images 
may not hold a candle to the mas-
terpieces in your own photo albums 
(more about those in Chapter 9).
You can sample the pretty patterns 
and dynamic designs that the iPad 
has already chosen for you, as 
follows:
	
1.	Tap Wallpaper and then tap 
Choose a New Wallpaper.
	
	 A list of your photo albums 
appears, along with Apple’s own 
wallpaper.
	
2.	Tap Apple Wallpaper (Dynamic 
or Stills) or one of your own 
photo albums in the list.
	
	 We chose Stills to bring up the thumbnails shown in Figure 15-8 (left).
	
3.	Tap a thumbnail image.
	
	 That image fills the screen, as shown in Figure 15-8 (right).
	
4.	When an image is full-screen, choose among the following options, 
which appear at the bottom of the screen:
	
•	Set Lock Screen: Your selected image is the wallpaper of choice 
when the iPad is locked.
	
•	Set Home Screen: The wallpaper decorates only your Home screen.
	
•	Set Both: Your image is the wallpaper for both the lock screen and 
the Home screen.
	
•	Perspective Zoom: Turn this motion effect on or off.
	
•	Cancel: Return to the thumbnail page without changing your Home 
or lock screen.

brightness.

Sounds
Consider the Sounds settings area the iPad mini’s soundstage. There, you 
can turn audio alerts on or off for a variety of functions: ringtones, text tones, 
new email, sent mail, calendar and reminder alerts, Facebook posts, tweets, 
and AirDrop. You can also decide whether you want to hear lock sounds and 
keyboard clicks.
You can alter the ringtone you hear for FaceTime calls and the text tones you 
hear for iMessages, and visit the iTunes Store to buy more text tones or ring-
tones, typically for $0.99 and $1.29 a pop, if you’re not satisfied with those 
that Apple supplies. (Mac owners can create their own by using GarageBand, 
as can folks who use GarageBand on an iPad. And the app is now free for 
folks who purchase new iOS 7 or iOS 8 devices.) To set a custom tone for 
individuals in the Contacts app, tap the Edit button and then tap either the 
Ringtone or the Text Tone option.
To raise the decibel level of alerts, drag the volume slider to the right. Drag in 
the opposite direction to bring down the noise. An alternative way to adjust 
sound levels is to use the physical volume buttons on the side of the mini, as 
long as you’re not already using the iPad’s iMusic or Videos player to listen to 
music or watch video, respectively.
You can enable and disable the use of physical buttons to alter the volume by 
using the Change with Buttons switch, below the volume slider.

 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Exploring Settings in General
Certain miscellaneous settings are difficult to pigeonhole. Apple wisely 
lumped these under the General settings moniker. Here’s a closer look at your 
options.
About About
You aren’t seeing double. This sec-
tion, as shown in Figure 15-9, is all 
about the About setting. And About 
is full of trivial (and not-so-trivial) 
information about the device. What 
you find here is straightforward:
	
✓	Network you use (cellular 
models only): AT&T, Sprint, 
T-Mobile, Verizon in the United 
States.
	
✓	Number of songs stored on the 
device
	
✓	Number of videos
	
✓	Number of photos
	
✓	Number of apps
	
✓	Storage capacity used and 
available: Because of the way 
the device is formatted, you 
always have a little less storage 
than the advertised amount of 
flash memory.
	
✓	Software version: As this book goes to press, we’re up to version 8.1. 
But as the software is tweaked and updated, your device takes on a 
new build identifier, indicating that it’s just a little bit further along than 
some previous build. In parentheses next to the version number, a string 
of numbers and letters, such as 12B410, tells you more precisely what 
software version you have. The number/letter string changes whenever 
the iPad’s software is updated and is potentially useful to some tech-
support person who might need to know the precise version.
	
✓	Carrier (Wi-Fi + cellular versions only): That’s AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, 
or Verizon in the United States.
	
✓	Serial and model numbers
	
✓	Cellular Data Number: For billing purposes only.
Figure 15-9: You find info about your iPad under 
About.

276
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
✓	Wi-Fi address
	
✓	Bluetooth address: See the earlier section to find out more about this 
setting.
	
✓	IMEI, ICCID, and MEID: These stand for International Mobile Equipment 
Identifier, International Circuit Card Identifier, and Mobile Equipment 
Identifier, respectively. They live up to their geeky acronyms by helping 
to identify your specific device.
	
✓	Modern Firmware: The version of your iPad’s firmware, which is a com-
bination of hardware and software that helps your iPad function as an 
iPad.
	
✓	Legal Notices, License, Warranty, Regulatory RF Exposure, and 
Trusted Certificates: You had to know that the lawyers would get in 
their two cents somehow. You find all the fine print here. And fine print it 
is because you can’t unpinch to enlarge the text as you can elsewhere on 
the iPad mini (not that we can imagine more than a handful will bother 
to read this legal mumbo jumbo).
Software Update
The Software Update section is self-explanatory. When Apple unleashes an 
update, such as the one that moved the device from iOS 7 to iOS 8, you can 
find it here.
Siri
We love that Siri, the chatty personal digital assistant who can remind you 
whether to take an umbrella or clue you in on how the Giants are faring in 
the NFL, has found her way to the iPad mini from her original hangout spot 
on the iPhone 4s. You can talk to Siri by pressing and holding down the Home 
button and speaking out loud. Siri will talk back.
If your mini is connected to power and running iOS 8, you can also summon 
Siri without pressing the Home button. Instead, you can bark out the com-
mand, “Hey Siri.”
But sometimes, well — there’s no way to say this kindly — you want Siri to 
shut up. To do that, just turn the Siri setting from on (green) to off. If you 
do disable Siri, be aware that the information she uses to respond to your 
requests is removed from Apple’s servers. So if you call Siri back into duty 
later, it may take a little bit of time for the feature to resend information. 
Don’t fret if you don’t remember any of this. Apple reminds you ahead of your 
silencing Siri.

277
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Other Siri settings to note:
	
✓	Default language: You can choose the language in which she will speak 
to you. The default is U.S. English.
	
✓	Voice gender: You can switch from a female to a male voice or vice 
versa.
	
✓	Voice feedback: You can select whether to always get voice feedback 
from Siri, as opposed to only when you’re in a hands-free situation.
	
✓	Your info: And you can let Siri know who you are by choosing your 
name (if not already shown) in the My Info section of Siri settings. If for 
some reason you want to choose another name, you can do so from your 
list of contacts.
Spotlight Search
Tell the iPad mini the apps that you want to search. Touch the three horizon-
tal lines next to an app that you want to include in your search and drag up 
or down to rearrange the search order.
Handoff and Suggested Apps
	
The Handoff feature, added with iOS 8, lets you start a task (such as typing an 
email) on your iPad mini, on another iOS 8 device, or on a Mac computer run-
ning OS X Yosemite, and resume the task on another iPad, iOS 8 device, or 
Mac. All the devices have to be running the identical iCloud account. On the 
tablet, you’ll be able to resume with the app from your lock screen or app 
switcher. On a Mac, you’ll see the appropriate app on the dock.
In the Suggested Apps section, you can flip on a setting to showcase installed 
apps or App Store suggestions relevant to your current location. Such sugges-
tions appear on the lock screen and in the app switcher.
Accessibility
The Accessibility or Universal Access Features tools on your iPad mini are 
targeted at helping people with certain disabilities. The following sections 
explain many of these options.
VoiceOver
The VoiceOver screen reader describes aloud what’s on the screen. It can 
read email messages, web pages, and more. With VoiceOver active, you tap 
an item on the screen to select it. VoiceOver places a black rectangle around 
the item and either speaks the name or describes an item. For example, if 
you tap Display & Brightness, the VoiceOver voice speaks the words “Display 

278
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
and brightness button.” VoiceOver even lets you know when you position 
the iPad in landscape or portrait mode and when your screen is locked or 
unlocked.
Within the VoiceOver setting, you have several options. For instance, if you 
turn on Speak Hints, VoiceOver may provide instructions on what to do next, 
along the lines of “Double-tap to open.” You can drag a Speaking Rate slider 
to speed up or slow down the speech. You can also determine the kind of 
typing feedback you get: characters, words, characters and words, or no 
feedback. Additional switches let you turn on sound effects, change the pitch, 
and choose the default dialect. For example, you can choose an English dia-
lect common to Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, or South Africa, along 
with, of course, the United States.
	
The voice you hear speaks in the language you specified in Language & 
Region settings, which we explain later.
You have to know a new set of finger gestures when VoiceOver is on, which 
may seem difficult, especially when you first start using VoiceOver. When 
you stop to think about it, this requirement makes a lot of sense because 
you want to be able to hear descriptions on the screen before you activate 
buttons. Different VoiceOver gestures use different numbers of fingers, and 
Apple recommends that you experiment with different techniques to see 
what works best for you. A VoiceOver Practice button is provided for this 
purpose.
Here’s a rundown of many of these gestures:
	
✓	Tap: Speak the item.
	
✓	Swipe right or left: Select the next or previous item.
	
✓	Swipe up or down: This gesture has multiple outcomes that depend 
on how you set the rotor control gesture. To select your options, head 
to Settings➪General➪Accessibility➪VoiceOver➪Rotor. The rotor con-
trol gesture is similar to turning a dial: You rotate two fingertips on the 
screen. The purpose is to switch to a different set of commands or fea-
tures. For example you have flick up or flick down gestures. (A flick is 
a faster swipe.) Suppose you’re reading text in an email. By alternately 
spinning the rotor, you can switch between hearing the body of a mes-
sage read aloud word by word or character by character. After you set 
the parameters, flick up or down to hear stuff read back. When you type 
an email, the flicking up and down gestures serve a different purpose: 
The gestures move the cursor left or right within the text.
	
✓	Two-finger tap: Stop speaking.
	
✓	Two-finger swipe up: Read everything from the top of the screen.
	
✓	Two-finger swipe down: Read everything from your current position on 
the screen.

279
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
	
✓	Three-finger swipe up or down: Scroll a page.
	
✓	Three-finger swipe right or left: Go to the next or previous page, 
respectively.
	
✓	Three-finger tap: Lets you know which page or rows are on the screen.
	
✓	Four-finger flick up or down: Go to the first or last part of the page, 
respectively.
	
✓	Four-finger flick right or left: Go to the next or previous section, 
respectively.
	
✓	Double-tap: Activate a selected icon or button to launch an app, turn a 
switch from on to off, and more.
	
✓	Split tap: For this gesture, you touch an item with one finger and tap the 
screen with another. When you touch an item, a voice identifies what 
you touched (for example, “Safari button” or “Notifications on button”). 
A tap with the second finger selects whatever was identified with the 
first finger (that is, “Safari button selected” or “Notifications on button 
selected”). Now you can double-tap to launch the button or whatever 
else was selected.
	
✓	Double-tap, hold down for a second, and then add a standard gesture: 
Tell the iPad mini to go back to using standard gestures for your next 
move. You can also use standard gestures with VoiceOver by double­
tapping and holding down on the screen. You hear tones that remind 
you that standard gestures are now in effect. They stay that way until 
you lift your finger.
	
✓	Two-finger double-tap: Play or pause. You use the double-tap in the 
Music, YouTube, and Photos apps.
	
✓	Three-finger double-tap: Mute or unmute the voice.
	
✓	Three-finger triple-tap: Turn the display on or off.
Zoom
The Zoom feature offers a screen magnifier for those who are visually chal-
lenged. To zoom by 200 percent, double-tap the screen with three fingers. 
Drag three fingers to move around the screen. To increase magnification, use 
three fingers to tap and drag up. Tap with three fingers and drag down to 
decrease magnification.
The Zoom feature does have a downside: When magnified, the characters on 
the screen aren’t as crisp (although the Retina display is still pretty sharp), 
and you can’t display as much in a single view. You can also choose to zoom 
full screen or zoom only a window. And you can drag a slider to choose your 
maximum zoom level.

280
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Large Type
You can make text larger in the Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Messages, and 
Notes apps. Drag the slider from left to right or from the small A toward 
the larger A. You can turn on a Larger Accessibility Sizes switch to enlarge 
the text even more in certain supported apps. (You may recall the Text Size 
option we mention earlier when describing the Display & Brightness setting.)
Bold Text
Bold Text is another setting you first met in Display & Brightness. Not every-
one took kindly to the design changes brought by iOS 7. Some people didn’t 
think the text was bold or bright enough. If you still feel that way after migrat-
ing to iOS 8, consider turning on the Bold Text switch. As we note earlier, 
doing so (or turning it off again) requires that you restart your iPad.
Button Shapes
Turn the Button Shapes setting on, and the left-pointing arrow at the top-
left corner of the Settings pane (next to General) disappears and the word 
General appears inside a pencil-shaped button.
Increase Contrast
The Increase Contrast setting is another effort to bolster legibility. You can 
reduce the transparency of the screen to improve the contrast on some back-
grounds. You can darken colors. And you can reduce the intensity of bright 
colors. Play around with these options to see whether they make a difference.
Invert Colors
The colors on the iPad mini can be reversed to provide a higher contrast 
for people with poor eyesight. The screen resembles a film negative. (You 
remember film, right?)
Grayscale
	
With the Grayscale setting, an iOS 8 addition, you can eliminate color and 
go gray.
Hearing Aids
The mini can communicate with hearing aids through Bluetooth. And Apple 
has designed a new Bluetooth technology for use with custom iPad hearing 
aids.
Subtitles and Captioning
Aimed at people who are deaf or hard of hearing, the Subtitles and Captioning 
setting lets you turn on a Closed Captions + SDH switch to summon closed-
captioning or subtitles. You can also choose and preview the style for the 
subtitles and create your own subtitle style.

281
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Video Descriptions
Toggling the Video Descriptions switch enables the mini to automatically play 
video descriptions when available.
Mono Audio
If you suffer hearing loss in one ear, the iPad’s Mono Audio setting can com-
bine the right and left audio channels so that both channels can be heard 
in either earbud of any headset you plug in. A slider control can adjust how 
much audio is combined and to which ear it is directed.
	
The iPad mini, unlike its cousins the iPhone and the iPod touch, doesn’t 
come with earbuds or headphones. You have to supply your own.
Speak Selection
When the Speak Selection setting is on, the mini speaks any text you select. 
You also find a slider control to adjust the speaking rate. And you can high-
light words as they are spoken.
Speak Auto-Text
When the Speak Auto-Text setting is on, the mini automatically speaks auto-
corrections and capitalizations.
Reduce Motion
We think the parallax effect of icons and alerts added with iOS 7 (and still 
around in iOS 8) is cool, but your neighbor may not agree. By turning on the 
Reduce Motion switch, you can reduce the parallax effect and be fairly confi-
dent that your wallpaper will remain still.
On/Off Labels
Throughout this book, you read that when certain switches are on, green 
appears. If you turn on the On/Off Labels switch, you’ll still see green, but 
you’ll also see a nerdy 1 when the setting or switch is turned on or a little 0 
when the switch is off.
Guided Access
Parents of autistic kids know how challenging it can be to keep their child 
focused on a given task. The Guided Access setting can limit iPad mini usage 
to a single app and also restrict touch input on certain areas of the screen.
Switch Control
Several controls are represented under the Switch Control setting. The 
general idea is that you can use a single switch or multiple switches to 
select text, tap, drag, type, and perform other functions. However, turning 
on Switch Control changes the gestures you use to control your tablet and 

282
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
are presumably already familiar with. Switch Control makes use of differ-
ent techniques. For example, the iPad can scan by or highlight items on the 
screen until you select one. Or you can choose to take advantage of scanning 
crosshairs to select a location on the screen. You can also manually move 
from item to item by using multiple switches, with each switch set to handle 
a specific action. We recommend poking around this setting to examine these 
and other options.
AssistiveTouch
Turn on the AssistiveTouch setting if you need to use an adaptive accessory, 
such as a joystick, because of difficulties touching the screen. When this set-
ting is on, a movable dot appears; tap the dot to access certain features, such 
as Notification Center or Home. You can also create custom gestures through 
AssistiveTouch.
Home-Click Speed
With the Home-Click Speed setting, you can slow down the speed required 
to double or triple-click the Home button, which is next on the list of 
Accessibility options.
Accessibility Shortcut
Double-clicking the Home button launches multitasking. But you can set up 
the iPad mini so that triple-clicking the button (clicking three times really 
fast) turns on certain accessibility features. (This tool used to be called 
Triple-Click Home.) By doing so, you can turn on or off VoiceOver, Invert 
Colors, Grayscale, Zoom, Switch Control, and AssistiveTouch.
Subtitles & Captioning
To turn on closed captioning or subtitles for a movie or video in which 
they’re available, tap the Subtitles & Captioning setting. You can also choose 
a style for your subtitles.
Multitasking Gestures
Enable the Multitasking Gestures option if you want to use four or five 
­fingers to
	
✓	Pinch to the Home screen.
	
✓	Swipe up to multitask.
	
✓	Swipe left or right to switch among open apps.
	
By all means, enable this option if it isn’t enabled. The gestures improve the 
multitasking experience, and we recommend that you give them a try. If you 
hate them, you know where to go to turn them off.

283
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Usage settings
The About setting (covered earlier) gives you a lot of information about your 
device. But after you back out of About and return to the main General set-
tings, you can find other settings for statistics on iPad usage:
	
✓	Battery: You almost always see a little battery meter in the upper-right 
corner of the screen, except for certain instances, such as when you 
watch videos and the top bar disappears. If you also want to see your 
battery life presented in percentage terms, make sure that the Battery 
Percentage setting is on. You can also see how much usage and standby 
time you’ve consumed since your last full charge. Usage (by percentage 
of battery used) can be displayed by app for the past 24 hours or the 
past 7 days.
	
✓	iCloud: This setting shows the amount of total and available storage. 
Tap Manage Storage to, well, manage your iCloud storage, taking note of 
all your iOS backups. If need be, you can buy more storage. Tap Change 
Storage Plan to get started. You can pay 99¢ a month for 200GB, $3.99 a 
month for 200GB, or $9.99 a month for 500GB. Need a full terabyte each 
month? That’ll set you back $19.99 monthly. You can also downgrade to 
a free 5GB plan.
	
✓	Storage (for the device): Check out which apps on your iPad are hogging 
the most storage and delete those (from here) that you’re no longer using.
Background App Refresh
Some apps continue to run in the background even when you’re not actively 
engaged with them. If you flip the Background App Refresh switch so that 
green is showing, you can allow such apps to update content when an active 
Wi-Fi or cellular connection is available. The potential downside to leaving 
this switch turned on is a hit on battery life.
As it turns out, your iPad is pretty smart about when to refresh apps. iOS 
detects patterns based on how you use your iPad. It learns when your tablet 
is typically inactive — at night perhaps when you’re in slumberland. And in 
some cases, apps are refreshed when you enter a particular location.
You can also turn on or off Background App Refresh for any individual app 
listed under this setting. Flip the switch to make the determination for each 
given app.
Auto-Lock
Tap Auto-Lock in the General settings pane, and you can set the amount of 
time that elapses before the mini automatically locks or turns off the display. 
Your choices are 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or 2 minutes. Or you can 
set it so that the iPad never locks automatically.

284
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
If you work for a company that insists on a passcode (see the next section), 
the Never Auto-Lock option isn’t in the list that your iPad displays.
Don’t worry about whether the iPad is locked. You can still receive notifica-
tion alerts and adjust the volume.
Touch ID & Passcode
If you want to prevent others from using your iPad mini, you can set a pass-
code by tapping Touch ID & Passcode (or just Passcode on models without 
Touch ID) and then tapping Turn Passcode On. By default, you use the virtual 
keypad to enter and confirm a four-digit passcode. If you’d prefer a longer, 
stronger passcode, tap the Simple Passcode switch to turn it off. Now provide 
your current passcode, and then enter and confirm your new passcode, which 
can be almost any combination of the letters, numbers, and symbols available 
on the standard virtual keyboard.
You can also determine whether a passcode is required immediately, after 
1 minute, after 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours. Shorter times are 
more secure, of course. On the topic of security, the iPad mini can be set 
to automatically erase your data if someone makes ten failed passcode 
attempts.
You can also change the passcode or turn it off later (unless your employer 
dictates otherwise), but you need to know the present passcode to apply any 
changes. If you forget the passcode, you have to restore the iPad software, as 
we describe in Chapter 16.
From the Touch ID & Passcode setting, you can determine whether to allow 
access to the today view, the notifications view, or Siri when the mini is 
locked.
If you have an iPad mini 3, we strongly recommend that you at least try 
Touch ID, the clever fingerprint authentication scheme that not only lets you 
bypass the lock screen by pressing your thumb or another finger against 
the Home button, but also lets you purchase stuff in iTunes, the App Store, 
and the iBooks Store. You can also take advantage of the nascent Apple 
Pay mobile payments system but (as of this writing) only for certain online 
transactions — not physical retail stores as is possible with the iPhone 6 and 
iPhone 6 Plus.
You can store up to five fingerprints (yours and people you trust with whom 
you share the iPad). Tap Add a Fingerprint and go through the training ses-
sion that you likely encountered back when you set up your iPad (consult 
Chapter 2 for details). If the iPad doesn’t recognize your finger, you see Try 
Again at the top of the screen. You get three wrong tries before you’re forced 
to use a traditional passcode instead, at least for this session.

285
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
As an added security measure, a regular passcode is required the first time 
you try to get past a lock screen after restarting the tablet.
If you want to delete an authorized fingerprint, tap the listing for the finger in 
question, and then tap Delete Fingerprint. Excuse our French, but you’ve just 
given the finger to the finger.
Twitter
In Twitter settings, you can add a new Twitter account and update your con-
tacts so that Twitter uses their email addresses and phone numbers to auto-
matically add their Twitter handles and photos. You also can choose yay or 
nay on whether you can use various apps with Twitter.
Facebook
Most of us know Facebook as a great service to help us stay in touch with rel-
atives, associates, and old pals, rekindle relationships, and make new friends. 
But some people collect Facebook friends like baseball cards. If it seems like 
you’re acquainted with all 1.3 billion-and-counting members of the mammoth 
social network, we know what you mean.
Fortunately, Apple kindly organizes your Facebook relationships on the iPad 
mini. If you turn on the Calendar and Contacts switches under Facebook 
settings on the iPad, your Facebook friends automatically populate your 
contacts list, complete with profile pictures as well as email addresses and 
phone numbers (if they made them public on Facebook). Birthdays and cal-
endar appointments appropriately turn up in the Calendar app.
Think of these Facebook entries as live synced contact entries. If a person 
changes his or her phone number and email address on Facebook, that change 
will be reflected on your mini, provided you have Wi-Fi or cellular coverage or 
the next time you do have coverage. And if your friends de-friend you — how 
cruel is that? — their contact info will disappear.
If the iPad can correctly match a Facebook friend entry with an existing con-
tact entry, it will try to unify that contact under a single view. The Update All 
Contacts option under Facebook settings on the iPad serves a slightly differ-
ent purpose. It tries to add Facebook profile information to contacts who are 
on Facebook but are not among your Facebook friends.
Sorting and displaying contacts
Do you think of us as Ed and Bob or Baig and LeVitus? The answer to that 
question will probably determine whether you choose to sort your contacts 
list alphabetically by last name or first name.

286
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; scroll down to the Contacts section; and peek 
at Sort Order. Then tap Last, First or First, Last. You can determine whether 
you want to display a first name or last name first by tapping Display Order 
and then choosing First, Last or Last, First. You can also go with a short name 
to fit more names on the screen. You can choose a first name and last initial, 
first initial and last name, first name only, or last name only. If you prefer nick-
names, you can choose those instead, when available.
	
Meanwhile, tap Show in App Switcher so that when you double-click the 
Home button, you can quickly access your tablet favorites and the recent 
people you’ve been schmoozing with (via phone calls and other conversa-
tions). We think Show in App Switcher is a terrific iOS 8 addition.
In My Info, make sure your own name is chosen so that Siri knows where you 
live, among other reasons.
Restrictions
Parents and bosses may love the Restrictions tools, but kids and employees 
usually think otherwise. You can clamp down, er, provide proper parental 
guidance to your children or managerial guidance to your staff by prevent-
ing them (at least some of the time) from using the Safari browser, Camera, 
FaceTime, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, Siri, AirDrop, or Game Center. Or 
you might not let them install new apps or make purchases inside the apps 
you do allow — or (conversely) let them delete apps. When restrictions 
are in place, icons for off-limit functions can no longer be seen. Tap Enable 
Restrictions, set or enter your passcode — you have to enter it twice if you 
are setting up the passcode — and tap the switch next to each item in the 
Allow or Allowed Content lists that you plan to restrict. Their corresponding 
settings should be off (gray is showing rather than green).
You can also restrict the use of explicit language when you dictate text. An 
asterisk (*) replaces a naughty word.
Moreover, parents have more controls to work with. For instance, you can 
allow Junior to watch a movie on the mini but prevent him from watching a 
flick that carries an R or NC-17 rating. You can also restrict access to certain 
TV shows, explicit songs and podcasts, and apps based on age-appropriate 
ratings. In Game Center, you can decide whether your kid can play a multi-
player game or add friends. Apple lets you choose whether to let the kids 
read books with explicit sexual content. You can also restrict access to web-
sites that have adult content.
Stop feeling guilty: You have your users’ best interests at heart.
If guilt gets the better of you, you can turn off restrictions. Open the 
Restrictions setting by again typing your passcode. Then switch the setting 
on for each item you are freeing up. Tap Disable Restrictions. You have to 

287
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
enter your passcode one more time before your kids and office underlings 
return you to their good graces.
Under Restrictions settings, you’ll find privacy controls as well. For example, 
you can impose restrictions on the use of Location Services, as well as 
Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos, Bluetooth sharing, and more. (For 
these and additional privacy controls, visit the dedicated Privacy setting.)
And in this area, you can allow or restrict changes made to your accounts, 
Find My Friends, cellular use, background app refreshes, even volume limits.
There’s a lot here, and even if you’re liberal about policing your kids’ activi-
ties, we recommend you poke around and consider all your options.
Promoting harmony through Family Sharing
	
We just explained how to impose an iron fist when it comes to permitting 
iPad mini usage at home. Now we’re going to try and make everybody in the 
clan happy again. Visit iCloud settings and consider setting up Family Sharing 
with up to six members of your family. Adults and kids can partake, but one 
grown-up must take charge as the family organizer. We figure it might as well 
be you, the person reading this book. You’ll be the person presenting your 
iCloud Apple ID username and password, and the one on the hook for paying 
for iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases. As the family organizer, you can 
turn on Ask to Buy so that you can approve (or deny) purchases or download 
requests from other members of your clan.
When Family Sharing has been implemented, you can all share a calendar, 
photos, reminders, and your respective locations. Family Sharing may also 
help find a missing device through the important Find My iPad feature, which 
we describe at the end of this chapter.
	
Should you leave Family Sharing, your account is removed from the group 
and you can no longer share content with everybody else. You won’t be able 
to use DRM-protected music, movies, TV shows, books, or apps that another 
member purchased. And you won’t be able to access the family calendar, 
reminders, or photos.
Family Sharing works with iOS 8 devices, OS X Yosemite on a Mac, and Find 
My Friends 3.0, Find My iPhone 3.1, and iCloud for Windows 4.0.
Cover Lock/Unlock
Use the Cover Lock/Unlock setting to automatically lock and unlock your 
iPad mini when you close and open the clever iPad smart cover, Apple’s 
smart case, or some other covers. If you set a passcode, you still have to 
enter it to wake the iPad from siesta-land.

288
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Side Switch
You can use the side switch for one of two purposes: You can lock the rota-
tion so that the screen orientation doesn’t change when you turn the iPad 
mini to the side, or you can mute certain sounds. You get to make that choice 
through the Side Switch setting.
Date & Time
In our neck of the woods, the time is reported as 11:32 p.m. (or whatever time 
it happens to be). But in some circles, it’s reported as 23:32. If you prefer the 
latter format on the iPad’s status bar, tap the 24-Hour Time setting (under 
Date & Time) so that it’s on (green).
This setting is just one that you can adjust under Date & Time. You can also 
have the iPad set the time in your time zone. Here’s how:
	
1.	Tap Date & Time.
	
	 You see fields for setting the time zone and the date and time.
	
2.	Tap the Time Zone field and make sure Set Automatically is turned off.
	
	 The current time zone and virtual keyboard are shown.
	
3.	Tap X to remove the city currently shown in the Time Zone field, and 
tap the letters of the city or country whose time zone you want to 
enter until the one you have in mind appears. Then tap the name of 
that city or country.
	
	 The Time Zone field is automatically filled in for that city.
	
4.	Tap the Set Date & Time field so that the time is shown; then roll the 
carousel controls until the proper time displays.
	
5.	Roll the carousel controls to choose the proper month, day, and year 
until the correct date appears.
	
6.	Tap General to return to the main Date & Time settings screen.
You can also dispense with these settings and just have the iPad mini set the 
time automatically, based on its knowledge of where you happen to be. Just 
make sure to turn on the Set Automatically option.
Keyboard
Under Keyboard settings, you have the following options:
	
✓	Auto-Capitalization: Automatically capitalize the first letter of the first 
word you type after ending the preceding sentence with a period, a 
question mark, or an exclamation point. Auto-capitalization is on by 
default.

289
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
	
✓	Auto-Correction: The iPad takes a stab at what it thinks you meant to 
type.
	
✓	Check Spelling: The keyboard checks spelling while you type.
	
✓	Enable Caps Lock: All letters are uppercased LIKE THIS if you double-
tap the shift key. (The shift key is the one with the arrow pointing up.) 
Tap shift again to exit caps lock.
	
✓	“.” Shortcut: A period is inserted followed by a space when you double-
tap the space bar. This setting is turned on by default; if you’ve never 
tried it, give it a shot.
	
	A little lower down under Keyboard settings, you’ll see another type of 
shortcut option: having the keyboard type a full phrase when you type a 
few letters. For example, typing the letters omw yields On my way! Tap 
Add New Shortcut to do just that, and then enter the phrase and the 
shortcut that will lead to that phrase. Saving a few letters is economical, 
don’t you think?
You can choose to use an international keyboard (as we discuss in 
Chapter 2), which you enable from Keyboard settings.
	
With iOS 8, Apple gives you the power to substitute the default keyboard on 
your iPad mini for a custom alternative. Among the choices that you might 
consider are Swype, SwiftKey, Fleksy, and Adaptxt. For more on adding a 
third-party keyboard, consult Chapter 2.
Language & Region
The iPad is an international sensation. In the Language & Region section, you 
can set the language in which the mini displays text, plus the date and time 
format for the region in question. You can choose a Gregorian, Japanese, or 
Buddhist calendar, too.
iTunes Wi-Fi Sync
We spend an entire chapter (Chapter 3, to be precise) on syncing. Just know 
that if you want to sync with iTunes on your computer when you’re plugged 
into power and tapped into Wi-Fi, you can do it here.
VPN settings
After you tap VPN on the General settings screen, you see a control for VPN.
	
A virtual private network, or VPN, is a way for you to securely access your 
company’s network behind the firewall — using an encrypted Internet con-
nection that acts as a secure tunnel for data.

290
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
You can configure a VPN on the iPad mini by following these steps:
	
1.	Tap Settings➪General➪VPN➪Add VPN Configuration.
	
2.	Tap one of the protocol options.
	
	 The iPad software supports the protocols L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling 
Protocol), PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), and IPSec, 
which apparently provides the kind of security that satisfies network 
administrators.
	
3.	Using configuration settings provided by your company, fill in the 
appropriate server information, account, password, and other 
information.
	
4.	Choose whether to turn on RSA SecurID authentication.
	
	 Better yet, lend your iPad to the techies where you work and let them fill 
in the blanks on your behalf.
After you configure your mini for VPN usage, you can turn that capability on 
or off by tapping (yep) the VPN switch in Settings.
Reset
As little kids playing sports, we ended an argument by agreeing to a do-over. 
Well, the Reset settings on the iPad mini are one big do-over. Now that you’re 
(presumably) grown up, think long and hard about the consequences before 
implementing do-over settings. Regardless, you may encounter good reasons 
for starting over; some of these are addressed in Chapter 16.
Here are your reset options:
	
✓	Reset All Settings: Resets all settings, but no data or media is deleted.
	
✓	Erase All Content and Settings: Resets all settings and wipes out all 
your data.
	
✓	Reset Network Settings: Deletes the current network settings and 
restores them to their factory defaults.
	
✓	Subscriber Services: Reprovisions (or refreshes) your account and 
resets your authentication code.
	
✓	Reset Keyboard Dictionary: Removes added words from the dictionary. 
Remember that the iPad keyboard is intelligent. One reason why it’s so 
smart is that it learns from you. So when you reject words that the iPad 
keyboard suggests, it figures that the words you specifically banged out 
ought to be added to the keyboard dictionary.
	
✓	Reset Home Screen Layout: Reverts all icons to the way they were at 
the factory.
	
✓	Reset Location & Privacy: Restores factory defaults.

 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Find My iPad
We hope you never have to use the Find My iPad feature — though we have 
to say that it’s darn cool. If you inadvertently leave your iPad mini in a taxi or 
restaurant, Find My iPad may just help you retrieve it. All you need is a free 
iCloud account.
Well, that’s almost all you need. You’ll have to turn on your account, so tap 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then tap your iCloud account. Or tap 
Settings➪iCloud. Either way, make sure Find My iPad is switched on.
Now, suppose you lost your tablet — and we can only assume that you’re 
beside yourself. Follow these steps to see whether the Find My iPad feature 
can help you:
	
1.	Log on to your iCloud account at https://www.icloud.com from 
any browser on your computer.
	
2.	Click the Find My iPhone icon.
	
	 If you don’t see it, click the icon with a cloud in it that appears in the upper-
left corner of the iCloud site. You see a panel with icons that are tied to 
various iCloud services, including Find My iPhone. (Yes, even though the 
feature is Find My iPad on the iPad, it shows up as Find My iPhone on the 
iCloud site. Don’t worry; it’ll still locate your iPad mini — and, for that 
matter, a lost iPhone or iPod touch, and even a Mac computer too.)
	
	 Assuming that your tablet is turned on and in the coverage area, its gen-
eral whereabouts turn up on a map (as shown in Figure 15-10) in stan-
dard or satellite view, or a hybrid of the two. In our tests, Find My iPad 
found our iPads quickly.
Figure 15-10: Locate a lost iPad.

292
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
	 Even seeing your iPad mini on a map may not help you much, especially 
if the device is lost somewhere in midtown Manhattan. Take heart.
	
3.	At the iCloud site, click the Lost Mode button.
	
4.	Type a phone number at which you can be reached, as well as a plea 
to the Good Samaritan who (you hope) picked up your iPad.
	
	 Apple has already prepared a simple message indicating that the iPad 
is lost, but you can change or remove the message and substitute your 
own plea for the return of your tablet.
	
	 The message 
appears on the 
lost iPad’s screen, 
as shown in 
Figure 15-11.
	
	 To get someone’s 
attention, you 
can also sound an 
alarm that plays 
for two minutes, 
even if the volume 
is off. Tap Play 
Sound to make it 
happen. Hey, that 
alarm may come in 
handy if the mini 
turns up under a 
couch in your 
house. Stranger things have happened.
	
We also recommend turning on the Send Last Location setting in Find My 
iPad because it automatically sends the tablet’s location to Apple when the 
device’s battery is critically low. That way, you still have a puncher’s chance 
of getting back a lost iPad even when the battery is knocked out.
	
Find My iPhone (which finds any iOS device) is now available as a free app in 
the App Store. Another free app called Find My Friends will locate your 
friends on a map. Just hope that when you find a particular pal, he or she is 
not the one who snatched your missing iPad.
After all this labor, if the mini is seemingly gone for good, click Erase iPad 
at the iCloud site to delete your personal data from afar and return the iPad 
to its factory settings. (A somewhat less drastic measure is to remotely lock 
your iPad by using a four-digit passcode.)
Figure 15-11: An appeal to return the iPad.

293
 Chapter 15: Setting You Straight on Settings
Meanwhile, the person who found (or possibly stole) your iPad cannot reac-
tivate the device to use as his or her own, or to peddle, unless he or she suc-
cessfully types in your Apple ID.
Even if you choose to erase the device remotely, it can still display a custom 
message with the information needed for someone to return it to you. If, 
indeed, you ever get your iPad mini back, you can always restore the informa-
tion from an iTunes backup on your Mac or PC or iCloud.
We authors are always seeking a happy ending.

n our experience, all Apple iOS devices — namely the iPad, iPhone, and 
iPod touch — are fairly reliable. But every so often, a good iPad mini 
might just go bad. We don’t expect it to be a common occurrence, but it does 
happen occasionally. So, in this chapter, we look at the types of bad 
things that can happen, along with suggestions for fixing them.
What kind of bad things are we talking about? Well, we’re 
referring to problems involving
	
✓	Frozen or dead iPad minis
	
✓	Wireless networks
	
✓	Synchronization of computers (both Mac and 
PC) or iTunes
After all the troubleshooting, we tell you how to get 
even more help if nothing we suggest does the trick. 
Finally, if your iPad is so badly hosed that it needs to 
go back to the mother ship for repairs, we offer ways to 
survive the experience with a minimum of stress or fuss, 
including how to restore your stuff from an iTunes or iCloud 
backup.

296
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Resuscitating an iPad mini with Issues
Our first category of troubleshooting techniques applies to an iPad mini 
that’s frozen or otherwise acting up. The recommended procedure when this 
happens is to perform the seven Rs in sequence.
	
1.	Recharge
	
2.	Restart
	
3.	Reset your iPad mini
	
4.	Remove your content
	
5.	Reset settings and content
	
6.	Restore
	
7.	Recovery mode
But before you even start those procedures, Apple recommends you take 
these steps:
	
1.	Verify that you have the current version of iTunes installed on your 
Mac or PC.
	
	 You can download the latest and greatest version here: www.apple.
com/itunes/download.
	
2.	Verify that you’re connecting your iPad mini to your computer using a 
USB 2.0 or 3.0 port.
	
	 If you encounter difficulties here, we implore you to read the paragraph 
in the next section that begins with this:
	
	“Don’t plug the iPad mini’s Lightning–to–USB cable into a USB port 
on your keyboard, monitor, or unpowered USB hub.”
	
3.	Make sure that your iPad mini software is up to date.
	
	 To check with iTunes on your Mac or PC: 
	
a.	Connect the iPad to the computer, and then click the iPad icon in the 
row of icons below the toolbar.
	
	If you connect more than one iDevice to this computer simultane-
ously, the button will say the number of devices (for example, 5 
Devices) rather than iPad. Click the button to display a drop-down 
list and select the device you want.
	
b.	Click the Summary tab and then click the Check for Update button.

297
 Chapter 16: When Good iPad minis Go Bad
	
	 To check with your iPad mini: 
	
a.	On the Home screen, tap Settings.
	
b.	In the Settings list on the left side of the screen, tap General.
	
c.	On the right side of the screen, tap Software Update.
	
	 If your iPad requires an update, you receive instructions for doing so. 
Otherwise, please continue.
If those three easy steps didn’t get you back up and running and your iPad is 
still acting up — if it freezes, doesn’t wake up from sleep, doesn’t do some-
thing it used to do, or in any other way acts improperly — don’t panic. The 
following sections describe the things you should try, in the order that we 
(and Apple) recommend.
If the first technique doesn’t do the trick, go on to the second. If the second 
one doesn’t work, try the third. And so on.
Recharge
If your iPad mini acts up in any way, shape, or form, the first thing you should 
try is to give its battery a full recharge before you proceed.
	
Don’t plug the iPad mini’s Lightning–to–USB cable into a USB port on your 
keyboard, monitor, or an unpowered USB hub. You must plug the cable into 
one of the USB ports on your computer itself because the USB ports on your 
computer supply more power than the other ports. Although other USB ports 
may do the trick, you’re better off using a built-in one on your computer.
If your computer is more than a few years old, even your built-in USB ports 
may not supply enough juice to recharge your iPad. It’ll sync just fine; it just 
won’t recharge. If you see Not Charging next to the battery icon at the top of 
the screen, use the included USB power adapter to recharge your iPad from 
an AC outlet rather than from a computer.
	
Most powered USB hubs, the kind you plug into an AC outlet, will charge your 
iPad mini just fine. But passive or unpowered hubs — ones that don’t plug 
into the wall for power — won’t cut it when it comes to charging your iPad.
	
If you’re in a hurry, charge your iPad for a minimum of 20 minutes. We think a 
full charge is a better idea, but a charge of 20 is better than no charge at all. 
And for faster charging in any circumstances, turn off your iPad while it 
charges, or put it in airplane mode at the very least.

298
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Restart
If you recharge your iPad mini and it still misbehaves, the next thing to try 
is restarting it. Just as restarting a computer often fixes problems, restarting 
your iPad sometimes works wonders.
Here’s how to restart your iPad mini:
	
1.	Hold down the sleep/wake button.
	
2.	When the red slider appears, slide it to turn off the iPad and then wait 
a few seconds.
	
3.	Hold down the sleep/wake button again until the Apple logo appears 
on the screen.
	
4.	If your iPad is still frozen, misbehaves, or doesn’t start, hold down the 
Home button for six to ten seconds to force any frozen applications to 
quit.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1–3 again.
	
If your Home or sleep/wake button is acting up and you can’t power down the 
usual way, try enabling Assistive Touch in Settings➪General➪Accessibility. A 
gray circle will appear on your screen; tap it and several options including 
on-screen versions of the Home and sleep/wake buttons appear. It may not 
help but it might.
If these steps don’t get your iPad back up and running, move on to the third 
R: resetting your iPad.
Reset your iPad mini
To reset your iPad mini, merely hold down the sleep/wake button and then 
hold down the Home button, continuing to keep both buttons down for at 
least ten seconds. When you see the Apple logo, release both buttons.
Resetting your iPad is like forcing your computer to restart after a crash. 
Your data shouldn’t be affected by a reset — and in many cases, the reset 
cures whatever was ailing your iPad. So don’t be shy about giving this tech-
nique a try. In many cases, your iPad goes back to normal after you reset it 
this way.
	
Sometimes you have to hold down the sleep/wake button before you hold 
down the Home button. If you press both at the same time, you might create 
a screen shot — a picture of whatever is on your screen at the time — rather 
than reset your iPad.
Unfortunately, sometimes resetting doesn’t do the trick. When that’s the case, 
you have to take stronger measures.

299
 Chapter 16: When Good iPad minis Go Bad
	
At this point, it’s a good idea to back up your iPad’s contents. On your iPad 
mini, go to Settings➪iCloud➪Storage & Backup and tap the Back Up Now 
button. Or connect your iPad to your computer and look in the Backup sec-
tion of the Summary pane in iTunes, which also identifies when the last 
backup occurred.
Remove content
Nothing you’ve tried so far should have taken more than a few minutes (or 20 
if you tried the 20-minute recharge). We hate to tell you, but that’s about to 
change because the next thing you should try is removing some or all of your 
data to see whether it’s causing your troubles.
To do so, you need to sync your iPad and then reconfigure it so that some or 
all of your files are not synchronized (which removes them from the iPad). 
The problem could be contacts, calendar data, songs, photos, videos, or pod-
casts. You can apply one of two strategies to this troubleshooting task:
	
✓	If you suspect a particular data type — for example, you suspect your 
photos because your iPad freezes whenever you tap the Photos icon on 
the Home screen — try removing that data first.
	
✓	If you have no suspicions, deselect every item and then sync. When 
you’re finished, your iPad should have no data on it. If that method fixes 
your iPad, try restoring your data, one type at a time. If the problem 
returns, you have to keep experimenting to determine which particular 
data type or file is causing the problem.
If you’re still having problems, the next step is to reset your iPad’s settings 
and content.
Reset settings and content
Resetting involves two steps: The first one, resetting your iPad settings, 
resets every iPad setting to its default — the way the iPad was when you took 
it out of the box. Resetting the iPad’s settings doesn’t erase any of your data 
or media, so you can try this step without trepidation. The only downside 
is that you may have to go back and change some settings afterward. To 
reset your settings, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap 
General➪Reset➪Reset All Settings.
	
Be careful not to tap Erase All Content and Settings, at least not yet. Erasing 
all content takes more time to recover from (because your next sync takes a 
long time), so try Reset All Settings first.
Now, if resetting all settings didn’t cure your iPad, you have to try Erase 
All Content and Settings. Read the next warning paragraph first. Then tap 
Settings➪General➪Reset➪Erase All Content and Settings.

300
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
The Erase All Content strategy deletes everything from your iPad — all 
your data, media, and settings. Because all these items are stored on your 
computer — at least in theory — you should be able to put things back the 
way they were during your next sync. But you lose any photos or screen 
shots you’ve taken, as well as email, contacts, calendar events, playlists, and 
anything else you’ve created or modified on the iPad since your last sync.
After using Erase All Content and Settings, check to see whether your iPad 
works properly. If it doesn’t cure what ails your iPad, the next-to-the-last R, 
restoring your iPad using iTunes, can help.
Restore
Before you give up on your poor, sick iPad mini, you can restore it. To 
restore, connect your iPad to your computer as though you were about to 
sync. But when the iPad icon appears in iTunes, click the Summary tab and 
then click the Restore button. This action erases all your data and media and 
resets all your settings.
	
If your computer isn’t available, you can also trigger this step from your iPad 
by tapping Settings➪General➪Reset➪Erase All Content and Settings.
	
Because all your data and media still exist on your computer (except for 
photos or screen shots you’ve taken, as well as email, contacts, calendar 
events, playlists, and anything else you’ve created or modified on the iPad 
since your last sync, as noted previously), you shouldn’t lose anything by 
restoring except possibly email or text messages sent or received since your 
last backup. Your next sync will take longer than usual, and you may have to 
reset settings you’ve changed since you got your iPad. But other than those 
inconveniences, restoring shouldn’t cause you any additional trouble.
	
Performing a restore deletes everything on your iPad — all your data, media, 
and settings. You should be able to put things back the way they were with 
your next sync; if that doesn’t happen, for whatever reason, you can’t say we 
didn’t warn you. That said, you may still be able to restore from an iTunes or 
iCloud backup as described in this chapter’s thrilling conclusion, a scintillat-
ing section we call, “Dude, Where’s My Stuff?”
Recovery mode
So, if you’ve tried all the other steps or you couldn’t try some or all of them 
because your iPad is so messed up, you can try one last thing: Recovery 
mode. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	Disconnect the USB cable from your iPad mini, but leave the other 
end of the cable connected to the USB port on your computer.

301
 Chapter 16: When Good iPad minis Go Bad
	
2.	Turn off the iPad by holding down the sleep/wake button for a few sec-
onds until the red slider appears on-screen, and then slide the slider.
	
	 Wait for the iPad to turn off.
	
3.	Hold down the Home button while you reconnect the USB cable to 
your iPad.
	
	 When you reconnect the USB cable, your iPad should power on.
	
	
	 If you see a battery icon like the one shown in the margin, you need to let 
your iPad charge for at least 10 to 15 minutes. When the battery picture 
goes away or turns green instead of red, go back to Step 2 and try again.
	
4.	Continue holding down the Home button until you see the Connect to 
iTunes screen, and then release the button.
	
	 If you don’t see the Connect to iTunes screen on your iPad, try Steps 1–4 
again.
	
	 If iTunes didn’t open automatically already, launch it now. You should 
see a Recovery mode alert on your computer screen telling you that 
your iPad is in Recovery mode and that you must restore it before it can 
be used with iTunes.
	
5.	Use iTunes to restore the device, as we describe in the preceding 
section.
Okay. So that’s the gamut of things you can do when your iPad mini acts up. If 
you tried all this and none of it worked, skim through the rest of this chapter 
to see whether anything else we recommend looks like it might help. If not, 
your iPad probably needs to go into the shop for repairs.
	
Never fear, gentle reader. Be sure to read the “If Nothing We Suggest Helps” 
section, later in this chapter. Your iPad may be quite sick, but we help ease 
the pain by sharing some tips on how to minimize the discomfort.
Problems with Networks
If you’re having problems with Wi-Fi or your wireless carrier’s data network 
(Wi-Fi + 3G or 4G models only), this section may help. The techniques here 
are short and sweet — except for the last one, restore. Restore, which we 
describe in a previous section, is inconvenient and time-consuming, and 
entails erasing all your data and media and then restoring it.
First, here are some simple steps that may help:
	
✓	Make sure that you have sufficient Wi-Fi or 3G or 4G signal strength, 
as shown in Figure 16-1.

302
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Figure 16-1: Wi-Fi (top) and 3G or 4G (bottom) signal strength from best (left) to  
worst (right).
	
✓	Try moving around. Changing your location by as little as a few feet can 
sometimes mean the difference between great wireless reception and 
no wireless reception. If you’re inside, try moving around even a step 
or two in one direction. If you’re outside, try moving 10 or 20 paces in 
any direction. Keep an eye on the cell signal or Wi-Fi icon as you move 
around, and stop when you see more bars than you saw before.
	
✓	Restart your iPad mini. If you’ve forgotten how, refer to the “Restart” 
section, earlier in this chapter. As we mention, restarting your iPad is 
often all it takes to fix whatever is wrong.
If you have a Wi-Fi + 3G or 4G iPad mini, try the following:
	
✓	Make sure that you haven’t left your iPad in airplane mode, as we 
describe in Chapter 15. In airplane mode, all network-dependent fea-
tures are disabled, so you can’t send or receive messages or use any of 
the apps that require a Wi-Fi or data-network connection (that is, Mail, 
Safari, Maps, and the iTunes and App Store apps).
	
	
✓	Toggle airplane mode on and off. Turn on airplane mode by swiping 
upward from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center and 
then tapping the airplane icon. Wait 15 or 20 seconds and then tap the 
airplane icon again to turn airplane mode off.
	
	Toggling airplane mode on and off like this resets both the Wi-Fi and 
wireless data-network connections. If your network connection was the 
problem, toggling airplane mode on and off may correct it.
	
Apple offers two good articles that may help you with Wi-Fi issues. The first 
offers some general troubleshooting tips and hints; the second discusses 
potential sources of interference for wireless devices and networks. You can 
find them here:
http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3237
and here:
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1365

303
 Chapter 16: When Good iPad minis Go Bad
If none of these suggestions fix your network issues, try restoring your iPad 
mini, as we describe previously in the “Restore” section.
	
Performing a restore deletes everything on your iPad mini — all your data, 
media, and settings. You should be able to put things back the way they were 
with your next sync. If that doesn’t happen, well, consider yourself forewarned.
Sync, Computer, or iTunes Issues
The last category of troubleshooting techniques in this chapter applies to 
issues that involve synchronization and computer-iPad relations. If you’re 
having problems syncing or your computer doesn’t recognize your iPad mini 
when you connect it, here are some things to try.
We suggest that you try these procedures in the order they’re presented here:
	
1.	Recharge your iPad mini.
	
	 If you didn’t try it previously, try it now. Go to the “Resuscitating an iPad 
with Issues” section, earlier in this chapter, and read what we say about 
recharging your iPad. Every word there also applies here.
	
2.	Try a different USB port or a different cable if you have one available.
	
	 It doesn’t happen often, but occasionally USB ports and cables go bad. 
When they do, they invariably cause sync and connection problems. 
Always make sure that a bad USB port or cable isn’t to blame.
	
	 If you don’t remember what we said about using USB ports on your com-
puter rather than the ones on your keyboard, monitor, or hub, we sug-
gest that you reread the “Recharge” section, earlier in this chapter.
	
3.	Restart your iPad and try to sync again.
	
	 We describe restarting in full and loving detail in the “Restart” section, 
earlier in this chapter.
	
4.	Reinstall iTunes.
	
Even if you have an iTunes installer handy, you probably should visit the 
Apple website and download the latest-and-greatest version, just in case. You 
can find the latest version of iTunes at www.apple.com/itunes/download.
More Help on the Apple Website
If you try everything we suggest earlier in this chapter and still have prob-
lems, don’t give up just yet. This section describes a few more places you 
may find help. We recommend that you check them out before you throw in

the towel and smash your iPad into tiny little pieces (or ship it back to Apple 
for repairs, as we describe in the next section).
First, Apple offers an excellent set of support resources on its website at 
www.apple.com/support/ipad/getstarted. You can browse support 
issues by category, search for a problem by keyword, read or download tech-
nical manuals, and scan the discussion forums.
Speaking of the discussion forums, you can go directly to them at http://
discussions.apple.com. They’re chock-full of useful questions and 
answers from other iPad users. If you can’t find an answer to a support ques-
tion elsewhere, you can often find it in these forums. You can browse by cat-
egory or search by keyword. Either way, you find thousands of discussions 
about almost every aspect of using your iPad.
Now for the best part: If you can’t find a solution by browsing or searching, you 
can post your question in the appropriate Apple discussion forum. Check back 
in a few days (or even in a few hours), and some helpful iPad user may well 
have replied with the solution. If you’ve never tried this fabulous tool, you’re 
missing out on one of the greatest support resources available anywhere.
Last, but certainly not least, you might want to try a carefully worded Google 
search. You might just find the solution.
If Nothing We Suggest Helps
If you tried every trick in the book (this one) and still have a malfunction-
ing iPad mini, consider shipping it off to the iPad hospital (better known as 
Apple, Inc.). The repair is free if your iPad is still under its one-year limited 
warranty.
	
You can extend your warranty for as long as two years from the original pur-
chase date, if you want. To do so, you need to buy the AppleCare Protection 
Plan for your iPad. You don’t have to do it when you buy your iPad, but you 
must buy it before your one-year limited warranty expires. The retail price is 
$79, but we’ve seen it for a lot less, so it might pay to shop around.
Here are a few things you need to know before you take your iPad in to be 
repaired:
	
✓	Your iPad mini may be erased during its repair, so you should sync your 
iPad with iTunes before you take it in, if you can. If you can’t and you 
entered data on the iPad since your last sync, such as a contact or an 
appointment, the data may not be there when you restore your iPad 
upon its return.
	
✓	Remove any accessories, such as a case or screen protector.

305
 Chapter 16: When Good iPad minis Go Bad
	
Although you may be able to get your iPad mini serviced by Best Buy or 
another authorized Apple reseller, we recommend that you take or ship it to 
your nearest Apple Store, for two reasons:
	
✓	No one knows your iPad mini like Apple. One of the Geniuses at the 
Apple Store may be able to fix whatever is wrong without sending your 
iPad away for repairs.
	
✓	The Apple Store will, in some cases, swap out your wonky iPad 
mini for a brand-new one on the spot. You can’t win if you don’t play, 
which is why we always visit our local Apple Store when something 
goes wrong (with our iPads, iPhones, iPods, and even our laptops and 
iMacs).
If you’ve done everything we’ve suggested, we’re relatively certain that 
you’re now holding an iPad mini that works flawlessly. Again.
That said, some or all of your stuff may not be on it. If that’s the case, the fol-
lowing section offers a two-trick solution that usually works.
Dude, Where’s My Stuff?
If you performed a restore or had your iPad mini replaced or repaired, you 
have one more task to accomplish. Your iPad may work flawlessly at this 
point, but some or all of your stuff — your music, movies, contacts, iMes-
sages, or whatever — is missing. You’re not sunk, at least not yet. You still 
have a couple of tricks up your sleeve.
	
✓	Trick 1: Sync your iPad mini 
with iTunes and then sync 
it again. That’s right — sync 
and sync again. Why? Because 
sometimes stuff doesn’t get 
synced properly on the first try. 
Just do it.
	
✓	Trick 2: Restore from backup. 
Click the Summary tab in iTunes 
and then click Restore Backup. 
The Restore from Backup dia­
log appears and offers you a 
choice of backups, as shown in 
Figure 16-2. Select the one you 
want, click the Restore button, 
and let the iPad work some 
magic.
Figure 16-2: Select the appropriate backup and 
click the Restore button.

306
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
If you have more than one backup for a device, as Bob has for his devices in 
Figure 16-2, try the most recent (undated) one first. If it doesn’t work or 
you’re still missing files, try restoring from any other backups before you 
throw in the towel.
These backups include photos in camera roll, text messages, notes, contact 
favorites, sound settings, and more, but not media you’ve synced, such as 
music, videos, or photos. If media is missing, try performing Trick 1 again.
If you aren’t holding an iPad mini that works flawlessly and has most (if not 
all) of your stuff, it’s time to make an appointment with a Genius at your local 
Apple Store, call the support hotline (800-275-2273), or visit the support web 
page at www.apple.com/support/ipad.

A
 
nyone who has purchased a new car in recent years is aware that it’s 
not always a picnic trying to escape the showroom without the sales-
person trying to get you to part with a few extra bucks. You can only imagine 
what the markup is on roof racks, navigation systems, and rear-seat DVD 
players.
We don’t suppose you’ll get a hard sell when you snap 
up a new iPad mini at an Apple Store (or elsewhere). 
But Apple and several other companies are all too 
happy to outfit whichever iPad mini model you 
choose with extra doodads, from wireless key-
boards and stands to battery chargers and carrying 
cases. So just as your car might benefit from dealer 
(or third-party) options, so too might your iPad 
mini benefit from a variety of spare parts.
The first-generation iPad mini used the 30-pin dock 
connector. If you own one, you also know that a bevy of 
accessories fit perfectly into that dock connector. Heck, you might even try 
to plug the battery chargers or other iPod or iPhone accessories you have 
lying around into the iPad mini. No guarantee that these will work, but they 
probably will. And you have nothing to lose by trying.

308
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
iPads before 2012 used a 30-pin dock connector. Then, Apple switched to 
a new connector — the Lightning connector — which is what your iPad 
mini has. Since then, accessories compatible with the new connector have 
become ubiquitous but plenty of accessories use the older dock connector. 
Just remember to look for iPad accessories with a Lightning connector.
	
Apple and others sell dock connector–to–Lightning cables and adapters, so 
you can usually use older accessories with your Lightning-connector-
equipped iPad mini.
	
One thing is certain: If you see a Made for iPad label on the package, the 
developer is certifying that an electronic accessory has been designed to 
connect specifically to the iPad and meets performance standards estab-
lished by Apple. Just make sure that the connector matches the specific iPad 
model you have or that you have an available adapter. Note that not all 
adapters support video.
We start this accessories chapter with the options that carry the Apple logo 
and conclude with worthwhile extras from other companies.
Accessories from Apple
You’ve come to expect a certain level of excellence from Apple hardware and 
software, so you should expect no differently when it comes to various Apple-
branded accessories. That said, you can find a variety of opinions on some 
of these products, so we recommend a visit to http://store.apple.com, 
where you can read mini-reviews and pore over ratings from real people just 
like you. They’re not shy about telling it like it is.
Casing the iPad
The thing about accessories is that half the time, you wish they weren’t 
accessories at all. You wish they came in the box. Among the things we would 
have liked to see included with the iPad was a protective case.
Alas, it wasn’t to be. No iPad has ever shipped with a case in the box, but you 
can find cases aplenty just the same. All you need is cash. You read about 
Apple’s here and other cases later in this chapter.
Apple makes both a cover and a case for the iPad mini line. The cover, shown 
in Figure 17-1, is called a smart cover — don’t confuse it with a smart case, 
which is a different product that we describe shortly.

309
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
Made specifically for the iPad mini, the smart cover is ultra-thin and attaches 
magnetically. Flip it open (even just a little), and your iPad wakes instantly; 
flip it shut, and your iPad goes right to sleep. The cover cleverly folds to 
serve as a stand for hands-free viewing (in landscape mode only) or to angle 
the keyboard for easier typing.
The smart cover for the iPad mini is available in polyurethane in seven lus-
cious colors for $39.
If you prefer leather, check out the $69 smart case, which comes in five gor-
geous aniline-dyed shades. The smart case combines a smart cover with a case 
to protect the back of your iPad mini. Like a smart cover, the smart case folds 
into a stand for reading, typing, or watching video. And because it’s “smart,” it 
automatically wakes and sleeps your iPad when you open and close it.
	
Whatever case you choose, make sure it is compatible with your favorite 
accessories. Many accessories won’t work with a smart case (or most other 
cases, for that matter), depending on the size of the cable connector, the case 
opening, and the case thickness.

Apple wireless keyboard
We think the various virtual keyboards that pop up just as you need them 
on the iPad are perfectly fine for shorter typing tasks, whether it’s compos-
ing emails or tapping a few notes. For most longer assignments, however, 
we writers are more comfortable pounding away on a real-deal physical key-
board, and we suspect you feel the same way.
Fortunately, a physical keyboard for the iPad is an easy addition, and because 
it’s the same keyboard that’s been bundled with iMacs for years, you may 
even own one already.
The Apple wireless keyboard, shown in Figure 17-2, is a way to use a decent-
enough aluminum physical keyboard without tethering it to the iPad. It 
operates from up to 30 feet away from the iPad via Bluetooth, the wireless 
technology we discuss in Chapter 15. Which leads us to ask, can you see the 
iPad screen from 30 feet away?
Courtesy of Apple
Figure 17-2: The Apple wireless keyboard.
	
If you have an Apple TV connected to your HDTV, you can stream the screen 
of your iPad to the HDTV by using AirPlay. (See Chapter 8 for the details.) 
And the Apple wireless keyboard is great for using on the couch.
As with many Bluetooth devices that the iPad makes nice with, you have to 
pair it to your tablet. Pairing is also discussed in Chapter 15.
The Bluetooth keyboard takes two AA batteries. It’s smart about power man-
agement, too; it powers itself down when you stop using it to avoid draining 
those batteries. It wakes up when you start typing.

311
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
The Apple wireless keyboard is small and thin. If you carry a backpack, a 
briefcase, a messenger bag, or even a large purse, you almost certainly have 
enough room for a wireless keyboard.
And if your native tongue isn’t English, you’ll be happy to know that Apple 
sells versions of the wireless keyboard in numerous languages, each still $69.
	
Not all the function keys on the wireless keyboard, will, um, function on your 
iPad mini. They’re there, though, because (as we note previously) Apple bun-
dles the same keyboard with the iMac and sells it for other Macs.
	
Although we have tested a few third-party Bluetooth keyboards, the iPad 
ought to work fine with any keyboard that supports Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR 
technology. Bob is currently infatuated with his Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard 
Cover ($89.99), which includes iPad (and iPhone) specific keys, works like a 
smart cover to wake and sleep your iPad mini, and comes in an ultra-thin 
aluminum enclosure that looks great and matches the iPad perfectly. It’s a 
little more expensive than the Apple wireless keyboard, but he says it’s 
worth it.
Finally, you can connect many USB keyboards to your iPad mini with the 
Lightning–to–USB camera adapter discussed in the following section.
Connecting a camera
iPad minis don’t include a USB port or an SD memory card slot, 
which happen to be the most popular methods for getting pic-
tures (and videos) from a digital camera onto a computer.
All the same, the mini is a marvelous photo viewer. So, if you 
take a lot of pictures, consider Apple’s Lightning–to–USB camera 
adapter or the Lightning–to–SD card camera reader, which are 
$29 each. The camera adapter sports a USB interface that you 
can use with the USB cable that came with your camera to 
download pictures. The SD card camera reader is an SD card 
reader with a Lightning connector so you can insert your cam-
era’s SD memory card and transfer pictures.
	
Although the official line from Apple is that this USB adapter is 
meant to work with the USB cable from your digital camera, we 
tried connecting other devices and were able to get an old Dell 
USB keyboard, readers for non–SD-type memory cards, USB

speakers, MIDI keyboards, and more to work with it. But don’t expect all your 
USB devices to be compatible: Some require more power than the iPad mini can 
provide, and others need software drivers that aren’t available on the iPad.
We only hope that despite this helpful accessory, Apple will get around to 
adding a USB and an SD slot to iPads, but so far it hasn’t happened.
Connecting an iPad mini to a TV or projector
The iPad mini is, after all a smallish tablet computer, and when it comes to 
the Retina display, we can’t help but give it high praise. But that display is 
obviously still not nearly as large as a living room TV or a monitor that you 
might see in a conference room or auditorium. To send iPad content to a 
bigger screen, you can choose from three connectors:
	
✓	VGA adapter cable: Projecting what’s on the iPad mini’s screen to a 
larger display is the reason behind the Lightning–to–VGA cable that 
Apple is selling for $49. You can use it to connect your iPad mini to TVs, 
projectors, and VGA displays. What for? To watch videos, slideshows, 
and presentations on the big screen.
	
	By today’s standards, VGA (video graphics array) delivers low-resolution 
video output compared to the more advanced HDMI (high-definition 
multimedia interface).
	
✓	Digital AV adapter cable: The newest addition to the Apple adapter 
family is the Apple digital AV adapter ($49). It uses HDMI, which is pretty 
much a standard on state-of-the-art HDTVs and other modern gear. And 
it comes with a nice bonus: You can mirror the display on your iPad on a 
big-screen TV, which is great for demos and presentations. Ed has used 
this adapter to, among other things, play Angry Birds on the bigger TV 
screen. Bob uses it to watch HD movies in hotel rooms. Both of us think 
it rocks. Be sure to get the Lightning–digital AV model if you have an 
iPad mini 2 or 3.
	
Speaking of mirroring the display of your iPad onto a large-screen TV, you can 
do that wirelessly with iPad as long as you’re streaming to another Apple 
accessory called Apple TV. The streaming is accomplished through AirPlay, 
which we discuss in Chapter 8. Apple TV provides a lot of niceties in its own 
right, even if you don’t own an iPad. (But if you don’t, why are you reading 
this book?) For example, you can watch 1080p high-definition TV shows and 
movies; watch videos on Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Vimeo; listen to music from 
your iTunes library on a PC or Mac or iTunes Radio; and admire photos 
through iCloud, all for just $99.

313
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
Keeping a spare charger
With roughly ten hours of battery life on the Wi-Fi–only iPad mini and nine 
hours on models with cellular access, a single charge can more than get you 
through a typical workday with your iPad mini. But why chance it? Having 
a spare charger at the office can spare you (!) from having to commute with 
one. The Apple iPad 10W USB power adapter sells for $29 and includes a 
lengthy six-foot cord. Again, make sure to get the one with a Lightning cord if 
you have an iPad mini with that connector.
And if you’re traveling abroad, consider the Apple World Travel Adapter Kit. 
The $39 kit includes the proper prongs and adapters for numerous coun-
tries around the globe, and it lets you juice up not only your iPads, but also 
iPhones, iPod touches, and Macs.
Finally, if you have an old iPhone or iPod USB power adapter, or almost any 
other power adapter with a USB port, chances are good it’ll work, though it 
may take longer to charge your iPad mini.
	
If you try to charge your iPad mini with an adapter that doesn’t provide 
enough power, nothing bad will happen. Your iPad mini will merely charge 
much more slowly while it displays a Not Charging message instead of the 
battery-with-a-lightning-bolt icon you see when your iPad mini is connected 
to a charger with sufficient juice.
Listening and Talking with Earphones, 
Headphones, and Headsets
You’ve surely noticed that your iPad mini didn’t include earphones or a 
headset. That’s probably a blessing because the earphones and headsets 
Apple has included with iPods and iPhones since time immemorial aren’t 
that good. In fact, Bob referred to them as “mediocre and somewhat uncom-
fortable” in almost every article he’s written about the iPod or iPhone. Ed 
agrees. For what it’s worth, iPhones and iPod touches now include Apple’s 
redesigned — and much improved — EarPods.
	
Apple acquired a genuine headphone company, Beats, so Apple may leverage 
this purchase in some way and supply or at least make available top-notch 
Beats headphones. But as of this writing, all iPads ship without headphones, 
so you get to select a pair of headphones, earphones, or a headset that suits 
your needs and your budget. That’s good, right?

314
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Wired headphones, earphones, and headsets
Search Amazon for headphones, earphones, or headsets, and you’ll find 
thousands of each available at prices ranging from around $10 to more than 
$1,000. Or if you prefer to shop in a bricks-and-mortar store, Target, Best Buy, 
and the Apple Store all have decent selections, with prices starting at less 
than $20.
	
Much as we love the shopping experience at Apple Stores, you won’t find any 
bargains there because Apple-branded products are rarely discounted. 
However, you can almost always find non-Apple items such as headphones, 
earphones, and headsets cheaper somewhere else.
With so many brands and models of earphones, headphones, and headsets 
available from so many manufacturers at so many price points, we can’t pos-
sibly test even a fraction of the ones available today. That said, we’ve prob-
ably tested more of them than most people, and we have our favorites.
When it comes to headphones, Bob is partial to his SR60i from Grado, which 
is legendary for offering astonishingly accurate audio at an affordable price 
(around $80). He’s tried headphones that cost twice, thrice, or even more 
times as much that he didn’t think sounded nearly as good. Find out more at 
www.gradolabs.com.
Ed goes with sweet-sounding, albeit pricey (about $350) Bose QuietComfort 3 
acoustic noise-canceling headphones and Monster Inspiration over-the-ear 
noise-canceling headphones (about $300).
For earphones and earphone-style headsets, Bob likes the Klipsch Image 
S4 headphones and S4i in-ear headset with mic and three-button remote. 
At around $79 and $99, respectively, they sound better than many similarly 
priced products, and better than many more-expensive offerings.
Bluetooth stereo headphones, 
earphones, and headsets
Neither of us has much experience with Bluetooth (wireless) stereo head-
phones and headsets, but we thought we’d at least plant the seed. The idea 
is that with Bluetooth stereo headphones, earphones, and headsets, you 
can listen to music wirelessly up to 33 feet away from your iPad mini. If this 
sounds good to you, we suggest that you look for reviews of such products 
on the web before you decide which one to buy. A search of Amazon for 
stereo Bluetooth headset brought up thousands of items, with prices starting 
as low as $11.99.

315
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
For what it’s worth, Bob has been quite happy with his BlueAnt Pump HD 
Stereo Sportsbuds, a Bluetooth stereo headset he occasionally uses with 
his iPhone and iPad mini. He says they sound better and stay put in his ears 
better than other Bluetooth stereo headsets he’s tried. They’re also water-
proof and sweat-proof.
Listening with Speakers
You can connect just about any speakers to your iPad mini, but if you want 
decent sound, we suggest you look only at powered speakers, not passive 
(unpowered) ones. Powered speakers contain their own amplification cir-
cuitry and can deliver much better (and louder) sound than unpowered 
speakers.
Prices range from well under $100 to hundreds (or even thousands) of dol-
lars. Most speaker systems designed for use with your computer, iPod, or 
iPhone work well as long as they have an auxiliary input or a Lightning con-
nector that can accommodate your iPad mini.
Earphones? Headphones? Headsets?
We refer to headphones and headsets several 
times and thought you might be wondering 
whether a difference exists and, if so, what it is. 
When we talk about headphones or earphones, 
we’re talking about the things you use to listen 
to music. A headset adds a microphone so that 
you can use it for voice chatting, schmoozing 
with Siri, FaceTime video chatting, and (in the 
case of the iPhone or Internet VOIP services 
such as Skype) for phone calls. So headphones 
and earphones are for listening, and headsets 
are for both talking and listening.
Now you may be wondering whether earphones 
and headphones are the same. To some people, 
they may be, but to us, headphones have a band 
across the top (or back) of your head, and the 
listening apparatus is big and covers the out-
side of your ears. Think of the big fat things 
you see covering a radio disk jockey’s ears. 
Earphones (sometimes referred to as earbuds), 
on the other hand, are smaller, fit entirely in your 
ear, and have no band across the top or back of 
your head.
Headsets can be earphone style or, less com-
monly, headphone style. The distinguishing 
factor is that headsets always include a micro-
phone. And some headsets are designed spe-
cifically for use with Apple i-products (iPhone, 
iPod, iPad) and have integrated play/pause and 
volume control buttons.
One last thing: Some companies refer to their 
earbud products as headphones, but we think 
that’s confusing and wrong. So in this book, 
headphones are those bulky, outside-the-ear 
things, and earphones are teeny-tiny things that 
fit entirely in your ear.

316
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
Desktop speakers
Logitech (www.logitech.com) makes a range of desktop speaker systems 
priced from less than $25 to more than $300. But that $300 system is the 
Z5500 THX-certified 505-watt 5.1 digital surround system — surely overkill 
for listening to music or video on your iPad mini, which doesn’t support sur-
round sound anyway. The point is that Logitech makes a variety of decent 
systems at a wide range of price points. If you’re looking for something inex-
pensive, you can’t go wrong with a Logitech-powered speaker system.
Bob is a big fan of Audioengine (www.audioengineusa.com) desktop speak-
ers. They deliver superior audio at prices that are reasonable for speakers that 
sound this good. Audioengine 5 is the premium product priced at $349 per 
pair; Audioengine 2 is its smaller but still excellent sibling priced at $199 per 
pair. They’re available only direct from the manufacturer, but the company is 
so confident that you’ll love them that it offers a free audition for the speaker 
systems. If you order a pair and don’t love them, return them within 30 days 
for a full refund. Bob knows a lot of people who have ordered them, and so far 
no one has sent them back.
Bluetooth speakers
Like Bluetooth headsets, Bluetooth speakers let you listen to music up to 
33 feet away from your iPad mini. They’re great for listening by the pool or 
hot tub or anywhere else you might not want to take your iPad.
Both of us have written favorable reviews of the $149.99 wireless Jambox 
by Jawbone, a rechargeable speaker that offers very good sound despite 
being able to fit into the palm of your hand. You can connect via Bluetooth 
or its auxiliary stereo jack. A bonus: Jambox doubles as a decent-enough 
speakerphone.
Jawbone has also introduced the Big Jambox. Quick quiz: What do you think 
that means? Right, a bigger version of the Jambox with bigger sound. Of 
course, at $299.99, it also carries a bigger price, and it’s a bit less portable 
than its diminutive sibling. And because this isn’t a one-size-fits-all society, 
Jawbone more recently introduced the Mini Jambox, which comes in multiple 
colors, and commands $129.99.
Ed also likes a big rival to the Big Jambox, the Bose SoundLink wireless 
mobile speaker, which fetches a similar price.
After reading Ed’s review, Bob traveled with a Jawbone Jambox for years and 
liked it. Then he got Ultimate Ears’ Boom wireless speaker/speakerphone 
($199.95), of which he says, “blows the doors off the Jambox,” and the best-
sounding $200 Bluetooth speaker he ever tested.

317
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
AirPlay speakers
The newest type of speakers you might choose for your iPad mini support 
Apple’s proprietary AirPlay protocol, which takes advantage of your existing 
Wi-Fi network to stream audio and/or video from your iPad mini (or other 
compatible iDevice) to a single AirPlay-enabled speaker or audio/video 
receiver.
The biggest differences between AirPlay and Bluetooth speakers are
	
✓	Bluetooth can stream music only in a compressed form; AirPlay can 
stream music (and video) uncompressed. So, a speaker with AirPlay 
should sound better than a similar speaker with Bluetooth.
	
✓	Bluetooth’s range is roughly 30 feet; AirPlay’s range is up to 300 feet. You 
can’t extend Bluetooth’s range; Wi-Fi range can easily be extended with 
inexpensive routers such as Apple’s AirPort Express ($99).
	
✓	iTunes (on your computer) can use AirPlay to stream audio or video to 
multiple speakers or audio/video receivers, with individual volume con-
trols for each device; Bluetooth streams to only one device at a time.
Docking your iPad mini with an extender cable
Because the iPad mini is much larger than an iPod or iPhone, you can’t just 
dock the iPad mini into a speaker system designed for the smaller devices. 
All is not lost if you’re partial to those speakers and still want to connect the 
iPad mini. CableJive (http://cablejive.com), RadTech (www.radtech.
us), and others sell dock extender cables, which allow you to use your iPad 
with any docking device no matter how small or which connector it uses. 
Apple also sells a 30-pin–to–Lightning adapter cable, allowing you to connect 
an iPad to one of these speaker systems.
Wrapping Your iPad mini in Third-Party Cases
Much as we like the Apple iPad mini smart case and smart cover, other ven-
dors also offer excellent and different options. Following are some of our faves:
	
✓	Griffin Technology: Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.
com) also has a pretty good selection of iPad cases at reasonable prices.
	
✓	iLuv: iLuv (www.i-luv.com) is yet another case maker with a range 
of affordable cases fabricated from leather, fabric, and silicone, none of 
which costs more than $40.

318
Part V: The Undiscovered iPad mini 
	
✓	Vario: ZeroChroma (www.zerochroma.com) has Bob’s current favorite 
Vario SC case for the iPad mini for $49.95. The big attraction is the 16-angle 
rotating theater stand on the back that folds flush when not in use. And it 
works great with an Apple smart cover if you care to use one. Sweet!
	
✓	BookBook: The BookBook case from Twelve South (www.twelvesouth.
com) looks like a fine vintage hardbound book but is actually a handsome 
iPad case and stand ($69.99–$79.99).
	
✓	LifeProof nüüd: This case may be bulky and relatively expensive, but it is 
waterproof, dirtproof, snowproof, and shockproof. Bob says his second-
generation iPad, which has been dropped several times and soaked in a 
spa more than once, would have died long ago without the LifeProof case 
(www.lifeproof.com). While connecting earphones or docking cables 
is more of a hassle than with most cases, and it’s not cheap ($119.99), 
Bob says it’s a lot cheaper than a new iPad. He’s still using it today.
	
✓	The iPad Bubble Sleeve: From Hard Candy Cases (www.hardcandy 
cases.com), the iPad Bubble Sleeve ($49.95) offers significantly better 
protection against bumps and scratches than any other case we’ve seen. 
If we expected our iPads to be exposed to moderate impacts, this case’s 
rigid exterior and additional shock-absorbing rubber bumpers for the 
screen make it the case we’d choose.
But Wait . . . There’s More!
Before we leave the topic of accessories, we think you should know about a 
few more products, namely, film protection products that guard your iPad’s 
exterior (or screen) without adding a bit of bulk: the Griffin Technology 
A-Frame tabletop stand for your iPad, and 2-into-1 stereo adapters.
Protecting the screen with film
Some people prefer not to use a case with their iPads, and that’s okay, too. 
But if you’re one of those people (or even if you’re not), you might want to 
consider protective film for the iPad screen or even the entire device. We’ve 
tried these products on our iPads in the past and have found them to per-
form as promised. If you apply them properly, they’re nearly invisible, and 
they protect your iPad from scratches and scrapes without adding any bulk.
Bob recently discovered the joys of iVisor AG Screen Protector for iPad 
($30) from Moshi (www.moshimonde.com) and says it’s still the best screen 
cover he’s tested to date. It’s easy to apply, resists fingerprints better than 
Apple’s oleophobic screen coating, and features patented technology for a 

319
 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
bubble-free installation every time. The best feature, Bob believes, is that if it 
gets dirty, you just remove it, wash it under a faucet, air-dry it, and reapply it 
(bubble-free, of course).
Another option is from the aforementioned RadTech (www.radtech.us), 
which offers two types of Mylar screen protectors — transparent and anti-
glare. These screen protectors are somewhat stiffer than the film products, 
and unlike film, they can be cleaned and reapplied multiple times with no 
reduction in performance. They effectively hide minor scratches, surface 
defects, and abrasions, and the hard Mylar surface not only resists scratches 
and abrasions but is also optically correct. Finally, they’re reasonably priced 
at $19.95 for a pair of protectors of the same type.
Bob has also tested more traditional film products from InvisibleShield by 
ZAGG (www.zagg.com), BodyGuardz (www.bodyguardz.com), and Best 
Skins Ever (www.bestskinsever.com) and says, in a nutshell, they’re more 
similar than they are different. If you want to protect your screen with film, 
get whichever has the price and warranty that suits your needs.
	
These skins can be tricky to apply (including the iVisor AG, which is the easi-
est of all to install). Follow the instructions closely, watch videos on the ven-
dors’ websites and YouTube, and take your time. If you do, you’ll be rewarded 
with clear film protection that’s nearly invisible yet protects your iPad from 
scratches, nicks, and cuts.
	
The last time we checked, Best Buy will apply these skins for you for less 
than $10, which may be a bargain compared to messing things up and having 
to buy another skin. Ask your favorite electronics retailer if it provides a simi-
lar service.
Standing up your iPad
The Griffin A-Frame ($39.99) is so unusual that we just had to include it. 
As you can see in Figure 17-4, it’s a dual-purpose desktop stand made of 
heavy-duty aluminum. You can open it to hold your iPad in either portrait 
or landscape mode for video watching, displaying pictures (a great way to 
exploit picture frame mode, as we describe in Chapter 9), or even reading. 
In this upright mode, it’s also the perfect companion for the Apple wireless 
keyboard (or any other Bluetooth keyboard for that matter). Or close the legs 
and lay it down, and it puts your iPad at the perfect angle for using the on-
screen keyboard.

Figure 17-4: The Griffin A-Frame is a unique, dual-purpose tabletop stand for your iPad.
Soft silicone padding keeps your iPad from getting scratched or sliding 
around, and the bottom lip is designed to 
accommodate the charging cable in portrait 
mode. Furthermore, it works with many 
third-party cases, including Griffin’s flexible 
and hard-shell cases, among others.
Bob says, “I really, really like this thing; it’s 
where my iPad resides pretty much any time 
it’s not in my backpack.” Sadly, it’s been dis-
continued, though you can still find new ones 
if you scour the Internet.
The iKlip (www.ikmultimedia.com; $29.99) 
stand may not look as cool as Griffin’s, 
but it is lightweight, folds flat, as shown in 
Figure 17-5, and is still widely available. Bob 
says: “I also love my iKlip Studio and rarely 
leave home without it.”
Sharing your iPad mini with 
a 2-into-1 stereo adapter
A 2-into-1 stereo adapter is a handy little device that lets two people plug 
their headphones, earphones, or headsets into one iPad (or iPod or iPhone, 
for that matter). They’re inexpensive (less than $10) and extremely useful if

 Chapter 17: Accessorizing Your iPad mini
you’re traveling with a friend by air, sea, rail, or bus. They’re also great when 
you want to watch a movie with your BFF but don’t want to risk waking the 
neighbors or roommates.
	
We call ’em 2-into-1 stereo adapters, but that’s not the only name they go by. 
Other names you might see for the same device include
	
✓	3.5mm stereo Y-splitter
	
✓	⅛-inch stereo 1-plug-to-2-jacks adapter
	
✓	⅛-inch stereo Y-adapter
	
✓	3.5mm dual stereo headphone jack splitter
You need to know only two things. The first is that ⅛-inch and 3.5mm are 
used interchangeably in the adapter world (even though they’re not really 
the same).
Some measurements to keep in mind: ⅛ inch = 0.125 inch, whereas 3.5mm = 
0.1378 inch. Not the same, but close enough for rock ’n’ roll.
	
The second is that you want to make sure that you get a stereo adapter. Some 
monaural adapters work but pump the same sound into both ears, instead of 
sending the audio information for the left stereo channel to your left ear and 
the right stereo channel to your right.
In other words, you need a ⅛-inch or 3.5mm stereo adapter that has a single 
stereo plug on one end (to plug into your iPad mini) and two stereo jacks on 
the other (to accommodate two sets of headphones/earphones/headsets).
	
Test the adapter before you travel. Bob discovered that the one he had 
packed was much louder for one person than the other.

iller app is familiar jargon to anyone who has spent 
any time around computers. The term refers to an 
application so sweet or so useful that just about every-
body wants or must have it.
You could make the argument that the most com-
pelling killer app on the iPad mini is the very 
App Store we expound on in Chapter 11. This 
online emporium has an abundance of splendid 
programs — dare we say killer apps in their own 
right? — many of which are free. These cover every-
thing from food (hey, you gotta eat) to showbiz. Okay, 
so some rotten apples (aren’t we clever) are in the 
bunch, too. But we’re here to accentuate the positive.
With that in mind, in this chapter, we offer ten of our favorite 
free iPad apps. In Chapter 19, we tell you about our favorite iPad apps 
that aren’t free but are worth every penny.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
We show you ours, and we encourage you to show us yours. If you discover 
your own killer iPad apps, by all means, let us know — our email addresses are 
at the end of the Introduction to this book — so that we can check them out.
TripCase
We both travel more than most people and are somewhat set in our ways. 
Before a trip, we use our computers to print boarding passes, hotel and 
rental car details, and any other info we might need while in transit. The 
printouts are strictly analog, so they don’t notify us (or anyone else) of gate 
changes or flight delays or cancellations. And, of course, they can’t remind 
us to check in. Still, the system works reliably unless we lose our printed 
documents.
It may be old school, but it’s the best we could do until recently. What we 
wished and hoped for was a single intelligent repository for travel-related 
information, one that was smart enough to alert us of gate changes, weather 
delays, flight cancellations, and the like, and one that was easy to configure, 
convenient to use, and free.
What we found is TripCase, which is all that and more. It’s a free app (and 
website) that organizes details of each trip in one place, with reminders and 
flight alerts delivered directly to your iPad mini.
TripCase has a lot to like, but one thing we like best is that it’s drop-dead 
simple to add your travel events — without copying and pasting or even 
typing. We merely forward our confirmation emails — for flights, hotels, 
rental cars, and other travel-related services — to trips@tripcase.com. 
TripCase parses the details, creates an itinerary, and sends us an email to 
confirm that our trip is ready to view in TripCase. We’ve forwarded confir-
mations from at least a half dozen travel providers, and TripCase has never 
failed to interpret them correctly. (And you can always enter details the old-
fashioned way — by copying and pasting or typing.)
After TripCase has your info, you can view it in the TripCase app or in any 
web browser. The app is well-organized, with a timeline view of the itiner-
ary (as shown in Figure 18-1), and details are but a tap away (as shown in 
Figure 18-2). TripCase also includes an action view with flight alerts, remind-
ers, and other messages. Any way you look at it, TripCase does most of the 
work for you.
TripCase can even help you locate an alternate flight based on your original 
reservation should your flight be cancelled or delayed. And it reminds you to 
check in and print boarding passes 24 hours before each flight. Sweet!

327
 Chapter 18: Ten Appetizing and Free Apps
TripCase’s motto is “stress-free travel.” Although it may not make travel 
stress free — or increase the legroom in and around a cramped airline 
seat — it definitely makes travel less stressful.
One last thing: TripCase is an iPhone app but one that’s so good and works 
so well on an iPad mini that we just couldn’t omit it for not being a native 
iPad app (yet).
Words with Friends
This brings us to perhaps the only time in this entire book that your authors 
had a disagreement. Both of us love word games and puzzles, but Bob loves 
Words with Friends HD, whereas Ed prefers the real thing: namely, Scrabble.
Social media is all the rage these days, but most multiplayer iPad games are 
either boring or not particularly social. Words with Friends HD ($2.99), on the 
other hand, is the most social game Bob has found — and a ton of fun, too. 
It’s kind of like playing Scrabble with a friend, but because it’s turn-based, 
you can make a move and then quit the app and do other stuff. When your 
friend makes his next move, you can choose to be notified that it’s your turn 
by sound, on-screen alert, and/or a number on the Words with Friends icon 
on your Home screen.

Bob says: “Try it and I’m sure you’ll be hooked. Then challenge me if you like; 
my username is boblevitus (although I often have the maximum 20 games 
going, so keep trying if I don’t accept your challenge right away).”
NFL Mobile
Ed is an avid football fan who routinely peeks at his iPad mini while watching 
games on TV, to follow his favorite team (the New York Giants), to follow his 
fantasy team, and to stay on top of the latest scoops and scores. The digital 
arm of the National Football League designed its NFL Mobile app to appeal to 
the legions of folks who live and breathe the sport.
You can watch high-
lights of games or 
check out other fea-
tured videos, organized 
under themes such as 
Top 5 Catches, Drive 
of the Week, and Can’t 
Miss Plays. You can 
also listen to audio 
broadcasts of games 
(in English or Spanish). 
And you can exchange 
tickets, purchase team 
apparel, or buy other 
NFL paraphernalia — 
hey, in case you haven’t 
noticed, football is big 
business. During an 
actual game, you can 
chart the action inside an animated graphic of an NFL stadium, as shown in 
Figure 18-3.
Although the app is free, Verizon customers who shell out $5 per month can 
watch Thursday Night Football (via NFL Network), Monday Night Football 
(ESPN), and Sunday Night Football (NBC). You can also watch NFL Network at 
all times, and NFL RedZone on Sunday afternoons, which shows action across 
the league when teams enter scoring territory.
The league has also unleashed a couple of companion apps, NFL Now, which 
supplies personalized video streams of your favorite teams and players and 
(through a premium offering) access to the rich NFL Films video archive, 
and NFL Fantasy Football, in which you can manage and follow your fantasy 
roster.

 Chapter 18: Ten Appetizing and Free Apps
Movies by Flixster
We like movies, so we 
both use the Flixster 
app a lot. Feed it your 
zip code and then 
browse local theaters 
by movie, showtimes, 
rating, or distance from 
your current location. 
Or browse to find a 
movie you like and 
then tap to find the-
aters, showtimes, and 
other info, as shown 
in Figure 18-4. Another 
nice feature is the capa-
bility to buy tickets to 
most movies from your 
iPad mini with just a 
few additional taps.
We appreciate that we can read reviews, play movie trailers, and email movie 
listings to others with a single tap. We also enjoy the movie trailers for soon-
to-be-released films and DVDs. Other free movie showtime apps are out there, 
but we like Flixster the most.
IMDb Movies & TV
While we’re on the subject of the silver screen, we couldn’t resist opening 
IMDb, shorthand for Internet Movie Database (owned by Amazon). And what 
a database it is, especially for the avid filmgoer. This vast and delightful 
repository of all things cinema is the place to go for complete cast/crew list-
ings, actor/filmmaker bios, plot summaries, movie trailers, critics’ reviews, 
user ratings, parental guidance, famous quotations, and all kinds of trivia.
You can always search for movies, TV shows, actors, and so on by typing 
a name in the search box in the upper-right corner of the screen. Or tap 
Browse at the lower left to find current movies by showtimes, what’s coming 
soon, or box office results. You can browse TV recaps, too, or find people 
born on the day you happen to be looking and poking around the app. It’s 
also fun to check out the Trending Celebrities on IMDb. The recent roster 
included Shailene Woodley, Dylan O’Brien, James Spader, Aaron Paul, Scarlett 
Johansson, Bryan Cranston, Charlie Hunnam, Jennifer Lawrence, Amber 
Heard, Chris Pratt, and on and on.
Figure 18-4: Find out showtimes, watch the trailer, or get more 
info on the director or cast with a single tap.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
One piece of advice to movie buffs: Avoid IMDb if you have a lot of work to 
do. You’ll have a hard time closing the curtain on this marvelous app.
Netflix
Flixster, IMDb, and now Netflix. You’ve no doubt detected a real trend by 
now, and that trend is indeed our affection for movies and TV shows. If you 
love TV and movies, too, you’re sure to be a fan of the Netflix app. Over time, 
Netflix, the company that built its reputation by sending DVDs to subscribers 
through the mail, started streaming movies over the Internet to computers, 
TVs, and other consumer electronics gear. You can now add the iPad and 
iPad mini to that list.
From the mini, you have more or less instant access to thousands of movies 
on demand. And although these titles aren’t exactly current blockbusters, we 
know you’ll find plenty of films worth seeing. You can search by genre (clas-
sics, comedy, drama, and so on) and subgenre (courtroom dramas, political 
dramas, romantic dramas, and so on).
What’s more, Netflix has started producing its own shows, including House of 
Cards featuring Kevin Spacey, which Ed binged on.
Although the app is free, as are the movies you choose to watch on the 
fly, you have to pay Netflix streaming subscription fees that start at $7.99 
a month. You also need an Internet connection, preferably through Wi-Fi, 
although Netflix works on 3G and 4G models as well.
	
Remember what we’ve told you about streaming movies over 3G or 4G and be 
mindful of your data plan.
DVD Netflix subscribers might quibble about the fact that you can’t manage 
your DVD queue inside the app.
Comics
The Comics app is a fantastic way to read comic books on a 7.9-inch touch-
screen. Its online store features thousands of comics and comic series from 
dozens of publishers, including Arcana, Archie, Marvel, Devil’s Due, Digital 
Webbing, Red 5, DC Comics, and Zenescope, as well as hundreds of free 
comics.
Furthermore, many titles are classics, like issue #1 of The Amazing Spider-
Man. Released in 1963 for $0.12, a copy in excellent condition goes for at least 
$25,000 today! We’re enjoying this out-of-print classic in pristine condition on 
our iPads, as shown in Figure 18-5, for a mere $1.99.

331
 Chapter 18: Ten Appetizing and Free Apps
Other comics are priced from $0.99 
per issue, though many issues of 
many series are available for free as 
a teaser.
Finally, this app provides a great way 
to organize the comics you own on 
your iPad mini so that you can find 
the one you want quickly and easily.
New releases are available every 
Wednesday, so visit the web store 
often to check out the latest and 
greatest offerings. Both the store and 
your personal comic collection are 
well organized and easy to use. And 
reading comics in Comics is a plea-
sure you won’t want to miss if you’re 
a fan of comics or graphic novels.
Amazon bought this app (and its 
maker, Comixology) in 2013, and 
it’s not as good as it used to be. 
The current version requires you to 
visit the Comixology website to buy 
comics, which you then download to the Comics app. Before Amazon bought 
the Comics app, it had its own built-in comic bookstore, which made buying 
a comic more convenient and straightforward. We hope Amazon will recon-
sider and bring back the in-app store someday. However, even with the con-
voluted buying process, we still don’t know of anything that offers a better 
reading experience for comics and graphic novels.
Epicurious Recipes & Shopping List
We love to eat. But we’re writers, not gourmet chefs, so we’ll take all the help 
we can get when it comes to preparing a great meal. And we get a lot of that 
culinary assistance from Epicurious, which easily lives up to its billing as the 
“Cook’s Companion.” This tasty recipe app comes courtesy of Condé Nast 
Digital.
Tap the Control Panel button in the upper-left corner of the screen to get 
started, and you can find a yummy recipe in no time. Tap Featured in the 
Control Panel (if it’s not already highlighted) to find recipes that have been 
lumped into categories, often timed to the season. Around the time we

comics on your iPad mini.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
were writing this book, recipe collection categories included Vegetarian 
Thanksgiving, Holiday Sides, Kid-Friendly Mains, Cozy Winter Meals, and 
more. To which we say, “Yum.” Some recipes carry reviews.
If you tap Search in the Control Panel instead, you can fine-tune your search 
for a recipe by food or drink, by main ingredient (for example, banana, 
chicken, pasta), by cuisine type, and by dietary consideration (low-carb, 
vegan, kosher, and so on), among other parameters.
When you discover a recipe you like, you can add it to a collection of favor-
ites, email it to a friend, pass along the ingredients to your shopping list, 
summon nutritional information, or share it on Facebook and Twitter.
If you want to sync favorite recipes on your iPhone and iPad mini through 
a personal recipe box on Epicurious.com, that’ll cost you $1.99 as an in-app 
purchase.
Bon appétit.
Evernote
Before we even talk about the Evernote iPad app, let’s take a quick look at the 
problem Evernote resolves for us: storing our little bits of digital information — 
text, pictures, screen shots, scanned images, receipts, bills, email messages, 
web pages, and other info we might want to recall someday — and synchroniz-
ing all the data among all our devices and the cloud.
Evernote (www.evernote.com) is all that and more, with excellent free apps 
for iOS, Mac OS X, Android, and Windows, plus a killer web interface that 
works in most browsers.
You can create notes of any length on your iPad mini by typing, dictating, or 
photographing. You can add unlimited tags to a note, and create unlimited 
notebooks to organize your rapidly growing collection of notes.
	
You can even annotate images and PDFs in Evernote notes, using another free 
app from Evernote called Skitch, which we also recommend without 
hesitation.
Getting words and images into Evernote couldn’t be much easier, but the 
info will be useless if you can’t find it when you need it. Evernote won’t let 
you down, with myriad options for finding and working with your stored 
data. In addition to the aforementioned tags and notebooks, Evernote offers 

333
 Chapter 18: Ten Appetizing and Free Apps
searching and filtering (Tags and 
Notebooks) options to help you 
find the note you need, as shown in 
Figure 18-6.
Two other nice touches are worth 
noting:
	
✓	Notes are automatically tagged 
with your current location (as 
long as you create them on 
your iPad or other location-
enabled device), so you can 
filter by Places.
	
✓	You can attach reminders to 
notes and receive notifica-
tion on the date and time 
you chose. Best of all, you’ll 
be notified on your iPad as 
well as on your other iDe-
vices, Macs, PCs, and on the 
Evernote website!
Our two favorite features are that 
Evernote syncs notes with all your 
devices and the cloud automati-
cally and that everything we’ve mentioned so far — creating, organizing, and 
syncing notes — is free.
Bob likes Evernote so much that he recently upgraded to the premium plan 
($5/month or $45/year), primarily to increase his monthly upload limit from 
60MB to 1GB and to get the capability to search for text in PDFs.
Pandora Radio
We’ve long been fans of Pandora on other computers and mobile devices, so 
we’re practically delirious that this custom Internet radio service is available 
gratis on the iPad. And you can play Pandora music in the background while 
doing other stuff.
Pandora works on the iPad mini in much the same way that it does on a 
Mac or PC. In the box at the upper left, type the name of a favorite artist, 
song title, or composer via the iPad mini keyboard, and Pandora creates an 
Figure 18-6: Evernote’s main screen only hints at 
how easy it is to create and find notes.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
instant personalized radio station 
with selections that exemplify the 
style you chose. Along the left panel 
of Figure 18-7, you see some of the 
eclectic stations Ed created. Tapping 
QuickMix at the top of the list plays 
musical selections across all your 
stations.
Suppose that you type Beatles. 
Pandora’s instant Beatles station 
includes performances from John, 
Paul, George, and Ringo, as well as 
tunes from other acts.
And say that you type a song title, 
such as Have I Told You Lately. 
Pandora constructs a station 
with similar music after you tell it 
whether to base tunes on the Van 
Morrison, Rod Stewart, or another 
rendition.
Pandora comes out of the Music 
Genome Project, an organization of 
musicians and technologists who analyze music according to hundreds of 
attributes (such as melody, harmony, and vocal performances).
You can help fine-tune the music Pandora plays by tapping the thumbs-up or 
thumbs-down icon at the top of the screen above the album covers associ-
ated with the music you’ve been listening to during the current session.
Pandora also takes advantage of the generous screen real estate of the iPad 
mini to deliver artist profiles, lyrics, and more. (Refer to Figure 18-7.) You may 
see ads, too.
	
If you tap the share icon below an album cover of the currently playing song, 
you can write a message about the song, and then share it on Facebook or 
Twitter or email it. Other options in Pandora let you bookmark the song or 
artist that’s playing or head to iTunes to purchase the song or other material 
from the artist directly on the iPad (if available). You can instantly create sta-
tions from artists or tracks or also indicate when you’re tired of a track.
	
Before we leave the realm of the free apps, we’d like to remind you of an 11th 
freebie — a free app so wonderful that we wrote an entire chapter 
(Chapter 10) about it. The app is iBooks.
Figure 18-7: Have we told you lately how much 
we like The Beatles and Pandora?

f you read Chapter 18, you know that lots of great free 
apps are available for your iPad mini. But as the 
cliché goes, some things are worth paying for. Still, 
none of the ten for-pay apps we’ve chosen as some of 
our favorites are likely to break the bank. As you’re 
about to discover, some apps in this list are practi-
cal, and some are downright silly. The common 
theme? We think you’ll like carrying these apps 
around on your iPad mini.
Bill Atkinson PhotoCard
Who is Bill Atkinson? He had a hand (or both hands) in 
the first Macintosh computer, as well as in the MacPaint and 
HyperCard Mac applications. Today he’s a world-renowned nature 
photographer, which brings us to his app. Bill Atkinson PhotoCard is a free 
app that lets you create gorgeous high-resolution postcards and send them 
via either email or the U.S. Postal Service.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
But the reason we love it is that you can have printed postcards sent via USPS 
for $1.50 to $2.00 per postcard, depending on how many print-and-mail credits 
you purchase. The 8.25-x-5.5-inch postcards are, in a word, stunning. Printed on 
heavy glossy stock on a 
state-of-the-art HP Indigo 
Digital Press and then 
laminated for protec-
tion, they’re as beautiful 
as any postcard you’ve 
ever seen.
You can use one of the 
200 included Bill Atkin­
son nature photos, as 
shown in Figure 19-1, or 
you can use any picture 
in your Photos library. 
You can add stickers 
and stamps, as shown in 
Figure 19-1, and you can 
even add voice notes to 
emailed cards.
	
If you’re still uncertain, download the app (it’s free) and try it. Send an email 
postcard or two to yourself. After you’ve seen how gorgeous these cards can 
be and how easy the app is to use, we think you’ll spring for some print-and-
mail credits and take your iPad mini on your next vacation as Bob always 
does.
Real Racing 3
Real Racing 3 is one of Bob’s all-time favorite games on any platform. He usu-
ally hates car-racing games, but this one’s awesome — it’s gorgeous, with 
super-realistic physics and an incredible selection of exotic cars. Although 
it’s free to download and we hear you can play it all the way through without 
buying anything, we’re grouping it with the apps that cost money because 
you’ll probably find yourself spending at least a few bucks to upgrade your 
cars or buy new, faster ones. Real Racking 3 runs on most iDevices, but we 
prefer playing on an iPad or iPad mini.
The course of the game involves more than two dozen series, with each 
series limited to four closely matched car models and featuring about 50 
events. Event types include cup races, which are the most prevalent event 
type and which pit you against up to 22 opponents; time trials, in which you

gorgeous nature photos.

race against the clock or the ghosts of other racers; and drag race, which is 
short and straight with a twist — you have to shift the manual transmission 
flawlessly to win.
The object is to win races and reach series milestones to earn racing 
dollars and gold, which you can use to buy better cars, upgrades, and 
customizations.
Although the game is free to download, you can buy all the racing dollars 
and gold coins you like using real money. Bob says that’s like cheating; with 
nearly 300 hours of racing under his belt, he’s spent less than $25 (for a 
McLaren that was on sale for a limited time and a couple of other cool cars he 
didn’t want to wait to own).
Races take place on a 
dozen faithfully recreated 
virtual tracks, includ-
ing the Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway, 
Hockenheimring, and 
Silverstone (shown in 
Figure 19-2). With an 
Internet connection, you 
can race against friends 
in real time. If your 
friends aren’t online, 
you can play against 
time-shifted multiplayer 
racers, which are artifi-
cially intelligent oppo-
nents based on your 
friends’ performances.
After a few races (fewer if you drive recklessly, like Bob), your car needs 
repairs that can take up to three hours in real time. You can’t race again until 
repairs are completed, but you can skip the wait for some gold coins.
We feel obliged to warn you that Real Racing 3 is seriously addictive. As men-
tioned, Bob has played nearly 300 hours but has completed only 65 percent 
of the events.
With hundreds and hundreds of hours of nonrepetitive gameplay, Real 
Racing 3 is still so much fun that even after playing it for more than a year, 
Bob still plays almost every day.
One last thing: Bob’s handle is doctor-mac, and he says, “See you on the 
track!”

ArtStudio for iPad
Do you fancy yourself an artist? We 
know our artistic talent is limited, 
but if we were talented, ArtStudio 
for iPad is the program we’d use to 
paint our masterpieces. Even if you 
have limited artistic talent, you can 
see that this app has everything you 
need to create awesome artwork.
We were embarrassed to show you 
our creations, so instead we whipped 
up Figure 19-3, which shows just the 
options for just one of ArtStudio’s 
tools (there are dozens and dozens 
more).
Here are just some of ArtStudio for 
iPad’s features:
	
✓	Offers 25 brushes, including 
pencils, a smudge tool, bucket 
fill, and an airbrush. Brushes 
are resizable and simulate brush 
pressure.
	
✓	Allows up to five layers with options, such as delete, reorder, duplicate, 
merge, and transparency.
	
✓	Provides filters, such as blur, sharpen, detect edges, and sepia.
Don’t believe us? AppSmile.com (www.appsmile.com) rated it 5 out of 5, 
saying, “This is what Photoshop Mobile wishes it had been.” SlapApp.com 
(www.slapapp.com) also rated it 5 out of 5 and said, “I’ve dabbled in quite a 
few painting and drawing apps and this one has ’em all beat by a long shot.” 
And by all means, check out what talented artists can do with ArtStudio for 
iPad at www.flickr.com/groups/artstudioimages.
One last thing: The app was only $0.99 when we bought our copies — a spe-
cial launch sale price. The price has gone up, but even at the new price, a 
whopping $4.99, it’s still a heck of a deal for a thoughtfully designed and full-
featured drawing and painting app.
	
Beware of rip-offs in the iTunes App Store, such as the similarly named Art 
Studio HD — For Your iPad. That one’s a bad knock-off from developer Party 
Sub Productions that has garnered mostly 1-star ratings. Don’t be fooled — 
the app you’re looking for is ArtStudio for iPad, from Lucky Clan. Note that

Art and Studio are run together to form a single word; if you search for the

Pinball Crystal Caliburn II
Good pinball games require supremely realistic physics, and Pinball Crystal 
Caliburn II ($3.99) nails it. The way the ball moves around the table and inter-
acts with bumpers and flippers is so realistic that you’ll think you’re at an 
arcade. The app is so realistic, in fact, that you can shake the table to influ-
ence the ball’s movement.
Another hallmark of a great pinball game is great sound effects, and this game 
doesn’t disappoint. The sounds the ball makes when it bounces off a bumper, 
is hit with a flipper, or passes through a rollover are spot-on and authentic.
If you like pinball, we think you’ll love Pinball Crystal Caliburn II on your iPad 
mini. LittleWing (the developer) recently released an iOS version of its origi-
nal pinball hit, Tristan, which also sports realistic physics and sounds and is 
also a lot of fun.
Art Authority for iPad
We’ve already admitted to being artistically challenged, but that applies only to 
making art. We both appreciate good art as much as the next person, or even 
more. That’s why we’re so enthusiastic about Art Authority, even at $9.99.
Art Authority is like an 
art museum you hold in 
your hand; it contains 
more than 70,000 paint-
ings and sculptures 
by more than 1,000 of 
the world’s greatest 
artists. The works are 
organized into period-
specific rooms, such 
as Early (up to 1400s), 
Baroque, Romanticism, 
Modern, and American. 
In each room, the art-
works are subdivided 
by movement. For 
example, as Figure 19-4 
shows, the Modern 
room has works of 
Surrealism, Cubism, Fauvism, Dadaism, sculpture, and several more.
Figure 19-4: Exploring virtual art galleries with the iPad.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You find period overviews, movement overviews, timelines, and slideshows, 
plus a searchable index of all 1,000+ artists and separate indices for each 
room.
	
Developer Open Door Networks recently added an Art Near Me feature, 
which lets you search for art in your vicinity. And the app has artwork and 
rooms optimized for the Retina display. And the art real size feature adds the 
perspective of understanding how big or small a work really is. Video has 
also been added for hundreds of major works. If you love art, check it out.
And let us point out a kid-friendly K-12 version with more than 60,000 paint-
ings and sculptures. It costs $7.99; “inappropriate” nudity for the youngsters 
has been eliminated.
Solar Walk — Planets of the Solar System
We like to gaze at the heavens, but we often have no clue what we’re look-
ing at. This handsome animated $2.99 guide to the night sky from Vito 
Technology — refreshed to take advantage of the Retina display — will 
delight astronomy students and anyone fascinated by outer space, even if 
purists scoff that Pluto, no longer considered a planet, is included in the 
model of the solar system.
From the start, you’re 
taken on a virtual tour 
through the galaxy. You 
can search planets — 
Figure 19-5 shows 
Saturn — satellites, 
stars, and more. You 
can even travel through 
time and space with a 
time machine feature. 
Animated movies cover 
topics such as Earth’s 
cycles, solar eclipse, 
and the moon’s phases.
What’s more, the app 
can exploit 3D, pro-
vided you supply your 
own anaglyph-style 
cyan-red 3D glasses. And if you hook the iPad mini up to a 3D TV using an 
HDMI adapter (see Chapter 17), you can get a true sense of the depth and 
sheer size of the solar system in 3D, while controlling what you see on the 
screen through the iPad mini.
Figure 19-5: Learning about beautiful Saturn in Solar Walk.

341
 Chapter 19: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
Without 3D, you can use AirPlay to mirror what’s on the iPad mini screen on 
the bigger TV screen, provided you have an Apple TV.
One thing we find frustrating: Solar Walk is heavy on in-app purchases. For 
example, you’ll have to pay 99¢ to watch a movie on a solar eclipse or to 
watch an animation showing a repair of the Hubble telescope, though you 
can get a high-resolution bundle with numerous extras for $1.99.
Action Movie FX
With Action Movie FX, it’s a breeze to add big-budget Hollywood-style spe-
cial effects to video you shoot with your iPad. Action Movie FX comes from 
producer J. J. Abrams’s Bad Robot Productions, best known for TV shows 
such as Alias and Fringe and feature films including Star Trek and Super 8. We 
expected the app to be pretty good, and it is — it may well be the most fun 
app we’ve ever used to make videos with an iPad.
The free version features eight big-budget movie effects, such as missile 
attack, avalanche, and meteor from outer space, as well as phaser fight 
and photon torpedoes from Abrams’s epic theatrical release Star Trek into 
Darkness. In other words, Action Movie FX lets you add Hollywood-style 
special effects to your videos so you can “destroy” people, places, pets, and 
other stuff in a variety of fun and interesting ways.
Making a video with 
Action Movie FX couldn’t 
be easier. Just launch the 
app, select the scene you 
want to use, tap Start, 
and shoot a minimum of 
five seconds of video. It’s 
better if the footage is of 
someone or something 
that will remain still, 
unlike Bob’s dog Zeke, the 
slightly blurry miniature 
vizsla in Figure 19-6.
When you’ve finished 
filming, you can adjust 
the timing as well as 
resize and reposition 
the special effects. When you’re satisfied with your creation, your master-
piece appears after a bit of processing; you can then share it, save it to your 
camera roll, adjust its timing again, or shoot another video.
Figure 19-6: An alien bursting out of Bob’s dog.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The free effects are great, 
but we found ourselves 
wanting more and have 
purchased most of the 
ten currently ­available 
FX packs, for $0.99 
each. They’re mostly 
great, but our absolute 
favorites are the Jet 
(shown in Figure 19-7) 
and Alien Burst (refer to 
Figure 19-6).
The videos are HD, and 
look great in a text mes-
sage or an email dis-
played on any device. 
The videos look fabulous 
on your iPad mini, but 
also look surprisingly good on a bigger display such as the one on a Mac, a 
PC, or an HDTV.
Finally, you just can’t beat the price — your first eight effects are free. But 
we’re betting that you’ll like it enough to pop for one or more $0.99 FX packs. 
Either way, we’re pretty sure you’ll have as much fun as we have adding spe-
cial FX to your videos.
Facetune for iPad
You don’t really think those drop-dead gorgeous models are really that drop-
dead gorgeous, now do you? They had “work done.” And the portraits that 
show these men and women in their best light were doctored, touched-up, 
and made to look perfect.
The $3.99 Facetune app can make you look perfect, too — okay, we’ll amend 
that to say it promises to make you look better. (As Bob and Ed know, you 
have to work with what you’ve got.)
After uploading a photo or taking pictures in the app with the camera on 
your iPad, you can tap the Facetune controls shown in Figure 19-8. Facetune 
smooths wrinkles, whitens teeth, heals zits, changes the contours of your 
face, gives you a full head of hair if you’re lacking, and even defocuses the 
image to minimize imperfections in your face.

street.

When you reach per-
fection, you can save 
the finished product to 
your camera roll, share 
it by email, or post it 
on Facebook, Twitter, 
Tumblr, or Flickr.
60 Minutes
As news junkies, we 
have long appreciated 
60 Minutes, CBS’s vener-
able TV news magazine. 
CBS Interactive’s $4.99 
companion app to the 
series brings the latest 
60 Minutes segments to your iPad mini so that you can watch at your conve-
nience. The 60 Minutes Overtime segments, which provide weekly behind-the-
scenes looks at how the various stories came together, are also available.
But the best part to us 
is the Previous+ section, 
which features more 
than 250 hand-picked 
stories, covering the 
40-plus-year history of the 
show. Interview subjects 
include Coretta Scott 
King, Johnny Carson, 
Ayatollah Khomeini 
(see Figure 19-9), Jodie 
Foster, Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan, Oprah Winfrey, 
and Barack Obama.
You can search shows by 
topic (newsmakers, poli-
tics, science, business, 
sports, entertainment, nature), by decade, and by correspondent, letting you 
zero in on some of the finest work from Ed Bradley, Harry Reasoner, and Mike 
Wallace. Andy Rooney is here too, as is the famous 60 Minutes stopwatch.

Parallels Access
If you’re like most of the iPad community, you mostly use your iPad mini for 
consumption: watching movies, listening to music, playing games, and brows-
ing the web. You engage less often in productive activities on the iPad mini, 
mostly because it lacks a physical keyboard. As a result, you still schlep a 
laptop with you on the road even though you also carry the mini.
Parallels, a company best known for letting you run virtualized versions of 
Microsoft Windows on Macintosh computers, may eliminate the need to 
carry the extra machine. Its Parallels Access iPad app ties into a subscription 
service that lets you tap into your home or office PC remotely, whether it’s a 
Windows PC or a Mac.
What sets Parallels Access apart from other apps that provide remote access 
to computers is that you can get to use all the programs that reside on 
your PC or Mac, including the proprietary software that your company may 
employ. Moreover, you can interact with those applications on the tablet as if 
each were designed for the iPad mini, and even use a browser running Adobe 
Flash on the iPad mini.
You start any PC or Mac desktop application on the iPad mini from a familiar 
looking launcher screen with icons for the apps you use most often. Such a 
screen is shown in Figure 19-10. You can add or remove icons to this launcher 
screen.
Figure 19-10: Parallels Access lets you run programs on a 
Mac or PC from the iPad mini.

345
 Chapter 19: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
Parallels, as the company puts it, “applifies” PC/Mac programs so that the 
software is modified on the tablet to display iPad-style buttons for actions 
such as copy, paste, and select. And touch gestures on the iPad mini substi-
tute for mouse moves on your computer. For example, tapping is like click-
ing with a mouse; two-finger tapping is equivalent to a right-click. Hold your 
finger against the display in an Excel spreadsheet, say, and an iPad magnify-
ing glass appears.
You can use your voice to dictate text remotely onto the home or office com-
puter. And you can listen to music on the iPad that resides on your faraway 
computer, too — no, the folks back home or in the office will not hear what 
you’re hearing; the app is set up so as not to disturb them.
Parallels Access can’t completely make up for the lack of a physical keyboard 
on the iPad. But the on-screen Mac or Windows keyboards that appear in the 
app display any dedicated special keys unique to Mac or Windows keyboards.
The Parallels Access app is free to download, as is the agent program you 
must install on each Mac or PC that you choose to access. A Parallels Access 
subscription is $19.99 per year for an unlimited number of devices (iPad 
minis and iPhones running iOS 7 and higher, Android tablets and phones 
running Android 4 and higher, and Kindle Fire) and up to five computers 
(PCs running Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 and Macs running Lion, Mountain Lion, 
Mavericks, or Yosemite).

fter spending a lot of quality time with our iPad 
minis, it’s only natural that we’ve discovered more 
than a few helpful hints, tips, and shortcuts. In this 
chapter, we share our faves.
Saving Time and Keystrokes
Keyboard shortcuts are a way to have your iPad 
mini automatically type a phrase when you type the 
shortcut. For example, when we type vty followed 
by the spacebar, our iPads type Very truly yours. We 
typed a 3-letter shortcut, and our iPads replaced it with 
a 14-letter phrase in the blink of an eye. Figure 20-1 shows 
some more examples.
How long would it take you to type Dictated to and scent from my iPad; please 
blame Siri for any missed type ohs on your iPad mini’s on-screen keyboard? 
And would you type it without mistakes? It took a fraction of a second to 

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
type our shortcut for this 
phrase (dict), and another frac-
tion of a second for the iPad 
to expand it (to Dictated to 
and scent from my iPad; please 
blame Siri for any missed type 
ohs).
So, shortcuts save you time and 
keystrokes.
Another advantage is that you’ll 
always spell things correctly (as 
long as you spell them correctly 
when you create the shortcut 
and phrase). You can even use 
shortcuts to automatically 
correct the spelling of words 
you commonly mistype. Say you often type taht when you mean to type that. 
Here’s how to create, edit, and enjoy your iPad mini’s convenient little key-
stroke savers. Start by creating a shortcut:
	
1.	Tap Settings➪General➪Keyboard.
	
2.	Tap Add New Shortcut.
	
3.	Type the phrase and the shortcut you want to trigger it.
	
4.	Tap Save.
After you create a shortcut, just 
tap its name to change (edit) it.
After you create and edit ’em, 
here’s how you use ’em:
To insert a phrase, type its key-
board shortcut. Say the short-
cut is cty, which is one of the 
shortcuts shown in Figure 20-1. 
If you stop after you type y, the 
phrase appears in the middle of 
the QuickType suggestions, as 
shown in Figure 20-2. To insert 
the phrase, press Return or 
the space bar, type a punctua-
tion mark after the y, or tap the 
QuickType suggestion; to ignore 
it, just continue typing.
Figure 20-1: Here are some shortcuts and phrases we’ve created.
Figure 20-2: Type a space, a punctuation mark, or press Return 
to insert the phrase, “I’ll call or text you as soon as I am free.”

349
 Chapter 20: Ten Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
One last thing: You can use the same technique to create keyboard short-
cuts like this on an iPhone or iPod touch. Although you can’t easily sync or 
share your shortcuts, you can create and use them on any device running 
iOS 5 or later.
Autocorrecting
Here are three related tips about autocorrection that can also help you type 
faster and more accurately.
Auto-apostrophes are good for you
First, know that you can type dont to get to don’t, and cant to get to can’t. 
We’ve told you to put some faith in the iPad’s autocorrection software, and 
that advice applies to contractions. In other words, save time by letting the 
iPad’s intelligent keyboard insert the apostrophes on your behalf for these 
and other common words.
	
We’re aware of at least one exception. The iPad can’t distinguish between it’s 
and its. (It’s is the contraction of it is, and its is the possessive adjective and 
possessive pronoun.) So if you need emails to be grammatically correct, 
remember that autocorrection doesn’t get it (or it’s or its) right all the time.
In a similar vein, if you ever need to type an apostrophe (for example, 
when you want to type it’s), you don’t need to visit the punctuation and 
numeric keyboard. Instead, press down on the exclamation mark/comma 
key until a blue apostrophe appears on the key, and then lift your finger. 
Presto — you’ve typed an apostrophe without switching to the punctuation 
and numeric keyboard and back.
Make rejection work for you
If the autocorrection suggestion isn’t the word you want, instead of ignoring 
it, reject it. Finish typing the word and then tap the x to reject the sugges-
tion before you type another word. Doing so makes your iPad more likely to 
accept your word the next time you type it and less likely to make the same 
incorrect suggestion again.
	
If you’re using a physical keyboard (for example, Apple’s keyboard dock or 
any Bluetooth wireless one), you can reject an autosuggestion by pressing 
the Esc key.
Here you thought you were buying a tech book, and you get grammar and 
typing lessons thrown in at no extra charge. Just think of us as full-service 
authors.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you hate autocorrect, turn it off
Some people don’t care for autocorrect and turn it off. If you hate it too, 
here’s how to get rid of it: Tap Settings➪General➪Keyboard and tap the Auto-
Correction switch to off (green).
	
Settings➪General➪Keyboard is also where you enable or disable other 
keyboard-related options, including Auto-Capitalization, Check Spelling, 
Enable Caps Lock, Predictive Typing, and the “double-tapping the space bar 
will insert a period followed by a space” shortcut. See Chapter 15, where we 
dive into settings.
Viewing the iPad mini’s Capacity
When your iPad mini is selected in iTunes, you see a colorful chart at the 
bottom of the screen that tells you how your media and other data use your 
iPad mini’s capacity.
By default, the chart shows the amount of free space on your iPad mini, along 
with colored bands that represent the audio, video, photo, apps, documents, 
books, and such on your iPad mini. What you may not know is that when you 
hover your pointer over the chart, an overlay appears with the number of 
Assault on batteries
Because this is a chapter of tips and hints, we’d 
be remiss if we didn’t include some ways that 
you can extend your battery life. First and fore-
most: If you use a carrying case, charging the 
iPad while it’s in that case may generate more 
heat than is healthy for both battery capacity 
and battery life. So take the iPad out of the case 
before you charge it. The smart cover isn’t a 
case, so if you use one, you’re good to go.
If you’re not using power-thirsty 3G, 4G, or 
Wi-Fi networks or a Bluetooth device (such as 
a headset), consider turning off the features you 
don’t need in Settings. Doing so could mean the 
difference between running out of juice and 
seeing the end of a movie.
Activate auto-brightness so that the screen 
brightness adjusts based on current lighting 
conditions. Using this setting can be easier on 
your battery. Tap Settings➪Brightness, and 
then tap the on/off switch, if necessary, to turn 
it on.
Turn off Location Services (tap Settings➪ 
Location Services) globally or for individual 
apps with the on/off switches. Figuring out your 
precise location takes its toll on your battery, so 
you may want to disable Location Services for 
apps you don’t use often.
Push notifications are notorious juice-suckers 
as well. Disable them (tap Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars➪Fetch New Data➪Push 
On/Off switch) and watch your battery 
life improve dramatically. You can dis-
able push notifications for other apps via 
Settings➪Notifications.

items of that type that are stored on 
your iPad mini, and how much space 
those items consume in megabytes 
(MB) or gigabytes (GB), as shown in 
Figure 20-3 for books.
Scrubbing Audio
Here’s the situation: You’re listening to a podcast or an audiobook and trying 
to find the beginning of a specific segment by moving the scrubber bar — the 
little red line representing the playhead — left and right. The only problem is 
that the scrubber bar isn’t precise, and your fat finger keeps moving it too far 
one way or the other. Never fear — your iPad has a wonderful (albeit some-
what hidden) fix. Just press your finger on the scrubber, but instead of sliding 
your finger to the left or right, slide it downward toward the bottom of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 20-4.
Figure 20-4: Press the scrubber bar, and slide your finger  
downward to change the scrubbing rate.
Figure 20-3: Hover over the colorful chart, and 
you’ll see the details in an overlay.

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
As you slide downward, the scrubbing speed changes like magic, and the 
scrubber bar moves in finer and finer increments. The speed is displayed 
below the scrubber bar (the figure displays quarter-speed scrubbing). Slide 
your finger downward an inch or until you see High-Speed Scrubbing, which 
is about 75 percent of the normal scrubbing speed. Continue dragging 
downward in 1-inch increments or so and the speed changes to half-speed, 
quarter-speed, and very fine scrubbing.
This scrub trick is easier to do than to explain, so give it a try.
Working with Links and Email Addresses
When the iPad encounters an email address (such as yourname@yourmail 
host.com) or a URL (such as http://www.websitename.com or www.
websitename.com) in an email message, it makes that text appear as a blue 
link on your screen. If you tap that link, the iPad 
launches Safari or Mail, and starts a new email 
message for an email address or takes you to the 
appropriate web page for a URL. So don’t bother 
with copy and paste if you don’t have to — tap 
those blue links, and the right thing will happen 
every time.
Here’s another cool Safari trick: If you press and 
hold down on a link rather than tapping it, a little 
floating text bubble appears and shows you the 
underlying URL. In addition, it offers the following 
options, as shown in Figure 20-5:
	
✓	Open: Opens the page.
	
✓	Open in New Tab: Opens the page while stashing the current page in 
one of the nine available tabs, as we describe in Chapter 4.
	
✓	Add to Reading List: Adds the page to your reading list, as we describe 
in Chapter 4.
	
✓	Copy: Copies the URL to the Clipboard (so that you can paste it in an 
email message, save it in Notes, or whatever).
	
You see the underlying URL and open and copy options when you press and 
hold down on a URL in Mail as well. Having this information in Mail is even 
more useful because it enables you to spot bogus links without switching to 
Safari or visiting the URL.
Here’s one more Safari trick: If you press and hold down on most images, a 
Save Image option appears (see Figure 20-6). Tap Save Image, and the picture 
is saved to the camera roll on the Albums tab of the Photos app. Tap Copy, and 
Figure 20-5: Press down on a 
link to find additional actions 
you can take.

the image is copied to the Clipboard so that you 
can paste it into an email message or document 
created in another app (such as Apple’s Pages 
or Keynote). Note that if the image is a link to 
another web page, you’ll see these options: Open, 
Open in New Tab, Add to Reading List, and Copy.
Sharing the Love . . . and the Links
	
	 Ever stumble onto a web page that you just have 
to share with a buddy? The iPad makes sharing 
dead simple. From the site in question, tap the 
share icon (shown in the margin). Then tap the 
Message, Mail, Twitter, or Facebook option to 
share the link via email, share the link via iMes-
sage, post it to your Twitter stream, or share it on 
Facebook, respectively, as shown in Figure 20-7. 
With iOS 8 and any iPad mini, you can also use 
AirDrop to share your link with other iOS 7, iOS 8, 
or Mac OS X Yosemite users, as described in 
Chapter 13.
Type a short message body (or don’t), supply 
your pal’s email or iMessage address if necessary, 
and then tap the Send or Post button.
Choosing a Home Page for Safari
You may have noticed that the iPad version of Safari, unlike the Mac and PC 
versions of Safari (as well as every other common web browser), doesn’t 
have an option to specify a home page. Instead, when you tap the Safari icon, 
you return to the last site you visited.
You can, however, create a web clip, or an icon for the page you want to use 
as your home page. Here’s how to do it:
	
1.	Open the web page you want to use as your home page.
	
	
2.	Tap the share icon (shown in the margin).
	
3.	Tap Add to Home Screen.
	
	 An icon that will open this page appears on your Home screen (or one of 
your Home screens if you have more than one).
	
4.	Tap the new web clip icon instead of the Safari icon.
	
	 Safari opens to your home page instead of the last page you visited.

You can even drag your home page icon to the dock, as shown in Figure 20-8.
Consider moving the Safari icon from the dock 
to one of your Home screens so that you never 
tap it by accident. Finally, remember that the 
dock has room for six icons, even though it has 
only four by default.
Storing Files
A tiny Massachusetts software company — Ecamm Network — sells a piece 
of OS X software, PhoneView ($29.95), which lets you copy files from your 
Mac to your iPad mini and copy files from the iPad mini to a Mac, as shown 
in Figure 20-9. (No Windows version is available.) Better still, you can try the 
program for a week before deciding whether you want to buy it. Go to www.
ecamm.com to fetch the free demo.
Figure 20-9: Store all your files with PhoneView.
The big deal here is that while automatic backups protect most of the files on 
your iPad mini, you can’t manipulate them. They’re backed up and restored, 
but heaven help you if you want to extract one or more individual iMessages, 
specific songs, videos, notes, or other types of data from your iPad mini. The 
bottom line is that there’s no easier way than PhoneView.
Figure 20-8: The BobLeVitus.TV 
Show icon now appears to the 
left of Safari in the dock.

 Chapter 20: Ten Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
In a nutshell, here’s how PhoneView works. After downloading the software 
to your Mac, double-click the program’s icon to start it. Then do one of the 
following:
	
✓	To transfer files and folders to the iPad mini: Assuming that you have 
room on the device, click the Copy to iPad button on the toolbar and 
then select the files you want to copy. The files are copied into the 
appropriate folder on the iPad mini. Alternatively, you can drag files and 
folders from the Mac desktop or a folder into the PhoneView browser.
	
✓	To go the other way and copy files from your iPad mini to your com-
puter: Highlight the files or folders you want to be copied and then click 
the Copy from iPad button on the toolbar. Select the destination on your 
Mac where you want to store the files, and then click Save. You can also 
drag files and folders from the PhoneView file browser to the Mac desk-
top or folder. Or you can double-click a file in the PhoneView browser to 
download it to your Mac’s Documents folder.
If you need access to the files on your iPad mini or if you want to use your 
iPad mini as a pseudo–hard drive, PhoneView is a bargain.
	
Bob says: “I use Printopia, also from Ecamm ($19.95), to print from my iPads 
to several of our non-AirPrint printers. It works great and costs a lot less than 
a new AirPrint-enabled printer.”
Making Phone Calls
Many people, including us, have compared the iPad to an iPhone on steroids. 
Only the iPad isn’t actually a phone. But don’t let that stop you from making 
or even receiving phone calls on the tablet.
Come again?
You read right. You can make and even receive phone calls on your iPad 
mini. After all, two of the key components to calling are built into the iPad: a 
speaker and a microphone.
If you have an iPhone 5 or newer and any iPad mini and both devices are run-
ning iOS 8 or later, you have everything you need. To make a phone call on 
your iPad, just tap a phone number in Contacts, Calendar, or Safari, or tap a 
recent contact in the multitasking screen.
If you meet the requirements and still can’t make calls, go to Settings➪FaceTime 
and turn on iPhone Cellular Calls. Conversely, if you hate this feature and want 
to disable it, go to Settings➪FaceTime and turn off iPhone Cellular Calls.

356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
But wait! There’s more! You can make and receive calls even if your devices 
aren’t the latest and greatest. Just head to the App Store to fetch the third 
component: Instead of an iPhone, you’ll need an app that takes advantage of 
VOIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol. In plain-speak, that means turning the iPad 
into a giant iPhone. And yes, you can find more than one app to do the trick.
We’ve checked out Line2, Skype, and Truphone, all of which have a version 
designed to take advantage of the large iPad screen. The apps themselves 
are free, although you have to pay for calls to regular phones. Here are the 
details:
	
✓	Line2: We especially like Line2, although it costs $9.95 per month. It can 
receive calls through Wi-Fi or a cellular data network (if you have an 
iPad mini with 3G or 4G). It boasts such features as visual voicemail (like 
the iPhone) and conference calling. And it taps right into your iPad mini 
contacts list.
	
✓	Skype: Skype’s app permits free Skype-to-Skype calls, instant messages, 
and video chats; calls to regular phones around the world cost pennies 
per minute.
	
✓	Truphone: This app permits free Wi-Fi calls to Truphone and Google 
Talk users. Other rates are cheap.
Snapping the Screen
True confession: We threw in this final tip because, well, it helps people like 
us. Permit us to explain. We hope you’ve admired the pictures of the iPad 
mini screens that are sprinkled throughout this book. We also secretly hope 
that you’re thinking what marvelous photographers we must be.
Well, the fact is, we couldn’t take a blurry picture of the iPad using its built-in 
(and little-known) screen-grab feature if we wanted to.
Press the sleep/wake button at the same time you press the Home button, but 
just for an instant. The iPad mini grabs a snapshot of whatever is on the screen.
The picture lands in the camera roll of the Photos app. From there, you can 
synchronize it with your Mac or PC, along with all your other pictures, or 
email it to yourself or anyone else. And from there, the possibilities are end-
less. Why, your picture could wind up just about anywhere, including in a For 
Dummies book.
	
You can also use an HDTV to show what’s happening on your iPad mini’s 
screen in real time. To see on an HDTV the content on your iPad mini’s 
screen, you need a television that has at least one HDMI port and either 
Apple’s Digital AV adapter for iPads ($39 for 30-pin connector; $49 for 
Lightning connector), or an Apple TV ($99).

About the Authors
Edward C. Baig writes the Personal Technology column in USA TODAY, is 
a regular on USA TODAY podcasts and videos, and makes frequent media 
appearances. Ed is also the author of Macs For Dummies, 11th Edition (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.) and cowriter of iPhone For Dummies, 8th Edition. Before 
joining USA TODAY as a columnist and reporter in 1999, Ed spent six years at 
Business Week, where he wrote and edited stories about consumer tech, per-
sonal finance, collectibles, travel, and wine tasting, among other topics. He 
received the Medill School of Journalism 1999 Financial Writers and Editors 
Award for contributions to the Business Week “Investor Guide to Online 
Investing.” That followed a three-year stint at U.S. News & World Report, 
where Ed was the lead tech writer for the News You Can Use section and also 
dabbled in numerous other subjects.
Ed began his journalist career at Fortune magazine, gaining the best basic 
training imaginable during his early years as a fact checker and contributor 
to the Fortune 500. Through the dozen years he worked at the magazine, 
Ed ­covered leisure-time industries, penned features on the lucrative dating 
market and the effect of religion on corporate managers, and was ­heavily 
involved in the Most Admired Companies project. Ed also started up Fortune’s 
Products to Watch column, a venue for low- and high-tech items.
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or cowritten over 70 
popular computer books, with millions of copies in print. His titles include 
OS X Yosemite For Dummies, iPhone For Dummies, Incredible iPhone Apps For 
Dummies, and Microsoft Office 2011 For Mac For Dummies, all for John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc.
For more than 15 years, Bob has penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the 
Houston Chronicle. He’s been published in pretty much every magazine that 
ever had the word Mac in its title, and his achievements have been docu-
mented in major media around the world. (Yes, that was Bob juggling a key-
board in USA TODAY a few years back!)
Bob is known for his expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to 
translate techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. Bob is 
also a prolific public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo train-
ing sessions in the United States and abroad, keynote addresses in three 
countries, and Macintosh training seminars in many U.S. cities.
Dedications
I dedicate this book to my beautiful wife, Janie, for inspiring me in myriad 
ways every day I am with her. And to my incredible kids: my adorable little 
girl, Sydney (one of her first words was iPod), my little boy, Sammy (who 
asks to use his iPad the moment he wakes up in the morning), and my canine 
daughter Sadie (who thankfully hasn’t chewed on the iPad yet). This book is 

dedicated also to the memory of my canine son, Eddie, Jr., and my late par-
ents, Samuel and Lucille Baig. I am madly in love with you all.
— Ed Baig
Every book I’ve ever written and every book I will ever write is dedicated to 
the most awesome wife in the world, Lisa. For the last thirty-one years, she 
has taught me more about everything I know than anyone else on Earth.
Every book I’ve written or will ever write is also dedicated to my two terrific 
(adult) kids, Allison and Jacob, who love their iPhones, iPads, and Macs almost 
as much as their dad loves them (the devices, not the kids).
— Bob LeVitus
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Special thanks to everyone at Apple who helped us turn this book around 
so quickly: Natalie Kerris, Teresa Brewer, Trudy Muller, Keri Walker, Andy 
Bowman, Christine Monaghan, and everyone else who lent a hand from the 
mother ship in Cupertino. We couldn’t have done it without you and apolo-
gize to anyone we left out.
Big-time thanks to the gang at Wiley: Susan “The Power’s Out Again” Pink, 
Andy “The Boss” Cummings, our incredible technical editor Jim Kelly, whose 
suggestions and observations helped immensely (even the ones we ignored), 
and our invaluable proofreader, Debbye Butler, who did a tremendous job. 
Finally, thanks to everyone at Wiley we don’t know by name. If you helped 
with this project in any way, you have our everlasting thanks.
Ed adds: Thanks to my agent, Matt Wagner, who had the right instinct to 
push this book, even back when we were calling the first edition of this book 
Project X For Dummies. I’d also like to thank Nancy Blair, Jefferson Graham, Eli 
Blumenthal, and all my USA TODAY friends and colleagues for your continuing 
support and encouragement of such projects. Most of all, thanks to my loving 
family for understanding my nightly (and weekend) disappearances as we 
raced to get this project completed on time. You are quite simply the greatest.
And Bob says: Extra special thanks to Carole “Swifty” Jelen of Waterside 
Productions, my literary agent for more than 25 years. I don’t say this often 
enough: You freakin’ rock, Swifty!
