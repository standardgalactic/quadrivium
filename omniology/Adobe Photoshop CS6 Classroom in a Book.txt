web. And throughout this edition, look for tips and techniques from one of Adobe’s 
own experts, Photoshop evangelist Julieanne Kost. 
What’s in Photoshop extended
This edition of Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book works with the 3D 
features in Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended—a version with additional functions 
for professional, technical, and scientific users, intended for those creating special 
effects in video or in architectural, scientific, or engineering images. 
Photoshop Extended features include: 
• The ability to import 3D images and to edit individual frames or image sequence 
files by painting, cloning, retouching, or transforming them.
• Support for 3D files including the U3D, 3DS, OBJ, KMZ, and Collada file 
formats created by programs such as Adobe Acrobat® 9 Professional and Google 
Earth. See Lesson 12, “Working with 3D Images,” to learn about these features.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 3
• Support for specialized file formats, such as DICOM, the most common 
standard for receiving medical scans; MATLAB, a high-level technical 
computing language and interactive environment for developing algorithms, 
visualizing and analyzing data, and computing numbers; and 32-bit high-
resolution images, including a special HDR Color Picker and the capability to 
paint and layer these 32-bit HDR images. 
Prerequisites
Before you begin to use Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book, you should 
have a working knowledge of your computer and its operating system. Make sure 
that you know how to use the mouse and standard menus and commands, and 
also how to open, save, and close files. If you need to review these techniques, see 
the documentation included with your Microsoft® Windows® or Apple® Mac® OS X 
documentation.
Installing adobe Photoshop
Before you begin using Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book, make sure that  
your system is set up correctly and that you’ve installed the required software and 
hardware. You must purchase the Adobe Photoshop CS6 software separately. For  
system requirements and complete instructions on installing the software, see the 
Adobe Photoshop CS6 Read Me file on the application DVD or on the web at  
www.adobe.com/support. Note that some Photoshop CS6 Extended features, 
including all 3D features, require a video card that supports OpenGL 2.0.
Photoshop and Bridge use the same installer. You must install these applications 
from the Adobe Photoshop CS6 application DVD (you cannot run the programs 
from the disc), or from the installation files you downloaded from Adobe, onto your 
hard drive. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Make sure that your serial number is accessible before installing the application.

As you work with Adobe Photoshop, you’ll discover 
that you can often accomplish the same task in 
several ways. To make the best use of the extensive 
editing capabilities in Photoshop, you must first learn 
to navigate the work area.

10 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
starting to work in adobe Photoshop 
The Adobe Photoshop work area includes menus, toolbars, and panels that give  
you quick access to a variety of tools and options for editing and adding elements  
to your image. You can also add commands and filters to the menus by installing  
third-party software known as plug-ins.
Photoshop works with bitmapped, digitized images (that is, continuous-tone images 
that have been converted into a series of small squares, or picture elements, called 
pixels). You can also work with vector graphics, which are drawings made of smooth 
lines that retain their crispness when scaled. You can create original artwork in 
Photoshop, or you can import images from many sources, such as:
• Photographs from a digital camera
• Commercial CDs of digital images
• Scans of photographs, transparencies, negatives, graphics, or other documents
• Captured video images
• Artwork created in drawing programs
starting Photoshop and opening a file
To begin, you’ll start Adobe Photoshop and reset the default preferences.
1 On the desktop, double-click the Adobe Photoshop icon to start Adobe 
Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows)  
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to reset the default settings. 
If you don’t see the Photoshop icon on your desktop, choose Start >  
All Programs > Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows) or look in either the  
Applications folder or the Dock (Mac OS).
2 When prompted, click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the Adobe 
Photoshop Settings file.
 Note: Typically, 
you won’t need to 
reset defaults when 
you’re working on 
your own projects. 
However, you’ll reset 
the preferences before 
working on each 
lesson in this book to 
ensure that what you 
see onscreen matches 
the descriptions in 
the lessons. For more 
information, see 
“Restoring default 
preferences” on page 4.

The default workspace in Photoshop consists of the menu bar and options bar 
at the top of the screen, the Tools panel on the left, and several open panels 
in the panel dock on the right. When you have documents open, one or more 
image windows also appear, and you can display them at the same time using the 
tabbed interface. The Photoshop user interface is very similar to the one in Adobe 
Illustrator®, Adobe InDesign®, and Adobe Flash®—so learning how to use the tools 
and panels in one application means that you’ll know how to use them in the 
others.

arrangement is similar 
on Windows, but 
operating system  
styles may vary.

12 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
There is one main difference between the Photoshop work area on Windows and 
that on Mac OS: On Mac OS, you can work with an application frame, which con-
tains the Photoshop application’s windows and panels within a frame that is distinct 
from other applications you may have open; only the menu bar is outside the appli-
cation frame. The application frame is enabled by default; to disable the application 
frame, choose Window > Application Frame. 
On Mac OS, the application frame keeps the image, panels, and menu bar together.
3 Choose File > Open, and navigate to the Lessons/Lesson01 folder that you copied 
to your hard drive from the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD. 
4 Select the 01A_End.psd file, and click Open. 
Click OK if you see the Embedded Profile 
Mismatch dialog box.
The 01A_End.psd file opens in its own window, 
called the image window. The end files in this book 
show you what you are creating in each project. 
In this file, an image of a vintage car has been 
enhanced without overexposing the headlight.
5 Choose File > Close, or click the close button  
on the title bar of the image window. (Do not 
close Photoshop.)

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 13
Opening a file with adobe Bridge
In this book, you’ll work with different start files in each lesson. You may make  
copies of these files and save them under different names or locations, or you may 
work from the original start files and then copy them from the DVD again if you 
want a fresh start. This lesson includes three start files.
In the previous exercise, you used the Open command to open a file. Now you’ll 
open another file using Adobe Bridge, a visual file browser that helps take the 
guesswork out of finding the image file that you need.
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge. If you’re prompted to enable the Photoshop 
extension in Bridge, click OK.
Adobe Bridge opens, displaying a collection of panels, menus, and buttons.
2 Select the Folders tab in the upper left corner, and then browse to the Lessons 
folder you copied from the DVD onto your hard disk. The Lessons folder 
appears in the Content panel.
3 Select the Lessons folder, and choose File > Add To Favorites. Adding files, 
folders, application icons, and other assets that you use often to the Favorites 
panel lets you access them quickly.
4 Select the Favorites tab to open the panel, and click the Lessons folder to open 
it. Then, in the Content panel, double-click the Lesson01 folder.
Thumbnail previews of the folder contents appear in the Content panel.

14 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
5 Double-click the 01A_Start.psd thumbnail in the Content panel to open the file, 
or select the thumbnail and choose File > Open.
The 01A_Start.psd image opens in Photoshop. Leave Bridge open; you’ll use it to 
locate and open files later in this lesson.
using the tools
Photoshop provides an integrated set of tools for producing sophisticated graphics 
for print, web, and mobile viewing. We could easily fill the entire book with details 
on the wealth of Photoshop tools and tool configurations. While that would cer-
tainly be a useful reference, it’s not the goal of this book. Instead, you’ll start gaining 
experience by configuring and using a few tools on a sample project. Every lesson 
will introduce you to more tools and ways to use them. By the time you finish all 
the lessons in this book, you’ll have a solid foundation for further explorations of 
the Photoshop toolset. 
selecting and using a tool from the tools panel
The Tools panel is the long, narrow panel on the far left side of the work area. 
It contains selection tools, painting and editing tools, foreground- and background-
color selection boxes, and viewing tools.
You’ll start by using the Zoom tool, which also appears in many other Adobe appli-
cations, including Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat.
 Note: For a com-
plete list of the tools in 
the Tools panel, see the 
Tools panel overview at 
the end of this lesson.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 15
1 Click the double arrows just above the Tools panel to toggle to a double-column 
view. Click the arrow again to return to a single-column Tools panel and use 
your screen space more efficiently.
2 Examine the status bar at the bottom of the work area (Windows) or image 
window (Mac OS), and notice the percentage that appears on the far left. This 
represents the current enlargement view of the image, or zoom level.
3 Move the pointer over the Tools panel, and hover it over the magnifying-glass 
icon until a tool tip appears. The tool tip displays the tool’s name (Zoom tool) 
and keyboard shortcut (Z).
Zoom level
Status bar
4 Click the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, or press Z to select it. 
5 Move the pointer over the image window. The pointer now looks like a tiny 
magnifying glass with a plus sign in the center of the glass ( ).
6 Click anywhere in the image window.
The image enlarges to a preset percentage level, which replaces the previous value 
in the status bar. The location you clicked when you used the Zoom tool is centered 
in the enlarged view. If you click again, the zoom advances to the next preset level, 
up to a maximum of 3200%.
7 Hold down the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac OS) so that the Zoom 
tool pointer appears with a minus sign in the center of the magnifying glass ( ), 
and then click anywhere in the image. Then release the Alt or Option key.

16 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
Now the view zooms out to a lower preset magnification, so that you can see more 
of the image, but in less detail. 
8 If Scrubby Zoom is selected in the options bar, click anywhere on the image and 
drag the Zoom tool to the right. The image enlarges. Drag the Zoom tool to the 
left to zoom out. When Scrubby Zoom is selected, you can drag the Zoom tool 
across the image to zoom in and out.
9 Deselect Scrubby Zoom in the options bar if it’s selected. Then, using the 
Zoom tool, drag a rectangle to enclose the area of the image that includes the 
headlight.
The image enlarges so that the area you enclosed in your rectangle now fills the 
entire image window. 
You have now used four methods with the Zoom tool to change the magnification 
in the image window: clicking, holding down a keyboard modifier while clicking, 
dragging to zoom in and out, and dragging to define a magnification area. Many 
of the other tools in the Tools panel can be used with keyboard combinations and 
options, as well. You’ll have opportunities to use these techniques in various lessons 
in this book.
selecting and using a hidden tool
Photoshop has many tools you can use to edit image files, but you will probably 
work with only a few of them at a time. The Tools panel arranges some of the tools 
in groups, with only one tool shown for each group. The other tools in the group 
are hidden behind that tool.
A small triangle in the lower right corner of a button is your clue that other tools 
are available but hidden under that tool.
 Note: Scrubby 
Zoom is available 
only if Use Graphics 
Processor is enabled 
in the Performance 
panel of the Photoshop 
Preferences dialog 
box. (Choose 
Edit > Preferences > 
Performance 
or Photoshop > 
Preferences > 
Performance to open 
the dialog box.)
 Note: You can use 
other methods to zoom 
in and out. For example, 
when the Zoom tool  
is selected, you can 
select the Zoom In  
or Zoom Out mode on 
the options bar. You can 
choose View > Zoom 
In or View > Zoom Out. 
Or, you can type a new 
percentage in the status 
bar and press Enter 
or Return.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 17
1 Position the pointer over the second tool from the top in the Tools panel until 
the tool tip appears. The tool tip identifies the Rectangular Marquee tool ( ) 
with the keyboard shortcut M. Select that tool.
2 Select the Elliptical Marquee tool (
), which is hidden behind the Rectangular 
Marquee tool, using one of the following methods:
• Press and hold the mouse button 
over the Rectangular Marquee tool 
to open the pop-up list of hidden 
tools, and select the Elliptical 
Marquee tool.
• Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the tool button in the  
Tools panel to cycle through the hidden marquee tools until the Elliptical  
Marquee tool is selected.
• Press Shift+M, which switches between the Rectangular and Elliptical 
Marquee tools.
3 Move the pointer over the image window, to the upper left side of the head-
light. When the Elliptical Marquee tool is selected, the pointer becomes  
cross-hairs (+). 
4 Drag the pointer down and to the right to 
draw an ellipse around the headlight, and 
then release the mouse button.
An animated dashed line indicates that the 
area inside it is selected. When you select 
an area, it becomes the only editable area 
of the image. The area outside the selection 
is protected. 
5 Move the pointer inside your elliptical 
selection so that the pointer appears  
as an arrow with a small rectangle ( ). 

18 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
6 Drag the selection so that it is accurately centered over the headlight.
When you drag the selection, only the selection 
border moves, not pixels in the image. When 
you want to move the pixels in the image, 
you’ll need to use a different technique. You’ll 
learn more about making different kinds of 
selections and moving the selection contents in 
Lesson 3, “Working with Selections.”
using keyboard combinations with tool actions
Many tools can operate under certain constraints. You usually activate these modes 
by holding down specific keys as you move the tool with the mouse. Some tools 
have modes that you choose in the options bar.
The next task is to make a fresh start at selecting the headlight. This time, you’ll use 
a keyboard combination that constrains the elliptical selection to a circle that you’ll 
draw from the center outward instead of from the outside inward.
1 Make sure that the Elliptical Marquee tool (
) is still selected in the Tools 
panel, and then deactivate the current selection by doing one of the following:
• In the image window, click anywhere outside the selected area.
• Choose Select > Deselect.
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS).
2 Position the pointer in the center of the 
headlight.
3 Press Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift 
(Mac OS) and drag outward from the 
center of the headlight until the circle 
completely encloses the headlight. The Shift 
key constrains the ellipse to a perfect circle.
4 Carefully release first the mouse button and 
then the keyboard keys.
If you aren’t satisfied with the selection circle, you can move it: Place the pointer 
inside the circle and drag, or click outside the selection circle to deselect it, and 
then try again.
 Note: If you 
accidentally release 
the Alt or Option key 
prematurely, the tool 
reverts to its normal 
behavior (drawing from 
the edge). If you haven’t 
yet released the mouse 
button, you can just 
press the key again, and 
the selection changes 
back. If you have 
released the mouse 
button, simply start 
again at step 1.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 19
5 Select the Zoom tool, and then click the Fit Screen button in the options bar so 
that you can see the entire image.
Notice that the selection remains active even after you change the view. 
applying a change to a selected area
In most cases, you’d change the area within the selec-
tion. But in order to spotlight the headlight, you’ll want 
to darken the rest of the image, not the area inside the 
current selection. To protect that area, you’ll invert the 
selection, so that everything but the headlight is selected 
in the image.
1 Choose Select > Inverse.
Although the animated selection border around the head-
light looks the same, notice that a similar border appears 
all around the edges of the image. Now everything in the 
image is selected except the area within the circle. The 
unselected area (the headlight) cannot be changed while 
the selection is active.
2 In the Adjustments panel, click the Curves icon to add a Curves adjustment 
layer. The Curves options appear in the Properties panel.

E Tip: The keyboard 
shortcut for this 
command, Ctrl+Shift+I 
(Windows) or 
Command+Shift+I 
(Mac OS), appears by 
the command name 
in the Select menu. In 
the future, you can just 
press that keyboard 
combination to invert  
a selection.

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
3 In the Properties panel, drag the control point in the upper right corner of the 
graph straight across to the left until the Input value is approximately 204.  
The Output value should remain 255. (If you don’t see the Input and Output 
values, drag the triangle at the lower right corner of the Properties panel to 
extend the panel downward.)
As you drag, highlights are brightened in the selected area of the image.
4 Adjust the Input value up or down until you are satisfied with the results.
5 In the Layers panel, examine the Curves 
adjustment layer. (If the Layers panel isn’t open, 
click its tab or choose Window > Layers.) 
Adjustment layers let you make changes to your 
image, such as adjusting the brightness of the high-
lights in this car, without affecting the actual pixels. 
Because you’ve used an adjustment layer, you can 
always return to the original image by hiding or 
deleting the adjustment layer—and you can edit the 
adjustment layer at any time. You’ll use adjustment  
layers in several lessons in this book.
6 Do one of the following:
• To save your changes, choose File > Save, click OK if you see the Photoshop 
Format Options dialog box, and then choose File > Close.
• To revert to the unaltered version of the file, choose File > Close, and click 
No or Don’t Save when you’re asked if you want to save your changes.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 21
• To save changes without affecting the original file, choose File > Save As, 
rename the file or save it to a different folder, and click OK. Click OK in the 
Photoshop Format Options dialog box. Then choose File > Close.
You don’t have to deselect, because closing the file cancels the selection. 
Congratulations! You’ve just finished your first Photoshop project. Although a 
Curves adjustment layer is actually one of the more sophisticated methods of  
altering an image, it isn’t difficult to use, as you have seen. You’ll learn more about 
making adjustments to images in many other lessons in this book. Lessons 2 and 6,  
in particular, address techniques like those used in classic darkroom work, such as 
adjusting for exposure, retouching, and correcting colors.
Zooming and scrolling  
with the navigator panel
The Navigator panel is another speedy way to make large changes in the zoom 
level, especially when the exact percentage of magnification is unimportant. It’s also 
a great way to scroll around in an image, because the thumbnail shows you exactly 
what part of the image appears in the image window. To open the Navigator panel, 
choose Window > Navigator.
The slider under the image thumbnail in the Navigator panel enlarges the image 
when you drag to the right (toward the large mountain icon) and reduces it when 
you drag to the left.
The red rectangular outline represents the area of the image that appears in the 
image window. When you zoom in far enough that the image window shows only 
part of the image, you can drag the red outline around the thumbnail area to see 
other areas of the image. This is also an excellent way to verify which part of an 
image you’re working on when you work at very high zoom levels.

22 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
using the options bar and other panels
You’ve already had some experience with the options bar. When you selected the 
Zoom tool in the previous project, you saw that the options bar contained options 
that change the view of the current image window. Now you’ll learn more about  
setting tool properties in the options bar, as well as using panels and panel menus.
Previewing and opening another file
The next project involves a promotional postcard for a community project. First, 
preview the end file to see what you’re aiming to do.
1 Click the Mini Bridge tab at the bottom of the application window to open the

You can access many of the features of Adobe Bridge without leaving Photoshop. 
The Mini Bridge panel lets you browse, select, open, and import files while you’re 
working with your image in Photoshop.
2 Choose Favorites from the pop-up menu on the left side of the panel. Then 
double-click the Lessons folder, and double-click the Lesson01 folder.
3 Select the 01B_End.psd file in the Content area, and press the spacebar to see  
a full-screen preview of the image.

setting tool properties in the options bar 
With the 01B_Start.psd file open in Photoshop, you’re ready to select the text prop-
erties and then to type your message.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Horizontal Type tool ( ).
The buttons and menus in the options bar now relate to the Type tool.
2 In the options bar, select a font you like from the first pop-up menu. (We used 
Garamond, but you can use another font if you prefer.)
3 Specify 38 pt for the font size. 
You can specify 38 points by typing directly in the font-size text box and pressing 
Enter or Return, or by scrubbing the font-size menu label. You can also choose a 
standard font size from the font-size pop-up menu.

E Tip: You can place 
the pointer over the 
labels of most numeric 
settings in the tool 
options bar, in panels, 
and in dialog boxes in 
Photoshop to display 
a “scrubby slider.” 
Dragging the pointing-
finger slider to the right 
increases the value; 
dragging to the left 
decreases the value. 
Alt-dragging (Windows) 
or Option-dragging 
(Mac OS) changes 
the values in smaller 
increments; Shift-
dragging changes them 
in larger increments.

4 Click once anywhere on the left side of the image, and type Monday is Beach 
Cleanup Day.
The text appears with the font and font size that you selected. 
5 In the Tools panel, select the Move tool (
). It’s the first tool.
6 Position the Move tool pointer over the text you typed, and drag the text onto 
the sand, centering it over the bench.
using panels and panel menus
The text color in your image is the same as the Foreground Color swatch in the 
Tools panel, which is black by default. The text in the end-file example was a 
magenta shade that made the text stand out. You’ll color the text by selecting it  
and then choosing another color.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Horizontal Type tool ( ).
2 Drag the Horizontal Type tool across the text to select all the words. 
3 Click the Swatches tab to bring that panel forward, if it’s not already visible.
4 Select any swatch. 
The color you select appears in three places: as the Foreground Color in the Tools 
panel, in the text color swatch in the options bar, and in the text you selected in the 
image window. (Select any other tool in the Tools panel to deselect the text so that 
you can see the color applied to it.)
 Note: Don’t select 
the Move tool using the 
V keyboard shortcut, 
because you’re in text-
entry mode. Typing 
V will add the letter 
to your text in the 
image window.
 Note: When you 
move the pointer 
over the swatches, it 
temporarily changes 
into an eyedropper. 
Set the tip of the 
eyedropper on the 
swatch you want, and 
click to select it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 25
That’s how easy it is to select a color, although there are other methods in 
Photoshop. However, you’ll use a specific color for this project, and it’s easier  
to find it if you change the Swatches panel display.
5 Select another tool in the Tools panel, such as the Move tool (
), to deselect the 
Horizontal Type tool. Then, click the menu button (
) on the Swatches panel to 
open the panel menu, and choose Small List. 
6 Select the Type tool and reselect the text, as you did in steps 1 and 2.
7 In the Swatches panel, scroll about halfway 
down the list to find the Pastel Violet Magenta 
swatch, and then select it.
Now the text appears in the lighter violet color.
8 Select the Hand tool ( ) to deselect the text. Then click the Default  
Foreground And Background Colors button in the Tools panel to 
make Black the foreground color.
Resetting the default colors does not change the color of the text in the image, 
because that text is no longer selected.

Getting to know the Work Area
9 You’ve finished the task, so close the file. You can either save it, close it without 
saving, or save it under a different name or location.
It’s as simple as that—you’ve completed another project. Nice job!
undoing actions in Photoshop
In a perfect world, you’d never make a mistake. You’d never click the wrong object. 
You’d always perfectly anticipate how specific actions would bring your design 
ideas to life exactly as you imagined them. You’d never have to backtrack.
For the real world, Photoshop gives you the power to step back and undo actions so 
that you can try other options. The next project provides you with an opportunity 
to experiment freely, knowing that you can reverse the process.
This project also introduces you to layering, which is one of the fundamental and 
most powerful features in Photoshop. Photoshop includes many kinds of layers, 
some of which contain images, text, or solid colors, and others that simply interact 
with layers below them. The file for this next project has both kinds of layers. You 
don’t have to understand layers to complete this project successfully, so don’t worry 
about that right now. You’ll learn more about layers in Lesson 4, “Layer Basics,” and 
Lesson 9, “Advanced Compositing.”
undoing a single action
Even beginning computer users quickly come to appreciate the familiar Undo com-
mand. Once again, you’ll begin this project by looking at the final result.
1 Click the Mini Bridge tab to open the Mini Bridge panel again. It displays the 
contents of the Lesson01 folder.
2 Look at the thumbnails for 
the 01C_End.psd file and 
the 01C_Start.psd file. In the 
start file, the tie is solid; in 
the end file, it is patterned.
3 In the Content panel, double-
click the 01C_Start.psd file 
thumbnail to open it in 
Photoshop.
4 Double-click the Mini Bridge 
tab to close the panel.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 27
5 In the Layers panel, select the Tie Designs layer.
Notice the arrow in the Tie Designs layer in the 
Layers panel. The Tie Designs layer is a clipping 
mask. A clipping mask works somewhat like a selec-
tion in that it restricts the area of the image that can 
be altered. With the clipping mask in place, you can 
paint a design over the tie without worrying about 
any stray brush strokes disturbing the rest of the 
image. You’ve selected the Tie Designs layer because 
it’s the layer you’ll be editing now.
6 In the Tools panel, select the Brush tool (
), or press B to select it by its 
keyboard shortcut.
7 In the options bar, click the brush size to  
display brush options. Then, move the Size  
slider to 65 pixels. In the list of brushes,  
select the Soft Round Pressure Size brush.  
(The name will appear as a tool tip if you  
hover the pointer over a brush.)
If you want to try a different brush, that’s 
OK, but select a brush that’s reasonably 
close to 65 pixels—preferably between 45 
and 75 pixels.
8 Move the pointer over the image so that it appears as a circle the same diameter 
as the brush. Then draw a stripe anywhere in the orange tie. You don’t have to 
worry about staying within the lines, because the 
brush won’t paint anything outside the tie clipping 
mask.
Oops! Your stripe may be very nice, but the design 
calls for dots, so you’ll need to remove the stripe you 
just painted.
9 Choose Edit > Undo Brush Tool, or press Ctrl+Z 
(Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) to undo the 
Brush tool action.
The tie is again a solid orange color, with no stripe.

 Note: You’ll get 
more experience with 
clipping masks in 
Lesson 6, “Masks and 
Channels” and Lesson 7, 
“Typographic Design.”

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
undoing multiple actions
The Undo command reverses only one step. This is a practicality, because 
Photoshop files can be very large, and maintaining multiple Undo steps can tie 
up a lot of memory, which tends to degrade performance. You could use the Step 
Backward command to undo additional steps one at a time. However, it’s faster and 
easier to step back through multiple actions using the History panel.
1 Using the same Brush tool settings, click once over the (unstriped) orange tie to 
create a soft dot.
2 Click several more times in different areas on the tie to create a pattern of dots.
3 Choose Window > History to open the History panel. Then drag a corner of the 
History panel to resize it so that you can see more steps. 
The History panel records the recent actions you’ve performed in the image. The 
current state is selected, at the bottom of the list.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 29
4 Click an earlier action in the History panel, and notice how the image changes. 
Several actions are undone.
5 In the image window, create a new dot on the tie with the Brush tool.
Notice that the History panel has removed the dimmed actions that were listed 
after the selected history state and has added a new one.
6 Choose Edit > Undo Brush Tool or press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z 
(Mac OS) to undo the dot you created in step 5.
Now the History panel restores the earlier listing of dimmed actions.
7 Select the state at the bottom of the History panel list.
The image is restored to the condition it was in when you finished step 2 of 
this exercise.

30 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
By default, the Photoshop History panel retains only the last 20 actions. This is  
a compromise, striking a balance between flexibility and performance. You can 
change the number of levels in the History panel by choosing Edit > Preferences > 
Performance (Windows) or Photoshop > Preferences > Performance (Mac OS) and 
entering a different value for History States.
using a context menu
Context menus are short menus that contain commands and options appropriate to 
specific elements in the work area. They are sometimes referred to as “right-click” 
or “shortcut” menus. Usually, the commands on a context menu are also available 
in some other area of the user interface, but using the context menu can save time.
1 If the Brush tool (
) is not still selected in the Tools panel, select it now.
2 In the image window, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) 
anywhere in the image to open the Brush tool context menu.
Context menus vary with their context, of course, so what appears can be a menu 
of commands or a panel-like set of options, which is what happens in this case.
3 Select a finer brush, such as the Hard Round brush, and change the size to 9
pixels. You may need to scroll up or down the list in the context menu to find 
the right brush.
4 In the image window, use the selected brush to create smaller dots on the tie. 
5 As it suits you, use the Undo command and the History panel to backtrack 
through your painting actions to correct mistakes or make different choices.
6 When you finish making changes to your tie design, choose File > Save if you 
want to save your results, choose File > Save As if you want to save the file in 
another location or with a different name, or close the file without saving.
Give yourself a pat on the back for finishing another project. 
 Note: Clicking 
anywhere in the work 
area closes the context 
menu. If the tie area 
is hidden behind the 
Brush tool context 
menu, click another 
area or double-click 
your selection in the 
context menu to  
close it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 31
More about panels and panel locations
Photoshop panels are powerful and varied. Rarely would you need to see all panels 
simultaneously. That’s why they’re in panel groups, and why the default configura-
tions leave some panels unopened.
The complete list of panels appears in the Window menu, with check marks by 
the names of the panels that are open at the front of their panel groups. You 
can open a closed panel or close an open one by selecting the panel name in the 
Window menu. 
You can hide all panels at once—including the options bar and Tools panel—by 
pressing the Tab key. To reopen them, press Tab again.
You already used panels in the panel dock when you used the Layers and Swatches 
panels. You can drag panels to or from the panel dock. This is convenient for bulky 
panels or ones that you use only occasionally but want to keep handy.
You can arrange panels in other ways, as well:
• To move an entire panel group, drag the title bar to another location in the 
work area.
• To move a panel to another group, drag the panel tab into that panel group 
so that a blue highlight appears inside the group, and then release the 
mouse button.
• To dock a panel or panel group, drag the title bar or panel tab onto the top of  
the dock.
• To undock a panel or panel group so that it becomes a floating panel or panel 
group, drag its title bar or panel tab away from the dock.
 Note: When panels 
are hidden, a thin, 
semitransparent strip 
is visible at the edge 
of the document. 
Hovering the pointer 
over the strip displays 
its contents.

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
expanding and collapsing panels
You can resize panels to use screen space more efficiently and to see fewer or more 
panel options, either by dragging or clicking to toggle between preset sizes: 
• To collapse open panels to icons, click the double arrow in the title bar of the 
dock or panel group. To expand a panel, click its icon or the double arrow. 
• To change the height of a panel, drag its lower right corner. 
• To change the width of the dock, position the pointer on the left edge of the 
dock until it becomes a double-headed arrow, and then drag to the left to widen 
the dock, or to the right to narrow it.
• To resize a floating panel, move the pointer over the right, left, or bottom edge 
of the panel until it becomes a double-headed arrow, and then drag the edge in 
or out. You can also pull the lower right corner in or out.
• To collapse a panel group so that only the dock header bar and tabs are visible, 
double-click a panel tab or panel title bar. Double-click again to restore it to the 
expanded view. You can open the panel menu even when the panel is collapsed.
Notice that the tabs for the panels in the panel group and the button for the panel 
menu remain visible after you collapse a panel.
special notes about the tools panel and options bar
The Tools panel and the options bar share some characteristics with other panels: 
• You can drag the Tools panel by its title bar to a different location in the work 
area. You can move the options bar to another location by dragging the grab bar 
at the far left end of the panel.
 Note: You can 
collapse, but not resize, 
the Color, Character, 
and Paragraph panels.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 33
• You can hide the Tools panel and options bar. 
However, some panel features are not available or don’t apply to the Tools panel or 
options bar:
• You cannot group the Tools panel or options bar with other panels. 
• You cannot resize the Tools panel or options bar. 
• You cannot stack the Tools panel or options bar in the panel dock. 
• The Tools panel and options bar do not have panel menus.
Customizing the workspace
It’s great that Photoshop offers so many ways to control the display and location of 
the options bar and its many panels, but it can be time-consuming to drag panels 
around the screen so that you can see some panels for certain projects and other 
panels for other projects. That’s why Photoshop lets you customize your work-
space, controlling which panels, tools, and menus are available at any time. In fact, 
it comes with a few preset workspaces suitable for different types of workflows—
tone and color correction, painting and retouching, and so on. You’ll experiment 
with them.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Painting. If prompted, click Yes to apply the 
workspace.
If you’ve been experimenting with opening, closing, and moving panels, you’ll 
notice that Photoshop closes some panels, opens others, and stacks them neatly in 
the dock along the right edge of the workspace. 
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Photography. If prompted, click Yes to apply 
the workspace. Different panels appear in the dock. 
3 Click the Workspace Switcher in the  
options bar, and choose Essentials. 
Photoshop returns to the default 
workspace, which is arranged as you 
left it. (To return the Essentials 
workspace to its original 
configuration, choose Reset 
Essentials from the Workspace 
Switcher menu.) 
You can choose workspaces from the Window menu or from the pop-up menu in 
the options bar. 
 Note:  If you closed 
01C_Start.psd at the 
end of the previous 
exercise, open it—or 
open any other image 
file—to complete the 
following exercise.

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
For times when presets don’t suit your purposes, you can customize the workspace 
to your specific needs. Say, for example, that you do lots of web design, but no digi-
tal video work. You can specify which menu items to display in the workspace.
4 Click the View menu, and choose Pixel Aspect Ratio to see the submenu.
This submenu includes several DV formats that many print and web designers 
don’t need to use.
5 Choose Window > Workspace > Keyboard Shortcuts And Menus.
The Keyboard Shortcuts And Menus dialog box lets you control which applica- 
tion and panel menu commands are available, as well as create custom keyboard 
shortcuts for menus, panels, and tools. You can hide commands that you use  
infrequently, or highlight commonly used commands to make them easier to see.
6 Click the Menus tab in the Keyboard Shortcuts And Menus dialog box, and then 
choose Application Menus from the Menu For pop-up menu.
7 Expand the View menu commands by clicking the triangle next to View.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 35
Photoshop displays the View menu commands and subcommands.
8 Scroll down to Pixel Aspect Ratio, and click the eye icon to turn off visibility for 
all of the DV and video formats—there are seven of them, beginning with D1/
DV NTSC (0.91) and ending with DVCPro HD 1080 (1.5). Photoshop removes 
them from the menu for this workspace.
9 Expand the Image menu commands.
10 Scroll down to the Image > Mode > RGB Color command, and click None in  
the Color column. Choose Red from the pop-up menu to highlight this 
command in red.
11 Click OK to close the Keyboard Shortcuts And Menus dialog box.

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Work Area
12 Choose Image > Mode. RGB Color is now highlighted in red. 
13 Choose View > Pixel Aspect Ratio. The DV and video formats are no longer 
included in this submenu. 
14 To save a workspace, choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace. In the 
New Workspace dialog box, give your workspace a name, select the Keyboard 
Shortcuts and Menus options, and then click Save. 
The custom workspace you save is listed in the Window > Workspace submenu and 
in the Workspace Switcher on the options bar.
For now, return to the default workspace configuration.
15 Choose Essentials from the Workspace Switcher on the options bar. Don’t save 
the changes in the current workspace.
Congratulations again. You’ve finished Lesson 1! 
 Note: Selecting the 
Essentials workspace 
changes the panel 
configuration, but 
doesn’t restore the 
menus to their defaults. 
You can do that now, 
or leave them altered. 
You’ll reset defaults as 
you begin work on most 
lessons that follow.

Adobe Photoshop includes a variety of tools and  
commands for improving the quality of a photo-
graphic image. This lesson steps you through the 
process of acquiring, resizing, and retouching a photo 
intended for a print layout. The same basic workflow 
applies to web images.

strategy for retouching
How much retouching you do depends on the image you’re working on and your 
goals for it. For many images, you can achieve your desired outcome with just a few 
clicks in Adobe Camera Raw, which is installed with Adobe Photoshop. For others, 
you may start in Camera Raw to adjust the white point, for example, and then move 
on to Photoshop for more advanced retouching, such as applying filters to selected 
parts of an image. 
Organizing an efficient sequence of tasks
Most retouching procedures follow these general steps:
• Duplicating the original image or scan; working in a copy of the image file makes 
it easy to recover the original later if necessary
• Ensuring that the resolution is appropriate for the way you’ll use the image
• Cropping the image to final size and orientation
• Repairing flaws in scans of damaged photographs (such as rips, dust, or stains)
• Adjusting the overall contrast or tonal range of the image
• Removing any color casts
• Adjusting the color and tone in specific parts of the image to bring out 
highlights, midtones, shadows, and desaturated colors
• Sharpening the overall focus of the image
Usually, you should complete these processes in the order listed. Otherwise, the 
results of one process may cause unintended changes to other aspects of the image, 
making it necessary for you to redo some of your work.
adjusting your process for different intended uses
The retouching techniques you apply to an image depend in part on how you’ll 
use the image. Whether an image is intended for black-and-white publication on 
newsprint or for full-color online distribution affects everything from the resolu-
tion of the initial scan to the type of tonal range and color correction that the image 
requires. Photoshop supports the CMYK color mode for preparing an image to be 
printed using process colors, as well as RGB and other color modes for web and 
mobile authoring.
To illustrate one application of retouching techniques, this lesson takes you 
through the steps of correcting a photograph intended for four-color print 
publication. 
For more information about CMYK and RGB color modes, see Lesson 14, 
“Producing and Printing Consistent Color.”
 Note: In Lesson 1, 
you used an adjustment 
layer, which gives 
you great flexibility 
to experiment with 
different correction 
settings without  
risking damage to the 
original image.

resolution and image size
The first step in retouching a photo-
graph in Photoshop is to make sure that 
the image has an appropriate resolution. 
The term resolution refers to the num-
ber of small squares, known as pixels, 
that describe an image and establish its 
detail. Resolution is determined by pixel 
dimensions, or the number of pixels 
along the width and height of an image. 
In computer graphics, there are different types of resolution:
The number of pixels per unit of length in an image is called the image resolution, 
usually measured in pixels per inch (ppi). An image with a high resolution has more 
pixels (and therefore a larger file size) than an image of the same dimensions with 
a low resolution. Images in Photoshop can vary from high resolution (300 ppi or 
higher) to low resolution (72 ppi or 96 ppi). 
The number of pixels per unit of length on a monitor is the monitor resolution, also 
usually measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Image pixels are translated directly into 
monitor pixels. In Photoshop, if the image resolution is higher than the monitor 
resolution, the image appears larger onscreen than its specified print dimensions. 
For example, when you display a 1x1-inch, 144-ppi image on a 72-ppi monitor, the 
image fills a 2x2-inch area of the screen.
4x6 inches at 72 ppi;
ﬁle size 364.5 KB
100% onscreen view
4x6 inches at 200 ppi;
ﬁle size 2.75 MB
100% onscreen view
The number of ink dots per inch (dpi) produced by a platesetter or laser printer is 
the printer, or output, resolution. Higher resolution images output to higher 
resolution printers generally produce the best quality. The appropriate resolution 
for a printed image is determined both by the printer resolution and by the screen 
frequency, or lines per inch (lpi), of the halftone screens used to reproduce images.
Pixels in a photographic image
 Note: It’s important 
to understand what 
“100% view” means 
when you work 
onscreen. At 100%, 
one image pixel = one 
monitor pixel. Unless 
the resolution of your 
image is exactly the 
same as the resolution 
of the monitor, the 
image size (in inches, 
for example) onscreen 
may be larger or smaller 
than the image size will 
be when printed.

48 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
Keep in mind that the higher the image resolution, the larger the file size, and the 
longer the file takes to download from the web.
For more information on resolution and image size, see Photoshop Help. 
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll prepare a scanned photograph to be placed in an Adobe 
InDesign layout for a fictitious magazine. The final image size in the print layout will 
be 3.5x2.5 inches.
You’ll start the lesson by comparing the original scan to the finished image.
1 Start Adobe Bridge CS6 by choosing Start > All Programs > Adobe Bridge CS6 
(Windows) or double-clicking Adobe Bridge CS6 in the Applications folder  
(Mac OS).
2 In the Favorites panel in the upper left corner of Bridge, click the Lessons folder. 
Then, in the Content panel, double-click the Lesson02 folder to see its contents.
3  Compare the 02Start.jpg and 02End.psd files. To enlarge the thumbnails in the 
Content panel, drag the Thumbnail slider at the bottom of the Bridge window to 
the right. 
In the 02Start.jpg file, notice that the image is crooked, the colors are relatively dull, 
and the image has a red color cast. The dimensions are also larger than needed for 
the requirements of the magazine. You’ll fix all of these problems in this lesson, and 
even change the color of the girl’s cap. You’ll start by addressing the color and tone 
of the image.
4 Select the 02Start.jpg thumbnail, and choose File > Open In Camera Raw.
The image opens in Camera Raw. As you make changes to the image, Camera Raw 
saves those changes in a separate file that is associated with your original image file. 
You can return to the original at any time when working in Camera Raw. 
 Note: To determine 
the image resolution 
for the photograph in 
this lesson, we followed 
the computer-graphics 
rule of thumb for color 
or grayscale images 
intended for print 
on large commercial 
printers: Scan at a 
resolution 1.5 to 2 times 
the screen frequency 
used by the printer. 
Because the magazine 
in which the image will 
be printed uses a screen 
frequency of 133 lpi, the 
image was scanned at 
200 ppi (133x1.5).

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 49
adjusting the color in Camera raw
You’ll start by removing the color cast and adjusting the color and tone in the image.
1 Select the White Balance tool ( ) at the top of the Camera Raw dialog box. 
Adjusting the white balance changes all the colors in the image. To set an accurate 
white balance, select an area that should be white or gray. 
2 Click a white area of the graffiti. The color tone of the image changes 
dramatically. 
3 Click the girl’s white shoe. The color tone changes again.
 Note: You’ll work 
with Camera Raw more 
extensively in Lesson 5.

50 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
In some images, adjusting the white balance is enough to remove a color cast and 
correct the tone of the image. Here, selecting a white balance is a good start. You’ll 
use settings in the Basic panel to fine-tune the tone.
4 In the Basic panel, move the Temperature slider to -53 and  
the Tint slider to -54. 
5 In the next section of the Basic panel, move the sliders to the following values: 
• Exposure: -.50
• Contrast: +23
• Blacks: 18
6 In the bottom section of the Basic panel, move the sliders to the following 
values: 
• Clarity: +12
• Vibrance: +25
• Saturation: +5
7 Deselect Preview at the top of the Camera Raw window to compare the edited 
version with the original image. Select Preview again to see how the changes 
affected it.
Preview selected
Preview deselected

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 51
You’re ready to move the image into Photoshop to continue retouching it.
8 Click Open Image at the bottom of the Camera Raw window to open the image 
in Photoshop. 
9 In Photoshop, choose File > Save As, rename the file 02Working.psd, and click 
Save to save it in the Lesson02 folder. 
Remember, when you’re making permanent corrections to an image file, it’s always 
wise to work on a copy rather than on the original. Then, if something goes horribly 
wrong, at least you’ll be able to start over on a fresh copy of the original image.
straightening and cropping 
the image in Photoshop
You’ll use the Crop tool to straighten, trim, and scale the photograph so that it fits 
the space designed for it. You can use either the Crop tool or the Crop command to 
crop an image. By default, cropping is nondestructive, so you can change your mind 
and recover the original pixels later if you want to.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Crop tool ( ). 
2 In the options bar, choose Size & Resolution from the Preset Aspect Ratio menu. 
(Unconstrained is its default value.)
3 In the Crop Image Size & Resolution dialog box, enter 3.5 inches for the Width, 
2.5 inches for the Height, and 200 pixels/inch for the Resolution. Click OK.
The Preset Aspect Ratio changes to reflect the preset you created, and a crop grid 
appears. A cropping shield covers the area outside the cropping selection. First, 
you’ll straighten the image

52 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
4 Click Straighten in the options bar. The pointer changes to the Straighten tool.
5 Click at the top corner of the photo, and drag a straight line across the top edge 
of the photo. 
Photoshop straightens the image, so that the line you drew is parallel with the top of 
the image area. You drew a line across the top of the photo but any line that defines 
either the vertical or horizontal axis of the image will work.
Now, you’ll trim the white border and scale the image.
6 Drag the corners of the crop grid in to the corners of the photo, so that no white 
remains. Use the arrow keys if you need to nudge the photo up or down within 
the crop grid.
7 Press Enter or Return. The image is now cropped, and the cropped image 
fills the image window, straightened, sized, and cropped according to your 
specifications. 
8 To see the image dimensions, choose Document Dimensions from the pop-up 
menu at the bottom of the application window.
9 Choose File > Save to save your work. Click OK if you see the Photoshop Format 
Options dialog box.
E Tip: You can choose 
Image > Trim to discard 
a border area around 
the edge of the image, 
based on transparency 
or edge color.

replacing colors in an image
Use the Color Replacement tool to paint over one color with another. When you 
start painting with the Color Replacement tool, it analyzes the first pixels you paint 
over. Because it then only replaces pixels of a similar color, you don’t have to be 
terribly precise as you paint. You can select settings that determine whether the 
tool paints over contiguous or discontiguous pixels, and how much color difference 
the tool accepts. 
You’ll use the Color Replacement tool to change the color of the child’s cap in the 
image of the playground.
1 Zoom in to see the child’s cap clearly.
2 Select the Color Replacement tool (
) in the Tools panel, hidden behind the 
Brush tool (
). 
3 Click the Foreground Color swatch in the Tools panel. In the Color Picker,  
select a shade of green. We selected an RGB color with the values R=49, G=184, 
and B=6. 
You’ll paint the foreground color over the red hat.
4 In the options bar, open the Brush pop-up 
panel to view brush options. 
5 Move the Size slider to 13 pixels, the 
Hardness slider to 40%, and the Spacing 
slider to 25%. Choose Off from the Size and 
Tolerance menus.

54 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
6 In the options bar, choose Hue from the Mode menu. Then click Sampling: 
Continous (
) (the button next to the Hue menu). Choose Find Edges from the 
Limits menu, and set the Tolerance to 32%. Make sure Anti-Alias is selected.
7 Begin painting in the middle of the hat, and paint out toward the edges.
8 Choose a smaller brush, if you like, and continue painting out towards the edges 
of the hat. You can zoom in if needed.
9 When the hat is green, save the file.
adjusting saturation with the sponge tool
When you change the saturation of a color, you adjust its strength or purity. The 
Sponge tool is useful for making subtle saturation changes to specific areas of an 
image. You’ll use the Sponge tool to saturate the color of some of the graffiti. 
1 Zoom out or scroll, if necessary, to see the 
colorful graffiti.
2 Select the Sponge tool (
), hidden under 
the Dodge tool (
).

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 55
3 In the options bar, do the following:
• In the Brush pop-up panel, move the Size slider to 150 px, and then move the 
Hardness slider to 0%.
• Choose Saturate from the Mode menu. 
• For Flow, enter 40%. The Flow value determines the intensity of the 
saturation effect.
4 Drag the sponge back and forth over the graffiti to the left of the girl to increase 
the saturation. The more you drag over an area, the more saturated the color 
becomes. Be careful not to oversaturate the graffiti.
5 Select the Move tool (
) to ensure you don’t accidentally add saturation 
elsewhere.
6 Save your work.
repairing areas with the Clone stamp tool
The Clone Stamp tool uses pixels from one area of an image to replace the pixels 
in another part of the image. Using this tool, you can not only remove unwanted 
objects from your images, but you can also fill in missing areas in photographs you 
scan from damaged originals. 
You’ll start by replacing a bright white area of the wall—a hot spot—with cloned 
bricks from another area of the picture. 
1 Select the Clone Stamp tool (
) in the Tools panel.
2 In the options bar, open the Brush pop-up menu, and set the size to 21 and the 
hardness to 0%. Then, make sure that the Aligned option is selected. 

56 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
3 Choose Window > Clone Source to open the Clone Source panel. This  
panel gives you greater control over the area you’re cloning from (in this case, 
the bricks). 
4 Select Show Overlay and Clipped in the Clone Source panel. Then, make sure 
Opacity is set to 100%. The overlay lets you see what you’re cloning before you 
stamp it. 
5 Move the Clone Stamp tool over the darker bricks just to the right of the hot 
spot on the wall. (You may want to zoom in to see the area better.)
6 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) to start sampling that part of the 
image. (When you press Alt or Option, the pointer appears as target cross-hairs.) 
7 Starting at the area just to the right of the girl’s hat, drag the Clone Stamp  
tool to the right, over the hot spot on the bricks. The clone overlay lets you see  
what will appear there. This is particularly useful for keeping the bricks in a 
straight line.
8 Release the mouse button and move the pointer to another area in the hot spot, 
and then start dragging again.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 57
Each time you click the Clone Stamp tool, it begins again with a new source point, 
in the same relationship to the tool as the first stroke you made. That is, if you begin 
painting further right, it samples from bricks that are further right than the original 
source point. That’s because Aligned is selected in the options bar.
9 Continue cloning the bricks until the entire hot spot is filled in. 
If necessary to help make the bricks appear to blend in naturally with the rest of  
the image, you can adjust your cloning by resetting the sample area (as you did  
in step 6) and recloning. Or, you can try deselecting the Aligned option and  
cloning again.
10 When you’re satisfied with the appearance of the bricks, close the Clone Source 
panel, and choose File > Save. 
using the spot healing Brush tool 
The next task is to clean up some dark spots in the wall. You could do this with the 
Clone Stamp tool (
), but instead you’ll use another technique. You’ll use the Spot 
Healing Brush to clean up the wall.
The Spot Healing Brush tool quickly removes blemishes and other imperfections 
from photos. It paints with sampled pixels from an image or pattern and matches the 
texture, lighting, transparency, and shading of the sampled pixels to the pixels being 
healed. Unlike the Clone Stamp tool, the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to 
specify a sample spot. It automatically samples from around the retouched area.
The Spot Healing Brush is excellent for retouching blemishes in portraits, but will 
also work nicely in this image in the dark area of the wall, because the wall has a 
uniform, muted appearance to the right of the dark areas.
 Note: When the 
Aligned option is not 
selected, each time 
you make a stroke, you 
begin sampling from 
the same source point, 
regardless of where you 
place the tool.
 Note: The Healing 
Brush tool works 
similarly to the Spot 
Healing Brush tool, 
except that it requires 
you to sample 
source pixels before 
retouching an area.

58 
lesson 2 
basic Photo Corrections
1 Zoom in or scroll to see the dark areas on the upper left corner of the image.
2 In the Tools panel, select the Spot Healing Brush tool (
). 
3 In the options bar, open the Brush pop-up panel, and specify a 100% hard brush 
that is about 40 px in diameter. 
4 In the image window, drag the Spot Healing Brush from right to left across the 
dark spots in the upper left corner of the image. You can use as many or as few 
strokes as you like; paint until you’re satisfied with the results. As you drag, the 
stroke at first appears black, but when you release the mouse, the painted area 
is “healed.”
5 Choose File > Save.
applying a content-aware patch
Content-aware tools take blending a few steps further: Photoshop fills a selection 
with pixels that match the surroundings. Using the Patch tool in Content-Aware 
mode isn’t like cloning, because you aren’t copying part of the image to another 
part. Really, it’s more like magic. You can fill any selection with content similar to 
the content around it, as if the object you selected never existed. You’ll get a chance 
to see it for yourself as you touch up the brick wall, removing the large crack and 
the dark areas of the wall on the left. Because the wall varies in color, texture, and 
lighting, it would be challenging to successfully use the Clone Stamp tool to touch 
up these areas. Fortunately, the Patch tool makes this process easy.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 59
1 In the Tools panel, select the Patch tool (
), hidden beneath the Spot Healing 
Brush tool (
).
2 In the options bar, choose Content-Aware from the Patch menu. Then make 
sure Medium is selected in the Adaptation menu, and that Sample All Layers is 
selected.
3 Drag the Patch tool around the crack in the wall to select it.
4 Click within the area you’ve just selected and drag it to the right.  
The selection changes to match the area around it.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 Use the Patch tool to select the darker area on the left edge of the wall. You can 
draw outside the photo to make sure the selection includes the very edge of the 
image.
7 Drag the selected area to the right.
8 Choose Select > Deselect.

applying the unsharp Mask filter 
The last task you might want to do when retouching a photo is to apply the  
Unsharp Mask filter. The Unsharp Mask filter adjusts the contrast of the edge detail 
and creates the illusion of a more focused image.
1 Choose Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask.
2 In the Unsharp Mask dialog box, make 
sure that Preview is selected so you can 
see the effect of settings you adjust in the 
image window. 
You can drag inside the preview window in 
the dialog box to see different parts of the 
image, or use the plus and minus buttons 
below the thumbnail to zoom in and out.
3 Drag the Amount slider to about 70% to 
sharpen the image.
4 Drag the Radius slider to determine the 
number of pixels surrounding the edge 
pixels that will affect the sharpening. The 
higher the resolution, the higher the Radius setting should be. (We used the 
default value, 1.0 pixel.) 
5 (Optional) Adjust the Threshold slider. This determines how different the 
sharpened pixels must be from the surrounding area before they are considered 
edge pixels and subsequently sharpened by the Unsharp Mask filter. The default 
Threshold value of 0 sharpens all pixels in the image. Try a different value, such 
as 2 or 3.
6 When you’re satisfied with the 
results, click OK to apply the 
Unsharp Mask filter.
7 Choose File > Save.
E Tip: As you try 
different settings, 
toggle the Preview 
option on and off to 
see how your changes 
affect the image. Or, 
you can click and hold 
the mouse button on 
the preview window 
in the dialog box to 
temporarily toggle the 
filter off in the preview 
window. If your image 
is large, using the 
preview window can  
be more efficient, 
because only a small 
area is redrawn.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 61
about unsharp masking
Unsharp masking, or USM, is a traditional film-compositing technique used to 
sharpen edges in an image. The Unsharp Mask filter corrects blurring introduced 
during photographing, scanning, resampling, or printing. It’s useful for images 
intended for both print and online viewing.
Unsharp Mask locates pixels that differ from surrounding pixels by the threshold 
you set and increases the pixels’ contrast by the amount you specify. In addition, 
you can adjust the radius of the region to which each pixel is compared.
The effects of the Unsharp Mask filter are far more pronounced onscreen than they 
are in high-resolution output. If your final destination is print, experiment to deter-
mine which settings work best for your image.
saving the image for four-color printing
Before you save a Photoshop file for use in a four-color publication, you must 
change the image to CMYK color mode. You’ll use the Mode command to change 
the image color mode. 
For more information about converting between color modes, see Photoshop Help.
1 Choose File > Save As, and save the file as 02_CMYK.psd. Click OK if you see a 
Photoshop Format Options dialog box. 
It’s a good idea to save a copy of your original file before changing color modes, so 
that you can make changes in the original later, if necessary.
2 Choose Image > Mode > CMYK Color. Click OK when Photoshop displays an 
alert about the color management profile. 
If you were preparing this image for a real publication, you’d want to confirm that 
you were using the appropriate CMYK profile. See Lesson 14, “Producing and 
Printing Consistent Color,” to learn about color management.
E Tip: Most images 
include more than one 
layer. Choose Layer > 
Merge Visible before 
you change the color 
mode to ensure that all 
the changes you made 
are included in the 
CMYK image.

3 If you use Adobe InDesign to create  
your publications, simply choose  
File > Save. InDesign can import  
native Photoshop (PSD) files, so  
there is no need to convert the

If you’re using another layout 
application, choose File > Save As, 
and then proceed to step 4 to save 
the image as a TIFF file.
4 In the Save As dialog box, choose 
TIFF from the Format menu.
5 Click Save.
6 In the TIFF Options dialog box, 
select your operating system for the

extra credit
You can get great results converting a color image to black and white (with or without a tint) in 
Photoshop or Camera Raw.
In Photoshop:
1 
Choose File > Open, and navigate to the bike.jpg file in the Lesson02 folder. Click Open. 
2 
If the file opens in Camera Raw, click Open Image to open it in Photoshop.
3 
In the Adjustments panel, click the Black & White button to add a Black & White adjustment layer.
4 
Adjust the color sliders to change the saturation of color channels. You can also experiment with 
options from the preset menu, such as Darker or Infrared. Or, select the tool in the upper left 
corner of the Adjustments panel, and then drag it across the image to adjust the colors associated 
with that area. (We darkened the bike itself and made the background areas lighter.)

review answers
1 The term resolution refers to the number of pixels that describe an image and establish 
its detail. Image resolution and monitor resolution are measured in pixels per inch (ppi). 
Printer, or output, resolution is measured in ink dots per inch (dpi).
2 You can use the Crop tool to trim, scale, or straighten an image.
3 Use the White Balance tool to adjust the color temperature. Then fine-tune the color 
and tone using sliders in the Basic panel.
4 The Healing Brush, Spot Healing Brush, Patch tool, and Clone Stamp tools, as well as 
content-aware fill, let you replace unwanted portions of an image with other areas of 
the image. The Clone Stamp tool copies the source area exactly; the Healing Brush 
and Spot Healing Brush tools blend the area with the surrounding pixels. The Spot 
Healing Brush tool doesn’t require a source area at all; it “heals” areas to match the 
surrounding pixels. The Patch tool in Content-Aware mode, and content-aware fill 
replace a selection with content that matches the surrounding area.
5 The Unsharp Mask filter adjusts the contrast of the edge detail and creates the illusion 
of a more focused image.

Learning how to select areas of an image is of primary 
importance—you must first select what you want to 
affect. Once you’ve made a selection, only the area 
within the selection can be edited.

lesson 3 Working with selections
about selecting and selection tools
Making changes to an area within an image in Photoshop is a two-step process. 
You first select the part of an image you want to change with one of the selection 
tools. Then, you use another tool, filter, or other feature to make changes, such as 
moving the selected pixels to another location or applying a filter to the selected 
area. You can make selections based on size, shape, and color. The selection process 
limits changes to within the selected area. Other areas are unaffected.
The best selection tool for a specific area often depends on the characteristics of 
that area, such as shape or color. There are four types of selections:
Geometric selections The Rectangular Marquee tool ( ) selects a rectangular 
area in an image. The Elliptical Marquee tool ( ), which is hidden behind the 
Rectangular Marquee tool, selects elliptical areas. The Single Row Marquee  
tool ( ) and Single Column Marquee tool ( ) select either a 1-pixel-high row  
or a 1-pixel-wide column, respectively. 
Freehand selections The Lasso tool ( ) traces a freehand selection around an area. 
The Polygonal Lasso tool ( ) sets anchor points in straight-line segments around an 
area. The Magnetic Lasso tool ( ) works something like a combination of the other 
two lasso tools, and gives the best results when good contrast exists between the 
area you want to select and its surroundings.
Edge-based selections The Quick Selection tool (
) quickly “paints” a selection by 
automatically finding and following defined edges in the image.
Color-based selections The Magic Wand tool (
) selects parts of an image based 
on the similarity in color of adjacent pixels. It is useful for selecting odd-shaped 
areas that share a specific range of colors. 
 Note: You’ll learn 
how to select vector 
areas using the pen 
tools in Lesson 8, 
“Vector Drawing 
Techniques.”

Getting started
First, you’ll look at the image you will create as you explore the selection tools in 
Adobe Photoshop. 
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.)
2 When prompted, click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the Adobe 
Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 In the Favorites panel, click the Lessons folder. Then, double-click the Lesson03 
folder in the Content panel to see its contents.
5 Study the 03End.psd file. Move the thumbnail slider to the right if you want to 
see the image in more detail.
The project is a collage of objects, includ-
ing a piece of coral, a sand dollar, a mussel, 
a nautilus, a bowl of small shells, a wooden 
plate, and the “Sally’s Seashells” logo. The 
challenge in this lesson is to arrange these 
elements, which were scanned together on 
the single page you see in the 03Start.psd 
file. The ideal composition is up to you, so 
this lesson won’t describe precise locations. 
There is no right or wrong position for any 
of the objects.
6 Double-click the 03Start.psd thumbnail to open the image file in Photoshop.
7 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 03Working.psd, and click Save. 
By saving another version of the start file, you don’t have to worry about 
overwriting the original.
using the quick selection tool
The Quick Selection tool provides one of the easiest ways to make a selection. You 
simply paint an area of an image, and the tool automatically finds the edges. You 
can add or subtract areas of the selection until you have exactly the area you want. 
The image of the sand dollar in the 03Working.psd file has clearly defined edges, 
making it an ideal candidate for the Quick Selection tool. You’ll select just the sand 
dollar, not the shadow or background behind it.

70 
lesson 3 Working with selections
1 Select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel, and then zoom in so that you can see 
the sand dollar well.
2 Select the Quick Selection tool (
) in the Tools panel.
3 Click on an off-white area near the outside edge of the sand dollar. The Quick 
Selection tool finds the full edge automatically, selecting the entire sand dollar.
Leave the selection active so that you can use it in the next exercise.
Moving a selected area
Once you’ve made a selection, any changes you make apply exclusively to the pixels 
within the selection. The rest of the image is not affected by those changes.
To move the selected area to another part of the composition, you use the Move 
tool. This image has only one layer, so the pixels you move will replace the pixels 
beneath them. This change is not permanent until you deselect the moved pixels, 
so you can try different locations for the selection you’re moving before you make a 
commitment.
1 If the sand dollar is not still selected, repeat the previous exercise to select it.
2 Zoom out so you can see both the wooden plate and the sand dollar.
3 Select the Move tool (
). Notice that the 
sand dollar remains selected.
4 Drag the selected area (the sand dollar) 
toward the left of the collage so that the 
sand dollar overlaps the lower left edge of 
the wooden plate. 
5 Choose Select > Deselect, and then 
choose File > Save.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 71
In Photoshop, it’s not easy to lose a selection. Unless a selection tool is active, 
clicking elsewhere in the image will not deselect the active area. To deliberately 
deselect a selection, you can choose Select > Deselect, press Ctrl+D (Windows) or 
Command+D (Mac OS), or click outside the selection with any selection tool to 
start a different selection.

tool tips from the Photoshop 
evangelist
Move tool tip
If you’re moving objects in a multilayer file with the Move tool and you suddenly 
need to select one of the layers, try this: With the Move tool selected, move the 
pointer over any area of an image and right-click (Windows) or Control-click  
(Mac OS). The layers that are under the pointer appear in the context menu.  
Choose the one you’d like to make active.
Manipulating selections
You can move selections, reposition them as you create them, and even duplicate 
them. In this section, you’ll learn several ways to manipulate selections. Most of 
these methods work with any selection, but you’ll use them here with the Elliptical 
Marquee tool, which lets you select ovals or perfect circles.
One of the best things about this section is the introduction of keyboard shortcuts 
that can save you time and arm motions.
repositioning a selection marquee while creating it
Selecting ovals and circles can be tricky. It’s not always obvious where you should 
start dragging, so sometimes the selection will be off-center, or the ratio of width 
to height won’t match what you need. In this exercise, you’ll learn techniques for 
managing those problems, including two important keyboard-mouse combinations 
that can make your Photoshop work much easier.
As you perform this exercise, be very careful to follow the directions about keep-
ing the mouse button or specific keys pressed. If you accidentally release the mouse 
button at the wrong time, simply start the exercise again from step 1.

72 
lesson 3 Working with selections
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and click the bowl of shells on the right side of the 
image window to zoom in to at least 100% view (use 200% view if the entire 
bowl of shells will still fit in the image window on your screen). 
2 Select the Elliptical Marquee tool ( ), hidden under the Rectangular Marquee 
tool ( ).
3 Move the pointer over the bowl of shells, and drag diagonally across the oval 
bowl to create a selection, but do not release the mouse button. It’s OK if your 
selection does not match the bowl shape yet.
If you accidentally release the mouse button, draw the selection again. In most 
cases—including this one—the new selection replaces the previous one.
4 Still holding down the mouse button, press the spacebar, and continue to drag 
the selection. Instead of resizing the selection, now you’re moving it. Position it 
so that it more closely aligns with the bowl.
5 Carefully release the spacebar (but not the mouse button) and continue to drag, 
trying to make the size and shape of the selection match the oval bowl of shells 
as closely as possible. If necessary, hold down the spacebar again and drag to 
move the selection marquee into position around the bowl of shells.
Begin dragging a selection. 
Press the spacebar to move it.  
Complete the selection.
6 When the selection border is positioned appropriately, release the mouse button.
7 Choose View > Zoom Out or use the slider in the Navigator panel to reduce the 
zoom view so that you can see all of the objects in the image window.
Leave the Elliptical Marquee tool and the selection active for the next exercise.
Moving selected pixels with a keyboard shortcut
Now you’ll use a keyboard shortcut to move the selected pixels onto the wooden 
plate. The shortcut temporarily switches the active tool to the Move tool, so you 
don’t need to select it from the Tools panel. 
1 If the bowl of shells is not still selected, repeat the previous exercise to select it.
 Note: You don’t 
have to include every 
pixel in the bowl of 
shells, but the selection 
should be the shape of 
the bowl, and should 
contain the shells 
comfortably.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 73
2 With the Elliptical Marquee tool ( ) selected in the Tools panel, press Ctrl 
(Windows) or Command (Mac OS), and move the pointer within the selection. 
The pointer icon now includes a pair of scissors (
) to indicate that the 
selection will be cut from its current location.
3 Drag the bowl of shells onto the wooden 
plate so that it overlaps the upper left 
edge of the wooden plate. (You’ll use 
another technique to nudge the oval 
bowl into the exact position in a minute.) 
4 Release the mouse button, but don’t 
deselect the bowl of shells.
Moving with the arrow keys
You can make minor adjustments to the position of selected pixels by using the 
arrow keys. You can nudge the selection in increments of either one pixel or 
ten pixels. 
When a selection tool is active in the Tools panel, the arrow keys nudge the selec-
tion border, but not the contents. When the Move tool is active, the arrow keys 
move the selection border and its contents. 
You’ll use the arrow keys to nudge the bowl of shells. Before you begin, make sure 
that the bowl of shells is still selected in the image window.
1 Press the Up Arrow key ( ) on your keyboard a few times to move the oval 
upward.
Notice that each time you press the arrow key, the bowl of shells moves one pixel. 
Experiment by pressing the other arrow keys to see how they affect the selection. 
2 Hold down the Shift key as you press an arrow key.
When you hold down the Shift key, the selection moves ten pixels every time you 
press an arrow key. 
Sometimes the border around a selected area can distract you as you make adjust-
ments. You can hide the edges of a selection temporarily without actually deselect-
ing, and then display the selection border once you’ve completed the adjustments. 
 Note: You can 
release the Ctrl or 
Command key after 
you start dragging, and 
the Move tool remains 
active. Photoshop 
reverts to the previously 
selected tool when 
you deselect, whether 
you click outside the 
selection or use the 
Deselect command.

74 
lesson 3 Working with selections
3 Choose View > Show > Selection Edges or View > Extras.
Either command hides the selection border around the bowl of shells.
4 Use the arrow keys to nudge the bowl of shells until it’s positioned where you 
want it. Then choose View > Show > Selection Edges to reveal the selection 
border again.
	
Visible selection edges
5 Choose Select > Deselect, or press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D  
(Mac OS).
6 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
selecting from a center point
In some cases, it’s easier to make elliptical or rectangular selections by drawing a 
selection from the center point. You’ll use this technique to select the logo graphic. 
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and zoom in on the logo to a magnification of about 
300%. Make sure that you can see the entire Sally’s Seashells graphic in your 
image window.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 75
2 Select the Elliptical Marquee tool ( ) in the Tools panel.
3 Move the pointer to the approximate center of the Sally’s Seashells graphic. 
4 Click and begin dragging. Then, without releasing the mouse button, press Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you continue dragging the selection to the 
outer edge of the Sally’s Seashells graphic.
The selection is centered over its starting point.
5 When you have the entire Sally’s Seashells graphic selected, release the mouse 
button first, and then release Alt or Option (and the Shift key if you used it). Do 
not deselect, because you’ll use this selection in the next exercise.
6 If necessary, reposition the selection border using one of the methods you 
learned earlier. If you accidentally released the Alt or Option key before you 
released the mouse button, try selecting the Sally’s Seashells graphic again.
Moving and changing the pixels in a selection
Now you’ll move the Sally’s Seashells graphic to the upper right corner of the 
wooden plate. Then, you’ll change its color for a dramatic effect.
Before you begin, make sure that the Sally’s Seashells graphic is still selected. If it’s 
not, reselect it by completing the previous exercise.
1 Choose View > Fit On Screen so that the entire image fits within the image 
window.
2 Select the Move tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
3 Position the pointer within the Sally’s Seashells graphic selection. The pointer 
becomes an arrow with a pair of scissors (
), which indicates that dragging the 
selection will cut it from its current location and move it to the new location.
E Tip: To select a 
perfect circle, press  
Shift as you drag. 
Hold down Shift 
while dragging the 
Rectangular Marquee 
tool to select a  
perfect square.

76 
lesson 3 Working with selections
4 Drag the Sally’s Seashells graphic onto the upper right corner of the plate. If you 
want to adjust the position after you stop dragging, simply start dragging again. 
The Sally’s Seashells graphic remains selected throughout the process.
5 Choose Image > Adjustments > Invert.
The colors making up the Sally’s Seashells graphic are inverted so that now it’s  
effectively a color negative of itself.
6 Leaving the Sally’s Seashells graphic selected, choose File > Save to save  
your work.
Moving and duplicating a selection simultaneously
You can move and duplicate a selection at the same time. You’ll make a copy of the 
logo graphic. If the logo graphic image is no longer selected, reselect it now, using 
the techniques you learned earlier.
1 With the Move tool (
) selected, press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) 
as you position the pointer inside the Sally’s Seashells graphic selection. The 
pointer becomes a double arrow, which indicates that a duplicate will be made 
when you move the selection.
2 Continue holding down the Alt or Option key as you drag a duplicate of the 
graphic down and to the right. The two copies of the graphic can overlap. 
Release the mouse button and the Alt or Option key, but don’t deselect the 
duplicate graphic.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 77
3 Choose Edit > Transform > Scale. A bounding box appears around the selection.
4 Press Shift as you drag one of the corner points to enlarge the graphic so that 
it becomes about 50% larger than the original. Then press Enter or Return to 
commit the change and remove the transformation bounding box. 
As you resize the object, the selection marquee resizes, too. The duplicate graphic 
remains selected. Pressing the Shift key as you resize the selection constrains the 
proportions so that the enlarged object isn’t distorted.
5 Hold down Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac OS), and drag a new 
copy of the second Sally’s Seashells graphic down and to the right. 
Pressing the Shift key as you move a selection constrains the movement horizontally 
or vertically in 45-degree increments.
6 Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the third Sally’s Seashells graphic, making it about twice 
the size of the first one.
7 When you’re satisfied with the size and position of the third Sally’s Seashells 
graphic, press Enter or Return to confirm the scale, choose Select > Deselect, 
and then choose File > Save.
For information on working with the center point in a transformation, see “Set or 
move the reference point for a transformation” in Photoshop Help.
E Tip: Choose Edit > 
Transform > Again 
to duplicate the logo 
and enlarge it by twice 
as much as the last 
transformation.

78 
lesson 3 Working with selections
Copying selections
You can use the Move tool to copy selections as you drag them within or between 
images, or you can copy and move selections using the Copy, Copy Merged, Cut, 
and Paste commands. Dragging with the Move tool saves memory because the 
clipboard is not used as it is with the commands. 
Photoshop has several copy and paste commands:
• 
Copy copies the selected area on the active layer.
• 
Copy Merged creates a merged copy of all the visible layers in the selected area.
• 
Paste pastes a cut or copied selection into another part of the image or into 
another image as a new layer. 
• 
Paste Into pastes a cut or copied selection inside another selection in the same 
or a different image. The source selection is pasted onto a new layer, and the 
destination selection border is converted into a layer mask.
Keep in mind that when a selection is pasted between images with different resolu-
tions, the pasted data retains its pixel dimensions. This can make the pasted portion 
appear out of proportion to the new image. Use the Image Size command to make 
the source and destination images the same resolution before copying and pasting.
using the Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool selects all the pixels of a particular color or color range. It’s 
most useful for selecting an area of similar colors surrounded by areas of very dif-
ferent colors. As with many of the selection tools, after you make the initial selec-
tion, you can add or subtract areas of the selection.
The Tolerance option sets the sensitivity of the Magic Wand tool. This value limits 
or extends the range of pixel similarity. The default tolerance value of 32 selects the 
color you click plus 32 lighter and 32 darker tones of that color. You may need to 
adjust the tolerance level up or down depending on the color ranges and variations 
in the image. 
If a multicolored area that you want to select is set against a background of a differ-
ent color, it can be much easier to select the background than the area itself. In this 
procedure, you’ll use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select a larger area, and then 
use the Magic Wand tool to subtract the background from the selection.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 79
1 Select the Rectangular Marquee tool ( ), hidden behind the Elliptical Marquee 
tool ( ).
2 Drag a selection around the piece of coral. Make sure that your selection is large 
enough so that a margin of white appears between the coral and the edges of the 
marquee.
At this point, the coral and the white background area are selected. You’ll subtract 
the white area from the selection so that only the coral remains in the selection.
3 Select the Magic Wand tool (
), hidden under the Quick Selection tool (
).
4 In the options bar, confirm that the Tolerance value is 32. This value determines 
the range of colors the wand selects. 
5 Select the Subtract From Selection button ( ) in the options bar. A minus sign 
appears next to the wand in the pointer icon. Anything you select now will be 
subtracted from the initial selection.
6  Click in the white background area within the selection marquee.
The Magic Wand tool selects the entire background, subtracting it from the selec-
tion. Now all the white pixels are deselected, leaving the coral perfectly selected.

80 
lesson 3 Working with selections
7 Select the Move tool (
), and drag  
the coral to the wooden plate, a little  
to the right and above the center of  
the plate.
8 Choose Select > Deselect, and then save 
your work.
selecting with the lasso tools
Photoshop includes three lasso tools: the Lasso tool, the Polygonal Lasso tool, and 
the Magnetic Lasso tool. You can use the Lasso tool to make selections that require 
both freehand and straight lines, using keyboard shortcuts to move back and forth 
between the Lasso tool and the Polygonal Lasso tool. You’ll use the Lasso tool to 
select the mussel. It takes a bit of practice to alternate between straight-line and 
freehand selections—if you make a mistake while you’re selecting the mussel,  
simply deselect and start again. 
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and click the mussel until the view enlarges to 100%. 
Make sure you can see the entire mussel in the window.
2 Select the Lasso tool ( ). Starting at the lower left section of the mussel, drag 
around the rounded end of the mussel, tracing the shape as accurately as 
possible. Do not release the mouse button. 
3 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and then release the mouse 
button so that the lasso pointer changes to the polygonal lasso shape ( ). Do not 
release the Alt or Option key.
4 Begin clicking along the end of the mussel to place anchor points, following the 
contours of the mussel. Be sure to hold down the Alt or Option key throughout 
this process.
	
Click with the Polygonal Lasso tool.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 81
The selection border automatically stretches like a rubber band between  
anchor points.
5 When you reach the tip of the mussel, hold down the mouse button as you 
release the Alt or Option key. The pointer again appears as the lasso icon.
6 Carefully drag around the tip of the mussel, holding down the mouse button. 
7 When you finish tracing the tip and reach the lower side of the mussel, first 
press Alt or Option again, and then release the mouse button. Click along the 
lower side of the mussel with the Polygonal Lasso tool as you did on the top. 
Continue to trace the mussel until you arrive back at the starting point of your 
selection near the left end of the image. 
8 Click at the start of the selection, and then release the Alt or Option key. The 
mussel is now entirely selected. Leave the mussel selected for the next exercise.
rotating a selection
So far, you’ve moved, resized, duplicated, and inverted the color of selected areas. 
In this exercise, you’ll see how easy it is to rotate a selected object.
Before you begin, make sure that the mussel is still selected.
1 Choose View > Fit On Screen to resize 
the image window to fit on your screen. 
2 Press Ctrl (Windows) or Command  
(Mac OS) as you drag the mussel to the 
lower section of the wooden plate. The 
pointer changes to the Move tool icon.
3 Choose Edit > Transform > Rotate. The mussel and selection marquee are 
enclosed in a bounding box.

82 
lesson 3 Working with selections
4 Move the pointer outside the bounding box so that it becomes a curved,  
double-headed arrow (
). Drag to rotate the mussel to a –15-degree angle. You 
can verify the angle in the Rotate box in the options bar. Press Enter or Return 
to commit the transformation changes.
5 If necessary, select the Move tool (
) and drag to reposition the mussel. When 
you’re satisfied, choose Select > Deselect.
6 Choose File > Save. 
selecting with the Magnetic Lasso tool
You can use the Magnetic Lasso tool to make freehand selections of areas with 
high-contrast edges. When you draw with the Magnetic Lasso tool, the selection 
border automatically snaps to the edge between areas of contrast. You can also 
control the selection path by occasionally clicking the mouse to place anchor points 
in the selection border.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 83
You’ll use the Magnetic Lasso tool to select the nautilus so that you can move  
it to the center of the plate.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and click the nautilus to zoom in to at least 100%. 
2 Select the Magnetic Lasso tool ( ), hidden under the Lasso tool ( ).
3 Click once along the left edge of the nautilus, and then move the Magnetic Lasso 
tool along the edge to trace its outline. 
Even though you’re not holding down the mouse button, the tool snaps to the edge 
of the nautilus and automatically adds fastening points. 
4 When you reach the left side of the nautilus again, double-click to return the 
Magnetic Lasso tool to the starting point, closing the selection. Or you can  
move the Magnetic Lasso tool over the starting point and click once.
5 Double-click the Hand tool ( ) to fit the image in the image window.
6 Select the Move tool (
), and drag the nautilus onto the plate.
7 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
E Tip: In low-contrast 
areas, you may want to 
click to place your own 
fastening points. You 
can add as many as you 
need. To remove the 
most recent fastening 
point, press Delete, and 
then move the mouse 
back to the remaining 
fastening point and 
continue selecting.

84 
lesson 3 Working with selections
separating portions of an  
image into different files
To quickly create multiple images from one scan, use the Crop And Straighten 
Photos command. Images with a clearly delineated outline and a uniform back-
ground—such as the 03Start.psd file—work best. To try it, open the 03Start.psd file 
in the Lesson03 folder, and choose File > Automate > Crop And Straighten Photos. 
Photoshop automatically crops each image in the start file and creates individual 
Photoshop files for each. You can close each file without saving.
	
Result
Cropping an image and erasing 
within a selection
Now that your composition is in place, you’ll crop the image to a final size and 
clean up some of the background scraps left behind when you moved selections. 
You can use either the Crop tool or the Crop command to crop an image. 
1 Select the Crop tool ( ), or press C to switch from the current tool to the Crop 
tool. Photoshop creates a crop boundary around the entire image.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 85
2 In the options bar, choose Unconstrained, and then select Delete Cropped Pixels. 
With Unconstrained selected, you can crop the image with any proportions.
3 Drag the crop handles so that the plate is in the highlighted area, deleting the 
backgrounds and drop shadows that were left behind from the items that were 
arranged outside the plate.
4 When you’re satisfied with the position of the crop area, click the Commit 
Current Crop Operation button ( ) in the options bar. 
The cropped image may include some scraps of the background from which you 
selected and removed shapes. You’ll fix that next.
5 If a scrap of background color or leftover drop shadow protrudes into the 
composition, use the Rectangular Marquee tool ( ) or the Lasso tool ( ) to 
select it. Be careful not to include any part of the image that you want to keep.
6 Select the Eraser tool (
) in the Tools panel, and then make sure that the 
foreground and background color swatches in the Tools panel are set to the 
defaults: black in the foreground and white in the background.
7 In the options bar, open the Brushes pop-up panel, and specify an 80-pixel 
brush with 100% hardness. 

86 
lesson 3 Working with selections
8 Drag the Eraser tool across the area you want to remove. You can erase quickly, 
because the Eraser tool affects only the selected area.
9 Repeat steps 5–8 to remove any other unwanted scraps of background.

softening the edges of a selection
To smooth the hard edges of a selection, you can apply anti-aliasing or feathering, 
or use the Refine Edge option.
Anti-aliasing smooths the jagged edges of a selection by softening the color transi-
tion between edge pixels and background pixels. Since only the edge pixels change, 
no detail is lost. Anti-aliasing is useful when cutting, copying, and pasting selections 
to create composite images. 
Anti-aliasing is available for the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magnetic Lasso, Elliptical 
Marquee, and Magic Wand tools. (Select the tool to display its options in the options 
bar.) To apply anti-aliasing, you must select the option before making the selection. 
Once a selection is made, you cannot add anti-aliasing to it. 
Feathering blurs edges by building a transition boundary between the selection 
and its surrounding pixels. This blurring can cause some loss of detail at the edge of 
the selection. 
You can define feathering for the marquee and lasso tools as you use them, or you 
can add feathering to an existing selection. Feathering effects become apparent 
when you move, cut, or copy the selection.
Once you have a selection, you can use the Refine Edge option to smooth the out-
line, feather it, or contract or expand it. Click Refine Edge in the options bar to open 
its dialog box.
• 
To use anti-aliasing, select a lasso tool, or the Elliptical Marquee or Magic Wand 
tool, and select Anti-alias in the options bar. 
• 
To define a feathered edge for a selection tool, select any of the lasso or 
marquee tools. Enter a Feather value in the options bar. This value defines the 
width of the feathered edge and can range from 1 to 250 pixels.
• 
To define a feathered edge for an existing selection, choose Select > Modify > 
Feather. Enter a value for the Feather Radius, and click OK.

review questions
1 Once you’ve made a selection, what area of the image can be edited? 
2 How do you add to and subtract from a selection?
3 How can you move a selection while you’re drawing it? 
4 When drawing a selection with the Lasso tool, how should you finish drawing the 
selection to ensure it’s the shape you want? 
5 What does the Quick Selection tool do?
6 How does the Magic Wand tool determine which areas of an image to select? What is 
tolerance, and how does it affect a selection?
review answers
1 Only the area within an active selection can be edited. 
2 To add to a selection, click the Add To Selection button in the options bar, and then 
click the area you want to add. To subtract from a selection, click the Subtract From 
Selection button in the options bar, and then click the area you want to subtract. You 
can also add to a selection by pressing Shift as you drag or click; to subtract, press Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you drag or click. 
3 To reposition a selection, without releasing the mouse button, hold down the spacebar 
and drag. 
4 To make sure that the selection is the shape you want when you use the Lasso tool, 
end the selection by dragging across the starting point of the selection. If you start and 
stop the selection at different points, Photoshop draws a straight line between the start 
point of the selection and the end point of the selection. 
5 The Quick Selection tool expands outward from where you click to automatically find 
and follow defined edges in the image.
6 The Magic Wand tool selects adjacent pixels based on their similarity in color. The 
Tolerance value determines how many color tones the Magic Wand tool will select. 
The higher the tolerance setting, the more tones are selected.

Adobe Photoshop lets you isolate different parts of 
an image on layers. Each layer can then be edited as 
discrete artwork, allowing tremendous flexibility in 
composing and revising an image.

lesson 4 
layer basics
about layers
Every Photoshop file contains one or more layers. New files are generally created 
with a background layer, which contains a color or an image that shows through 
the transparent areas of subsequent layers. All new layers in an image are transpar-
ent until you add text or artwork (pixel values). 
Working with layers is analogous to placing portions of a drawing on clear sheets 
of film, such as those viewed with an overhead projector: Individual sheets may 
be edited, repositioned, and deleted without affecting the other sheets. When the 
sheets are stacked, the entire composition is visible. 
Getting started
You’ll start the lesson by viewing an image of the final composition.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Click the Mini Bridge tab to open the Mini Bridge panel. If Bridge isn’t running 
in the background, click Launch Bridge.
4 In the Mini Bridge panel, choose Favorites from the pop-up menu on the left.
5 In the Favorites panel, double-click the Lessons folder, and then double-click 
the Lesson04 folder. 
6 In the Content panel, select the 04End.psd file. Press the spacebar for a full-
screen view.
This layered composite represents a postcard. You will create it now, and, in doing 
so, learn how to create, edit, and manage layers.
7 Press the spacebar again to return to the Mini Bridge panel, and then double-
click the 04Start.psd file to open it in Photoshop.
8 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 04Working.psd, and click Save. Click 
OK if you see the Photoshop Format Options dialog box. 
Saving another version of the start file frees you to make changes without worrying 
about overwriting the original.

using the Layers panel
The Layers panel lists all the layers in an image, displaying the layer names and 
thumbnails of the content on each layer. You can use the Layers panel to hide,  
view, reposition, delete, rename, and merge layers. The layer thumbnails are  
automatically updated as you edit the layers. 
1 If the Layers panel is not visible in the work area, choose Window > Layers. 
The Layers panel lists five layers for the 04Working.psd file (from top to bottom): 
Postage, HAWAII, Flower, Pineapple, and Background. 
2 Select the Background layer to make it active (if it’s not already selected).  
Notice the layer thumbnail and the icons on the Background layer level:
• The lock icon ( ) indicates that the layer is protected. 
• The eye icon ( ) indicates that the layer is visible in the image window.  
If you click the eye, the image window no longer displays that layer. 
The first task for this project is to add a photo of the beach to the postcard. First, 
you’ll open the beach image in Photoshop.
E Tip: Use the context 
menu to hide or resize 
the layer thumbnail. 
Right-click (Windows)  
or Control-click  
(Mac OS) a thumbnail 
in the Layers panel to 
open the context menu, 
and then choose a 
thumbnail size.

3 In the Mini Bridge panel, double-click the Beach.psd file in the Lesson04  
folder to open it in Photoshop.
The Layers panel changes to display the layer information for the active  
Beach.psd file. Notice that only one layer appears in the Beach.psd image:  
Layer 1, not Background. (For more information, see the sidebar, “About the  
background layer.”) 
about the background layer
When you create a new image with a white or colored background, the bottom layer in 
the Layers panel is named Background. An image can have only one background. You 
cannot change the stacking order of a background layer, its blending mode, or its opac-
ity. You can, however, convert a background layer to a regular layer.
When you create a new image with transparent content, the image doesn’t have a back-
ground layer. The bottom layer isn’t constrained like the background layer; you can move 
it anywhere in the Layers panel, and change its opacity and blending mode.
to convert a background layer into a regular layer: 
1 
Double-click the name Background in the Layers panel, or choose Layer >  
New > Layer From Background.
2 
Rename the layer, and set any other layer options.
3 
Click OK.
to convert a regular layer into a background layer:
1 
Select a layer in the Layers panel.
2 
Choose Layer > New > Background From Layer.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 95
renaming and copying a layer 
To add content to an image and simultaneously create a new layer for it, drag an 
object or layer from one file into the image window of another file. Whether you 
drag from the image window of the original file or from its Layers panel, only the 
active layer is reproduced in the destination file. 
You’ll drag the Beach.psd image onto the 04Working.psd file. Before you begin, 
make sure that both the 04Working.psd and Beach.psd files are open, and that the 
Beach.psd file is selected. 
First, you’ll give Layer 1 a more descriptive name. 
1 In the Layers panel, double-click the name Layer 1, type Beach, and then press 
Enter or Return. Keep the layer selected.
2 Choose Window > Arrange > 2-Up Vertical. Photoshop displays both of the 
open image files. Select the Beach.psd image so that it is the active file.
3 Select the Move tool (
), and use it to drag the Beach.psd image onto the 
04Working.psd image window.
E Tip: If you hold  
down Shift as you 
drag an image from 
one file into another, 
the dragged image 
automatically centers 
itself in the target 
image window. 

96 
lesson 4 
layer basics
The Beach layer now appears in the 04Working.psd file image window and its 
Layers panel, between the Background and Pineapple layers. Photoshop always 
adds new layers directly above the selected layer; you selected the Background  
layer earlier.
4 Close the Beach.psd file without saving changes to it.
5 Double-click the Mini Bridge tab to close the panel.
Viewing individual layers
The 04Working.psd file now contains six layers. Some of the layers are visible and 
some are hidden. The eye icon ( ) next to a layer thumbnail in the Layers panel 
indicates that the layer is visible.
1 Click the eye icon ( ) next to the Pineapple layer to hide the image of the 
pineapple. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 97
You can hide or show a layer by clicking this icon or clicking in its column—also 
called the Show/Hide Visibility column. 
2 Click again in the Show/Hide Visibility column to display the pineapple.
adding a border to a layer
Now you’ll add a white border around the Beach layer to create the impression  
that it’s a photograph.
1 Select the Beach layer. (To select the layer, click the layer name in the  
Layers panel.) 
The layer is highlighted, indicating that it is active. Changes you make in the  
image window affect the active layer.
2 To make the opaque areas on this layer more obvious, hide all layers except  
the Beach layer: Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you click the eye 
icon ( ) next to the Beach layer. 
The white background and other objects in the image disappear, leaving only the 
beach image against a checkerboard background. The checkerboard indicates trans-
parent areas of the active layer.
3 Choose Layer > Layer Style > Stroke.
The Layer Style dialog box opens. Now you’ll select the options for the white stroke 
around the beach image.

4 Specify the following settings:
• Size: 5 px
• Position: Inside
• Blend Mode: Normal
• Opacity: 100%
• Color: White (Click the Color box, and select white in the Color Picker.)
5 Click OK. A white border appears around the beach photo.
rearranging layers
The order in which the layers of an image are organized is called the stacking order. 
The stacking order determines how the image is viewed—you can change the order 
to make certain parts of the image appear in front of or behind other layers. 
You’ll rearrange the layers so that the beach image is in front of another image that 
is currently hidden in the file.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 99
1 Make the Postage, HAWAII, Flower, Pineapple and Background layers visible by 
clicking the Show/Hide Visibility column next to their layer names. 
The beach image is almost entirely blocked by images on other layers.
2 In the Layers panel, drag the Beach layer up so that it is positioned between the 
Pineapple and Flower layers—when you’ve positioned it correctly, you’ll see a 
thick line between the layers in the panel—and then release the mouse button. 
The Beach layer moves up one level in the stacking order, and the beach image 
appears on top of the pineapple and background images, but under the flower  
and “HAWAII.”
E Tip: You can also 
control the stacking 
order of layered images 
by selecting them 
in the Layers panel 
and choosing Layer > 
Arrange, and then 
choosing Bring To 
Front, Bring Forward, 
Send To Back, or Send 
Backward.

lesson 4 
layer basics
Changing the opacity of a layer
You can reduce the opacity of any layer to let other layers show through it. In this 
case, the postmark is too dark on the flower. You’ll edit the opacity of the Postage 
layer to let the flower and other images show through. 
1 Select the Postage layer, and then click the arrow next to the Opacity box to 
display the Opacity slider. Drag the slider to 25%. You can also type the value in 
the Opacity box or scrub the Opacity label.
The Postage layer becomes partially transparent, so you can see the other layers 
underneath. Notice that the change in opacity affects only the image area of the 
Postage layer. The Pineapple, Beach, Flower and HAWAII layers remain opaque.
2 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Duplicating a layer and changing the blending mode
You can apply different blending modes to a layer. Blending modes affect how the 
color pixels on one layer blend with pixels in the layers underneath. First you’ll use 
blending modes to increase the intensity of the image on the Pineapple layer so that 
it doesn’t look so dull. Then you’ll change the blending mode on the Postage layer. 
(Currently, the blending mode for both layers is Normal.)
1 Click the eye icons next to the HAWAII, Flower, and Beach layers to hide them.
2 Right-click or Control-click the Pineapple layer, and choose Duplicate Layer from 
the context menu. (Make sure you click the layer name, not its thumbnail, or you’ll 
see the wrong context menu.) Click OK in the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
A layer called “Pineapple copy” appears above the Pineapple layer in the  
Layers panel.

evangelist
Blending effects
Blending layers in different order or a different grouping changes the effect. You 
can apply a blending mode to an entire layer group and get a very different result 
than if you apply the same blending mode to each of the layers individually. When 
a blending mode is applied to a group, Photoshop treats the group as a single 
merged object and then applies the blending mode. Experiment with blending 
modes to get the effect you want.

102 
lesson 4 
layer basics
3 With the Pineapple copy layer selected, choose Overlay from the Blending 
Modes menu in the Layers panel. 
The Overlay blending mode blends the Pineapple copy layer with the Pineapple 
layer beneath it to create a vibrant, more colorful pineapple with deeper shadows 
and brighter highlights.
4 Select the Postage layer, and choose Multiply from the Blending Modes menu. 
The Multiply blending mode multiplies the colors in the underlying layers with 
the color in the top layer. In this case, the postmark becomes a little stronger.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work.
resizing and rotating layers
You can resize and transform layers.
1 Click the Visibility column on the Beach layer to make it visible. 
2 Select the Beach layer in the Layers panel, and then choose Edit > Free 
Transform. A Transform bounding box appears around the beach image.  
The bounding box has handles on each corner and each side.
E Tip: For more 
about blending modes, 
including definitions 
and visual examples, 
see Photoshop Help. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 103
First, you’ll resize and angle the layer. 
3 Press Shift as you drag a corner handle inward to scale the beach photo down 
by about 50%. (Watch the Width and Height percentages in the options bar.)
4 With the bounding box still active, position the pointer just outside one of the 
corner handles until it becomes a curved double arrow. Drag clockwise to rotate 
the beach image approximately 15 degrees. You can also enter 15 in the Set 
Rotation box in the options bar.
5 Click the Commit Transform button ( ) in the options bar.
6 Make the Flower layer visible. Then, select the Move tool (
), and drag the 
beach photo so that its corner is tucked neatly beneath the flower, as in the 
illustration.
7 Choose File > Save.

104 
lesson 4 
layer basics
using a filter to create artwork
Next, you’ll create a new layer with no artwork on it. (Adding empty layers to a file 
is comparable to adding blank sheets of acetate to a stack of images.) You’ll use this 
layer to add realistic-looking clouds to the sky with a Photoshop filter.
1 In the Layers panel, select the Background layer to make it active, and then click 
the New Layer button ( ) at the bottom of the Layers panel. 
A new layer, named Layer 1, appears between the Background and Pineapple layers. 
The layer has no content, so it has no effect on the image.
2 Double-click the name Layer 1, type Clouds, and press Enter or Return to 
rename the layer. 
3 In the Tools panel, click the Foreground Color swatch, select a sky 
blue color from the Color Picker, and click OK. We selected a color 
with the following values: R=48, G=138, and B=174. The Background 
Color remains white. 
4 With the Clouds layer still active, choose Filter > Render > Clouds. Realistic-
looking clouds appear behind the image.
5 Choose File > Save.
 Note: You can also 
create a new layer by 
choosing Layer >  
New > Layer, or by 
choosing New Layer 
from the Layers 
panel menu. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 105
Dragging to add a new layer
You can add a layer to an image by dragging an image file from the desktop, Bridge, 
or Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac OS). You’ll add another flower to the 
postcard now.
1 If Photoshop fills your monitor, reduce the size of the Photoshop window: 
• In Windows, click the Maximize/Restore button (
) in the upper right 
corner, and then drag the lower right corner of the Photoshop window to 
make it smaller. 
• In Mac OS, click the green Maximize/Restore button (
) in the upper left 
corner of the image window. 
2 In Photoshop, select the Pineapple copy layer in the Layers panel to make it the 
active layer.
3 In Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac OS), navigate to the Lessons  
folder you copied from the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD. 
Then navigate to the Lesson04 folder.
4 Select Flower2.psd, and drag it from Explorer or the Finder onto your image. 
The Flower2 layer appears in the Layers panel, directly above the Pineapple  
copy layer. Photoshop places the image as a Smart Object, which is a layer you 
can edit without making permanent changes. You’ll work with Smart Objects in 
Lessons 5 and 8. 

106 
lesson 4 
layer basics
5 Position the Flower2 layer in the lower left corner of the postcard, so that about 
half of the flower is visible.
6 Click the Commit Transform button (
) in the options bar to accept the layer.
adding text
Now you’re ready to create some type using the Horizontal Type tool, which places 
the text on its own type layer. You’ll then edit the text and apply a special effect.
1 Make the HAWAII layer visible. You’ll add text just below this layer, and apply 
special effects to both layers.
2 Choose Select > Deselect Layers, so that no layers are selected.
3 Click the Foreground Color swatch in the Tools panel, and then select a shade  
of grassy green in the Color Picker. Click OK to close the Color Picker.
4 In the Tools panel, select the Horizontal Type tool ( ). Then, choose Window > 
Character to open the Character panel. Do the following in the Character panel:
• Select a serif font (we used Birch Std).
• Select a font style (we used Regular).
• Select a large font size (we used 36 points). 
• Select Crisp from the Anti-aliasing  
menu ( ).
• Select a large tracking value ( )  
(we used 250).
• Click the All Caps button (
).
• Click the Faux Bold button ( ).

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 107
5 Click just below the “H” in the word “HAWAII,” and type Island Paradise. 
Then click the Commit Any Current Edits button ( ) in the options bar.
The Layers panel now includes a layer named Island Paradise with a “T” thumbnail, 
indicating that it is a type layer. This layer is at the top of the layer stack.
The text appears where you clicked, which probably isn’t exactly where you want  
it to be positioned.
6 Select the Move tool (
), and drag the “Island Paradise” text so that it is 
centered below “HAWAII.”
 Note: If you make a 
mistake when you click 
to set the type, simply 
click away from the type 
and repeat step 5.

108 
lesson 4 
layer basics
applying a gradient to a layer
You can apply a color gradient to all or part of a layer. In this example, you’ll apply a 
gradient to the HAWAII type to make it more colorful. First you’ll select the letters, 
and then you’ll apply the gradient.
1 Select the HAWAII layer in the Layers panel to make it active.
2 Right-click or Control-click the thumbnail in the HAWAII layer, and choose 
Select Pixels. Everything on the HAWAII layer (the white lettering) is selected.
Now that you’ve selected the area to fill, you’ll apply a gradient.
3 In the Tools panel, select the Gradient tool (
).
4 Click the Foreground Color swatch in the Tools panel, select a bright color  
of orange in the Color Picker, and click OK. The Background Color should still 
be white.
5 In the options bar, make sure that Linear Gradient (
) is selected. 
6 In the options bar, click the arrow next to the Gradient Editor box to open the 
gradient picker. Select the Foreground To Background swatch (it’s the first one), 
and then click anywhere outside the gradient picker to close it. 
7 With the selection still active, drag the Gradient tool from the bottom to the top 
of the letters. If you want to be sure you drag straight up, press the Shift key as 
you drag.
E Tip: To list the 
gradient options by 
name rather than 
by sample, click the 
gradient picker menu 
button, and choose 
either Small List or 
Large List. Or, hover 
the pointer over a 
thumbnail until a tool 
tip appears, showing 
the gradient name.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 109
The gradient extends across the type, starting with orange at the bottom and  
gradually blending to white at the top.
8 Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the HAWAII type.
9 Save the work you’ve done so far.
applying a layer style
You can enhance a layer by adding a shadow, stroke, satin sheen, or other special 
effect from a collection of automated and editable layer styles. These styles are easy 
to apply and link directly to the layer you specify. 
Like layers, layer styles can be hidden by clicking eye icons ( ) in the Layers panel. 
Layer styles are nondestructive, so you can edit or remove them at any time. You 
can apply a copy of a layer style to a different layer by dragging the effect onto the 
destination layer.
Earlier, you used a layer style to add a stroke to the beach photo. Now, you’ll add 
drop shadows to the text to make it stand out. 
1 Select the Island Paradise layer, and then choose Layer > Layer Style >  
Drop Shadow. 
2 In the Layer Style dialog box, make sure that the Preview option is selected, and 
then, if necessary, move the dialog box so that you can see the Island Paradise 
text in the image window. 
E Tip: You can also 
open the Layer Style 
dialog box by clicking 
the Add A Layer Style  
button at the bottom 
of the Layers panel and 
then choosing a layer 
style, such as Bevel 
And Emboss, from the 
pop-up menu.

3 In the Structure area, select Use Global Light, and then specify the following 
settings:
• Blend Mode: Multiply
• Opacity: 75%
• Angle: 78 degrees
• Distance: 5 px
• Spread: 30%
• Size: 10 px
Photoshop adds a drop shadow to the “Island Paradise” text in the image.
4  Click OK to accept the settings and close the Layer Style dialog box. 
Photoshop nests the layer style in the Island Paradise layer. First it lists Effects, and 
then the layer styles applied to the layer. An eye icon ( ) appears next to the effect 
category and next to each effect. To turn off an effect, click the eye icon. Click the 
visibility column again to restore the effect. To hide all layer styles, click the eye 
icon next to Effects. To collapse the list of effects, click the arrow next to the layer.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 111
5 Make sure that eye icons appear for both items nested in the Island Paradise layer.
6 Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) and drag the Effects line or the fx 
symbol ( ) onto the HAWAII layer. The Drop Shadow layer style is applied to 
the HAWAII layer, using the same settings you applied to the Island Paradise 
layer. 
Now you’ll add a green stroke around the word HAWAII.
7 Select the HAWAII layer in the Layers panel, click the Add A Layer Style button 
( ) at the bottom of the panel, and choose Stroke from the pop-up menu. 
8 In the Structure area of the Layer Styles dialog box, specify the following 
settings:
• Size: 4 px
• Position: Outside
• Blend Mode: Normal
• Opacity: 100%
• Color: Green (Select a shade that goes well with the one you used for the 
“Island Paradise” text.)

112 
lesson 4 
layer basics
9 Click OK to apply the stroke.
Now you’ll add a drop shadow and a satin sheen to the flower.
10 Select the Flower layer, and choose Layer > Layer Style > Drop Shadow. Then 
change the following settings in the Structure area: 
• Opacity: 60%
• Distance: 13 px
• Spread: 9%. 
• Make sure Use Global Light is selected, and that the Blend Mode is Multiply.  
Do not click OK.
11 With the Layer Style dialog box still open, select Satin on the left. Then make 
sure Invert is selected, and apply the following settings: 
• Color (next to Blend Mode): Fuchsia (choose a color that complements the 
flower color)

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 113
• Opacity: 20%
• Distance: 22 px
12 Click OK to apply both layer styles.
adding an adjustment layer
Adjustment layers can be added to an image to apply color and tonal adjustments 
without permanently changing the pixel values in the image. For example, if you 
add a Color Balance adjustment layer to an image, you can experiment with differ-
ent colors repeatedly, because the change occurs only on the adjustment layer. If 
you decide to return to the original pixel values, you can hide or delete the adjust-
ment layer. 
You’ve used adjustment layers in other lessons. Here, you’ll add a Hue/Saturation 
adjustment layer to change the color of the purple flower. An adjustment layer 
affects all layers below it in the image’s stacking order unless a selection is active 
when you create it or you create a clipping mask.

114 
lesson 4 
layer basics
1 Select the Flower2 layer in the Layers panel.
2 Click the Hue/Saturation icon in the Adjustments panel to add a Hue/Saturation 
adjustment layer.
3 In the Properties panel, apply the following settings
• Hue: 43
• Saturation: 19
• Lightness: 0
The changes affect the Flower2, Pineapple Copy, Pineapple, Clouds, and 
Background layers. The effect is interesting, but you only want to change the 
Flower2 layer.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 115
4 Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) the Hue/Saturation adjustment 
layer, and choose Create Clipping Mask. 
An arrow appears in the Layers panel indicating that the adjustment layer applies 
only to the Flower2 layer. You’ll learn more about clipping masks in Lessons 6 and 7.
updating layer effects
Layer effects are automatically updated when you make changes to a layer. You can 
edit the text and watch how the layer effect tracks the change. First, you’ll use the 
new search feature in the Layers panel to isolate the text layer.
1 In the Layers panel, choose Kind from the Pick A Filter Type menu.
The filter type determines the search options available to you.
2 Select the Filter For Type Layers button from the  
filter options at the top of the Layers panel.
Only the Island Paradise layer is listed in the 
Layers panel. The search feature lets you find 
specific layers quickly, but has no effect on which 
layers are visible or their stacking order. 
3 Select the Island Paradise layer in the  
Layers panel.
4 In the Tools panel, select the Horizontal Type tool ( ).
5 In the options bar, set the font size to 32 points, and press Enter or Return. 
ETip: You can search 
for layers in the Layers 
panel by layer type, 
layer name, effect, 
mode, attribute, and 
color. When you work 
in a complex file with 
numerous layers, 
searching for the layer 
you need can save  
you time. 

116 
lesson 4 
layer basics
Although you didn’t select the text by dragging the Type tool (as you would have to 
do in a word-processing program), “Island Paradise” now appears in 32-point type. 
6 Using the Horizontal Type tool, click between “Island” and “Paradise,” and  
type of. 
As you edit the text, the layer styles are applied to the new text.
7 You don’t actually need the word “of,”  
so delete it.
8 Select the Move tool (
) and drag 
“Island Paradise” to center it beneath  
the word “HAWAII.”
\
9 Click the red Filtering On/Off button at the top of the Layers panel to toggle 
filtering off and see all the layers in the file. 
10 Choose File > Save.
adding a border
The Hawaii postcard is nearly done. The elements are almost all arranged correctly 
in the composition. You’ll finish up by positioning the postmark and then adding a 
white postcard border.
1 Select the Postage layer, and then use the Move tool (
) to drag it to the middle 
right of the image, as in the illustration.
 Note: You don’t 
have to click the 
Commit Any Current 
Edits button after 
making any text edits, 
because selecting the 
Move tool has the same 
effect.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 117
2 Select the Island Paradise layer in the Layers panel, and then click the Create A 
New Layer button ( ) at the bottom of the panel. 
3  Choose Select > All.
4 Choose Select > Modify > Border. In the Border Selection dialog box, type 10
pixels for the Width, and click OK. 
A 10-pixel border is selected around the entire image. Now, you’ll fill it with white.
5 Select white for the Foreground Color, and then choose Edit > Fill.
6 In the Fill dialog box, choose Foreground Color from the Use menu, and  
click OK.
7 Choose Select > Deselect.
8 Double-click the Layer 1 name in the Layers panel, and rename the layer Border.

lesson 4 
layer basics
Flattening and saving files
When you finish editing all the layers in your image, you can merge or flatten layers 
to reduce the file size. Flattening combines all the layers into a single background 
layer. However, you cannot edit layers once you’ve flattened them, so you shouldn’t 
flatten an image until you are certain that you’re satisfied with all your design deci-
sions. Rather than flattening your original PSD files, it’s a good idea to save a copy of 
the file with its layers intact, in case you need to edit a layer later.
To appreciate what flattening does, notice the two numbers for the file size in the 
status bar at the bottom of the image window. The first number represents what the 
file size would be if you flattened the 
image. The second number represents the 
file size without flattening. This lesson file, 
if flattened, would be about 2.29 MB, but 
the current file is actually much larger—
about 27 MB. So flattening is well worth it 
in this case. 
1 Select any tool but the Type tool ( ), to be sure that you’re not in text-editing 
mode. Then choose File > Save (if it is available) to be sure that all your changes 
have been saved in the file.
2 Choose Image > Duplicate.
3 In the Duplicate Image dialog box, name the file 04Flat.psd, and click OK.
4 Leave the 04Flat.psd file open, but close the 04Working.psd file.
5 Choose Flatten Image from the Layers panel menu. 
Only one layer, named Background, remains in the Layers panel.
6 Choose File > Save. Even though you chose Save rather than Save As, the Save 
As dialog box appears.
7 Make sure the location is the Lessons/Lesson04 folder, and then click Save to 
accept the default settings and save the flattened file.
You have saved two versions of the file: a one-layer, flattened copy as well as the 
original file, in which all the layers remain intact.
 Note: If the sizes do 
not appear in the status 
bar, click the status bar 
pop-up menu arrow 
and choose Show > 
Document Sizes.
E Tip: If you want to 
flatten only some of the 
layers in a file, click the 
eye icons to hide  
the layers you don’t 
want to flatten, and 
then choose Merge 
Visible from the Layers  
panel menu.

about layer comps
Layer comps provide one-click flexibility in switching between different views of 
a multilayered image file. A layer comp is simply a definition of the settings in the 
Layers panel. Once you’ve defined a layer comp, you can change as many settings 
as you please in the Layers panel and then create another layer comp to preserve 
that configuration of layer properties. Then, by switching from one layer comp 
to another, you can quickly review the two designs. The beauty of layer comps 
becomes apparent when you want to demonstrate a number of possible design 
arrangements. When you’ve created a few layer comps, you can review the design 
variations without having to tediously select and deselect eye icons or change set-
tings in the Layers panel. 
Say, for example, that you are designing a brochure, and you’re producing a version 
in English as well as in French. You might have the French text on one layer, and the 
English text on another in the same image file. To create two different layer comps, 
you would simply turn on visibility for the French layer and turn off visibility for the 
English layer, and then click the Create New Layer Comp button on the Layer Comps 
panel. Then you’d do the inverse—turn on visibility for the English layer and turn 
off visibility for the French layer, and click the Create New Layer Comp button—to 
create an English layer comp.
To view the different layer comps, click the Apply Layer Comp box for each comp 
in the Layer Comps panel in turn. With a little imagination, you can appreciate how 
much time this saves for more complex variations. Layer comps can be an especially 
valuable feature when the design is in flux or when you need to create multiple ver-
sions of the same image file.
You’ve created a colorful, attractive postcard. This lesson only begins to explore 
the vast possibilities and the flexibility you gain when you master the art of using 
Photoshop layers. You’ll get more experience and try out different techniques for 
layers in almost every chapter as you move forward in this book.

review questions
1 What is the advantage of using layers? 
2 When you create a new layer, where does it appear in the Layers panel stack?
3 How can you make artwork on one layer appear in front of artwork on another layer?
4 How can you apply a layer style?
5 When you’ve completed your artwork, what can you do to minimize the file size 
without changing the quality or dimensions? 
review answers
1 Layers let you move and edit different parts of an image as discrete objects. You can 
also hide individual layers as you work on other layers.
2 A new layer always appears immediately above the active layer. 
3 You can make artwork on one layer appear in front of artwork on another layer by 
dragging layers up or down the stacking order in the Layers panel, or by using the  
Layer > Arrange subcommands—Bring To Front, Bring Forward, Send To Back, and 
Send Backward. However, you can’t change the layer position of a background layer.
4 To apply a layer style, select the layer, and then click the Add A Layer Style button  
in the Layers panel, or choose Layer > Layer Style > [style].
5 To minimize file size, you can flatten the image, which merges all the layers onto a 
single background. It’s a good idea to duplicate image files with layers intact before you 
flatten them, in case you have to make changes to a layer later.

lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll edit several digital images using Photoshop and Adobe Camera 
Raw, which comes with Photoshop. You’ll use a variety of techniques to touch up 
and improve the appearance of digital photographs. You’ll start by viewing the 
before and after images in Adobe Bridge.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 In the Favorites panel in Bridge, click the Lessons folder. Then, in the Content 
panel, double-click the Lesson05 folder to open it.
5 Adjust the thumbnail slider, if necessary, so that you can see the thumbnail 
previews clearly. Then look at the 05A_Start.crw and 05A_End.psd files.
	
05A_End.psd
The original photograph of a Spanish-style church is a camera raw file, so it doesn’t 
have the usual .psd file extension you’ve worked with so far in this book. It was shot 
with a Canon Digital Rebel camera and has the Canon proprietary .crw file exten-
sion instead. You’ll process this proprietary camera raw image to make it brighter, 
sharper, and clearer, and then save it as a JPEG file for the web and as a PSD file so 
that you could work on it further in Photoshop.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 127
6 Compare the 05B_Start.psd and 05B_End.psd thumbnail previews.
	
05B_End.psd
You’ll perform color corrections and image enhancements in Photoshop to achieve 
the end result.
7 Look at the 05C_Start.psd and 05C_End.psd thumbnail previews.
	
05C_End.psd
You’ll make several corrections to this portrait of a girl on the beach, including 
bringing out shadow and highlight detail, removing red eye, and sharpening  
the image.

8 Look at the 05D_Start.psd and 05D_End.psd thumbnail previews.
	
05D_End.psd
The original image is distorted, with the columns appearing to be bowed.  
You’ll correct the lens barrel distortion.
9 Look at the 05E_Start.psd and 05E_End.psd thumbnail previews.
	
05E_End.psd
The first image has two layers. Depending on which layer is visible, either the  
glass in the foreground or the beach in the background is in focus. You’ll extend  
the depth of field to make both clear. You’ll also add posts and apply an iris blur  
to the glass.

about camera raw files
A camera raw file contains unprocessed picture data from a digital camera’s image 
sensor. Many digital cameras can save images in camera raw format. The advan-
tage of camera raw files is that they let the photographer—rather than the cam-
era—interpret the image data and make adjustments and conversions. (In contrast, 
shooting JPEG images with your camera locks you into your camera’s processing.) 
Because the camera doesn’t do any image processing when you shoot a camera 
raw photo, you can use Adobe Camera Raw to set the white balance, tonal range, 
contrast, color saturation, and sharpening. Think of camera raw files as photo nega-
tives. You can go back and reprocess the file any time you like to achieve the results 
you want.
To create camera raw files, set your digital camera to save files in its own, possibly 
proprietary, raw file format. When you download the file from your camera, it has  
a file extension such as .nef (from Nikon) or .crw (from Canon). In Bridge or 
Photoshop, you can process camera raw files from a myriad of supported digital 
cameras from Canon, Kodak, Leica, Nikon, and other makers—and even process 
multiple images simultaneously. You can then export the proprietary camera raw 
files to DNG, JPEG, TIFF, or PSD file format.
You can process camera raw files obtained from supported cameras, but you can 
also open TIFF and JPEG images in Camera Raw, which includes some editing 
features that aren’t in Photoshop. However, you won’t have the same flexibility with 
white balance and other settings if you’re using a TIFF or JPEG image. Although 
Camera Raw can open and edit a camera raw image file, it cannot save an image in 
camera raw format.
You used Camera Raw to edit the color and lighting in an image in Lesson 2. In this 
exercise, you’ll take advantage of more of its features.
Processing files in Camera raw
When you make adjustments to an image in Camera Raw, such as straightening or 
cropping the image, Photoshop and Bridge preserve the original file data. This way, 
you can edit the image as you desire, export the edited image, and keep the original 
intact for future use or other adjustments.
Opening images in Camera raw
You can open Camera Raw from either Bridge or Photoshop, and you can apply the 
same edits to multiple files simultaneously. This is especially useful if you’re work-
ing with images that were all shot in the same environment, and which therefore 
need the same lighting and other adjustments. 
 Note: The Photoshop 
Raw format (.raw 
extension) is a file 
format for transferring 
images between 
applications and 
computer platforms. 
Don’t confuse 
Photoshop Raw with 
camera raw file formats.

lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
Camera Raw provides extensive controls for adjusting white balance, exposure, 
contrast, sharpness, tone curves, and much more. In this exercise, you’ll edit one 
image and then apply the settings to similar images.
1 In Bridge, open the Lessons/Lesson05/Mission folder, which contains three shots 
of the Spanish church you previewed earlier. 
2 Shift-click to select all of the images—Mission01.crw, Mission02.crw, and 
Mission03.crw—and then choose File > Open In Camera Raw.

The Camera Raw dialog box displays a large preview of the first image, and a 
filmstrip down the left side displays all open images. The histogram in the upper 
right corner shows the tonal range of the selected image; the workflow options link 
below the preview window displays the selected image’s color space, bit depth, size, 
and resolution. Tools along the top of the dialog box let you zoom, pan, straighten, 
and make other adjustments to the image. Tabbed panels on the right side of the 
dialog box give you more nuanced options for adjusting the image: You can correct 
the white balance, adjust the tone, sharpen the image, remove noise, adjust color, 
and make other changes. You can also save settings as a preset, and then apply 
them later.
For the best results using Camera Raw, plan your workflow to move from left to 
right and top to bottom. That is, you’ll often want to use the tools across the top 
first, and then move through the panels in order, making changes as necessary.
You will explore these controls now as you edit the first image file.

3 Click each thumbnail in the filmstrip to preview all the images before you begin. 
Or, you can click the Forward button under the main preview window to cycle 
through them. When you’ve seen all three, select the Mission01.crw image again.
4 Make sure that Preview is selected at the top of the dialog box, so that you can 
see the effect of the adjustments you’re about to make.
adjusting white balance
An image’s white balance reflects the lighting conditions under which it was cap-
tured. A digital camera records the white balance at the time of exposure; this is  
the value that initially appears in the Camera Raw dialog box image preview.
White balance comprises two components. The first is temperature, which is  
measured in kelvins and determines the level of “coolness” or “warmness” of  
the image—that is, its cool blue-green tones or warm yellow-red tones. The  
second component is tint, which compensates for magenta or green color casts  
in the image. 
Depending on the settings you’re using on your camera and the environment in 
which you’re shooting (for example, if there’s glare or uneven lighting), you may 
want to adjust the white balance for the image. If you plan to modify the white bal-
ance, make that the first thing you do, as it will affect all other changes in the image. 
1 If the Basic panel isn’t already displayed on the right side of the dialog box, click 
the Basic button (
) to open it. 
By default, As Shot is selected in the White 
Balance menu. Camera Raw applies the 
white balance settings that were in your 
camera at the time of exposure. Camera 
Raw includes several White Balance pre-
sets, which you can use as a starting point 
to see different lighting effects.
2 Choose Cloudy from the White Balance menu.
Camera Raw adjusts the temperature and tint for a cloudy day. Sometimes a preset 
does the trick. In this case, though, there’s still a blue cast to the image. You’ll 
adjust the white balance manually.
3 Select the White Balance tool (
) at the top of the Camera Raw dialog box.

132 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
To set an accurate white balance, select an object that should be white or gray. 
Camera Raw uses that information to determine the color of the light in which the 
scene was shot, and then adjusts for scene lighting automatically.
4 Click the white clouds in the image. The lighting of the image changes.
5 Click a different area of the clouds. The lighting shifts. 
You can use the White Balance tool to find the best lighting for the scene quickly 
and easily. Clicking different areas changes the lighting without making any perma-
nent changes to the file, so you can experiment freely. 
6 Click the clouds directly to the left of the steeple. This selection removes most of 
the color casts and results in realistic lighting.
7 Move the Tint slider to -22 to intensify the greens.
E Tip: To undo 
the settings, press 
Ctrl+Z (Windows) or 
Command+Z (Mac 
OS). To compare the 
changes you’ve made 
in the current panel 
with the original image, 
deselect Preview. Select 
Preview again to see the 
modified image.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 133
Making tonal adjustments in Camera raw
Other sliders in the Basic panel affect exposure, brightness, contrast, and satura-
tion in the image. Except for Contrast, moving a slider to the right lightens the 
affected areas of the image, and moving it to the left darkens those areas. Exposure 
essentially defines the white point, or the lightest point of the image, so that Camera 
Raw adjusts everything else accordingly. Conversely, the Blacks slider sets the 
black point, or the darkest point in the image. The Highlights and Shadows sliders 
increase detail in the highlights and the shadows, respectively.
The Contrast slider adjusts the contrast. For more nuanced contrast adjustments, 
you can use the Clarity slider, which adds depth to an image by increasing local 
contrast, especially on the midtones. 
The Saturation slider adjusts the saturation of all colors in the image equally. The 
Vibrance slider, on the other hand, has a greater effect on undersaturated colors, so 
you can bring life to a background without oversaturating skin tones, for example.
You can use the Auto option to let Camera Raw attempt to correct the image tone, 
or you can select your own settings.
1 Click Auto in the Basic panel.
Camera Raw increases the exposure and changes several other settings. You could 
use this as a starting point. However, in this exercise, you’ll return to the default 
settings and adjust them yourself.
2 Click Default in the Basic panel.
E Tip: For the best 
effect, increase the 
Clarity slider until you 
see halos near the edge 
details, and then reduce 
the setting slightly.

134 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
3 Change the sliders as follows:
• Leave Exposure at 0.00.
• Increase Contrast to 18.
• Leave Highlights at 0.00.
• Increase Shadows to +63.
• Decrease Whites to -2.
• Decrease Blacks to -18.
• Increase Clarity to +3.
• Increase Vibrance to +4.
• Decrease Saturation to -3.
These settings help pump up the midtones of the image, so that it looks bolder and 
more dimensional without being oversaturated. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 135
about the Camera raw histogram
The histogram in the upper right corner of the Camera Raw dialog box 
simultaneously shows the red, green, and blue channels of the selected image,  
and updates interactively as you adjust any settings. Also, as you move any tool 
over the preview image, the RGB values for the area under the cursor appear  
below the histogram. 
applying sharpening
Photoshop offers several sharpening filters, but when you need to sharpen an entire 
image, Camera Raw provides the best control. The sharpening controls are in the 
Detail panel. To see the effect of sharpening in the preview panel, you must view 
the image at 100% or greater.
1 Double-click the Zoom tool (
) on the left side of the toolbar to zoom in to 
100%. Then select the Hand tool (
), and pan the image to see the cross at the 
top of the mission tower.
2 Click the Detail tab (
) to open the Detail panel.
The Amount slider determines how much sharpening Camera Raw applies. 
Typically, you’ll want to exaggerate the amount of sharpening first, and then adjust 
it after you’ve set the other sliders.
3 Move the Amount slider to 100.
The Radius slider determines the pixel area Camera Raw analyzes as it sharpens the 
image. For most images, you’ll get the best results if you keep the radius low, even 
below one pixel, as a larger radius can begin to cause an unnatural look, almost like 
a watercolor.
4 Move the Radius slider to 0.9.
The Detail slider determines how much detail you’ll see. Even when this slider is 
set to 0, Camera Raw performs some sharpening. Typically, you’ll want to keep the 
Detail setting relatively low.
E Tip: If you want to 
make an adjustment 
to only a specific part 
of an image, use the 
Adjustment Brush 
tool or the Graduated 
Filter tool. With the 
Adjustment Brush tool, 
you can apply Exposure, 
Highlights, Clarity, and 
other adjustments by 
“painting” them onto 
the photo. With the 
Graduated Filter tool, 
you can apply the same 
types of adjustments 
gradually across a 
region of a photo.

136 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
5 Move the Detail slider to 25, if it isn’t already there.
The Masking slider determines which parts of the image Camera Raw sharpens. 
When the Masking value is high, Camera Raw sharpens only those parts of the 
image that have strong edges. 
6 Move the Masking slider to 61.
After you’ve adjusted the Radius, Detail, and Masking sliders, you can lower the 
Amount slider to finalize the sharpening. 
7 Decrease the Amount slider to 70.
Sharpening the image gives stronger definition to the details and edges. The 
Masking slider lets you target the sharpening effect to the lines in the image, so that 
artifacts don’t appear in unfocused or background areas.
When you make adjustments in Camera Raw, the original file data is preserved. 
Your adjustment settings for the image are stored either in the Camera Raw 
database file or in “sidecar” XMP files that accompany the original image file in 
the same folder. These XMP files retain the adjustments you made in Camera Raw 
when you move the image file to a storage medium or another computer.
synchronizing settings across images
All three of the mission images were shot at the same time under the same light-
ing conditions. Now that you’ve made the first one look stunning, you can auto-
matically apply the same settings to the other two images. You do this using the 
Synchronize command.
E Tip: Press Alt 
(Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) as you move 
the Masking slider to 
see what Camera Raw 
will sharpen. 
 Note: If you zoom 
out, the image won’t 
appear to be sharpened. 
You can preview 
sharpening effects only 
at zoom levels of 100% 
or greater.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 137
1 In the upper left corner of the Camera Raw dialog box, click Select All to select 
all of the images in the filmstrip.
2 Click the Synchronize button.
The Synchronize dialog box appears, listing all the settings you can apply to the 
images. By default, all options except Crop, Spot Removal, and Local Adjustments 
are selected. You can accept the default for this project, even though you didn’t 
change all the settings.
3 Click OK in the Synchronize dialog box.
When you synchronize the settings across all of the selected images, the thumbnails 
update to reflect the changes you made. To preview the images, click each thumb-
nail in the filmstrip.

saving Camera raw changes
You can save your changes in different ways for different purposes. First, you’ll save 
the images with adjustments as low-resolution JPEG files that you can share on the 
web. Then, you’ll save one image, Mission01, as a Photoshop file that you can open 
as a Smart Object in Photoshop. When you open an image as a Smart Object in 
Photoshop, you can return to Camera Raw at any time to make further adjustments. 
1 Click Select All in the Camera Raw dialog box to select all three images. 
2 Click Save Images in the lower left corner.
3 In the Save Options dialog box, do the following:
• Choose Save In Same Location from the Destination menu. 
• In the File Naming area, leave “Document Name” in the first box.
• Choose JPEG from the Format menu.
These settings will save your corrected images as smaller, downsampled JPEG files, 
which you can share with colleagues on the web. Your files will be named 
Mission01.jpg, Mission02.jpg, and Mission03.jpg.
4 Click Save.
 Note: Before 
sharing these images 
on the web, you would 
probably want to open 
them in Photoshop 
and resize them to 640 
x 480 pixels. They are 
currently much larger, 
and most viewers would 
need to scroll to see the 
full-size images.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 139
Bridge returns you to the Camera Raw dialog box, and indicates how many images 
have been processed until all the images have been saved. The CRW thumbnails still 
appear in the Camera Raw dialog box. In Bridge, however, you now also have JPEG 
versions as well as the original CRW image files, which you can continue to edit or 
leave for another time.
Now, you’ll open a copy of the Mission01 image in Photoshop. 
5 Select the Mission01.crw image thumbnail in the filmstrip in the Camera Raw 
dialog box. Then press the Shift key, and click Open Object at the bottom of the 
dialog box.
The Open Object button opens the image as a Smart Object in Photoshop, and you 
can return to Camera Raw to continue making adjustments at any time. If you click 
Open Image, the image opens as a standard Photoshop image. Pressing the Shift 
key changes the Open Image button to the Open Object button.
6 In Photoshop, choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, choose 
Photoshop for the Format, rename the file Mission_Final.psd, navigate to the 
Lesson05 folder, and click Save. Click OK if the Photoshop Format Options 
dialog box appears. Then close the file. 
E Tip: To make the 
Open Object button 
the default, click the 
workflow options link 
(in blue) below the 
preview window, select 
Open In Photoshop 
As Smart Objects, and 
click OK.

lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
about saving files in  
Camera raw
Every camera model saves raw images in a unique format, but Adobe Camera Raw 
can process many raw file formats. Camera Raw processes the raw files with default 
image settings based on built-in camera profiles for supported cameras and the 
EXIF data.
You can save the proprietary files in DNG format (the format saved by Adobe 
Camera Raw), JPEG, TIFF, and PSD. All of these formats can be used to save RGB and 
CMYK continuous-tone, bitmapped images, and all of them except DNG are also 
available in the Photoshop Save and Save As dialog boxes.
• 
The DNG (Adobe Digital Negative) format contains raw image data from a 
digital camera and metadata that defines what the image data means. DNG 
is meant to be an industry-wide standard format for raw image data, helping 
photographers manage the variety of proprietary raw formats and providing a 
compatible archival format. (You can save this format only from the Camera Raw 
dialog box.)
• 
The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file format is commonly used 
to display photographs and other continuous-tone RGB images on the web. 
Higher-resolution JPEG files may be used for other purposes, including high-
quality printing. JPEG format retains all color information in an image, but 
compresses file size by selectively discarding data. The greater the compression, 
the lower the image quality.
• 
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is used to exchange files between 
applications and computer platforms. TIFF is a flexible format supported by 
virtually all paint, image-editing, and page layout applications. Also, virtually all 
desktop scanners can produce TIFF images.
• 
PSD format is the Photoshop native file format. Because of the tight integration 
between Adobe products, other Adobe applications such as Adobe Illustrator 
and Adobe InDesign can directly import PSD files and preserve many Photoshop 
features. 
Once you open a file in Photoshop, you can save it in many different formats, 
including Large Document Format (PSB), Cineon, Photoshop Raw, or PNG. Not to 
be confused with camera raw file formats, the Photoshop Raw format (RAW) is a file 
format for transferring images between applications and computer platforms. 
For more information about file formats in Camera Raw and Photoshop, see 
Photoshop Help.

applying advanced color correction
You’ll use Levels, the Healing Brush tool, and other 
Photoshop features to enhance the image of this 
model.
adjusting levels
The tonal range of an image represents the amount 
of contrast, or detail, in the image and is deter-
mined by the image’s distribution of pixels, ranging 
from the darkest pixels (black) to the lightest pixels 
(white). You’ll use a Levels adjustment layer to fine-
tune the tonal range in this image.
1 In Photoshop, choose File > Open. Navigate to 
the Lesson05 folder, and double-click the 05B_Start.psd file to open it.
2 Choose File > Save As. Name the file Model_final.psd, and click Save. Click OK 
if you see the Photoshop Format Options dialog box.
3 Click the Levels button in the Adjustments panel. 
Photoshop adds a Levels adjustment layer to the Layers panel. The Levels controls 
and a histogram appear in the Adjustments panel. The histogram displays the 
range of dark and light values in the image. The left (black) triangle represents the 
shadows; the right (white) triangle represents the highlights; and the middle (gray) 
triangle represents the midtones, or gamma. Unless you’re aiming for a special 
effect, the ideal histogram has its black point at the beginning of the data and its 
white point at the end of the data, and the middle portion has fairly uniform peaks 
and valleys, representing adequate pixel data in the midtones.

4 Click the Calculate A More Accurate Histogram button (
) on the left side of 
the histogram. Photoshop replaces the histogram.
There is a single line on the far left side of the histogram, representing the current 
black point, but the bulk of the data begins further to the right. You want to set the 
black point to match the beginning of that data. 
5 Drag the left (black) triangle toward the right to the point where the histogram 
indicates the darkest colors begin.
As you drag, the first Input Levels value (beneath the histogram graph) changes, 
and so does the image itself. 
6 Pull the middle (gray) triangle a little bit to the left to slightly lighten the 
midtones. We moved it to a value of 1.18.

using the healing Brush tools to remove blemishes
Now you’re ready to give the model’s face some focused attention. You’ll use the 
Healing Brush and Spot Healing Brush tools to heal blemishes and freckles, remove 
red veins from the eyes, and clear hair from the face.
1 In the Layers panel, select the Background layer. Then, choose Duplicate  
Layer from the Layers panel menu. Name the layer Corrections, and  
click OK.
Working on a duplicate layer preserves the original pixels so you can make  
changes later.
2  Zoom in on the model’s face so that you can see it clearly—to at least 100%.
3 Select the Spot Healing Brush tool (
). 
4 In the options bar, select the following settings:
• Brush size: 7 px
• Mode: Normal
• Type: Content-Aware
5 With the Spot Healing Brush tool, brush out the hair across the face. Because 
you’ve selected Content-Aware in the options bar, the Spot Healing Brush tool 
replaces the hair with skin that is similar to that around it.
6 Paint over fine lines around the eyes and mouth. You can also brush away the 
red veins in the model’s eyes, and freckles and spots on her face. Experiment 
with simply clicking, using very short strokes, and creating longer brush strokes. 
Remove obtrusive or distracting lines and blemishes, but leave enough that the 
face retains its character.

144 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
Now you’ll use the Healing Brush tool to remove the darker makeup smudges 
under the model’s eyes.
7 Select the Healing Brush tool ( ), hidden under the Spot Healing Brush  
tool (
). Select a brush with a size of 19 pixels and a hardness of 50%.
8 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) an area just below the dark  
areas beneath her eyes to create the sampling source. 
9 Brush beneath her eyes to remove the dark makeup. You’re changing the color 
now. You’ll smooth out the texture later.
10 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
enhancing an image using the Dodge and sponge tools
You’ll use the Dodge tool to further lighten the color under the eyes so that it looks 
more natural. Then, you’ll use the Sponge tool to saturate the eyes.
1 With the Corrections layer still active, select the Dodge tool (
). 
2 In the options bar, change the brush size to 65 px and the Exposure to 30%. 
Make sure Midtones is selected in the Range menu.
3 Brush the Dodge tool over the shadows under the eyes to lighten them. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 145
4 Select the Sponge tool (
), hidden under the Dodge tool. In the options bar, 
make sure Vibrance is selected, and then select the following settings:
• Brush size: 35 px
• Brush hardness: 0%
• Mode: Saturate
• Flow: 50%
5 Move the Sponge tool over the irises in the eyes to increase their saturation.
6 Select the Dodge tool again, and select Shadows from the Range menu in the 
options bar.
7 Use the Dodge tool to lighten the shadow area above the eyes and the areas 
around the irises to bring out the color.

adjusting skin tones
In Photoshop CS6 you can select a color range that targets skin tones so that it’s 
easier to adjust the levels and color tone of skin without affecting the entire image. 
The skin tone color range selects other areas of the image with a similar color, but if 
you’re making slight adjustments, this is usually acceptable. 
1 Choose Select > Color Range.
2 In the Color Range dialog box, choose Skin Tones from the Select menu. 
The preview shows that much of the image has been selected.
3 Select Detect Faces.
The preview in the selection changes. Now, the face, hair highlights and lighter 
areas of the background are selected, as well as some creases in the sleeve.
4 Decrease the Fuzziness slider to 28. Then click OK.
The selection appears on the image itself as marching ants. You’ll apply a Curves 
adjustment layer to the selection to lighten those areas of the image.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 147
5 Click the Curves icon in the Adjustments panel. 
Photoshop adds a Curves adjustment layer above the Corrections layer.
6 Click in the middle of the graph, and pull the curve slightly up. The selected 
areas lighten. The adjustment affects more of the image than the skin tones, but 
the effect blends well and is subtle.

Pro photo workflow
Good habits make all the difference
A sensible workflow and good work habits will keep you enthused about digital photography, help 
your images shine—and save you from the night terrors of losing work you never backed up. Here’s 
an outline of the basic workflow for digital images from a professional photographer with more than 
25 years’ experience. To help you get the most from the images you shoot, Jay Graham offers guide-
lines for setting up your camera, creating a basic color workflow, selecting file formats, organizing 
images, and showing off your work. 
Graham uses Adobe Photoshop Lightroom® to organize thousands of images.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 149
“The biggest complaint from people is they’ve lost their image. Where  
is it? What does it look like?” says Graham. “So naming is important.”
Start out right by setting up your camera preferences 
If your camera has the option, it’s generally best to shoot in its camera raw file format, which captures 
all the image information you need. With one camera raw photo, says Graham, “You can go from day-
light to an indoor tungsten image without degradation” when it’s reproduced. If it makes more sense 
to shoot in JPEG for your project, use fine compression and high resolution.
Start with the best material 
Get all the data when you capture—at fine compression and high resolution. You can’t go back later. 
Organize your files 
Name and catalogue your images as soon after downloading them as possible. “If the camera names 
files, eventually it resets and produces multiple files with the same name,” says Graham. Use Adobe 
Photoshop Lightroom to rename, rank, and add metadata to the photos you plan to keep; cull those 
you don’t.
Graham names his files by date (and possibly subject). He would store a series of photos taken 
Dec. 12, 2011 at Stinson Beach in a folder named “20111212_Stinson_01”; within the folder, he names 
each image incrementally, and each image has a unique filename. “That way, it lines up on the hard 
drive real easily,” he says. Follow Windows naming conventions to keep filenames usable on non-
Macintosh platforms (32 characters maximum; only numbers, letters, underscores, and hyphens). 
Convert raw images to Adobe Camera Raw 
It may be best to convert all your camera raw images to the DNG format. Unlike many cameras’ pro-
prietary raw formats, this open-source format can be read by any device. 
Keep a master image 
Save your master in PSD, TIFF, or DNG format, not in JPEG. Each time a JPEG is re-edited and saved, 
compression is reapplied and the image quality degrades.
Show off to clients and friends 
When you prepare your work for delivery, choose the appropriate color file for the destination. 
Convert the image to that profile, rather than assigning the profile. sRGB is generally best for view-
ing electronically or for printing from most online printing services. Adobe 1998 or Colormatch are 
the best profiles to use for RGB images destined for traditionally printed material such as brochures. 
Adobe 1998 or ProPhoto RGB are best for printing with inkjet printers. Use 72 dpi for electronic view-
ing and 180 dpi or higher for printing.
Back up your images 
You’ve devoted a lot of time and effort to your images: don’t lose them. Because the lifespan of CDs 
and DVDs is uncertain, it’s best to back up to an external hard drive (or drives!), ideally set to back up 
automatically. “The question is not if your [internal] hard drive is going to crash,” says Graham, reciting 
a common adage. “It’s when.”

Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
applying surface blur
You’re almost done with the model. As a finishing touch, you’ll apply the Surface 
Blur filter to give her a smooth appearance.
1 Select the Corrections layer, and choose Layer > Duplicate Layer. Name the 
layer Surface Blur, and click OK in the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
2 Move the Surface Blur layer between the Curves 1 and Levels 1 layers in the  
Layers panel.
3 With the Surface Blur layer selected, choose Filter > Blur > Surface Blur. 
4 In the Surface Blur dialog box, leave the Radius at 5 pixels, and move the 
Threshold to 10 levels. Then click OK.
The Surface Blur filter has left the model looking a little glassy. You’ll reduce its 
effect by reducing its opacity.
5 With the Surface Blur layer selected, change the Opacity to 30% in the  
Layers panel. 
She looks more realistic now, but you can target the surface blur more precisely 
using the Eraser tool. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 151
6 Select the Eraser tool (
). In the options bar, select a midsized brush between  
10 and 50 pixels, with 10% hardness. Set the opacity to 90%.
7 Brush over the eyes, eyebrows, the defining lines 
of the nose, and the teeth. You’re erasing part of 
the blurred layer to let the sharper layer below 
show through in these areas. 
8 Zoom out so you can see the entire image.
9 Increase the brush size to 400 pixels, and then 
lightly sweep across the background, the shirt, 
and the hair to bring those areas back to their 
full sharpness. Now only the model’s face has 
the surface blur.
10 Save your work, and close the image.
Correcting digital photographs in Photoshop
As you’ve seen, Photoshop provides many features to help you easily improve 
the quality of digital photographs. These include the ability to bring out details 
in the shadow and highlight areas of an image, gracefully remove red eye, reduce 
unwanted noise, and sharpen targeted areas of an image. To explore these capabili-
ties, you will edit a different digital image now: a portrait of a girl on the beach.
adjusting shadows and highlights
To bring out the detail in dark or light areas of an image, you can use the Shadows/
Highlights command. Shadows/Highlights adjustments work best when the subject 
of the image is silhouetted against strong backlight-
ing or is washed out because the camera flash was 
too close. You can also use the adjustments to pull 
details from the shadows in an image that is other-
wise well-lit. 
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge. In the Favorites 
panel in Bridge, click the Lessons folder. In 
the Content panel, double-click the Lesson05 
folder. Then double-click the 05C_Start.psd 
image to open it in Photoshop.
2 Choose File > Save As. Name the file  
05C_Working.psd, and click Save.

152 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
3 Choose Image > Adjustments > Shadows/Highlights. Photoshop automatically 
applies default settings to the image, lightening the background. You’ll 
customize the settings to bring out more detail in both the shadows and the 
highlights, and to enhance the sunset.
4 In the Shadows/Highlights dialog box, select Show More Options to expand the 
dialog box. Then do the following:
•
In the Shadows area, set Amount to 50%, Tonal Width to 50%, and Radius  
to 38 px. 
•
In the Highlights area, set Amount to 14%, Tonal Width to 46%, and Radius 
to 43 px.
•
In the Adjustments area, drag the Color Correction slider to +5, set the 
Midtone Contrast slider to +22, and leave the Black Clip and White Clip 
settings at their defaults.
5 Click OK to accept your changes.
6 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.

Correcting red eye
Red eye occurs when the retina of a subject’s eye is reflected by the camera flash. 
It commonly occurs in photographs of a subject in a darkened room, because the 
subject’s irises are wide open. Red eye is easy to fix in Photoshop. In this exercise, 
you will remove the red eye from the girl’s eyes in the portrait.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and then drag a marquee around the girl’s eyes to 
zoom in to them. You may need to deselect Scrubby Zoom in the options bar to 
drag a marquee.
2 Select the Red Eye tool (
), hidden under the Healing Brush tool  ( ).
3 In the options bar, leave Pupil Size set to 50%, but change Darken Amount  
to 74%. The Darken Amount specifies how dark the pupil should be.
4 Click on the red area in the girl’s left eye. The red reflection disappears.
5 Click on the red area in the girl’s right eye to remove that reflection, as well.
6 Double-click the Zoom tool to zoom out to 100%.
7 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
reducing noise
Random, extraneous pixels that aren’t part of the image detail are called noise. 
Noise can result from using a high ISO setting on a digital camera, from underex-
posure, or from shooting in darkness with a long shutter speed. Scanned images 
may contain noise that results from the scanning sensor, or from a grain pattern 
from the scanned film. 
There are two types of image noise: luminance noise, which is grayscale data that 
makes an image look grainy or patchy; and color noise, which appears as colored 
artifacts in the image. The Reduce Noise filter can address both types of noise in 
individual color channels while preserving edge detail, and can also correct JPEG 
compression artifacts. 

154 
lesson 5 
Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
First, zoom in to the girl’s face to get a good look at the noise in this image.
1 Using the Zoom tool (
), click in the center of the face and zoom in to  
about 300%.
The noise in this image is speckled and rough, with uneven graininess in the skin. 
Using the Reduce Noise filter, you can smooth out this area.
2 Choose Filter > Noise > Reduce Noise.
3 In the Reduce Noise dialog box, do the following:
•
Increase Strength to 8. (Strength controls the amount of luminance noise.)
•
Decrease Preserve Details to 30%.
•
Increase Reduce Color Noise to 80%.
•
Move Sharpen Details to 30%. 
You don’t need to select Remove JPEG Artifact, because this image is not a JPEG 
and has no JPEG artifacts.
4 Drag to position the face in the preview area. Click and hold the mouse button 
down in the preview area to see the “before” image, and release the mouse 
button to see the corrected result.
 Note: To correct 
noise in individual 
channels of the image, 
select Advanced 
and click the Per 
Channel tab to adjust 
the settings in each 
channel.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 155
5 Click OK to apply your changes and to close the Reduce Noise dialog box, and 
then double-click the Zoom tool to return to 100%. 
6 Choose File > Save to save your work, and then close the file.
Correcting image distortion
The Lens Correction filter fixes common camera lens flaws, such as barrel and 
pincushion distortion, chromatic aberration, and vignetting. Barrel distortion is 
a lens defect that causes straight lines to bow out toward the edges of the image. 
Pincushion distortion is the opposite effect, causing straight lines to bend inward. 
Chromatic aberration appears as a color fringe along the edges of image objects. 
Vignetting occurs when the edges of an image, especially the corners, are darker 
than the center. 
Some lenses exhibit these defects depending on the focal length or the f-stop used. 
The Lens Correction filter can apply settings based on the camera, lens, and focal 
length that were used to make the image. The filter can also rotate an image or fix 
image perspective caused by tilting a camera vertically or horizontally. The filter’s 
image grid makes it easier and more accurate to make these adjustments than using 
the Transform command.
In this exercise, you will adjust the lens distortion 
in an image of a Greek temple. 
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge. In Bridge, 
navigate to the Lesson05 folder. Double-
click the 05D_Start.psd image to open it in 
Photoshop.
The columns in this image bend toward the camera 
and appear to be warped. This photo was shot at a 
range that was too close with a wide-angle lens. 
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog 
box, name the file Columns_Final.psd, and 
save it in the Lesson05 folder. Click OK if the 
Photoshop Format Options dialog box appears.
3 Choose Filter > Lens Correction. The Lens Correction dialog box opens. 

156

4 Select Show Grid at the bottom of the dialog box, if it’s not already selected. 
An alignment grid overlays the image, next to options for removing distortion, 
correcting chromatic aberration, removing vignettes, and transforming 
perspective.
The Lens Correction dialog box includes auto-correction options. You’ll adjust one 
setting in the Auto Correction tab and then customize the settings.
5 In the Correction area of the Auto Correction tab, make sure Auto Scale Image 
is selected, and that Transparency is selected from the Edge menu. 
6 Select the Custom tab. 
7 In the Custom tab, drag the Remove Distortion slider to about +52.00 to remove 
the barrel distortion in the image. Alternatively, you could select the Remove 
Distortion tool (
) and drag in the image preview area until the columns are 
straight.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 157
The adjustment causes the image borders to bow inward. However, because you 
selected Auto Scale Image, the Lens Correction filter automatically scales the image 
to adjust the borders.
8 Click OK to apply your changes and close the Lens Correction dialog box. 
The curving distortion caused by the wide-angle lens and low shooting angle are 
eliminated.
9 (Optional) To see the effect of your change 
in the main image window, press Ctrl+Z 
(Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) twice to 
undo and redo the filter.
10 Choose File > Save to save your changes, and 
then close the image.
E Tip: Watch the 
alignment grid as you 
make these changes so 
that you can see when 
the vertical columns  
are straightened in  
the image.

Correcting and enhancing digital Photographs
adding depth of field
When you’re shooting a photo, you often have to choose to focus either the back-
ground or the foreground. If you want the entire image to be in focus, take two 
photos—one with the background in focus and one with the foreground in focus—
and then merge the two in Photoshop.
Because you’ll need to align the images exactly, it’s helpful to use a tripod to keep 
the camera steady. Even with a handheld camera, though, you can get some amaz-
ing results. You’ll add depth of field to an image of a wine glass in front of a beach.
1 In Photoshop, choose File > Open. Navigate to the Lessons/Lesson05 folder, and 
double-click the 05E_Start.psd file to open it.
2 Choose File > Save As. Name the file Glass_Final.psd, and save it in the 
Lesson05 folder. Click OK if the Photoshop Format Options dialog box appears. 
3 In the Layers panel, hide the Beach layer, so that only the Glass layer is visible. 
The glass is in focus, but the background is blurred. Then, show the Beach layer 
and hide the Glass layer. Now the beach is in focus, but the glass is blurred.
You’ll merge the layers, using the part of each layer that is in focus. First, you need 
to align the layers.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 159
4 Show both layers again, and then Shift-click to select both of them. 
5 Choose Edit > Auto-Align Layers. 
Because these images were shot from the same angle, Auto will work just fine.
6 Select Auto, if it isn’t already selected. Make sure neither Vignette Removal nor 
Geometric Distortion is selected. Then click OK to align the layers.
Now that the layers are perfectly aligned, you’re ready to blend them.
7 Make sure both layers are still selected in the Layers panel. Then choose Edit > 
Auto-Blend Layers.
8 Select Stack Images and Seamless Tones And Colors, and then click OK.

extending objects with the Content-aware Move tool
You’ll use the new Content-Aware Move tool to add a few more posts to the beach, 
so that they echo the deck rails, creating a smoother rhythm for the composition. 
1 Select the Content-Aware Move tool (
), which is hidden beneath the Red Eye 
Removal tool (
).
2 In the options bar, choose Extend from the Mode menu and Strict from the 
Adaptation menu.
3 Draw a marquee around the two pier posts on the end of the row, including 
some of the sand where their shadows fall. 
4 Drag the selection slightly down and to the right of the original posts to 
continue the row. 
When you release the mouse, Photoshop adds two new posts and blends them in 
with the scene neatly.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.

adding interactive blur
Photoshop CS6 introduces interactive blurs, which let you customize the blur  
as you preview it on your image. You’ll apply an iris blur to add a vignette around 
the glass.
1 Choose Filter > Blur > Iris Blur.
A blur ellipse is centered on your image. You can adjust the location and scope of 
the blur by moving the center pin, feather handles, and ellipse handles. Photoshop 
also opens the Blur Tools and Blur Effects panels.
2 Drag the center pin so that it’s on the right side of the wine glass. 
3 Click the ellipse and drag to enlarge the scope of the blur. 
4 Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you click and drag the feather 
handles to match those in the second image below.

high dynamic range (hDr) images
When you look at the world, your eyes adapt to different brightness levels so that you can see the 
detail in shadows or highlights. Cameras and computer monitors, however, are more limited in the 
dynamic range (the ratio between dark and bright regions) they can reproduce. The ability to create 
high dynamic range (HDR) images in Photoshop lets you bring the brightness you can see in the real 
world into your images. HDR images are used mostly in movies, special effects, and other high-end 
photography. However, you can create an HDR image using multiple photographs, each captured  
at a different exposure, to bring the detail revealed in each shot into a single image.  
You’ll use the Merge To HDR Pro filter to combine three photos of a streetscape. 
1
In Bridge, open the Lesson05/HDR_ExtraCredit folder, and view the StreetA.jpg, StreetB.jpg, and 
StreetC.jpg files. These images are of the same scene, shot at different exposures. Though we’re 
using JPEG images, you could use raw images, too.
2
In Photoshop, choose File > Automate > Merge To HDR Pro. 
3
In the Merge To HDR Pro dialog box, click Browse. Then navigate to the Lesson05/HDR_
ExtraCredit folder, and Shift-select the StreetA.jpg, StreetB.jpg, and StreetC.jpg files. Click  
OK or Open.
4
Make sure Attempt To Automatically Align Source Images is selected, and then click OK.
Photoshop opens each of the files briefly and merges them into a single image. That image appears 
in the Merge To HDR Pro dialog box, with default settings applied. The three images you merged are 
shown in the lower left corner of the dialog box.

review questions
1 What happens to camera raw images when you edit them in Camera Raw?
2 What is the advantage of the Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) file format?
3 How do you correct red eye in Photoshop?
4 Describe how to fix common camera lens flaws in Photoshop. What causes 
these defects?
review answers
1 A camera raw file contains unprocessed picture data from a digital camera’s image 
sensor. Camera raw files give photographers control over interpreting the image data, 
rather than letting the camera make the adjustments and conversions. When you edit 
the image in Camera Raw, it preserves the original raw file data. This way, you can edit 
the image as you desire, export it, and keep the original intact for future use or other 
adjustments.
2 The Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) file format contains the raw image data from a 
digital camera as well as metadata that defines what the image data means. DNG is an 
industry-wide standard for camera raw image data that helps photographers manage 
proprietary camera raw file formats and provides a compatible archival format.
3 Red eye occurs when the retinas of a subject’s eyes are reflected by the camera flash.  
To correct red eye in Adobe Photoshop, zoom in to the subject’s eyes, select the Red 
Eye tool, and then click the red eyes.
4 The Lens Correction filter fixes common camera lens flaws, such as barrel and 
pincushion distortion, in which straight lines bow out towards the edges of the image 
(barrel) or bend inward (pincushion); chromatic aberration, where a color fringe 
appears along the edges of image objects; and vignetting at the edges of an image, 
especially corners, that are darker than the center. Defects can occur from incorrectly 
setting the lens’s focal length or f-stop, or by tilting the camera vertically  
or horizontally.

Use masks to isolate and manipulate specific parts 
of an image. The cutout portion of a mask can be 
altered, but the area surrounding the cutout is pro-
tected from change. You can create a temporary mask 
to use once, or you can save masks for repeated use.

masks and Channels
Working with masks and channels
Photoshop masks isolate and protect parts of an image, just as masking tape pro-
tects window panes or trim from paint when a house is painted. When you create 
a mask based on a selection, the area you haven’t selected is masked, or protected 
from editing. With masks, you can create and save time-consuming selections and 
then use them again. In addition, you can use masks for other complex editing 
tasks—for example, to apply color changes or filter effects to an image.
In Photoshop, you can make temporary masks, called quick masks, or you can 
create permanent masks and store them as special grayscale channels called alpha 
channels. Photoshop also uses channels to store an image’s color information. 
Unlike layers, channels do not print. You use the Channels panel to view and work 
with alpha channels.
A key concept in masking is that black hides and white reveals. As in life, rarely 
is anything black and white. Shades of gray partially hide, depending on the gray 
levels (255 is the value for black, hiding artwork completely; 0 is the value for white, 
revealing artwork completely). 
Getting started
First, you’ll view the image that you’ll create using masks and channels. 
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 Click the Favorites tab on the left side of the Bridge window. Select the Lessons 
folder, and then double-click the Lesson06 folder in the Content panel. 
5 Study the 06End.psd file. To enlarge the thumbnail so that you can see it  
more clearly, move the thumbnail slider at the bottom of the Bridge window  
to the right.
In this lesson, you’ll create a magazine cover. The model for the cover was photo-
graphed in front of a different background. You’ll use masking and the Refine Mask 
feature to place the model on the appropriate background. 
6 Double-click the 06Start.psd file’s thumbnail to open it in Photoshop. Click OK 
if you see an Embedded Profile Mismatch dialog box.

Creating a mask
You’ll use the Quick Selection tool to create the initial mask in order to separate  
the model from the background.
1 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 06Working.psd, and click Save. Click OK 
if the Photoshop Format Options dialog box appears.
Saving a working version of the file lets you return to the original if you need it.
2 Select the Quick Selection tool (
). In the options bar, set up a brush with a size 
of 15 px and hardness of 100%.
3 Select the man. It’s fairly easy to select his shirt and face, but the hair is  
trickier. Don’t worry if the selection isn’t perfect. You’ll refine the mask in  
the next exercise.
4 At the bottom of the Layers panel, click the Add Layer Mask button ( )  
to create a layer mask. 
E Tip: For help 
making selections, refer 
to Lesson 3, "Working 
with Selections."

The selection becomes a pixel mask, and it appears as part of Layer 0 in the Layers  
panel. Everything outside the selection is transparent, represented by a checker-
board pattern.

Zoom tool shortcuts
Often when you are editing an image, you’ll need to zoom in to work on a detail 
and then zoom out again to see the changes in context. Here are several keyboard 
shortcuts that make zooming even faster and easier.
•
Press Ctrl+spacebar (Windows) or Command+spacebar (Mac OS) to temporarily 
select the Zoom In tool. When you finish zooming, release the keys to return to 
the tool you were previously using.
•
Press Alt+spacebar (Windows) or Option+spacebar (Mac OS) to temporarily 
select the Zoom Out tool. When you finish zooming, release the keys to return 
to the tool you were using.
•
Double-click the Zoom tool in the Tools panel to return the image to 100% view.
•
When Scrubby Zoom is selected in the options bar, just drag the Zoom tool to 
the left to zoom in or drag it to the right to zoom out.
•
Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) to change the Zoom In tool to the Zoom 
Out tool, and click the area of the image you want to reduce. Each Alt/Option-
click reduces the image by the next preset increment.
•
With any tool selected, press Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) with the 
plus sign (+) to zoom in, or with the minus sign (-) to zoom out.
refining a mask
The mask is pretty good, but the Quick Selection tool couldn’t quite capture all of 
the model’s hair. The mask is also a little choppy around the contours of the shirt 
and face. You’ll smooth the mask, and then fine-tune the area around the hair.
1 Choose Window > Properties to open the Properties panel. 
2 If it isn’t already selected, click the mask on Layer 0 in the Layers panel. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 171
3 In the Properties panel, click Mask Edge. The Refine Mask dialog box opens.
4 In the View Mode area of the dialog box, click the arrow next to the preview 
window. Choose On Black from the pop-up menu. 
The mask appears against a black background, which makes it easier to see the  
edge of the white shirt and the face. 
5 In the Adjust Edge area of the dialog box, move the sliders to create a smooth, 
unfeathered edge along the shirt and face. The optimal settings depend on the 
selection you created, but they’ll probably be similar to ours. We moved the 
Smooth slider to 15, Contrast to 40%, and Shift Edge to -8%.

6 In the Output area of the dialog box, select Decontaminate Colors. Choose New 
Layer With Layer Mask from the Output To menu. 
7 Select the Zoom tool in the Refine Mask dialog box, and then click the face to 
zoom in so you can see its edges more clearly.
8 Select the Refine Radius tool (
) in the Refine Mask dialog box. Use it to paint 
out any white background that remains around the lips and the nose. Press the 
left bracket ([) to decrease the brush size and the right bracket (]) to increase it.
9 When you’re satisfied with the mask around the face, click OK. 
A new layer, named Layer 0 copy, appears in the Layers panel. You’ll use this layer 
to add the spikes to the mask of the hair. 
10 With Layer 0 copy active, click Mask Edge in the Properties panel to open the 
Refine Mask dialog box again.
11 From the View pop-up menu, choose On White. The black hair shows up 
well against the white matte. If necessary, zoom out or use the Hand tool to 
reposition the image so that you can see all of the hair. 
12 Select the Refine Radius tool in the Refine Mask dialog box. Press the ] key to 
increase the size of the brush. (The options bar displays the brush size; we used 
300 px at first.) Then, begin brushing along the top of the hair, high enough to 
include the spikes. Press the [ key to decrease the brush size by about half. Then, 
paint along the right side of the head, where the hair is a solid color, to pick up 
any small, fine hairs that protrude. 
As you paint, Photoshop refines the mask edge, including the hair, but eliminat-
ing most of the background. If you were painting on a layer mask, the background 
would be included. The Refine Mask feature is good, but it’s not perfect. You’ll 
clean up any areas of background that are included with the hair.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 173
13 Select the Erase Refinements tool (
), hidden behind the Refine Radius tool in 
the Refine Mask dialog box. Click once or twice in each area where background 
color shows. When you erase an area, the Refine Mask feature erases similar 
colors, cleaning up more of the mask for you. Be careful not to erase the 
refinements you made to the hair edge. You can undo a step or use the Refine 
Radius tool to restore the edge if necessary.
14 Select Decontaminate Colors, and move the Amount slider to 85%. Choose  
New Layer With Layer Mask from the Output menu. Then click OK.
15 In the Layers panel, make the Magazine Background layer visible. The model 
appears in front of an orange patterned background.

Masking tips and shortcuts
Mastering masks can help you work more efficiently in Photoshop. These tips  
will help get you started.
•
Masks are nondestructive, which means that you can edit the masks later 
without losing the pixels that they hide.
•
When editing a mask, be aware of the color selected in the Tools panel. Black 
hides, white reveals, and shades of gray partially hide or reveal. The darker the 
gray, the more is hidden by the mask. 
•
To reveal a layer’s content without masking effects, turn off the mask by Shift-
clicking the layer mask thumbnail, or choose Layer > Layer Mask > Disable. A 
red X appears over the mask thumbnail in the Layers panel when the mask is 
disabled. 
•
To turn a layer mask back on, Shift-click the layer mask thumbnail with the  
red X in the Layers panel, or choose Layer > Layer Mask > Enable. If the mask  
doesn’t show up in the Layers panel, choose Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All  
to display it. 
•
Unlink a layer from its mask to move the two independently and shift the mask’s 
boundaries separately from the layer. To unlink a layer or group from its layer 
mask or vector mask, click the link icon between the thumbnails in the Layers 
panel. To relink them, click the blank space between the two thumbnails.
•
To convert a vector mask to a layer mask, select the layer containing the vector 
mask you want to convert, and choose Layer > Rasterize > Vector Mask. Note, 
however, that once you rasterize a vector mask, you can’t change it back into a 
vector object.
•
To modify a mask, use the Density and Feather sliders in the Properties panel. 
The Density slider determines the opacity of the mask: At 100%, the mask is fully 
in effect; at lower opacities, the contrast lessens; and at 0%, the mask has no 
effect. The Feather slider softens the edge of the mask. 
Creating a quick mask
You’ll create a quick mask to change the color of the glasses frames. First, you’ll 
clean up the Layers panel.
1 Hide the Magazine Background layer so you can focus on the model. Then 
delete the Layer 0 and Layer 0 copy layers. Click Yes or Delete to confirm 
deletion of the layers or their masks, if prompted; you do not need to apply the 
mask to the current layer because Layer 0 copy 2 already has the mask applied.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 175
2 Double-click the Layer 0 copy 2 layer name, and rename it Model.
3 Click the Edit In Quick Mask Mode button in the Tools panel. (By default, you 
have been working in Standard mode.) 
In Quick Mask mode, a red overlay appears as you make a selection, masking the 
area outside the selection the way a rubylith, or red acetate, was used to mask 
images in traditional print shops. You can apply changes only to the unprotected 
area that is visible and selected. Notice that the highlight for the selected layer in 
the Layers panel appears gray instead of blue, indicating you’re in Quick Mask 
 inmode. 
4 In the Tools panel, select the Brush tool (
). 
5 In the options bar, make sure that the mode is Normal. Open the Brush pop-up 
panel, and select a small brush with a diameter of 13 px. Click outside the panel 
to close it. 
6 Paint the earpiece of the glasses frames. The area you paint will appear red, 
creating a mask. 
7 Continue painting with the Brush tool to mask the earpiece of the frames and 
the frame around the lenses. Reduce the brush size to paint around the lenses. 
Don’t worry about the part of the earpiece that is overlapped by hair; the color 
change won’t affect that area. 

176 
lesson 6 
masks and Channels
In Quick Mask mode, Photoshop automatically defaults to Grayscale mode, with a 
foreground color of black, and a background color of white. When using a painting 
or editing tool in Quick Mask mode, keep these principles in mind:
• Painting with black adds to the mask (the red overlay) and decreases the 
selected area.
• Painting with white erases the mask (the red overlay) and increases the 
selected area.
• Painting with gray partially adds to the mask . 
8 Click the Edit In Standard Mode button to exit Quick Mask Mode. 
The unmasked area is selected. Unless you save a quick mask as a more permanent 
alpha-channel mask, Photoshop discards the temporary mask once it is converted 
to a selection.
9 Choose Select > Inverse to select the area you originally masked.
10 Choose Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation.
11 In the Hue/Saturation dialog box, change the Hue to 70. The new green color 
fills the glasses frame. Click OK.
12 Choose Select > Deselect.
13 Save your work so far.

Manipulating an image with Puppet Warp
The Puppet Warp feature gives you flexibility in manipulating an image. You can 
reposition areas, such as hair or an arm, just as you might pull the strings on a pup-
pet. You place pins where you want to control movement. You’ll use Puppet Warp 
to tilt the model’s head back, so he appears to be looking up.
1 With the Model layer selected in the Layers 
panel, choose Edit > Puppet Warp.
A mesh appears over the visible areas in the 
layer—in this case, the mesh appears over the 
model. You’ll use the mesh to place pins where 
you want to control movement (or to ensure there 
is no movement).
2 Click around the edges of the shirt. Each 
time you click, Puppet Warp adds a pin. 
Approximately 10 pins should work.
The pins you’ve added around the shirt will keep it in place as you tilt the head.
3 Select the pin at the nape of the neck. A 
white dot appears in the center of the 
pin to indicate that it’s selected.

178 
lesson 6 
masks and Channels
4 Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS). A larger circle appears around the 
pin and a curved double arrow appears next to it. Continue pressing Alt or 
Option as you drag the pointer to rotate the head backwards. You can see the 
angle of rotation in the options bar; you can enter 135 there to rotate the head 
back. 
5 When you’re satisfied with the rotation, click the Commit Puppet Warp  
button ( ) in the options bar, or press Enter or Return. 
6 Save your work so far.
Working with channels
Just as different information in an image is stored on different layers, channels also 
let you access specific kinds of information. Alpha channels store selections as gray-
scale images. Color information channels store information about each color in  
an image; for example, an RGB image automatically has red, green, blue, and  
composite channels.  
To avoid confusing channels and layers, think of channels as containing an image’s 
color and selection information; think of layers as containing painting and effects. 
You’ll use an alpha channel to create a shadow for the model. Then, you’ll convert 
the image to CMYK mode and use the Black channel to add color highlights to  
the hair.
using an alpha channel to create a shadow
You’ve already created a mask of the model. To create a shadow, you want to essen-
tially duplicate that mask and then shift it. You’ll use an alpha channel to make that 
possible.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 179
1 In the Layers panel, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the layer 
icon in the Model layer. The masked area is selected.
2 Choose Select > Save Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box, make sure New 
is chosen in the Channel menu. Then name the channel Model Outline, and 
click OK.
Nothing changes in the Layers panel or in the image window. However, a new 
channel named Model Outline has been added to the Channels panel. 
3 Click the Create A New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. Drag  
the new layer below the Model layer. Then double-click its name, and rename  
it Shadow.
4 With the Shadow layer selected, choose Select > Refine Edge. In the Refine Edge 
dialog box, move the Shift Edge slider to +36%. Then click OK.
5 Choose Edit > Fill. In the Fill dialog box, choose Black from the Use menu, and 
then click OK.
The Shadow layer displays a filled-in black outline of the model. Shadows aren’t 
usually as dark as the person that casts them. You’ll reduce the layer opacity.
6 In the Layers panel, change the layer opacity to 30%.

180 
lesson 6 
masks and Channels
The shadow is in exactly the same position as the model, where it can’t be seen. 
You’ll shift it.
7 Choose Select > Deselect to remove the selection.
8 Choose Edit > Transform > Skew. Rotate the 
shadow by hand, or enter -15° in the Rotate 
field in the options bar. Then drag the shadow 
to the left, or enter 845 in the X field in the 
options bar. Click the Commit Transform 
button ( ) in the options bar, or press Enter or 
Return, to accept the transformation.

about alpha channels
If you work in Photoshop very long, you’re bound to work with alpha channels.  
It’s a good idea to know a few things about them.
•
An image can contain up to 56 channels, including all color and alpha channels.
•
All channels are 8-bit grayscale images, capable of displaying 256 levels of gray.
•
You can specify a name, color, mask option, and opacity for each channel. (The 
opacity affects the preview of the channel, not the image.)
•
All new channels have the same dimensions and number of pixels as the  
original image.
•
You can edit the mask in an alpha channel using the painting tools, editing 
tools, and filters.
•
You can convert alpha channels to spot-color channels.
adjusting an individual channel
You’re almost done with the magazine cover image. All that remains is to add color 
highlights to the model’s hair. You’ll convert the image to CMYK mode so you can 
take advantage of the Black channel to do just that.
1 Select the Model layer in the Layers panel. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 181
2 Choose Image > Mode > CMYK Color. Click Don’t Merge in the dialog box 
that appears, because you want to keep your layers intact. Click OK if you’re 
prompted about color profiles.
3 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the visibility icon for the Model 
layer to hide the other layers.
4 Select the Channels tab. In the Channels panel, select the Black channel. Then 
choose Duplicate Channel from the Channels panel menu. Name the channel 
Hair, and click OK.
Individual channels appear in grayscale. If more than one channel is visible in the 
Channels panel, the channels appear in color.
5 Make the Hair channel visible, and hide the Black channel. Then select the Hair 
channel, and choose Image > Adjustments > Levels.

182

6 In the Levels dialog box, adjust the levels to move Black to 85, Midtones to 1, 
and White to 165. Click OK.
7 With the Hair channel still selected, choose Image > Adjustments > Invert. The 
channel appears white against a black background.
8 Select the Brush tool, and click the Switch Foreground And Background Colors 
icon in the Tools panel to make the Foreground color black. Then paint over the 
glasses, eyes, and anything in the channel that isn’t hair.
9 Click the Load Channel As Selection icon at the bottom of the Channels panel. 
10 Select the Layers tab. In the Layers panel, select the Model layer. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 183
11 Choose Select > Refine Edge. In the Refine Edge dialog box, move the Feather 
slider to 1.2 px, and then click OK.
12 Choose Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation. Select Colorize, and then move 
the sliders as follows, and click OK:
•
Hue: 230
•
Saturation: 56
•
Lightness: 11
13 Choose Image > Adjustments > Levels. In the Levels dialog box, move the sliders 
so that the Black slider is positioned where the blacks peak, the White slider 
where the whites peak, and the Midtones in between. Then click OK.  
We used the values 58, 1.65, 255, but your values may vary.

about masks and masking
Alpha channels, channel masks, clipping masks, layer masks, vector masks— 
what’s the difference? In some cases, they’re interchangeable: A channel mask can 
be converted to a layer mask, a layer mask can be converted to a vector mask, and 
vice versa.
Here’s a brief description to help you keep them all straight. What they have in  
common is that they all store selections, and they all let you edit an image  
nondestructively, so you can return at any time to your original.
•
An alpha channel—also called a mask or selection—is an extra channel 
added to an image; it stores selections as grayscale images. You can add alpha 
channels to create and store masks.
•
A layer mask is like an alpha channel, but it’s attached to a specific layer. A layer 
mask controls which part of a layer is revealed or hidden. It appears as a blank 
thumbnail next to the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel until you add content 
to it; a black outline indicates that it’s selected.
•
A vector mask is essentially a layer mask made up of vectors, not pixels. 
Resolution-independent, vector masks have crisp edges and are created with 
the pen or shape tools. They don’t support transparency, so their edges can’t be 
feathered. Their thumbnails appear the same as layer mask thumbnails. 
•
A clipping mask applies to a layer. It confines the influence of an effect to 
specific layers, rather than to everything below the layer in the layer stack. 
Using a clipping mask clips layers to a base layer; only that base layer is affected. 
Thumbnails of a clipped layer are indented with a right-angle arrow pointing to 
the layer below. The name of the clipped base layer is underlined.
•
A channel mask restricts editing to a specific channel (for example, a Cyan 
channel in a CMYK image). Channel masks are useful for making intricate, 
fringed, or wispy-edged selections. You can create a channel mask based on a 
dominant color in an image or a pronounced contrast in an isolated channel, for 
example, between the subject and the background.

review answers
1 Quick masks are helpful for creating quick, one-time selections. In addition, using a 
quick mask is an easy way to edit a selection using the painting tools.
2 The quick mask disappears when you deselect it.
3 Masks are saved in channels, which can be thought of as storage areas for color and 
selection information in an image.
4 You can paint on a mask in a channel using black, white, and shades of gray. 
5 Channels are used as storage areas for saved selections. Unless you explicitly display a 
channel, it does not appear in the image or print. Layers can be used to isolate various 
parts of an image so that they can be edited as discrete objects with the painting or 
editing tools or other effects.

lesson 7 typographic design
about type
Type in Photoshop consists of mathematically defined shapes that describe the let-
ters, numbers, and symbols of a typeface. Many typefaces are available in more than 
one format, the most common formats being Type 1 or PostScript fonts, TrueType, 
and OpenType (see “OpenType in Photoshop” later in this lesson).
When you add type to an image in Photoshop, the characters are composed of  
pixels and have the same resolution as the image file—zooming in on characters 
shows jagged edges. However, Photoshop preserves the vector-based type outlines 
and uses them when you scale or resize type, save a PDF or EPS file, or print the 
image to a PostScript printer. As a result, you can produce type with crisp, reso-
lution-independent edges, apply effects and styles to type, and transform its shape 
and size.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll work on the layout for the cover of a technology magazine. 
You’ll start with the artwork you created in Lesson 6: The cover has a model, his 
shadow, and the orange background. You’ll add and stylize type for the cover, 
including warping the text.
You’ll start the lesson by viewing an image of the final composition.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 In the Favorites panel on the left side of Bridge, click the Lessons folder, and 
then double-click the Lesson07 folder in the Content panel.
5 Select the 07End.psd file. Increase the thumbnail size to see the image clearly  
by dragging the thumbnail slider to the right.
You’ll apply the type treatment in Photoshop to finish the magazine cover. All of 
the type controls you need are available in Photoshop, so you don’t have to switch 
to another application to complete the project.
 Note: Though this 
lesson starts where 
Lesson 6 left off, use the 
07Start.psd file. We’ve 
included a path and a 
sticky note in the start 
file that won’t be in 
the 06Working.psd file 
you saved.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 189
6 Double-click the 07Start.psd file to open  
it in Photoshop.
7 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 
07Working.psd, and click Save. 
8 Click OK if the Photoshop Format Options 
dialog box appears.
9 Choose Typography from the Workspace 
Switcher in the options bar. 
The Typography workspace displays the Character, 
Paragraph, Paragraph Styles, Layers, and Paths 
panels that you’ll use in this lesson.
Creating a clipping mask from type
A clipping mask is an object or a group of objects whose shape masks other artwork 
so that only areas that lie within the clipping mask are visible. In effect, you are 
clipping the artwork to conform to the shape of the object (or mask). In Photoshop, 
you can create a clipping mask from shapes or letters. In this exercise, you’ll use 
letters as a clipping mask to allow an image in another layer to show through 
the letters.
adding guides to position type
The 07Working.psd file includes a background layer, which will be the foundation 
for your typography. You’ll start by zooming in on the work area and using ruler 
guides to help position the type.
1 Choose View > Fit On Screen to see 
the whole cover clearly.
2 Choose View > Rulers to display 
rulers along the left and top borders 
of the image window. 
3 Drag a vertical guide from the left 
ruler to the center of the cover (4.25").

lesson 7 typographic design
adding point type
Now you’re ready to add type to the composition. Photoshop lets you create hori-
zontal or vertical type anywhere in an image. You can enter point type (a single  
letter, word, or line) or paragraph type. You will do both in this lesson. First, you’ll  
create point type.
1 In the Layers panel, select the Background layer.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ), and, in the options bar, do the following:
• Choose a sans serif typeface, such as Myriad Pro, from the Font Family 
pop-up menu, and choose Semibold from the Font Style pop-up menu.
• Type 144 pt for the Size, and press Enter or Return.
• Click the Center Text button.
3 In the Character panel, change the Tracking value to 100.
4 Click on the center guide you added to set an insertion point, and type 
DIGITAL in all capital letters. Then click the Commit Any Current Edits button 
( ) in the options bar. 
The word “DIGITAL” is added to the cover, and it appears in the Layers panel as 
a new type layer, DIGITAL. You can edit and manage the type layer as you would 
any other layer. You can add or change the text, change the orientation of the type, 
apply anti-aliasing, apply layer styles and transformations, and create masks. You 
can move, restack, and copy a type layer, or edit its layer options, just as you would 
for any other layer.

Making a clipping mask and applying a shadow
You added the letters in black, the default text color. However, you want the letters 
to appear to be filled with an image of a circuit board, so you’ll use the letters to 
make a clipping mask that will allow another image layer to show through. 
1 Open the circuit_board.tif file, which is in the Lesson07 folder. You can open  
it using Bridge or by choosing File > Open.
2 In Photoshop, choose Window > Arrange > 2-Up Vertical. The circuit_board.tif 
and 07Working.psd files appear onscreen together. Click the circuit_board.tif 
file to ensure that it’s the active window. 
3 Select the Move tool. Then, hold down the Shift key as you drag the Background 
layer from the Layers panel in the circuit_board.tif file onto the center of the 
07Working.psd file. Pressing Shift as you drag centers the circuit_board.tif image 
in the composition.
A new layer—Layer 1— appears in the Layers panel for the 07Working.psd file. This 
new layer contains the image of the circuit board, which will show through the type. 
But before you make the clipping mask, you’ll resize the circuit board image, as it’s 
currently too large for the composition.
4 Close the circuit_board.tif file without saving any changes to it.
5 In the 07Working.psd file, select Layer 1, and then choose Edit > Transform > Scale. 
6 Grab a corner handle on the bounding box for the circuit board. Press Shift as 
you resize it to approximately the same width as the area of text. Pressing Shift 
retains the image proportions. Reposition the circuit board so that the image 
covers the text. 

192

7 Press Enter or Return to apply the transformation.
8 Double-click the Layer 1 name, and change it to Circuit Board. Then press 
Enter or Return, or click away from the name in the Layers panel, to apply  
the change.
9 Select the Circuit Board layer, if it isn’t already selected, and choose Create 
Clipping Mask from the Layers panel menu (
). 
The circuit board now shows through the DIGITAL letters. A small arrow in the 
Circuit Board layer and the underlined type layer name indicate the clipping mask 
is applied. Next, you’ll add an inner shadow to give the letters depth. 
10 Select the DIGITAL layer to make it active, click the Add A Layer Style button  
( ) at the bottom of the Layers panel, and then choose Inner Shadow from the 
pop-up menu. 
E Tip: You can also 
make a clipping mask 
by holding down 
the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key 
and clicking between 
the Circuit Board and 
DIGITAL type layers.

lesson 7 typographic design
Creating type on a path
In Photoshop, you can create type that follows along a path you create with a  
pen or shape tool. The direction the type flows depends on the order in which 
anchor points were added to the path. When you use the Horizontal Type tool  
to add text to a path, the letters are perpendicular to the baseline of the path.  
If you change the location or shape of the path, the type moves with it.
You’ll create type on a path to make it look as if questions are coming from the 
model’s mouth. We’ve already created the path for you.
1 In the Layers panel, select the Background layer.
2 Select the Paths tab in the Layers panel group. 
3 In the Paths panel, select the path named Speech Path. The path appears  
to be coming out of the model’s mouth.
4 Select the Horizontal Type tool.
5 In the Character panel, select the following  
settings:
•
Font Family: Myriad Pro
•
Font Style: Regular
•
Font Size (
): 16 pt
• Tracking (
): -10
• Color: White
• All Caps (
)
6 Move the Type tool over the path. When a small slanted line appears across  
the I-bar, click the beginning of the path, and type What’s new with Games?

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 195
7 Select the word “GAMES,” and change its font style to Bold. Click the Commit 
Any Current Edits button ( ) in the options bar.
8 In the Layers panel, select the What’s New with Games layer, and then choose 
Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel menu. Name the new layer What’s new 
with MP3s?
9 With the Type tool, select “Games,” and replace it with MP3s. Click the Commit 
Any Current Edits button in the options bar.
10 Choose Edit > Free Transform. Rotate the left side of the path approximately 
30 degrees, and then shift the path up above the first path. Click the Commit 
Transform button in the options bar.

196 
lesson 7 typographic design
11 Repeat steps 8–10, replacing the word “GAMES” with PHONES. Rotate the left 
side of the path approximately -30 degrees, and move it below the original path.
12 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Warping point type
The text on a path is more interesting than straight lines would be, but you’ll warp 
the text to make it more playful. Warping lets you distort type to conform to a vari-
ety of shapes, such as an arc or a wave. The warp style you select is an attribute of 
the type layer—you can change a layer’s warp style at any time to change the overall 
shape of the warp. Warping options give you precise control over the orientation 
and perspective of the warp effect.
1 Scroll or use the Hand tool ( ) to move the visible area of the image window  
so that the sentences to the left of the model are in the center of the screen. 
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the What’s new with Games? 
layer in the Layers panel, and choose Warp Text from the context menu.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 197
3 In the Warp Text dialog box, choose Wave from the Style menu, and select 
the Horizontal option. Specify the following values: Bend, +33%; Horizontal 
Distortion, -23%; and Vertical Distortion, +5%. Then click OK.
The words “What’s new with games?” appear to float like a wave on the cover. 
Repeat steps 2 and 3 to warp the other two text layers you typed on a path.
4 Save your work.
Designing paragraphs of type
All of the text you’ve written on this cover so far has been a few discrete words or 
lines—point type. However, many designs call for full paragraphs of text. You can 
design complete paragraphs of type in Photoshop; you can even apply paragraph 
styles. You don’t have to switch to a dedicated page layout program for sophisticated 
paragraph type controls. 
using guides for positioning
You will add paragraphs to the cover in Photoshop. First, you’ll add some guides to 
the work area to help you position the paragraph, and create a new paragraph style.
1 Drag a guide from the left vertical 
ruler, placing it approximately 1/4" 
from the right side of the cover.
2 Drag a guide down from the 
top horizontal ruler, placing it 
approximately 2" from the top of the 
cover.

198 
lesson 7 typographic design
adding paragraph type from a sticky note
You’re ready to add the text. In a real design environment, the text might be 
provided to you in a word-processing document or the body of an email message, 
which you could copy and paste into Photoshop. Or you might have to type it in. 
Another easy way to add a bit of text is for the copywriter to attach it to the image 
file in a sticky note, as we’ve done for you here.
1 Double-click the yellow sticky note in the lower right corner of the image 
window to open the Notes panel. Expand the Notes panel, if necessary,  
to see all the text. 
2 In the Notes panel, select all the text. Press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C 
(Mac OS) to copy the text to the clipboard. Close the Notes panel. 
3 Select the Model layer. Then, with the Horizontal Type tool ( ), drag a text box 
on the right side of the magazine cover. The text box should be about 4 inches by 
8 inches, about 1/4” from the right edge of the cover. Align the top and right edges 
using the guides you just added.
4 Press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the text. The  
new text layer is at the top of the Layers panel, so the text appears in front of  
the model. 
The pasted text is huge, because your default is set to 144 pt text. You’ll change  
it all to a readable size before stylizing it.
5 Click in the pasted text, and press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS) 
to select all the text. Then change its size to 18 pt in the Character panel.
E Tip: If you 
accidentally select the 
“DIGITAL” text, press 
Shift as you start to drag 
the text box, and then 
release it to continue 
to drag.  Pressing Shift 
ensures that Photoshop 
creates a new text layer. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 199
6 Select the first three lines (“The Trend Issue”), and then apply the following 
settings in the Character panel:
• Font Family: Myriad Pro (or another sans serif font)
• Font Style: Regular
• Font Size (
): 70 pt
• Leading ( ): 55 pt
• Color: White
7 Click the Paragraph tab in the Character panel group to make the Paragraph 
panel active.
8 With “The Trend Issue” still selected, click the Right Align Text option.
9 Click the Character tab to open the Character panel again. Then select just the 
word “Trend,” and change the Font Style to Bold. 
10 Click the Commit Any Current Edits button ( ) in the options bar.
11 Click in the blank area of the Layers panel to ensure that no layers are selected.
You’ve formatted the title. 
Creating paragraph styles
You’ll create a paragraph style to format the rest of the text. A paragraph style is a 
collection of type attributes that you can apply to an entire paragraph with a single 
click. Paragraph styles in Photoshop are similar to styles in page layout applications 
such as Adobe InDesign and popular word-processing applications, but you’ll prob-
ably notice some differences in the way they work. By default, all text you create in 
Photoshop has the Basic paragraph style applied.

9  Choose Right from the Alignment menu, and then click OK.
applying paragraph styles
Applying a paragraph style is easy. With the text selected, simply click the style 
name. If the text has been changed from the Basic paragraph style, Photoshop 
retains those overrides and applies only the attributes of the style that do not con-
flict with the overrides. In that case, clear overrides to apply all the style’s attributes.
1 Select the “What’s Hot” text, and then select Cover Teasers in the Paragraph 
Styles panel.
Photoshop applies some of the Cover Teasers attributes to the paragraph, but not  
all of them because there were style overrides in effect when you applied the style.
2 Click the Clear Override button ( ) at the bottom of the Paragraph Styles panel.
3 Select the text beneath “What’s Hot,” and then select Teaser subheads in the 
Paragraph Styles panel. Click the Clear Override button again.
4 Repeat steps 1–3 for the “What’s Not” and “Coming this year” sections.
Now there is just one more change to make to specific areas of the text.
5 Select “Coming this year” and all the text that 
follows it. Then, in the Character panel, change 
the text color to Black.
6 Finally, click the Commit Any Current Edits 
button to accept the type changes.

Opentype in Photoshop
OpenType is a cross-platform font file format developed jointly by Adobe and 
Microsoft. The format uses a single font file for both Mac OS and Windows, so you 
can move files from one platform to another without font substitution or reflowed 
text. OpenType offers widely expanded character sets and layout features, such as 
swashes and discretionary ligatures, that aren’t available in traditional PostScript 
and TrueType fonts. This, in turn, provides richer linguistic support and advanced 
typography control. Here are some highlights of OpenType. 
The OpenType menu The Character panel menu includes an OpenType submenu  
that displays all available features for a selected OpenType font, including ligatures, 
alternates, and fractions. Dimmed features are unavailable for that typeface;  
a check mark appears next to features that have been applied.
Discretionary ligatures To add a discretionary ligature to two OpenType letters,  
such as to “th” in the Bickham Script Standard typeface, select them in the image,  
and choose OpenType > Discretionary Ligatures from the Character panel menu. 
Swashes Adding swashes or alternate characters works the same way. Select the 
letter, such as a capital “T” in Bickham Script, and choose OpenType > Swash to 
change the ordinary capital into a dramatically ornate swash T. 
Creating true fractions Type fractions as usual—for example, 1/2—and then select 
the characters, and from the Character panel menu, choose OpenType > Fractions. 
Photoshop applies the true fraction (1/2).
adding vertical type
You’re almost done with the text for the magazine cover. All that remains to do is to 
add the volume number in the upper right corner. You’ll use vertical type to add it.
1 Choose Select > Deselect Layers. Then select the Vertical Type tool (
), which 
is hidden under the Horizontal Type tool.
2 Press the Shift key, and begin dragging in the upper right corner of the cover, 
near the letter “L.” Release the Shift key, and drag a vertical rectangle. 
Pressing the Shift key as you begin dragging ensures that you create a new text box 
instead of selecting the title.
3 Type VOL 9.
E Tip: Use the Adobe 
Illustrator Glyphs panel 
to preview OpenType 
options: Copy your text 
in Photoshop and paste 
it into an Illustrator 
document. Then, 
choose Window > 
Type > Glyphs.  
Select the text you  
want to change, 
and choose Show >

4 Select the letters either by dragging or triple-clicking them, and then, in the 
Character panel, select the following:
• Font Family: a serif typeface, such as Myriad Pro
• Font Style: a light or narrow style, such as Light Condensed
• Font size: 15 pt
• Tracking: 150
• Color: Black
5 Click the Commit Any Current Edits button ( ) in the options bar.  
Your vertical text now appears as the layer named VOL 9. Use the Move

4
What is a paragraph style?
review answers
1 Type in Photoshop consists of mathematically defined shapes that describe the letters, 
numbers, and symbols of a typeface. When you add type to an image in Photoshop, 
the characters are composed of pixels and have the same resolution as the image file. 
However, Photoshop preserves the vector-based type outlines and uses them when you 
scale or resize type, save a PDF or EPS file, or print the image to a PostScript printer.
2 Type that is added to an image appears in the Layers panel as a text layer that can be 
edited and managed in the same way as any other kind of layer. You can add and edit 
the text, change the orientation of the type, and apply anti-aliasing as well as move, 
restack, copy, and change the options for layers.
3 A clipping mask is an object or group whose shape masks other artwork so that only 
areas that lie within the shape are visible. To convert the letters on any text layer to  
a clipping mask, select both the text layer and the layer you want to show through the 
letters, and then choose Create Clipping Mask from the Layers panel menu.
4 A paragraph style is a collection of type attributes that you can quickly apply to an 
entire paragraph.

Unlike bitmap images, vector images retain their 
crisp edges when you enlarge them to any size. You 
can draw vector shapes and paths in your Photoshop 
images and add vector masks to control what is 
shown in an image.

lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
about bitmap images and vector graphics
Before working with vector shapes and vector paths, it’s important to understand 
the basic differences between the two main categories of computer graphics: bit-
map images and vector graphics. You can use Photoshop to work with either type 
of graphic; in fact, you can combine both bitmap and vector data in an individual 
Photoshop image file.
Bitmap images, technically called raster images, are based on a grid of dots known 
as pixels. Each pixel is assigned a specific location and color value. In working with 
bitmap images, you edit groups of pixels rather than objects or shapes. Because bit-
map graphics can represent subtle gradations of shade and color, they are appropri-
ate for continuous-tone images such as photographs or artwork created in painting 
programs. A disadvantage of bitmap graphics is that they contain a fixed number of 
pixels. As a result, they can lose detail and appear jagged when scaled up onscreen 
or printed at a lower resolution than they were created for. 
Vector graphics are made up of lines and curves defined by mathematical objects 
called vectors. These graphics retain their crispness whether they are moved, 
resized, or have their color changed. Vector graphics are appropriate for illustra-
tions, type, and graphics such as logos that may be scaled to different sizes.

about paths and the Pen tool
In Photoshop, the outline of a vector shape 
is a path. A path is a curved or straight 
line segment you draw using the Pen tool, 
Freeform Pen tool, or a shape tool. The 
Pen tool draws paths with the greatest 
precision; shape tools draw rectangles, 
ellipses, and other shape paths; the 
Freeform Pen tool draws paths as if you  
were drawing with a pencil on paper.

tool tips from the Photoshop 
evangelist
accessing tools quickly
Each tool in the Tools panel has a single-letter keyboard shortcut. Type the letter, 
get the tool. Press Shift with the shortcut key to cycle though any nested tools in 
a group. For example, press P to select the Pen tool, and press Shift+P to toggle 
between the Pen and Freeform Pen tools.
Paths can be open or closed. An open path (such as a wavy line) has two distinct 
endpoints. A closed path (such as a circle) is continuous. The type of path you draw 
affects how it can be selected and adjusted. 
Paths that have no fill or stroke do not print when you print your artwork. This is 
because paths are vector objects that contain no pixels, unlike the bitmap shapes 
drawn by the Pencil tool and other painting tools.
Getting started
Before you begin, you’ll view the image you’ll be creating—a poster for a fictitious 
toy company.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.)
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.

3 Click the Mini Bridge tab to open the Mini Bridge panel. If Bridge isn’t running 
in the background, click Launch Bridge.
4 In the Mini Bridge panel, choose Favorites from the pop-up menu on the left. 
Double-click the Lessons folder, and then double-click the Lesson08 folder.
5 Select the 08End.psd file, and press the spacebar to see it in full-screen view. 
To create this poster, you’ll work with an image of a toy spaceship, and practice 
making paths and selections using the Pen tool. As you create the background 
shapes and type, you’ll learn more about shape layers and vector masks,  
as well as ways to use Smart Objects.
6 When you’ve finished looking at 08End.psd, press the spacebar again. Then 
double-click the 08Start.psd file to open it in Photoshop.
7 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 08Working.psd, and click Save.  
Click OK in the Photoshop Format Options dialog box.
using paths with artwork
You’ll use the Pen tool to select the toy spaceship. The spaceship has long, smooth, 
curved edges that would be difficult to select using other methods.
You’ll draw a path around the spaceship, and create another path inside it. You’ll 
convert the paths to selections, and then subtract one selection from the other so 
that only the spaceship and none of the background is selected. Finally, you’ll make 
a new layer from the spaceship image, and change the image that appears behind it.
When drawing a freehand path  
using the Pen tool, use as few  
points as possible to create the  
shape you want. The fewer points  
you use, the smoother the curves  
are—and the more efficient your  
file is.
 Note: If you open 
the 08End.psd file in 
Photoshop, you might 
be prompted to update 
type layers. If so, click 
Update. You may 
need to update type 
layers when files are 
transferred between 
computers, especially 
between operating 
systems.

Creating paths with the Pen tool
You can use the Pen tool to create paths that are straight or curved, open or closed. If you’re unfamil-
iar with the Pen tool, it can be confusing to use at first. Understanding the elements of a path  
and how to create them with the Pen tool makes paths much easier to draw.
To create a straight path, click the mouse button. The first time you  
click, you set the starting point. Each time that you click thereafter, 
a straight line is drawn between the previous point and the current 
point. To draw complex straight-segment paths with the Pen tool, 
simply continue to add points.
To create a curved path, click to place an anchor point, drag to create 
a direction line for that point, and then click to place the next anchor 
point. Each direction line ends in two direction points; the positions of 
direction lines and points determine the size and shape of the curved 
segment. Moving the direction lines and points reshapes the curves 
in a path.
Smooth curves are connected by anchor points called smooth points. 
Sharply curved paths are connected by corner points. When you move 
a direction line on a smooth point, the curved segments on both sides 
of the point adjust simultaneously, but when you move 
a direction line on a corner point, only the curve on the same side of 
the point as the direction line is adjusted.
Path segments and anchor points can be moved after they’re drawn, 
either individually or as a group. When a path contains more than one 
segment, you can drag individual anchor points to adjust individual 
segments of the path, or select all of the anchor points in a path to 
edit the entire path. Use the Direct Selection tool to select and adjust 
an anchor point, a path segment, or an entire path.
Creating a closed path differs from creating an open path in the way 
that you end it. To end an open path, click the Pen tool in the Tools  
panel. To create a closed path, position the Pen tool pointer over the  
starting point, and click. Closing a path automatically ends the path.  
After the path closes, the Pen tool pointer appears with a small x,  
indicating that your next click will start a new path.
As you draw paths, a temporary storage area named Work Path appears in the Paths panel. It’s a good 
idea to save work paths, and it’s essential if you use multiple discrete paths in the same image file. If 
you deselect an existing Work Path in the Paths panel and then start drawing again, a new work path 
will replace the original one, which will be lost. To save a work path, double-click it in the Paths panel, 
type a name in the Save Path dialog box, and click OK to rename and save the path. The path remains 
selected in the Paths panel.

The Paths panel displays thumbnail previews of the paths you draw. Currently, the 
panel is empty, because you haven’t started drawing.
5 If necessary, zoom in so that you can easily see the lettered points and red dots 
on the shape template. Make sure you can see the whole template in the image 
window, and be sure to reselect the Pen tool after you zoom.
6 Click point A (the blue dot at the top of the spaceship), and release the mouse. 
You’ve set the first anchor point.
7 Click point B, and drag the cursor to the red dot labeled b. Release the mouse. 
You’ve set the direction of the curve.
E Tip: If you’re not 
familiar with the Pen

17 Click points O and P, leaving straight lines. Click Point Q, and drag the handle to 
the corresponding red dot to create the curve around the tail of the fin. 
18 Click at points R and S without dragging to create straight lines.
19 Move the pointer over point A so that a small circle appears in the pointer icon, 
indicating that you are about to close the path. (The small circle may be difficult 
to see.) Drag from point A to the red dot labeled “final,” and then release the 
mouse button to draw the last curved line. 
20 In the Paths panel, double-click Work Path, type Spaceship in the Save Path 
dialog box, and click OK to save it.
21 Choose File > Save to save your work. 
Converting selections to paths 
Now, you’ll create a second path using a different method. First you’ll use a selec-
tion tool to select a similarly colored area, and then you’ll convert the selection to a 
path. (You can convert any selection made with a selection tool into a path.)
1 Click the Layers tab to display the Layers panel, and then drag the Template 
layer to the Delete button at the bottom of the panel. You no longer need  
this layer.

2 Select the Magic Wand tool (
) in the Tools panel, hidden under the Quick 
Selection tool.
3 In the options bar, make sure the Tolerance value is 32.
4 Carefully click the green area inside the spaceship’s vertical fin. 
5 Click the Paths tab to bring the Paths panel forward. Then, click the Make Work 
Path From Selection button ( ) at the bottom of the panel. 
The selection is converted to a path, and a new work path is created. 
6 Double-click the path named Work Path, name it Fin, and then click OK to save 
the path. 
7 Choose File > Save to save your work.

216 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
Converting paths to selections
Just as you can convert selection borders to paths, you can convert paths to selec-
tions. With their smooth outlines, paths let you make precise selections. Now that 
you’ve drawn paths for the spaceship and its fin, you’ll convert those paths to a 
selection and apply a filter to the selection. 
1 In the Paths panel, click the Spaceship path to make it active. 
2 Choose Make Selection from the Paths panel menu, and then click OK to 
convert the Spaceship path to a selection.
Next, you’ll subtract the Fin selection from the Spaceship selection so that you can 
see the background through the vacant areas in the fin. 
3 In the Paths panel, click the Fin path to make it active. Then, from the Paths 
panel menu, choose Make Selection. 
4 In the Operation area of the Make Selection dialog box, select Subtract From 
Selection, and click OK.
The Fin path is simultaneously converted to a selection and subtracted from the 
Spaceship selection. 
Leave the paths selected, because you’ll use them in the next exercise.
E Tip: You can also 
click the Load Path 
As Selection button 
at the bottom of the 
Paths panel to convert 
the active path to a 
selection.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 217
Converting the selection to a layer
Now you’ll see how creating the selection with the Pen tool can help you achieve 
interesting effects. Because you’ve isolated the spaceship, you can create a duplicate 
of it on a new layer. Then, you can copy it to another image file—specifically, to the 
image that’s the background for the toy-store poster.
1 Make sure that you can still see the selection outline in the image window. If 
you can’t, repeat the previous exercise, “Converting paths to selections.” 
2 Choose Layer > New > Layer Via Copy.
3 Click the Layers tab to bring the Layers panel 
to the front. A new layer appears in the Layers 
panel, called Layer 2. The Layer 2 thumbnail 
shows that the layer contains only the image 
of the spaceship, not the background of the 
original layer.
4 In the Layers panel, rename Layer 2 Spaceship, 
and press Enter or Return.
5 Choose File > Open, and double-click the 08Landscape.psd file in the Lessons/
Lesson08 folder.
The 08Landscape.psd file contains the landscape that you’ll use as the background 
for the spaceship.
6 Choose Window > Arrange > 2 Up Vertical so that you can see both the open 
files. Click the 08Working.psd image to make it active.
7 Select the Move tool (
), and drag the spaceship from the 08Working.psd 
image window to the 08Landscape.psd image window so that the spaceship 
appears to be hovering over the planet.
8 Close the 08Working.psd image without saving changes, leaving the 
08Landscape.psd file open and active.

218 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
Now you’ll position the spaceship more precisely over the poster background.
9 Select the Spaceship layer in the Layers panel, and choose Edit > Free Transform. 
A bounding box appears around the spaceship.
10 Position the pointer near any corner handle until it turns into the rotate cursor  
( ), and then drag to rotate the spaceship until its angle is about -12 degrees. 
For precise rotation, you can enter the value in the Rotate box in the options 
bar. When you’re satisfied, press Enter or Return.
11 Make sure the Spaceship layer is still selected, and then use the Move tool to 
drag the ship so that it grazes the top of the planet, as in the third image.
12 Choose File > Save As, rename the file 08B_Working.psd, and click Save. Click 
OK in the Photoshop Format Options dialog box.
Creating vector objects for the background
Many posters are designed to be scalable, either up or down, while retaining a crisp 
appearance: a good use for vector shapes. Next, you’ll create vector shapes with 
paths, and use masks to control what appears in the poster. Because they’re vectors, 
the shapes can be scaled in future design revisions without a loss of quality or detail.
Drawing a scalable shape
You’ll begin by creating a white kidney-shaped object for the backdrop  
of the poster.
1 Choose View > Rulers to display the horizontal and vertical rulers.
 Note: If you 
accidentally distort the 
spaceship instead of 
rotating it, press Esc and 
start over.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 219
2 Drag the tab for the Paths panel out of the Layers panel group so that it floats 
independently. Since you’ll be using the Layers and Paths panels frequently in 
this exercise, it’s convenient to have them separated.
3 Toggle the eye icons in the Layers panel to show the Retro Shape Guide and 
Background layers, and to hide the other two layers. Select the Background layer 
to make it active.
The guide layer will serve as a template as you draw the kidney shape. 
4 In the Tools panel, select the Pen tool (
). 
5 In the options bar, choose Shape from the pop-up menu, and then click  
the Fill color. Select white for the fill color.

220 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
6 Create the shape by clicking and dragging as follows: 
•
Click point A, drag a direction line up to point B, and then release. 
•
Click point C, drag a direction line to point D, and then release.
•
Continue to draw curved segments in this way around the shape until you 
return to point A, and then click point A to close the path. Don’t worry if the 
shape flips in on itself; it will right itself as you continue.
Notice that as you drew, Photoshop automatically created a new layer, Shape 1, just 
above the active layer (the Background layer) in the Layers panel.
7 Double-click the Shape 1 layer name, rename the layer Retro Shape, and press 
Enter or Return.
8 Hide the Retro Shape Guide layer in the Layers panel.
 Note: If you have 
trouble, open the 
spaceship image again 
and practice drawing 
the path around the 
spaceship shape 
until you get more 
comfortable with 
drawing curved path 
segments. Also, be sure 
to read the sidebar, 
“Creating paths with the 
Pen tool.”

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 221
Deselecting paths 
You may need to deselect paths to see the appropriate options in the options bar 
when you select a vector tool. Deselecting paths can also help you view certain 
effects that might be obscured if a path is highlighted. 
Notice that the border between the white kidney shape and the background has a 
grainy quality. What you see is actually the path itself, which is a nonprinting item. 
This is a visual clue that the Retro Shape layer is still selected. Before proceeding to 
the next exercise, you’ll make sure that all paths are deselected.
1 In the Paths panel, click in the empty area beneath the path to deselect all paths.
2 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Changing the fill color of a shape layer
You created the shape with a white fill so that it was easy to see. But for the poster, 
you’ll change the color of the shape to blue.
1 Select the Pen tool in the Tools panel, if it’s not already selected.
2 In the options bar, click the Fill color. Select the Light Cyan Blue color. 
The fill color of the shape changes to the blue you selected.
subtracting shapes from a shape layer
After you create a shape layer (vector graphic), you can set options to subtract 
new shapes from the vector graphic. You can also use the Path Selection tool and 
the Direct Selection tool to move, resize, and edit shapes. You’ll add some inter-
est to the retro shape by subtracting a star shape from it, allowing the outer-space 
background to show through. To help you position the star, you’ll refer to the Star 
Guide layer, which has been created for you. Currently, that layer is hidden.

222 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
1 In the Layers panel, show the Star Guide layer, but leave the Retro Shape layer 
selected. The Star Guide layer is now visible in the image window.
2 In the Paths panel, select the Retro Shape shape path.
3 In the Tools panel, select the Polygon tool (
), hidden under the Rectangle  
tool ( ). 
4 On the options bar, do the following:
•
For Sides, type 11.
•
From the Path Operations pop-up menu, choose Subtract Front Shape.  
The pointer now appears as cross-hairs with a small minus sign (
).
•
Click the Settings icon to the left of the Sides option to display the Polygon 
Options window. Select Star, and type 50% in the Indent Sides By box. Then 
click an empty area of the options bar to close the window.
5 Click on the orange dot in the center of the orange circle in the image window, 
and drag outward until the tips of the star rays touch the circle’s perimeter.
 Note: As you drag, 
you can rotate the star 
by dragging the pointer 
to the side.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 223
When you release the mouse button, the star shape becomes a cutout, allowing the 
sky to show through. 
Notice that the star has a grainy outline, reminding you that the shape is selected. 
Another indication that the shape is selected is that the Retro Shape shape path is 
selected in the Paths panel.
6 In the Layers panel, hide the Star Guide layer.
Notice that the thumbnails in both the Layers panel and Paths panel show the retro 
shape with the star-shaped cutout.
7 Click in the area beneath the path in the Paths panel to deselect the path.
The path is now deselected, and the grainy path lines have disappeared, leaving a 
sharp edge between the blue areas and the sky. Also, the Retro Shape shape path is 
no longer highlighted in the Paths panel. That shape is pretty bright, though, and 
may overpower the spaceship. You’ll make the shape semitransparent. 
8 In the Layers panel, reduce the opacity of the Retro Shape layer to 40%.
9 Choose File > Save to save your work.

224 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
Working with defined custom shapes
Another way to use shapes in your artwork is to draw a custom or preset shape. 
Doing so is as easy as selecting the Custom Shape tool, picking a shape from the 
Custom Shape Picker, and dragging in the image window. You’ll do just that to add 
checkerboard patterns and clumps of grass to the background of your poster for the 
toy store. 
1 Make sure the Retro Shape layer is selected in the Layers panel. Then click the 
New Layer button ( ) to add a layer above it. Rename the new layer Pattern, 
and then press Enter or Return.
2 In the Tools panel, select the Custom Shape tool (
), which is hidden under the 
Polygon tool (
).
3 In the options bar, choose Pixels from the Tool Mode menu. 
4 In the options bar, click the arrow next to the Shape option to open the Custom 
Shape Picker. 
5 Double-click the checkerboard preset in the Custom Shape Picker (you may 
need to scroll or drag the corner of the picker to see it) to select it and close  
the picker. 
6 Make sure that the foreground color is white. Then press Shift and drag 
diagonally in the image window to draw and size the shape so that it’s about 2 
inches square. 
Pressing Shift constrains the shape to its original proportions.
 Note: The options in 
the options bar change 
depending on what you 
choose from the Tool 
Mode menu. When you 
work in Shape mode, 
you can select a fill or 
stroke in the options 
bar; in Pixels mode, 
those options aren’t 
available. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 225
7 Add five more checkerboards of various sizes until your poster resembles the 
figure below.
8 In the Layers panel, reduce the opacity of the Pattern layer to 75%.
9 In the Layers panel, show the Spaceship layer so you can see the whole 
composition.
You’ll use the Custom Shape tool to add clumps of grass to the background. You can 
apply a fill and stroke to shapes when you work in Shape mode.

226 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
10 With the Custom Shape tool still selected, open the Custom Shape Picker, and 
double-click the clump of grass (called Grass 2). 
11 Choose Shape from the Tool Mode menu. Then, select Dark Yellow Green for 
the Fill color, select Darker Green Cyan for the Stroke color, and enter .75 for 
the stroke width.
12 Press Shift as you draw four clumps of grass in the lower left corner of the 
background and an additional clump in the lower right corner.
Pressing Shift as you draw ensures that all the shapes are on the same layer.
13 Select the Path Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and then Shift-select all five 
clumps of grass. 
14 Choose Distribute Widths from the Path Alignment menu in the options bar.
Photoshop distributes the grass clumps evenly across the bottom of the 
background.
15 Rename the layer Grass, change its opacity to 60%, and drag the layer just above 
the Background layer in the Layers panel.
16 Deselect the layer, and then choose File > Save to save your work so far.
E Tip: If the clumps  
of grass are on separate 
layers, you weren’t 
holding down the Shift 
key as you drew them. 
Delete the grass, and 
repeat steps 12–13.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 227
Importing a smart Object
Smart Objects are layers that you can edit in Photoshop nondestructively; that is, 
changes you make to the image remain editable and don’t affect the actual image 
pixels, which are preserved. Regardless of how often you scale, rotate, skew, or 
otherwise transform a Smart Object, it retains its sharp, precise edges. 
You can import vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as Smart Objects. If you edit 
the original object in Illustrator, the changes will be reflected in the placed Smart 
Object in your Photoshop image file. You’ll work with a Smart Object now by plac-
ing text created in Illustrator into the toy-store poster.
adding the title
The toy-store name was created in Illustrator. You’ll add it to the poster now. 
1 Select the Move tool (
) in the Tools panel. Then select the Spaceship layer, 
and choose File > Place. Navigate to the Lessons/Lesson08 folder, select the 
Title.ai file, and click Place. Click OK in the Place PDF dialog box that appears. 
The Retro Toyz text is added to the middle of the composition, inside a bounding 
box with adjustable handles. A new layer, Title, appears in the Layers panel. 
2 Drag the Retro Toyz object to the upper left corner of the poster, and then press 
Shift and drag a corner to make the text object proportionally larger— 
so that it fills the top portion of the poster, as in the following figure. When 
you’ve finished, either press Enter or Return, or click the Commit Transform 
button ( ) in the options bar.
When you commit to the transformation, the layer thumbnail icon changes to 
reflect that the title layer is a Smart Object.
As with any shape layer or Smart Object, you can continue to edit its size and shape 
if you’d like. Simply select the layer, choose Edit > Free Transform to access the con-
trol handles, and drag to adjust them. Or, select the Move tool (
), and select Show 
Transform Controls in the options bar. Then adjust the handles.

228 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
adding a vector mask to a smart Object
For a fun effect, you’ll turn the center of each letter “O” in the title into a star that 
matches the cutout you created earlier. You’ll use a vector mask, which you can link 
to a Smart Object in Photoshop.
1 Select the Title layer, and then choose Layer > Vector Mask > Reveal All. 
2 Select the Polygon tool (
), hidden beneath the Custom Shape tool (
). The 
options you used earlier to create the star should still be in effect: settings for an 
11-sided star with a 50% indent. The Polygon tool holds your settings until you 
change them again.
3 Choose Path from the Tool Mode menu in the options bar. Make sure Subtract 
From Front is still selected from the Path Operations menu. Then select the 
vector mask thumbnail in the Title layer.
4 Click in the center of the “O” in “Toyz,” and drag the cursor outward until the 
star covers the center of the “O.” 
5 Repeat step 4 to add a star in the small “O” in Retro. 
rotating the canvas (OpenGL only)
You’ve been working with the image with “Retro Toyz” at the top of the work area 
and the ground at the bottom. But if your video card supports OpenGL, you can 
rotate the work area to draw, type, or position objects from a different perspective. 
You’ll rotate the view as you add a copyright statement along the side of the image. 
(If your video card doesn’t support OpenGL, skip this section.)

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 229
First, you’ll type the text.
1 Choose Window > Character to open the Character panel. Select a serif font 
such as Myriad Pro with a small size such as 10 pt, and set the color to white.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool, and then click in the lower left corner of  
the image. Type Copyright YOUR NAME Productions, substituting your  
own name.
You want the copyright to run along the left side of the image. You’ll rotate the 
canvas to make it easier to place.
3 Select the Rotate View tool (
), hidden beneath the Hand tool (
). 
4 Press the Shift key as you drag the tool in an arc to rotate the canvas 90 degrees 
clockwise. Pressing the Shift key restrains the rotation to 45-degree increments.
5 Select the Copyright text layer, and then choose Edit > Transform > Rotate  
90° CCW.
E Tip: You can also 
enter a value in the 
Rotation Angle box in 
the options bar.

230 
lesson 8 Vector drawing techniques
6 Use the Move tool to align the text along the top edge of the image, which will 
be the left edge when it is in its usual position.
7 Select the Rotate View tool again, and then click Reset View in the options bar.
8 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Finishing up
As a final step, clean up the Layers panel by deleting your guide template layers.
1 Make sure that the Copyright, Title, Spaceship, Pattern, Retro Shape, Grass, and 
Background layers are the only visible layers in the Layers panel.
2 Choose Delete Hidden Layers from the Layers panel menu, and then  
click Yes to confirm the deletion.
3 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Congratulations! You’ve finished the poster. It should look similar to the

review answers
1 If you need to create an intricate selection, it can be easier to draw the path with the 
Pen tool and then convert the path to a selection.
2 Bitmap, or raster, images are based on a grid of pixels and are appropriate for 
continuous-tone images such as photographs or artwork created in painting programs. 
Vector graphics are made up of shapes based on mathematical expressions and are 
appropriate for illustrations, type, and drawings that require clear, smooth lines.
3 A shape layer is a vector layer that contains either a shape (including fill and stroke), 
pixels, or a path.
4 You use the Path Selection tool and the Direct Selection tool to move, resize, and 
edit shapes. You can also modify and scale a shape or path by choosing Edit > Free 
Transform Path.
5 Smart Objects are vector objects that you can place and edit in Photoshop without  
a loss of quality. Regardless of how often you scale, rotate, skew, or otherwise 
transform a Smart Object, it retains sharp, precise edges. A great benefit of using 
Smart Objects is that you can edit the original object in the authoring application, such 
as Illustrator, and the changes will be reflected in the placed Smart Object in  
your Photoshop image file.

Filters can transform ordinary images into extraor-
dinary digital artwork. Choose from filters that blur, 
bend, sharpen, or fragment images, or that simulate 
a traditional artistic medium, such as watercolor. You 
can also use adjustment layers and painting modes to 
vary the look of your artwork.

Advanced Compositing
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create souvenirs from a vacation to Washington, D.C. You’ll 
assemble a montage of images for a postcard, and then stitch together a panorama 
to create a poster. First, look at the final projects to see what you’ll be creating. 
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Click the Mini Bridge tab at the bottom of the application window to open the 
Mini Bridge panel. If Bridge is not running in the background, click Launch 
Bridge to start it.
4 In the Mini Bridge panel, choose Favorites from the menu on the left, and then 
double-click the Lessons folder. Select the Lesson09 folder.
5 View the 09A_End.psd thumbnail, and press the spacebar for a full-screen view.
This file is a postcard that comprises four photos. Each image has had a specific 
filter or effect applied to it. 
6 Press the spacebar to return to Photoshop. Then, select the 09B_End.psd 
thumbnail, and press the spacebar to see a full-screen view of it.
This file is a poster with a panoramic image and text. You’ll create the postcard 
with multiple images first.
7 Press the spacebar to return to 
Photoshop. Then, double-click the  
09A_Start.jpg thumbnail to open the  
file in Photoshop.
assembling a montage of images
The postcard is a montage of four different images. You’ll crop each image, and add 
them as separate layers to a composite image. Using guides, you’ll align the images 
precisely with minimal effort. Before you make additional changes to the images, 
you’ll add the text and apply effects to it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 235
Opening and cropping the images
The images you’ll use in the insets are larger than you need, so you’ll crop them 
before combining them in a composite file. Cropping images involves aesthetic 
choices about where and how much of the image to crop. The 09A_Start.jpg file is 
already open, so you’ll start with it.
1 Select the Crop tool ( ). In the options bar, choose Size & Resolution from the 
Select A Preset Aspect Ratio menu. Then, in the Crop Image Size & Resolution 
dialog box, enter 500 pixels for the Width, 500 pixels for the Height, and 300 
pixels/inch for the Resolution. Click OK.
The cropped image will be 500 pixels by 500 pixels.
2 Resize and reposition the crop box so that the Smithsonian Institution is the 
focus of the cropped area. You can use the Right Arrow and Left Arrow keys on 
your keyboard to nudge the crop box into position if necessary. 
3 When you’re satisfied with the crop area, select Delete Cropped Pixels in the 
options bar, and then press Enter or Return to apply the crop.
Because you’re working with several files, you’ll give the 09A_Start.jpg file a  
descriptive name, so that it will be easy to identify. You’ll also save the file in the 
Photoshop format, because each time you edit and then resave a JPEG file, its  
quality degrades. 
 Note: Be sure to 
enter 500 pixels, not 
500 inches!

Positioning images using guides
Guides are nonprinting lines that help you align elements in your document, either 
horizontally or vertically. If you choose a Snap To command, the guides behave like 
magnets: When you drag an object close to a guide and then release the mouse but-
ton, the object snaps into place along the guide. You’ll add guides to the background 
image that you’ll use as the basis for the composite.
1 Choose View > Rulers. Rulers appear along the top and left edges of the window.
2 Choose Window > Info to open the Info panel. 
3 From the horizontal ruler, drag a guide to the middle of the image, and release 
the mouse when the Y coordinate value in the Info panel is 3.000 inches. A blue 
guide line appears across the image.
4 Drag another guide, this time from the vertical ruler, and release the mouse 
when X = 3.000 inches.
5 Choose View > Snap To, and make sure Guides is selected.
6 Drag another guide from the vertical ruler to the middle of the image. Though 
you could move it further, it snaps into place at the exact midpoint of the image.
7 Choose Window > Arrange > 4-Up. All four images are visible, each in its own 
window.
 Note: If the ruler 
units are marked in  
a unit other than  
inches, right-click or  
Control-click a ruler,  
and choose Inches from 
the context menu.
E Tip: If you need to 
adjust a ruler guide, 
use the Move tool. You 
may need to zoom in 
to move the ruler to a 
precise coordinate.

It was easy to align the images using centered guides, but for greater precision, 
Smart Guides are an excellent way to align photos and objects. Using your working 
file as it is after the “Positioning images using guides” exercise, you can try another 
way to align these photos; or continue with the lesson and try this technique some 
other time. 
1
Select the Museum layer in the Layers panel. In the image window, use the 
Move tool to move the image out of alignment. 
2
Choose View > Show > Smart Guides.
3
Using the Move tool, drag the Museum image in the image window to align its 
top edge with the top edge of the monument.

applying filters
Photoshop includes many filters for creating special effects. The best way to learn 
about them is to test different filters with various options on your files. You can use 
the Filter Gallery to preview a filter’s effect on your image without committing to it.
You’ve used filters in some earlier lessons. In this lesson, you’ll apply the Graphic 
Pen filter to the museum image for a hand-sketched effect.
Improving performance with filters
Some filter effects can be memory-intensive, especially when applied to a high-
resolution image. You can use these techniques to improve performance:
•
Test filters and settings on a small portion of an image.
•
Apply the effect to individual channels—for example, to each RGB channel—if 
the image is large and you’re having problems with insufficient memory. (Note, 
however, that some filters may produce different results when you apply them 
to individual channels rather than the composite image, especially if the filter 
randomly modifies pixels.)
•
Free up memory before running the filter by using the Purge commands in the 
Edit menu.
•
Close other open applications to free more memory for Photoshop. If you’re 
using Mac OS, allocate more RAM to Photoshop.
•
Try changing settings to improve the speed of memory-intensive filters such as 
Lighting Effects, Cutout, Stained Glass, Chrome, Ripple, Spatter, Sprayed Strokes, 
and Glass filters. For example, with the Stained Glass filter, you might increase 
cell size. With the Cutout filter, try increasing Edge Simplicity, decreasing Edge 
Fidelity, or both.
•
If you plan to print to a grayscale printer, convert a copy of the image to 
grayscale before applying filters. However, applying a filter to a color image and 
then converting to grayscale may not have the same effect as applying the filter 
to a grayscale version of the image.

using filters
As you consider which filter to use and the effect it might have, keep in mind 
the following:
•
The last filter chosen appears at the top of the Filter menu.
•
Filters are applied to the active, visible layer.
•
Filters cannot be applied to bitmap-mode or indexed-color images.
•
Some filters work only on RGB images.
•
Some filters are processed entirely in RAM.
•
To apply more than one filter in the Filter Gallery, click the New Filter button at 
the bottom of the filters list, and then select a filter.
•
See “Using filters” in Photoshop Help for a list of filters that can be used with 16- 
and 32-bit-per-channel images.
•
Photoshop Help provides specific information on individual filters.

hand-coloring selections on a layer
Before the days of color photography, artists painted color onto black-and-white 
images. You can create the same effect by hand-coloring selections on a layer. In 
this exercise, you’ll hand-color the museum image, and then add stars to the sky in 
the background image.
applying painting effects
You’ll use different brushes, with varying opacities and blending modes, to add 
color to the sky, grass, and building in the museum image.
1 In the Layers panel, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the 
image thumbnail on the Museum layer. The contents of the layer are selected. 
You can paint only within the selection, so you don’t need to worry about painting 
the background image or the other images. Just make sure you see the selection 
border around the image before you start painting.
2 Zoom in on the museum image so that you can see it clearly. 
3 Select the Brush tool (
). In the options bar, select a 90-pixel brush with a 
hardness of 0. Choose Darken from the Mode menu. Set the brush opacity to 20%.
4 Click the Foreground Color swatch in the Tools panel, and select a color of 
bright blue (not too light). You’ll use this color to paint the sky.
5 Paint the sky in the museum image. Because the opacity is set to 20%, you can 
paint over the same area again to darken it. Don’t be afraid to paint near the 
borders; nothing outside the image border is affected by the paintbrush. You 
can change the brush size and opacity as you paint; for example, you may need a 
smaller brush to paint the areas between treetops. If you make a mistake, press 
Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS) to undo it. But remember that 
you’re going for a handpainted look; it doesn’t need to be perfect.
E Tip: You can change 
the brush opacity by 
pressing a number on 
the keypad from 0 to 9  
(where 1 is 10%, 9 is 
90%, and 0 is 100%).
E Tip: To change the 
brush size as you paint, 
press the bracket keys 
on your keyboard. The 
Left Bracket key ([) 
decreases the brush 
size; the Right Bracket 
(]) increases it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 247
6 Paint the trees and grass the same way. Change the foreground color to green, 
and then set up a 70-pixel soft brush, using the Darken blending mode, and 
80% opacity. It’s fine to paint over the black sketched areas; only the white areas 
show much color.
7 Next, paint the museum façade a dark red color. Start with a 40-pixel brush, 
using the Lighten blending mode, and 80% opacity. 
Using the Lighten blending mode affects the black lines rather than the white areas. 
8 When you’re satisfied with the painting, choose Select > Deselect to deselect the 
image. Then choose File > Save to save your work.
saving selections
In order to fill the background sky with handpainted stars, you need to save a selec-
tion of the sky. First, you’ll save the background image as a Smart Object so that 
you can apply Smart Filters to it later.
E Tip: When hand-
coloring an image,  
work from the back-
ground forward, so that 
you can overpaint any 
stray marks.

applying smart Filters
Unlike regular filters, which permanently change an image, Smart Filters are non-
destructive: They can be adjusted, turned off and on, and deleted. However, you can 
apply Smart Filters only to a Smart Object.
You already converted the Capitol and Mall layer to a Smart Object. You’ll apply 
several Smart Filters to the layer, and then add some layer styles.
1 Select the Capitol and Mall layer in the Layers panel. Then choose Filter >  
Filter Gallery. 
Photoshop opens the Filter Gallery.
2 In the Filter Gallery, expand the Artistic folder, and then select Cutout.
The Cutout filter makes an image appear as if it were constructed from roughly cut 
pieces of colored paper. 
3  On the right side of the dialog box, change the Number Of Levels to 8, leave 
Edge Simplicity at 4, and move the Edge Fidelity slider to 3. Then click OK.
Smart Filters appear with the Smart Object in the Layers panel. An icon appears to 
the right of a layer name if filter effects are applied to a layer.
4 Double-click the Filter Gallery in the Layers panel to open the Filter Gallery 
again. Click the New Effect Layer button ( ) at the bottom of the applied filters 
list, and then select any filter. Experiment with the settings until you’re satisfied, 
but don’t click OK yet.
We chose Film Grain from the Artistic folder, and used the following settings: 
Grain 2, Highlight Area 6, and Intensity 1.

You can mix and match Smart Filters and turn them off and on. 
5 In the applied filters list in the Filter Gallery, drag the Cutout filter above the 
second filter you applied to see how the effect changes. Click OK to close the 
Filter Gallery.
The order in which you apply filters can change the effect. You can also hide an 
effect by clicking the eye icon ( ) next to its name in the filter list.
You’ll use filters to give the other inset images a handpainted look without going to 
all the trouble of painting them manually. First, you’ll convert them to Smart Objects.
6 Open the Montage images folder again, and 
select the Capitol layer. Then choose Filter >

the following:
•
Select the Preview option, if it’s not already selected.
•
Choose IMG_1441.psd from the Source menu. 
•
Choose the Background layer from the Layer menu. You can select any layer 
in the source image, but this image has only one layer.
•

You’ll apply the color match and sharpen action to one of the other three image 
files that you opened.
1 Click the IMG_1444.psd tab to make that image active.
2 In the Actions panel, select the color match and sharpen action in the My 
Actions set, and then click the Play button ( ).

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 261
The IMG_1444.psd image is automatically color matched, sharpened, and saved as 
a TIFF, and it now matches the IMG_1443.tif image for these properties. Because 
you recorded closing the file, the file has also been closed.
Batch-playing an action
Applying actions is a timesaving process for performing routine tasks on files, but 
you can streamline your work even further by applying actions to all open files. 
Two more files in this project need to be prepared for the panorama, so you’ll apply 
your automated action to them simultaneously. 
1 Make sure that the IMG_1445.psd and IMG_1446.psd files are open. Close the 
IMG_1441.psd file, and then open it again to ensure that it’s the third tab. 
2 Choose File > Automate > Batch.
3 In the Play area of the Batch dialog box, choose My Actions from the Set menu, 
and choose color match and sharpen from the Action menu.
4 Choose Opened Files from the Source menu. Leave Destination set to None, and 
click OK.
The action is applied to both IMG_1445.psd and IMG_1446.psd, so the files have 
the same color matching and sharpening and are saved as TIFF files. The same 
action was applied to IMG_1441.psd, even though its color was matched with itself. 
In this exercise, you batch-processed three files instead of making all the same 
changes in each of them; this was a mild convenience. But creating and applying 
actions can save significant amounts of time and tedium when you have dozens or 
even hundreds of files that require any routine, repetitive work.
 Note: If the 
IMG_1441.psd file is 
not the third tab, it 
will close before the 
color can be matched 
for one or both of the 
other images. Match 
Color requires that the 
source file be open. 
Simply rearranging the 
tabs doesn’t change 
the order in which 
Photoshop applies  
the action.

Advanced Compositing
stitching a panorama 
The files have been color matched, sharpened, and saved to prevent unsightly 
inconsistencies in your panorama. Now you’re ready to stitch the images together! 
Then, you’ll add a border with lettering to complete the poster.
1 With no files open in Photoshop, choose File > Automate > Photomerge.
2 In the Layout area of the dialog box, select Auto. Then, in the Source Files area, 
click Browse, and navigate to the Lesson09/Ready For Panorama folder. Shift-
select all the images in the folder, and click OK or Open.
3 At the bottom of the Photomerge dialog box, select Blend Images Together, 
Vignette Removal, and Geometric Distortion Correction. Then click OK.
Photoshop creates the panorama image. It’s a complex process, so you may have to 
wait several minutes while Photoshop works. When it’s finished, you should see an 
image that looks similar to the one below, with six layers in the Layers panel—one 
for each of the images. Photoshop has found the overlapping areas of the images 
and matched them, correcting any angular discrepancies. In the process, it left 
some empty areas. You’ll make the panorama tidy by adding a little sky to fill in 
some of the empty area, and by cropping the image.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 263
4 Select all the layers in the Layers panel, and then choose Layer > Merge Layers. 
5 Choose File > Save As. Choose Photoshop for the Format, and name the file 
09B_Working.psd. Save the file in the Lesson09 folder. Click Save, and then 
click OK in the Photoshop Format Options dialog box.
6 Select the Crop tool ( ). In the options bar, choose Unconstrained to remove 
any aspect ratio values, so you can crop to any size. Then drag the crop box to 
include the area from the edge of the grass (where its bottom edge is highest) to 
the highest point of the image (just above the highest museum tower). Crop out 
all the transparent areas on the sides. When you are satisfied with your cropped 
area, press Enter or Return, or click the Commit Current Crop Operation button 
( ) in the options bar.

8 Click in the transparent area on the right to select it, and then Shift-click in the 
transparent area on the left to add it to the selection.
9 Choose Edit > Fill.
10 In the Fill dialog box, choose Content-Aware from the Use menu, and click OK.
Photoshop fills the transparent area with color that blends with the existing sky.
11 Choose Select > Deselect.
12 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Finishing the image
The panorama looks great, but because of the wide angle, some of the lines are a 
little off. For example, several buildings lean unrealistically. You’ll use the Adaptive 
Wide Angle filter to correct the perspective, and then add lettering on the side for 
the final touch.
1 Choose Filter > Adaptive Wide Angle.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 265
2 In the Adaptive Wide Angle dialog box, select the Constraint tool (
). The 
Constraint tool lets you define the straight areas in the image; the filter adjusts 
the rest of the image to match the perspective you specify.
3 Click a point on the ground beneath the first tower, and then click another point 
at the base of the large tree, effectively drawing a straight line. 
As you release the mouse from the second point, the filter adjusts the perspective of 
the image. Next, you’ll adjust the ground under the Washington Monument so that 
it stands vertically.
4 Click in the center of the trees next to the monument, and then click again in 
the grass to the right of the momument, drawing a diagonal line, as in the image 
below. 
5 If you want to adjust the angle, click the rotation handle on the line you drew, 
and drag it up a few degrees.
You can continue to adjust the rotation on any line you drew until you close the 
filter dialog box.
6 When you’re satisfied, click OK to accept the changes and apply the filter to the 
image.
The poster needs only the lettering on the side to be complete.
E Tip: If transparent 
areas appear along the 
edge of the image, use 
the Scale option in the 
Adaptive Wide Angle 
filter to scale the image.

review answers
1 By saving a selection, you can create and reuse time-consuming selections and 
uniformly select artwork in an image. You can also combine selections or create new 
selections by adding to or subtracting from existing selections.
2 Use the Filter Gallery to test different filters with different settings to see the effect 
they’ll have on your image.
3 Smart Filters are nondestructive: They can be adjusted, turned off and on, and deleted 
at any time. In contrast, regular filters permanently change an image; once applied, 
they cannot be removed. Smart Filters can be applied only to a Smart Object layer. 
4 You can use the Match Color feature to match color between different images, such 
as to adjust the facial skin tones in photographs—or to match color between different 
layers in the same image. You can also use the feature to create unusual color effects.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: 
•
Create a video timeline in Photoshop. 
•
Add media to a video group in the Timeline panel.
•
Add motion to video clips and still images.
•
Animate type and effects using keyframes.
•
Add transitions between video clips.
•
Include audio in a video file.
•
Render a video.
This lesson will take about 90 minutes to complete. Copy the Lesson10 
folder onto your hard drive if you haven’t already done so. As you work  
on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need to restore the  
start files, copy them from the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a  
Book DVD.

269
Now you can edit video files in Photoshop using many 
of the same effects you use to edit image files. You 
can create a movie from video files, still images, Smart 
Objects, audio files, and type layers; apply transitions; 
and animate effects using keyframes. 

270 
lesson 10 
editing Video
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll edit a video that was shot using a camera phone. You’ll create a 
video timeline, import clips, add transitions and other video effects, and render the 
final video. First, look at the final project to see what you’ll be creating. 
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2
When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3
Choose File > Browse In Bridge.
4
In Bridge, select the Lessons folder in the Favorites panel. Then, double-click the 
Lesson10 folder in the Content panel.
5 Double-click the 10End.mp4 file to open it in QuickTime. 
6 Click the Play button in QuickTime to view the final video. 
The short video is a compilation of clips from a day at the beach. It includes transi-
tions, layer effects, animated text, and a musical.
7 Close QuickTime and return to Bridge.
8 Double-click the 10End.psd file to open it in Photoshop.
Photoshop displays the Timeline panel, and there are guidelines across the docu-
ment window. The guidelines identify the area that would be visible if the video is 
broadcast. The Timeline panel includes all the video clips and the audio track.
9 When you’ve finished exploring the end file, close it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 271
Creating a new video project
Working with video is a little different from working with still images in Photoshop. 
You may find it easiest to create the project first, and then import the assets you’ll 
be using. You’ll choose the video preset for this project, and then add nine video and 
image files to include in your movie.
Creating a new file
Photoshop CS6 includes several film and video presets for you to choose from. 
You’ll create a new file and select an appropriate preset.
1
Choose File > New.
2
Name the file 10Start.psd. 
3
Choose Film & Video from the Preset menu.
4
Choose HDV/HDTV 720p/29.97 from the Size menu.
5
Accept the default settings for the other options, and click OK.
6 Choose File > Save As, and save the file in the Lesson10 folder.
Importing assets
Photoshop CS6 includes tools specifically for working with video, such as the 
Timeline panel. The Timeline panel may already be open because you previewed 
the end file earlier. You use the Timeline panel to arrange layers in a video, animate 
their properties, set the start and end points for each layer, and apply transitions. To 
ensure you have access to the resources you need, you’ll select the Motion work-
space and organize your panels before you import files for the video.
 Note: The video in 
this lesson was shot 
using an Apple iPhone, 
so one of the HDV 
presets is appropriate. 
The 720P preset 
provides good quality 
without providing too 
much data for easy 
streaming online.

lesson 10 
editing Video
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Motion.
2 Pull the top edge of the Timeline panel up so that the panel occupies the bottom 
half of the workspace. 
3 Select the Zoom tool (
), and then click Fit Screen in the options bar so that 
you can see the entire canvas within the top half of the screen.
4 Click Create Video Timeline. Photoshop creates a new video timeline, including 
two default tracks: Layer 0 and Audio Track.
5 Click the Video menu in the Layer 0 track, and choose Add Media.
6 Navigate to the Lesson10 folder.
7 Shift-select the video and photo assets numbered 1–9, and click Open.
 Note: When you  
use the Add Media 
button with an 
unspecified canvas, 
Photoshop determines 
the project size based 
on the size of the first 
video file it finds—or, if 
you’re importing only 
images, based on the 
image size.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 273
Photoshop imports all nine of the assets you selected onto the same track, now 
named Video Group 1, in the Timeline panel. It displays still images with a purple 
background and video clips with a blue background. In the Layers panel, the assets 
appear as individual layers in the layer group named Video Group 1. You don’t need 
the Layer 0 layer, so you’ll delete it.
8 Select Layer 0 in the Layers panel, and click the Delete Layer button at the 
bottom of the panel. Click Yes if you’re prompted to confirm the deletion. 
Changing the duration of clips in the timeline
The clips are of very different lengths, meaning they’d play for different amounts of 
time. For this video, you want all the clips to be the same length, so you’ll shorten 
them all to 3 seconds. The length of a clip (its duration) is measured in seconds and 
frames: 03:00 is 3 seconds; 02:25 is 2 seconds and 25 frames.
1 Drag the Control Timeline Magnification slider to the right at the bottom of the 
Timeline panel to zoom in to the timeline. You want to be able to see a thumb-
nail of each clip, and enough detail in the time ruler that you can accurately 
change the duration of each clip.
2 Drag the right edge of the first clip (1_Family) to 03:00 on the time ruler. 
Photoshop displays the end point and the duration as you drag so that you can 
find the right stopping point.
3 Drag the right edge of the second clip (2_BoatRide) to a duration of 03:00.
Shortening a video clip doesn’t compress it; it removes part of the clip from the 
video. In this case, you want to use the first three seconds of each clip. If you wanted 
to use a different portion of a video clip, you might want to shorten the clip from 
each end.
 Note: You’re 
shortening each clip to 
the same length here, 
but you can have clips 
of varying lengths, 
depending on what’s 
appropriate for the 
project.

274 
lesson 10 
editing Video
4 Repeat step 3 for each of the remaining clips, so that each has a duration  
of 3 seconds.
The clips are now the right duration, but some of the images are the wrong size for 
the canvas. You’ll resize the first image before continuing.
5 Select the 1_Family layer in the Layers panel. The clip is also selected in the 
Timeline panel.
6 Click the triangle in the upper right corner of the 1_Family clip in the Timeline 
panel to open the Motion dialog box.
7 Choose Pan & Zoom from the menu, and make sure Resize To Fill Canvas is 
selected. Then click in an empty area of the Timeline panel to close the Motion 
dialog box. 
The image resizes to fit the canvas, which is what you wanted. However, you don’t 
actually want to pan and zoom. You’ll remove the effect.
8 Open the Motion dialog box from the 1_Family clip again, and choose No 
Motion from the menu. Click in an empty area of the Timeline panel to close the 
Motion dialog box. 
9 Choose File > Save. Click OK in the Photoshop Format Options dialog box.
animating text with keyframes
Keyframes let you control animation, effects, and other changes that occur over 
time. A keyframe marks the point in time where you specify a value, such as a 
position, size, or style. To create a change over time, you must have at least two 
keyframes: one for the state at the beginning of the change and one for the state 
at the end. Photoshop interpolates the values for the positions in between so that 
the change takes effect smoothly over the specified time. You’ll use keyframes to 
animate a movie title (Beach Day) from left to right over the opening image.
E Tip: The arrow 
on the left side of a 
clip (next to the clip’s 
thumbnail)reveals 
the attributes you 
can animate using 
keyframes. The arrow 
on the right side of a 
clip opens the Motion 
dialog box.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 275
1 Click the Video pop-up menu in the Video Group 1 track, and choose New 
Video Group. Photoshop adds Video Group 2 to the Timeline panel.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ), and then click on the left edge of the image, 
about halfway down from the top. Photoshop creates a new type layer, named 
Layer 1, in the Video Group 2 track.
3 In the options bar, select a sans serif font such as Myriad Pro, set the type size to 
600 pt, and select white for the type color. 
4 Type BEACH DAY. 
The text is large enough that it doesn’t all fit on the image. That’s okay; you’ll ani-
mate it to move across the image.
5 In the Layers panel, change the opacity for the BEACH DAY layer to 25%.
6 In the Timeline panel, drag the end point of the type layer to 03:00, so that it has 
the same duration as the 1_Family layer.
7 Click the arrow next to the thumbnail in the BEACH DAY clip to display the 
clip’s attributes. 
8 Make sure the playhead is at the beginning of the time ruler. 
9 Click the stopwatch icon next to the Transform property to set an initial 
keyframe for the layer. The keyframe appears as a yellow diamond in the 
timeline.

276 
lesson 10

10 Select the Move tool (
), and then use it to drag the type layer over the canvas 
so that it is centered vertically. Drag it to the right so that only the left edge of 
the letter “B” in the word “BEACH” is visible on the canvas.
11 Move the playhead to the last frame of the first clip (02:29f). 
12 Press the Shift key as you drag the type layer to the left over the canvas so that 
only the right edge of the “Y” in the word “DAY” is visible. Pressing the Shift key 
ensures the type remains level as you move it across.
Photoshop creates a new keyframe because you’ve changed the position.
13 Move the playhead across the first three seconds of the time ruler to preview the 
animation. The title moves across the image.
14 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Creating effects
One of the benefits of working with video files in Photoshop is that you can create 
effects using adjustment layers, styles, and simple transformations. 
adding adjustment layers to video clips
You’ve used adjustment layers with still images throughout this book. They work 
just as well on video clips. When you apply an adjustment layer in a video group, 
Photoshop applies it only to the following layer. 
1 Select the 3_DogAtBeach layer in the Layers panel.
E Tip: Photoshop 
displays the playhead’s 
location in the lower left 
corner of the Timeline 
panel.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 277
2 In the Timeline panel, move the playhead to the beginning of the 3_DogAtBeach 
layer so you can see the effect as you apply it.
3 In the Adjustments panel, click the Black & White button.
4 In the Properties panel, leave the default preset, and select Tint. The default tint 
color creates a sepia effect that works well for this clip. You can experiment with 
the sliders and the tint color to modify the black-and-white effect to your taste. 
5 Move the playhead across the 3_DogAtBeach clip in the Timeline panel to 
preview the effect.
animating a zoom effect
Even simple transformations become interesting effects when you animate them. 
You’ll use animation to zoom in on the 4_Dogs clip. 
1 Move the playhead to the beginning of the 4_Dogs clip in the Timeline panel 
(09:01). The image is so large that all that appears is a white portion of the sky.
2 Click the arrow in the 4_Dogs clip to display the Motion dialog box.
3 Choose Zoom from the pop-up menu, choose Zoom In from the Zoom menu, 
and make sure Resize To Fill Canvas is selected. Then click in an empty area of 
the Timeline panel to close the Motion dialog box.
4 Drag the playhead across the clip to preview the effect. You’ll enlarge the image 
in the last keyframe to make the zoom more dramatic. 
5 Click the arrow on the left side of the 4_Dogs clip to reveal the attributes for  
the clip.
 Note: If you had 
imported the video 
file using the Place 
command, so that it was 
not in a video group, 
you would need to 
create a clipping layer 
to limit the adjustment 
layer to a single layer.

6 Click the right arrow next to the Transform attribute to select the last keyframe, 
and choose Edit > Free Transform. Then enter 100% for the Width and Height 
in the options bar. Press Enter or Return to confirm the transformation.
7 Drag the playhead across the 4_Dogs clip in the time ruler to preview the 
animation again.
8 Choose File > Save.
animating style effects
You can apply layer styles to clips in the Timeline panel. First, you’ll resize the image 
to fit the canvas. Then you’ll apply a style and remove it, twice, so that it appears to 
be blinking on and off in the video.
1 Move the playhead to the beginning of the 6_Avery clip (15:01). The image is 
too large for the canvas.
2 Open the Motion dialog box for the clip, and choose Pan & Zoom from the 
pop-up menu. Make sure Resize To Fill Canvas is selected. Then click an empty 
area of the Timeline panel to close the Motion dialog box and resize the image.
3 Open the Motion dialog box again, and choose No Motion from the pop-up 
menu, since you don’t actually want to pan and zoom in this image. Click an 
empty area of the Timeline panel to close the dialog box. 
4 Choose Window > Styles to open the Styles panel. 
E Tip: You can move 
to the next keyframe by 
clicking the right arrow 
next to the attribute 
in the Timeline panel. 
Click the left arrow to 
move to the previous 
keyframe.

5  Click the arrow next to the thumbnail in the 6_Avery clip to show its attributes 
in the Timeline panel, and then click the stopwatch icon for the Style keyframe.
6 Move the playhead about a quarter of the way through the clip. Then, in the 
Styles panel, select the Negative Image style.
Photoshop adds a keyframe.
7 Move the playhead to the middle of the clip. Select the Default style to remove 
the effect. Photoshop adds another keyframe.
8 Move the playhead three-quarters of the way through the clip, and apply the 
Negative Image style again. Photoshop adds a fourth keyframe.
9 Move the playhead to the end of the clip (17:29), and select the Default style. 
Photoshop adds a final keyframe for the clip.

10 Move the playhead across the time ruler to preview the effect.
animating an image to create a motion effect
You’ll animate another transformation to create the appearance of motion. You 
want the image to begin with the diver’s legs and end with his hands. 
1 Move the playhead to the end of the 7_jumping clip (20:29). The diver is in the 
final position.
2 Display the attributes for the clip, and click the stopwatch icon for the Position 
attribute to add a keyframe. 
3 Move the playhead to the beginning of the clip (18:01). Press Shift while you 
move the image up so that the feet are near the bottom of the canvas.
Photoshop adds a keyframe.
4 Move the playhead across the time ruler to preview the animation.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
adding pan & zoom effects
You can easily add features similar to the pan and zoom effects used in documenta-
ries. You’ll add them to the sunsets to bring the video to a dramatic close.
1 Move the playhead to the beginning of the 8_Sunset clip.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 281
2 Open the Motion dialog box, and choose Pan from the pop-up menu. Make sure 
Resize To Fill Canvas is selected, and then select an empty area of the Timeline 
panel to close the Motion dialog box.
3 Move the playhead to the beginning of the 9_Sunset2 clip.
4 Open the Motion dialog box for the clip. Choose Pan & Zoom from the pop-up 
menu, choose Zoom Out from the Zoom menu, and make sure Resize To Fill 
Canvas is selected. Then select an empty area of the Timeline panel to close the 
Motion dialog box.
5 Move the playhead across the last two clips to preview the effects.
adding transitions
A transition moves a scene from one shot to the next. Simply drag and drop to add 
transitions to clips in Photoshop.
1 Click the Go To First Frame button ( ) in the upper left corner of the Timeline 
panel to return the playhead to the beginning of the time ruler.
2 Click the Transitions button (
) in the upper left corner of the Timeline panel. 
Select Cross Fade, and change the Duration value to .25 s (for a quarter of a 
second). 
3 Drag the Cross Fade transition between the 1_Family and 2_BoatRide clips. 
Photoshop adjusts the ends of the clips to apply the transition and adds a small 
white icon in the lower corner of the second clip.

282 
lesson 10 
editing Video
4 Drag Cross Fade transitions between each of the other clips.
5 Drag a Fade With Black transition onto the end of the final clip. 
6 To make the transition smoother, extend the Fade With Black transition by 
stretching its left side to about one-third the total length of the clip.
7 Choose File > Save.
adding audio
You can add a separate audio track to a video file in Photoshop. In fact, the 
Timeline panel includes an audio track by default. You’ll add an MP3 file to play as 
the soundtrack for this short video.
1 Click the note icon in the Audio Track at the bottom of the Timeline panel, and 
choose Add Audio from the pop-up menu.
2 Select the Beachsong.mp3 file from the Lesson10 folder, and click Open.
The audio file is added to the timeline, but it’s much longer than the video. You’ll 
use the Split At Playhead tool to shorten it. 
E Tip: You can also 
add an audio track by 
clicking the + sign at the 
far-right end of the track 
in the Timeline panel.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 283
3 Move the playhead to the end of the 9_Sunset2 clip (25:02), and then click the 
Split At Playhead tool. The audio file is clipped at that point, becoming two  
audio clips.
4 Select the second audio file segment, the one that begins after the end of the 
9_Sunset2 clip.
5 Press the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the selected audio clip.
Now the audio file is the same length as the video. You’ll add a fade so that it ends 
smoothly.
6 Click the small arrow at the right edge of the audio clip to open the Audio dialog 
box, and enter 5 seconds for Fade Out.
Muting unwanted audio
So far, you’ve previewed portions of the video by moving the playhead across the 
time ruler. Now you’ll preview the entire video using the Play button in the Timeline 
panel, and then mute any extraneous audio from the video clips. 
1 Click the Play button ( ) in the upper left corner of the Timeline panel to 
preview the video so far. 
It’s looking good, but there is some unwanted background noise from a few of the 
video clips. You’ll mute that extra sound. 
E Tip: To create a 
smoother preview, 
disable the audio 
playback button in 
the Timeline panel 
the first time you play 
the video. With audio 
playback disabled, 
Photoshop can create a 
more complete cache, 
resulting in a more 
accurate preview.

review answers
1 A keyframe marks the point in time where you specify a value, such as a position, size, 
or style. To create a change over time, you must have at least two keyframes: one for 
the state at the beginning of the change and one for the state at the end. To create an 
initial keyframe, click the stopwatch icon next to the attribute you want to animate for 
the layer. Photoshop creates additional keyframes each time you change the values of 
that attribute.
2 To add a transition, click the Transition icon in the upper left corner of the Timeline 
panel, and then drag a transition onto a clip.

lesson 11 
Painting with the mixer brush
about the Mixer Brush
In previous lessons, you’ve used brushes in Photoshop to perform various tasks. The 
Mixer Brush is unlike other brushes in that it lets you mix colors with each other. 
You can change the wetness of the brush and how it mixes the brush color with the 
color already on the canvas. 
Photoshop brushes have realistic bristles, so you can add textures that resemble 
those in paintings you might create in the physical world. While this is a great 
feature in general, it’s particularly useful when you’re using the Mixer Brush. In 
Photoshop CS6, you can also use an erodible tip to achieve the effects you might get 
with charcoal pencils and pastels in the physical world. Combining different bristle 
settings and brush tips with different wetness, paint-load, and paint-mixing settings 
gives you opportunities to create exactly the look you want. 
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll get acquainted with the Mixer Brush as well as the brush tip 
and bristle options available in Photoshop CS6. Start by taking a look at the final 
projects you’ll create.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.)
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 In Bridge, click Lessons in the Favorites panel. Double-click the Lesson11 folder 
in the Content panel.
5 Preview the Lesson11 end files. You’ll use the palette image to explore brush 
options and learn to mix colors. You’ll then apply what you’ve learned to 
transform the landscape image into a watercolor.
6 Double-click 11Palette_start.psd to open 
the file in Photoshop.
7 Choose File > Save As, and name the file 
11Palette_working.psd. Click OK if  
the Photoshop Format Options dialog 
box appears.
 Note: If you plan to 
do a lot of painting in 
Photoshop, consider 
using a tablet, such as a 
Wacom tablet, instead 
of a mouse. Photoshop 
can sense the way you 
hold and use the pen to 
change the brush width, 
strength, and angle on 
the fly.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 291
selecting brush settings
The image includes a palette and four tubes of color, which you’ll use to sample 
the colors you’re working with. You’ll change settings as you paint different colors, 
exploring brush tip settings and wetness options.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
), and zoom in to see the tubes of paint.
2 Select the Eyedropper tool ( ), and sample the red color from the red tube.  
The foreground color changes to red.
3 Select the Mixer Brush tool (
), hidden under the Brush tool (
). 
4 Choose Window > Brush to open the Brush panel. Select the first brush. 
The Brush panel contains brush presets and several options for customizing brushes. 
 Note: If you have 
OpenGL enabled, 
Photoshop displays a 
sampling ring so you 
can preview the color 
you’re picking up.

292 
lesson 11 
Painting with the mixer brush
experiment with wetness options and brushes
The effect of the brush is determined by the Wet, Load, and Mix fields in the options 
bar. Wet controls how much paint the brush picks up from the canvas. Load con-
trols how much paint the brush holds when you begin painting (as with a physical 
brush, it runs out of paint as you paint with it). Mix controls the ratio of paint from 
the canvas and paint from the brush. 
You can change these settings separately. However, it’s faster to select a standard 
combination from the pop-up menu. 
1 In the options bar, choose Dry from the pop-up menu of blending brush 
combinations.
When you select Dry, Wet is set to 0%, Load to 50%, and Mix is not applicable. 
With the Dry preset, you paint opaque color; you cannot mix colors on a dry 
canvas.
2 Paint in the area above the red tube. Solid red appears. As you continue painting 
without releasing the mouse, the paint eventually fades and runs out.
3 Sample the blue color from the blue tube of paint. You can use the Eyedropper 
tool or Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) to sample the color. If 
you use the Eyedropper tool, return to the Mixer Brush tool after you sample 
the color.
4 In the Brush panel, select the round fan-shaped brush. Choose Wet from the 
pop-up menu in the options bar. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 293
5 Paint above the blue tube. The paint mixes with the white background. 
6 Choose Dry from the menu in the options bar, and then paint again above  
the blue tube. A much darker, more opaque blue appears, and doesn’t mix  
with the white background.
The bristles from the fan brush you selected are much more apparent than the 
bristles you used originally. Changing bristle qualities makes a big difference in  
the texture you paint.
7 In the Brush panel, decrease the number of bristles to 40%. Paint a little more 
with the blue brush to see the change in texture. The bristles are much more 
obvious in the stroke.
E Tip: The Bristle 
Brush Preview shows 
you the direction of the 
bristles as you paint. To 
show or hide the Bristle 
Brush Preview, click the 
Toggle The Bristle Brush 
Preview button at the 
bottom of the Brush or 
Brush Presets panel. The 
Bristle Brush Preview 
is available only with 
OpenGL enabled.

294 
lesson 11 
Painting with the mixer brush
8 Sample the yellow color from the yellow paint tube. In the Brush panel, select 
the flat-point brush with fewer bristles (the one to the right of the fan brush). 
Choose Dry from the menu in the options bar, and then paint in the area over 
the yellow paint tube.
9 Choose Very Wet from the menu in the options bar, and then paint some more. 
Now the yellow mixes with the white background.
use an erodible tip
In Photoshop CS6, you can choose an erodible tip, so that the width of the brush 
changes as you paint. Erodible tips are represented in the Brush panel by pencil 
icons, because in the physical world, pencils and pastels have erodible tips. You’ll 
experiment with erodible point and flat tips.
1 Sample the green color from the green paint tube, and choose Dry, Heavy Load 
in the options bar. 
2 Select an Erodible Point brush. Change its Size to 9 px, and Softness to 100%. 
The Softness value determines how quickly the tip erodes. A higher value results  
in faster erosion.
3 Draw a zig-zag line above the green paint tube.
The line gets thicker as the tip erodes.
 Note: When you use 
Alt-click or Option-click 
to load paint from the 
canvas, the brush picks 
up any color variation  
in the sample area. If 
you want to sample 
only solid colors, select 
Load Solid Colors Only 
in the Current Brush 
Load menu in the 
options bar. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 295
4 Click Sharpen Tip in the Brush panel, and then draw a line next to the one you 
just drew.
The sharper tip draws a much narrower line.
5 Choose Erodible Triangle from the Shape menu in the Brush panel, and draw  
a zig-zag line with it.
You can choose from several erodible tips, depending on the effect you want.
Mixing colors
You’ve used wet and dry brushes, changed brush settings, and mixed the paint with 
the background color. Now, you’ll focus more on mixing colors with each other as 
you add paint to the painter’s palette. 
1 Zoom out just enough to see the full palette and the paint tubes.
2 Select the Paint mix layer in the Layers panel, so the color you paint won’t blend 
with the brown palette on the Background layer.
The Mixer Brush tool mixes colors only on the active layer unless you select Sample  
All Layers in the options bar.
 Note: Depending 
on the complexity of 
your project, you may 
need to be patient. 
Mixing colors can be 
a memory-intensive 
process.

296 
lesson 11 
Painting with the mixer brush
3 Sample the red color from the red paint tube. Select the round blunt brush  
in the Brush panel (the fifth brush). Then select Wet from the pop-up menu  
in the options bar, and paint in the top circle on the palette.
4 Click the Clean Brush After Every Stroke icon in the options bar to  
deselect it.
5 Sample the blue color from the blue paint tube, and then paint in the same 
circle, mixing the red with the blue to make purple. 
6 Paint in the next circle. You’re painting in purple because the paint stays on  
the brush until you clean it.
7 In the options bar, choose Clean Brush from the Current Brush Load pop-up 
menu. The preview changes to indicate transparency, meaning the brush has  
no paint loaded.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 297
To remove the paint load from a brush, you can choose Clean Brush in the options 
bar. To replace the paint load in a brush, sample a different color. 
If you want Photoshop to clean the brush after each stroke, select the Clean Brush 
icon in the options bar. To load the brush with the foreground color after each 
stroke, select the Load Brush icon in the options bar. By default, both of these 
options are selected.
8 Choose Load Brush from the Current Brush Load pop-up menu in the options 
bar to load the brush with blue paint. Paint blue in half of the next circle.  
9 Sample the yellow color from the yellow paint tube, and paint over the blue with 
a wet brush to mix the two colors.
10 Fill the last circle with yellow and red paint, mixing the two with a wet brush to 
create an orange color. 
11 Hide the Circles layer in the Layers panel to remove the outlines on the palette.
12 Choose File > Save.

lesson 11 
Painting with the mixer brush
Mixing colors with a photograph
Earlier, you mixed colors with a white background and with each other. Now, you’ll 
use a photograph as your canvas. You’ll add colors and mix them with each other 
and with the background colors to transform a photograph of a landscape into a 
watercolor. 
1 Choose File > Open. Double-click 
the 11Landscape_Start.jpg file in the 
Lesson11 folder to open it.
2 Choose File > Save As. Rename the  
file 11Landscape_working.jpg, and 
click Save. Click OK in the JPEG 
Options dialog box.
You’ll paint the sky first. Start by setting 
up the color and selecting the brush.
3 Click the Foreground color swatch in the Tools panel. Select a medium-light 
blue color (we chose R=185, G=204, B=228), and then click OK.
4 Select the Mixer Brush tool (
), if it isn’t already selected. Choose Dry from 
the pop-up menu in the options bar. Then select the Landscape brush from the 
Brush Presets panel. 
Presets are saved on your system, so they’re available when you work with any image.
5 Paint over the sky, moving in close to the trees. Because you’re using a dry 
brush, the paint isn’t mixing with the colors beneath it.
6 Select a darker blue color (we used R=103, G=151, B=212), and add darker color  
at the top of the sky, still using the dry brush.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 301
7 Select a light blue color again, and choose Very Wet, Heavy Mix from the 
pop-up menu in the options bar. Use this brush to scrub diagonally across the 
sky, blending the two colors in with the background color. Paint in close to the 
trees, and smooth out the entire sky.
Adding a darker color with a dry brush 
Blending colors with a wet brush
When you’re satisfied with the sky, move on to the grass and trees.
8 Select a light green (we used R=92, G=157, B=13). Choose Dry from the pop-up 
menu in the options bar. Then, paint along the top section of the grass to 
highlight it.
9 Sample a darker green from the grass itself. Choose Very Wet, Heavy Mix in the 
options bar. Then paint using diagonal strokes to blend the colors in the grass.

10 Sample a light green, and then use a dry brush to highlight the lighter areas of 
the trees and the small tree in the middle of the landscape. Then select a dark 
green (we used R=26, G=79, B=34), and choose Very Wet, Heavy Mix in the 
options bar. Paint with the wet brush to mix together the colors in the trees.
E Tip: Remember 
that you can Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-
click (Mac OS) to sample 
a color instead of using 
the Eyedropper tool. To 
sample only solid colors 
using the keyboard 
shortcut, choose Load

Mixing the colors
So far, so good. The background trees and the brown grasses are all that remain  
to be painted.
11 Select a bluer color for the background trees (we used R=65, G=91, B=116). 
Paint with a dry brush to add the blue at the top. Then choose Wet in the 
options bar, and paint to mix the blue into the trees.
12 Sample a brown color from the tall grasses, and then select Very Wet, Heavy 
Mix in the options bar. Paint along the top of the tall grass with up-and-down 
strokes for the look of a field. Across the back area, behind the small center tree, 
paint back and forth to create smooth strokes. 
Voilà! You’ve created a masterpiece with your paints and brushes, and there’s  
no mess to clean up.
E Tip: For different 
effects, paint in dif-
ferent directions. With 
the Mixer Brush tool, 
you can go wherever 
your artistic instincts 
lead you.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 303
Brush variations
You can go beyond the settings in these projects to explore numerous variations 
in brush tips and settings. In particular, you may want to play with Brush Pose and 
Shape Dynamics options.
Brush Pose settings change the tilt, rotation, and pressure of the brush. In the Brush 
panel, select Brush Pose from the list on the left. Move the Tilt X slider to tilt the 
brush from left to right. Move the Tilt Y slider to tilt the brush forward and back-
ward. Change the Rotation value to rotate the bristles. (Rotation is more obvious 
when using a flat fan-shaped brush, for example.) Change the Pressure setting to 
determine how much effect the brush has on the artwork.
Shape Dynamics settings affect the steadiness of the stroke. Move the sliders up to 
increase the variability in the stroke.
If you’re using a Wacom tablet, Photoshop recognizes the angle and pressure of 
the pen you’re using and applies them to the brush. You can use the pen to control 
such things as Size Jitter; choose Pen Pressure or Pen Tilt from the Control menu in 
the Shape Dynamics settings to determine how the value changes.
There are many more options—some subtle, some not so subtle—to create variety 
in brush effects. Which options are available depend on the brush tip shape you’ve 
selected. For more information about all the options, see Photoshop Help.

Traditional 3D artists spend hours, days, and weeks 
creating photo-realistic images. The 3D capabilities 
in Photoshop let you create sophisticated, precise 3D 
images easily—and you can change them easily, too.

lesson 12 Working with 3d images
Getting started
This lesson explores 3D features, which are available only if OpenGL 2.0 is sup-
ported by your video card and enabled on your computer. To learn about your 
video card, choose Edit > Preferences > Performance (Windows) or Photoshop > 
Preferences > Performance (Mac OS). Information about your video card is in the 
Graphics Processor Settings area of the dialog box. 
In this lesson, you’ll create a three-dimensional scene for a wine advertisement. 
First, you’ll view the finished scene. 
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.)
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Adobe Bridge.
4 In Bridge, click Lessons in the Favorites panel. Double-click the Lesson12 folder 
in the Content panel.
5 View the 12End.psd file in Bridge. A three-dimensional wine bottle, wine glass, 
and sale card sit atop a wooden box with 3D lettering. 
6 Double-click the 12End.mp4 file to view the movie in which light has been 
animated to simulate a sunrise. When you’re done viewing the movie, exit 
QuickTime.
7 Double-click the 12Start.psd file to open 
it in Photoshop. 
The file contains an image of a vineyard, a 
black background layer, and two additional 
layers.
Creating a 3D shape from a layer
Photoshop includes several 3D shape presets, representing geometric shapes and 
the shapes of everyday objects, such as a wine bottle or ring. When you create a 3D 
shape from a layer, Photoshop wraps the layer onto the 3D object preset. You can 
then rotate, reposition, and resize the 3D object—you can even light it from various 
angles with a number of colored lights.
 Note: If you’re using 
Windows XP, or if your 
video card does not 
support OpenGL 2.0, 
you won’t be able to 
work with 3D features  
in Photoshop.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 311
First, you’ll create the table for the wine bottle, glass, and card. To make the table, 
you’ll wrap a 3D cube with the layer that contains the image of wood.
1 Choose File > Save As. Navigate to the Lesson12 folder, and save the file 
as 12Working.psd. Click OK if the Photoshop Format Options dialog box 
appears.
2 In the Layers panel, make the Wood layer visible, and then select it.
3 Choose 3D > New Mesh From Layer > Mesh Preset > Cube Wrap.
4 Click Yes when asked whether you want to switch to the 3D workspace. 
The 3D workspace includes the 3D panel, the Layers panel, and the Properties 
panel. You’ll want to have all of these panels handy as you work with 3D objects. 
It also displays the ground plane, a grid that reflects the position of the ground 
relative to the 3D object, and the Secondary View window that lets you see the 3D 
object from a different perspective.

312 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
Photoshop wraps the wood image around a cube. You’re viewing the front of the 
cube. You’ll save the file now so you can easily return to this state after you’ve had a 
chance to experiment with the 3D tools. 
5 Choose File > Save to save the file at this point.
Manipulating 3D objects
The advantage to working with 3D objects is, obviously, that you can work with 
them in three dimensions. You can also return to a 3D layer at any time to change 
lighting, color, material, or position without having to re-create a lot of the art. 
Photoshop CS6 includes several basic tools that make it easy to rotate, resize, and 
position 3D objects. The 3D tools in the options bar manipulate the object itself. The 
Camera widget in the lower left corner of the application window manipulates the 
camera so you can view a 3D scene from different angles. 
You can use the 3D tools whenever a 3D layer is selected in the Layers panel. A 3D 
layer behaves like any other layer—you can apply layer styles, mask it, and so on. 
However, a 3D layer can be quite complex. 
Unlike a regular layer, a 3D layer contains one or more meshes. A mesh defines 
the 3D object. In the layer you just created, the mesh is the cube wrap shape. Each 
mesh, in turn, includes one or more materials—the appearance of a part or all of 
the mesh. Each material includes one or more maps, which are the components of 
the appearance. There are nine typical maps, and there can be only one of each kind; 
however, you can also use custom maps. Each map contains one texture—the image 
that defines what the maps and materials look like. The texture may be a simple 
bitmap graphic or a set of layers. The same texture might be used by many different 
maps and materials. In the layer you just created, the image of the wood composes 
the texture.
In addition to meshes, a 3D layer also includes one or more lights, which affect the 
appearance of 3D objects and remain in a fixed position as you spin or move the 
object. A 3D layer also includes cameras, which are saved views with the objects  
in a particular position. The shader creates the final appearance based on the  
materials, object properties, and renderer.
That may all sound complicated, but the most important thing to remember is that 
the 3D tools in the options bar move an object in 3D space and the Camera widget 
moves the cameras that view the object. 
1 In the Tools panel, select the Move tool (
). 
All the 3D capabilities are embedded into the Move tool, which recognizes when a 
3D layer is selected and enables the 3D tools.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 313
2 Select the Drag The 3D Object tool in the 3D Mode area of the options bar. 
3 Click on the wood, and drag it to move it from side to side or up and down.
4 Select the Roll The 3D Object tool in the options bar, and then click and drag  
the cube. 
5 Experiment with the other tools to see how they affect the object.
When you select a 3D object, Photoshop displays the colorful 3D Axis widget, with 
green, red, and blue representing different axes. Red represents the x axis, green 
represents the y axis, and blue represents the z axis. (Hint: Think of RGB color to 
remember the order.) If you hover the mouse over the center box until it turns 
yellow, you can click the box and drag to scale the object uniformly. Click an arrow 
to move the object along that axis; click the curved handle just before the arrow to 
rotate on that axis; and click the smaller handle to scale along that axis.
6 Rotate, scale, and move the cube using the widget.
E Tip: As you move 
the object, the 3D Axis 
widget shifts, too. For 
example, the x and y 
axis arrows may be 
available, while the z 
axis is pointing directly 
into the scene. The 
yellow center box may 
also be obscured by 
an axis.

lesson 12 Working with 3d images
7 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Camera widget in the lower 
left corner of the application window (it has two axes visible), and choose Top. 
Options in the Camera menu determine the angle from which you see the object. 
The camera angle changes, but the object itself does not. Don’t be fooled by its 
relationship to the background image; that image is not 3D, so Photoshop leaves it in 
place when it moves the camera for the 3D object. 
8 Choose other camera views to see how they affect the perspective.
9 When you’re done experimenting, choose File > Revert. You should see the 
front view of the wood cube again. 
adding 3D objects
The wooden cube is just one of five 3D elements in the scene. You’ll create all of the 
3D objects, and then merge them onto a single 3D layer, where you can work with 
them as a group. On one layer, they’ll share cameras and lights. 
Creating a 3D postcard
In Photoshop CS6, you can transform a 2D object into a 3D postcard that you can 
manipulate in perspective in a 3D space. It’s called a 3D postcard because it’s as if 
your image became a postcard you could turn over in your hand. 
You’ll use a 3D postcard to create the card that leans on the wine bottle.
1 Click the Layers tab to bring the Layers panel forward.
2 Make the Card layer visible, and select it.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 315
3 Choose 3D > New Mesh From Layer > Postcard.
The card doesn’t look much different, because you’re viewing the front of it. When 
you manipulate it later, it will be much more obvious that it’s a 3D postcard. 
Meanwhile, you can be sure it’s a 3D object because Photoshop switches to the 3D 
panel, displays the Secondary View window in the upper left corner, enables the 3D 
tools in the options bar, and displays the Camera widget in the lower left corner of 
the application window.
Creating a 3D mesh from a new layer
You used a 3D mesh preset to wrap the wood layer around a cube, but you can also 
use a mesh preset with a new, empty layer. You’ll do that to create a wine bottle. 
1 Bring the Layers panel forward, and make sure the Card layer is selected.
2 Click the Create A New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers panel.
A new layer, named Layer 1, appears above the Card layer. 

316 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
3 With Layer 1 selected, choose 3D > New Mesh From Layer > Mesh Preset > 
Wine Bottle.
A gray wine bottle shape appears in front of the card. Later, you’ll apply materials 
to the shape to make it look like a glass wine bottle.
4 In the Layers panel, rename the layer Bottle.
Importing a 3D file
In Photoshop CS6, you can open and work with 3D files exported from various 
applications, such as Collada, 3DS, KMZ (Google Earth) or U3D. You can also work 
with files saved in Collada format, a file interchange format supported by Autodesk, 
for example. When you add a 3D file as a 3D layer, it includes the 3D model and a 
transparent background. The layer uses the dimensions of the existing file, but you 
can resize it.
You’ll import a 3D wine glass that was created in another application.
1 Choose 3D > New 3D Layer From File.
2 Navigate to the Lesson12/Assets folder, and double-click the WineGlass.obj file.
The wine glass shape appears in front of the bottle, centered in the document 
window. 
3 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 317
Creating 3D text
Even text can be three-dimensional. When you’ve created 3D text, you can rotate 
it, scale it, move it, apply materials to it, change its lighting (and the accompanying 
shadows), and extrude it. You’ll create 3D text for the front of the wooden table.
1 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ) in the Tools panel.
2 Drag a marquee across the middle of the window.
3 In the options bar, select a serif font such as Minion Pro, Bold for the font style, 
and 72 pt for the font size. 
4 Type HI-WHEEL, in all capital letters.
You’ve created text, but it’s not three-dimensional yet. You’ll convert it now.
5 Click the Update 3D Associated With This Text button in the options bar.
Now the text is 3D, and Photoshop displays its ground plane and the rest of the 3D 
work environment.

318 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
Merging 3D layers to share 
the same 3D space
You can include multiple 3D meshes in the same 3D layer. Meshes in the same  
layer can share lighting effects and be rotated in the same 3D space (also called  
the scene), creating a more realistic 3D effect. 
You’ll merge the 3D layers you created so that all the 3D objects are part of the  
same scene.
1 Bring the Layers panel forward.
2 Press Shift while you select the HI-WHEEL, WineGlass, Bottle, Card, and Wood 
layers. 
All five 3D layers are selected. Now you’ll merge them. Be sure to press Shift while 
you merge them in order to retain their alignment.
3 Hold down the Shift key while you choose 3D > Merge 3D Layers. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 319
Photoshop merges the layers into one layer, 
named Wood. Because you pressed Shift 
while you merged the layers, the objects’ 
positions are unchanged.
4 Choose File > Save to save your work  
so far.
Positioning objects in a scene
The objects are all there, but it’s not a very attractive arrangement. You’ll use on-
canvas widgets and the Properties panel to resize and reposition each of the 3D 
objects to compose an appealing scene.
Changing the camera view
The Secondary View window can show you the scene from different perspectives. 
You’ll use it to see the objects, and then change the camera view to get a better look 
at them as you reposition them.
1 Pan to see the objects below the wooden 
block in the Secondary View window in the 
upper left corner of the document window. 
The current camera view for the Secondary 
View window is from the top. The objects you 
created are in front of the wooden box. 
E Tip: If your merged 
layers don’t look like  
this image, you 
probably released the 
Shift key before the 
layers were merged. 
Choose Edit > Undo 
Merge Layers,  
and try again. 
 Note: The camera 
view in the Secondary 
View window is 
independent of the 
camera view for 
the scene. You can 
change the view 
in the Secondary 
View window to 
see the scene from 
different angles 
without changing 
its appearance in 
Photoshop.

320 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
2 Click the Select View/Camera button at the top of the Secondary View window, 
and choose Left. 
Now you can see the objects clearly. You’ll use this camera view for the scene.
3 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Camera widget in the 
lower left corner of the document window, and choose Left.
Moving objects with the 3D axis widget
The wine glass, wine bottle, and card need to sit atop the wooden table, not beside 
it. You can manipulate individual 3D objects within a 3D layer by selecting their 
folders in the 3D panel. You’ll use the 3D Axis widget to move the objects on top of 
the table.
1 Bring the 3D panel forward in the Layers panel group.
2 Press the Shift key as you select the Card_Layer, Bottle_Layer, and WineGlass_
Layer folders. 
3 Hover the cursor over the tip of the green arrow until you see the Move On Y 
Axis tool tip.
E Tip: We’ve included 
a video of these steps 
in the Lesson12/Video 
folder. Double-click the 
PositioningObjects.mp4 
file to follow along.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 321
4 Click the tip of the green arrow, and drag the objects up until the bottom of the 
wine bottle is level with the top of the wooden cube. 
5 Click the tip of the blue arrow, and drag the objects to the left until they are 
centered on the cube. You can use the green arrow to drag the objects up 
or down again. The positioning doesn’t have to be perfect; you’ll have the 
opportunity to make adjustments later. 
You’ve moved the card, bottle, and glass. Now you’ll move the text, which is cur-
rently a small black square off to the side of the box.
6 In the 3D panel, expand the HI-WHEEL_Layer folder, and select the 
HI-WHEEL text. 
7 Drag the HI-WHEEL text so that it is just in front of the cube, using the green 
and blue arrows in the 3D Axis widget. 
E Tip: You can change 
the size of the 3D Axis 
widget. Press Shift as 
you hover the cursor 
over the yellow scaling 
cube. Then click and 
drag to make the 3D 
Axis widget smaller or 
larger. 

322 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
Remember that the camera view is from the left. To move the text in front of the 
box, it needs to appear to be to the right of the box in this view.
8 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Camera widget, and 
choose Default. 
The camera angle changes to display the scene from the front. 
9 In the 3D panel, select Environment.
10 Select the Drag The 3D Object tool in the options bar, and then drag the entire 
set of objects toward the lower right area of the canvas, as in the image below.
using the Properties panel to position 3D objects
You’ve done some good work, but the objects aren’t in their final positions yet. 
You’ll change coordinates in the Properties panel to move them into place.
1 Select Scene in the 3D panel. 
Changes you make while Scene is selected affect the entire 3D scene.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 323
2 In the Properties panel, click the Coordinates button to change the options 
available.
3 Type -30 in the Y Rotation box. 
The entire 3D scene rotates 30 degrees against the background. Next, you’ll scale 
the wine glass and align it with the bottle.
4 In the 3D panel, select objMesh, inside the WineGlass_Layer folder.
5 In the Properties panel, enter 55% for the X Scale, Y Scale, and Z Scale values.
6 In the 3D panel, Shift-select the Bottle_Layer and WineGlass_Layer folders.
E Tip: Press V to 
switch between panes 
in the Properties panel. 

324 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
7 Click the Align Bottom Edges button in the Photoshop options bar to align the 
bottom edges of the two objects (so that they both rest on the cube).
The wine glass is more proportionate with the bottle, and aligned with it. Now 
you’ll move it to the right of the bottle, and then move the bottle to the left side of 
the box.
8 Select ObjMesh in the WineGlass_Layer folder in the 3D panel. Then enter the 
following values in the Position boxes in the Properties panel: X: 217.1,  
Y: 274.2, and Z: 81.8. 
9 Select the Wine Bottle mesh in the Bottle_Layer folder in the 3D panel.  
Then enter the following values in the Position boxes in the Properties panel:  
X: 102.4, Y: 388.8, and Z: 4.8.
E Tip: If you’d rather, 
you can position the 
wine glass and the 
bottle using the 3D  
Axis widget.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 325
10 In the Properties panel, enter 120% for the X Scale, Y Scale, and Z Scale. 
11 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
scaling and rotating objects with widgets 
The wine glass and bottle are in position now, but the text and card are still out of 
place. You’ll use the 3D Axis widget to scale and position them appropriately.
1 In the 3D panel, expand the HI-WHEEL_Layer folder, and select the  
HI-WHEEL text.
2 Select the Rotate The 3D Object tool in the options bar.
3 Use the red arrow on the 3D Axis widget to pull the text back and forth until it’s 
centered on the front of the box. Use the green and blue arrows to move the text 
up and down, and forward and backward, as needed. 
4 Hover the mouse over the center of the 3D Axis widget until the center cube 
turns yellow. Then drag the widget to scale the text so that it fits the width of the 
cube (about 135% of its original size, as reported in the hint text as you drag). 
The text is in place. Now you’ll resize and position the card.
 Note: If you prefer to 
enter coordinates, type 
57% for the X Scale, 
Y Scale, and Z Scale 
values. The starting 
scale is about 42%; 57 is 
roughly 135% of 42.

326 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
5 In the 3D panel, close the HI-WHEEL folder, and expand the Card_Layer folder. 
6 Select Card Mesh in the 3D panel, and then use the 3D Axis widget to scale it to 
about 25% of its original size. 
7 Drag the tip of the blue arrow on the 3D Axis widget to move the card forward 
along the Z axis until the front of the card and the front of the cube are even.
8 Drag the tip of the green arrow to pull the card down so it rests on the cube.
9 Use the blue curved handle to rotate the top of the card back so that it appears to 
lean against the bottle. Make any further adjustments to the card’s position using 
the blue, green, and red arrows, as necessary. 
Everything’s in position! 
9 Choose File > Save to save your work.
applying materials to 3D objects
One of the benefits of working with 3D objects is that you can quickly change the 
appearance of the objects. You’ll apply materials to the text to make it stand out. 
Then you’ll make the bottle and wine glass look much more realistic.
Changing the appearance of 3D text
You’ll change the shape of the text, extrude it, and then apply materials to each 
surface of the 3D text.
1 In the 3D panel, expand the HI-WHEEL_Layer folder, and select the  
HI-WHEEL text. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 327
2 Press V to change panes in the Properties panel, cycling through the Mesh, 
Deform, Cap, and Coordinates panels. The on-canvas widgets change for 
different panes. 
3 Click the Deform button in the Properties panel to see the Deform properties. 
4 In the Properties panel, choose Bevel from the Shape Preset menu. (Bevel is the 
middle option in the top row.)
5 Click the center of the on-canvas Deform widget and drag until the extrusion 
depth is approximately 23. 
6 Press V to display the Cap properties in the Properties panel. 
7 Drag the on-canvas widget upwards until the inflation strength is 4.75.
The bevel looks great. Now you’ll apply a material to make the text shiny.
E Tip: When the 
Deform properties are 
shown, the on-canvas 
widget lets you extrude, 
taper, bend, or twist the 
selected object mesh.

328 
lesson 12 Working with 3d images
8 In the 3D panel, Shift-select the five material components of the HI-WHEEL 
text: HI-WHEEL Front Inflation Material, HI-WHEEL Front Bevel Material, 
HI-WHEEL Extrusion Material, HI-WHEEL Back Bevel Material, and 
HI-WHEEL Back Inflation Material.
9  In the Properties panel, open the Materials picker. 
10  Choose Default (For Ray Tracer) from the settings menu. Click OK when you’re 
prompted to replace the materials, and click Don’t Save if you’re prompted to 
save the current materials.

A different set of materials appears in the Materials picker.
11 In the Materials picker, select Metal Gold, the middle option in the fourth row.
Every aspect of the 3D text is now gold. You’ll use the same process to apply mate-
rials to the bottle and wine glass.
12 Hide the contents of the HI-WHEEL_Layer folder in the 3D panel.
applying materials to objects
You’ll use similar techniques to apply materials to the wine bottle’s cork and glass, 
and then apply an imported label. Next, you’ll make the wine glass look much more 
realistic than it does now.
1 Select the Cork_Material component in the Bottle_Layer folder in the 3D panel.
This material applies to only the cork area of the bottle.
2 In the Properties panel, open the Materials picker, and then select Metal Brass 
(Solid) from the middle of the third row. 
The bottle appears to have a foil wrapper around its cork.
3 Select the Glass_Material component in the 3D panel, and then select Gemstone

lesson 12 Working with 3d images
Lighting a 3D scene
You can adjust the default light for a scene, and add new lights. How you adjust the 
lights determines the shadows, the highlights, and the mood of the scene.
1 In the 3D panel, select Infinite Light 1, the last item in the panel.
By default, Photoshop creates one infinite light when you create a 3D scene. When 
you select the light, an on-canvas widget appears to help you direct the light. Move 
the large knob to make sweeping changes; adjust the small knob for more precise 
lighting shifts.
2 Use the small knob to position the light in the upper left corner (at about the 
11:00 position on a clock), so that there’s a tall highlight along the center of the 
neck of the bottle.
3 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the light itself (the white 
round icon) to open the Infinite Light 1 panel. Then change the color to a faint 
gold color (we used R=251, G=242, B=203), and change the Intensity to 75%.
 Note: The size 
of the light widget 
depends on the screen 
magnification. Yours 
might be larger or 
smaller than the one 
shown here.
 Note: You can make 
changes in the Infinite 
Light 1 panel or in the 
Properties panel.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 333
4 Click the Add New Light To Scene button at the bottom of the 3D panel, and 
choose New Infinite Light. 
5 With Infinite Light 2 selected, change the color to a similar light gold color in 
the Properties panel. Then change the Intensity value to 30%.
6 With Infinite Light 2 still selected in the 3D panel, move the knob on the 
on-canvas widget to position the light at about the 1:00 position on the clock, so 
that there’s a nice highlight on the edge of the bottle. 
7 Click the Add New Light To Scene button at the bottom of the 3D panel, and 
choose New Point Light. 
8 Select Point Light 1 in the 3D panel, and then change its Intensity to 30% in the 
Properties panel.

lesson 12 Working with 3d images
rendering a 3D scene
As you build a scene in Photoshop, you can get a pretty good idea of what it will 
look like. But it’s only when you render it that you know how realistic the final 
project will look. You can render small areas of the scene at any time, but wait until 
you think you’re close to done to render the entire scene. Rendering is a time-
consuming process, and once you’ve rendered the scene, every change you makes 
triggers re-rendering.
You can render the scene now, or, if you’re planning to do the Extra Credit project, 
wait and render the animated scene.
1 Choose File > Save As, and save the file as 12_render.psd. Click OK if the 
Photoshop Format Options dialog box appears. 
Saving a separate file for rendering ensures that you’ll be able to make changes to 
the original more quickly.
2 In the 3D panel, select Scene to ensure that the entire scene is selected.
3 Click the Render button at the bottom of the Properties panel. 
Photoshop renders the file. Depending on your system, this can take anywhere 
from a few minutes to half an hour or more. 
E Tip: You can 
change the number 
of passes Photoshop 
makes when it renders 
the scene. Choose 
Edit > Preferences > 
3D (Windows) 
or Photoshop > 
Preferences > 3D  
(Mac OS) and then 
change the High Quality 
Threshold value in the 
Ray Tracer area.
Depending  
on your system, 
this may take a 
while.
E Tip: If you need to 
interrupt the rendering, 
or believe that the 
quality is sufficient, click 
anywhere on the image 
to stop the rendering 
process.

review answers
1 A 3D layer behaves like any other layer—you can apply layer styles, mask it, and so on. 
However, unlike a regular layer, a 3D layer also contains one or more meshes, which 
define 3D objects. You can work with meshes and the materials, maps, and textures 
they contain. You can also adjust the lighting for a 3D layer.
2 To change the camera view, you can move the Camera widget, or right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the widget to choose a camera view preset.
3 To apply materials, select the material component in the 3D panel, and then select 
materials and settings in the Properties panel. 
4 In the 3D Axis widget, the red arrow represents the X axis; the green arrow represents 
the Y axis, and the blue arrow represents the Z axis. 
5 To render a 3D scene, select Scene in the 3D panel, and then click the Render button at 
the bottom of the Properties panel.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: 
• Slice an image in Photoshop.
• Distinguish between user slices and auto slices.
• Link user slices to other HTML pages or locations. 
• Optimize images for the web and make good compression  
choices. 
• Export large, high-resolution files that tile for zooming and 
panning.
• Showcase your images in a media gallery. 
This lesson will take about an hour to complete. Copy the Lesson13 folder 
onto your hard drive if you have not already done so. As you work on this 
lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need to restore the start files, 
copy them again from the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD.

Web users expect to click linked graphics to jump  
to another site or page, and to activate built-in  
animations. You can prepare a file for the web in 
Photoshop by adding slices to link to other pages  
or sites.

lesson 13 
Preparing Files for the Web
Getting started
For this lesson, you will need to use a web browser application such as Firefox, 
Netscape, Internet Explorer, or Safari. You do not need to connect to the Internet.
You’ll fine-tune graphics for the home page of a Spanish art museum’s website. 
You’ll add hypertext links to the topics, so that website visitors can jump to other 
prebuilt pages on the site. 
First, you’ll explore the final HTML page that you will create from a single 
Photoshop file.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.)
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
3 Choose File > Browse In Bridge.
4 In Bridge, click Lessons in the Favorites panel. Double-click the Lesson13 folder 
in the Content panel, double-click the 13End folder, and finally, double-click the 
Site folder.
The Site folder contains the contents of the website that you’ll be working with.
5 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the home.html file, and 
choose Open With from the context menu. Choose a web browser to open the 
HTML file.
6 Move the pointer over the topics on the left side of the web page and over 
the images. When the pointer hovers over a link, it changes from an arrow  
to a pointing hand.

8 To return to the home page, close the Zoomify tab or window. 
9 Click the image of the boy with the lightbulb to get a closer look at it in its own 
window. Close its browser window when you have finished.
10 On the home page, click the topics on the left side to jump to their linked pages. 
To return to the home page, click the “Museo Arte” text just below the logo in 
the upper left corner of the window. 
11 When you have finished viewing the web page, quit the web browser, and return 
to Bridge.
12 In Bridge, click the Lesson13 folder in the breadcrumbs (the navigation path) 
at the top of the window to display the Lesson13 folder contents. Double-click 
the 13Start folder in the Content panel, and then double-click the 13Start.psd 
thumbnail to open the file in Photoshop.
13 Choose File > Save As, and rename the file 13Working.psd. Click OK in the 
Photoshop Format Options dialog box. Saving a working copy preserves the 
original start file in case you need to return to it later.
In the preceding steps, you used two different types of links: slices (the topics on  
the left side of the page) and images (the boy and the angel).
Slices are rectangular areas in an image that you define based on layers, guides,  
or precise selections in the image, or by using the Slice tool. When you define slices 
in an image, Photoshop creates an HTML table or Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)  
layers to contain and align the slices. You can generate and preview an HTML file 
that contains the sliced image along with the table or cascading style sheet. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 343
You can also add hypertext links to images. A website visitor can then click the 
image to open a linked page. Unlike slices, which are always rectangular, images 
can be any shape.
Creating slices
When you define a rectangular area in an image as a slice, Photoshop creates an 
HTML table to contain and align the slice. Once you create slices, you can turn 
them into buttons, and then program those buttons to make the web page work. 
Any new slice you create within an image (a user slice) automatically creates other 
slices (auto slices) that cover the entire area of the image outside the user slice.
selecting slices and setting slice options
You’ll start by selecting an existing slice in the start file. We created the first slice 
for you.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Slice Select tool (
), hidden under the Crop  
tool ( ).
When you select the Slice or Slice Select tool, Photoshop displays the slices, with 
their slice numbers, on the image.
The slice numbered 01 includes the upper left corner of the image; it also has a 
small icon, or badge, that resembles a tiny mountain. The blue color means that  
the slice is a user slice—a slice we created in the start file. 
Also notice the gray slices—02 to the right, and 03 just below slice 01. The gray 
color indicates that these are auto slices, automatically created by making a user 
slice. The symbol indicates that the slice contains image content. See “About slice 
symbols” for a description. 
2 In the upper left corner of the image, click the slice numbered 01 with the  
small blue rectangle. A gold bounding box appears, indicating that the slice  
is selected. 

344 
lesson 13 
Preparing Files for the Web
about slice symbols
The blue and gray slice symbols, or badges, in the Photoshop image window and 
Save For Web And Devices dialog box can be useful reminders if you take the time 
to learn how to read them. Each slice can contain as many badges as are appropri-
ate. These badges indicate the following:
The number of the slice. Numbers run sequentially from left to right and top  
to bottom of the image.
The slice contains image content.
The slice contains no image content.
The slice is layer-based; that is, it was created from a layer.
The slice is linked to other slices (for optimization purposes).
3 Using the Slice Select tool, double-click slice 01. The Slice Options dialog box 
appears. By default, Photoshop names each slice based on the filename and the 
slice number—in this case, 13Start_01. 
Slices aren’t particularly useful until you set options for them. Slice options include 
the slice name and the URL that opens when the user clicks the slice. 
4 In the Slice Options dialog box, name the slice Logo. For URL, type #. The 
pound sign (#) lets you preview a button’s functionality without programming 
an actual link. It’s very helpful in the early stages of website design, when you 
want to see how a button will look and behave.
 Note: You can set 
options for an auto 
slice, but doing so 
automatically promotes 
the auto slice to a  
user slice.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 345
5 Click OK to apply the changes.
Creating navigation buttons
Now you’ll slice the navigation buttons on the left side of the page. You could select 
one button at a time and add navigation properties to it. But you can do the same 
thing a faster way.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Slice tool (
), or press Shift+C. (The Crop tool, 
Perspective Crop tool, Slice tool, and Slice Select tool share the C key as their 
keyboard shortcut. To change which of the four tools is selected, press Shift+C.)
Notice the guides above and below the words on the left side of the image. 
2 Using the guides on the left side of the image, drag the Slice tool diagonally from 
the upper left corner above the first line of text, to the bottom guide below the 
last line of text, so that all five lines are enclosed. 
A blue rectangle, similar to the one for slice 01, appears in the upper left corner  
of the slice you just created, numbered slice 05. The blue color tells you that this  
is a user slice, not an auto slice. The gold bounding box indicates the bounds of the 
slice and that it’s selected.
The original gray rectangle for auto slice 03 remains unchanged, but the area 
included in slice 03 is smaller, covering only a small rectangle above the text. 
Another auto slice, numbered 07, appears below the slice you created.

3 With the Slice tool still selected, press Shift+C to toggle to the Slice Select  
tool (
). The options bar above the image window changes to include  
a series of alignment buttons.
Now you’ll slice your selection into five separate buttons.
4 Click the Divide button in the options bar. 
5 In the Divide Slice dialog box, select Divide Horizontally Into, and type  
5 for Slices Down, Evenly Spaced. Click OK. 
You’ll name each slice and add a corresponding link.
6 Using the Slice Select tool, double-click the top slice (containing the words 
“About Museo Arte”).
7 In the Slice Options dialog box, name the slice About; type about.html for URL; 
and type _self for Target. (Be sure to include the underscore before the letter s.) 
Click OK.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 347
The Target option controls how a linked file opens when the link is clicked.  
The _self option displays the linked file in the same frame as the original file.
8 Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the remaining slices in turn, starting from the second 
slice, as follows: 
• Name the second slice Tour; type tour.html for URL; and type _self  
for Target.
• Name the third slice Exhibits; type exhibits.html for URL; and type _self 
for Target.
• Name the fourth slice Members; type members.html for URL; and type 
_self for Target.
• Name the fifth slice Contact; type contact.html for URL; and type _self  
for Target.

about creating slices
Here are other methods for creating slices that you can try on your own:
• 
You can create No Image slices, and then add text or HTML source code to them. 
No Image slices can have a background color and are saved as part of the HTML 
file. The primary advantage of using No Image slices for text is that the text can 
be edited in any HTML editor, saving you the trouble of having to go back to 
Photoshop to edit it. However, if the text grows too large for the slice, it will 
break the HTML table and introduce unwanted gaps.
• 
If you use custom guides in your design work, you can instantly divide up an 
entire image into slices with the Slices From Guides button on the options bar. 
Use this technique with caution, however, because it discards any previously 
created slices and any options associated with those slices. Also, it creates only 
user slices, and you may not need that many of them.
• 
When you want to create identically sized, evenly spaced, and aligned slices, try 
creating a single user slice that precisely encloses the entire area. Then, use the 
Divide button on the Slice Select options bar to divide the original slice into as 
many vertical or horizontal rows of slices as you need.
• 
If you want to unlink a layer-based slice from its layer, you can convert it  
to a user slice. Select it with the Slice Select tool, and then click Promote in the 
options bar.
 Note: Type the 
HTML filenames in the 
URL box exactly as 
shown, to match the 
names of the existing 
pages to which you will 
link the buttons. 
E Tip: If you find the 
indicators for the auto 
slices distracting, select 
the Slice Select tool 
and then click the Hide 
Auto Slices button in 
the options bar. You can 
also hide the guides  
by choosing View > 
Show > Guides, because 
you won’t need them 
again in this lesson. 

348 
lesson 13 
Preparing Files for the Web
Creating slices based on layers
In addition to using the Slice tool, you can create slices based on layers. The  
advantage of using layers for slices is that Photoshop creates the slice based on  
the dimensions of the layer and includes all its pixel data. When you edit the layer, 
move it, or apply a layer effect to it, the layer-based slice adjusts to encompass the 
new pixels. 
1 In the Layers panel, select the New Wing layer. 
If you can’t see all of the contents of the Layers 
panel, drag the panel from its dock, and expand 
it by dragging the lower right corner downwards.
2 Choose Layer > New Layer Based Slice. In the 
image window, a slice numbered 04, with a 
blue badge, appears over the image announcing 
the new wing. It is numbered according to its 
position in the slices, starting from the top left 
corner of the image. 
3 Using the Slice Select tool (
), double-click the slice, and name it New Wing. 
For URL, type newwing.html. Type _blank for Target. The _blank Target 
option opens the linked page in a new instance of the web browser. Click OK.
Be sure to enter these options exactly as indicated, to match the pages you’ll be 
linking the slices to.
Now you’ll create slices for the Image 1 and Image 2 layers.
4 Repeat steps 1–3 for the remaining images, as follows: 
•
Create a slice from the Image 1 layer. Name it Image 1; for URL, type 
image1.html; and type _blank for Target. Click OK.
•
Create a slice from the Image 2 layer. Name it Card; type card.html for 
URL, and type _blank for Target. Click OK.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 349
You may have noticed that the dialog box contains more options than the three you 
specified for these slices. For more information on how to use these options, see 
Photoshop Help.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work so far. 
exporting htML and images
You’re ready to make your final slices, define your links, and export your file so that 
Photoshop creates an HTML page that will display all of your slices as one unit. 
It’s important to keep web graphics as small (in file size) as possible, so that web 
pages open quickly. Photoshop has built-in tools to help you gauge how small each 
exported slice can be without compromising image quality. A good rule of thumb 
is to use JPEG compression for photographic, continuous-tone images and GIF 
compression for broad areas of color—in the case of this lesson’s site, all of the areas 
around the three main art images on the page.
You’ll use the Save For Web dialog box to compare settings and compression 
options for different image formats. 
1 Choose File > Save For Web.
2 Select the 2-Up tab at the top of the Save For Web dialog box.

3 Use the Hand tool (
) in the dialog box to move the image within the window 
so that you can see the portrait of the boy.
4 Choose the Slice Select tool (
) in the dialog box, and select slice 17 (the 
portrait of the boy) from the slices in the image on the left. Note the file size 
displayed beneath the image.
5 On the right side of the dialog box, choose JPEG Medium from the Preset 
pop-up menu. Notice the file size displayed beneath the image; the file size 
changes dramatically when you choose JPEG Medium.
Now you’ll look at a GIF setting for the same slice in the image on the right.
6 With the Slice Select tool, select slice 17 in the image on the right. On the right 
side of the dialog box, choose GIF 32 No Dither from the Preset pop-up menu.
Notice that the color area in the portrait in the lower image looks flatter and more 
posterized, but the image size is roughly the same.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 351
Based on what you’ve just learned, you will choose which compression to assign  
to all of the slices on this page. 
7 Select the Optimized tab at the top of the dialog box.
8 With the Slice Select tool, Shift-click to select the images of the boy, the angel, 
and the new wing announcement in the preview window. From the Preset 
menu, choose JPEG Medium. 
9 Shift-click to select all of the remaining slices in the preview window, and then 
choose GIF 64 Dithered from the Preset menu.

15 When you have finished exploring the file, close your browser.
Optimizing images for the web
Optimizing is the process of selecting format, resolution, and quality settings to 
make an image efficient, visually appealing, and useful for web browser pages. 
Simply put, it’s balancing file size against good looks. No single collection of settings 
can maximize the efficiency of every kind of image file; optimizing requires human 
judgment and a good eye.
Compression options vary according to the file format used to save the image. 
JPEG and GIF are the two most common formats. The JPEG format is designed to 
preserve the broad color range and subtle brightness variations of continuous-tone 
images such as photographs. It can represent images using millions of colors. The 
GIF format is effective at compressing solid-color images and images with areas of 
repetitive color, such as line art, logos, and illustrations with type. It uses a panel of 
256 colors to represent the image and supports background transparency. 
Photoshop offers a range of controls for compressing image file size while optimiz-
ing the onscreen quality. Typically, you optimize images before saving them in an 
HTML file. Use the Save For Web dialog box to compare the original image to one 
or more compressed alternatives, adjusting settings as you compare. For more on 
optimizing GIF and JPEG images, see Photoshop Help.

using the Zoomify feature
With the Zoomify feature, you can publish high-resolution images on the web that 
viewers can pan and zoom to see more detail. The basic-size image downloads in 
the same time as an equivalent-size JPEG file. Photoshop exports the JPEG files and 
HTML file that you can upload to your website. The Zoomify capabilities work with 
any web browser.
1 In Bridge, click the 13Start folder in the breadcrumbs at the top of the window. 
Then, double-click the card.jpg file to open it in Photoshop.
The card is a large bitmap image that you’ll export to HTML using the Zoomify 
feature. You’ll convert the angel image into a file that will be linked to one of the 
links that you’ve just created in the home page.
2 Choose File > Export > Zoomify. 
3 In the Zoomify Export dialog box, click Folder, select the Lesson13/13Start/
Museo folder, and click OK or Choose. For Base Name, type Card. Set the 
quality to 12; set the Width to 800, and set the Height to 600 for the base  
image in the viewer’s browser. Make sure that the Open In Web Browser  
option is selected. 
4 Click OK to export the HTML file and images. Zoomify opens them in your  
web browser. 
5 Use the controls in the Zoomify window to zoom in and out of the angel image.

6 When you have finished, close the browser.
Creating a web gallery
Using Bridge, you can easily showcase your images in an online gallery, so that visi-
tors can view individual images or a slide show of your work. You’ll create a media 
gallery linked to the exhibits.html file in the museum website. 
1 In Bridge, double-click the Watercolors folder (in the Lesson13/13Start folder).
You’ll create a slide show from the images in the Watercolors folder.
2 Select the first image, and then Shift-select the last, so that all the images are 
selected. Remember that you can use the Thumbnails slider at the bottom of 
the Bridge window to reduce the size of the thumbnails, so that more fit in the 
Content panel at a time.

review answers
1 Slices are rectangular areas of an image that you define for individual web 
optimization. You can add animated GIFs, URL links, and rollovers to slices. You  
can create image slices with the Slice tool or by converting layers into slices using the 
Layer menu. 
2 Image optimization is the process of choosing file format, resolution, and quality 
settings for an image to keep it small, useful, and visually appealing when published  
to the web. Continuous-tone images are typically optimized in JPEG format; solid-
color images or those with repetitive color areas are typically optimized as GIF.  
To optimize images, choose File > Save For Web. 
3 To create a slide show for use on the web, use Bridge. Select the files you want 
to include, and then select Web Gallery in the Output panel in Bridge. Set the

To produce consistent color, you define the color 
space in which to edit and display RGB images, and 
the color space in which to edit, display, and print 
CMYK images. This helps ensure a close  
match between onscreen and printed colors.

lesson 14 
Producing and Printing Consistent Color
about color management
Colors on a monitor are displayed using combinations of red, green, and blue light 
(called RGB), while printed colors are typically created using a combination of four 
ink colors—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (called CMYK). These four inks are 
called process colors because they are the standard inks used in the four-color print-
ing process. 
RGB image with red, green, and blue channels
CMYK image with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black channels
Because the RGB and CMYK color models use different methods to display colors, 
each reproduces a different gamut, or range, of colors. For example, RGB uses light 
to produce color, so its gamut includes neon colors, such as those you’d see in a 
neon sign. In contrast, printing inks excel at reproducing certain colors that can lie 
outside the RGB gamut, such as some pastels and pure black.

 Note: One exercise 
in this lesson requires 
that your computer 
be connected to a 
PostScript color printer. 
If it isn’t, you can do 
most, but not all, of the 
exercises.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 363
But not all RGB and CMYK gamuts are alike. Each monitor and printer model 
differs, and so each displays a slightly different gamut. For example, one brand of 
monitor may produce slightly brighter blues than another. The color space for a 
device is defined by the gamut it can reproduce.
rGB model
A large percentage of the visible spectrum can be represented by mixing red, green, 
and blue (RGB) colored light in various proportions and intensities. Where the colors 
overlap, they create cyan, magenta, yellow, and white.
Because the RGB colors combine to create white, they are also called additive colors. 
Adding all colors together creates white—that is, all light is transmitted back to the 
eye. Additive colors are used for lighting, video, and monitors. Your monitor, for 
example, creates color by emitting light through red, green, and blue phosphors.
CMyK model
The CMYK model is based on the light-absorbing quality of ink printed on paper. As 
white light strikes translucent inks, part of the spectrum is absorbed, while other 
parts are reflected back to your eyes. 
In theory, pure cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) pigments should combine to 
absorb all color and produce black. For this reason, these colors are called subtrac-
tive colors. But because all printing inks contain some impurities, these three inks 
actually produce a muddy brown, and must be combined with black (K) ink to pro-
duce a true black. (K is used instead of B to avoid confusion with blue.) Combining 
these inks to reproduce color is called four-color process printing.
The color management system in Photoshop uses International Color Consortium 
(ICC)-compliant color profiles to convert colors from one color space into another. 
A color profile is a description of a device’s color space, such as the CMYK color 
space of a particular printer. You specify which profiles to use to accurately proof 
and print your images. Once you’ve selected the profiles, Photoshop can embed 
them into your image files, so that Photoshop and other applications can accurately 
manage color for the image.
For information on embedding color profiles, see Photoshop Help.
Before you begin working with color management, you should calibrate your  
monitor. If your monitor doesn’t display colors accurately, color adjustments you 
make based on the image you see on your monitor may not be accurate. For infor-
mation about calibrating your monitor, see Photoshop Help.

Producing and Printing Consistent Color
Getting started
First, start Photoshop and restore its default preferences.
1 Start Photoshop, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore the default preferences. (See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 4.) 
2 When prompted, click Yes to delete the Adobe Photoshop Settings file.
specifying color-management settings
In the first part of this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up a color-managed workflow 
in Photoshop. Most of the color-management controls you need are in the Color 
Settings dialog box.
By default, Photoshop is set up for RGB as part of a digital workflow. If you are pre-
paring artwork for print production, however, you’ll want to change the settings to 
be more appropriate for images that will be printed on paper rather than displayed 
on a screen.
You’ll begin this lesson by creating customized color settings.
1 Choose Edit > Color Settings to open the Color Settings dialog box. 
The bottom of the dialog box interactively describes each option.
2 Move the pointer over each part of the dialog box, including the names of 
areas (such as Working Spaces), the menu names, and the menu options. As 
you move the pointer, Photoshop displays information about each item. When 
you’ve finished, return the options to their defaults. 
Now, you’ll choose a set of options designed for a print workflow, rather than an 
online workflow.
3 Choose North America Prepress 2 from the Settings menu. The working spaces 
and color-management policy options change for a prepress workflow. Then 
click OK.

Proofing an image
You’ll select a proof profile so that you can view a close onscreen representation of 
what an image will look like when printed. An accurate proof profile lets you proof 
on the screen (soft-proof ) for printed output. 
1 Choose File > Open. Navigate to the Lessons/
Lesson14 folder, and double-click the  
14Start.tif file. Click OK if you see an  
embedded profile warning.
An RGB image of a scanned poster opens.
2 Choose File > Save As. Rename the file 
14Working.tif, keep the TIFF format selected, 
and click Save. Click OK in the TIFF Options 
dialog box.  
Before soft-proofing or printing this image, you’ll 
set up a proof profile. A proof profile (also called 
a proof setup) defines how the document is going 
to be printed, and adjusts the onscreen appear-
ance accordingly. Photoshop provides a variety of settings that can help you proof 
images for different uses, including print and display on the web. For this lesson, 
you’ll create a custom proof setup. You can then save the settings for use on other 
images that will be output the same way.
3 Choose View > Proof Setup > Custom. The Customize Proof Condition dialog  
box opens. Make sure Preview is selected.
4 From the Device To Simulate menu, choose a profile that represents the final 
output device, such as that for the printer you’ll use to print the image. If you 
don’t have a specific printer, the profile Working CMYK–U.S. Web Coated 
(SWOP) v2 is generally a good choice.
5 Make sure that Preserve Numbers is not selected. 
The Preserve Numbers option simulates how colors will appear without being 
converted to the output device color space. 
6 From the Rendering Intent menu, choose Relative Colorimetric. 
A rendering intent determines how the color is converted from one color space 
to another. Relative Colorimetric, which preserves color relationships without 
sacrificing color accuracy, is the standard rendering intent for printing in North 
America and Europe.
7 If it’s available for the profile you chose, select Simulate Black Ink. Then 
deselect it, and select Simulate Paper Color; notice that selecting this option 
automatically selects Simulate Black Ink. Click OK.
 Note: The Preserve 
Numbers option is not 
available when the U.S. 
Web Coated (SWOP) v2 
profile is selected.

lesson 14 
Producing and Printing Consistent Color
Notice that the image appears to lose contrast. Paper Color simulates the dingy 
white of real paper, according to the proof profile. Black Ink simulates the dark gray 
that actually prints to most printers, instead of solid black. Not all profiles support 
these options.

Black Ink options selected
Identifying out-of-gamut colors
Most scanned photographs contain RGB colors within the CMYK gamut, so chang-
ing the image to CMYK mode converts all the colors with relatively little substitu-
tion. Images that are created or altered digitally, however, often contain RGB colors 
that are outside the CMYK gamut—for example, neon-colored logos and lights. 
E Tip: To display 
the document with 
and without the proof 
settings, choose View > 
Proof Colors.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 367
Before you convert an image from RGB to CMYK, you can preview the CMYK 
color values while still in RGB mode. 
1 Choose View > Gamut Warning to see out-of-
gamut colors. Adobe Photoshop builds a color-
conversion table, and displays a neutral gray  
in the image window where the colors are out 
of gamut. 
Because the gray can be hard to spot in the image, 
you’ll convert it to a more visible color.
2 Choose Edit > Preferences > Transparency And Gamut (Windows) or  
Photoshop > Preferences > Transparency And Gamut (Mac OS). 
3 Click the color sample in the Gamut Warning area at the bottom of the dialog 
box. Select a vivid color, such as purple or bright green, and click OK. 
4 Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box. 
5 Click anywhere on the image with the Move tool. The bright new color you 
chose appears instead of the neutral gray as the gamut warning color.

lesson 14 
Producing and Printing Consistent Color
6 Choose View > Gamut Warning to turn off the preview of out-of-gamut colors. 
Photoshop will automatically correct these out-of-gamut colors when you save the 
file in Photoshop EPS format later in this lesson. Photoshop EPS format changes 
the RGB image to CMYK, adjusting the RGB colors as needed to bring them into 
the CMYK color gamut.
adjusting an image and printing a proof
The next step in preparing an image for output is to make any color and tonal 
adjustments that are necessary. In this exercise, you’ll add some tonal and color 
adjustments to correct an off-color scan of the original poster.
So that you can compare the image before and after making corrections, you’ll start 
by making a copy.
1 Choose Image > Duplicate, and click OK to duplicate the image. 
2 Choose Window > Arrange > 2 Up Vertical so you can compare the images as 
you work.
You’ll adjust the hue and saturation of the image to move all colors into gamut. 
3 Select 14Working.tif (the original image). 
4 Choose Select > Color Range.
5 In the Color Range dialog box, 
choose Out Of Gamut from the 
Select menu, and then click OK.
The areas that were marked as out 
of gamut earlier are now selected, 
so you can make changes that affect 
only those areas. 

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 369
6 Click the Hue/Saturation button in the Adjustments panel to create a  
Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. (Choose Window > Adjustments if the  
panel isn’t open.) The Hue/Saturation adjustment layer includes a layer mask, 
created from your selection.
7 In the Properties panel, do the following:
•
Drag the Hue slider until the colors look more neutral (we used -5).
•
Drag the Saturation slider until the intensity of the colors looks more 
realistic (we used -40).
•
Leave the Lightness setting at the default value (0). 
8 Choose View > Gamut Warning. You have removed most of the out-of-gamut 
colors from the image. Choose View > Gamut Warning again to deselect it.
9 With 14Working.tif still selected, choose File > Print.
10 In the Print dialog box, do the 
following:
•
Choose your printer from 
the Printer menu.
•
In the Color Management 
area of the dialog box, 
choose Printer Manages 
Colors from the Color 
Handling menu.
•
Choose Hard Proofing from 
the pop-up menu.
•
For Proof Setup, choose 
Working CMYK.
•
If you have a color PostScript printer, click Print to print the image, and 
compare the color with the onscreen version. Otherwise, click Cancel.

lesson 14 
Producing and Printing Consistent Color
saving the image as a CMyK ePs file
You’ll save the image as an EPS file in CMYK format.
1 With 14Working.tif still selected, choose File > Save As.
2 In the Save As dialog box, do the following, and then click Save:
•
Choose Photoshop EPS from the Format menu.
•
Under Color, select Use Proof Setup. Don’t worry about the warning icon; 
you’ll save a copy.
•
Accept the filename 14Working.eps.
3 Click OK in the EPS Options dialog box that appears.
4 Save and then close the 14Working.tif and 14Working copy.tif files.
5 Choose File > Open, navigate to the Lessons/Lesson14 folder, and double-click 
the 14Working.eps file.
Notice in the image file’s title bar that 14Working.eps is a CMYK file.
 Note: These settings 
cause the image to 
be automatically 
converted from RGB 
to CMYK when it is 
saved in the Photoshop 
Encapsulated PostScript 
(EPS) format.

Adobe PhotoshoP Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 371
Printing
When you’re ready to print your image, use the following guidelines for best results:
• Print a color composite, often called a color comp, to proof your image. A color 
composite is a single print that combines the red, green, and blue channels of 
an RGB image (or the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black channels of a CMYK 
image). This indicates what the final printed image will look like.
•
Set the parameters for the halftone screen.
•
Print separations to make sure the image separates correctly.
•
Print to film or plate. 
When you print color separations, Photoshop prints a separate sheet, or plate, for 
each ink. For a CMYK image, it prints four plates, one for each process color. 
In this exercise, you’ll print color separations.
1 With the 14Working.eps image open from the previous exercise, choose  
File > Print.
By default, Photoshop prints any document as a composite image. To print this file 
as separations, you need to explicitly instruct Photoshop in the Print dialog box.
2 In the Print dialog box, do the following:
• In the Color Management 
area, choose Separations 
from the Color Handling 
menu.
• Click Print.
3 Choose File > Close, and don’t 
save the changes.
This lesson has provided an introduction to printing and producing consistent color 
from Adobe Photoshop. If you’re printing on a desktop printer, you can experiment 
with different settings to find the best color and print settings for your system. If 
you’re preparing images for professional printing, consult with your print service 
provider to determine the best settings to use. For more information about color 
management, printing options, and color separations, see Photoshop Help.

What are color separations? 
review answers
1 To reproduce color accurately, first calibrate your monitor, and then use the Color 
Settings dialog box to specify which color spaces to use. For example, you can specify 
which RGB color space to use for online images, and which CMYK color space to use 
for images that will be printed. You can then proof the image, check for out-of-gamut 
colors, adjust colors as needed, and—for printed images—create color separations.
2 A gamut is the range of colors that can be reproduced by a color model or device. For 
example, the RGB and CMYK color models have different gamuts, as do any two RGB 
scanners.
3 A color profile is a description of a device’s color space, such as the CMYK color space 
of a particular printer. Applications such as Photoshop can interpret color profiles 
in an image to maintain consistent color across different applications, platforms, and 
devices.
4 Color separations are separate plates for each ink used in a document. Often, you’ll 
print color separations for the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) inks.
