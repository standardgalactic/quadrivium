Dedication
This book is dedicated to my triplets, Gwen, Grant, and Brianne, for a crazy 
and wonderful ride during this writing process that I will never forget. I also 
want to dedicate this book to my husband, Mark, for his patience, encourage­
ment, and incredible support during this time.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Being pregnant with triplets during this writing process made for a some­
times crazy and difficult time. The following team of people helped me to 
finish on time and gave me amazing support — more than I could have asked 
for. You are all such a compassionate group of people, making this a wonder­
ful experience for me.
To start, I want to thank Matt Wagner from Fresh Books and assistant editor 
Erin Calligan Mooney for thinking of me for this project. It was such a thrill 
to work with you, and your support during this time is greatly appreciated 
beyond words.
Chrissy Guthrie, my project editor, made this such an enjoyable process with 
such a great and amazing attitude helping me to make everything readable 
and provide valuable information for readers. It was so great to work with 
someone who had the same goal in mind as me: helping people reach their 
weight-loss and health goals in a realistic way so they can achieve long-term 
results. My heartfelt gratitude for her understanding and help during some 
tough times, going well beyond her project editor duties.
A major thank you to Rachel Nix for also going above and beyond with the 
technical review of this book.
And finally, a million thanks to Lynn Grieger for helping me to pick up the 
pieces and finish this project with such ease. You are a true professional, 
writer, and friend.

Introduction
C
arbohydrate-bashing is all the rage these days. In fact, it often seems 
like you can’t have a casual conversation without someone mentioning 
he’s trying to eat low-carb, complaining that she’s addicted to carbs, or whin­
ing about how he can never eat potatoes. Somehow carbohydrates are “bad,” 
and anyone who overindulges in anything that contains even a whiff of carbo­
hydrates is equally “bad.” It’s as if carbs have become their own food group 
to be avoided!
The thing is, the human body requires carbohydrates to function. Foods 
contain carbohydrates for precisely that reason. So clearly society needs 
to get beyond the simple bad carb/good carb classifications and figure out 
exactly what type of carbohydrate-containing foods help promote health and 
improve energy levels.
Enter the glycemic index, a scientific method for calculating the way carbo­
hydrates in food act in the body. By giving foods a glycemic number, ranging 
from 0 to 100, you know at a glance what to expect. Because people rarely 
eat just one food by itself, and because folks tend to eat varying amounts of 
foods, scientists also came up with the glycemic load. It takes into account 
all the carbohydrates in foods you eat at one time, along with the amounts of 
those carbohydrate-containing foods, and calculates a number.
In short, the glycemic index and glycemic load are all about choosing carbo­
hydrate-containing foods wisely and putting them to work for you. This book, 
in turn, is all about showing you how to use the glycemic index and glycemic 
load to your advantage in your quest for weight loss and everyday health.
About This Book
If you want to lose weight and improve your overall health, then The Glycemic 
Index Diet For Dummies is for you. This book offers a wealth of information 
about both the glycemic index and the glycemic load to help you incorporate 
greater amounts of low-glycemic foods in your lifestyle. In the following pages, 
I give you specific tips and suggestions on how to choose lower-glycemic foods 
whether you’re grocery shopping, eating out on the weekend, or enjoying a 
family vacation or holiday. I even include tasty, simple-to-prepare recipes that 
use low-glycemic foods and throw in a list of low-, medium-, and high-glycemic 
foods that you can use as a quick-reference tool.

2
The Glycemic Index Diet For Dummies 
Whether you’re reading this book because you don’t know anything about the 
glycemic index and want to find out more or you’re already using the glycemic 
index to make smarter food choices, consider The Glycemic Index Diet For 
Dummies your trusty resource for adopting a healthier lifestyle.
Conventions Used in This Book
It’s a common misconception these days that carbohydrates, or carbs, are their 
own food group. However, that’s simply not the case. They’re actually calorie-
containing nutrients found in food. Most food groups contain carbs; the only 
ones that don’t are meat (including fish and poultry) and fat sources (think oils 
and butter). So when I refer to carbs throughout this book, I’m referring to the 
nutrient your body uses to create energy, not a made-up food group.
Following are a few additional conventions I’ve used that you should be 
aware of:
	
✓	Whenever I define a word (or put emphasis on a certain word or phrase),
I use italics.
	
✓	Keywords and the specific action steps in numbered lists appear in 
boldface.
	
✓	Web sites appear in monofont; no extra spaces or punctuation have 
been added, so type ’em exactly as you see ’em.
Foolish Assumptions
I wrote this book for the people who want to lose weight and maintain that 
weight loss long-term while still enjoying good-tasting food. I also wrote this 
book for people who have a family history of diabetes or heart disease and 
want to take steps to improve their health now, before they begin experiencing 
medical problems. (Note: If you already have diabetes or heart disease, you 
can use the information throughout this book to take control of your health 
and improve how you feel on a day-to-day basis.)
Because you’re reading a book about food, I’m taking a leap here and assum­
ing that you enjoy eating. Well, you’re in luck! This book includes not only 
dozens of recipes to help satiate your taste buds but also the reasons why 
these recipes were selected and what they’re going to do for you.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
One of the fun things about a For Dummies book is finding all the extra infor­
mation that you can skip over if you’re not interested or don’t have time to 
check it out. Sidebars (indicated by the gray boxes) and text marked with a 
Technical Stuff icon are included to enhance and round out your understand­
ing of the topic. But if you’re just after the nitty-gritty, you can skip these 
elements without missing anything essential.
How This Book Is Organized
The Glycemic Index Diet For Dummies is organized into seven parts. Here’s a 
quick breakdown of what you can find in each one. Enjoy!
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index 
as a Weight-Loss Tool
Part I introduces you to the glycemic index and explains how it was developed. 
It clarifies the differences between the glycemic index and the glycemic load, 
and it lets you know when to use each of these tools for meal planning. This 
part also introduces you to using the glycemic index as a weight-loss tool and 
gives you several suggestions for losing weight in a healthy, sustained manner. 
In this part, I show you how to apply the glycemic index whether you’re young, 
pregnant, or have simply tried every diet known to man (plus a few that seem 
to have come from outer space!).
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet
In Part II, I give you specific recommendations and suggestions on how to 
change your eating habits so you can enjoy the benefits of choosing low-
glycemic foods. I help you figure out how to set realistic goals that fit your 
lifestyle without becoming overwhelming, and I explain how you can increase 
your metabolism to promote weight loss.
Because often people don’t realize quite how to start implementing healthy-
eating strategies, I provide pointers on watching your portion sizes, adding 
balance to your meals, and much more. I even share specific suggestions on 
how to shop for groceries without spending hours in the store getting side­
tracked by high-glycemic items.

The Glycemic Index Diet For Dummies 
Part III: Overcoming Challenges 
and Obstacles
I know that making changes to the way you usually eat isn’t easy, which is 
why this part addresses some of the most difficult situations you can expect 
to encounter. This part is where you discover how to use the glycemic index 
when you eat out, attend a holiday party, or go on vacation. Now I love holi­
days and vacations just as much as the next gal, but I also know what tempt­
ing times they are when you’re trying to stick to a new, healthier lifestyle. 
Consequently, this part shows you how simple it can be to continue your new 
low-glycemic eating habits even when you’re away from home and having fun.
Changing habits isn’t easy thanks to the inevitable weight-loss pitfall or 
two, and everybody can use a support system to meet his or her goals. 
Fortunately, this part provides lots of suggestions on overcoming pitfalls and 
finding the support you need.
Part IV: Cooking and Eating 
the Low-Glycemic Way
If you love to cook, and of course eat, delicious food, then get ready to 
devour Part IV. It’s chock-full of recipes that are perfect whether you’re an 
expert chef or a boiling-water-is-rough kind of cook. Get ready to absorb 
ideas for preparing a variety of meals as well as specific instructions for some 
tricky techniques (such as cooking beans).
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: 
Other Health Connections
I truly want to encourage you to incorporate the suggestions in this book for 
the rest of your life, and this part gives you the tools you need to do just that. 
And because regular exercise is such a crucial component to lasting weight 
management, this part also features a chapter on exercise and activity. 
Finally, you should know that following a low-glycemic diet provides a wealth 
of health benefits; this part reveals just how that works. (Happy with your 
current weight? You can use the information in this part to improve your 
overall health!)

 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI is not only fun to read but also helpful and enlightening. First off, it 
debunks several myths about the glycemic index and sets the record straight 
on using the glycemic index along with other nutrition strategies. It then goes 
on to highlight specific foods whose low-glycemic status and health benefits 
may (pleasantly!) surprise you.
Part VII: Appendixes
The first appendix in this part is a list of low-, medium-, and high-glycemic 
foods that I bet you’ll find yourself using over and over again. Granted, not 
every food has been tested for its glycemic load, but in the cases where data 
is available, you now have that information at your fingertips in an easy-to-
use chart format. This part also features a metric conversion chart so you 
don’t have to go hunting for that conversion magnet you received ten years 
ago that’s buried somewhere in the netherworld of your kitchen.

The Glycemic Index Diet For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
If you like to read the last couple pages of a novel first to see whether you’re 
going to like it, go right ahead with this book. That’s right, my friend. You 
don’t have to start with Chapter 1 and read straight through to the end. 
Peruse the Table of Contents, pick out the topics that mean the most to you, 
and start there. Feel free to flip back and forth and read what you need at 
that moment.
If you’re a newbie when it comes to the glycemic index, start with Chapters 1 
and 2. If you’re already somewhat familiar with the glycemic index but aren’t 
sure about the glycemic load, go to Chapter 4. Ready to begin incorporating 
low-glycemic foods into your diet? Check out Part II for advice and Part IV for 
some delicious recipes. Wherever you decide to start, you’re sure to pick up 
useful, empowering information that you can continue turning to for years 
to come.

Part I
Exploring the 
Glycemic 
Index as a 
Weight-Loss Tool

In this part . . .
T
he glycemic index was originally developed as a way 
to scientifically determine how different foods that 
contain carbohydrates — fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, 
and dairy products — affect blood sugar levels. Since that 
initial research took place more than 30 years ago, scientists 
have come to understand that the glycemic index can be 
effectively used in a variety of ways, including weight loss.
This part explains the glycemic index and introduces you 
to the glycemic load, one step beyond the glycemic index 
that incorporates the amounts of foods you eat. In these 
pages, I review the role of fiber in your food choices and 
show you how using the glycemic index can help you feel 
more satisfied while consuming fewer total calories. After 
you understand how the glycemic index works and its role 
in promoting healthy weight loss without the need to fol­
low a specific or restrictive diet, I help you figure out how 
using the glycemic index can work for your individual 
situation.

Chapter 1
Introducing the Glycemic Index 
and How to Use It to Lose Weight
In This Chapter
▶	Surveying the ins and outs of the glycemic index
▶	Looking at how using the glycemic index can help you lose weight
▶	Recognizing that the glycemic index “diet” isn’t like diets you’ve tried before
▶	Reviewing the additional benefits of following a low-glycemic diet
T
he glycemic index was first introduced in the early 1980s as a way for 
people with diabetes to achieve tighter blood sugar control and improve 
their overall health. Only 62 foods were part of the original glycemic index 
research. Fast forward to today, and you find that hundreds of foods have 
now been tested. Companies are even working to develop lower-glycemic 
foods to meet growing consumer demand.
In this chapter, I review the research behind the glycemic index and explain 
how adding more low-glycemic foods to your diet can help you lose weight, 
embrace a healthier lifestyle, decrease your risk of heart disease, manage 
your blood sugar, increase your energy levels, and improve your mood. Sure, 
all of that may sound too good to be true, but the scientific research is clear: 
Looking beyond total carbohydrate content of foods into how different foods 
affect blood sugar and insulin levels opens up a doorway into good health.
Getting to Know the Glycemic Index
The glycemic index is a scientific way of looking at how the carbohydrates in 
foods affect blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels. Scientists know that all car­
bohydrates raise blood sugar, but the glycemic index takes this understanding 
one step further by figuring out how much a specific food raises blood sugar.

10
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
When you use the glycemic index to plan your meals and snacks, you’re 
following a glycemic index diet. It’s not a “diet” in the sense that there are 
specific meal plans you need to follow, lists of foods to eat and foods to avoid, 
and other types of rules that are all too familiar to people who’ve tried various 
weight-loss diet plans. Instead, the glycemic index gives you a method for 
selecting foods that meet your specific needs and desires.
	
You know those overlay maps, where you start with a very basic map, add an 
overlay with more detail, then add another overlay with yet more detail, and 
so on until you have a complete picture of a specific area? Think of using the 
glycemic index in a similar way.
	
✓	The first “overlay” is basic meal planning. Your body tells you it’s 
hungry and wants food.
	
✓	Next comes the layer of basic nutrition, which is all about balance. 
Your meal needs to include protein (chicken, fish, lean red meat, soy 
products, eggs, nuts/seeds), vegetables, and starch (potato, pasta, rice, 
bread) to keep your body happy. If you throw in a glass of milk and 
some fruit on the side, your body will be even happier.
	
✓	Finally, you add in the glycemic index for a complete picture. Because 
the glycemic index applies solely to foods that contain carbohydrates, 
it applies only to the vegetable, starch, milk, and fruit portions of your 
meal. Theoretically you already have an understanding of these foods’ 
nutritional values. The glycemic index completes the picture by telling 
you how these foods will impact your blood sugar, which affects every­
thing from your energy level to your food cravings.
Now that you have a basic understanding of the glycemic index, check out 
the following sections for the scoop on how it’s measured and how an added 
bit of information makes it even more valuable.
Measuring the glycemic index
	
The glycemic index ranks foods on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how quickly they 
raise blood sugar levels. Foods that raise blood sugar quickly have a higher 
number, whereas foods that take longer to affect blood sugar levels have a 
lower number.
To measure the glycemic index of a food, a specific weight of the digestible 
carbohydrates in the food (usually 50 grams, which is about 4 tablespoons 
of sugar) is fed to at least ten different people who volunteer for the study. 
Their blood sugar levels are measured every 15 to 30 minutes over a two-
hour period to develop a blood sugar response curve. The blood sugar 
response of each food is compared to that of a test food, typically table sugar 
(glucose), which is assigned the number 100. The responses for each test 
subject are averaged, resulting in the glycemic index number for that food. 

11
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
Every individual person may have a slightly different glycemic (blood sugar) 
response to foods, which is why the tests use a number of volunteers and 
average their results together.
	
The information on glycemic index (GI) lists is divided into three basic catego­
ries so you don’t have to get caught up in numbers and can instead focus on 
the primary goal of the glycemic index — choosing foods that keep your blood 
sugar levels more even, resulting in longer-lasting satiety (the feeling of full­
ness) and improved health. Here are the three categories:
	
✓	GI of 55 or less = low
	
✓	GI of 56 to 69 = medium
	
✓	GI of 70 or more = high
Introducing the glycemic load
Putting a numerical value on how various carbohydrate-containing foods 
affect blood sugar levels — the glycemic index — is great. However, the gly­
cemic index is calculated using a standard weight of food, usually 50 grams. 
A food’s glycemic index actually changes based on the amount of it that you 
eat, which is why a standard weight amount is always used when calculating 
the glycemic index. In real life, you don’t always eat a standard amount of 
food. Sometimes you may eat two bowls of cereal at breakfast; other times 
you may eat one. Occasionally you want second helpings of pasta or an extra 
roll at dinner. You know what it’s like.
The glycemic index is calculated not only for a specific weight of food but 
also for eating just that one food. That’s great for researching how one par­
ticular food affects blood sugar levels, but what happens when you eat more 
than one food at a time, such as a peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk 
and an apple?
This is where a little something called the glycemic load becomes important. 
I cover glycemic load extensively in Chapter 4, but here are the basics: The 
glycemic load applies the glycemic index to the amount of food you’re actu­
ally going to eat, or to the total amount of carbohydrate-containing foods in 
a meal or snack. To calculate the glycemic load (GL), multiply the glycemic 
index (GI) of a food by the amount of carbohydrates in the food and then 
divide by 100. For example, 1 cup of watermelon has a GI of 72 and contains 
10 grams of carbohydrates. 72 × 10 = 720, and 720 ÷ 100 = 7, the glycemic load 
of 1 cup of watermelon. If you eat two cups of watermelon, use this calcula­
tion: 72 × 20 = 1,440; 1,440 ÷ 100 = a GL of 14.
What if you eat a turkey sandwich with two pieces of bread and drink one cup 
of fat-free milk? A slice of white bread has a GI of 70, and each slice contains 
15 grams of carbohydrates. One cup of fat-free milk has a GI of 32 and 

12
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
contains 13 grams of carbohydrates. The GL for this meal is 44 (70 + 32 = 102; 
102 × 43 = 4,386; 4,386 ÷ 100 = GL of 44).
	
Just like the glycemic index, glycemic load levels are divided into three 
categories:
	
✓	GL of 10 or less = low
	
✓	GL of 11 to 19 = medium
	
✓	GL of 20 or more = high
	
A basic guideline is to keep your total daily glycemic load under 100. In this 
case, if you’re eating three meals per day and each meal has about the same 
glycemic load, you’ll go over the ideal total maximum of 100. To prevent your­
self from going over, choose to balance a higher-glycemic meal with a lower-
glycemic one or swap out a higher-glycemic food for a lower-glycemic one to 
reduce a meal’s overall glycemic load.
A brief history of the glycemic index
In 1981, scientists at the University of Toronto 
conducted groundbreaking research on the 
blood sugar effects of 62 different types of 
foods containing carbohydrates: vegetables, 
fruit, milk, legumes, and breakfast cereals. 
They found significant differences between dif­
ferent types of carbohydrate-containing foods, 
which led them to suggest using the glycemic 
index as a way to classify carbohydrate foods 
by how quickly they raise blood sugar levels. 
The glycemic index was first used as a way 
of helping people with diabetes control their 
blood sugar levels, moving beyond simple 
carbohydrate counting. Over the years and 
with more research, the glycemic index has 
become an important nutrition tool for several 
other chronic conditions, including Polycystic 
Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), metabolic syndrome, 
and diabetes.
Jennie Brand Miller, of the University of 
Sydney’s Human Nutrition Unit, is one of the 
recognized leaders in glycemic index research. 
She’s the lead author of the authoritative 
International Tables of Glycemic Index pub­
lished by the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition. Her group continues to test the gly­
cemic index of a wide variety of different foods 
so that consumers, health professionals, and 
scientists can know exactly how different foods 
influence blood sugar.
Australia and Canada continue to be leaders in 
testing large numbers of foods to help consum­
ers more easily choose low-glycemic foods. 
Australia started the GI Symbol Program in 2002 
to clearly identify proven low-glycemic foods. 
Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom 
have approved the GI Symbol for use on food 
labels, making it easy to find low-glycemic 
foods in these countries. The United States has 
adopted a seal from an accredited testing orga­
nization; food companies can have their foods 
tested by the organization and can use the Low 
Glycemic Seal if their foods pass the test. For 
more information on this seal program, head to

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
How Does the Glycemic Index 
Work for Weight Loss?
What does every traditional weight-loss diet have in common? Each one 
promotes its own twist on losing weight, but at the end they all come down 
to one truth — eat fewer calories. I’m not going to argue with that. Paying 
attention to the amount of calories you consume and increasing the number 
of calories you burn each day through exercise and just moving around is 
crucial for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.
If counting calories was all you needed to do to lose weight, I could theoreti­
cally eat candy bars all day and lose weight as long as I kept under my daily 
calorie limit. However, there’s more to weight loss than just counting calo­
ries. Choosing healthier foods that provide energy and promote a strong, fit 
body is just as important as sticking to a calorie goal.
The glycemic index is a tool you can use as part of your overall weight-control 
and healthy-eating strategies. Why? Because the glycemic index goes beyond 
calories; it encourages you to look at the way foods are digested and metabo­
lized in your body and what impact that has on your body weight and how full 
you feel after eating. If biology and chemistry weren’t your strong points in 
school, don’t worry. The glycemic index puts all the science together into a list 
of foods categorized by their effect on blood sugar and insulin.
Use a glycemic index list as a weight-loss tool by selecting low-glycemic foods 
or balancing out a high-glycemic food choice with a lower-glycemic one. 
There’s no one right way to do this. Nor is there a black-and-white approach 
where you’re either “on” or “off” the diet. Just use the information in the gly­
cemic index list to add additional healthy benefits to your food choices.
The sections that follow delve into the three factors— blood sugar, carbohy­
drates, and insulin — that combine to make the glycemic index effective for 
weight loss. (Note: If weight loss is your primary goal, flip to Chapter 3 for more 
information on incorporating the glycemic index as a weight-loss strategy.)
Getting the 411 on blood sugar
Why all the fuss about blood sugar? Well, blood sugar is the primary energy 
source for every cell in the human body, especially brain cells. Blood sugar is 
the energy that powers your body, just like gasoline is the energy that powers 
your car. Although many people may falsely believe that any blood sugar is a 
bad thing, your body actually works hard to maintain even blood sugar levels 
to promote optimal health. The human body produces insulin to lower blood 

14
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
sugar levels and another hormone, called glucagon, to help raise blood sugar 
levels. Normally, blood sugar stays in the range of 70 to 140 milligrams of 
blood sugar per deciliter of blood (abbreviated 70–140mg/dL), no matter how 
much sugar or carbohydrates you eat — or don’t eat.
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, occurs when blood sugar levels drop 
below 70mg/dL. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include blurry vision, a shaky 
feeling, and confusion. At the other end of the spectrum, hyperglycemia, or 
high levels of blood sugar, happens when the body doesn’t produce enough 
insulin or when insulin isn’t working the way it’s supposed to. The symp­
toms of hyperglycemia — increased thirst and increased urination are two of 
the more common ones — are sometimes tough to spot. Many people have 
elevated blood sugar levels for months or even years before they’re actually 
diagnosed with diabetes. Such chronically high levels of blood sugar not only 
damage blood vessels but also play a role in the progression of heart disease.
	
People with diabetes occasionally experience hypo- or hyperglycemia. Even 
people without diabetes may have fluctuations in blood sugar levels that 
leave them feeling tired or out of sorts. Using the glycemic index to choose 
your foods will help you keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range. 
Chapter 2 covers the role of the glycemic index in managing healthy blood 
sugar levels in more detail.
	
Using the glycemic index to lose weight can be especially helpful for people with 
insulin resistance (a common precursor of Type 2 diabetes). With insulin resis­
tance, your body produces plenty of insulin, but your muscles resist the action 
of insulin, preventing it from doing its job (meaning your body holds onto blood 
sugar instead of getting rid of it). Your body keeps making more insulin in an 
attempt to lower blood sugar levels, and you’re stuck in a vicious cycle of insulin 
resistance that can lead to weight gain. Follow a low-glycemic diet, and you get a 
cascade of beneficial effects: Your blood sugar level doesn’t rise as high, which 
means your body doesn’t need to produce as much insulin, which in turn helps 
your muscles use blood sugar and insulin more effectively. (Check out Chapter 5 
for more about insulin resistance and the glycemic index.)
Understanding the role of carbohydrates
Food is made up of three macronutrients that contain calories:
	
✓	Carbohydrates: The body’s primary fuel source, providing energy for 
the brain, muscles, and organs.
	
✓	Protein: The building block of body tissues. Rarely used for energy 
because it has other, more valuable uses.
	
✓	Fat: Provides energy, but only when you’ve used up carbohydrates 
(that’s why reducing body fat stores and losing weight is so tough).

15
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
Health experts recommend that 40 to 60 percent of a person’s total calorie 
intake should come from carbohydrates. Admittedly, that’s a wide range, but 
that range exists for several reasons. Active people need more carbohydrates 
to fuel their muscles, and children and adolescents need carbohydrates 
to fuel growth. On the other hand, people who are sedentary need smaller 
amounts of carbohydrates.
Because carbohydrates are the body’s primary source of energy, it makes 
sense that just about every food group contains some carbohydrates. Fruits, 
vegetables, and grains are the primary sources of carbohydrates in foods, 
although milk, yogurt, and legumes also contain carbohydrates. The only 
food groups that contain no carbohydrates are animal meat and fat such as 
butter, margarine, and olive oil.
	
Whenever I talk about the glycemic index, I’m really talking about foods that con­
tain carbohydrates. Plenty of misconceptions about carbohydrates are floating 
around, with some people thinking that all carbs are bad and that you should 
throw out the whole lot if you’re trying to lose weight. Not true! Carbohydrates 
are an essential nutrient, and by using the glycemic index, you can choose foods 
that contain carbohydrates yet help you meet your weight goals.
The glycemic index helps you move beyond simply paying attention to the 
amount of carbohydrates you consume and gives you more specific information 
about how different types of carbohydrate-containing foods metabolize in your 
body and raise blood sugar levels. Because of the glycemic index, scientists 
know that foods that contain the same amount of total carbohydrate but have 
different glycemic index numbers will raise blood sugar levels differently.
Here’s an example: 1 cup of dark cherries and one medium ear of sweet corn 
both contain 15 grams of carbohydrates. If you only count carbohydrates, 
you’d expect both the cherries and the corn to raise your blood sugar levels 
equally, right? Go one step further and look at the glycemic index of the foods 
individually. The glycemic index of 1 cup of dark cherries is 63, whereas the 
sweet corn has a glycemic index of 48. Now you know that the sweet corn will 
cause a lower rise in blood sugar and insulin levels compared to the same 
amount of carbohydrates in the cherries. The calories are almost the same — 
73 in the cherries and 84 in the sweet corn. The important difference when it 
comes to weight control is the foods’ glycemic index numbers: The lower the 
glycemic number, the lower the blood sugar response and required amount 
of insulin (a storage hormone that makes weight loss difficult). Use Appendix 
A to quickly look up the glycemic load of your favorite foods and find lower-
glycemic foods to replace higher-glycemic ones when necessary.

16
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Seeing how insulin plays a part
Insulin is a hormone secreted by a group of cells within the pancreas (called 
the islet cells, just in case you were wondering) whenever you eat foods that 
contain carbohydrates. As the carbohydrates are digested and metabolized 
into blood sugar, your pancreas notices a rise in blood sugar levels and 
sends out insulin. Insulin allows blood sugar to move into each and every cell 
to provide them with necessary energy. Think of it as the key that unlocks 
the door into the cells for blood sugar to enter. If you don’t have enough insu­
lin production, you effectively starve to death even though you eat a lot of 
food because blood sugar can’t get into the cells to provide energy.
	
People with Type 1 diabetes inject themselves with insulin so as not to starve 
their cells of energy. People with Type 2 diabetes often make plenty of insulin, 
but for some reason their insulin doesn’t work effectively. Think of this insulin 
resistance as trying to use your house key to start your car: The key won’t fit 
into the keyhole, and the car won’t start.
	
Insulin plays other important roles within the body, and here’s where its role 
in weight management is crucial. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, which is the 
process of converting blood sugar to fatty acids that can then be stored as 
body fat for later use as fuel. Fatty acids are like your body’s energy storage 
locker. When you run low on available blood sugar for energy, your body 
can use those stored fatty acids for energy. However, insulin also makes that 
breakdown process exceedingly difficult. In short, high levels of insulin make 
it easier to gain weight and more difficult to lose it.
Putting it all together
Blood sugar, carbohydrates, and insulin all come together to affect body 
weight. Carbohydrates are digested and metabolilzed into blood sugar. Rising 
levels of blood sugar cause the pancreas to produce insulin. Higher levels of 
insulin then promote body fat storage.
If you want to lose weight, you can try following a low-carb diet to interrupt 
this process, but that drastic move really isn’t a solution because your body 
needs the nutrients found in foods that contain carbohydrates.
	
A smarter choice for weight loss is to use the glycemic index to make sound 
decisions about which carbohydrate-containing foods you’re going to eat. 
That way you stay satisfied longer; you get the benefit of fiber, vitamins, and 
minerals from carb-containing foods; your blood sugar levels stay even; your 
body produces less insulin; and you lose weight!

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
Moving beyond Traditional Diet Plans
Forget the traditional food lists and stringent calorie requirements. That’s 
right. Chuck ’em out the window! The low-glycemic way of eating isn’t a diet 
in the traditional sense — it’s a lifestyle change. A low-glycemic “diet” is 
about listening to and working with your body to achieve long-term weight-
loss (and health!) success. When you commit to this way of eating, you dis­
cover more about the foods you eat. You also realize that you can still enjoy 
food while making the best choices for weight loss and your overall health. 
The following sections help get you thinking about the glycemic index diet as 
a lifestyle change rather than a traditional diet plan.
Embracing lifestyle change and 
abandoning the temporary diet
Even though losing weight isn’t easy, keeping the weight off is even more dif­
ficult. It doesn’t matter what type of “diet” people follow; after one year, most 
folks gain back about 50 percent of the weight they lost. Yet some people are 
able to lose significant amounts of weight and keep it off. Individuals who 
embrace a low-glycemic diet as a way of life rather than a temporary diet can 
be among the latter group.
The National Weight Control Registry tracks people who’ve lost at least 30 
pounds and kept it off at least five years. It has found that many people don’t 
follow a specific diet plan. Sure, they make changes to their eating habits 
and activity levels, but not as part of a set “diet.” Instead, they make gradual 
changes that they incorporate into their lives and that they keep on doing 
even after they’ve achieved their weight-loss goals.
	
Lifestyle change, not a temporary diet, is the key to enjoying a healthy weight 
for the rest of your life. Just think of these differences between the two:
	
✓	A diet is when you follow a set meal plan developed by someone famous 
who wrote a book; lifestyle change is when you swap a candy bar for a 
piece of fruit as a midmorning snack and brown-bag your lunch instead 
of zipping through the fast food drive-through.
	
✓	A diet is when you eliminate specific foods because they’re too high in 
fat, calories, or carbohydrates; a lifestyle change is when you gradually 
eat fewer of these foods on a weekly basis.
	
✓	A diet is when you follow a low-carb meal plan that lists foods to eat and 
foods to avoid; a lifestyle change is when you swap a lower-glycemic 
food for a higher-glycemic food a couple times each day.

18
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
According to the available scientific literature, people lost more weight on a 
low-glycemic eating plan (one where they didn’t have to count calories or mea­
sure out food portions) than on a high-protein eating plan. They also lowered 
their cholesterol levels.
	
Focusing on the positives — like all the great health benefits you receive just 
by following a low-glycemic diet — makes lifestyle changes a bit easier to 
make. Chapter 20 includes a list of those benefits as well as additional sugges­
tions for making successful lifestyle changes.
Tossing strict rules out the window
If you’ve been around the dieting block a time or two, you’re well aware that 
diets are full of rules. They instruct you on what you can eat, when you can 
eat it, and how much of it you can eat. They tell you when to exercise, how 
much to exercise, and what type of exercise you should do to burn the most 
calories. They make you count calories, fat, fiber, carbohydrates, or a combi­
nation of all four.
The glycemic index diet is different, largely because it’s not really a diet. It’s 
actually just a different way of choosing your foods. When you follow a low-
glycemic diet, you can forget about rules and traditional dieting phases and 
get back to what eating is all about — enjoying food that tastes good and is 
good for you.
One of the best things about low-glycemic foods is that they fill you up so 
you’re not searching through the cupboards looking for something to eat 
every couple hours. That’s because low-glycemic foods have a lower energy 
density, which I explain in more detail in Chapter 7. Foods with a lower 
energy density provide fewer calories yet still fill you up. Low-glycemic foods 
also have less of an effect on blood sugar, require less insulin (so you aren’t 
overworking your pancreas — the organ that supplies insulin), and keep you 
from experiencing the dramatic rise and consequent fall of blood sugar that 
leaves you feeling hungry, tired, unfocused, and even irritable.
By choosing low-glycemic foods, you’ll naturally eat fewer calories, feel fuller 
for longer, and lose weight. Granted, you probably won’t lose 5 pounds in a 
week, but that’s okay because you’re in this for a lifetime, not a week. If you 
lose 2 pounds per month, that’s still 24 pounds in a year. Who wouldn’t love 
to lose 24 pounds while still enjoying meals and snacks?

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
Planning, cooking, and enjoying 
healthy meals
Eating should be an enjoyable experience, not one during which you have to 
agonize about every single aspect of a meal. When you follow a low-glycemic 
lifestyle, you’re not eliminating the foods you enjoy. Instead, you’re creating 
balance in your diet through moderation in your food choices, which means 
you may still have that high-glycemic cookie once in a while but when you do 
you’re choosing more low-glycemic foods throughout the day to balance it out.
The key here is to enjoy food. I want you to enjoy your meals, savor your 
foods, and look forward to mealtimes. If you enjoy your food choices, you’re 
more likely to continue with this healthier way of eating. Sure, you may be 
able to tolerate a bland, low-calorie diet for a few days or weeks. But over 
time food has to taste good or else you’re simply not going to put up with 
it. You don’t need to worry about that with the glycemic index diet, though, 
because you’re eating foods you already enjoy!
With just a small amount of thought, you can easily and quickly plan satisfy­
ing meals that will help you lose weight. Use Appendix A to identify lower-
glycemic foods you already enjoy or as a way to find lower-glycemic swaps 
for higher-glycemic favorites. Also check out Chapter 9 for a bevy of healthy-
eating strategies.
If you love to cook, check out the delicious and satisfying recipes in Part IV. 
I’ve included everything from quick-and-easy breakfasts and lunches to sat­
isfying dinners and even snack and dessert recipes. Leery of diving into new-
to-you recipes and prefer to rely on your old stand-bys? Good news! You can 
still enjoy them thanks to the recipe makeovers in Chapter 15 that convert 
family favorites into their lower-glycemic counterparts.
Making exercise a part of your life
I like to encourage my clients to think about activity and exercise like brush­
ing your teeth. You brush your teeth at least once every day, right? You may 
not like brushing your teeth, but you do it because you don’t want to get 
cavities, you like the way your breath smells afterward, and you don’t want 
to walk around with mossy teeth. The benefits of exercising regularly are just 
as important as those of brushing your teeth daily, perhaps even more so if 
you’re looking to lose weight.

20
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
To lose weight long-term, you need to be in energy balance — something 
that’s difficult to achieve when you focus on food intake alone. That’s why 
exercise is so important to weight-loss efforts (not to mention the huge benefit 
exercise has on overall health!). To lose weight in a healthy way, you can’t just 
keep cutting back on the amount of calories you consume. You need to get up 
and burn calories through movement (which stimulates your metabolism 
hours after you exercise; see Chapter 8 for details).
	
If the word exercise makes you think of sweaty gyms, loud music, and instruc­
tors who yell at you to do things that hurt, try thinking of exercise as activity 
and movement instead. Dancing, gardening, puttering around in the garage, 
walking, biking, sledding, and playing hopscotch with your kids all fall into the 
activity-and-movement category. Countless other things do too. See for your­
self in Chapter 21, which offers guidance on making daily exercise a part of 
your life, just like brushing your teeth.
Looking at Other Benefits of 
a Low-Glycemic Diet
Research continues to accumulate showing the health benefits of eating a 
low-glycemic diet. At this point, health professionals see the value in follow­
ing a low-glycemic diet, along with other healthy nutrition guidelines such as 
consuming less saturated fat and cholesterol, choosing high-fiber foods, and 
maintaining a lower sodium intake. In addition to weight loss, a low-glycemic 
diet has been connected to better blood sugar and insulin control, disease 
prevention, increased energy, and improved mood. The next sections delve 
into these added benefits in detail.
	
Just because a food is low-glycemic doesn’t mean it’s healthy, and just 
because a food is high-glycemic doesn’t necessarily mean it’s an unhealthy 
food choice. The glycemic index is one additional tool for healthy meal plan­
ning, not the only tool. So don’t forget all you know about good nutrition.
Better blood sugar and insulin control
The American Diabetes Association acknowledges that low-glycemic foods 
that are also high in fiber and a good source of nutrients can be part of an 
overall healthy diet. Including low-glycemic foods within an overall carbohy­
drate budget can provide additional blood sugar–control benefits because 
eating lower-glycemic foods helps keep blood sugar levels under better con­
trol and decreases the need for insulin.

21
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
Society now knows that Type 2 diabetes develops gradually over time, and 
physicians are encouraged to notice when blood sugar levels start creeping 
up. Prediabetes is defined as a fasting blood sugar between 100 and 126 mil­
ligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). When your fasting blood 
sugar climbs above 126mg/dL, you’ve moved from prediabetes into actually 
having diabetes. The American Diabetes Association estimates that 57 mil­
lion people have prediabetes, and the majority of them will eventually be 
diagnosed with actual diabetes. Following a low-glycemic diet can help you 
lose weight and decrease your blood sugar levels so you never move into the 
diabetes range. Flip to Chapter 22 if you want more information on the glyce­
mic index and chronic diseases such as diabetes. (Want more info on insulin 
resistance and the glycemic index? Head to Chapter 5.)
	
Individuals with diabetes aren’t the only people who can benefit from using 
the glycemic index to manage blood sugar and insulin levels. Women with 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) also benefit from following a low-glycemic 
diet. Researchers estimate that approximately 25 percent of women of repro­
ductive age have PCOS, a condition that causes insulin resistance. Eating 
low-glycemic foods to reduce blood sugar and insulin levels is one extremely 
effective treatment for PCOS. (Check out Chapter 22 for more about following 
a low-glycemic diet if you have PCOS.)
	
A good nutrition strategy for anyone who wants to lower his blood sugar and 
insulin levels is to first look to the total carbohydrate content in foods. Strive 
to maintain an even carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks. Incorporating 
low-glycemic foods helps provide additional blood sugar–control benefits 
because higher-glycemic foods raise blood sugar levels faster and require 
more insulin to process.
Disease prevention
A large review of 37 scientific studies on the effects of the glycemic index and 
glycemic load on disease prevention shows that following a low-glycemic diet 
independently reduces a person’s risk for Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart 
disease, gallbladder disease, and breast cancer. Choosing a low-glycemic diet 
that’s also high in fiber is even more protective.
Scientists believe that choosing an overall low-glycemic diet that also contains 
protective amounts of vegetables, fruits, and minimally processed whole grains 
appears to protect against heart disease. When it comes to heart disease, 
following the standard recommendations from the American Heart Association 
is crucial: Choose foods that are higher in fiber and monounsaturated fat, 
enjoy seafood that contains beneficial omega-3 fatty acids more often, and 
decrease the amount of saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium 
that you consume. Fortunately, low-glycemic fruits, vegetables, legumes, and 

22
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
whole grains already meet these heart-healthy nutrition guidelines, so simply 
incorporating a variety of these low-glycemic goodies into your diet each day 
can help protect you from heart disease.
The reason for the benefit of a low-glycemic diet rests on lower blood sugar 
levels and a decreased need for insulin. When blood sugar levels increase, 
the body produces more insulin to join with blood sugar and transport it 
into cells to provide energy. At the same time, elevated insulin levels lead to 
inflammation within the blood vessels, and this inflammation plays a role in 
the development of plaque. Plaque inside arteries narrows blood vessels and 
causes them to be less elastic, which can increase blood pressure levels or 
even lead to heart attack or stroke.
	
Heart disease is the culmination of a series of several events. Decreasing your 
risk of heart disease requires an interwoven web of strategies, including using 
the glycemic index within the framework of other nutrition and exercise 
recommendations to promote a healthy heart and cardiovascular system.
Can a low-glycemic diet also help prevent cancer? Scientists know that the 
traditional Mediterranean diet, which is based on vegetables, olive oil, seafood, 
and minimally processed grains, helps prevent several types of cancer. Turns 
out the Mediterranean diet is also a low-glycemic way of eating. Teasing out 
which specific nutrients or eating habits cause or prevent cancer is a complex 
endeavor, and the research often shows conflicting results. Larger long-term 
studies are necessary before scientists can truly understand the role the gly­
cemic index plays in the development of cancer, but right now it’s a good bet 
that choosing a low-glycemic diet, in conjunction with other protective eating 
habits, will give you added protection against developing cancer.
Increased energy
Knowing which foods to eat before, during, and after exercise based on their 
glycemic index level helps athletes maximize their energy and recovery time. 
Even if you’re not a world-class athlete, or even a weekend athlete, under­
standing how the glycemic index of foods affects your energy levels can help 
you stay alert and focused throughout the day. The human body digests 
and metabolizes low-glycemic foods slowly, thereby providing a continued 
amount of energy for working muscles. High-glycemic foods, on the other 
hand, are quickly digested, meaning their carbohydrates are readily available 
to power hard-working muscles.
Start your day with a breakfast that’s built on lower-glycemic foods to pro­
vide longer-lasting energy and wake up your brain. Serve a low-glycemic 
breakfast cereal (such as rolled oats), top it with some fruit, and pour a glass 

23
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Glycemic Index and How to Use It to Lose Weight
of fat-free milk for a balanced, low-glycemic breakfast that’ll give you sustained 
energy throughout the morning. (If you ever wondered why a breakfast of 
sweetened cold cereal and fruit juice led to an energy crash and spike in appe­
tite midmorning, now you know why: You chose higher-glycemic foods, which 
only provide energy for a short period of time.)
Instead of relying on caffeine or high-glycemic processed foods at lunch 
to boost your energy, build a balanced lunch around low-glycemic foods 
such as legume-based soups (lentil, black bean, split pea) or tossed salads 
that include legumes (garbanzo beans, kidney beans, or edamame are great 
choices). Or try spreading hummus on a slice of whole-grain bread topped 
with lean turkey and as many vegetables as you can pile on. You’ll find that 
eating a low-glycemic noontime meal means you don’t find yourself yawning 
and falling asleep midafternoon due to a drop in blood sugar levels. Plus you 
won’t find yourself staring at the vending machine, trying to decide which 
candy bar will give you energy without expanding your waistline.
Improved mood
People really are what they eat in the sense that some foods can build a 
sunny disposition and other foods can bring you down faster than the drop 
of a rollercoaster. One of the most important neurotransmitters that deter­
mines mood is serotonin. High levels of serotonin boost one’s mood, decrease 
food cravings, and promote restful sleep. Low serotonin levels have the 
opposite effect, making you feel tired, cranky, and out of sorts. The amount 
of serotonin in your bloodstream and brain is strongly linked to the foods 
you eat, especially to foods that contain carbohydrates. Once again, the type 
of carbohydrate-containing food you choose is crucial. Eating sugary foods 
when you’re stressed causes a quick release, which feels great at the time 
but not so great when your blood sugar and serotonin levels come crashing 
down shortly afterward.
Does this sound familiar? You’re feeling tired and cranky midmorning at work 
(probably because you skipped breakfast and relied on a sugary coffee to get 
you going) so you grab a donut, bagel, or cookie and drink a sugary beverage 
for energy. You love the quick mental boost, but 30 minutes later you feel 
shaky, tired, and out of sorts — again. You’ve just experienced the effects 
of serotonin levels rising and falling firsthand. Replace those high-glycemic 
foods with low-glycemic choices, however, and you get a slow, sustained 
release of insulin that keeps your blood sugar levels even, followed by a 
gradual rise in serotonin. No rapid rise and no rapid crash of serotonin levels 
means you have a sunny, even mood all morning.

Can you guess the low-glycemic food?
I’ll be honest: Identifying low- and high-glyce­
mic foods just by looking at a list of foods is dif­
ficult. Now that you know some of the basics 
about the glycemic index and how scientists 
calculate it for different foods, here’s a chance 
to test your knowledge. Remember that a food 
with a low glycemic index has a value of 55 or 
less and a food with a high glycemic index has 
a value of 70 or more.

arbohydrates (which are found in foods and aren’t a food group of their 
own) are a big topic in the world of weight loss and health thanks to the 
low-carb craze and today’s numerous modified-carb diets. The problem is not 
all carbs are created equal, so you can’t treat them equally. You’ve probably 
heard or read about simple versus complex carbohydrates, fiber content, 
white versus whole grain, and so on. Throw in the glycemic index and figuring 
out what you’re supposed to focus on for your health gets really confusing!
But it doesn’t have to be that way. Yes, when considering carbs, you need 
to look at many factors, including the glycemic index, nutrients, and fiber. 
However, simple guidelines are available that can help you make the best 
choices for your health — and for successful weight loss.
This chapter presents some basics on what makes carbohydrates differ­
ent and how the glycemic index comes into play so you can make the best 
choices for a healthy low-glycemic diet.
Distinguishing Friendly Carbs from Foes
To better distinguish carbohydrates that can help your diet from those that 
can harm it, you should really know a little basic info about carbs in general. 
Carbohydrates are your body’s major fuel source. They all break down into 

26
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
blood glucose, but they react differently in your body depending on their 
type. Carbs come in two varieties:
	
✓	Simple carbohydrates, which contain one or two sugar units
	
✓	Complex carbohydrates, which contain multiple sugar units
In the past, scientists thought that simple carbohydrates raised blood glu­
cose levels quicker than complex carbohydrates because of the length of the 
sugar units. However, the latest discoveries with the glycemic index show 
that all carbohydrates, simple and complex, vary greatly in regard to their 
blood sugar response.
The glycemic index actually simplifies that technical mumbo jumbo a bit. 
Instead of focusing on complex versus simple carbs to find your best food 
choices for weight loss, you can focus on choosing low-glycemic foods that 
have a high nutrient content. Low-glycemic foods are therefore the new 
“friendly” carbs, and high-glycemic foods are the new “foes.”
	
Most people think of sugar, sweets, or white flour as simple carbohydrates 
that make for unhealthy choices. However, the issue isn’t quite that black and 
white. Consider the case of white flour. Often mistakenly lumped in the simple-
sugars category, white flour is actually a complex carbohydrate, and complex 
carbs are typically labeled as “good carbs.” So not all complex carbs are nec­
essarily the healthiest choices. White flour is an example of a high-glycemic 
“foe,” spiking the blood sugar much higher and faster than its whole-wheat 
counterpart (a low-glycemic “friendly” carb).
You can’t tell what food is friend or foe just by looking. Instead, the food 
must undergo scientific testing to determine how it responds in the body. 
Keep reading to find out how to know which foods are friends and which 
foods are foes.
Measuring a Food’s Glycemic Index
What makes a food low- or high-glycemic? First off, only foods that contain 
carbohydrates can be considered low-, medium-, or high-glycemic. Foods 
such as meats, poultry, fish, and fats (think oil and butter), don’t contain 
carbohydrates, which means you have to rely on your nutrition know-how to 
determine what kinds and how much of them to eat.
The glycemic level of a food measures how fast that food is likely to raise your 
blood sugar. A food that raises your blood sugar quickly is considered high-
glycemic, and a food that raises it slowly is considered low-glycemic. Foods that 
fall somewhere in the middle have (you guessed it) a medium glycemic level.

27
 Chapter 2: All Carbs Aren’t Created Equal
	
Basing food choices solely on the glycemic index can be dangerous because 
that means you’re only looking at one aspect of food and ignoring other impor­
tant ones (such as calories, amount and type of fat, and vitamin and mineral 
content). Many people think that whole grains, fruits, and vegetables naturally 
fall into the low-glycemic category. Although this is true much of the time, it 
isn’t always the case. Some of these foods actually have a high glycemic index, 
and many nonnutritious foods, like certain candies and chips, have a low gly­
cemic index. Don’t simply take the road of “all low-glycemic foods are okay, so 
I can eat as much of them as I want.” That’s what happened during the lowfat 
craze of the ’80s and ’90s. People started eating fat-free everything, even if it 
meant higher sugar and calorie content. The same trend is emerging with low-
glycemic foods; don’t give in to it!
	
The glycemic index is a great tool, but you also need to make sure you’re 
eating nutritious foods most of the time and not filling up on candy and chips 
just because they’re low-glycemic. Don’t toss everything you know about good 
nutrition out the window.
The next sections help you understand how scientists calculate the glycemic 
index and explain a few of the resulting caveats.
Comparing foods to pure 
sugar with human help
Because the glycemic index deals with your blood sugar’s reaction to various 
foods, determining a particular food’s glycemic index calls for the help of human 
test subjects. First, researchers feed 50 grams of available carbohydrates (that’s 
total carbohydrate minus fiber) to ten or more volunteers to test how the food 
raises blood sugar levels at different intervals over a two-hour period after it’s 
consumed. They then plot these changes in blood sugar on a graph and compare 
the volunteers’ responses to the test carbohydrate to their responses to the 
same amount of pure sugar or white bread. The average blood sugar response 
of all ten volunteers compared to their response to sugar or white bread deter­
mines the glycemic index of that food item.
	
Researchers use pure sugar for comparison purposes because it’s the simple 
form of energy used by the human body. However, because most people don’t 
typically eat sugar all by itself, researchers have also been known to use white 
bread for comparison purposes.
Figure 2-1 demonstrates the sharp rise in blood sugar response when pure 
sugar is consumed. You can see the quick rise and the ensuing drop over 
time. Notice that the maximum blood sugar spike occurs around 45 minutes. 
After this peak, the blood sugar levels drop quickly.

Figure 2-2 shows what happens when a high-glycemic food is consumed. The 
rise is similar to what you see in Figure 2-1, but this high-glycemic food falls a 
little short of the curve set in the pure sugar test. The maximum blood sugar 
spike from a high-glycemic food occurs around 45 minutes after food con­
sumption, with a fairly quick drop afterward.

Figure 2-3 shows the difference in the curve when a low-glycemic food is 
eaten. Notice that the maximum spike is much lower and also occurs much 
later, around an hour after consumption with a slow drop back to the base 
line. This type of blood sugar response results in lower levels of insulin being 
released and better control of food cravings, hunger, and mood.

Keeping a couple limitations in mind
As great as the glycemic index is, it does have a couple limitations due to 
how it’s measured. I bet you notice these differences as you begin coming 
across the various glycemic lists that are out there.
	
✓	The lists are limited. Glycemic index testing has only been around 
about 20 years, and it isn’t required by federal guidelines in the United 
States. The process is quite costly and time consuming because each 
variation must be tested. Also, only a small number of researchers actu­
ally conduct glycemic index testing, and they can’t possibly keep up 
with the thousands of new food products that manufacturers develop 
each year. Consequently, many foods haven’t been tested and are there­
fore missing from glycemic index lists.
	
✓	The findings vary. The glycemic index must be measured by observ­
ing humans (specifically their blood sugar’s response to foods; see the 
preceding section), and no two humans are alike. That means the rate at 
which people digest carbohydrates, their insulin response, and even the 
time of day that they’re tested can cause variation. Therefore, each food 
must be tested by a group of people, and the results must be averaged 
together.
	
	Also, there’s a lot of variability in the food world, which means inevita­
bly all glycemic index charts aren’t going to be the same. For example, 
you may find one long-grain rice with a glycemic index of 62 and another 
with a level of 68. These differences may result from the grains being 
grown in different regions, the length of time they were cooked, how 
they were cooked, and so on.

30
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
	The important factor to focus on is whether the food generally ends up 
high, medium, or low on the glycemic index. Don’t get too caught up in 
small number discrepancies among different glycemic index charts.
Defining Low-, Medium-, 
and High-Glycemic Foods
Determining whether a food is high- or low-glycemic is pretty straightfor­
ward. The glycemic index is broken into high-, medium-, and low-glycemic 
foods. High-glycemic-index foods have the quickest blood sugar response; 
low-glycemic-index foods have the slowest. Here are the measurements on a 
scale of 0 to 100:
	
✓	Low glycemic index: 55 or less
	
✓	Medium glycemic index: 56 to 69
	
✓	High glycemic index: 70 or greater
	
Keep in mind that high-glycemic foods aren’t necessarily unhealthy foods. 
Similarly, low-glycemic foods aren’t always healthy. The glycemic index simply 
lets you know how quickly your blood sugar will rise from eating that food.
	
The goal for weight loss on the glycemic index diet is to consume mostly 
nutritious low-glycemic foods and incorporate medium- and high-glycemic 
foods rarely. (Consuming a high-glycemic food once in a while isn’t going to 
make you gain weight overnight, so you do have some flexibility; Chapter 9 
goes into more detail on the concept of moderation.)
Table 2-1 shows you the glycemic index numbers and measurements of some 
popular foods. As you can see, some foods fall right into line with what you 
may have thought about them. For example, brown rice is a low-glycemic 
food, and basmati white rice and spaghetti are medium-glycemic foods. But 
it’s not always that clear-cut. Notice how jasmine rice has a significantly 
higher glycemic index number than basmati rice even though both types of 
rice are white? This is where specific types of products vary. Even though 
foods of the same type may appear the same, each variety can produce a dif­
ferent blood sugar response for many reasons (the very nature and origin of 
the food may be different, people may prepare it differently, and so on).

According to Table 2-1, Peanut M&M’s and Snickers bars have the lowest gly­
cemic content, whereas baked potatoes and watermelons have some of the 
highest. (No, candy isn’t suddenly healthier for you than a potato or fruit.) 
Labeling baked potatoes and watermelons as “bad for you” is a little unfair 
because they’re high in many different vitamins, minerals, and fiber. At the 
same time, you don’t want to assume that certain candy is great for you so 
you can eat as much as you want. That’s certainly rather tempting if you just 
go by the glycemic index numbers, but doing so will get you into trouble fast 
with your overall health and weight-loss goals!
	
Try prioritizing. First, focus on the basics of healthy eating. In other words, 
make sure you’re eating a balanced diet that features lots of fruits and veg­
etables, high-fiber starches, lean meats, and healthy fats. Next, for the foods 
that contain carbohydrates, choose those that are low-glycemic. (Because you 
can’t tell low-glycemic foods from high-glycemic ones just by looking at them, 
use Appendix A as a helpful guide.) Then to lose weight or maintain your 
weight, pay attention to portion size. After all, even too much of a good thing 
can be bad!
Seeing How Fiber Fits into the Mix
What’s a section about fiber doing in a chapter on carbohydrates? Trust me, 
there’s a definite method to the seeming madness. Turns out fiber is really 

32
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
just a term for complex carbohydrates that your body can’t break down. Not 
only that, it’s one of the most influential nutrition players for both weight 
loss and blood sugar control.
Plants use fiber for their shape and structure. In fact, fiber is what gives spin­
ach its hearty stems. For humans, fiber can have many added health benefits, 
including heart health and intestinal health. The following sections reveal 
how fiber fits into your weight-loss plan.
Fiber and blood sugar control
Following a low-glycemic diet is about managing your blood sugar so you avoid 
large insulin spikes throughout the day. Fiber is a natural part of this process. 
Along with its other weight-loss benefits, fiber helps control the rise of blood 
sugar in your body after a meal. This effect is found specifically in soluble fiber, 
which dissolves and becomes gummy. Soluble fiber is also great at reducing 
cholesterol levels. Insoluble fiber, which people often consider “roughage,” is 
also beneficial. It works as an appetite suppressant, slows the rate that blood 
accepts the blood glucose that’s formed from digested sugars and starches, 
prevents constipation, and decreases your risk for bowel diseases.
	
In some cases, diabetics have been able to come off of medication because a 
high-fiber diet was enough to control their blood sugar. Additionally, The New 
England Journal of Medicine noted that diabetics who ate about 50 grams of 
fiber had much improved blood sugar control. Pretty impressive for a food 
you don’t even digest, huh?
	
Clearly fiber is an important part of your overall weight-loss plan. You should 
try to consume 20 to 35 grams of fiber per day, including at least one to two 
servings of soluble fiber. This means eating about five servings of fruits and 
vegetables, three servings of whole grains, and one serving of legumes each 
day. Following are some specific foods that are high in both soluble and insol­
uble fiber (be sure to add ’em to your shopping list):
	
✓	Soluble-fiber foods: Beans, peas, oats, barley, flaxseeds, and many fruits 
and vegetables (such as apples, oranges, and carrots).
	
✓	Insoluble-fiber foods: Whole-wheat bread or pasta, corn bran, and many 
vegetables (such as green beans, cauliflower, and potatoes). The tough, 
chewy texture of these foods comes from the fiber itself.
	
The fiber content of vegetables and fruits varies considerably. For example, 
applesauce doesn’t give you as much fiber as an apple with the skin on. 
Similarly, a large bowl of salad using only Romaine lettuce has around 1 gram 
of fiber compared to almost 4 grams of fiber for 1 cup of boiled collard greens. 

33
 Chapter 2: All Carbs Aren’t Created Equal
This simple fact is why aiming for a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, and 
grains is the way to go.
Low-glycemic/high-fiber, a 
winning combination
Fiber is an excellent weight-loss tool — in fact, it’s one of the most important 
weapons in your weight-loss arsenal. The beauty of fiber is that it has no 
calories. Nada. Zero. Zilch. Why? Because your body can’t digest or absorb 
it. This lovely fact of nature means fiber adds more volume and bulk to your 
meals for fewer total calories. Fiber’s bulk also helps you stay full for a longer 
period of time. When you chow down on foods that are low-glycemic and 
high in fiber, you’re getting the best of both worlds.
The next sections explain the weight-loss benefits of this winning combina­
tion, highlight some low-glycemic/high-fiber foods worth trying, and illustrate 
how to incorporate these foods into your meals.
Checking out what the low-glycemic/high-fiber combo can do for you
Choosing foods that are low-glycemic and high in fiber is your secret weapon 
for weight loss. This power-duo combination adds up to
	
✓	Lower blood sugar and insulin spikes
	
✓	Controlled food cravings
	
✓	A longer-lasting “full” feeling
	
✓	Fewer calories and more volume consumed
Low-glycemic doesn’t always mean high fiber
It should go without saying that all low-glycemic 
foods must be high in fiber . . . right? Well, not 
exactly. You can easily assume that all high-
fiber foods are low-glycemic. However, some 
foods (such as Peanut M&M’s) are low in fiber 
but have a lower glycemic index than say, pota­
toes, which are high in fiber. Even though fiber 
is a strong component in controlling blood sugar 
spikes after a meal, no one quite knows why.
The glycemic index is all about accounting 
for the food as a whole and its effect on blood 
sugar, not specifically measuring fiber. Expect 
to find a mix of fiber content when looking at 
low-glycemic foods. For example, potatoes are 
high in fiber, 4.6 grams for a baked potato with 
skin, yet they wind up being a high-glycemic 
food. Fortunately, most vegetables, fruits, and 
beans end up as low-glycemic, making life 
much easier!

34
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
So how to make sure you’re getting enough fiber out of the large variety of 
low-glycemic fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains you’re eating? Good 
news! You don’t need to mess with counting fiber grams. Instead, just aim for 
the following:
	
✓	Three or more servings of vegetables each day
	
✓	Two or more servings of fruits each day
	
✓	Three or more servings of whole grains each day (out of your total 
grain intake)
	
✓	One or more servings of legumes (beans, peas, and lentils) each day

Pointers for fiber newbies
If you aren’t used to eating a high-fiber diet, or 
if you plan on increasing your fiber intake, you 
should keep a few key things in mind:
	✓	Drink eight to ten glasses of water a day. 
Fiber holds onto water like a sponge as it 
“sweeps” your intestinal track, so keeping 
up with your daily water intake helps fiber 
work more efficiently. An added bonus: 
Drinking enough water helps you avoid 
feeling gassy or bloated.
	✓	Ease into fiber instead of jumping in all 
at once. If you’re only eating an average 
of about 10 grams of fiber a day, you’ll feel 
gassy and bloated if you suddenly increase 
your fiber intake to 35 grams. Gradually 
start eating more fiber over the course of a 
week and see how you feel.
	✓	Note that a significant amount of high-fiber 
foods can fill children up quickly. Although 
fiber is an important part of a child’s diet, 
you should make sure she doesn’t end up 
eating too few calories because she feels 
full from too much fiber. A high-fiber diet is 
good for adults who want to lose weight, 
but it may affect growing children differ­
ently.
	✓	Check with your doctor if you’ve had 
any intestinal issues or gastrointestinal 
surgery. In either case, increasing your 
fiber intake may have undesirable con­
sequences for you, so talk to your doctor 
before pumping up your fiber servings.

36
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
To create similar meal plans on your own, cross-reference your fruit and 
veggie choices with a glycemic index chart to make sure the foods you’re 
picking are low-glycemic as well as high in fiber. Then think of a way to add 
a serving of legumes into your day (perhaps by tossing a cup of beans into 
your lunchtime salad). Finally, as you’re choosing your whole grains, remem­
ber this rule of thumb: the higher the fiber (generally) the better.
Not really sure how to incorporate more low-glycemic foods into your diet? 
Check out Chapter 7 for some ideas. Also take a look at Chapter 15, which 
provides some simple recipe makeovers to illustrate how high-glycemic 
meals can become lower-glycemic ones with a few basic swaps.

A
 quick search for “low-glycemic diet” on the Internet tells you that 
this diet is being used for weight loss in everything from fad diets to 
hospital-based programs. Conflicting information can leave you wondering 
whether a low-glycemic diet is just another fad or a legitimate, evidence-
based piece of the weight-loss puzzle. This chapter highlights several reasons 
why and how a low-glycemic diet works for weight loss as part of a complete 
dietary plan — one that includes calorie control, lots of fruits and veggies, 
and an appropriate intake of healthy fat and lean protein as well.
Regulating Insulin and Blood Glucose
A low-glycemic diet helps regulate insulin and blood glucose levels that become 
unstable due to either a health condition or consumption of an excess amount 
of carbohydrate calories. Anytime you eat foods containing carbohydrates, your 
body naturally breaks those carbs down into blood glucose (blood sugar), 
releasing insulin in the process. Insulin acts like a key that unlocks your cells’ 
doors to allow blood glucose to enter in and provide your cells with energy 
(see Figure 3-1).
Even though insulin transports blood glucose to your cells, your body 
doesn’t turn all of that blood glucose into energy at once. When blood glu­
cose levels rise above normal, insulin signals your liver, muscles, and other 
cells to store the extra. Some of this excess blood glucose gets stored in your 
muscles and liver as glycogen, and some of it gets converted to body fat.

38
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Regardless of whether blood glucose is being spent or stored, the influx of 
blood glucose in your blood can create spikes and crashes depending on 
what you eat. This process leads to food cravings, moodiness, and fatigue — 
all of which can make weight loss difficult to accomplish.
In the next sections, I explain how following a low-glycemic diet can reduce the 
excess fat your body may be storing and positively affect your food cravings.

Keeping blood glucose levels down
Low-glycemic foods play an important role in keeping blood glucose levels 
down. Your body coverts these foods into blood glucose more slowly and 
over a longer period of time. That means your body needs less insulin to 
get the energy into your cells, so your pancreas is spared from being over­
worked. It also means there’s less excess insulin just hanging around as fat 
storage. That’s a plus for weight loss if I ever heard one!
High-glycemic foods, on the other hand, get converted to blood glucose very 
quickly, causing a rush of blood glucose into the body in large amounts. The 
result? You feel satisfied and revived for about 30 minutes following a high-
glycemic snack, but after those 30 minutes are up, you start to feel fatigued 
and hungry all over again. Eating more low-glycemic foods helps reduce 
fatigue and hunger and prevent chronic high blood sugars.

39
 Chapter 3: Why and How a Low-Glycemic Diet Works for Weight Loss
Counteracting insulin resistance
Extra blood glucose (blood sugar) typically gets 
converted to body fat when you’ve eaten too 
many calories. Although this process happens 
to everyone, it may be more challenging for 
individuals with insulin resistance, a condition 
in which a person has a diminished ability for 
his blood glucose to respond to the action of 
insulin, causing the pancreas to secrete even 
more insulin to compensate (see the following 
figure). Many individuals, particularly those with 
prediabetes, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, have some varying 
degree of insulin resistance, which causes their 
bodies to store more calories as fat when their 
insulin levels are consistently high.
Warning: If you’re overweight, you may have a 
small amount of insulin resistance without even 
knowing it. Individuals who are overweight, espe­
cially those who carry a lot of belly weight around 
the middle, are at a higher risk for being insulin 
resistant, a fact that explains why weight loss can 
be a little more challenging for these folks.
Researchers are currently studying the 
effects of a low-glycemic diet to see whether 
it enhances weight loss by helping individuals 
have better control over their blood glucose 
levels. Although many studies show promise, 
the official verdict is still out. No study has con­
sistently shown that a low-glycemic diet helps 
healthy people lose more weight than your aver­
age calorie-restricted diet. This fact just means 
more research is needed, especially among 
people who have known insulin resistance.

What’s wrong with chronically elevated blood sugars? Over time, too much 
sugar in the blood for too long can damage the blood vessels and nerves, leading 
to kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, heart disease, and foot problems.
Controlling food cravings
Food cravings occur for many reasons, both physiological and psychological, 
but one core cause of food cravings is erratic blood glucose levels. When your 
body’s blood glucose levels go through high spikes throughout the day, you 
can wind up feeling hungry — hence the unwanted yet nagging food craving.
Imagine facing a busy day at work and getting the kids off to various appoint­
ments. You don’t have time for more than a couple handfuls of pretzels as 
you race from work to pick up your kids. Even if this was an adequate snack 
calorie-wise, you’d likely feel starving in an hour or so. Why? Because pret­
zels are a high-glycemic snack that sends your blood glucose levels spiking 
only to drop off quickly shortly afterward.
Often food cravings go hand in hand with low blood glucose levels. Rather 
than wanting a healthy snack, you may be craving something sweet or 
starchy as your body tries to compensate for its low blood glucose. This 
cycle occurs daily for many people, and it’s not just limited to snack time. 
Breakfasts, lunches, and dinners that are overloaded with high-glycemic 
foods can also send your blood glucose levels sky-high.
	
To keep your food cravings under control, follow these two simple steps:
	
✓	Choose low-glycemic foods for your meals and snacks. (Refer to 
Appendix A to determine which foods are low-glycemic.)
	
✓	Match these foods with protein and fat sources.
In the earlier pretzel example, a better snack choice would’ve been an apple 
with an ounce of nuts. The apple is a lower-glycemic choice that creates a 
slower blood glucose response in the body. Balancing protein and fat with 
the nuts helps you feel fuller for longer so you don’t need to raid the refrig­
erator for high-sugar snack foods when you get home. (See the later “Eating 
More of the Right Foods to Lose More Weight” section for more on the 
weight-loss benefits of a little protein and fat.)

What about supplements for 
blood glucose control?
Many supplements that tout better blood 
glucose control are currently on the market, but 
do they really work? That’s the question. This 
sidebar presents a quick summary of some 
popular supplements so you can make the best 
decision about whether they’re right for you. 
Remember: Even a “natural” supplement can 
interfere with some health conditions and medi­
cations, so talk with your doctor before trying 
any of the following supplements:
	✓	Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant 
that protects against cell damage. It’s 
found in foods such as broccoli, spinach, 
and liver. ALA has been researched for 
its effect on insulin sensitivity and blood 
glucose metabolism. Some studies show 
benefits, but more research is needed to 
confirm these findings.
	✓	Chromium is an essential trace mineral 
that the body needs to function properly. 
It’s found in meats, whole-grain prod­
ucts, fruits, vegetables, and some spices. 
Chromium supplementation has been stud­
ied for its effect on blood glucose control. 
Although it’s a fairly popular supplement, 
the research findings have been mixed, and 
some studies have been poorly designed. 
More high-quality research is needed to 
fully understand chromium’s effect on 
blood glucose control. Warning: Chromium 
in high doses can lead to kidney problems. 
Be sure to talk to your doctor before taking 
these supplements to guarantee you’re 
taking the proper dosage.
	✓	Omega-3 fatty acids are fatty acids that 
come from fish, canola oil, and walnuts. 
So far little evidence shows that omega-3s 
have an effect on blood glucose, but there 
is significant research on omega-3s’ effect 
on heart health and depression. Consuming 
fish two to three times a week will give you 
an adequate supply of omega-3s, but low- 
to medium-dose supplementation is also a 
safe choice. Just be sure your fish oil sup­
plements have good quality control so they 
aren’t contaminated with mercury or PCBs. 
Warning: Fish oil can be a blood thinner, so 
talk to your doctor if you’re taking medica­
tion that may interact with it.
	✓	Cinnamon is a commonly used spice. The 
active ingredient, hydroxychalcone, may 
enhance the effect of insulin, helping to 
promote blood glucose uptake into cells 
and tissues. Although some studies show 
that cinnamon has a positive effect on 
blood glucose control, others show no sig­
nificant differences. This is yet another sup­
plement that needs further testing. Cooking 
with cinnamon or drinking cinnamon tea 
is completely safe and a good way to test 
this spice’s effects out on yourself. But be 
careful when using cinnamon supplements 
because many may not be the right type of 
cinnamon and some may interact with cer­
tain medications.

Suppressing Your Appetite Naturally
A low-glycemic diet not only helps you manage blood sugar and insulin levels 
but it also serves as a natural appetite suppressant. Who needs scary over-
the-counter diet pills when you can just use food? Better yet, incorporating 
low-glycemic foods helps you deal with a reduced calorie intake so you don’t 
feel starved all day. The following sections highlight the two main reasons a 
low-glycemic diet can work to control your appetite.
Feeling fuller with fiber
Fiber is nature’s natural appetite suppressant. It provides bulk and slows 
down digestion to help you feel full for a longer period of time. So what does 
fiber have to do with a low-glycemic diet? Well, many low-glycemic foods are 
also higher in fiber.
	
Not all low-glycemic foods are high in fiber, but you may naturally increase 
your fiber intake as you begin following a low-glycemic diet. (To discover 
foods that are both low-glycemic and high in fiber, head to Chapter 2.)
Another reason why fiber makes you feel fuller is that high-fiber foods take 
longer to chew, causing you to take a little longer with your meal. Your brain 
needs 20 minutes before it can register that you’re full, and many people 
can wolf down a second helping before that 20-minute mark is up. High-fiber 
foods take a bit more time to get through.
Bumping up your fullness hormones 
with low-glycemic foods
Appetite is controlled by an intricate dance of hormones that trigger hunger 
and fullness. Have you ever felt that “way too full” feeling for hours after a big 
meal? You know, like when you’ve eaten a huge Thanksgiving dinner and all 
you want to do is curl up on the couch like a beached whale afterward. That 
feeling is the effect of your fullness hormones.
One of these fullness hormones, called GLP-1, has been shown to be of partic­
ular importance in preliminary studies with a low-glycemic diet. GLP-1 is one 
of two hormones that works by telling your brain you’ve had enough. It really 
brings things to a halt by telling your stomach to stop moving anything along 
to your intestines until what’s already there has been broken down.

43
 Chapter 3: Why and How a Low-Glycemic Diet Works for Weight Loss
Early in 2009, researchers from King’s College in London took a closer look 
at GLP-1 in respect to a low-glycemic diet. Volunteers who ate a low-glycemic 
breakfast ended up with 20 percent higher levels of GLP-1 in their blood after­
ward compared to those who ate a high-glycemic breakfast. This preliminary 
study shows a direct correlation between a low-glycemic diet and GLP-1, but 
more research is needed to confirm this finding.
Until that research is available, why not conduct your own experiment? 
Here’s how:
	
1.	Maintain your current diet for several days and keep food records.
	
2.	Rate your level of fullness/satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 
being hungry and 10 being full) two to three hours after a meal or snack.
	
3.	As you begin including more low-glycemic foods in your meals, note 
any differences in your overall hunger/fullness levels.
Combining Low-Glycemic Foods 
with Calorie Awareness
Following a low-glycemic diet isn’t a stand-alone solution for weight loss. Like 
it or not, you still need to pay attention to the amount of calories you take in 
each day.
	
If you eat a low-glycemic diet that’s still high in calories, you aren’t going 
to get very far with your weight-loss goals. A low-glycemic diet is an impor­
tant piece of the weight-loss puzzle, but it’s not the solution to the puzzle. 
Successfully losing weight requires a holistic approach that includes eating a 
combination of low-glycemic carbs, healthy protein, and fats; counting calo­
ries; exercising; and doing what you can to pump up your metabolism.
In the sections that follow, I explain why paying attention to calories is still 
essential on a low-glycemic diet and how to get the most out of your daily 
calorie allotment.
Understanding why calories still count
Calories are always going to be one of the most important aspects of weight 
loss. If you consume more calories than your body can convert into energy, 
your body turns that unspent energy into body fat and stores it somewhere. 

44
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Think of it like a car. Gasoline is similar to calories in that it provides energy 
for the car to function just like calories provide you with the energy you need 
to function. If you fill a car’s gas tank past capacity, the extra gas overflows 
onto the ground. Unfortunately your body’s overflow system doesn’t just 
land on the ground; it winds up on your thighs, your rear, your stomach, and 
wherever else your body deems fit to store fat.
To lose weight effectively, you need to reduce your calorie intake through 
dietary changes and exercise. Table 3-1 gives you an idea of the calorie deficit 
needed to lose a specific amount of weight.
Table 3-1	
Calorie Deficits and Weight Loss
Rate of Weight Loss 
(Pounds Per Week)
Calorie Deficit Per Day 
(from Diet and Exercise)
.5 pound per week
250
1 pound per week
500
1.5 pounds per week
750
2 pounds per week
1,000
	
Cutting back on your calorie intake doesn’t mean you need to diligently count 
calories. Who in his right mind actually wants to do that all day every day? 
Instead, you just need to make small changes that lead to a calorie deficit. 
Adopting a low-glycemic lifestyle is one of those changes because many 
low-glycemic foods are lower in calories. People who start choosing lower-
glycemic foods tend to naturally lower their calorie level without even having 
to think about it.
Following are a few examples of how switching to a low-glycemic diet can 
impact your calorie level:
	
✓	Choosing a side salad with your sandwich rather than a small bag of 
potato chips saves you 50 to 100 calories.
	
✓	Switching from a large bagel (about 4 ounces) with cream cheese for 
breakfast to 1 cup of low-glycemic cereal with milk saves you around 200 
calories.
	
✓	Skipping the baked potato with all the fixings at your steak dinner and 
replacing it with steamed broccoli saves you around 300 calories.
See? Changing even one meal a day to incorporate low-glycemic foods can be 
enough to impact your weight loss each week. These changes may seem small, 
but they add up to big calorie deficits when you stick with them over time.

45
 Chapter 3: Why and How a Low-Glycemic Diet Works for Weight Loss
Knowing that low-glycemic doesn’t 
always mean low-calorie
Although it’d be great if eating low-glycemic foods always resulted in lower 
calorie levels, it doesn’t always work out that way. The calorie deficits you 
experience on a low-glycemic diet really depend on what your diet looked 
like before. If you’re exchanging a lot of unhealthy or high-calorie choices 
for more healthy, low-calorie foods, then yes, you may see a difference in 
your calorie level. However, if you already eat a fairly healthy diet and you’re 
simply replacing your high-glycemic grains and veggies for their lower-
glycemic counterparts, you won’t see much of a difference in your overall 
calorie level. For example, brown rice is lower-glycemic than jasmine rice, 
but both contain the same amount of calories.
Don’t forget that some treats, such as chips and even some types of candy, 
have a lower glycemic index but are still high in calories. For example, Peanut 
M&M’s are low-glycemic, but one package costs you 243 calories — that’s a 
lot for a small treat.
	
Beware of fad diets and messages that simplify the glycemic index diet too 
much. Just because you’re eating low-glycemic foods doesn’t mean you can 
forget all you know about good nutrition. A low-glycemic diet should be 
looked at as a new way to make the best choices for carbohydrate-containing 
foods — not as a stand-alone solution for weight loss. When it comes to 
weight loss, calories still matter.
Keeping portion sizes under control
Even if you’re swapping your favorite high-glycemic foods for healthier low-
glycemic options, if you regularly eat inappropriate portion sizes, you won’t see 
success. I can’t tell you how many times I hear people saying, “As long as it’s low-
glycemic, you can eat as much as you want.” That’s simply not the case.
	
Eating inappropriate portion sizes hurts you in two ways:
	
✓	Low-glycemic foods can become high-glycemic foods if you eat too 
large of a serving. The low-glycemic status of many foods is dependent 
on you consuming the right portion size, meaning if you eat more than 
that amount, your glycemic load will add up. So if you eat two servings 
of pasta rather than one, you wind up with a higher glycemic load for 
that whole meal. (I explain glycemic load in detail in Chapter 4.)
	
✓	More food equals more calories. Adding more calories with large por­
tion sizes will defeat your efforts at weight loss quickly. Whether or not 
your calories are coming primarily from low-glycemic foods, eating too 
many of them raises your insulin levels and causes you to gain weight.

46
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
Portion sizes are probably one of the biggest culprits in weight gain. People 
are eating larger portion sizes than ever these days, a fact that correlates 
directly to the rate of weight gain in many countries.
For some guidance on the appropriate portion sizes for several different 
foods, flip to Chapter 9.
Eating More of the Right Foods 
to Lose More Weight
If you want to keep your body working at peak performance to ensure an 
increased metabolism, improved health, and success with long-term weight 
loss, then you need to make the foods you eat work for you. In other words, 
aim to get the most nutritional bang for each bite. The following sections help 
you pick the foods that can add balance, vitamins, and minerals to your diet.
Choosing lots of fruits and vegetables
Two food groups are generally safe to eat in greater amounts when you want 
to lose weight: vegetables and fruits. These foods (particularly vegetables) 
contain lower calorie levels and lower glycemic loads than most other foods. 
In fact, most vegetables aren’t even measured for their glycemic index/load 
because the amount of carbohydrates in them is so low (approximately 5 
grams on average). As for the calorie factor, a whole cup of raw vegetables or 
a half cup of cooked vegetables is, on average, a mere 25 calories. That’s a lot 
of food for such a small calorie amount! On the fruit side of things, most fruits 
tend to have a low glycemic load, and one small piece averages out to 60 
calories. Sure, that’s not as low as the veggies, but it’s still lower than many 
other food groups.
	
When you want to lose weight, you can choose to either have tiny portion sizes 
of high-glycemic foods or pump up the volume with fruits and vegetables and 
still maintain a lower calorie level. Consider the following calorie information:
1 cup of steamed broccoli = 50 calories
1 cup of fruit = 60 calories
1 cup of pasta = 160 calories
1 cup of ice cream = 340 calories

47
 Chapter 3: Why and How a Low-Glycemic Diet Works for Weight Loss
As you can see, for the same volume of food, you can consume far fewer 
calories by eating more fruits and vegetables. The beauty is that most of the 
foods in these two food groups end up on the low-glycemic food list! (See for 
yourself in Appendix A.)
The following examples illustrate how you can cut the calorie level of your 
dinner and dessert with some simple, low-glycemic food swaps:
Dinner
Grilled garlic chicken served over 11⁄2 cups of pasta = 345 calories
Grilled garlic chicken served over 1⁄2 cup of pasta with 1 cup of broccoli, 
red pepper, and snow peas = 235 calories
Total savings: 110 calories
Dessert
1 cup of ice cream with chocolate sauce = 440 calories
1⁄2 cup of ice cream with 1⁄2 cup of fresh strawberries = 230 calories
Total savings: 210 calories
By incorporating more low-glycemic fruits and veggies, you get the same 
volume of food on your plate but with fewer calories, a lower glycemic load, 
more fiber, and more nutrients. Not bad for a simple switch!
	
You can also use vegetables and fruits to increase your overall volume of 
food for the calorie level. For example, you can have a large salad with 3 cups 
of mixed greens plus 1 cup of assorted veggies (including tomatoes, peppers, 
and cucumbers) with grilled chicken and light vinaigrette dressing for around 
250 calories. Compare this meal to the grilled chicken over 11⁄2 cups of pasta for 
345 calories. You get around 41⁄2 cups of food for the salad meal compared to 
around 2 cups of food for the pasta and chicken dish. Eating more vegetables 
and fruits at a meal means you can have more food for fewer calories. That’s a 
great plan if you ask me!
Including healthy fats and protein
Of course, you can’t pursue weight loss and health without taking a look at 
all the foods you consume, including your protein and fat sources. These are 
two of the nutrients that make up the Big Three of calorie sources (carbohy­
drates being #3). Not only that but they also help you feel full and give you 
long-term energy.

48
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Choosing lean-protein foods is essential for weight loss and general health. 
Some examples of lean-protein sources are skinless chicken breasts, lean cuts 
of beef and pork, egg whites, fish and shellfish, and soy foods. You also need 
to eat fat. Believe it or not, fat is healthy when it’s the right kind and when you 
consume it in moderate amounts. Look for unsaturated fat sources, specifically 
oils, seeds, nuts, nut butters, olives, and avocados. Do your best to avoid satu­
rated and trans fats such as butter, cream, lard, and hydrogenated oils.
	
Consuming a protein source and a fat source at each meal is a great way to 
slow down your body’s digestion and conversion of carbohydrates into sugar 
to provide long-term fullness and nutritional health . . . both of which are keys 
to long-term weight loss!
	
Eating the right amounts of low-glycemic fruits and vegetables along with 
portion-controlled low-glycemic starches is great, but if you’re pairing those 
foods with excessive amounts of butter, oils, or high-fat meats, your hard work 
may all be for naught. Pay attention to your portion sizes. Fats in particular 
are very calorie dense, so keep a close eye on ’em. One teaspoon of oil, 1 
tablespoon of nut butter, or six almonds, for example, is plenty.

Taking Portion Size into Account 
with the Glycemic Load

▶	Determining a particular food’s glycemic load
▶	Using the glycemic load to increase the kinds of foods you can eat
▶	Looking at the glycemic load levels of common foods
T
he glycemic index is a wonderful tool for determining your best 
carbohydrate-containing food choices. But like many things in life, it 
has its limitations, specifically those relating to the amount of food you’d 
actually eat in a serving, mixed foods, and even different food-preparation 
methods. As the glycemic index diet has grown more and more popular, new 
concepts and information are doing their part to lessen the impact of some of 
these limitations.
One such concept is the glycemic load. Although the glycemic index shows 
you the quality of your carbohydrates (as explained in Chapter 2), the gly­
cemic load breaks those carbs down into the quantity you’d typically eat at 
one sitting, which can turn a high-glycemic food into a low-glycemic food. 
Glycemic load is one of the most important concepts to understand so you 
can make the best food choices based on a realistic portion size. That’s why I 
share the basics of it with you in this chapter.
Going from the Glycemic Index 
to the Glycemic Load
The glycemic load, which is based on the idea that a high-glycemic food 
eaten in small quantities produces a blood sugar response that’s similar to 
the response produced by low-glycemic foods, is a much more useful tool 
for your day-to-day use. It allows you to have more food choices than the 

50
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
glycemic index does alone. That’s good news because no one wants to be 
too restricted in what he or she can eat. But to create the glycemic load, 
researchers first had to come up with the glycemic index.
The glycemic index concept was developed in 1981 by two University of 
Toronto researchers, Dr. Thomas Wolever and Dr. David Jenkins. Their 
research compared the effect of 25 grams of carbohydrates (just picture 
two slices of bread if you’re not familiar with the metric system) to that of 
50 grams of carbohydrates (picture four slices of bread) to see whether the 
smaller amount created a lower glycemic response in the human body based 
on the lower quantity of carbohydrates.
However, with the amount of carbohydrates varying so much in different 
foods (for instance, some fruits and vegetables have only 5 grams of carbohy­
drates whereas starches have up to 15 grams), 50 grams of carbohydrates (the 
standard amount used for glycemic index testing) doesn’t always depict the 
portion size a person may typically eat. To account for this variation, in 1997, 
Harvard University’s Dr. Walter Willet created the glycemic load, which calcu­
lates the quality and quantity of carbohydrates at a meal. The fact that the gly­
cemic load takes portion size into account is quite helpful because the average 
person is far less likely to eat 50 grams of a particular food in one sitting.
Looking at portion sizes and carbohydrate grams can give you a better 
understanding of the glycemic load. Although foods vary, Table 4-1 breaks 
down the average amount of carbohydrates in each carbohydrate-containing 
food group based on a particular portion size.
Table 4-1	
Average Carbohydrate Grams in Four Food Groups
Food Group
Carbohydrate 
Grams
Portion Size
Starches
15
1⁄2 cup pasta, 1 slice bread, 1⁄3 cup 
white rice
Fruits
15
1 small piece
Dairy products
12
1 cup milk, 1 cup light yogurt
Nonstarchy vegetables
5
1⁄2 cup cooked, 1 cup raw
As you can see from Table 4-1, the amount of carbohydrates in a serving of 
a particular food depends as much on the portion size as it does on the food 
itself. So consuming 50 grams of carbohydrates (which is definitely more 
than one serving) will have a dramatic impact on your blood sugar. Take car­
rots, for example. Carrots have a high glycemic index when cooked (41 to be 
exact), yet they’re considered a nonstarchy vegetable. To consume 50 grams 
of carbohydrates in carrots, you’d have to eat 5 cups! I don’t know about you, 

51
 Chapter 4: Taking Portion Size into Account with the Glycemic Load
but even though I like carrots, 5 cups is a bit much (not to mention it may 
turn your skin orange). Because the amount of carbohydrates in carrots is so 
low compared to their average portion size, the glycemic load of carrots is 
low as well.
On the other hand, a serving of instant white rice, another high-glycemic 
food with a glycemic index of 72, has around 15 grams of carbohydrates per 
1⁄3-cup serving. To eat 50 grams of carbohydrates in instant white rice, you’d 
have to eat slightly more than 1 cup of rice — a fairly typical portion size for 
most people. This portion size means the glycemic load for instant white rice 
doesn’t change much from the food’s glycemic index.
	
The glycemic index compares the potential of foods with equal amounts of 
carbohydrates to raise blood sugar. The purpose of the glycemic load is to 
have a usable indicator of the glycemic index that takes portion size into 
account. Although adding glycemic load to the mix may cause the glycemic 
index of some foods, such as white rice, to remain the same, it opens up the 
door for enjoying more foods that may have a high glycemic index but a low 
glycemic load based on different portion sizes.
Calculating Glycemic Load
Whereas calculating the glycemic index requires human clinical trials (as 
explained in Chapter 2), the glycemic load is a little simpler to determine. As 
long as you have some key pieces of information, you can calculate the glyce­
mic load number and then see whether that number fits into the low, medium, 
or high category. The next few sections walk you through the basics.
Doing the math
The glycemic load uses a specific calculation. So as long as you know the 
glycemic index of a food and the grams of available carbohydrates (total car­
bohydrate minus fiber) in that food, you can figure out that food’s glycemic 
load. Here’s the calculation:
Glycemic index × Grams of carbohydrates ÷ 100
Try working out the calculation for a 1⁄2-cup serving of raw carrots, which have 
about 8.6 grams of available carbohydrates and a glycemic index of 45. (Note: 
I’ve rounded the numbers for simplicity’s sake. Feel free to do the same in 
your own calculations.)
45 × 8.6 = 387 ÷ 100 = 3.9 glycemic load

52
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Want to calculate the glycemic load of instant white rice instead? Well, a por­
tion size of around 2⁄3 cup of white rice has about 36 grams of available carbo­
hydrates and a glycemic index of 72. Here’s the math:
72 × 36 = 2,592 ÷ 100 = 26 glycemic load
	
To find the amount of available carbohydrates in packaged foods, simply 
check the nutrition facts label. If the food is raw, like carrots or apples, you 
can use Table 4-1 as your reference for estimating the amount of available car­
bohydrates because it gives you the average grams of carbohydrates for the 
listed portions.
Figuring out what the numbers mean
Knowing how to calculate the glycemic load of a food is great, but it’s not 
quite enough. The end measurement is what’s most important to know. 
Similar to the glycemic index, the glycemic load is measured as low, medium, 
and high, rankings that help you determine your best choices for realistic 
portion sizes.
	
The measurements for glycemic load are as follows:
	
✓	Low: 10 or less
	
✓	Medium: 11 to 19
	
✓	High: 20 or more
After you know the glycemic load of a food, think of these rankings and plop 
your food into place. Thanks to the preceding section you know that carrots 
have a glycemic load of 3.9. That’s less than 10, so carrots have a low glyce­
mic load. White rice, with its glycemic load of 26, has a high glycemic load 
because 26 is greater than 20.
	
When you don’t have time to calculate the glycemic load and match it up with 
the right measurement, keep in mind that foods with the least amount of 
carbohydrates (think vegetables and fruits) tend to have a lower glycemic 
load than starchy foods (such as rice and pastas).
Factoring in portion sizes
Perhaps one of the greatest beauties of the glycemic load is that researchers 
have embraced it as the main standard of measurement, which means it’s 
already calculated for you in most any glycemic index list. Three cheers for 
not having to drag a calculator with you everywhere you go! The variable in 

53
 Chapter 4: Taking Portion Size into Account with the Glycemic Load
this info, however, is portion size. If you’re eating more or less than the por­
tion size stated in the list you’re looking at, you need to account for possible 
fluctuations in the glycemic load.
To better see what I mean, consider the following different portion sizes of 
jasmine rice:
Portion Size
Glycemic Load
1⁄2 cup
35
2⁄3 cup
46
1 cup
70
You can clearly see how the different portion sizes have a dramatic impact 
on the glycemic load. The higher the portion size, the greater the glycemic 
load will be. You can also see that, regardless of the calculation, the glycemic 
load for jasmine rice is so high that this food item isn’t going to dip into the 
medium or low category very easily.
To see what happens in the case of a food that borders on being low-glycemic, 
take a look at brown rice, which has a glycemic index of 50:
Portion Size
Glycemic Load
1⁄2 cup
12.5
2⁄3 cup
16
1 cup
26
The smaller portion size still doesn’t bring the glycemic load of brown rice 
down to a low level, but it does keep it within the medium range. Increasing 
the portion size raises the glycemic load to the high level.
Last but not least, check out what happens to the glycemic load when you 
play with the portion size of a low-glycemic food such as kidney beans, which 
have a glycemic index of 34:
Portion Size
Glycemic Load
1⁄2 cup
6
2⁄3 cup
7
1 cup
13
In this case, the two smaller portion sizes fall into a low glycemic load, and 
the larger one moves into the medium range.
I’ve shown you these three examples so you can see exactly how portion size 
affects glycemic load, but I promise I won’t make you do math every time 

54
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
you eat! Just knowing the portion size used in Appendix A’s list will help you 
determine how much to eat. If the portion used is 2⁄3 cup and that food ends 
up being low-glycemic, you know you can easily eat that amount or less.
	
Of course, determining glycemic load based on portion size isn’t an exact 
science, so sticking to low- to medium-glycemic foods within a reasonable 
amount is just fine. The beauty of this tactic for weight loss is that it keeps you 
eating portion sizes within a good calorie range. Limiting your rice servings to 
1⁄3 to 2⁄3 of a cup is a great place to be. If you increase that portion size to 1 to 
2 cups, then you begin to not only increase your glycemic load but also your 
calorie intake.
Embracing High-GI/Low-GL Foods
In the early days of the glycemic index’s popularity, experts appeared on 
television screens next to a table full of foods, talking about which ones were 
good and which ones were bad. Almost always they came to high-glycemic 
foods such as potatoes and watermelon and announced them as being equiv­
alent to pure sugar. First of all . . . of course foods that contain mostly carbo­
hydrates are all sugar . . . all carbohydrates break down into sugar, so that’s a 
bit of an unfair comment to begin with. But in the experts’ defense, they were 
operating with the glycemic index alone.
Thanks to the glycemic load, carrots and other high-glycemic fruits and veg­
gies that got such a bad rap aren’t considered so bad for you anymore. That’s 
a darn good thing in my book because those same fruits and veggies are 
loaded with important nutrients.
What should my daily glycemic load be?
You don’t want to get so bogged down 
with numbers that you avoid carbohydrate-
containing foods altogether; that’s neither a 
healthy choice nor one that promotes weight 
loss. To keep yourself on track for weight loss, 
your glycemic load for the day should be no 
less than 60 and no greater than 80. (Staying 
within the 80 to 120 range is ideal for weight 
maintenance.) Spread this out throughout the 
day to balance the glycemic load of all of your 
meals and snacks, aiming for a glycemic load of 
around 20 per meal.
To lower your daily glycemic load, try
	✓	Increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, 
nuts, and legumes
	✓	Monitoring portion sizes of high-glycemic, 
starchy foods (such as white rice, pasta, and 
white breads) as well as sweets and sugars

 Chapter 4: Taking Portion Size into Account with the Glycemic Load
If you’re one of those people following the old rules, or if you’ve been leery of 
following a low-glycemic diet because it puts certain foods such as watermel­
ons in the “bad” category, I’m happy to tell you to take these foods off of your 
taboo list. The following foods not only have a low glycemic load but are also 
healthy, low-calorie choices:
	
✓	Cantaloupe (GI 65; GL 4): This fruit offers a full array of nutrients, 
including vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and fiber.
	
✓	Papaya (GI 59; GL 10): This incredible fruit that you may not have eaten 
much has a rich, tropical taste and is high in vitamin A, vitamin C, potas­
sium, folate, magnesium, and fiber.
	
✓	Pineapple (GI 59; GL 7): Being a tropical fruit, pineapple is naturally 
loaded with vitamin C, but it also contains a special substance called 
bromelain, which has shown potential as an anti-inflammatory as well as 
a digestive aid.
	
✓	Pumpkin (GI 75; GL 3): I’m happy to report that you can safely include 
pumpkin in your glycemic index diet thanks to its low glycemic load of 3. 
This food is an excellent source of vitamins A and C as well as fiber. It’s 
also wonderfully sweet and can be used in everything from soups to 
healthy desserts. (Head to Chapter 19 for a to-die-for Crustless Pumpkin 
Pie recipe.)
	
✓	Watermelon (GI 72; GL 4): This delicious summer fruit may at first look 
like a high-glycemic food with its glycemic index of 72, but it actually has 
a very low glycemic load. Why? Because it’s made up of a lot of water, 
hence the name. Watermelon is also loaded in antioxidants with high 
levels of both vitamin C and vitamin A. It also contains lycopene, which 
is shown to be helpful for heart health.
	
When you take glycemic load into account, you find that nearly all fruits and 
vegetables are acceptable on your low-glycemic diet. This is an important real­
ization because fruits and veggies (which are naturally low in calories) also 
provide the majority of nutrients and fiber in your diet. Including five to nine 
servings of fruits and vegetables in your diet will help you lose weight in a way 
that you can eat plenty of food and not starve yourself!
Checking Out How Glycemic Load 
Varies among Popular Foods
The information in this section is designed to provide you with some insight 
into how the glycemic load varies among popular food choices. As you 
can see in Table 4-2, fruits and vegetables typically end up on the low end 

56
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
whereas the more starchy foods, such as potatoes, rice, and pasta, end up on 
the medium to high end.
	
Your goal is to pick low- to medium-glycemic foods most of the time.

Notice the different portion sizes and their glycemic load measurement. 
Some foods are clearly a slam dunk as far as being a healthy choice, but 
others are a little gray. For example, if you look at spaghetti, you see that 
it has a medium glycemic load for a portion size of ¾ of a cup. Spaghetti is 
therefore fine to eat in that amount, or you can even lower the glycemic load 
a little by eating just 1⁄2 of a cup. But if you go over the 3⁄4-cup portion size, 
you’re entering into high-glycemic territory.
If the idea of portion size’s effect on glycemic load still seems confusing, 
don’t get discouraged in your efforts to understand it. I promise that after a 
while you’ll get the hang of looking at the glycemic load of a food compared 
to just its portion size.

Determining How Going Low-
Glycemic Can Work for You
In This Chapter
▶	Reflecting on the amount of weight you want to lose
▶	Reviewing your dieting history to see how to make your new lifestyle choices stick
▶	Determining whether you have insulin resistance
▶	Discovering the benefits of a low-glycemic diet for people in different stages of life
W
hatever your dietary goals may be, the low-glycemic diet is showing pos­
itive results not only with weight loss but also with disease prevention/
management and healthier lifestyles. Plus, it’s an easy diet. After you have 
the basic concepts down, it becomes a moderate dietary plan that you can 
follow for the long haul. That means no more yo-yo dieting or continuously 
going “on” and “off” a ridiculously restrictive diet. Those short-term fixes 
aren’t the real answer to weight loss or a healthy lifestyle. A low-glycemic 
diet is. That’s why this chapter is all about how to incorporate a healthy low-
glycemic diet into your life.
Considering Your Weight-Loss Goals
Before you dive into living a low-glycemic lifestyle, you really need to consider 
your weight-loss goals. Do you want and/or need to lose 5 to 10 pounds or 
more than 30 pounds? Following a low-glycemic diet can work well in either 
case. However, it’s important to note that no matter how much weight you 
want or need to lose, the low-glycemic diet is more of a lifestyle change than 
a strict diet regimen. It’s about making the best carbohydrate-containing food 
choices. With this information in mind, you may need to adjust your expecta­
tions regarding weight loss. The following sections can help you do that by 
getting you familiar with the idea of truly healthy weight loss and by compar­
ing two different weight-loss approaches.

60
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Defining healthy weight loss
Healthy weight loss is slow weight loss, plain and simple. Losing weight 
gradually (not rapidly like you might on a strict, very-low-calorie diet) helps 
ensure you can maintain that weight loss for the long term. Think about the 
rate at which you gain weight. You usually don’t gain 30 pounds in six weeks. 
Instead, you gain weight gradually over time. The process for losing that 
weight works exactly the same way.
	
Good expectations for healthy weight loss include the following:
	
✓	You may not lose any weight for the first two weeks. During this 
time, you’re really just figuring out your desired dietary changes; 
implementation of them may not happen overnight. I know you want 
to lose weight fast. That’s a given. However, fast weight loss often goes 
hand in hand with a diet regimen that you can’t stick to long term. 
Remember the old fable of the tortoise and the hare? Slow but steady 
wins the weight-loss race too.
	
✓	After the first two weeks, you’ll start to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. 
This is a moderate rate of weight loss that indicates you’re losing body 
fat and not muscle. It takes into consideration that with exercise you’ll 
actually be increasing your muscle mass. So if you lose a pound of fat, 
you may also gain a pound of muscle, which means the scale won’t tip 
drastically. Gaining muscle is a good thing because it helps increase 
your metabolism and gives your body a nice shape.
	
✓	You may lose a lot of fluid weight right away. The human body is 
made up mainly of water, and your water weight can fluctuate quite a bit 
based on your hydration, sodium intake, medicines, and other factors. 
You may celebrate if you lose 5 to 6 pounds in your first week on a low-
glycemic diet, but keep in mind that some of that lost weight may have 
been fluid weight, not just body fat. However, that’s still good because 
you don’t need that extra fluid on you. Just don’t get discouraged if your 
weight loss slows down in the following weeks.
	
✓	You may not lose weight every week. Don’t fret if the scale shows the 
same weight for a few weeks in a row. The reason may simply be that you 
haven’t created enough of a calorie deficit with the dietary and exercise 
changes you’re making. Review your food journal (see Chapter 6 for how 
to create one if you haven’t already) to evaluate how you’re doing with 
your changes and see whether you can make adjustments in some areas.
I bet this isn’t exactly the news you were hoping for. After all, when you want 
to lose weight, you want immediate results. Following a low-glycemic diet 
will help you lose weight, especially if you have insulin resistance (see the 
later “Do You Have Insulin Resistance?” section for more on this condition). 
However, slower weight loss simply makes sense when you look at the big 
picture.

61
 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
Here are the facts: It takes 3,500 calories to lose 1 pound of body fat, and 
consuming low-glycemic foods helps ensure you don’t store more calories as 
fat than necessary. So in order to lose 2 pounds a week, you have to make a 
1,000-calorie deficit every single day. For most folks, creating a 1,000-calorie 
deficit requires immediate and drastic changes to their diet and exercise 
every day. (Note that it takes about six weeks of consistent exercise before 
you begin to see changes in your body shape.) They may decide to turn to 
one of the many very-low-calorie diet programs out there in order to achieve 
that 1,000-calorie deficit. However, consuming too few calories on a regular 
basis may decrease your metabolism (check out Chapter 8 to discover other 
factors affecting metabolism). Plus, that’s just tough to live with long term.
The majority of people gradually enter into a diet program and aren’t always 
consistent in the beginning. That’s a normal part of making changes and is 
perfectly okay, but it also means that expecting to see major results in the 
first few weeks of any diet isn’t very realistic.
	
Just because you don’t see immediate results doesn’t mean your weight-loss 
efforts aren’t working. You’re just creating a smaller calorie deficit each day; 
that deficit will still lead to weight loss but over a longer period of time.
Reviewing the pros and cons of different 
approaches to weight loss
The following sections break down the pros and cons of taking a fast, aggres­
sive approach to weight loss versus a slow and steady one. There’s no right 
or wrong answer here; the goal is simply to become aware of how these two 
weight-loss approaches work. If you want a better long-term success rate, 
then allow yourself some time to make lifestyle changes that will stick. If you 
want to see quicker results, you absolutely can. Just be prepared to work a 
little harder and commit to long-term changes.
	
If you have medical issues and your doctor has specifically requested you lose 
weight at a quicker rate, I strongly encourage you to consult with a registered 
dietitian who can monitor you closely.
1,000-calorie deficit with a low-glycemic diet
Pros:
	
✓	You’ll see quicker results (an average of a 2-pound weight loss per week),
which is very desirable.
	
✓	Motivation is strong because you can see quick results.

62
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Cons:
	
✓	You must work harder and make significant changes right away. (To give 
you an example, a 30-minute brisk walk burns around 175 calories. To 
hit a 1,000-calorie deficit just by exercising this way, you’d still have a 
long way to go.)
	
✓	Being on a strict diet regimen requires an increased amount of focus 
that can be tough to maintain for long.
	
✓	Long-term compliance is significantly decreased. Research has proven 
that when people make more than a 400-calorie deficit each day, they’re 
less likely to stick with the changes long term; ultimately they regain 
their weight.
	
✓	Taking the fast approach to weight loss doesn’t give you time to change 
your habits. It takes 30 days (or even up to three months!) to change one 
habit. When you try to jump into new eating and exercise habits all at 
once, you have a higher probability of quitting altogether because the 
changes are too overwhelming.
	
✓	You may become overly focused or obsessed about food, calorie 
counting, and the numbers on the scale.
100- to 400-calorie deficit with a low-glycemic diet
Pros:
	
✓	Taking the slow-but-steady approach to weight loss gives you time and 
space to change your habits and get used to a low-glycemic diet, which 
leads to better long-term compliance.
	
✓	You’ll be more likely to stick with the changes and therefore see signifi­
cantly better long-term results.
	
✓	Focus is still necessary, but you can focus on a few things at a time instead 
of trying to adapt to 10 to 15 different lifestyle changes at once. This 
narrower focus allows you to tackle bigger obstacles that continue to 
get in the way of weight loss, such as life-long conditioning, food 
cravings, and emotional or stress-based eating.
	
✓	You’re less obsessive about food and calorie counting than someone 
trying to lose weight quickly. In other words, you don’t let weight loss 
consume your whole life.
Cons:
	
✓	Results happen over months, not weeks. (Note: This varies; some people 
may lose 1⁄2 to 1 pound per week. In general, though, the overall process 
is slower.)
	
✓	Failing to see immediate results when you’re making positive changes 
can be frustrating, requiring you to find other ways to self-motivate than 
looking at the scale.

 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
Taking a Close Look at 
Your Dieting History
Reviewing your dieting history can give you a glimpse into whether a low-
glycemic diet will work for you long term. It can also give you some strategies for 
approaching a low-glycemic diet differently than past diets you may have tried.
	
Looking back at past dieting attempts to see what worked and what didn’t is 
always a good idea. By truly evaluating your past dieting history you can pre­
pare yourself to try a new approach instead of sticking to the same old style 
that never worked for you in the first place.
In the next sections, I explore a few factors to think about regarding your 
past dieting experience. When you know the dieting style that works for you 
and you’re able to recognize bad dieting behaviors such as restrictive dieting 
and yo-yo dieting, you’ll have a better shot at making your low-glycemic diet 
a true lifestyle change.
Evaluating types of diets you’ve tried
As you determine how best to adopt a low-glycemic lifestyle, take some time 
to evaluate the types of diets you’ve tried in the past. Were they strict? Did 
they call for you to eliminate certain foods or follow menus? Did you have to 
buy specific food? Not all diets work the same for all people, which is why the 
goal of this exercise is to help you find your personal dieting style. (Note: At 
times you may need to use a mix of styles to get yourself on track. That’s fine 
so long as you find those styles that work for you long term.)
So many people try to fit into a dieting style that just doesn’t work for them, 
making it difficult for them to stick with it for the long haul. For example, if 
you aren’t much into counting calories, like me, depending on calorie count­
ing as the main focus of your diet is difficult. Allow yourself to let go of this 
model and instead focus on your choices so you don’t get stuck in a behavior 
that isn’t getting you results.
	
Anyone can lose weight, but only a small percentage of people can keep it off. 
Part of that process is discovering what type of dieting really works for you.
	
One of the reasons I love the low-glycemic diet is that you can really make it fit 
your dieting personality, thereby molding it into the perfect diet for you. For 
example,
	
✓	If you’re a numbers person and really like counting and tracking calories,
you may enjoy taking the approach of counting your glycemic load for 
the day.

64
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
✓	If you like structure, planning, and lists, then making a low-glycemic 
meal plan and shopping list each week will work well for you.
	
✓	If you like simple rules, you may benefit from setting up how many low-
glycemic foods you want to use in a meal or making sure you have a fruit 
or vegetable each meal.
	
✓	If you respond better when you pay attention to your body’s cues, then 
you’ll be pleased to know that the moderate approach of a low-glycemic 
diet allows you the flexibility to make educated choices based on your 
needs at that time. (So if you’re at a party and craving potato chips, you 
can feel comfortable balancing a small portion of that high-glycemic 
craving with lower-glycemic foods.)
Rethinking restrictive dieting
Restricting your food choices too much almost always backfires. If you’ve been 
on enough diets in the past, you’ve probably experienced this firsthand. I know 
I’ve seen it in clients I’ve worked with. I always find that people feel they need 
to follow a very strict diet to stay on track, assuming they’ll blow it if they’re 
given any leeway. Yet when I ask them whether they were able to follow the 
strict diet long term, the answer is always no. So clearly the strict approach 
doesn’t work. But don’t just take my word for it; there’s a significant body of 
research around to back up this observation. This research shows that when 
you restrict yourself from certain foods, that action causes you to be more 
focused on the food and end up overeating when you do have it.
Makes sense, doesn’t it? Imagine for a minute if I tell you that you can’t eat a 
cookie. You then see a homemade chocolate chip cookie that looks delicious, 
yet you tell yourself, “No, I can’t have it.” Then you start thinking more and 
more about how good that cookie must taste. When you finally break down 
and eat it, you explode and say, “Well, I already ate one. I’ll eat more and go 
back on my diet tomorrow.” Such a scenario is common for many people.
Don’t forget to pay attention to your dieting history too. If you’ve never been 
able to follow restrictive food rules long term, trying to be utterly strict with 
a low-glycemic diet will be a never-ending battle. Try not to look at high-
glycemic foods as all the foods you have to restrict yourself from; if you do, 
you may become overly focused on them! Instead, adopt the mindset that all 
foods are okay as long as you balance them appropriately.
	
A low-glycemic diet can work very well as long as you don’t approach it as 
restricting certain foods altogether, especially if this approach has backfired 
on you before.
	
If you feel you’re having difficulties abandoning a restrictive mindset, reach 
out and get some help from a counselor trained to handle eating issues.

 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
Your thinking style can affect your 
weight-loss results
Inga Treitler, a cultural anthropologist and 
researcher at The National Weight Control 
Registry, followed ten individuals who lost 30 
or more pounds and kept it off for a year or 
more. She had them take the Herrmann Brain 
Dominance Instrument (HBDI) questionnaire 
that assesses thinking styles and helps people 
define how to solve problems. What Treitler 
found is that people typically fall into one of 
four quadrants:
	✓	“A” quadrant: People in this group are num­
bers people. They’re drawn to mathemati­
cal and analytical solutions, and they often 
overanalyze situations so much that they 
have difficulty taking action. A-quadrant 
folks do better with a combination of 
number tracking (such as calories and/or 
the number of steps they take each day) 
and regular coaching or nutrition counsel­
ing to help them take action.
	✓	“B” quadrant: These individuals love struc­
ture and routines. They always have a plan 
and are the type to keep a planner with all 
of their appointments scheduled. Guess 
what? This group is the most successful 
with a traditional diet approach of following 
menu plans and tracking progress, which 
makes sense because B-quadrant folks are 
comfortable following plans. B-quadrant 
individuals do well with menu-planning ser­
vices, tracking calories, counting glycemic 
load, and setting goals because they feel 
comfortable with a specific, structured plan.
	✓	“C” quadrant: These folks are spiritual and 
emotional and are very connected to the 
human experience. This group benefits 
from a nondiet approach to weight loss 
rather than a strict diet regimen. Why? 
Because these folks are more comfortable 
learning about their internal relationship 
with food, being mindful, and getting to 
know their food triggers. They benefit from 
personal guidance from a coach or nutri­
tionist who practices a nondiet approach.
	✓	“D” quadrant: This group is very visual, 
enjoys taking risks and trying new things, 
and gets bored easily. D-quadrant individu­
als benefit from a nondiet approach that 
uses visual examples of meal preparation 
as opposed to a rigid dietary plan because 
they’d get tired of following a meal plan or 
eating in a strict way.
Another interesting thing that Treitler found in 
her observations is that all successful long-
term losers had found a coach, mentor, or guide 
while they were losing their weight. During this 
time, they all underwent some sort of major life 
transformation. They stepped away from their 
old lifestyle and into a new one, letting go of all 
of their old hang-ups around food. They also 
incorporated some sort of meditative practice 
into their lives, such as walking or yoga. This 
self time seems to be an important link to help 
people let go of some of the behaviors that 
aren’t serving them anymore.
Putting a stop to yo-yo dieting
Yo-yo dieting — when you try a diet, lose weight, go back to your old habits, 
and gain the weight back — is what I consider the plague of weight loss. It’s a 
vicious cycle that’s all too easy to fall into every time a new diet comes out.

66
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
Yo-yo dieting can affect your metabolism in a negative way, making it much 
easier to gain weight later on. Plus you have the added frustration of always 
struggling with weight loss. Add to all that the fact that, according to research, 
yo-yo dieting may even affect your immune system in a negative way, and you 
realize how important it is to avoid this behavior.
If you’re a person who frequently gets stuck in the cycle of yo-yo dieting, I 
suggest you do your best to let go of the diet mentality and look at the low-
glycemic diet as a new lifestyle that requires you to be committed to a new 
way of living.
	
If you’re looking at a low-glycemic diet as a temporary way to get your weight 
down, you’ll likely end up in this yo-yo trap yet again. The trick to ending 
yo-yo dieting is to embrace a new, realistic diet regimen and be willing to let 
go of your old behaviors. Like any new thought process, reorienting how you 
think about food and eating will take some time, but that’s perfectly fine (and 
normal!).
Asking yourself the right questions
	
People often dive right into new diet regimens only to find that those regimens 
don’t work for them or that now just isn’t the right time in their lives to make 
changes. If you’re still trying to decide whether a low-glycemic diet is appropri­
ate for you, take a few minutes to ask yourself the following questions:
	
✓	Can I see myself following a low-glycemic diet for a lifetime?
	
✓	Am I ready to make lifestyle changes?
	
✓	Am I willing to look at this as a process rather than a quick fix?
	
✓	Do I enjoy low-glycemic foods?
	
✓	Do I enjoy trying new foods and recipes?
	
✓	Will I have good support from my family?
	
✓	Do the low-glycemic guidelines seem like something that will work in my 
current lifestyle? If not, am I willing to make some changes to my life­
style (such as cooking at home more and/or buying new foods)?
	
✓	What do I really want — to lose weight fast or to lose a little weight more 
slowly so I can give myself the time and space to adopt new habits?
If losing weight was just a matter of following a plan and exercising, then it’d 
be easy. However, losing weight successfully and for the long haul requires 
changing your habits and, in some cases, a lifetime of conditioning. That 
makes the road a bit harder, but it’s not impossible to travel if you take the 
time to point yourself on the right path. Evaluating your dieting history and 
addressing the preceding questions fully will set you up for long-term weight-
loss success on a low-glycemic diet.

 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
Do You Have Insulin Resistance?
Insulin resistance is a condition in which your muscle, fat, and liver cells don’t 
respond properly to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that trans­
ports blood glucose (blood sugar) from the food you eat into your cells. As a 
result, your body needs more insulin to help blood glucose enter your cells. 
The pancreas tries to keep up with this increased demand for insulin by pro­
ducing more. Eventually, the pancreas fails to keep up with the body’s need 
for insulin, and excess blood glucose builds up.
Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both blood glucose 
and insulin circulating in their blood at the same time. Among other health 
complications, this excess blood glucose and insulin can cause your body 
to store more calories as fat and can increase food cravings and feelings of 
hunger. People who are overweight and inactive have a higher risk of devel­
oping some sort of insulin resistance. The thing is, you can have insulin resis­
tance without even realizing it. The only way to know for sure is to undergo a 
blood test.
Perhaps you’ve been tested for and diagnosed with insulin resistance. If so, 
then good for you because you can take measures to deal with it. One such 
measure is to follow a low-glycemic lifestyle. A low-glycemic approach to 
eating is helpful in improving insulin function and preventing insulin resis­
tance from turning into an even bigger health concern. When you consume 
enough low-glycemic foods on a regular basis, you cut down the amount of 
excess blood glucose floating around in your blood, allowing your pancreas 
to produce less insulin, so you wind up using blood glucose as energy instead 
of storing it as fat.
The following sections give you the scoop on health conditions and symp­
toms associated with insulin resistance, as well as advice on how to begin 
managing this condition by following a low-glycemic lifestyle.
Health conditions related to 
insulin resistance
In some cases, insulin resistance is a byproduct of obesity, but it can also be 
a byproduct of numerous health issues. Following are several known health 
issues associated with insulin resistance (you can find more information on 
most of these health conditions in Chapter 22):
	
✓	Prediabetes
	
✓	Type 2 diabetes
	
✓	Gestational diabetes

68
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
	
✓	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
	
✓	Metabolic syndrome (otherwise known as insulin resistance syndrome 
or Syndrome X)
Many people feel all they can do is take their medication and live with these 
health problems, but the reality is that none of these diagnoses needs to be 
a death sentence. There’s great potential to improve and/or reverse each of 
these conditions with diet and exercise. Following a low-glycemic diet can 
even help alleviate some of the symptoms of these conditions (such as mood­
iness, hunger, and fatigue) by giving you better control of your blood sugar.
	
If you have one of these conditions (or if you’re currently overweight and have 
a family member with one of these conditions, putting you at greater risk for 
developing the same condition), then you can benefit greatly from eating a low-
glycemic diet, which helps you manage your blood sugar while losing weight.
	
Simply losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight may be enough to reverse or 
prevent these health conditions from occurring. A low-glycemic diet can help 
you lose that weight by regulating your blood sugar and insulin levels.
Characteristics of insulin resistance
Wondering whether insulin resistance is behind your inability to lose weight? 
The only way to know for sure is to get tested. However, you can check your 
body and medical history for the common characteristics of insulin resis­
tance, which include the following:
	
✓	Dark patches of skin on the back of your neck, elbows, knees, knuckles, 
or armpits
	
✓	Skin tags, small raised areas that appear on the skin that may be the 
color of your skin or darker, like a mole
	
✓	Being overweight
	
✓	A family history of diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome
	
✓	Difficulty losing weight on a low-calorie diet with regular exercise
	
✓	High cholesterol or high triglycerides
	
✓	Fertility problems
If you have any of these symptoms, your first plan of action is to go to a 
doctor to get tested. Adopting a low-glycemic diet is the next step to help get 
your blood sugar under control.
If you have some symptoms of insulin resistance but come up negative for it 
when tested, you may still benefit from following a low-glycemic diet. Perhaps 

69
 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
you simply experience food cravings and hunger. Getting your blood sugar 
under control and eating the right balance of foods at the appropriate times 
can help you control those cravings. There’s also good support that a low-
glycemic diet helps with hunger throughout the day (see Chapter 3 to find 
out what I mean). That’s all good news for you, my friend!
How a low-glycemic lifestyle can help
If you have insulin resistance, don’t fret. Help is here! Simply start choosing 
low-glycemic foods. They have a smaller impact on your blood sugar levels, 
which means your body has to produce less insulin to process them. Aside 
from lower blood sugar levels and decreased insulin requirements, opting 
for low-glycemic foods can help you feel fuller after eating, reduce your food 
cravings, and lose weight. Put all that together, and it adds up to improved 
overall health.
	
Here are a few basic pointers for using a low-glycemic diet to counteract 
insulin resistance:
	
✓	Select only low-glycemic foods. These foods require much less insulin 
to process the sugar in the blood, allowing your pancreas (the organ 
that makes insulin) to catch its breath, so to speak.
	
✓	Watch portion sizes. Just because a food is low-glycemic doesn’t mean 
you can eat it in large amounts. Doing that can lead to a high glyce­
mic load, meaning that large amounts of insulin would be required to 
combat the rising blood sugars (not to mention the additional calories).
	
✓	Balance your meals. Lean protein sources and healthy fats help round 
out a meal and can slow your body’s rate of digestion and absorption of 
food. (Chapter 9 has specific tips on creating balance.)
	
Many people battling insulin resistance are also dealing with other health con­
ditions. It may be wise to seek out a local health professional for more 
personal advice based on your specific health profile.
Considering a Low-Glycemic Diet if You 
Have Kids or Are Pregnant
You may want to begin a low-glycemic lifestyle, but is that lifestyle appropriate 
for other members of your family? The answer is a resounding yes. A low-
glycemic lifestyle benefits everyone, including children and pregnant women, 
as you discover in the following sections.

Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
Helping kids have a healthy 
relationship with food
Childhood obesity is on the rise, and with that comes a risk of diabetes and 
heart disease at an incredibly young age. Children are more sedentary these 
days, and food choices and portion sizes have changed to big and bigger 
over the years, ultimately leading to weight gain. Diet programs for children 
are tricky, though, because you don’t want them to be part of the statistics of 
those who lose and gain over and over again. You also have to consider kids’ 
ages and their ability to deal with self-esteem issues regarding body image.
	
A low-glycemic diet can be a good solution for parents looking to help their 
children with weight loss. Here’s why:
	
✓	It promotes a healthy long-term relationship with food.
	
✓	It doesn’t restrict kids’ calorie levels too much or limit their carbohydrate 
levels while they’re growing and active.
	
✓	Low-glycemic foods can be used in moderation so children can feel like 
they’re living a normal life and not like they’re being put on a “diet.”
	
✓	There’s no need for kids to eat “diet” foods that may make them feel 
uncomfortable around others their age.
	
✓	It can lower children’s risk for diabetes and heart disease.
	
✓	It can easily be incorporated into kids’ lifestyles without drastic changes.
Research is showing some positive outcomes for adolescents using a low-
glycemic diet for weight loss. One study showed that adolescents who fol­
lowed a low-glycemic diet for a year lost 11 pounds more than those on a 
traditional lowfat diet. In this study, the adolescents also preferred the low-
glycemic diet over a traditional diet because they didn’t have to count calo­
ries or be overly focused on food — both of which are keys to developing a 
child’s healthy relationship with food as he grows older.
The results for children are mixed. However, even with the inconsistencies, 
positive outcomes still exist. One small study showed that children who used 
a low-glycemic diet didn’t change their body weight but did lower their per­
centage of body fat, their waist-to-hip ratio, and their hunger level. The inter­
esting factor in this study is that the children replaced at least 50 percent of 
their carbohydrate choices with low-glycemic carbohydrates, showing again 
that moderation works well with this particular diet approach — another 
great plus for kids.

71
 Chapter 5: Determining How Going Low-Glycemic Can Work for You
	
Using a low-glycemic diet alone or combining it with a moderate decrease in 
calories can be a winning combination for children who need to lose weight. 
Following are some good tips for starting your child on a low-glycemic diet:
	
✓	Be moderate with your approach. Putting a child on a strict diet will 
make him miserable and can cause him to fixate on food in an unhealthy 
way. You get better results with moderation, and you set your child up 
to have a healthy relationship with food.
	
✓	Make it a family plan. Incorporate the low-glycemic diet for everyone so 
your child doesn’t feel singled out. Making a child eat pearl barley while 
everyone else gets pasta is hard on him emotionally and can impact his 
self-esteem.
	
✓	Encourage fun activities. Strict exercise regimens can make your child 
end up hating exercise later on in life. Instead of going the strict route, 
encourage fun activities such as bike riding, swimming, or just getting 
some old-fashioned play time outside.
	
✓	Avoid dieting language. You can influence your child’s weight without 
putting too much attention on the scale. This approach helps kids 
naturally develop new habits instead of feeling bad about their bodies 
or that something’s wrong with them.
Managing weight and blood 
sugar while pregnant
Ah pregnancy, a time to eat whatever you want, right? Well, not exactly.
	
Gaining too much weight during pregnancy leaves you at risk of high blood 
pressure, gestational diabetes, and varicose veins. It also poses a problem to 
your baby if it ends up being too big. Of course, you don’t want to lose weight 
during pregnancy either, even if you’re overweight. The goal is to manage 
your weight gain by gaining the appropriate amount.
	
Following are some good ranges to keep in mind for healthy weight gain 
during pregnancy:
	
✓	28–40 pounds if you were underweight before pregnancy
	
✓	25–37 pounds if you were a healthy weight before pregnancy
	
✓	15–25 pounds if you were overweight before pregnancy

72
Part I: Exploring the Glycemic Index as a Weight-Loss Tool
A low-glycemic diet is such a great choice for pregnant women because you 
don’t have to restrict calories, you get better control of your blood sugar, 
and you take in lots of high-nutrient foods that are important for your baby. 
It also allows you to not be too restrictive during your pregnancy, which no 
pregnant woman ever wants to have to do.
One issue that many women face during pregnancy is gestational diabetes. This 
is a type of diabetes that appears during pregnancy and most often goes 
away after the pregnancy is over. A small study published in 2009 showed 
that women with gestational diabetes who followed a low-glycemic diet 
reduced their need for insulin compared to those who ate a high-glycemic 
diet. More research is needed in this area, but one fact is clear: Controlling 
blood sugar is always the first step of a diabetic diet.
	
If you have gestational diabetes, make sure to let your doctor know about any 
diet changes because they can affect any medications you may be taking for 
blood sugar control and should be monitored. Also, note that with gestational 
diabetes, just like any other type of diabetes, you may need to follow a bit 
stricter protocol with a low-glycemic diet. Don’t hesitate to get help from a 
registered dietitian or a certified diabetes educator when you need it.

C
hanging your eating habits isn’t easy because there’s 
so much involved with your daily food choices. Just 
think about it. You enjoy the taste of some foods and dis­
like the taste of others. Perhaps you grew up eating spe­
cific foods or you’ve never tried healthy foods such as 
quinoa, tofu, or asparagus. Aside from personal prefer­
ence and eating habits, food plays a variety of roles in 
modern culture. It’s used for celebration, consolation, and 
welcoming friends and family. With all of those factors in 
play, changing your eating habits can seem daunting, but 
it doesn’t have to be that way.
The chapters in this part help you formulate specific 
behavior-change goals to help you meet your individual 
weight-loss goals and understand the process of success­
fully developing new habits. They also explain behaviors 
and strategies designed to increase your metabolic rate. 
Finally, to help you implement a lower-glycemic style of 
eating, this part provides you with healthy-eating strate­
gies as well as smart grocery-shopping strategies so you 
can stand a better chance of purchasing healthy, low-
calorie, low-glycemic foods your entire family will enjoy.

▶	Recognizing the power of positive, reason-driven thinking
▶	Discovering how to set realistic and practical goals
▶	Keeping a food journal to better understand your eating habits
▶	Knowing what you’re in for with a low-glycemic weight-loss plan
S
o, you’re ready to get started with your new low-glycemic plan for 
weight loss. Congratulations! Before you jump in, though, you need to 
take some time to prepare yourself mentally, set some realistic goals, and 
make sure you know what you’re in for. That’s precisely what this chapter 
helps you do.
	
You may be tempted to skip this chapter. After all, you’re excited and want 
to get started on this diet right away, right? Please resist that temptation! The 
strategies in this chapter can significantly increase your weight-loss success 
and keep you motivated for the long haul. Without them, you may find your­
self floundering down the road.
Getting and Staying in the Right Mindset
People who lose weight and keep it off have one important thing in common: 
They have a positive mindset. They love the way they feel, enjoy food more, 
possess new stress-management tools, and have activities that make them 
feel great.

76
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Although you may be starting this new journey excited and motivated, if 
you’re honest with yourself, you’ll probably realize that you’re still thinking 
some negative thoughts like
	
✓	I’m going to have to give up foods I love.
	
✓	I’ll try it, but I don’t know if it’ll work.
	
✓	I’m going to have to exercise — and I hate exercising.
	
If you don’t get these negative thoughts in check, self-sabotage can rear its 
ugly head. It turns obstacles and challenges into reasons to give up. These 
saboteurs show up as
	
✓	Decreased focus on absorbing new information
	
✓	Feeling defeated with normal challenges
	
✓	Letting other areas of your life always take priority
	
✓	Having no time for finding out about and trying new changes
Okay, so you get that you need a positive mindset to stay on track, but how 
exactly do you do that? Follow these three simple steps:
	
1.	Create a vision.
	
2.	Turn that vision into an affirmation.
	
3.	Focus on using positive language in all situations.
The following sections cover each of these steps in more detail to help you 
put them together to create your own positive mindset about your new low-
glycemic lifestyle.
Creating your vision
The first step to creating a positive mindset is to come up with your long-
term goal, which I like to call your vision. Your vision is how you see the 
big picture, your plan that always serves to motivate you. Visions motivate 
because they’re your ultimate desires of how you want to see your life play 
out. After all, you have to know where you’re going before you can take the 
first steps to get there.
To create your vision, first think of some internal reasons why you want to 
lose weight and why you want to follow a low-glycemic diet in particular. 

77
 Chapter 6: Preparing Yourself for a Successful Weight-Loss Program
Internal reasons are things that are life changing, such as improved health or 
becoming more active with your family and friends. Your internal goal calls 
on you to live your best life.
	
Even though weight loss is the top priority in your mind, when your goals are 
simply to lose weight or fit into a certain size, they aren’t meaningful enough 
to help you through challenges. How the weight loss changes your life, not 
your waistline, is what’s meaningful.
So instead of thinking about your ideal body weight, think about what you 
want your ideal body to be. Other than sizes and numbers on the scale, 
what types of changes do you want to see by following a low-glycemic diet? 
Perhaps you’ll increase your energy throughout the day, or maybe your new 
diet will help you feel strong and vital and keep you healthy and vibrant. 
Many people choose a low-glycemic diet because of specific health issues, 
so perhaps you expect a low-glycemic diet to help you get your blood sugar 
under control, decrease inflammation, or even aid with fertility (depending 
on your personal circumstances).
Take some time to create your vision. The more excited you are about your 
inner picture, the more of an active role you’ll take toward your weight-loss 
goals. Here’s a sample that illustrates how you can weave your internal rea­
sons into your vision:
My vision is to lose enough weight so I can lower my blood pressure and be 
able to have the endurance and energy to join my family members on their 
annual backpacking trip so I can experience new adventures in my life. I 
want to feel comfortable, fit, and energetic.
	
To overcome the day-to-day obstacles, your vision must be greater than 
your challenges. These obstacles mask themselves as “no time,” “the kids,” 
“my job,” and the like. They’re all the “yeah, buts . . .” that come up for every 
single person. That doesn’t mean these obstacles aren’t real. On the contrary, 
they’re very real. But when you have an inspiring vision, it’s powerful enough 
to motivate you to get around these obstacles. People who’ve lost weight and 
kept it off have at least one strong internal reason for losing weight — and that 
reason drives their vision.
Turning your vision into an affirmation
Changing your vision into a positive affirmation adds even more power 
to your mindset. A positive affirmation is a statement that highlights your 
strengths, talents, and skills.

78
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
When creating your affirmation, make sure it’s in the present tense. There are 
two reasons for this:
	
✓	Your natural thoughts, positive or negative, occur in the present tense. 
For example, “I struggle with exercise,” “I love eating salads,” “I enjoy 
cooking new foods.”
	
✓	By taking the first steps, you’re presently making changes, not making 
them way off in the future. You’re actively changing your life right now.
Focusing on the present helps make your affirmation more powerful. Take a 
look at this example to see what I mean:
I’m able to change my old habits. I’m willing and able to focus my diet on 
low-glycemic foods and create change that helps me lose weight, lower my 
blood pressure, and build my endurance and energy. I’m motivated to join 
my family’s annual backpacking trip feeling comfortable, fit, and energetic.
Powerful visions can keep you motivated
Ann is a client of mine who has a fairly hectic 
life: full-time working mother of two children 
and primary bread winner in her family (on a 
100-percent-commisision job, no less). Health-
wise, she has high cholesterol, Polycystic Ovary 
Syndrome, and is always struggling to lose 20 
pounds. Life simply gets in the way, causing her 
food choices to become less conscious and her 
exercise to decline.
Ann always wanted to lose weight, but she 
consistently focused on the number on the 
scale or the size of her clothes rather than an 
internal reason. Consequently, she’d do great 
for a few weeks and then slide back into her 
old habits when challenges arose. That was 
the pattern until Ann set a vision to do a major 
hike/climb with her husband, who often took 
these trips with his male friends. Ann felt like 
she missed out on seeing some amazing things 
simply because the climb seemed too physically 
challenging for her.
Instead of focusing on losing weight, Ann began 
to focus on training for her trip, which made for 
a big shift in her motivation. Ann became very 
lean and muscular and lowered her cholesterol 
to normal limits. Her vision also helped her find 
ways around her various obstacles. Instead of 
running through a fast-food restaurant while 
taking the kids to their various sports, she found 
quick meals they could eat before getting in the 
car. Instead of skipping breakfast in the morn­
ing, she brought all the fixings to work so she 
could make it there. She even began to wake 
up at 5:30 a.m. to get in her exercise because 
there was no other time of day that she could do 
it. The moral of Ann’s story? When you have a 
powerful vision, it helps you stay motivated and 
enables you to find solutions for the obstacles 
that come up in daily life.

79
 Chapter 6: Preparing Yourself for a Successful Weight-Loss Program
	
Write down your vision using affirmative statements and keep that inner pic­
ture of what you’re working toward around you at all times. Make several 
copies and keep one near your computer, your calendar, your refrigerator, 
and/or in your wallet. You may also benefit by reading your affirmation each 
night before bed or first thing in the morning.
Using positive language
No matter how positive your mindset about following the glycemic index 
diet, it’s still possible for negative thoughts to creep in because you’re going 
to experience some challenges along the way. Having some doubt and hesi­
tation is natural, but don’t let that sway you from your internal reasons for 
wanting to lose weight. Pay attention to your language and try to keep it as 
positive as possible.
	
Changing a negative statement into a positive one helps you come up with 
solutions instead of staying stuck. For instance, perhaps you’re having difficul­
ties giving up rice at meals, but you also enjoy some of the new recipes you’ve 
tried. Your language may become negative along the lines of “I don’t have 
time to cook these recipes” or “I don’t like thinking of things to cook with my 
chicken entrees.” Instead of taking a Negative Nelly approach, use positive lan­
guage, such as “I really enjoy some of the new recipes I’ve tried.” Then focus 
your energy on how to make those new changes work with your busy sched­
ule and find some grains that will fit in with chicken as easily as rice does.
Positive statements also help you move forward. Instead of stating, “I don’t 
love vegetables,” you can say, “I know there are five low-glycemic vegetables 
I really enjoy.” When you put it that way, your mind automatically begins 
thinking of ways to incorporate those vegetables you like.
Setting Goals You Can Actually Achieve
You may be fed up with circumstances in your life and want to approach 
weight loss with gusto, changing everything about your day-to-day at once. 
Don’t. Instead, focus on setting small weekly goals. These goals — which 
should be realistic, practical, and attainable — become the building blocks of 
your weight-loss program. You achieve greater success by creating goals you 
can keep, which is why I show you how to develop achievable goals in the fol­
lowing sections.

80
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Being realistic
Set yourself up for success by making sure your goals are realistic. Start 
small so you can achieve your goals and then build on them. You don’t want 
to set a goal of making a new low-glycemic recipe five nights a week if you 
currently don’t cook at all. This goal may be unattainable and may make you 
feel like a failure if you don’t reach it. Instead, set a goal to try one new recipe 
a week and find low-glycemic convenience foods to create some other meals.
	
Yes, fast results are far more appealing, but research shows that making 
changes too quickly almost always ends up with the dieter regaining the 
weight later. It’s better to make small changes that you can truly live with long 
term, master them, and then set new goals. Setting small, realistic goals is the 
difference between losing 24 pounds in three months only to regain it all and 
losing 24 pounds in six months to a year and keeping it off for a lifetime.
	
With a realistic and safe approach to weight loss, you can expect to see little or no 
weight loss the first three weeks while you’re getting used to adding low-glycemic 
foods to your diet. After that, you should aim for 1- to 2-pound weight loss per 
week. This pace indicates you’re losing fat, not muscle or mere water weight.
Making your goals practical
Your goals must fit into your lifestyle; otherwise you won’t be able to accom­
plish them. For instance, if your day is scheduled around traveling from place 
to place, setting a goal of eating lunch at home likely isn’t practical. Why not 
make a goal to bring your lunch or have a low-glycemic deli sandwich and 
salad instead? If you travel for work, setting a goal to go to the gym may not 
work regularly, so you may want to plan on walking or finding a workout you 
can do in your hotel room.
	
The only way to make changes work long term is to be sure they make sense 
in your particular lifestyle.
Choosing “want to” rather than 
“have to” goals
	
If you choose a goal because you “want to,” not because you “have to,” you’re 
more likely to be successful. For instance, if you enjoy eating ice cream at 
night and you decide to eliminate it because you “have to,” you probably 
won’t stay on course for long. The “have to’s” bring up negative emotions and 

81
 Chapter 6: Preparing Yourself for a Successful Weight-Loss Program
lead to guilt when you do indulge. They also lead to resistance. People resist 
what they “have to” do and look forward to what they “want to” do. That’s just 
human nature.
So instead of saying, “I have to give up my nightly dish of ice cream to lose 
weight,” think of a way to convert that statement into a “want to” statement, 
such as, “I want to decrease my ice cream intake to half of what I typically eat 
as one way to reduce my glycemic load for the day.”
Strengthening your goals
	
Have you ever set a goal that you quickly forgot about a week later? When a 
goal is weak and not grounded with your internal vision, you’re more likely 
to push it aside and not work toward it. Use these simple steps to help 
strengthen your goals so you can get the results you’re looking for:
	
✓	Write or type out your goals in detail. Getting your goals on paper is 
one of the best ways to give them clarity and specificity. Having your 
goals in writing helps lock them into your memory and increases your 
focus.
	
✓	Place your goals where you can review them daily. The particular spot 
doesn’t really matter so long as you’re guaranteed to see the goals each 
day. Seeing your goals each day helps keep you motivated so that you 
stay in forward motion even when life gets hectic.
	
✓	Tell some supportive friends and family about your goals. Make sure 
these individuals want to help you succeed and provide a good support 
system for you.
Focusing Your Choices 
with a Food Journal
Some people find they need help holding themselves accountable to their 
goals. If you’re among them, I suggest you start a food journal — a daily record 
of everything you eat and drink, how active you are, how you’re feeling about 
your food intake, and any emotions or challenges you experience regarding 
eating.

82
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
A food journal can be extremely helpful in making long-term changes to 
your eating habits. Case in point: A study published in 2008 in the American 
Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that those who kept a record of their 
food and beverage intake had roughly double the weight loss of those who 
hadn’t kept any records.
Often people think they’re making healthy choices, but their lives get so busy 
that they don’t realize when they’re engaging in mindless eating. Using a food 
journal decreases unconscious eating, which is often the culprit in eating the 
wrong foods too often or too much food altogether. A food journal can also 
serve as a source of encouragement as you follow your progress and track 
your activity. Keeping one as you begin a low-glycemic lifestyle can show 
you what’s working well, what parts of the diet are more challenging for you, 
and whether you tend to lean toward your old comfort foods when you’re 
stressed or busy.
	
You can start using a food journal immediately by buying a small notebook, 
jotting notes in your planner or smartphone, or creating a chart on your 
computer. The form your food journal takes (handwritten or electronic) 
all depends on your own personal style and what works best for you. For 
instance, I keep a daily Post-It on my computer screen to remind me to keep 
track of my food intake.
Following are some sample topics to record in your food journal:
	
✓	Date
	
✓	Time
	
✓	Food item consumed
	
✓	Amount consumed (cups, tablespoons, and so on)
	
✓	Emotions/challenges/sugar cravings
	
✓	Physical activity (cardio, strength training, and stretching)
Note: You may find that these topics morph as you discover what works for 
you and what you find beneficial to note as you become more used to a low-
glycemic lifestyle. For example, if you’re a detail-oriented person, you may 
also enjoy counting calories or grams of fiber. If you’re more emotionally 
driven, you may find a few lines at the bottom of the page for daily reflection/
analysis. Figure 6-1 shows a sample template for a food journal. Use it as a 
reference, but take the time to experiment and figure out what format works 
best for you.

What to Expect When Starting 
Your Journey
Knowing what you’re in for can you help you avoid some common weight-
loss pitfalls and empower you to keep moving forward. Because I want you to 
succeed in and enjoy your new low-glycemic lifestyle, I use the following sec­
tions to share what you can expect as you embark on your journey.

84
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
A shift in priorities
Prioritizing may seem like a no-brainer, but it can be one of the biggest 
saboteurs you encounter when starting a low-glycemic diet. Making any new 
change requires a little focus in the beginning before it eventually becomes 
autopilot. However, life always manages to get busy, and focus often 
becomes the first casualty. After all, many people have a natural order of 
things in their lives — children, work, school, social life, the list goes on and 
on. If you ever stop to look at your life, you may find that diet and exercise 
often take a back seat to all the rest.
	
You don’t have to make diet and exercise your top priority, but you should 
move them up to a more prominent position in your life. Following are some 
ideas to help you prioritize your time to accommodate your new low-glycemic 
lifestyle:
	
✓	Make a weekly grocery list using your newfound low-glycemic foods. 
Save a general list so you can reuse it during busy weeks and not feel 
like you have to turn to your old standbys. Also check out Chapter 10, 
which has tips for safely navigating the grocery store on a low-glycemic 
diet.
	
✓	Plan your meals. Meal planning can help make your week go by much 
easier, even if you have a lot going on. You don’t need to plan elaborate 
breakfasts and lunches. Just keep some basic low-glycemic standbys on 
hand and double your dinner recipes so you have a few nights of leftovers.
	
✓	Keep low-glycemic convenience foods stocked. Doing so allows you 
to make meals in a pinch if necessary. You can find out more about this 
strategy in Chapter 10.
	
✓	Treat your exercise time as important as your haircut appointment. A 
haircut appointment is pretty tough to miss, but exercise is easy to put 
off until another day. Set your exercise date and time and treat it like an 
appointment that can only be missed for emergencies. (The premiere of 
the latest hit TV show doesn’t count. You can always do a little exercise 
while watching it.)
	
Shopping and cooking with low-glycemic foods may take more focus on choices, 
but it doesn’t necessarily take more time. For example, making grilled chicken 
with spaghetti (a low-glycemic grain) as opposed to grilled chicken over rice 
(a high-glycemic grain) doesn’t take more time to shop for or cook up. You 
just have to make a priority of doing it.
An adventure with new foods
Believe it or not, eating a low-glycemic diet opens you up to a whole new 
world of food opportunities. You don’t have to learn how to be a top chef, 

85
 Chapter 6: Preparing Yourself for a Successful Weight-Loss Program
nor do you have to make complicated meals. But you do need to be prepared 
to explore some delicious new foods. Why? Because some of your staples 
(some varieties of rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables) may be high-glycemic 
foods.
If you keep an open mind and take some time in the beginning to try new low-
glycemic foods, you may be pleasantly surprised at the types of foods you 
discover. Start slow by selecting one section of the grocery store to explore 
more thoroughly. For example, you can spend some time in the rice and grain 
section. Amidst the hundreds of varieties of rice you’ll find quinoa, a wonder­
ful, chewy, and low-glycemic grain. (Check out Chapter 18 for a great stir-fry 
recipe that calls for quinoa.)
Not only can this food adventure allow you to discover tasty low-glycemic 
foods but it’s also a great way to add more variety to your meals so food 
doesn’t become routine or boring. (When it does, that’s when you’re likely to 
stray from your food goals.)
New habits
Experiencing long-term weight loss on a low-glycemic diet means creating 
some new dietary habits. That’s right, habits. Try not to look at this diet as a 
temporary plan; if you do, be prepared for weight regain down the road. Seek 
out ways to make a low-glycemic diet work in your lifestyle. After the new 
changes become habits, maintaining your weight loss becomes much easier.
	
Changing habits takes three ingredients:
	
✓	Time: The old thought was that it takes 30 days to form a new habit, 
but new research shows it can take up to three months. Keep this fact 
in mind as you begin making changes. It may take some time to feel that 
these new changes have become habits. However, you know your low-
glycemic diet is a habit when your eating choices are on autopilot and 
you don’t need to put as much focus on memorizing lists of low-glycemic 
foods.
	
✓	Consistency: This is the most important part of making new habits. If 
you start creating some changes, go back to your old habits for two 
weeks, and then try some new changes again, it’ll be a l-o-n-g time before 
your new diet feels like a natural part of your life. You won’t be perfect, 
but try not to let setbacks turn into weeks so that you’re practicing your 
goals consistently. (See Chapter 20 for some advice on dealing with set­
backs.)
	
✓	Patience: Beating yourself up when you face setbacks and challenges 
is easy, but please try not to give in to the temptation. After all, you’re 
adopting a new lifestyle that (just like any other new change) takes some 
time to master.

86
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
You don’t have to love every change you try. The trick is to find the changes 
you do like and put your focus there so they become habits. You can find 
many strategies to make a low-glycemic diet work in your unique lifestyle. For 
example, most people feel that finding low-glycemic rice and pastas that work 
in their lifestyle is a bit challenging. On the flip side, they may find it simple to 
add in low-glycemic fruits and vegetables because a wider amount of options 
exist. Focusing on the positive changes helps you feel accomplished, which in 
turn helps you achieve your goals.
Feeling out of your comfort zone at first
Changing habits is critical for long-term weight loss, but it comes with one 
large challenge — stepping out of your comfort zone. Anytime you do some­
thing new that’s different from your prior conditioning, your habitual brain 
tells you to stop and return to your old habits because this change feels dif­
ferent and uncomfortable. You naturally feel tension when changing habits, 
which in return forces you to act. You either slip into default mode and go 
back to your old, comfortable habits, or you stick to your decision and move 
forward to create new habits.
Maybe you’re starting a new job that requires you to be in the office at 8:00 
am. Now you have to get up at 6:00 am when you’re used to getting up at 7:30 
am. Pretty uncomfortable, huh? You’re tired, it’s dark outside, and your body 
clock feels completely off. Can’t you just feel your body pulling you back to 
bed? Well, you have two choices: You can get up, despite how uncomfortable 
you feel, and go into work on time, or you can choose to go back to your old 
habits and stay in bed, accepting the consequences of losing your new job.
Eating a low-glycemic diet works the same way. If you go back to your old 
habits to avoid the temporary discomfort of change, you’ll be accepting the 
undesired consequences (in this case, not losing weight, not feeling better, 
and not developing a healthier lifestyle). Developing a new habit is really only 
uncomfortable for the first couple weeks or so. After that, you’re in a new, 
better-for-you comfort zone.
	
After you start consistently incorporating low-glycemic foods in your diet, you’ll 
feel more comfortable. Just be prepared for a brief period of being out of 
your comfort zone first.

Adding Low-Glycemic Foods 
to Your Meals
In This Chapter

▶	Swapping high-glycemic grains and breads for lower-glycemic varieties
▶	Adding in plenty of fruits, veggies, and beans to provide bulk and help with weight loss
I
ncorporating delicious, low-glycemic foods into your everyday meals and 
snacks is easier than you may expect. You probably already enjoy several 
low-glycemic foods, which gives you a head start on meal planning. Putting 
the glycemic index to work is a matter of knowing whether a food is low-, 
medium-, or high-glycemic. You don’t have to memorize a whole bunch of 
numbers, because several published glycemic index lists are readily avail­
able. You can seek them out or just head to Appendix A for lists of popular 
foods, including foods found in this book’s recipes, to see whether they have 
a low, medium, or high glycemic load (see Chapter 4 for the scoop on glyce­
mic load).
This chapter helps you understand how to choose low-glycemic whole 
grains, pastas, and legumes (also known as beans). It explains which fruits 
and vegetables give you the most volume, help fill you up, and promote a 
healthy weight. It also features tips on simple and easy ways to begin over­
hauling your diet so you can reap the benefits of choosing low-glycemic 
foods.
Using the Glycemic Index
In this section, you discover how to begin using the glycemic index to make 
gradual, lasting changes in your diet. You don’t have to know the actual gly­
cemic number of a food to follow an overall low-glycemic diet. Simply choose 
foods with a low or medium glycemic ranking, and you can be confident that 
you’re making smart choices.

88
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
Several foods have already been tested for their glycemic index, and that infor­
mation is readily available through www.glycemicindex.com, the official 
database compiled by Australian researchers.
Starting with small steps
Making just one or two changes in the foods you choose each day, switching 
from a higher-glycemic food to a lower-glycemic one, for example, can lead to 
big differences over time. The first step is to focus on simple changes that are 
easy to incorporate into your usual eating habits, such as the following:
	
✓	Include one low-glycemic food with every meal and snack. Refer 
to Appendix A for help finding low-glycemic foods, or check out the 
resource mentioned in the preceding section.
	
✓	Eat smaller portions of high-glycemic foods. By cutting your portion 
of a high-glycemic food such as instant mashed potatoes in half, you 
decrease that food’s impact on the overall glycemic load of your meal.
	
✓	Swap out a high-glycemic food for one that’s low- to moderate-glycemic. 
So instead of eating a smaller portion of instant mashed potatoes, you 
could try the made-over potato salad recipe from Chapter 15.
	
Take your time adjusting to these changes in order to give yourself a better 
chance of sticking with them. Set a goal to include a low-glycemic food at just 
one meal the first week. The second week, include a low-glycemic food at a 
second meal. By the time one month has passed, you’ll find incorporating low-
glycemic foods is a habit, not a chore. You’ll also notice improved health and 
mood benefits.
	
As long as you start with small, reasonable changes in the foods you routinely 
eat, you’ll gradually consume more low-glycemic foods and fewer high-glycemic 
foods over time. The end result will be an overall moderate- to low-glycemic 
eating pattern.
Comparing your current food choices 
to see where you can make swaps
When you want to identify where your favorite foods fall on the glycemic 
index list, a good approach is to start looking up the glycemic index of the 
foods each time you eat a meal or a snack. Note how often you choose high-, 

89
 Chapter 7: Adding Low-Glycemic Foods to Your Meals
medium-, and low-glycemic foods. Perhaps lunch most often includes lower-
glycemic foods, but breakfast relies on higher-glycemic breads and cereals. 
Watch for broad patterns such as these in the foods you eat regularly.
	
As you identify your current high-glycemic food choices, think about the low-
glycemic foods you also have on hand. Can you substitute a lower-glycemic 
food for something higher? For example, instant mashed potatoes are high-
glycemic (around 97 on average), but boiled new potatoes with their skins are 
low-glycemic (around 54 on average). Or you can use quick-cooking brown 
rice (with a glycemic index around 48) rather than potatoes in order to keep 
dinner preparation quick and simple.
Think about how you can include medium- or low-glycemic foods for snacks. 
For example, if you love white-flour crackers such as saltines, swap this high-
glycemic snack for a whole-grain cracker such as Triscuits, which have a 
lower glycemic index. Or you can try swapping a lower-glycemic fruit, such as 
melon, for a higher-glycemic one, such as pineapple.
Look through the list of medium- and low-glycemic foods in Appendix A and 
highlight the ones your family routinely enjoys. You may be surprised at the 
number of low-glycemic foods you already include in your daily food choices. 
As you become more familiar with the glycemic index, you’ll be able to 
choose low-glycemic foods without even having to think about it!
	
Following a low-glycemic diet doesn’t mean you have to toss out all the high-
glycemic foods in your cabinets. You can still enjoy them on occasion by 
thinking of ways to balance them with lower-glycemic foods at the same meal. 
For example, if you’re serving a high-glycemic mixed fruit salad for dessert, 
include a low-glycemic starch such as brown rice with the main course. The 
two foods balance each other so that you wind up with a moderate glycemic 
load for the entire meal.
Replacing High-Glycemic Grains 
with Low-Glycemic Ones
Grains are one of those foods people love to hate. Many classic comfort foods 
revolve around grains: fluffy mashed potatoes, creamy white rice, pasta with 
grandma’s secret sauce, and macaroni and cheese. Grains, especially whole 
grains that are less processed, provide a variety of nutrients your body needs 
for good health. Yet many popular grains have a high glycemic index. The 
sections that follow explore several lower-glycemic grains and show you how 
simple — and delicious — it can be to incorporate these grains in your meals.

90
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Finding some new old favorites
Many of the grains that are new to modern society were very familiar to our 
ancestors. The best part about these new old favorites is that you can easily 
add them to your favorite recipes, especially in foods such as hot cereals, 
soups, and rice pilaf dishes. Allow me to introduce you to these oldie-but-
goodie grains:
	
✓	Spelt is an ancient variety of wheat that was common until industri­
alization made it less favorable to farmers than other types of wheat. 
(People who can’t handle wheat should avoid spelt because it’s part of 
the wheat grain family.) Spelt has a higher protein, B vitamin, potassium, 
and iron content than other varieties of wheat, giving it a nutritional 
edge. Multigrain bread made with spelt flour has a glycemic index of 54, 
making it a lower-glycemic bread choice.
	
	You can substitute spelt flour for wheat flour in recipes for cakes, cook­
ies, muffins, pancakes, and even bread. Spelt-flour breads don’t rise as 
high as other wheat-flour breads because spelt has a lower gluten con­
tent, yet they can produce a delicious bread product in their own right. 
Note: Spelt flour doesn’t require as much water as other types of wheat 
flour; start by using three-fourths of the required liquid in a recipe.
	
✓	Buckwheat, familiar in the form of Japanese soba noodles and Russian 
kasha, actually isn’t a form of wheat — it’s really a relative of rhubarb! 
Yet buckwheat, which has a low glycemic index, traditionally has been 
used as a grain in cooking. Because it’s not a member of the grain family, 
people who can’t tolerate wheat can use it without concern. Buckwheat 
is also available as groats, which are the light-brown or light-green soft 
inner seeds of buckwheat. You can add whole groats to soups, or you 
can boil them and eat ’em like rice.
	
	Try using 50 percent buckwheat flour and 50 percent wheat flour in pan­
cakes, muffins, biscuits, and breads for a richer flavor.
	
✓	Quinoa was originally cultivated by the Inca in the Andes Mountains of 
South America. It looks like small kernels of rice and has a higher pro­
tein content than many other types of grains. It contains no gluten and 
can be safely used by people with wheat allergies. Quinoa is delicious in 
soups and grain salads, and it has a lower glycemic index of 53.
	
	Try using a mixture of 25 percent quinoa and 75 percent wheat flour in 
breads, biscuits, and muffins for a highly nutritious bread product with a 
delicious taste. And if you’ve never tasted quinoa before, consider trying 
the Garlic Chicken Stir-Fry with Quinoa recipe in Chapter 18 for a deli­
cious introduction to this ancient grain.

91
 Chapter 7: Adding Low-Glycemic Foods to Your Meals
	
✓	Rye is historically a mainstay in northern European cultures because it 
grows in colder, wet climates. Include rye flakes in homemade granola 
or trail mix for a high-fiber, low-glycemic treat. Note: Rye has less gluten 
than wheat flour, so you need to combine it with other gluten-containing 
flours in order to make bread. Pumpernickel bread made with rye flour 
has a low glycemic index of 55.
	
✓	Wild rice isn’t really rice but rather the seed of a grass that grows in 
water around the Great Lakes in the Midwestern part of the United 
States. It has twice the protein and fiber of brown rice, which gives it a 
lower glycemic index of 45.
	
✓	Barley was domesticated even before wheat. It contains more fiber and 
vitamin E than wheat and adds a nutty flavor to baked products such as 
muffins and biscuits. Pearl barley has the hard outside hull removed and 
cooks quickly into a soft, fluffy grain with a glycemic index of only 25. 
Try adding barley flakes to hot cereal for breakfast or mixing them into 
your favorite granola. (For a satisfying winter meal that features pearl 
barley, try the Vegetable, Barley, and Turkey Soup recipe in Chapter 18.)
	
	Because barley contains less gluten than wheat, use 50 percent barley 
flour and 50 percent wheat flour when baking bread.
	
✓	Bulgur (cracked wheat) is a quick-cooking form of whole wheat that has 
been cleansed, parboiled, dried, and ground into particles. Because it’s 
precooked, you need only pour boiling water over it, cover, and let it 
sit for about ten minutes. It cooks so quickly that adding this delicious, 
healthy, low-glycemic whole grain to your family’s meals is easy. Bulgur 
has a low glycemic index of 48, and one cup of it has fewer calories yet 
more than twice the fiber of rice! It’s also a good source of manganese 
and B vitamins.
	
	Use bulgur as a replacement for rice in your favorite pilaf.
Scoping out the best breads
It’s a given that the soft, squishy white bread that’s often a favorite of chil­
dren has a higher glycemic index. Whole-grain breads, especially those that 
incorporate seeds, sprouted grains, or flaxmeal into their ingredients, have a 
lower glycemic index, but they aren’t always popular choices.
	
When purchasing low-glycemic bread, follow these tips:
	
✓	Watch for the word whole in the first ingredient on the list of ingredients 
in fine print at the bottom of the nutrition facts label.

92
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
✓	Look at the nutrition facts label for the grams of fiber per serving, which 
is usually one slice of bread. Breads that are higher in fiber typically 
have a lower glycemic index. (A food with 5 grams or more of fiber per 
serving is considered a high-fiber food.)
	
✓	Look for breads that contain rye or buckwheat flours, two grains that 
have a lower glycemic index number.
Several low-glycemic breads are now on the market. Some are made with 
sprouted grains that have already started to germinate, which lowers their 
glycemic effect. Ezekiel 4:9 bread is probably the best-known bread that’s 
made from a variety of sprouted grains as well as legumes. Other breads con­
tain added soy protein or have a higher fiber content than more traditional 
types of bread. Resistant starch, a form of starch that digests much more 
slowly, can also be added to some commercial bread products.
	
If you’re looking for alternatives to soft white bread, which typically has a 
high glycemic index of 75, look for Food for Life’s Original Ezekiel 4:9 Organic 
Sprouted Whole Grain Bread and Sprouted 100% Whole Grain Flourless 
Cinnamon Raisin Bread (find them at www.foodforlife.com). Also check 
out Natural Ovens Hunger Filler Bread, which is low-glycemic and loaded with 
wheat bran, wheat germ, oats, flaxseed, and sesame seeds. Your local bakery 
may also produce breads made with whole or sprouted grains, so don’t hesi­
tate to ask.
If you enjoy baking your own bread, you have numerous options for prepar­
ing delicious low-glycemic breads by incorporating lower-glycemic ingredi­
ents. Note: You’ll need to use some whole-wheat flour to provide sufficient 
gluten to allow the bread to rise. Experiment with rye, buckwheat, or spelt 
flour, and add in fiber with ground flaxseeds, barley flakes, or steel-cut oats. 
King Arthur Flour (www.kingarthurflour.com) has several different 
whole-grain, lower-glycemic types of flour, including an Ancient Grains Flour 
Blend that contains 10 percent quinoa flour. Bob’s Red Mill (www.bobsred
mill.com) is another well-known provider of whole-grain flour for baking, 
including a 10 Grain Flour that contains whole-grain wheat, rye, oats, barley, 
and flaxseed. Both Web sites also provide whole-grain bread recipes.
Picking the right pastas
Many people believe that pasta has a high glycemic index. Au contraire! 
Spaghetti made from white durum wheat, the most prevalent type of pasta 
available, has a glycemic index of just 44. Macaroni has a similar low glyce­
mic index of 47. So why all the fuss about pasta? The problem is that people 
confuse the glycemic index with the total amount of carbohydrates in the 
pasta and the amount of pasta they usually eat.

93
 Chapter 7: Adding Low-Glycemic Foods to Your Meals
A recommended serving size of pasta is 1⁄2 cup of cooked pasta, which is the 
amount you can hold in one cupped hand. If you were served that amount 
at an Italian restaurant, you’d most likely demand your money back! Most 
people eat 2 cups of pasta for a meal. That amount of, say, spaghetti has a 
glycemic load of 26, whereas the glycemic load of a 1⁄2-cup serving of spaghetti 
is only 7. See what a difference the amount of food you eat makes?
Add seafood, grilled chicken, or grilled vegetables along with some grated 
cheese to your pasta, and the total glycemic load falls even further. Filled 
whole-grain pasta, such as whole-grain tortellini with cheese, has a lower gly­
cemic load even before you add anything to it.
	
Some pasta manufacturers are now adding soy protein to their pasta, which 
increases the nutritional value and decreases the glycemic index. The 
Dreamfields brand uses technology to make most of the carbohydrates in its 
pasta nondigestible, meaning it doesn’t raise blood sugar levels as high as 
you’d expect from a similar amount of traditional pasta.
	
Here’s a three-step plan for choosing the healthiest, lowest-glycemic pasta out 
there:
	
1.	Look for whole-grain or protein-enriched pasta that tends to have 
a lower glycemic index, or choose a pasta that’s filled with cheese, 
chicken, and/or vegetables for an overall lower glycemic load.
	
2.	Eat no more than 1 cup of cooked pasta in a sitting.
	
3.	Add protein such as chicken or fish and at least 2 cups of cooked veg­
etables to your plate.
	
	The pasta should cover only one-quarter of your plate.
Upping Your Servings of 
Fruits and Vegetables
Almost 90 percent of Americans don’t eat sufficient quantities of fruits and 
vegetables to promote overall good health, yet these are some of the most 
nutritious, low-calorie (and low-glycemic!) foods available. Packed with 
vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables should make up about half the 
volume of every meal. An easy way to measure this is to divide your plate in 
half. Fill one half of your plate with vegetables and fruit and fill the other half 
with lean protein and whole grains.
The next sections explain how to bulk up your meals without adding tons of 
calories and offer tips for adding low-glycemic fruits and veggies to your diet 
to promote weight loss.

94
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Adding volume to your meals
Because fruits and vegetables are high in water and good sources of fiber, 
they provide volume to your meals. Many people feel more satisfied with a 
large, heaping plate of food as opposed to what looks like a tiny portion float­
ing in the middle of a large dinner plate. Visualize this example: You want 
an afternoon snack, and you decide to make a healthy choice — fruit. If you 
want to eat no more than 100 calories for this snack, what amount of grapes 
(which are high in water and a good source of fiber) or raisins (which have 
a very low water content but are still high in fiber) should you eat? For 100 
calories, you could enjoy 1⁄4 cup of raisins or almost 2 cups of grapes. Which 
portion looks more satisfying to you?
Research by Barbara Rolls, PhD and the author of The Volumetrics Weight-
Control Plan, shows that eating low-calorie, high-volume foods help you 
eat fewer total calories and still feel full and satisfied. The reason for this 
increased fullness is energy density, or the amount of calories in a specific 
amount of food. To calculate energy density the official way, divide the calo­
ries in a serving of food by the weight of that food in grams.
	
No, you don’t need to carry a calculator with you to the grocery store to cal­
culate energy density. Here’s the simple way to figure it out: If the calories in 
a food are less than the weight in grams, then that food has an energy density 
below 1, which means it’s a low-energy-density food that provides volume 
and fullness with fewer calories. Most fruit and vegetables, skim milk, and 
broth-based soups fall into this category. If the calories in a food are twice 
the weight in grams, then the food has an energy density of at least 2, which 
means it’s a medium-energy-dense food. Meat, cheese, and salad dressings fall 
into this category.
	
Because fruits and vegetables have a low energy density, and because many 
fruits and vegetables also have a low or medium glycemic index, building your 
meals and snacks around these foods is a smart move. For instance, a big 
tossed salad becomes lunch with the addition of grilled chicken, and vegeta­
ble stir-fries with small amounts of seafood or lean pork can contain up to four 
times the amount of vegetables as rice for a satisfying, low-glycemic meal.
Using fruits and veggies as 
your top weight-loss tools
Low-glycemic fruits and vegetables can keep you feeling fuller longer and 
for fewer calories, making them the perfect foods for weight loss. The vast 
majority of fruits and vegetables are low-glycemic, but feel free to refer to 
Appendix A for some specific low-glycemic recommendations.

95
 Chapter 7: Adding Low-Glycemic Foods to Your Meals
	
Make sure fruits and veggies play a starring role in your snacks and meals. 
Here are several ideas to get you started:
	
✓	Add chopped fresh vegetables to cooked cereal for breakfast and skip 
drinking juice.
	
✓	Add a variety of chopped, dark green, leafy vegetables or leftover 
cooked vegetables to an omelet for breakfast or even a fast lunch.
	
✓	Choose broth-based soups that contain lots of vegetables as an appe­
tizer or add small amounts of lean meat or chicken for a satisfying and 
complete meal.
	
✓	Keep a bowl of fresh fruit on the counter. (It’s amazing what you’ll 
choose for snacks if healthy options are right in front of you!)
	
✓	Have a bowl of clean, cut-up raw vegetables in the fridge, ready for grab-
and-go snacking.
	
✓	Keep the number 3 in mind for dinner: 1 = a cooked vegetable, 2 = a raw 
vegetable, such as sliced tomatoes or a raw vegetable salad, and 3 = fruit 
for dessert, such as sliced apples or a bowl of fresh berries.
	
Perhaps making veggies a priority in your diet is difficult due to horrible 
childhood memories where you had to stay at the dinner table until you 
finished your spinach. If that’s the case, you can find help enjoying veggies 
again with these tips:
	
✓	Try, try, and try again. It takes many people 15 to 20 times of sampling a 
food before it becomes “okay” to their taste buds.
	
✓	Use different preparation methods. Don’t like veggies raw? Then boil 
’em. Can’t stand sautéed veggies? Try steaming them instead. You may 
even find that a little spray butter, seasoning, or dip helps transform a 
formerly unpleasant veggie into something palatable to you.
	
✓	Explore the unknown. Are there any veggies you’ve never tried? Then 
make an effort to purchase one uncommon veggie (or fruit, for that 
matter) each time you go to the grocery store. Discovering how to pre­
pare this food and the benefits you get from eating it is something you 
can involve the kids in as well.
Broadening Your Taste Buds’ 
Horizons with Beans
Beans in this sense are actually legumes, a class of vegetables that includes 
dry beans, peas, and lentils. Legumes are available in two forms: canned or 
dried. Simply rinse canned legumes such as garbanzo beans, black beans, 
or navy beans under cold running water and they’re ready to add to your 
favorite recipe. (Adding canned beans to soup is simple and delicious; try 

96
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
the White Bean and Chicken Chili recipe in Chapter 18 and see for yourself!) 
Dried beans require soaking and precooking before use.
The following sections reveal what makes legumes so good for you and how 
to enjoy them without upsetting your stomach.
Reaping the many benefits of legumes
If you’ve ever enjoyed baked beans, lentil soup, or meatless chili, you’ve 
reaped the benefits of legumes, which include
	
✓	Low fat content
	
✓	High fiber content
	
✓	A good source of protein
	
✓	Essential nutrients such as iron, potassium, folate, and magnesium
	
✓	A low glycemic index
	
Dried beans and peas are great substitutes for meat because they provide 
protein and fiber without the cholesterol. The American Heart Association 
recommends substituting beans for meat on a regular basis to lower the risk 
of heart disease. Adding fiber to your diet in the form of legumes can also help 
decrease the risk of cancer.
Avoiding digestive discomfort by slowly 
adding legumes to your diet
	
Legumes contain more fiber than any other type of food. Because of this, the 
body can’t fully digest them, which can sometimes lead to gas and bloating.
The best way to avoid any legume-induced digestive discomfort is to gradu­
ally add legumes to your meals. Start with small portions of legumes once a 
week and gradually increase the amount you use over a period of weeks. Try 
these suggestions to experiment with legumes:
	
✓	Add 1⁄4 cup of garbanzo beans to your favorite tossed salad.
	
✓	Use 1⁄4 cup of lentils or split peas in a rice pilaf recipe.
	
✓	Include kidney beans in your favorite spaghetti sauce.
	
✓	Add mashed pinto beans to tacos or enchiladas.
	
Make sure to also drink more water when you eat legumes to help improve 
digestion.

to help it out one of the fundamentals of any weight-loss plan.
Numerous factors influence a person’s metabolic rate, which means every­
one’s metabolic rate is different. Have you ever been on the same diet plan as 
your friend or relative and seen her drop the pounds quickly while you lose 
weight at a snail’s pace? This is because your metabolic rates are different. If 
you feel like you’re on the slow end of the metabolism pole, don’t worry. No 
matter what the circumstances, you can increase your metabolic rate, and 
you can do so in a variety of ways.
This chapter covers the various factors that affect your metabolism. It also 
presents ways to optimize your metabolic rate and behaviors that can lower 
your metabolism so you can avoid giving in to them.
Understanding Basal Metabolic Rate
Your basal metabolic rate, abbreviated as BMR and commonly referred to 
simply as metabolic rate, is the amount of calories your body burns at rest for 
basic functioning. Every time you breathe, eat, sleep, or just sit down, your 
body is using a constant stream of energy.

Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
If you’ve ever followed a calculation that tells you the estimated calories you 
should eat for weight loss, then you’re probably quite familiar with feeling 
either like you’re not getting enough calories to function properly or like 
you just can’t lose the weight no matter how hard you work at maintaining 
the ideal calorie level. Such calorie calculations often fall short because they 
don’t leave room for differences in people’s metabolic rates. Sure, some 
of them are better than others because they take factors such as age and 
gender into account, but they’re never completely accurate.
The following sections cover some of the factors affecting your metabolic 
rate in detail and help you determine the best way to calculate your meta­
bolic rate.
Looking at metabolism influences 
that are largely out of your control
Many of the factors that affect metabolism are pretty much out of your con­
trol. Following is an in-depth look at these factors so you have a better idea of 
what’s working for you and what’s working against you:
	
✓	Age: Your metabolic rate is highest during infancy because a baby’s 
energy needs are so great. The teenage years also feature a high meta­
bolic rate. (Have you ever seen teenage boys eat? Sometimes you can 
watch in awe as they pack away thousands of calories and never gain a 
pound.) As you get older, your metabolic rate begins to decline because 
your body no longer needs massive amounts of energy to support your 
physical and mental growth.
	
	By the time you reach adulthood, around 25 years of age, your metabolic 
rate starts to decline about 2 to 5 percent every decade. For example, a 
24-year-old woman may need about 2,000 calories, but by the time she 
turns 35, she’ll only need 1,960 calories. At age 45, she’ll only need 1,920 
calories. Some people feel this change after they hit their 30s, but most 
folks don’t until they hit their 40s and 50s and notice that gaining weight 
has become much easier and losing that weight has become a little more 
challenging.
	
✓	Genetics: Your genetic makeup and body shape can also affect your 
metabolism. For example, a person with a tall, thin frame may experience 
more heat loss than someone with a short, petite build, resulting in a 
higher metabolic rate to maintain normal body temperature.
	
✓	Gender: It’s sad but true — men have it a little better when it comes to 
metabolic rate. They’re naturally taller than women, and they have more 
surface area and more muscle mass — all of which results in higher met­
abolic rates. This is why it often seems like men can lose weight a little 
easier than many women. (Of course, you may find that isn’t always the 
case, but it usually works out that way.)

99
 Chapter 8: Raising the Bar on Your Metabolism
	
	Women tend to store more fat than muscle as a natural reserve for preg­
nancy and breast-feeding. With this fact in mind, it’s a good idea for 
women to observe whether they tend to eat the same amount of food as 
their male companions. Because men naturally burn more, they can (and 
should!) have larger portion sizes than women.
	
✓	Your environment: If you live in a geographical area that’s very cold or 
very hot, you naturally require more calories to normalize your body 
temperature, just like your house furnace or air conditioning has to use 
energy to bring the temperature in your home to a comfortable level. So 
if you’re enduring say, a long Michigan winter or a hot Arizona summer, 
get excited!
	
✓	Your health: Several health conditions can also affect your metabolic 
rate. Hypothyroidism is probably the largest culprit in lowering a per­
son’s metabolic rate. (Many individuals with other health issues, such as 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome [PCOS], often get hypothyroidism.) This slow­
down in natural metabolic rate can make weight loss more challenging.
	
Although most of these factors are largely out of your control, you do have 
control over plenty of other factors. I present those factors, as well as strate­
gies for increasing your metabolism, later in this chapter.
Measuring your metabolic rate
Obtaining an accurate metabolic rate is extremely difficult because numerous 
factors (including eating, movement, and temperature) can affect the results. 
Many methods exist for calculating your metabolic rate, but one of the best 
ways to get an accurate measurement of it is to use equipment that measures 
your resting metabolic rate (similar to your BMR) by examining your oxygen 
input and carbon dioxide output. Several hand-held devices are available 
today for the public, but these can be cost prohibitive and not as accurate.
	
To determine your personal metabolic rate for much less, ask a health profes­
sional for a one-time test. Contact your local fitness center or registered dieti­
cian for recommendations.
If you’re measuring your metabolism (or calorie needs) with a calculation, 
make sure the calculation you’re working with takes the following into 
account for a more accurate estimate:
	
✓	Your age
	
✓	Your gender
	
✓	Your activity level

100
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
A classic calculation for determining one’s metabolic rate is the Harris 
Benedict Equation. It may seem like quite a bit of math, but it’s really rather 
simple to complete. See for yourself.
BMR Calculation for Women
655 + (4.35 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches) – (4.7 × age in 
years)
BMR Calculation for Men
66 + (6.23 × weight in pounds) + (12.7 × height in inches) – (6.76 × age in 
years)
To really determine your body’s energy needs, you should also account 
for how often you exercise. Table 8-1 shows you how to adjust the Harris 
Benedict Equation to account for your physical activity level.
Table 8-1	
Factoring Exercise into the BMR Equation
Amount of Exercise
Daily Calories Needed
Little to no exercise
BMR × 1.2
Light exercise (1 to 3 days per week)
BMR × 1.375
Moderate exercise (3 to 5 days per week)
BMR × 1.55
Heavy exercise (6 to 7 days per week)
BMR × 1.725
Very heavy exercise (intense workouts twice per day)
BMR × 1.9
	
The number you just calculated is the amount of calories it’d take to maintain 
your current weight based on your age, height, weight, gender, and physical 
activity level. So if weight loss is your goal, try to cut out anywhere from 200 
to 500 calories per day to achieve a .5- to 1-pound weight loss per week.
Using your metabolic rate 
as a weight-loss tool
Consider your metabolic rate a guideline of how easily you can lose weight. If 
you have a low metabolic rate, you need to eat a lower calorie level in order 
to lose weight. If your metabolic rate is higher, then you don’t have to be as 
restrictive.

101
 Chapter 8: Raising the Bar on Your Metabolism
Here’s an example: Susie has a metabolic rate of 1,200 calories. When you 
add in Susie’s moderate activity level, you find that she needs 1,600 calories 
per day to maintain her weight. To lose weight, Susie would need to cut her 
calorie intake by 250 to 500 calories, leaving her with a total of 1,100 to 1,350 
calories per day. That’s a very low calorie range and is difficult to maintain 
for long.
To keep yourself from having to maintain an unrealistic calorie intake, I sug­
gest you boost your metabolic rate by increasing your activity level. Doing so 
allows you to enjoy a normal lifestyle while losing weight. So if Susie pumped 
up her activity level by using some of the strategies I share later in this chap­
ter, she could increase her metabolic rate to 1,500 calories. Adding in Susie’s 
increased activity level brings her to a maintenance level of 1,950 calories 
and a weight-loss range of between 1,450 and 1,700 calories — much more 
doable!
	
Although knowing your metabolic rate can help you determine how many 
calories you need to lose or maintain your weight, that isn’t necessary. It’s 
always better to focus on action goals and lifestyle changes than numbers. 
The best thing you can do is engage in activities that maximize your metabolic 
rate so that losing weight comes easily as you follow a low-glycemic weight-
loss plan.
Simple Strategies for Increasing 
Your Metabolic Rate
Pumping up your muscle mass. Increasing the amount of activity in your day-
to-day life. These are just two of the many actions you can take to kick your 
metabolism into gear. As you go through each of the sections that follow, 
start thinking about how you can incorporate the new strategies into your 
lifestyle. The beauty of the following strategies is that you can pick a few 
of them or the whole shebang. Create your own metabolism makeover that 
works for you.
	
Weight loss is a holistic approach. So while you’re getting your blood sugar 
under control with your new low-glycemic food choices, you should also begin 
optimizing your metabolic rate — a real win-win combination for weight loss.
Building lean muscle mass
Most people go straight for the cardio exercises when they embark on a 
weight-loss program, not realizing that building up lean body mass is essen­
tial for boosting metabolism. Muscle burns up to 90 percent more calories 

102
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
than fat. So the more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn in a 
day. By adding 3 to 5 pounds of lean body mass, you can actually burn 100 to 
250 additional calories a day. Not too shabby, huh?
Building lean body mass doesn’t mean you need to do bench presses or look 
like a body builder. All you have to do is start incorporating strength-training 
exercises into your routine until you’re doing them two to three times a 
week. A wide variety of strength-training activities is available to you, includ­
ing simple day-to-day tasks like carrying your groceries home.
	
Following are a few strength-training activities you can try; pick one or two out 
of the list and add them as goals:
	
✓	Weight lifting: This is the most obvious and best way to build lean 
muscle mass. If you use the equipment in a gym, be sure to get some 
instructions from a personal trainer to ensure you’re using it appropri­
ately to avoid injuries while maximizing your workout. If you prefer to 
exercise at home, lifting 3- to 5-pound hand weights ten minutes a day 
can go a long way toward building muscle, increasing your metabolic 
rate, and burning more calories. Visit www.acefitness.org for a 
list of certified personal trainers in your area to get you started using 
appropriate techniques. Also check out Weight Training For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, by Liz Neporent, Suzanne Schlosberg, and Shirley J. Archer 
(Wiley) for the basics on safe weight lifting at home or at the gym.
	
✓	Resistance bands: The benefits of using stretchy, rubbery resistance 
bands are that they’re small, inexpensive, fairly easy to use, and good 
for when you’re traveling. You can pick up a set of resistance bands at 
a sporting goods store or at stores such as Target or Wal-Mart; you can 
also order them online. Typically resistance bands come with some 
basic routines you can try. If you want more than that, or if your set 
of bands doesn’t come with routines, just do a simple Internet search 
for “resistance band exercises.” I guarantee you’ll find a whole array of 
activities you can try.
	
✓	Walking: Not a fan of the gym? Well, walking is also a great way to build 
lean muscle mass. The trick with walking is to make sure it’s challenging 
your muscles, so you want to either increase your pace or hit some hills. 
For a change of pace or to make your walking routine even more chal­
lenging, you may want to add a little hiking to your repertoire.
	
✓	Yoga and Pilates: If you’re out of shape, then either yoga or Pilates may 
be a perfect starting place for your journey into strength-training activi­
ties. Both beginner’s yoga and Pilates challenge your muscles as you 
hold your own body weight in poses. If you feel that muscle fatigue, then 
you know the exercise is working for you. However, after you become 
proficient, you may find it to be less effective for you. At this point, I 
recommend trying an advanced-level class so you’re continuing to chal­
lenge your muscles.

Talk to your doctor before diving into any strength-training exercise routines.
Getting your heart rate up
Regular aerobic exercise — which gets your heart pumping faster — helps 
raise your metabolism during the activity and for several hours afterward. By 
adding aerobic activity to your exercise routine three or more times a week, 
you can increase your metabolic rate for eight to ten hours a week.
Aerobic exercise can take on many forms. Whether you regularly run 3 miles 
a day or you’re a beginner just starting a walking program, the important 
thing to remember is to get your heart rate up. Here are some ideas for regu­
lar aerobic exercises:
	
✓	Biking
	
✓	Dancing
	
✓	Interval training (walking a short distance, then running, and then 
switching back to walking)
	
✓	Running/jogging
	
✓	Swimming
	
✓	Taking aerobics or spinning classes
	
✓	Walking
	
Work in your favorite aerobic exercises three or more days a week for at 
least 20 minutes. (Find sticking to an exercise routine rather difficult? Head to 
Chapter 21, where I help you find an exercise plan that works for you.)
	
Be sure to check with your healthcare provider first before starting an exer­
cise program.
Sprinkling in small activities
Any time you can increase your heart rate for even five minutes, you give 
your metabolic rate a small boost. So doing the little things that get your 
heart rate up (like cleaning the house or playing with the kids) for a short 
amount of time provides little rises in your metabolism over the course of 
a day. Those individual little rises add up to help with your weight loss and 
overall wellness.

104
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
If you lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle but do some sort of formalized exercise once 
a day, that’s a good start, but you’re only giving yourself one metabolic boost 
each day. Believe it or not, there are tons of small, daily activities that you can 
easily do to give yourself some extra metabolic boosts. These activities include
	
✓	Housecleaning
	
✓	Gardening
	
✓	Playing with your kids
	
✓	Stretching in the afternoon
	
✓	Doing jumping jacks
	
✓	Practicing some quick yoga poses (such as sun salutations)
	
✓	Dancing to your favorite music while making dinner
	
✓	Taking your dog on an extra walk
	
✓	Doing leg lifts, sit-ups, and/or push-ups
	
✓	Taking the stairs rather than the elevator
	
✓	Parking in the last spot in the lot so you walk more
	
✓	Carrying your groceries to your car rather than using a shopping cart
	
✓	Throwing a ball for your dog in the backyard
	
✓	Tossing a Frisbee or football around on the weekend
	
The more small activities you add, the more your metabolic rate will rise 
throughout the day, each and every day. So keep looking for extra ways you 
can move more during the day to help your body burn more calories. Heck. 
Make a game out of it! Think of the many different ways (including the ones 
Calculating your target heart rate
An easy way to determine whether you need to 
pump it up or slow it down is by monitoring your 
heart rate to see where it’s falling within your 
target range. To calculate your target heart 
rate, you first need to know your maximum 
heart rate (MHR). Find that by subtracting your 
age from 220.
Your target heart rate should be between 65 
and 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. 
To find the lowest number in your target heart 
rate range, multiply your MHR by .65. To find 
the highest number in your range, multiply your 
MHR by .85.
Here’s an example to tie it all together: Barbara 
is 40 years old. That means her MHR is 180 
(220 – 40 = 180). The lowest number in her target 
range is 117 (180 × .65 = 117), and the highest 
number is 153 (180 × .85 = 153). Therefore, 
Barbara’s target heart rate range is between 
117 and 153 beats per minute.

105
 Chapter 8: Raising the Bar on Your Metabolism
from the preceding list) you can incorporate metabolic boosts throughout the 
day. Choose as many of these ideas as you can as part of your master metabo­
lism makeover. You’ll find that adding more small activities to your daily life 
may be the simplest strategy for increasing your metabolic rate.
Eating low-glycemic resistant starches
New research is showing a connection between metabolism and the foods 
you eat, specifically that certain starch-resistant foods increase the body’s 
efficiency at burning stored fat. One study found that replacing just 5.4 per­
cent of total carbohydrate intake with resistant starch created a 20 to 30 
percent increase in fat burning after a meal. The great news about starch-
resistant foods? Several of them are also low-glycemic, making them the per­
fect fit for you.
	
Resistant starches refer to a type of fiber that “resists” being digested. Unlike 
other types of fiber, resistant starch ferments in the large intestine. This fer­
mentation process creates beneficial fatty acids, including one called butyr­
ate, which may block the body’s ability to burn carbohydrates as its main 
source of fuel, causing it to burn stored fat instead. Butyrate has been shown 
to decrease blood sugar and insulin responses, lower plasma cholesterol and 
triglycerides, increase “full” feelings, and reduce fat storage.
Table 8-2 runs through some low-glycemic foods that are also high in resis­
tant starches, as well as ways to enjoy them.
Spicy food lovers can get an extra metabolic boost
Are you one of those people who can’t get your 
Thai food hot enough? Well, you may be get­
ting a little extra metabolic boost thanks to your 
extraspicy food preferences. Various studies 
have shown that compounds in certain spicy 
foods, such as jalapeño peppers, can create 
a small increase in metabolism by raising body 
temperature, but it’s unclear how long this 
effect lasts.
Capsaicin, the compound that gives red chili 
peppers their fiery kick, is shown to provide the 
biggest metabolism boost (followed by black 
pepper and ginger). It can temporarily increase 
metabolism by 8 percent over a person’s normal 
rate. This increase certainly isn’t significant, but 
if you love spicy foods and can tolerate them, 
you may get a little extra metabolism boost for 
that meal.

To get the fat-burning benefits of resistant starches, you must eat them at 
either cool or room temperature. And keep in mind that although low-glycemic 
resistant starches will surely help you burn more calories, manage your blood 
sugar, and help you feel fuller, they aren’t a miracle cure.
Avoiding Behaviors That Lower 
Your Metabolic Rate
Bad eating habits, particularly skipping meals and eating too few calories, 
can seriously set back your efforts to boost your metabolic rate. But they 
don’t have to. You have control over these metabolism-affecting factors. In 
the following sections, I explain what makes these behaviors so bad for you 
and give you some tricks for avoiding them.

107
 Chapter 8: Raising the Bar on Your Metabolism
Skipping meals
Do you ever get caught in the cycle of skipping meals? If so, you’re not alone. 
Everyone these days seems to be on the run, filling their days with work, 
kids, projects, volunteering, and friends. No wonder many people let regular 
meals fall to the wayside!
The problem with continuously skipping meals is that your body begins to 
naturally compensate for this bad behavior. Without you even realizing it, 
your body is decreasing your overall metabolic rate to match these down 
times. (Ever wonder why you sometimes feel less hungry when you skip 
breakfast? Now you know.) You’re also losing out on the little peaks in metab­
olism that come with digestion.
	
Making time for meals is an important aspect of keeping your metabolic rate 
strong. Yet if you’re a notorious meal-skipper, you may need more than that 
knowledge to motivate you to eat regular meals. Following are the benefits of 
not skipping meals — keep ’em in mind to stay motivated:
	
✓	Increased metabolic rate
	
✓	Improved energy levels
	
✓	Decreased fatigue
	
✓	Easier weight loss
	
✓	A better mood
	
✓	Improved concentration
	
If you’re having difficulty making time for meals, follow these few steps to find 
more balance in your day:
	
1.	Take an inventory of your day.
	
	 Look at each hour and where you spend your time. I bet you’ll notice 
you spend most of your time taking care of others’ needs.
	
2.	Find ways to either move your schedule around or simply make more 
time for your meals.
	
	 This step may mean creating a lighter schedule than you’re used to, but 
mealtimes should be just as important as anything else on your sched­
ule. After all, what’s more important than your health? (Plus, eating 
regular meals will give you the energy you need to get through the rest 
of your list!)

108
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Eating too few calories
Eating a very-low-calorie diet can be extremely harmful to your body’s metab­
olism. If you dip too low in your calorie intake, your body simply compen­
sates by decreasing your overall metabolic rate, which can ultimately hinder 
your weight-loss goals.
	
Many weight-loss programs prescribe very-low-calorie diets (1,000 calories 
or less) to help you lose excess pounds. Although your body decreases its 
metabolic rate (described earlier in this chapter) to compensate for this lower 
calorie level, something else happens at the same time. This low calorie level 
may create a situation where your body turns to lean body tissue, or muscle, 
for energy. This decrease in overall lean body mass lowers your metabolic 
rate even further.
Consider this example: Sally had recently gained weight and wanted to get 
the excess pounds off. Her metabolic rate was 2,500 calories per day, which 
means she was consuming around 2,500 calories each day to maintain her 
current weight. Sally turned to a popular diet program, which estimated her 
daily calories at 1,000 (without accounting for daily activity). The result? 
Sally lost 10 pounds in two weeks and was absolutely thrilled. She kept up 
with the diet for about a month, losing roughly 3 pounds of lean muscle 
mass (not good), along with body fat, and decreasing her metabolic rate in 
response to the lower calorie level (even worse!).
Sally’s metabolic rate used to be 2,500 calories; now it has decreased to 
approximately 2,000 calories. When Sally goes back to her old eating habits, 
which were landing her on an average of 2,500 calories consumed per day, 
she’ll gain her old weight back plus more.
	
To avoid falling into the trap of eating too few calories, remember this: You 
still have to eat in order to lose weight. Yes, this statement may go against all 
other dieting concepts you’ve encountered, but you’re seeking a long-term 
weight-loss solution, not a short-term fad diet.
	
Maintaining a food journal (covered in Chapter 6) can be a great way of check­
ing your food intake. It also gives you a record that you can share with a regis­
tered dietician or nutritional professional to make sure you’re getting enough 
calories to support your weight-loss efforts.

nowing and feeling comfortable applying simple healthy-eating strate­
gies can mean the difference between giving up and finding weight-loss 
success. Why? Because after you have a few rules down you can apply them 
to any situation and make them work in your lifestyle. You know the old 
saying “you can give someone a fish or teach him how to fish so he can have 
fish for life”? Eating a balanced, low-glycemic diet works just the same way. 
Sure, I could give you a book of menus to follow, but I’d prefer to give you 
some simple healthy-eating strategies so you can use them in any scenario 
you might experience.
This chapter delves into a few basic healthy-eating strategies that can help 
you benefit from low-glycemic foods, keep your calorie level in a good range, 
and get your food cravings under control — all without you having to count 
calories or solve awful math equations whenever you want to eat something. 
After you know these tricks of the trade by heart and start practicing them, 
they’ll become second nature to you.
	
The purpose for simplifying healthy-eating strategies is twofold: so you can get 
the results you’re looking for by decreasing your glycemic load and your calorie 
level and so you can make your new diet changes work easily in your life.

Tips for Choosing Low-Glycemic Foods
The goal of healthy eating on a low-glycemic diet is to balance your food 
choices every day, even when your days are hectic. Well, when life gets busy 
and you start depending on high-glycemic grab-and-go foods, you’ll prob­
ably find yourself saying, “I’ll get back on track tomorrow.” But that behavior 
counteracts all of your weight-loss efforts. I’m not saying you should eat 
all low-glycemic carbs all the time. Instead, I want you to feel comfortable 
choosing them most of the time (meaning at least one low-glycemic food per 
meal) while balancing your intake of medium- to high-glycemic foods. This 
two-pronged approach can help you stay on track whether you’re at home, 
on vacation, or out to lunch with friends. The following sections cover a few 
quick tips for making the best low-glycemic food choices.
Get acquainted with the 
glycemic index list
Take the time to become familiar with the glycemic index by reviewing one 
or more of the lists that are readily available (see Chapter 7 for one specific 
Web site you can seek out). The glycemic index list is your starting point 
because it can familiarize you with what foods have a low, medium, and high 
glycemic index. You’ll need to focus at first to pick up on which foods are 
low-glycemic and which ones are medium- and high-glycemic, but soon you’ll 
have memorized the glycemic nature of the foods you eat the most and you 
won’t need to depend on the list as much.
	
When in doubt, always keep in mind that using low-glycemic foods in modera­
tion gives you great benefits.
Pay attention to portion sizes
Following the low-glycemic list of foods is simply following a low-glycemic 
diet. Following a low-glycemic diet for weight loss requires closer attention to 
the all-important portion size. Even if you’re regularly choosing low-glycemic 
foods and balancing them with medium- and high-glycemic foods, if you don’t 
pay attention to your portion sizes, you may never lose weight. Here’s why:
	
✓	The glycemic load of a food typically increases when you eat larger 
amounts.
	
✓	Your calorie level for the day is determined mostly by the portion sizes 
you eat.

111
 Chapter 9: Presenting Foolproof Healthy-Eating Strategies
The tricky thing is that the portion sizes used for glycemic index testing may 
be a little different than the typical recommended portion sizes for calorie 
control. Glycemic index testing uses very small amounts of food, so when you 
eat more, the glycemic load also increases. (I cover glycemic load and what 
makes it different from the glycemic index in Chapter 4.)
	
You can generally gauge that if a food’s glycemic load is very low, it likely won’t 
go up too much if you decide to eat more of that food. If the glycemic load is 
near medium or already in the medium category, then it’ll go up from there.
Of course, you also need to retrain your brain to recognize appropriate por­
tion sizes of different foods for calorie control. Portions in today’s restau­
rants have increased so much that the new, larger sizes have become normal 
in most people’s perceptions. But eating those jumbo-sized portions regu­
larly is a surefire way to sabotage your weight-loss efforts and up the overall 
glycemic load of your meal. Use Table 9-1 as a general reference for scaling 
back your brain’s mental image of the appropriate portion size.
	
A good exercise to help you get your portion sizes under control is to measure 
your food for one day so you can see what the actual portion sizes should look 
like on your plate. You don’t have to be perfect and measure your food every 
day (that’s no way to live your life). Measuring your food for just one day gives 
you enough of an idea of how much to put on your plate.
Keep the glycemic load of 
your meal at or under 25
	
If you feel more comfortable tracking numbers and having some guidelines to 
work toward, then this advice is for you: Strive to consume a maximum glyce­
mic load of 25 per meal. Doing so allows you a good variety of carbohydrates 
for your meal including grains, vegetables, fruits, and/or dairy products.
Here’s what one possible under-25-glycemic-load meal looks like:
1⁄2 turkey sandwich on whole-wheat bread with a slice of cheddar cheese, 
tomato, lettuce, and sliced avocado (glycemic load of whole-wheat bread = 8)
1 cup of tomato soup (glycemic load = 8)
8 ounces of fruit yogurt (glycemic load = 7)
The total estimated glycemic load for this meal is 23.

Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Note: Sometimes you may not find a glycemic load for certain foods like 
cheese or avocado. When that happens, it’s okay to guess at the foods’ dif­
ferent glycemic loads. (Appendix A notes the glycemic load of several go-to 
foods for your reference.) In this case, you can guess that the glycemic load 
for cheese is low because milk has both a similar makeup to cheese and a 
very low glycemic load. Avocado has too little carbohydrate in it to obtain a 
glycemic load measurement.
The variety of carbohydrates available paired with portion control makes 
keeping the glycemic load of your meals under 25 an easily attainable goal . . . 
unless of course you’re indulging in large amounts of medium- or high-
glycemic foods. Watch out for traditional meal combinations such as 
spaghetti and garlic bread or pizza and breadsticks that can make 
maintaining a glycemic load of 25 or less difficult.

up to 25 to your heart’s content!
Changing the Balance of Your Meals
Discovering how to balance the nutrients in your meals is an essential part of 
losing weight successfully on a low-glycemic diet. For a diet to be truly bal­
anced it must contain a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can also 
think of balance in terms of food groups: starches, fruits, vegetables, meat 
and beans, and dairy and fats. When you incorporate a variety of food groups 
into your meals, you help stabilize your blood sugar and supply your body 
with a more complete nutritional load of vitamins and minerals.
Eating balanced meals is clearly a great approach to long-term weight loss. 
And the best part? The rules are simple enough that you don’t have to put 
too much thought into it at mealtime, nor do you need to break out the calcu­
lator whenever you eat.
In the following sections, I describe the role of important nutrients and delve 
into the details of why keeping them balanced is so beneficial. I also share 
with you a simple strategy for balancing your nutrient intake at any meal, 
whether you’re at home, on vacation, or in a restaurant. Finally, I present a 
couple menus that show you just how easy it can be to balance your nutri­
ents at each meal.

114
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Understanding different nutrients’ roles 
and the benefits of balance
To really appreciate the value of balancing your nutrient intake at each meal, 
it helps to know some basic facts about proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
	
✓	Proteins are crucial for building body tissues, regulating hormones, 
and pumping up your immune system. Additionally, they provide a 
longer release of energy than carbohydrates, helping you to feel more 
satisfied when you eat them. Incorporate one serving of lean meats 
(such as poultry, fish, or beef) or other high-protein foods (such as soy, 
beans, eggs, or nuts) with each meal. For help determining the appropri­
ate portion size, see the earlier “Pay attention to portion sizes” section.
	
✓	Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy. Eating low-
glycemic carbohydrates helps keep your blood sugar steady and makes 
for a more sustained energy release. The amount of carbohydrates you 
need really depends on your activity level and metabolism. For weight 
loss, women should have two servings of starchy carbohydrates from 
whole grains and at least one fruit or vegetable serving each meal; men 
should have three servings of starchy carbs from whole grains and the 
same minimum amount of fruits and veggies per meal.
	
✓	Fats can also be used for energy, but their primary task is to aid nutri­
ent transport and cell functioning. Fats have a slower energy release, 
allowing you to feel more satisfied with your meal for a longer period of 
time. Use small amounts of fat for cooking and preparing cold foods, but 
don’t feel like you have to include it at each meal. Always remember that 
a little fat goes a long way. Healthy fats include avocadoes, nuts, fish, 
olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, and olives.
	
	The tricky part about dietary fat and weight loss is twofold: When 
people are overweight, they can store fat more readily because they 
have increased levels of the fat-storing enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, 
which transfers food fat from the bloodstream to fat cells. As you may 
already know, fat contains 9 calories per gram compared to just 4 calo­
ries per gram for protein and carbohydrates. Thus, fat adds extra calo­
ries. This combination of fat storage and extra calories can make weight 
loss difficult for individuals consuming too much fat in their diets.
Balancing your intake of protein, carbs, and fat at each meal does many great 
things for your body, not least of which are
	
✓	Helping control your total calorie level (because you’re eating more low-
calorie foods)
	
✓	Keeping your blood sugar stable to avoid stimulating your appetite and 
storing more calories as fat
	
✓	Helping control your food cravings

115
 Chapter 9: Presenting Foolproof Healthy-Eating Strategies
	
✓	Keeping you feeling full and satisfied
	
✓	Supporting your mood to avoid emotional-eating triggers
	
On the other hand, unbalanced consumption of protein, carbs, and fat can 
lead to
	
✓	Unstable blood sugar that can stimulate your appetite and lead you to 
eat more
	
✓	A cycle of food cravings
	
✓	Not feeling satisfied, which may cause you to overeat
	
✓	An increase in your total calorie intake because you’re eating too many 
high-calorie foods
	
✓	Emotional-eating cycles
The negative effects of not balancing your nutrients can creep up on you 
quite quickly. For instance, if you eat too much fat at one meal, your calorie 
level will increase rapidly. On the other hand, if you eat too many carbo­
hydrates, you may experience blood sugar spikes that can lead you to feel 
starving an hour later, possibly creating a situation where you store more 
calories as body fat. Eating the right balance of fat and carbohydrates (and 
protein!) keeps your blood sugar and calorie level under control all the time.
Embracing the plate method
The plate method is a fabulous way of balancing your nutrients because it 
divides your plate into subsections so you know how much to eat of each 
food group. The idea is to fill your plate with the good, lower-calorie food, 
leaving only a small amount of room for the foods you should limit — fats 
and high-glycemic foods. According to the plate method, half of your plate 
should be filled with fruits and/or veggies, one-quarter with a protein source 
(such as meat, fish, or poultry), and one-quarter with a low-glycemic starch 
or grain (such as barley or whole-grain bread). Figure 9-1 provides a template 
of the plate method that you can easily follow.
When people overeat, they tend to do so with starchy carbohydrates (grains, 
potatoes, breads, and the like) and meats (beef, poultry, fish, and so on). 
These are high-calorie food groups where a lot of excess calories come from. 
The starchy carbohydrates also create the blood sugar spikes that you want 
to avoid. Using the plate method allows you to better control your consump­
tion of these two food categories each meal so you get the perfect balance of 
carbohydrates and protein.

Many dinner plates nowadays are huge. In fact, they’re really more like plat­
ters. My dinner plates don’t even fit into a standard-size cupboard anymore, 
and I even have to lean them forward in my dishwasher. If you have the 
same situation with your dinner plates, don’t strictly follow the plate method 
because you can all too easily pack a lot of food on those enormous plates. 
Instead, try measuring out the appropriate portion sizes of different foods to 
see what a portion of each food group looks like on your size of plates. After 
you have a rough idea, you can estimate from there on out.
	
If the portion sizes on your big plates look very small and make you feel like you’re 
depriving yourself with dieting, try using the plate method with your smaller salad 
or dessert plates. Because of their smaller size, they’ll look like they’re chock-full of 
food even though they’re holding the same amount as the larger plates did. If you 
have an old set of china, you can also try using one of the dinner plates from that 
set because the plate size is more normal than today’s monster plates.
With that in mind, it’s time to see the plate method in action! Tables 9-2, 9-3, and 
9-4 demonstrate how to use the plate method with three classic meal options.

Everything at restaurants is bigger, even something as simple as a sandwich, 
which is why the calorie level is so high for restaurant meals. Have that to-go 
box ready to help you portion your meal to a more realistic size. (Flip to 
Chapter 11 for some additional guidelines for dining out.)
Putting it all together with sample menus
Using the plate method to balance your nutrient intake and eating the right 
portion sizes are guaranteed to make a big difference in your weight-loss 
efforts. The following sections offer sample breakfast, lunch, and dinner 
menus that illustrate all of these strategies put together.
Sample breakfast menu
Start the day off right with a balanced, filling breakfast (and yes, I mean more 
than just coffee in a to-go cup). Here’s a simple on-the-go breakfast menu you 
can readily enjoy:
Peanut-Butter Monkey Smoothie (1 cup milk, one frozen banana, 1 table­
spoon reduced-fat peanut butter)
1 slice whole-grain bread

118
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
In this example,
	
✓	The milk provides a nice balance of a low-glycemic carbohydrate with a 
moderate amount of protein.
	
✓	The banana provides low-glycemic carbohydrates and one full serving of 
fruit.
	
✓	The peanut butter serves as a fat source and a source of protein.
	
✓	The whole-grain bread is a low-glycemic starch.
This meal has an estimated glycemic load of 25 and an estimated 367 calo­
ries. Even though it doesn’t go on a plate, it fits the plate method presented 
earlier in this chapter because it provides a nice balance of carbohydrates, 
protein, and fat.
Sample lunch menu
This sample lunch menu illustrates how easy it is to eat a balanced yet tasty lunch:
Tuna sandwich (two slices whole-wheat bread, 3 ounces tuna, 1 teaspoon 
mayonnaise)
Side salad (2 cups mixed greens, five cherry tomatoes, 1 tablespoon 
lowfat vinaigrette salad dressing)
In this example,
	
✓	The tuna counts as a serving of protein.
	
✓	The mayonnaise counts as a serving of fat.
	
✓	The whole-wheat bread makes up two servings of low-glycemic whole 
grains.
	
✓	The salad features low-glycemic vegetables.
	
✓	The salad dressing adds another half-serving of fat.
This meal has an estimated glycemic load of 20 and an estimated 430 calo­
ries. The combination of low-glycemic grains, high fiber, protein, and fat 
helps you feel comfortably full for a longer period of time while avoiding 
major insulin spikes that may cause you to store fat more readily.
Sample dinner menu
Balancing your nutrients at dinner works the same way as at lunch. Following 
is a sample dinner menu that incorporates balance along with appropriate 
portion sizes:
4-ounce grilled chicken breast
2⁄3 cup herbed quinoa

119
 Chapter 9: Presenting Foolproof Healthy-Eating Strategies
5 spears grilled asparagus
Side salad (2 cups mixed greens, 1 tablespoon lowfat vinaigrette dressing)
In this example,
	
✓	Chicken counts as a serving of protein.
	
✓	Herbed quinoa is a serving of low-glycemic grains.
	
✓	Asparagus and salad form three servings of low-glycemic vegetables 
(asparagus = 1 serving, salad = 2 servings).
	
✓	Vinaigrette dressing and the oil for cooking the quinoa count as two fat 
servings.
This meal has an estimated glycemic load of 13 and an estimated 465 calo­
ries. Notice how this meal ups the ante on vegetables? If you ever feel like 
you aren’t getting enough to eat, the trick is to have two different vegetables. 
You can eat a lot more food for a lower glycemic load and calorie level by 
simply upping your veggie intake.
Finding Moderation with Medium- and 
High-Glycemic Foods
Moderation is one of those important secrets to long-term weight loss, even 
when you’re following a low-glycemic diet. Eating only low-glycemic and low-
calorie foods in just the right balance is easy to do for two weeks or even a 
month, but it’s pretty darn hard to do 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I cer­
tainly can’t, and I’ve yet to meet anyone who can. There will always be times 
when you won’t have the best choices in front of you or when you’re just 
craving a specific food.
Trying to be perfect with a diet typically backfires. People who do that often 
fall off the plan and go back to their old habits. I call this an all-or-nothing 
approach because you’re either onboard with said diet or you completely 
stop and say you’ll start up again at a later date. This all-or-nothing approach 
is the difference between following a temporary diet and making long-term 
lifestyle changes. Following a low-glycemic diet is a lifestyle change, which 
means you make the best choices but still leave yourself some wiggle room 
for fun.
If you’re a perfectionist, accepting the concept that you don’t have to per­
fectly follow a low-glycemic diet 100 percent of the time may be challenging. 
Just remember that moderation really is the best way to maintain weight loss 
long term. In the next sections, I explain how to use moderation with a low-
glycemic diet and how to balance your glycemic load throughout the day.

120
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Defining moderation
People in the diet industry tend to throw the term moderation around as if it 
has some concrete definition that everyone knows. But what I’ve learned as 
a registered dietitian is that people have different perceptions, or definitions, 
of moderation. For one person, moderation may mean having a high-glycemic 
item once a week. Another may say once a day, and yet another may consider 
it okay to have one a few times a day.
Here’s a real-life example of just how confusing the concept of modera­
tion can be: I once had a client who ate eight to ten Hershey miniature bars 
throughout each day, basically having a few after each meal. She considered 
this moderation as opposed to sitting down and eating more in one sitting. 
However, her “moderate” snacking still added up to way too many calories, 
sugar, and fat. This wasn’t her fault. It was just her perception of moderation 
because no one had ever defined the term for her.
	
Having some guidelines around moderation will help you stay on track. (It 
also gives you some wiggle room for when you really want that jasmine rice 
with your stir-fry or you want to indulge in some chocolate cake at a birthday 
party.) Following are some quick guidelines to define moderation more clearly 
and make your weight-loss process much easier:
	
✓	Eat medium-glycemic foods once or twice a day, or less.
	
✓	Eat high-glycemic foods two or three times a week, or less.
Balancing your glycemic load for the day
Striving to balance your glycemic load for the day is another way to follow a 
low-glycemic diet in moderation. The idea is to always make the best choices.
	
Try one or more of the following suggestions to help you control your calorie 
level and balance higher-glycemic foods throughout the day:
	
✓	Avoid eating multiple high-glycemic foods in one meal. If you’re going 
to indulge, do it with one food item at that particular meal and make 
sure the rest of your foods are low-glycemic. For instance, if you choose 
to have spaghetti, don’t eat a bunch of garlic bread with it.
	
✓	Consume smaller portions of high-glycemic foods. Remember, portion 
size matters with glycemic load (as explained in Chapter 4). Eating less 
decreases your glycemic load a bit for that meal. Even switching from, 
say, 1 cup of rice to 2⁄3 of a cup makes a difference in a particular meal’s 
glycemic load.

121
 Chapter 9: Presenting Foolproof Healthy-Eating Strategies
	
✓	Avoid eating both high- and medium-glycemic foods in one day. 
Choose one or the other if you can and make the rest of your choices 
low-glycemic. For instance, if after lunch you have a slice of the special 
pumpkin pie (a high-glycemic food) that your coworker brought in, skip 
the macaroni and cheese (a medium-glycemic food) with the kids at 
dinner.
	
✓	Split the portion size of two high-glycemic foods. If you’re out to eat or 
at a party and you see two foods you love that are high-glycemic, eat a 
half portion of each to enjoy your favorites while still keeping your gly­
cemic load down. For instance, maybe you spy potato salad and choco­
late cake at the company picnic. You can have your cake (and potato 
salad too!) if you eat a small slice of it and 1⁄3 cup of the potato salad. 
This compromise is better than consuming a cup of potato salad and a 
large piece of cake.
	
An all-or-nothing approach will almost always keep you stuck in weight-gain/
weight-loss cycles. Ditch that approach and find a balance instead. On a low-
glycemic diet, you can and should allow yourself to indulge without feeling 
guilty, but you shouldn’t abandon your low-glycemic lifestyle for weeks at a 
time. When you indulge, make sure it’s a conscious decision that you know 
works within your guidelines. After all, who doesn’t want to have cake on his 
birthday or potato salad at a barbeque?

Navigating the Grocery Store
In This Chapter
▶	Boosting your low-glycemic grocery shopping know-how
▶	Deciphering nutrition labels
▶	Staying on track with your weight-loss goals by keeping convenience foods on hand
A
 low-glycemic diet isn’t always black and white — a fact that’s appar­
ent the moment you set foot in a grocery store. Rarely will you find the 
words low-glycemic on product packaging. You can certainly go for healthy, 
high-fiber foods, but they may not always be low-glycemic.
Wandering through the grocery store without some preparation will leave you 
in a fog of questions. Was it oats that were low-glycemic or wheat? Do crackers 
count like bread? How do I figure out this box of macaroni and cheese? Should 
I pay attention to calories? With a little planning, though, you can make grocery 
shopping for low-glycemic foods much easier on yourself — and save your 
valuable time and money in the process.
In this chapter, I help you figure out how to navigate the aisles to find your 
best low-glycemic choices, how to cull glycemic information from food labels, 
and how to stock a healthy, low-glycemic kitchen. Grocery shopping will be a 
breeze from now on!
Being a Savvy Low-Glycemic Shopper
Shopping for groceries when you follow a low-glycemic diet is a little differ­
ent from going grocery shopping while on other types of diets. Some foods 
haven’t been tested for their glycemic index, leaving you to make your best 
judgment call while shopping. Knowing what you’re going to buy before you 
enter the grocery store and how to find the best products once you’re there 
are the keys to having a good grocery shopping experience when you’re on 
the hunt for low-glycemic foods. The information in the following sections 
combined with a little preplanning will go a long way toward saving you from 
grocery shopping–induced headaches.

124
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Planning meals to create your grocery list
A grocery list is the golden ticket to a relaxed grocery store trip that saves 
you time and money and keeps you from buying those oh-so-tempting cook­
ies and chips. Using a grocery list helps you focus on buying low-glycemic 
foods and decreases impulse buys that may sabotage your weight-loss 
efforts.
	
You come up with a solid low-glycemic grocery list by planning out your meals 
for the week. Without a meal plan, you can end up buying foods you don’t eat, 
having the wrong foods in the house, or purchasing something just because it 
sounds good in the moment.
For years I regularly went to the grocery store without a plan and picked 
up either foods that sounded good or items I thought I might use. Time and 
again I wound up with a half-eaten roast chicken and spoiled broccoli and 
spinach. I’d then make two or three more trips to the store during the week 
to pick up items I didn’t have when I decided to make a certain recipe for 
dinner. This weekly routine cost me time and money, but it also convinced 
me that having a plan of what you need for breakfasts, lunches, and dinners 
(complete with all the ingredients you need for any special recipes) helps 
you stay on track with dietary guidelines.
	
Making a low-glycemic grocery list and planning your meals each week may 
sound like a daunting task, but it gets easier each time because you ultimately 
have a running list of the foods you use on a regular basis.
When making your first low-glycemic grocery list, your goal is to determine 
those items that you buy regularly (your staples). Then you can simply add 
other ingredients to that list each week. Here are some steps to get you 
started:
	
1.	Figure out your staples.
	
	 Following are some common staples based on where you should keep 
them in your kitchen:
 
• Pantry: Old-fashioned or steel-cut oats, hearty stone-ground 
whole-wheat breads, low-glycemic cereals, pearl barley, bulgur, 
canned veggies (watch the sodium!), canned or dried beans, pasta, 
quinoa, nuts (especially walnuts and almonds), seeds, herbs, 
spices, vinegar, and oil
 
• Refrigerator: Eggs (especially those enriched with omega-3s), 
fish, lean meats, lowfat cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, lowfat plain 
yogurt, fruits, and veggies
 
• Freezer: Frozen berries and veggies
	
	 In addition to these common staples, select foods from the lists in 
Appendix A that sound good to you and that best meet the low-glycemic 

125
 Chapter 10: Navigating the Grocery Store
criteria. (Note: Don’t feel bad if you have to keep referring back to 
Appendix A during your first several weeks of meal planning. It takes 
a while to remember which foods are low-glycemic and which ones 
aren’t.)
	
2.	Purchase a small notebook (something that fits in your pocket or 
purse) and fill in your staples on the left-hand side of several pages.
	
	 You’ll refer to your list of staples each week, so using a small notebook 
and filling in several pages at once helps ensure your grocery list is 
always on hand. Of course, you may find that you don’t need to stock up 
on all of your staples each week, but your list still gives you a quick out­
line to determine what you have on hand and what you need to get.
	
3.	Determine any nonbasic recipes you plan to make and add any extra 
ingredients for that week on the right-hand side of a page.
	
	 Although your list of staples will remain constant from week to week, 
the rest of your grocery list will vary depending on any special recipes 
and meals you’re preparing.
Now that you’ve chosen your meals for the week and prepared your low-
glycemic grocery list, you don’t need to wander the aisles wondering what to 
make this week or trying to remember whether certain foods are low-glycemic. 
You may even be surprised at how much money you save by focusing on 
your list and ignoring impulse-based items.
Knowing the best aisles to visit
When you’re armed with a grocery list and stick to the right aisles, you can 
make your grocery shopping trips efficient and avoid any weight-loss sabo­
teurs along the way. Studies show that people have a tendency to buy impul­
sively — a fact that grocery stores count on when they position tempting 
food items in your line of sight and offer samples of various foods. Before you 
know it, you’re walking out of the grocery store with goodies that aren’t on 
your list and that may end up creating obstacles to your weight-loss efforts.
	
Use the following strategies to help you stay on track and avoid what I like to 
call “grocery store saboteurs”:
	
✓	Don’t go grocery shopping when you’re hungry. Head to the store after 
enjoying a satisfying low-glycemic meal. That way you won’t be tempted 
to go for the quick (usually high-glycemic) convenience foods because 
you’re starving and can’t wait to crack ’em open when you get home.
	
✓	Shop the perimeter. The outside edge of a grocery store is typically the 
best place to find your fresh, healthy food items (think produce, dairy, 
meat, and seafood). Guess what. These are also the most straightforward 
categories for low-glycemic shopping, which means you can buy low-
glycemic fruits, vegetables, and dairy products with ease.

Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
✓	Beware of the beginning section of each aisle. When you walk into a 
store, your line of sight is straight in front of you, which is precisely 
where the store typically puts yummy-looking treats, cereals, and other 
promotional products. Getting sucked in by colorful pictures boasting 
2-for-1 specials is a double whammy that’s awfully hard to resist. So why 
even put yourself in temptation’s way?
	
✓	Do hit the interior aisles that contain canned meats, vegetables, and 
fruit. These items are often spread out between two aisles. Visit these 
aisles for staples such as tuna and soups, as well as ingredients for any 
special recipes you picked out when you prepared your grocery list. 
As long as you’re armed with your grocery list, you can navigate these 
aisles safely (minus the ends, of course).
	
✓	Skip interior aisles that don’t have anything on your list. Do you have 
a habit of going up and down every single aisle when you’re at the gro­
cery store? If so, then you’ve probably realized how easy it is to, say, 
be seduced by the pictures of brownies and cakes on the packages in 
the baking aisle and promise yourself you’ll only eat a few as you throw 
some brownie mix into your cart. Forgo these temptations, stick to your 
list, and only go down the aisles whose products you actually need. 
(Here’s a bonus for you: This strategy saves you some time and money 
too!)
	
✓	Know what breads to look for before heading into that aisle. Even 
though bread products are a staple in many households, the bread aisle 
can be a tricky one to navigate. Make sure you know what types of bread 
are the best low-glycemic choices and try to avoid the tempting muffins 
and donuts hanging out in this aisle.
	
✓	Know which pasta and rice choices are safe before shopping that aisle. 
Pastas and rice can be quite tempting. Improve your chances of making 
low-glycemic choices by knowing which types of pasta and rice are safe 
ahead of time.
	
✓	Tread carefully in the frozen-food aisles. You can find a lot of great items 
(such as meats, veggies, and fruits) in the frozen-food section. You can 
even find some not-so-bad for you treats (think frozen yogurt). However, 
the frozen-food aisles are also riddled with countless other foods that may 
challenge your commitment to your low-glycemic lifestyle. Because a low-
glycemic diet encourages moderation and balance, you shouldn’t feel like 
you can’t walk past the frozen pizzas and ice cream. But you should skip 
any items that aren’t specifically on your list.
	
If you forget which aisles to aim for and which to steer clear of, just remember 
this: Stick to your grocery list.

 Chapter 10: Navigating the Grocery Store
Keeping an eye out for official seals
Early adopters of the low-glycemic diet had to 
engage in a little more guesswork when choos­
ing packaged foods such as breads, crackers, 
and pastas at the grocery store. Granted, you 
still need to examine packaging to make the 
best judgment call, but thanks to some new 
labeling laws, this process is going to become 
easier over time.
The Glycemic Research Institute (GRI) — a 
private, internationally accredited certifying 
agency hired to provide certifications that are 
backed with research — operates a federally 
approved certification program. Food items that 
meet all the certification criteria, including clini­
cal studies, are guaranteed to be low-glycemic. 
They can therefore use the GRI’s low-glycemic 
labels on their packaging in the United States, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom. These labels 
simplify the process of choosing packaged low-
glycemic foods at the grocery store.
The GRI’s Low Glycemic seal appears on those 
products that have been clinically proven to 
have a low glycemic index and load when fed 
to individuals without diabetes. Look for the 
following seal on products such as Uncle Sam 
Cereal and Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted 100% Whole 
Grain Bread.
The Low Glycemic for Diabetics seal (see the 
following figure) denotes products that have 
been shown in clinical studies to have a low 
glycemic index and load in Type 2 diabetics. 
(The GRI hasn’t done any testing to determine 
which foods are friendly for people with Type 
1 diabetes.)
These labels help take the guesswork out of 
grocery shopping so you can rest assured that 
the specific food product you’re buying has 
been clinically tested. However, as you venture 
into your local grocery store, you may not see 
these labels being widely used. That’s because 
the various food manufacturers can decide 
whether or not to have their products tested. 
As more people become familiar with the health 
benefits of a low-glycemic diet, it’s quite likely 
that more manufacturers will apply for one of 
the GRI’s certifications. (Visit the Glycemic 
Research Institute at www.glycemic.com 
for a list of products that are currently using 
these seals.)

128
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Comparing fresh, frozen, 
and canned produce
Small differences can occur in the glycemic level and nutrient value of food 
(especially produce) depending on how it’s packaged. These differences 
aren’t always drastic, but they’re good to know about anyway. Here’s what 
you should know about fresh, frozen, and canned produce:
	
✓	Fresh produce is much better at retaining nutrient value; it also has 
a lower glycemic load. The closer your food is to its harvest time, the 
more nutrients it retains, which makes locally grown produce an espe­
cially good option because it hasn’t had to travel from another city, 
state, or country. Always watch for freshness in your fresh fruits and 
vegetables, whether you’re purchasing locally or not.
	
	Bruises and wilting in produce may be the result of improper handling 
or a sign that the food is past its peak (meaning it has fewer nutrients to 
offer you).
	
✓	Frozen produce has a slightly lower amount of retained nutrients and 
a similar glycemic load. These products are frozen immediately after 
being cleaned and processed, which helps them retain more nutrients. 
Frozen produce can be a great economical value during off-seasons. For 
instance, when blueberries are out of season, the price for fresh ones 
can go up to $5 for a small carton and up to $7 for the organic version. 
That’s a bit much to spend. Fortunately, you can find frozen blueberries 
for much less year-round (or you can just purchase blueberries when 
they’re in season and freeze them in freezer-friendly containers for up to 
six months). Just make sure you’re not choosing frozen fruits that have 
sugar added to them.
	
	Frozen fruits and vegetables (and even meats) are great to have on hand 
as a fast and easy way to round out your meals.
	
✓	Canned produce loses some of its nutrients and often has a bit higher 
glycemic load than fresh or frozen produce. For example, raw apricots 
have a glycemic load of 5 whereas canned apricots have a glycemic load 
of 12. Heating during the canning process is part of the explanation for 
this higher number; the other part is that foods, specifically fruits, are 
often canned in light syrup. You’re better off hunting for canned fruits 
that aren’t stored in syrup when you’re trying to follow a low-glycemic 
diet. When it comes to vegetables, especially beans, canned foods are 
great convenience items, and their glycemic load is similar to that of the 
fresh option.

129
 Chapter 10: Navigating the Grocery Store
Checking ripeness
Ripeness affects foods in two ways: It raises their glycemic index and glyce­
mic load while simultaneously reducing the nutrients you can get from them. 
Some foods, such as fruits that are very ripe, have a higher glycemic load 
than their less-ripened counterparts. For instance, a slightly overripe banana 
has a glycemic load of 13, whereas a slightly underripe banana has a glycemic 
load of 11. Both bananas fall into the medium glycemic load level, so eating 
either one will have the same impact on your blood sugar. However, a com­
pletely underripe banana (one that’s mostly green) has a glycemic load of 6. 
That may make it a low-glycemic food, but eating a solid green banana isn’t 
preferable for most folks.
The longer a food sits out, the riper it becomes, leading to lost nutrients. To 
make sure you’re getting the top nutrient value from various foods, try to 
select them at their peak of freshness. Fresh fruits and vegetables not only 
have more nutrients but they also have a lower glycemic load and a good 
taste.
	
Use the following list of popular fruits and vegetables as your freshness guide 
the next time you’re at the grocery store:
	
✓	Apples should be firm and smooth with no bruises or soft spots.
	
✓	Asparagus should be firm and brightly green for nearly the entire length 
of each stalk.
	
✓	Bananas should be yellow with a slight green color. Avoid bananas with 
black freckles or obvious bruising.
	
✓	Broccoli should have a dark green color and be tightly bunched 
together. Avoid broccoli that’s turning yellow.
	
✓	Cantaloupes should have a yellow or golden background color, not a 
green one (green is too underripe for flavor). The stem area is slightly 
soft when the fruit is ripe.
	
✓	Nectarines should have an orange-yellow-red color and feel slightly soft 
but not too soft. Skip ones with major soft spots or bruising.
	
✓	Oranges should be round and uniform in appearance. Pass over any 
with white mold at the ends.
	
✓	Salad greens should be crisp and not overly soft or wilted.
	
✓	Watermelons tend to make a sloshing sound when they’re overripe, so 
give the one you’re looking at a small shake as a test.

130
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Reading Nutrition Facts Labels
Even though you can’t find a food’s glycemic index or load on its packaging, 
the ever-present nutrition facts label is a valuable tool for finding the best 
low-glycemic choices as well as the best foods for weight loss. Knowing what 
to look for on the label can make life easier for you as you navigate the gro­
cery store aisles.
If you aren’t used to reading a nutrition facts label, deciphering that text may 
seem like a daunting task. Never fear. In the sections that follow, I give you 
the information you need to understand nutrition facts labels and cover how 
to determine whether the foods you’re looking at are low-glycemic.
Examining the nutrition facts label
Following a low-glycemic diet for weight loss means you must look at the 
whole picture of the foods you eat. Determining that a particular food is low-
glycemic is only half of the equation. You also need to make sure that food 
is both healthy and low in calories. The nutrition facts label gives you all the 
info you need to know to make an informed choice. Following are the basics 
on what a standard nutrition facts label in the United States covers, plus a 
few tips to help you find the best products:
	
✓	Portion size: How many portions are in the package. Portion size is one 
of the most important things to look at first because it means the rest of 
the information you find on the label is based on that specific portion 
size. So if the package says there are two servings and the calorie level is 
100, then you’ll end up with 200 calories if you eat the whole package.
	
	The information on a nutrition facts label can be very deceiving if you 
don’t pay attention to portion size. I remember being with my sister 
once when she picked up a couple presumably healthy cookies at the 
health-food store. We got in the car and each gobbled down a cookie 
after only glancing at the label. We both felt unusually full afterward and 
decided to look at the label again. The cookie was 120 calories per serv­
ing, and there were eight servings per cookie!
	
✓	Calories: The amount of energy in one serving. Shoot for lower calorie 
levels when choosing your foods and be willing to compare different 
products to find the perfect one. If you’re looking at entire entrees, 
follow these guidelines:
 
• Women should consume 400 to 500 calories per meal.
 
• Men should consume 500 to 700 calories per meal.
	
	Note: These guidelines are for entire meals only. If your entree is less 
than the top number in the recommended calorie range, that’s okay.

131
 Chapter 10: Navigating the Grocery Store
	
✓	Total fat: One of the three sources of calories for the body. Consuming 
a moderate amount of fats is important for your overall health. A gram 
of fat has more calories than a gram of carbohydrate or protein, causing 
your calorie level to add up quickly whenever you consume fats. Try to 
get no more than 30 percent of your calories from fat per day.
	
	An easy way to determine the amount of fat you’re consuming without 
breaking out the calculator is to look for 3 grams of fat per 100 calories. 
So, for example, a food that has 200 calories should have 6 grams of fat or 
less, and a food that has 300 calories should have 9 grams of fat or less.
	
✓	Saturated fat: A subgroup of total fat that’s considered unhealthy. 
Increased saturated fats in the diet are linked with heart disease and cer­
tain types of cancer. Try to get no more than 10 percent of your daily fat 
intake from saturated fats.
	
	A good rule of thumb is to only consume 1 gram of saturated fats per 100 
calories. So if you’re eating a food that has 200 calories, it should ideally 
have no more than 2 grams of saturated fats.
	
✓	Trans fat: A man-made fat that’s linked with heart disease. Do your best 
to purchase products without trans fats. If they aren’t listed on the label, 
go to the ingredients list and look for the terms hydrogenated oil or par­
tially hydrogenated oil; these terms are another way of saying a food has 
trans fats.
	
	You may notice that the label says 0 trans fats, yet you still see hydro­
genated oils listed among the ingredients. That means the food is made 
with trans fats, but for that portion size the amount of trans fats adds up 
to less than 0.5 grams. If you use more than the listed portion size, that 
minimal amount of trans fats will add up.
	
✓	Fiber: The indigestible portion of a plant that provides roughage. The 
more the better! Fiber helps control your blood sugar and helps you 
feel full for a longer period of time. It provides denseness to foods, has 
no calories, and can be found in fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, and 
foods made with grains such as cereal, pasta, bread, and rice. Shoot for 
3 grams of fiber or more per serving.
	
✓	Sodium: A flavor-enhancing preservative. Sodium can cause your body 
to retain fluid, making you feel heavy and bloated. Scientific research 
shows that it may even stimulate your appetite. Avoid these negative 
effects by going easy on the salt shaker, choosing lower-sodium items, 
and limiting your sodium intake to 240 milligrams per serving.
	
	Staying at or below 240 milligrams of sodium per serving tends to be 
difficult when you’re dealing with packaged and canned foods because 
they often use sodium as a preservative. Do the best you can by finding 
the lowest sodium content available.

132
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Using the ingredients list
Although nutrition facts labels include data on total carbohydrates and sugars, 
that doesn’t give you much to go on as far as glycemic load. To determine 
that, you really need to know what the food is made up of. For instance, if you 
find whole-grain bread, you need to know what grain was used to make it — 
wheat, oats, or millet. Wheat and oats are fairly low-glycemic, but millet can be 
medium- to high-glycemic. Fortunately a food’s ingredients list can give you a 
good idea whether you’re buying a product that uses low-glycemic foods.
You can typically find the ingredients list at the bottom of the nutrition facts 
label, like in Figure 10-1. (However, you may find it in a different spot on the 
package depending on the available space.) Ingredients are listed from high­
est content to lowest. So the first ingredient makes up most of that food, and 
the last ingredient makes up the least amount.

Unless a product is tested for its glycemic index, you can only make your best-
educated choice about it. If you know, for example, that most tested whole-
wheat breads are low-glycemic, then you can get an idea for other products 
made of the same ingredients.
Stocking Up for Success
One of the best strategies you can put into place to keep yourself from aban­
doning all of your new dietary changes is to keep your pantry stocked. This 
advice may sound simplistic, but it’s truly one of the most useful strategies 
for staying on track. Why? Well, if you haven’t already, you’ll eventually reach 
a point where life gets messy or busy and you just don’t have time to plan 
and prepare healthy meals.
Thinking that every day of the week will go as planned just isn’t realistic. 
Sure, you know that on Monday you’re going to make chicken cacciatore for 
dinner and on Tuesday you’re going to make stir-fry. What happens when on 
Monday your boss wants you to finish up a project at home or you just don’t 
make it to the grocery store? All of your good intentions can easily fall apart 
right then and there when you revert to your old habits or simply grab some 
fast food or take-out. Although this is okay to do once in a while, the reality is 
these types of little weekday interferences occur all the time. Life just never 
seems to run as smoothly as you want it to, and that’s one of the biggest chal­
lenges I see people encounter when making diet and lifestyle changes.
What about mixed foods?
Looking at the ingredients list for bread and 
pasta is one thing, but what on earth do you 
do with an entire entree that uses many differ­
ent foods (think lasagna or a frozen dinner)? 
Well, unless these items have been tested, 
you must make your best-educated choice 
by looking at the glycemic load of the indi­
vidual ingredients. Of course, the glycemic 
load of foods can change when the foods are 
combined together. Fortunately there’s no need 
to get too hung up on the small details because 
using low-glycemic foods in moderation is 
shown to provide benefits to blood sugar levels 
and heart health. So just take your best guess 
when it comes to mixed foods and stock up on 
the foods you know to be low-glycemic (like 
most fruits and veggies).

134
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
	
To truly integrate a low-glycemic diet into your lifestyle, you need to be pre­
pared. Keeping some healthy convenience foods on hand at all times is the 
key. I’m sure you’ve had one of those days where you’re running late or you’re 
just not in the mood to cook. If you always have some backup foods on hand, 
you can throw together something quick and healthy — meaning you don’t 
have to abandon your new low-glycemic eating habits just because life got in 
the way of your plan.
	
Stocking up on staples when they’re on sale or when you have coupons can 
actually help you slash your food budget.
In the following sections, I share some pantry, freezer, and refrigerator favor­
ites so you know what to stock up on in order to make fast and easy throw-
together meals.
Pantry basics
Following is a list of great items to always have on hand in your pantry (feel 
free to swap in your own low-glycemic favorites):
	
✓	Soups
	
✓	Chili
	
✓	Grains (quinoa, pearl barley, or brown rice)
	
✓	Bread (note that this is a perishable item)
	
✓	Low-glycemic cereals
	
✓	Oatmeal
	
✓	Polenta mix
	
✓	Canned beans
	
✓	Canned vegetables
	
✓	Canned fruits packed in water (with no added sugars)
	
✓	Tuna fish or packaged salmon
	
When stocking up your pantry, always choose low-glycemic items that have a 
long shelf life.
Freezer-friendly favorites
The beauty of the freezer is that it allows you to use produce in an afford­
able and convenient way so you don’t need to abandon fruits and vegetables 

135
 Chapter 10: Navigating the Grocery Store
when you’re short on time. The following items are great to keep in your 
freezer on a regular basis:
	
✓	Frozen vegetables (all kinds except for potatoes such as French fries)
	
✓	Frozen fruits (with no added sugars)
	
✓	Bag of skinless, boneless chicken breasts
	
✓	Frozen salmon burgers
	
✓	Whole-wheat hamburger buns
	
You can also add your own cooked freezer favorites to have handy when you 
need them. Some ideas include
	
✓	Homemade soups, stews, and chilis
	
✓	Cooked brown rice, quinoa, or pearl barley (portion in individual serving 
bags so you can pull one out for a quick meal)
	
✓	Grilled chicken
Weekly refrigerator staples
Refrigerator staples are more perishable, so pick foods you know you’ll 
use to avoid wasting anything. Don’t get discouraged if it takes some time 
to figure out what your refrigerator standbys should be. That’s completely 
normal.
	
You may have a much longer list of refrigerator staples than the following one 
when you do your meal planning. These items are just meant to be around for 
quick meals when you need them:
	
✓	Cheese
	
✓	Yogurt
	
✓	Milk
	
✓	Eggs
	
✓	Deli meats
	
✓	Salad dressing
	
✓	Favorite grilling sauces
	
✓	Prewashed bags of salad greens or fresh spinach
	
✓	Favorite low-glycemic fruits

136
Part II: Switching to a Low-Glycemic Diet 
Using stocked staples to make quick-and-easy meals
The whole goal of having low-glycemic foods 
on hand is to use them to create on-the-fly 
meals. Doing so helps decrease your need to 
eat in restaurants and saves you calories and 
money. Ultimately, that means you can reach 
your weight-loss goals successfully over time.
Some meals can be thrown together in minutes, 
whereas others may take a little more time to 
prepare. The deciding factor in how to use your 
low-glycemic staples is how much time you 
have. You can be as creative as you want with 
this process, but here are a few ideas to get you 
started:
	✓	Mixed greens with salmon: This is an ultra-
fast meal to put together. Simply grab your 
mixed greens and any fresh veggies you 
have on hand and mix with your prepack­
aged salmon, kidney beans or chickpeas, 
and your favorite salad dressing.
	✓	Chili or soup and salad: Another quick meal 
is to warm up one of your favorite soups or 
chilis and make a side salad with your pre­
packaged greens. This is a light meal, so 
you can pack your salad high with veggies, 
beans, or even nuts.
	✓	Rice, beans, and vegetables: Even though 
rice is typically a higher-glycemic food, 
brown rice tends to have a low- or medium-
glycemic load. Cook some brown rice or 
use some that you’ve already cooked and 
frozen, add some black beans plus any veg­
gies you have on hand, and top with some 
cheese. Warm it all up in the microwave 
until your cheese melts. Note: To save on 
calories, don’t overdo the cheese. A quar­
ter cup is plenty.
	✓	Grilled chicken breasts with vegetables 
and quinoa: Take your frozen chicken 
breasts, top with your favorite grilling 
sauce, and grill until cooked through. 
Cook up some quinoa or use some that 
you already had frozen and warm up some 
frozen veggies in the microwave. This is a 
complete meal that you can make any time 
as long as you have these staples around. 
(Remember: Always cook frozen chicken 
breasts in one of three ways: in the oven, 
on the stove, or on the grill. Don’t cook 
frozen chicken in the microwave because 
the meat won’t cook evenly.)
	✓	Salmon burgers with steamed vegetables: 
Thaw out a hamburger bun and cook your 
frozen salmon burger in a pan. Add any top­
pings you enjoy and warm up some frozen 
veggies for a side.
	✓	Sandwiches: If you really don’t want to 
cook (or even think about it!), you can 
always have a sandwich for lunch or 
dinner. Whether you make up tuna fish or 
basic turkey, sandwiches are always an 
easy fix that you can eat with soup, salad, 
or fruit.
	✓	Veggie omelet (or scramble): Mix your eggs 
and a little milk, pour into a pan, add some 
thawed vegetables, and top with cheese.
	✓	Oatmeal and berries: Cook up your oats on 
the stove or in the microwave. Thaw some 
frozen blueberries in the microwave for 30 
seconds and add ’em to the cereal. Pour in 
some milk, and you’re ready to go! If you 
want a bigger breakfast, eat a yogurt or 
poached egg with your oatmeal.

oes it ever seem that life gets in the way of losing 
weight? A relative has a birthday, complete with a 
celebration dinner and, of course, birthday cake and ice 
cream. The kids have sports practice at dinnertime so you 
zip through the fast food drive-through. You go on vacation, 
to a restaurant, or to a friend’s home for dinner. Here’s 
the good news: You can continue to enjoy all of these 
activities without putting your weight-loss goals on hold 
by using the tips and strategies featured in these four 
chapters.
Another part of a successful, long-term weight-loss strat­
egy is planning ahead for potential obstacles such as food 
cravings and the dreaded weight-loss plateau. In the fol­
lowing chapters, I show you how to eat mindfully and 
explore new ways of dealing with emotions that don’t 
involve food. And because a solid support system is a cru­
cial component of losing weight and keeping it off, I also 
show you that you can find support in a variety of forms, 
including friends and family, local groups, and even the 
Internet.

Guidelines for Dining Out
In This Chapter
▶	Figuring out how to make smart, healthy food choices in any restaurant
▶	Recognizing traits of restaurants with a wealth of low-glycemic options
▶	Recommending the best low-glycemic meal choices in a variety of cuisine types
D
ining out used to be a once-in-a-while occasion to meet up with friends 
and family to enjoy the ambience of a nice restaurant, some good 
company, and a wonderful meal. Now people are eating out more than ever 
before, making it more difficult to make healthy choices because you have 
less control over what’s on your plate.
At home, you know exactly what you’re putting into a recipe and can even 
measure how much you’re putting on your plate. But in restaurants, you’re 
really just taking your best guess because a) you can’t be sure how much 
of a particular food item is being added and b) the dish is served on a plate 
the size of a trough. Although I can easily tell you that avoiding eating out 
as much as you can is wise, I know that doing so may not be very practical. 
That’s why having some good strategies in place is key.
The beauty of a low-glycemic diet is that it isn’t an all-or-nothing diet. It 
allows some flexibility for you to eat higher-glycemic foods in moderation. 
In fact, research shows that using low-glycemic foods in moderation, even 
just one low-glycemic food choice a meal, still provides you with the benefits 
you’re looking for, making it easier to adopt low-glycemic foods into your 
lifestyle. This type of moderation is also the best way to get long-term results 
with weight loss. (Being too strict always backfires.) In this chapter, I show 
you how to make smart choices while dining out and present a variety of 
good lower-glycemic meal options for just about any type of restaurant.
Choosing Wisely
Although it can be tricky, you can eat in restaurants, follow a low-glycemic 
diet, and lose weight. But you have to be willing to make educated choices 
instead of just going with whatever you feel like eating. (Of course, even 

140
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
when you make the best choices, restaurant meals are usually going to be 
much higher in calories than what you’d prepare at home — which can make 
trying to lose weight an uphill battle if you’re eating out all the time.) The fol­
lowing sections present some strategies to help you make the best choices 
when you’re dining out.
	
Becoming more aware of what you’re ordering and how much food is on your 
plate can greatly enhance your ability to make healthier sit-down restaurant 
or fast-food dining choices.
Basing your choices on 
how often you eat out
Some people eat out several times a week; others prefer to dine out just a few 
times a year. These two groups of folks could make the same food choices 
while eating out, but I don’t advise it.
If you find that you eat in restaurants or order some sort of takeout two or 
more times a week, then moderation takes on a new meaning. Indulging a 
little once a month is one thing, but indulging two or more times a week will 
sabotage your weight-loss efforts. No, you don’t have to forgo eating in res­
taurants. That concept is no longer realistic in a society in which Americans 
spend 46 percent of their food dollars on dining out (compared to just 26 
percent in 1970) thanks to fast-paced lifestyles and the convenience of restau­
rants. You do, however, have to change how you think about dining out.
	
For many people, going to a restaurant used to equal a special occasion 
where they could indulge and order whatever they wanted. This response can 
become hardwired into your brain, leading to an increased consumption of 
significantly higher calorie, fat, and sodium levels on a regular basis. It’s sort 
of like the healthy choices you’d make at home get “turned off” at a restaurant 
and you order whatever sounds good without thinking about calories, glyce­
mic level, fat, and so on. You’re simply conditioned to get the item that sounds 
the best versus the item that’s the healthiest choice. If you’re eating in restau­
rants weekly, go ahead and pick a couple special outings each month (perhaps 
a birthday, a party with friends, or an anniversary) as your indulgence meals. 
Just make sure you’re indulging only on those occasions, not each and every 
time you set foot in a restaurant.
	
For those weekly convenience meals, select simple, healthy choices. (I share 
different low-glycemic food choices for a variety of cuisine types later in this 
chapter.)

141
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
Also, consider evaluating how frequently you eat out. Even though you may 
be making healthier selections when you dine out, keep in mind that you 
don’t always know or have control over how the food is prepared. How much 
oil was added to the pan before cooking? How much cheese was used? Did 
they really leave off the butter on your steamed broccoli? Because of these 
unknowns, people still typically consume more calories, fat grams, and 
sodium when they dine out than their bodies really need. Eating at home or 
preparing your own on-the-go meal isn’t always feasible, but making the effort 
by cutting back on how frequently you dine out can do a lot for weight loss.
Requesting low-glycemic substitutions
It’s possible to follow your low-glycemic lifestyle and find choices in restau­
rants by asking for a few (sometimes creative) modifications. Maybe you see 
that the restaurant serves a lower-glycemic brown rice with one dish but a 
higher-glycemic potato with the dish you want. Asking the wait staff whether 
you can make replacements is not only perfectly okay but also a simple way 
to work your way through a menu.
	
Asking for replacements is generally no problem as long as your request 
seems reasonable and you’re approaching it in a friendly manner.
	
For a pleasant low-glycemic substitution experience on your next restaurant 
visit, just keep these tidbits in mind:
	
✓	If you don’t see an item on the menu, the restaurant probably doesn’t 
have it. You can always ask for the item anyway, but don’t expect the 
restaurant to provide you something it doesn’t carry.
	
✓	Some menu options are prepared in advance, meaning they’re already 
mixed together. Again, asking is okay so long as you realize that the res­
taurant may have certain limitations. For instance, it may not be able to 
replace white rice with brown in your chicken gumbo.
	
✓	Being extrafriendly goes a long way. Complimenting the chef and get­
ting to know the servers means they may be more willing to go the extra 
mile for you the next time you come in.
For the most part, making simple substitutions isn’t a big deal. The low-
glycemic diet allows you a lot more flexibility than other diet protocols.

142
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Watching your portion sizes
Restaurant portion sizes are growing and growing and growing. So much so 
that you can’t even recognize normal portion sizes anymore! They look tiny 
compared to what your eyes are used to seeing. A normal portion of pasta 
is 1⁄2 cup, or enough pasta to fit in the palm of your hand (a small-sized hand, 
that is). Seeing this size portion served in a restaurant would seem almost 
shocking. Even bagels have grown in size over the last 20 years. A regular ol’ 
3-inch bagel has about 150 calories, but modern jumbo bagels measure about 
41⁄2 inches across for a total of 300 to 400 calories.
Portion sizes in today’s restaurants have become almost comical. Case in 
point: I recently went out to eat with a group of friends. One of the men with us 
ordered a plate of ribs. When it came to the table, all eight of us looked at it in 
astonishment and then began laughing. The server had brought out an entire 
half of a cow’s rib cage in a trough. It looked like something you’d see on The 
Flintstones. This particular meal was big enough to serve all eight of us!
Tricks o’ the trade: Calling ahead and making friends
You’ve probably asked for simple substitutions 
with your restaurant meals in the past, but how 
far can you go? If you have a friendly rather 
than demanding approach, a restaurant’s staff 
is often willing to go the extra mile for you. One 
of my good friends follows a fairly low-glycemic 
diet; she also has many food intolerances and 
allergies. I’ve seen firsthand (in amazement, I 
might add) the creative and wonderful foods 
that she gets when we go out to eat. Her trick? 
She calls ahead to talk to the manager or chef 
about the menu options.
She starts the conversation by letting the man­
ager or chef know all the wonderful things 
she’s heard about his restaurant and how she’s 
looking forward to trying it out. Then she lets 
him know that she has some diet limitations 
and asks whether there’s anything he can do 
for her. Most of the time the manager or chef 
comes up with a variation of a menu item that 
works for her. Sometimes she even receives 
something completely special — almost like 
a challenge for the chef. My friend lets the 
restaurant staff know the time and date she’ll 
be dining there and then wow! I’ve seen her 
receive amazing entrees that the chefs cook up 
special just for her.
You’re welcome to try this tactic, which is espe­
cially handy if you live in a small area with a 
limited number of restaurants. I can’t guaran­
tee every restaurant manager and chef will be 
receptive, but more often than not, you’ll find 
some winners. If the manager or chef does 
make an exception for you, do like my friend 
does and always make sure to thank him, either 
in person or through your server.

143
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
	
The average restaurant portion size is large enough to feed three adults. 
Furthermore, studies have found a direct association between eating out, 
higher caloric intakes, and higher body weights. (These are important facts to 
know because obesity rates have doubled in the past 20 years.) Although get­
ting a lot of food for your money is great, science tells us that the more you 
see, the more you eat (and consequently the more you’ll eventually see on 
your thighs!).
	
Here are some tips to keep your restaurant portion sizes at bay so you can 
have better control over your calorie intake and glycemic load:
	
✓	Don’t clean your plate. Your mom may have made you practice this 
tactic growing up, but routinely cleaning your plate in restaurants will 
inevitably lead you to gain weight rather than lose it.
	
✓	Eat half or even a quarter of the regular entree or split the meal with 
a friend. You can eat the smaller amount and take the rest home for 
another meal. And if you’re dining alone, ask for a to-go box at the begin­
ning of your meal. Then you won’t be tempted to eat more than you 
intended.
	
✓	Stay hydrated. Many times people feel overly hungry because they’re 
dehydrated. Try drinking a couple glasses of water while you wait for 
your meal to help you avoid overeating.
	
✓	Opt for a half deli sandwich with vegetable soup or a side salad rather 
than a burger and fries at lunch. You can find these items in your local 
deli or supermarket, as well as at most sit-down restaurants.
	
✓	Choose an appetizer and side salad as your main meal. The size of 
today’s appetizers represents a more accurate portion size. Combining 
an appetizer with a side salad can make a satisfying meal.
	
✓	Avoid specialty breads. Choose whole-wheat bread over focaccia, 
baguettes, rolls, or other specialty breads. Whole-wheat bread has a 
lower glycemic load and a lower calorie level than many of the specialty 
breads out there.
	
✓	Get your salad dressings, sauces, mayonnaise, and gravies on the side. 
Doing so puts you in charge of the amount used, which makes for better 
calorie control.
	
✓	Skip the extra cheese on anything you order. If you can live without 
the extra cheese, you can save yourself more than 100 calories.
	
✓	Avoid bread and chip baskets that come to your table before your 
meal begins. Can’t resist? Tell your server to skip bringing the basket to 
your table altogether.

144
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Steer clear of burritos. They’re often very large, plus many restaurants 
use a sticky white rice that has a very high glycemic index. (Not to men­
tion they give you way more than the ideal 1⁄3-cup portion.)
	
✓	Choose lean meats. These include chicken, turkey, and fish. Eating a 
turkey sandwich in place of a roast beef sandwich can save you 100 calo­
ries and 10 grams of saturated fat.
	
✓	Hit the salad bar. Doing so allows you to build up a healthy salad with 
vegetables, beans, and lean meats while avoiding any high-glycemic 
foods.
	
✓	Go easy on stuffed entrees. It’s hard to know whether the stuffing has a 
higher glycemic load. Plus stuffed entrees, such as casseroles, are often 
loaded in fat and calories. One exception is tortellini and other stuffed 
pastas. These are typically lower-glycemic (unless of course you load 
them up with a heavy cream sauce).
	
✓	Avoid “supersizing” combo meals. Supersized meals may be an eco­
nomic value, but they can add up to 2,000 calories for just one meal. 
That’s more calories than most people should eat in an entire day.
	
✓	Skip fried foods. They just add unnecessary calories and fat.
	
✓	Go for grilled vegetables, fruit, or salads as a side. Doing so can help 
you save calories, lower your glycemic load, add important nutrients, 
and help you feel fuller for a longer period of time.
	
✓	Share one dessert. Splurging is fine, but most restaurant desserts are 
also as large as the entrees. Sharing a dessert is a good way to have your 
cake and not feel guilty about eating it too.
Is your favorite coffee drink making you gain weight?
Many people frequent coffee shops more than 
they do restaurants. Coffee in general is a low-
glycemic item, which is good. Even when you 
add milk you’re still in pretty decent shape. 
However, after you add all the others bells and 
whistles to your coffee, that once-low glyce­
mic load increases — along with the amount 
of calories.
If you’ve ever wondered how many calories and 
sugar grams are in your favorite coffee drinks, 
then the following list can give you an idea. Oh, 
and just for reference, consuming 250 extra 
calories per day will lead to a 1⁄2-pound weight 
increase each week, or about a 24-pound 
weight increase in a year.
Regular coffee drinks:
	✓	Medium brewed coffee: 10 calories, no 
sugar
	✓	Medium Caffè Americano: 15 calories, no 
sugar
Gourmet coffee drinks:
	✓	Medium Caffè Latte: 260 calories, 19 grams 
sugar (5 teaspoons)
	✓	Medium Caffè Mocha: 400 calories, 33 
grams sugar (8 teaspoons)

145
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
Picking Low-Glycemic-Friendly 
Restaurants
	
Eating out when you want to lose weight frequently means you need to pay a 
little more attention to the restaurants you’re choosing, which in turn means 
you should know a little something about what a low-glycemic-friendly restau­
rant looks like. Such establishments tend to
	
✓	Offer a wide variety of menu options
	
✓	Feature multiple choices for breads, rice, and pastas (rye, whole-wheat, 
brown, and so on)
	
✓	Have menu items that contain low-glycemic food choices, such as veg­
etables, beans, and whole-wheat bread
	
✓	Serve side vegetables or salad entrees
On the flip side, some restaurants may leave you hard-pressed to find much 
of anything that’s low-glycemic. Restaurants that aren’t so low-glycemic-
friendly generally have these characteristics:
	
✓	A very limited menu
	
✓	A lack of vegetable choices (think sides, soups, or salads)
	✓	Medium Caramel Apple Cider: 410 calories, 
68 grams sugar (17 teaspoons)
	✓	Medium Caramel Macchiato: 310 calories, 
34 grams sugar (9 teaspoons)
	✓	Medium Chai Tea Latte: 240 calories, 41 
grams sugar (10 teaspoons)
	✓	Medium Hot Chocolate: 350 calories, 40 
grams sugar (10 teaspoons)
	✓	Medium White Chocolate Mocha: 510 calo­
ries, 55 grams sugar (14 teaspoons)
Gourmet coffee drinks are good, but as you can 
see, many of the popular ones are equivalent 
to eating a dessert. (A couple also exceed the 
daily recommended sugar consumption of 12 
teaspoons or less.) If you’re trying to manage 
your weight, keep the gourmet coffee drinks to 
a once-in-a-while treat rather than an everyday 
habit. But if you must feed your gourmet coffee 
addiction, consider these alternatives and tips, 
which will decrease the calorie, sugar, and/or 
fat counts of your favorite coffee beverage:
	✓	Order regular brewed coffee or a Caffè 
Americano (hot or iced).
	✓	Drink unsweetened iced tea or hot tea 
brewed from tea bags.
	✓	Choose skim milk over regular milk with 
lattes and chai teas.
	✓	Ask for half the syrup or powder in flavored 
lattes and chai teas.
	✓	Skip the whipped cream.

146
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Fries, potato salad, or potato chips as the only side options
	
✓	A lot of pasta, noodle, or rice dishes
	
If you live in a small town with limited restaurant choices, don’t stress about not 
immediately being able to find low-glycemic dishes on the menu. Instead, try 
to make friends with the owner, chef, or wait staff. If you do, the restaurant just 
may be able to accommodate your needs. For example, maybe it has a soup 
of the day that changes frequently. You can send in your request for a low-
glycemic-friendly soup. Asking never hurts so long as you’re friendly about it.
	
When it comes to the glycemic index of foods, you’re really looking at carbo­
hydrates. Think about the different types of restaurants that you can choose 
from. Do they offer whole-wheat or rye bread rather than white? Do they have 
entrees that include lots of veggies as opposed to dishes loaded down with 
starches? Restaurants that don’t offer low-glycemic-friendly foods can make 
selecting the best food choices much more difficult (not to mention your 
body’s response to the meal will be tougher to handle). Make a list of restau­
rants that offer food selections that help maintain your low-glycemic focus. 
Then try to stick to these options.
If you’re going out with friends and family and you aren’t able to select the 
restaurant of your choice, don’t fret. You can still make the best decisions 
with the options you’re given. After all, living a low-glycemic lifestyle isn’t an 
exact science. Just choose foods that have a lower glycemic index and pro­
vide a nice nutrient balance; then monitor your portion sizes.
Presenting the Best Low-Glycemic 
Food Choices for . . .
To make finding low- (or lower-) glycemic dishes at your favorite restaurant — 
be it Italian, Thai, or Mexican — a little easier, I’ve come up with several options 
that are also low in fat and calories. Keep in mind that each restaurant cooks 
foods differently, so you still need to use your best judgment. Note: The recom­
mendations in the following sections are based on using low-glycemic foods; 
these menu items haven’t been officially tested for their glycemic loads.
American restaurants
Most American-style menus offer many choices. You can select an entree 
salad, certain soups, or meat entrees with a side of your choice. The list goes 
on, but here are some good low-glycemic picks:

147
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
	
✓	Entree salads with grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp: Ask for the 
dressing on the side to control your calories and skip the toasted bread 
if the salad comes with it.
	
✓	Turkey or grilled chicken sandwiches on whole-wheat bread or buns: 
Avoid fries or potato chips as your side; they’re a double whammy 
because they’re high in glycemic load as well as calories. Instead, 
choose a side salad, vegetable, or soup.
	
✓	Broiled, baked, or grilled chicken or fish entrees with a side salad 
or vegetable: If the restaurant has starchy sides, ask whether it offers 
brown rice or another lower-glycemic option.
	
✓	Minestrone or vegetable soups: Avoid cream soups or those that have a 
significant amount of noodles or rice.
	
✓	Chicken, shrimp, or beef stir-fry: If you can find a restaurant that car­
ries brown rice, stir-fry can be a great lower-glycemic option.
Chinese restaurants
	
As you can probably guess, finding low-glycemic Chinese food is tough given 
that rice and noodles are a main part of almost every dish. Most of the meals 
in the following list automatically come with fried or white rice, so ask your 
server whether you can have brown rice. If the answer’s no, then eat a small 
amount of the rice or just skip it altogether.
Following are your best bets for lower-glycemic Chinese meals:
	
✓	Egg drop soup: This very basic soup contains primarily broth, spices, 
and eggs. It’s generally very low in calories as well and acts as a good 
starter for your Chinese meal.
	
✓	Tofu with vegetables: Tofu has a relatively low glycemic index. Mix tofu 
with vegetables, and you have a winning combination.
	
✓	Curry tofu or chicken: This simple dish is deep in flavor. Many estab­
lishments make this dish with potatoes, so you can ask for them to be 
left out.
	
✓	Dim sum (chicken or fish with vegetables): Dim sum is always a good 
choice when you want to get some vegetables in your Chinese meal.
	
✓	Barbequed pork with mustard and seeds: This dish makes a great 
starter. You can also combine it with soup and a vegetable to make it 
into a whole meal.
	
✓	Chicken or scallops with vegetables: To keep this meal low-glycemic, 
make sure the meat or seafood isn’t fried.

148
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Stir-fried chicken, shrimp, or tofu with vegetables: Stir-fry dishes are 
simple and delicious. They also offer a variety of foods in one dish, 
making it easy to forgo the rice or eat much less of it.
	
✓	Moo Goo Gai Pan: This simple and light meal combines chicken with 
mushrooms and often other vegetables.
	
✓	Shrimp and snow peas: Another light meal, shrimp and snow peas is 
also a relatively lowfat dish.
Fast-food restaurants
Fast food falls into that category of not-so-low-glycemic-friendly foods. 
However, there are a few choices that you can get by with when you’re out 
and about and need to pick up a quick meal:
	
✓	Salads: I know fast-food salads may not sound that appealing, but their 
quality is continually improving. Many fast-food chains now offer pre­
mium salads, such as Caesar salads and grilled chicken salads, that are 
much more exciting than the small side salads they used to serve.
	
✓	Apple slices: Many fast-food restaurants are now offering apple slices as 
a healthier option for kids’ meals. Well, apple slices are pretty darn good 
for adults too!
	
✓	Sub sandwiches on whole-wheat bread: Whether or not you can get a 
sub sandwich on whole-wheat bread depends entirely on the restaurant, 
but some do offer whole-wheat options. Stick with turkey, chicken, or 
veggie sandwiches to keep your calorie level down.
	
✓	Half a sub sandwich and soup: Many of the sub sandwich shops feature 
a variety of soups. If you really want to keep your calorie level and gly­
cemic load down, pick the smallest sandwich choice (even if it’s a kids’ 
size) and get a side of vegetable or minestrone soup.
	
✓	Soft tacos: This fast-food pick has a lower glycemic load and a lower 
calorie level when prepared with corn or whole-wheat tortillas. (The soft 
flour tortilla shell actually has a higher glycemic load than the crunchy 
corn taco shell.)
Italian restaurants
Selecting low-glycemic dishes from an Italian menu can be tricky because 
most Italian menus feature a lot of pasta dishes, which fall within the medium 
to high glycemic load range. Italian restaurants are obviously known for 

149
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
pasta dishes, but they’re also well-known for tasty seafood and poultry. 
Following are your best low-glycemic picks at an Italian restaurant:
	
✓	Cheese- or meat-stuffed ravioli: Although stuffed ravioli is still a pasta 
dish, the stuffing actually helps lower the pasta’s glycemic load down to 
at least a medium level. This dish is a good choice when you want a little 
pasta.
	
✓	Cheese-stuffed tortellini: Again, the stuffing lowers the glycemic load of 
this pasta dish to a medium level.
	
✓	Chicken cacciatore: This entree often has some sort of pasta served 
with it, but the main focus is on the chicken. Order a side salad with this 
meal and eat less of the pasta.
	
✓	Frittata with vegetables: This egg dish is a very good low-glycemic 
choice. If it’s served on toast or bread, ask for the whole-wheat variety.
	
✓	Minestrone soup: This veggie-and-bean-packed, broth-based soup is 
always a good bet. Some minestrone soups also include pasta in a small 
amount.
	
✓	Cioppino (fish soup): If you think soup is too light for a meal, you 
haven’t tried fish soup. Cioppino is a hearty soup that often contains up 
to ten different types of fish and seafood.
	
✓	Pollo a la Romana (chicken in wine sauce): You may see this item 
listed under different names, but if you want to try it, just look around at 
the poultry dishes. Make sure the wine sauce hasn’t been converted to a 
cream sauce (otherwise you’ll be eating too many calories).
	
✓	Muscolidella Riviera (steamed mussels in red sauce): Italy is known for 
its amazing seafood dishes, one of which is Muscolidella Riviera. This 
is a great example of a main course with a lower-calorie sauce. If it’s 
served with pasta, just eat a smaller amount of the pasta and focus on 
the steamed mussels.
	
✓	Zuppa di Vongole (clams with white wine and shallots): This dish is 
another Italian seafood favorite for many. Yes, you have to really enjoy 
seafood to like Zuppa di Vongole, but mussels and clams can be a great 
low-glycemic menu option.
	
✓	Grilled or baked poultry dishes in white wine or red sauce: You’ll find 
many different choices for poultry depending on the Italian restaurant 
you choose. Just make sure the one you select is light on cheese and 
cream sauces.
	
✓	Grilled or baked fish dishes: Depending on the restaurant, you may find 
some unique Italian fish entrees. These can be a great choice if you stick 
with light sauces.
	
✓	Thin-crust pizza: Feel free to opt for this type of pizza, but remember 
that pizza generally comes with a lot of calories. Have a couple slices 
with a side salad for the perfect balance.

150
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
If you go for a pasta dish at an Italian restaurant, know that even if it’s a lower 
glycemic load choice, most tested measurements are using around a 3⁄4-cup 
portion size — a size that’s much, much smaller than what you’ll be served. 
Recognize this fact and order a side salad so you don’t eat too much pasta.
Building a healthy pizza
Pizza can actually be a low-glycemic meal 
option, but with its white-flour crust, melted 
cheese, and high-fat meats, it can add up in 
calories and fat fast, leaving your weight-loss 
efforts in the dust. Following are some tips for 
making over pizza so it can be a truly beneficial 
part of a low-glycemic diet:
	✓	Choose a lower-fat crust. Thin- or regular-
crust pizzas are a better choice than pan 
pizzas because pan pizzas have more fat 
added to the crust. That extra fat may make 
the crust richer and, well, crusty, but it also 
adds about 80 more calories per slice.
	✓	Avoid cream and oil- or pesto-based 
sauces. Many gourmet pizzas these days 
offer a variety of sauces that can quickly 
add up in calories and fat. Stick with a tra­
ditional tomato sauce to avoid those addi­
tional calories.
	✓	Stick to the small size. Have you ever 
noticed that your pizza slice is a different 
size at different restaurants? This observa­
tion is so important because one slice of 
pizza at your favorite pizza parlor may actu­
ally be two servings. One medium slice of 
pizza should be around 6 inches long. No 
need to break out the ruler, but do be aware 
of how big your slices are.
	✓	Have a side dish. Traditionally, when you eat 
pizza, that’s all you eat for the entire meal, 
which can lead to excess calories thanks to 
large portion sizes. Order a side salad with 
your pizza so you can eat fewer servings of 
pizza and still have a complete meal. Having 
a side salad rather than an extra slice of 
pizza saves you around 100 calories.
	✓	Avoid the high-fat toppings. Pepperoni and 
sausage contribute a significant amount 
of calories and saturated fat to pizza. 
Choosing Canadian bacon, vegetables, or 
just plain cheese is one of the best ways to 
keep your pizza on the healthy side.
	✓	Don’t add extra high-fat toppings. Opting 
for extra meats and cheese (think meat 
lovers’ pizzas or five-cheese pizzas) adds 
anywhere from 50 to 100 extra calories per 
slice.
Here’s an example of a pizza meal makeover so 
you can see how to put the preceding tips into 
action:
Original pizza dinner
	
	 3 slices of pan pizza with extra cheese and 
pepperoni
	
	 12-ounce soda
	
	 Nutrition facts: 1,140 calories, 48 grams fat, 
18 grams saturated fat
Pizza dinner makeover
	
	 2 slices of thin-crust pizza with tomatoes 
and mushrooms
	
	 1 side salad with ranch dressing
	
	 Water
	
	 Nutrition facts: 470 calories, 17 grams fat, 7 
grams saturated fat
Making a few simple changes to your pizza 
routine can help you manage all of your health 
goals and also allow you to have some fun 
foods now and then.

Japanese restaurants
Are you a sushi fan? Well, depending on what kind of sushi you prefer, you 
may be happy or disappointed. For the most part, rolls that include rice tend 
to have a higher glycemic load than other kinds of rolls.
	
Some sushi restaurants offer brown rice on their rolls, so be sure to ask for it. 
If you can get this option, it’ll lower your meal’s glycemic load compared to 
the traditional sticky rice.
Other than nonrice sushi rolls, here are some other good lower-glycemic 
options for Japanese cuisine:
	
✓	Sashimi (raw fish without rice): Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy that 
pairs very fresh raw seafood with an appropriate dipping sauce or other 
condiment. It’s a great low-glycemic option because fish contains no car­
bohydrates.
	
✓	Chicken teriyaki: Most of the time this dish is served with rice. You can 
either ask for brown rice or simply eat less of the white rice.
	
✓	Kaibashira (steamed scallops): Ask for a veggie side to go with this dish, 
and you’ll have a great low-glycemic meal.
	
✓	Maguro (broiled tuna): As long as you forgo the sticky rice, this is 
another stellar low-glycemic option!
	
✓	Steamed/grilled fish or skinless poultry with vegetables: Glance over 
the menu to see whether the restaurant has some basic fish and poultry 
dishes served with vegetables.
	
✓	Yakitori (skewered chicken or scallops): An excellent carbohydrate-free 
choice, this dish can be served with a side of vegetables.
	
✓	Yosenabe (seafood and vegetables in broth): Adding the seafood turns 
this healthy vegetable soup into a hearty meal.
Mexican restaurants
Although you need to be very careful of your portion sizes and calories, 
many of the staples of Mexican restaurants (think whole-wheat or corn torti­
llas, peppers, and pinto beans) are low-glycemic foods. Unfortunately, most 
foods in Mexican restaurants are high in fat and calories, but finding a happy 
medium is possible. Look for any of the following dishes for a healthy choice 
when you’re having Mexican:
	
✓	Chicken enchiladas: This dish can be a good choice, but be wary of the 
calories because chicken enchiladas are often made with a significant 
amount of cheese.

Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Chicken or beef fajitas: Fajitas are by far your best pick for glycemic 
load and calories in a Mexican restaurant. They’re lower in fat and calo­
ries, and you can choose corn tortillas (or whole-wheat if available), 
which have a lower glycemic load than white tortillas.
	
✓	Soft chicken or vegetarian taco: Soft tacos are a great option. Just 
remember to watch your portion sizes because soft tacos can come out 
quite large.
	
✓	Ceviche: This dish, a citrus-marinated seafood appetizer, is a fabulous 
option for seafood lovers. It’s heavy on the seafood, so you can order it 
with some sides and easily make a meal out of it.
	
✓	Pollo picado (chicken and vegetables): This is a simple meal that for­
goes any high-glycemic foods — so long as you skip the Mexican rice 
side dish.
	
✓	Grilled fish and chicken breast: Depending on the restaurant, you can 
typically find some chicken and fish entrees served with vegetables or 
beans.
	
✓	Frijoles: Boiled beans are a staple with just about every Mexican entree. 
Black beans and pinto beans in particular are great low-glycemic 
choices. Ask your server whether the restaurant has a vegetarian option 
that isn’t cooked in lard to save on some calories.
	
✓	Tamales: Tamales use corn dough (masa) that can be filled with meats, 
cheese, and chiles.
	
When it comes to tortillas, your lowest-glycemic option is a whole-wheat torti­
lla. If the restaurant you’re at doesn’t serve those, ask next for a corn tortilla, 
followed by a white-flour tortilla.
Middle Eastern/Greek restaurants
Middle Eastern and Greek dishes use such a wide variety of foods that you 
can find some great low-glycemic options if you’re willing to be a little adven­
turous. Check out the following:
	
✓	Chicken Souvlaki: This basic shish kebab can either be made with all 
meat or mixed with vegetables.
	
✓	Chilled yogurt and cucumber soup: Yogurt is a low-glycemic food, 
making this soup a nice, light addition to your meal.
	
✓	Imam Bayildi (baked eggplant stuffed with vegetables): This hearty 
dish is packed with nutrients from all the plant-based foods.
	
✓	Stuffed grapevine leaves: The small amount of rice in this dish means 
it’s still a good low-glycemic choice.

153
 Chapter 11: Guidelines for Dining Out
	
✓	Spinach with lemon dressing: This is a great side to go along with your 
shish kebab or other meat entree. Mix and match to come up with the 
perfect meal.
	
✓	Vegetable and lentil soup: Soups that use low-glycemic foods are always 
a good choice. Most broth-based soups are very low in calories and can 
often leave you feeling fuller and more satisfied with your meal — a per­
fect fit for your weight-loss plan!
	
✓	Hummus: A bean dip made primarily out of chickpeas, hummus is often 
served with pita bread or vegetables. It’s a very low-glycemic food and 
an overall healthy choice. Ask your server whether you can get whole-
wheat pita bread to go along with it.
Thai restaurants
Some of the most popular Thai dishes feature noodles and rice (making them 
higher-glycemic choices). For healthy, low-glycemic Thai choices, turn to any 
of the following:
	
✓	Thai vegetables with chicken and chili sauce: This is a pretty basic but 
spicy meal. If it comes with rice, either omit the rice or just eat less of it.
	
✓	Seafood kebab: Like any kebab, a Thai seafood kebab is an excellent 
choice to order with a side dish of vegetables.
	
✓	Tom Yum Goong (hot sour shrimp soup): This soup will warm you up. 
Its low calorie level and low glycemic load make it great as a starter or 
as part of a meal.
	
✓	Stir-fried shrimp or chicken with vegetables: Thai stir-fries may be a bit 
spicier than regular stir-fries, but that’s why you like Thai food anyway, 
right?

I
f you’ve followed specific dietary guidelines for weight loss or a health 
condition in the past, then you’re all too aware of how easy it is to slide 
back into old habits during the holidays, at parties, and on vacations. Balance 
is the key to staying on track in these situations — but that of course is easier 
to write about than to actually find. If you lean too much toward the modera­
tion side, you can end up going overboard. On the contrary, if you lean too 
much toward the strict side, you can end up being miserable, or worse, miss­
ing out on special occasions.
Healthcare and wellness professionals throw out the word balance all the 
time, but very few of them define what that may look like and how it can be 
realistic for your lifestyle. In this chapter, I help you find that ever-elusive 
balance so you can enjoy special occasions without backsliding for months 
afterward.
Overcoming the Challenges Posed by 
Vacations, Holidays, and Parties
Odds are you’ve experienced setbacks to your weight-loss goals when faced 
with a work party, family or religious holiday, or a week-long vacation. But 
do you really understand why you got thrown off course? Following are some 
reasons why these special occasions pose a problem:

156
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	People insist on giving you high-glycemic, high-calorie food gifts. 
Getting homemade cookies from your friends during the winter holidays 
is common. You may even love to make these treats yourself. Although 
indulging a little is fine, having too many treats can work against you.
	
✓	Holiday gatherings and parties feature a limited amount of healthy 
choices and too much of the high-glycemic, high-calorie stuff. When you 
show up at either of these events, you never know whether low-glycemic 
foods will be on the menu. What you do know is that the number of high-
glycemic, high-calorie foods will be, well, sky high! Being surrounded by 
so many foods can make it difficult to find the right balance on your plate. 
Fortunately parties and holiday gatherings are usually just one-day affairs, 
which won’t hurt your weight-loss efforts. During the holiday season, how­
ever, you may find yourself going to many parties, which makes the ability 
to find that right balance far more important.
	
✓	Your motivation to make balanced choices is decidedly lacking. 
Special occasions can easily lead to a lack of motivation, which means 
not thinking (or caring) about your food choices. It’s almost like an inter­
nal switch turns off during vacations, parties, and holidays, leading to 
unconscious eating.
	
✓	Past conditioning has you thinking it’s okay to eat “all bad foods” on 
special occasions. Many people view foods as good and bad. “Good” 
foods are for regular situations; “bad” foods are for special occasions, 
like vacations and holidays. Do you ever find yourself thinking, “When 
I’m on vacation, I’m going to eat everything bad”? This mindset treats 
the “bad” food like a reward or a natural part of your vacation. Such con­
ditioning can be passed down through families.
	
One or two days of overindulging can’t cause you to gain weight, but several 
weeks or even months of overindulging most certainly can. When you give in 
to any of the challenges posed by special occasions, the effects almost always 
linger for a longer period of time than the actual event.
However, now that you know some of the reasons why holidays, vacations, 
and parties are so tough to get through, you’re better prepared to overcome 
the challenges they present. In the following sections, I share advice for 
eating what you want on special occasions while still staying on track with 
your low-glycemic lifestyle.
Avoiding the all-or-nothing mentality
I’m a firm believer that an all-or-nothing attitude toward dietary guidelines 
is not only one of the biggest diet traps but that it also makes true lifestyle 
change more difficult. Only a handful of people do really well with a strict 
diet protocol (and that’s often only because they must follow a strict diet due 

157
 Chapter 12: Navigating Special Occasions
to a food allergy or gastrointestinal problems). Most people do better with 
a diet that leaves room for flexibility, which is one of the draws of the low-
glycemic diet.
Perhaps you’ve found yourself in the all-or-nothing trap (also known as the 
good-and-bad trap) before. You feel that you’re either being “good” because 
you’re following your guidelines to a tee or being “bad” because you’re not 
following them at all. People fall into this trap during regular times of the 
year, but I see it happen most often during holidays and vacations. Why? 
Because in most cases people have either made a conscious decision that 
they’ll get back on track next month post-holiday/vacation or they’ve decided 
to be completely unconscious and not think about their food choices at all.
	
The problem with the all-or-nothing mentality is that you end up treating your 
new dietary guidelines as a temporary thing and not a part of your low-glycemic 
lifestyle. Telling yourself you’re being good or bad can lead you to think, “Well, 
if I’m going to be bad, then I’d better eat everything now.” When you think this 
way during the holidays or for one or two weeks while on vacation, you run the 
risk of regaining some weight, which often leads to feelings of guilt and frustra­
tion as well as a never-ending cycle of gaining and losing weight.
	
Getting rid of that all-or-nothing mentality helps you realize that you can enjoy 
all foods in your diet. The trick is balancing them so you don’t eat them all at 
one sitting every time you go on vacation or attend a party. Following are 
some suggestions for banishing the all-or-nothing mentality from your mind:
	
✓	Don’t think of slip-ups as failures. Instead, use them as tools to learn 
from for the future.
	
✓	Remember that you’re in this for the long haul. Don’t think of making 
good food choices as a short-term diet. You want to be able to incorpo­
rate all foods to make a low-glycemic lifestyle realistic for you.
	
✓	Embrace a support system. Peers and/or health professionals can 
encourage your weight loss by helping you set realistic goals and main­
tain a positive mindset. (Turn to Chapter 14 for help finding a solid sup­
port system.)
Discovering moderation with high-
glycemic, special-occasion foods
Moderation is more important than ever during special occasions such as 
holidays, parties, and vacations. Creating a balance of low- and high-glycemic 
foods on your plate when faced with the challenges presented earlier in this 
chapter can be difficult — but not if you have a strategic plan of action for 
achieving moderation.

158
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to find moderation with your meals 
on special occasions (for more-general moderation guidelines, head to 
Chapter 9):
	
1.	Scan the area and make a note of all the available high-glycemic, high-
calorie foods you love.
	
2.	Pick your top three most-loved foods from that list.
	
	 Whatever you do, don’t skip this step! Often when you give yourself the 
okay to eat everything in sight, you wind up overindulging on items you 
may not even like that much. I’ve been known to try something like an 
almond cookie even though it isn’t really anything I love and I know I 
could do without it easily. Pick your favorites instead of trying a little of 
everything.
	
3.	Only eat the high-glycemic, high-calorie foods that made your top-
three list.
	
	 As you try to focus on eating your top-three foods, you may dis­
cover that you love lots of different foods that aren’t so good for you. 
Remember: This party/holiday gathering/vacation isn’t the last time you 
can have these foods. You’re living a low-glycemic lifestyle, not following 
a strict diet, so you aren’t going to be deprived of all of these foods. You 
can have them at a later date — and should in moderation, of course. 
For now, either encourage yourself to stick to your top-three foods and 
eat smaller portions of these or get your very top favorite so you can eat 
a little more of this food.
	
4.	Now scan the area for your favorite low-glycemic, low-calorie foods.
	
	 Maybe you really love a tossed greens salad, but you have a mental 
block against eating it at a party or ordering it on vacation. I once had a 
client who loved yogurt but tended to associate it with “diet food” after 
How many calories does it take to gain a pound?
One of the biggest reasons moderation always 
wins out over the all-or-nothing mentality is 
because of the way people gain weight. To 
gain a pound of body weight, you need to eat 
3,500 calories more than the amount of calo­
ries needed to maintain your weight. It’s highly 
unlikely that you’ll consume that much in one 
day of overindulging. However, if you throw 
caution to the wind and eat an extra 500 calo­
ries for every day of your week-long vacation, 
you’ll gain weight. Here’s the math: 500 extra 
calories × 7 days = 3,500 calories, or 1 pound 
of body fat.
No, 1 pound isn’t the end of the world, but for 
many people it’s a major setback. After you 
abandon your healthy guidelines for a week, it 
takes a while to get back on track. “A while” 
can easily turn into another couple weeks and 
subsequent pounds. If you tend to gain and lose 
5 to 10 pounds regularly, this may be why.

159
 Chapter 12: Navigating Special Occasions
eating it while she was on one diet after another. She now eats yogurt 
less often, not because she doesn’t enjoy it but because it’s a mental 
block to restrictive diets of the past. To conquer a mental block of your 
own, simply ask yourself one question: Do you really enjoy this particu­
lar low-glycemic, low-calorie food? If so, you’ll likely enjoy it just as 
much as your higher-glycemic picks.
	
5.	Slow down and enjoy your food.
	
	 The faster you eat, the less satisfied you’ll be — and the more you’ll 
want. I promise you’ll feel more satisfied if you slow down your eating 
and really take the time to enjoy your food.
By following these five steps, you can still indulge in all of your favorite foods 
on special occasions — without wasting calories and increasing your blood 
sugar over foods you don’t really love. Think of it as retraining your brain to 
eat what you love instead of munching on something because it’s there.
Creating balance for the day
Creating balance simply means taking into account all of your various food 
and lifestyle choices for the day. It goes hand in hand with moderation and 
is a good habit to get into. Balancing your food choices and physical activity 
also helps you steer clear of the all-or-nothing mentality (described earlier in 
this chapter) so you can feel okay rather than guilty when you overindulge a 
little here and there.
	
The trick to balancing your day is you have to feel good about doing it. If cre­
ating balance between your food and lifestyle choices seems like punishment, 
then you’ll feel like you’re dieting, and you won’t want to stick to this 
approach. There’s no need to punish yourself for not getting balance “right” 
because there are so many different ways to find a little balance in your day. 
For example, if you’re having a big brunch with your family, have a light lunch 
and dinner (think salad and soup). Another idea may be to just incorporate 
more exercise that day. Doing so helps stop your blood sugar from spiking all 
day and keeps your calorie level a little more under control.
	
To stand a better chance of being able to create balance in your day when 
you’re on vacation or attending a party or holiday gathering, use some of the 
following ideas (or brainstorm your own solutions that will work for you):
	
✓	When you know you’ll have one big meal in a day, eat light for the other 
meals. (Don’t skip the other meals though. That can hurt your metabo­
lism, as explained in Chapter 8.)
	
✓	Incorporate exercise and movement. This may be as simple as taking the 
stairs more often or going on a walk to catch up with a friend or family 
member. If you’re on a destination vacation, take advantage of the fun 
activities that may be available, such as a nature hike or swimming.

160
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	If you go to a party and can’t spot any low-glycemic foods for the life of 
you, just choose smaller portions of the high-glycemic foods that are 
available.
	
✓	Remember that you can have it all while on vacation, so there’s no 
need to splurge every meal of every day. For example, avoid choosing a 
high-glycemic, high-calorie breakfast every day. Instead, eat a healthier 
option on some days and indulge a little on the others. Also, if you know 
you’re going to go to a recommended ice cream parlor one night, make 
sure to eat healthy choices throughout the day leading up to your ice 
cream excursion.
	
✓	Grab or order a smaller piece of dessert, or just share a dessert with a 
friend or family member.
	
✓	Choose smaller portions of high-glycemic foods and bigger portions of 
low-glycemic foods. For example, if you’re faced with potatoes, maca­
roni salad, and a tossed greens salad at a picnic, choose a small serving 
(around 1⁄3 cup) of the potatoes and macaroni salad and fill the rest of 
your plate with the tossed greens salad.
	
✓	Avoid drinking too much. Whether you’re having mojitos at the beach or 
hot buttered rums at a holiday party, drinks add more calories to your 
diet. They may even increase your glycemic load for that meal. Make 
sure to drink plenty of water during the day to stay hydrated because 
dehydration can cause you to feel hungrier than you really are.
	
If you end up having a full day of indulging, don’t get upset. That’s absolutely, 
100 percent not worth it. One day typically isn’t enough to make a difference 
in your weight or health. The goal is to get back on track the next day. Take a 
walk or eat a healthy, low-glycemic breakfast the morning after a day of indulg­
ing. Creating balance in your day (even if it’s the next day) is as easy as that. 
After you get the hang of this balance act, you’ll never again have to endure 
the frustrating weight-loss/weight-gain cycle.
Finding the Meal Items 
That Work for You
When you’re preparing your own meals in your own kitchen, making bal­
anced choices that complement your low-glycemic diet is easy. Throw spe­
cial occasions into the mix — when you often have little to no control over 
the available food options — and finding the foods that work right for you 
takes a little more creativity and planning. No matter the scenario, you can 
always find the best-choice option for your low-glycemic lifestyle. All you 
need to balance your way to success are the strategies and easy solutions I 
present in the sections that follow.

161
 Chapter 12: Navigating Special Occasions
Being prepared for almost anything
Even though you can’t prepare for every circumstance, most of the time you 
do have some idea what to expect. That’s more than enough information to 
make a game plan ahead of the event.
	
Go through this checklist of questions to help you become more prepared to 
find foods that’ll work for you in a variety of special-occasion scenarios. I offer 
strategies for each one to give you some ideas, but you’re welcome to brain­
storm your own strategies too.
	
✓	Is this event a one-time meal or a week-long deal, like a vacation? One 
meal isn’t too big an issue; you can just make the best choices when you 
get there. A vacation is another story. Think about where you’re going 
and what types of foods will be available in either the supermarkets or 
the restaurants so you can plan ahead.
	
✓	Will you have a kitchen at your vacation destination, or will you be 
depending on restaurants? Having a kitchen handy makes a huge differ­
ence for your vacation. When you have your own kitchen, you can shop 
at the local grocery store and create some fabulous healthy meals while 
limiting how much you eat out. If eating out is your only option, that’s 
okay. Just start looking at the local restaurants online to make sure you 
have basic-meal options. If your only options are restaurants that offer 
big, elaborate meals, you’ll be more likely to overindulge at every meal, 
which will inevitably lead to weight gain.
	
✓	Do you have a long drive to get to your destination? If the answer’s 
yes, pack a cooler with some sandwiches, fruits, and other healthy 
snacks. That way you’ll have less of a need to stop for fast food while 
you’re on the road.
	
✓	Do you know the person serving the meal at the party? If so, then you 
probably know her style of cooking. If she tends to prepare high-glycemic, 
high-calorie dishes most of the time, then eat lighter meals for the rest 
of the day.
	
✓	Is the event a holiday meal where you know exactly what will be 
served? A lot of families have traditional menus for holidays such as 
Thanksgiving. When you know the menu in advance, you can better plan 
how to balance out your plate. Load up your plate with the healthier 
foods and go easy on the high-glycemic, high-calorie foods. Stick to 
your top-three high-glycemic favorites and just eat smaller amounts, as 
explained in the earlier “Discovering moderation with high-glycemic, 
special-occasion foods” section.
	
✓	Is the event a one-time party where you have no idea what will be 
served? Don’t worry too much! Make your best choices and remember 
that one meal isn’t going to blow everything for you. Go for a walk that 
morning to get a little extra movement in for the day.

162
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Volunteering to bring a 
low-glycemic side dish
When the special occasion is a potluck (where everyone attending contributes a 
dish) or a gathering thrown by family or close friends, your best bet for regain­
ing some control over your food options is to volunteer to bring a dish. No one 
has to know you’re bringing a dish that fulfills your low-glycemic dietary guide­
lines. To others, you’ll just be bringing a yummy, healthy-looking side.
	
Afraid your healthy, low-glycemic side dish won’t taste good enough for a 
party or that people will turn up their noses? Don’t be. With so many people 
trying to lose weight, lower their cholesterol, or manage their blood sugar, 
having some healthy options at a party or potluck is sometimes a relief!
As for whether people will badmouth the food you bring, well, you’d be 
surprised how much people can enjoy good-tasting healthy food when they 
don’t realize what it is. One of my past clients brought a lowfat pumpkin pie 
to Thanksgiving with very picky relatives (as in the kind who immediately 
assume something tastes boring or bland if it’s healthier). My client just 
brought the pie and didn’t say a word about it. Guess what? She got rave 
reviews, and some of her relatives even asked for the recipe. At that point, 
she had to let the cat out of the bag and tell them it was actually a lowfat, 
low-calorie version of traditional pumpkin pie, but by then the “damage” was 
already done: She’d successfully introduced her family to a healthier way of 
eating without them even realizing it!
Check out Part IV of this book to find tasty recipes for any meal or occasion.
Respecting your host
When you’re invited to a dinner party or other 
event, never tell your host that you’re follow­
ing a low-glycemic diet and ask him or her to 
change the menu just for you. If you have food 
allergies or a gastrointestinal disorder that 
keeps you from eating certain items, that’s one 
thing. Demanding healthier alternatives to com­
plement your weight-loss program is another 
thing entirely. Your host may have other guests 
he or she needs to accommodate, and it can 
be overwhelming (not to mention downright 
rude and insulting) to receive many different 
requests to meet everyone’s needs.
Remember: To avoid disrespecting your host 
while still sticking to your low-glycemic lifestyle, 
offer to bring a low-glycemic side dish (without 
making a big deal that it’s low-glycemic). Or 
just ask what your host is planning on serving 
so you can be prepared.
Here’s a tip: If you want family and friends to 
ask about your dietary preferences, then make 
the effort to do that yourself whenever you host 
a party. Ask your guests, particularly if the party 
is a small affair, whether they have any special 
dietary considerations. Not only will people be 
appreciative that you asked, but they may even 
pick up on your cue.

 Chapter 12: Navigating Special Occasions
Presenting the Best Low-Glycemic 
Food Picks for Special Occasions
A low-glycemic diet doesn’t restrict your food choices too much for special 
occasions. In fact, because a low-glycemic lifestyle is all about moderation, 
you can rest easy knowing that having a few medium- to high-glycemic items 
once in a while won’t ruin your efforts.
Whether you’re at a holiday gathering, on vacation, or at a party, you can 
almost always find some good choices. The following sections cover your top 
low-glycemic picks for these three main types of special occasions.
Holidays
The fall and winter holidays are often the most challenging time for many 
people working toward a health goal such as weight loss. The core culprit? 
All those goodies just hanging around at work and at home. However, when 
you really look at it, many holiday meal items work beautifully with your low-
glycemic diet. Here are some top picks for the holidays:
	
✓	Halloween:
 
• Pumpkin dip
 
• Pumpkin soup
 
• Pumpkin seeds
	
	If it’s not Halloween to you without a little candy, Peanut M&M’s and 
Dove dark chocolates are low-glycemic. They’re still high in calories 
though, so just eat a little bit to avoid overdoing it.
	
✓	Thanksgiving:
 
• Turkey
 
• Green beans
 
• Tossed greens salad
 
• Pumpkin pie
	
	If you’re like me, then of course you want stuffing and mashed potatoes 
too. Go ahead and indulge that craving; just have a smaller portion of 
each one.

164
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Christmas:
 
• Roast beef
 
• Turkey
 
• Seafood
 
• Tossed greens salad
 
• Roasted vegetables
 
• Pumpkin pie
	
	Desserts are probably the biggest challenge at Christmas. Pick your 
favorite and enjoy, but try not to nibble on treats all day.
	
✓	Hanukkah:
 
• Brisket
 
• Roasted chicken
 
• Applesauce
 
• Salad
	
	Latkes are probably the biggest temptation during this holiday. Either eat 
a small amount or try to make vegetable latkes to provide a different spin 
on the traditional potato version (which is definitely high-glycemic).
	
✓	Kwanzaa:
 
• Carrot salad
 
• Succotash
 
• Okra and greens
 
• Red snapper or other seafood
	
	Black-eyed peas are another popular Kwanzaa dish. With their medium-
glycemic load, black-eyed peas are also a good choice.
Vacations
Whether you’re traveling across Europe, going on a cruise, or camping at 
a nearby lake, the main goal with vacations is twofold: Do a little planning 
ahead and remember to balance all foods so you can enjoy yourself and still 
maintain your weight.
	
Because so many types of vacations exist, narrowing down the possible low-
glycemic food options into a list is difficult. Following are just a few tips of 
what to buy or look for on a menu:

165
 Chapter 12: Navigating Special Occasions
	
✓	Grilled, baked, or roasted chicken, turkey, lean beef, or pork
	
✓	Seafood (make sure it’s not fried or dipped in a lot of butter)
	
✓	Side vegetables
	
✓	Side salads and soups (sometimes these may be your only choice for 
veggies)
	
✓	Fresh fruits
	
✓	Hot cereal for breakfast
	
✓	Scrambled or poached eggs with whole-wheat toast
	
Indulging on vacation is okay; just don’t do it for every meal of every day. 
Instead, balance your indulgences with some healthy choices that you enjoy 
just as much. For example, I prefer fresh salmon over steak, so that’s an easy 
choice for me. What are easy choices for you?
	
Although losing weight on vacation is possible, you may just want to set a goal 
to maintain your weight when you’re away from home. Doing so helps you 
avoid unrealistic expectations so you can focus on the more realistic goal of 
not gaining a significant amount of weight (which is where balance and moder­
ation come into play, as explained earlier in this chapter).
Parties
Parties often feature a wide assortment of food choices. Whether you’re 
attending a work party, a graduation shindig, or a summer barbeque, you 
should be able to find some great traditional choices, such as the following:
	
✓	Grilled, roasted, or baked chicken, lean beef, or pork
	
✓	Seafood
	
✓	Side vegetables (raw or cooked)
	
✓	Three-bean salad
	
✓	Bean dips

Putting ideas into action: Balancing 
choices at a family barbeque
It’s one thing to think and talk about balancing 
food choices, but actually doing it is another. 
With any luck, this common real-world example 
can help you get started.
Think of your average family barbeque. The 
foods available at this barbeque are potato 
chips, tortilla chips, fruit salad, hot dogs, ham­
burgers (with white buns), grilled chicken, 
potato salad, macaroni salad, and a tossed 
greens salad.
You can approach this event in one of several 
ways:
	✓	Choose all low-glycemic foods by filling 
your plate with fruit salad, tossed greens 
salad, grilled chicken, and a few tortilla 
chips.
	✓	If you really want a hamburger, have the 
hamburger with the fruit salad and tossed 
greens salad.
	✓	If the potato salad is calling your name, 
choose the grilled chicken, potato salad, 
and tossed greens salad.
As you can see, there are many ways to eat 
what you love and not go overboard with 
high-glycemic, high-calorie foods. It’s all in 
how you balance your choices. When you get 
used to balancing your choices like this, you’ll 
find it easier to lose weight and maintain your 
weight loss long term. You won’t feel deprived 
because you can still enjoy the foods you love in 
moderation.

W
eight loss is always more complicated than simply changing what you 
eat, which is why it can feel difficult to achieve and maintain. If losing 
weight were that easy, far fewer people would end up regaining weight after 
their dieting efforts. What makes losing weight so tough? Weight-loss pitfalls 
such as food cravings, emotional eating, changing habits, past conditioning, 
weight-loss plateaus, and faltering motivation. These pitfalls can even include 
some health conditions, such as insulin resistance and Polycystic Ovary 
Syndrome (PCOS), as well as a past history of having difficulty losing weight.
Awareness is often the first step to conquering weight-loss pitfalls. In this 
chapter, I explore some common pitfalls you may face in your efforts to adopt 
a low-glycemic lifestyle and go over strategies that have worked for many of 
my clients. The good news is your new low-glycemic lifestyle can become an 
important strategy for conquering some common weight-loss pitfalls.
Coping with Food Cravings
Food cravings can occur for a variety of reasons, both psychological and 
physiological. After you know why your food cravings are happening, you 
can take steps to deal with them more effectively. Some common reasons for 
food cravings (as well as how to combat them) are as follows:
	
✓	Unstable blood sugar: This is probably the biggest physiological food-
craving trigger. The food you eat, specifically carbohydrates, increases 
the amount of blood sugar in your body. When you eat large amounts 
of carbohydrates, especially high-glycemic carbohydrates, your blood 

168
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
sugar spikes quickly and then comes crashing down. Following a low-
glycemic diet can help keep your blood sugar stable by providing an 
energy source that digests slowly, producing gradual increases in blood 
sugar and insulin levels. (See Chapter 1 for further details on this topic.)
	
✓	Lack of sleep: Recent research shows that people who don’t get the 
appropriate amount of sleep at night produce more of their “hunger 
hormone” and less of their “full hormone,” leading them to feel hungrier 
during the day, overeat, and consequently gain weight. The study also 
found that these people had more cravings for salty and sweet foods 
throughout the day. To counteract this physiological trigger of food 
cravings, allow yourself seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you 
have sleep problems, contact your doctor for professional help.
	
	Can’t wind down at night? Try drinking a cup of chamomile tea, doing a 
few yoga stretches, reading, meditating, journaling, or any other activity 
capable of turning off your mental to-do list.
	
✓	Low serotonin levels: Some researchers feel that a hormone imbalance, 
specifically low serotonin levels, may be another physiological trigger 
for food cravings. Scientific evidence also suggests that carbohydrates 
may help replenish the body’s serotonin levels (serotonin is a feel-good 
brain chemical). Although there’s no conclusive evidence that eating 
carbohydrates has a calming effect, it may be enough for a quick feel-
good moment. Keeping your blood sugar stable and eating high-quality 
carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables (rather than 
high-glycemic carbohydrates) can help. Exercise also increases sero­
tonin levels and may help decrease food cravings. (For tips on adding 
exercise to your life, head to Chapter 21.)
	
✓	Conditioned responses from childhood: One of the biggest psychologi­
cal reasons people crave food is because they’re conditioned to from 
childhood. Conditioned responses go hand in hand with emotional 
eating (I share tips for fighting emotional eating later in this chapter). 
Infants and young children learn through experience that certain foods 
make them feel better or even make them feel full or emotionally satis­
fied. Perhaps you always had dessert after dinner as a child, or maybe 
you got ice cream when you lost the soccer game. Some of these condi­
tioning cues are okay because they’re once-in-a-while things, but some 
are tougher because they’re daily habits. For instance, if as a child 
you were rewarded with sweets each day for doing your chores, you 
may continue this pattern as an adult, thinking “I worked hard today; I 
deserve this.”
	
	To break away from your conditioned food responses, you may be 
tempted to cut out the food altogether, but doing so will only make your 
craving worse. Instead, eat something similar. If you’re craving ice cream 

169
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Weight-Loss Pitfalls
at night because that’s what you ate before bed when you were little, 
then have a small amount of frozen yogurt or a fruit smoothie. If you’re 
craving chocolate, have an ounce of dark chocolate.
	
✓	Restrictive dieting and restrained eating: Studies suggest that when 
people refrain from eating certain foods, they end up craving them 
more, giving into the craving, and overindulging. As a psychological 
response, they then feel guilty and decide to refrain from eating the 
foods, which only prolongs the food-craving cycle. Severe restrictive 
eating (found in very-low-calorie diets) can also result in a physiological 
trigger — low blood sugar from not eating! Instead of cutting yourself off 
from certain foods, eat small amounts of them. You can also try a lower-
glycemic food that’s similar to what you’re craving.
	
Think about the last time you had a food craving. Can you point to your trig­
ger? Becoming aware of why you crave certain foods can help you overcome 
and prevent these cravings in the future.
Keep in mind that the most common reason for food cravings in people 
trying to lose weight is low blood sugar. Unstable blood sugar can not only 
trigger food cravings but also make them worse. The following sections 
explain how a low-glycemic diet paired with timely eating are your secret 
weapons for fighting food cravings.
Low-glycemic foods to the rescue
Low-glycemic foods stimulate a slow increase in blood sugar; high-glycemic 
foods (as in the ones people tend to crave), on the other hand, trigger a fast 
spike in blood sugar. Excess intake of high-glycemic carbohydrates sets you 
up for a vicious cycle in which your blood sugar and, consequently, your 
insulin levels spike, leading to a blood sugar crash soon after a meal. Your 
body wants to get your blood sugar back up to optimal levels, so it may trig­
ger you to feel hungry again even though you just ate recently. Eating low-
glycemic foods throughout the day helps keep your blood sugar and insulin 
levels stable from morning to night.
	
If your food cravings are due to unstable blood sugar, then a low-glycemic diet 
can help reduce them drastically. If you have other physiological or psycho­
logical reasons for food cravings, following a low-glycemic diet can still help 
because it stabilizes your blood sugar, thereby reducing the intensity and/or 
frequency of your food cravings. I can’t promise you won’t ever have a craving 
again, but you can certainly curb them by following a low-glycemic diet.

170
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Timing is everything
Eating a low-glycemic diet is only half the battle when it comes to decreasing 
your food cravings. The other half involves eating your meals and snacks in a 
timely manner so you don’t wind up with low blood sugar.
	
Anytime your blood sugar gets too low, you end up hungry, and that hunger 
can trigger your urge to eat foods that may not be the healthiest choices. For 
instance, have you ever waited too long to eat and then went straight for the 
potato chips because they sounded good? Or perhaps you had a hectic day at 
work and were so hungry that you decided to stop at the nearest drug store 
for a candy bar instead of driving home and eating the healthy snack of yogurt 
and nuts that was waiting for you. If you’ve ever experienced these types of 
scenarios, you’re not alone. Choosing a healthy snack is always much harder 
when you’re famished.
	
Eating in a timely manner and enjoying a healthy, low-glycemic snack when 
you’re feeling comfortably hungry rather than starving helps stave off food 
cravings. Pay attention to your body’s hunger cues, eat when you feel 
hungry, and avoid getting to the point where you’re starving. (Trying to eat a 
meal or snack, preferably a low-glycemic one, every four to five hours is a 
good guideline.) Also, keep some healthy snacks in your car, purse, and/or 
office so you’re prepared when you start feeling hungry. (For a few yummy 
low-glycemic snack ideas, check out Chapter 19.)
Strategies for Defeating 
Emotional Eating
If you tend to eat more when you’re stressed or sad, you’re engaging in emo­
tional eating, otherwise known as consuming food when you aren’t physically 
hungry in order to feel emotionally satisfied. These emotions or moods can 
be anything from stress, anxiety, and sadness to anger, frustration, loneli­
ness, and even boredom.
	
Regularly eating to make yourself feel better without being hungry almost 
always results in weight gain because you’re eating excess calories that your 
body can’t use as energy. It also doesn’t do much to boost your mood long 
term because the foods people tend to munch on when they let their emotions 
dictate their appetites are sweets and other high-carbohydrate snacks that 
send their blood sugar (and mood) on a roller coaster ride. Following a low-
glycemic diet not only balances your blood sugar but also helps you eat more 
mood-supporting foods.

171
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Weight-Loss Pitfalls
Research shows that eating mood supporters can help boost your mental 
health by improving the chemical composition of your brain, resulting in 
increased alertness, relaxation, and a better memory. Mood-supporting 
foods include
	
✓	Water
	
✓	Vegetables
	
✓	Fruit
	
✓	Oil-rich fish such as salmon
On the other hand, some foods can actually have a negative effect on your 
mood and overall mental health. Specifically, these mood stressors can cause 
irritability, hostility, anxiety, and even depression; they include
	
✓	Sugar
	
✓	Caffeine
	
✓	Alcohol
Notice how fruits and vegetables fall on the mood-supporting side? These 
foods also happen to be low-glycemic, which is just one more reason why fol­
lowing a low-glycemic diet can help with weight loss and overall well-being. 
Of course, embracing a low-glycemic diet is just one aspect of dealing with 
emotional eating. I cover some other steps you can take to begin tackling this 
issue in the next sections.
	
For some people, emotional eating may feel like a difficult challenge. If you’re 
having trouble defeating this behavior, reach out to a therapist in your local 
area who specializes in emotional eating. The extra support may be a good fit 
for you.
Discover your triggers
Overcoming emotional eating is much easier when you understand what trig­
gers the behavior for you. Perhaps your trigger is a stressful day at work, or 
maybe eating is how you’ve traditionally unwound in the evening. The trigger 
is different for every person, and it’s not always clear what exactly it is.
	
To find out more about what drives your emotional eating, keep a detailed 
food record for at least one to two weeks. Include the following information in 
your entries:

172
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	The date and time (including the day of the week)
	
✓	The food you ate
	
✓	How much you ate
	
✓	Your hunger level on a scale of 1 to 10 when you ate (1 being starving, 5 
being neutral, 10 being stuffed)
	
✓	What was going on for you in that moment
You may find that when you’re bored in the evening you tend to go for some­
thing sweet, or that you generally eat more when you’re happy or celebrat­
ing. Whatever you find, by discovering your responses you can create a new 
plan, breaking your old habits and forming new, healthy behaviors.
Find new healthy behaviors
Everyone has emotions and moods that they must deal with on a daily basis. 
Some are obvious, like a stressful day at work; others are subtle, like feeling 
disheartened because someone looked at you in a weird way and you’re sure 
it’s because of the outfit you chose. Everyone has different coping mecha­
nisms for handling these feelings, and some, such as emotional eating, aren’t 
as healthy as others. The trick is to change your behavior to a healthier self-
gratifying one. No matter what, you have to change the behavior so you have 
a new coping mechanism.
	
Your new healthy behavior must be something that’s truly self-gratifying so it 
can easily take the place of the old behavior (in this case, emotional eating).
Here’s an example of what I mean: A client of mine once discovered that she 
ate mindlessly in front of the television every night as a way of unwinding 
after work. She’d start with dinner and then continue eating sweets and other 
carbs into the late hours. After my client recognized that wanting to unwind 
from work was her emotional-eating trigger, she decided that instead of pig­
ging out on sugary snacks, she’d portion out a low-glycemic treat such as 
popcorn or frozen yogurt and then write in her gratitude journal to help her 
remember all that was going well for her. This shift helped her to eat a rea­
sonable, conscious treat and discover an alternate winding-down behavior so 
she didn’t have to depend on the food/television combination.
	
Swapping healthier behaviors for emotional eating isn’t a quick fix. First off, 
finding the right behavior to replace your emotional eating may take some 
trial and error. Second, you’ll likely still have a desire to go back to your old 
habits. It’ll take a great deal of practice until your new, healthier behavior feels 
like a comfortable old habit.
	
Here’s a list of healthy coping behaviors to give you some ideas of what might 
help you kick the emotional-eating habit:

Become a mindful eater
Emotional eating is usually unconscious eating, meaning you don’t really 
think about what you’re eating or why. You can score a major blow to your 
emotional-eating habit by being mindful of the foods you choose throughout 
the day. This awareness allows you to make choices instead of just going on 
auto-pilot and eating whatever’s around.
Following are some suggestions for becoming more mindful of what you eat 
each day:
	
✓	Keep a food journal. A food journal makes you more conscious of your 
choices in the moment. Many people find that they do less unconscious 
eating when they’re jotting down what they eat on a regular basis. For 
tips on starting a food journal, flip to Chapter 6.
	
✓	Pay close attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Believe it or not, 
your body has its own built-in weight-management system, which can be 
described as hunger and satiety (feeling full). Your body literally tells you 
when to eat and when to stop. So that you don’t miss the signals, your 
body even takes matters a step further by making you feel starved if you 
wait too long to eat and stuffed when you eat too much. Paying attention 
to these cues can help you manage your weight more effectively.

174
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
	Ignoring your body’s hunger and fullness cues is all too easy to do when 
you’re eating for emotions, because it often takes more food to feel emo­
tionally satisfied than physically full. Play the full game with yourself 
and pay close attention to when you feel comfortably full. When you do, 
it’s time to try your chosen healthy-yet-self-gratifying behavior (as 
explained in the preceding section).
	
✓	Slow down and be conscious of taste and texture. With all the rush, rush, 
rush in today’s society, people tend to scarf down their food quickly, 
which can make emotional eating that much worse. Why, you ask? Because 
the quicker you eat, the more food you need to feel emotionally satisfied. 
Remember: Eating isn’t a race! Slow down and really pay attention to the 
food you’re eating. Enjoy its taste and texture in a leisurely manner. When 
you do, you find that you discover emotional satisfaction faster and with 
less food. Try this approach out with a few M&M’s or an ounce of choco­
late. Spend as long as you can letting the candy melt in your mouth instead 
of just chewing it, swallowing it, and grabbing some more. I bet you find 
that you “need” much less candy than you thought you did!
Taking care of your emotions in a healthy way
When you’re used to relying on food to cope 
with your emotions — be they happy or sad — 
you may have a tough time coming up with 
other ways of dealing with your feelings. The 
habitual act of eating when you’re stressed, 
bored, or excited happens so quickly that you 
may not have time to think about a different 
behavior to engage in.
So you can have some ideas ready to go, fill 
in the following chart with ways (other than 
eating) that you can take care of the listed 
emotions.

Action You Plan to Take
Anger
Boredom
Comfort
Fear
Guilt
Loneliness
Love
Stress
Next, grab a sheet of paper and list any activi­
ties that you can do when you get the urge 
to overeat. Be sure to include self-gratifying 
behaviors that you know make you feel better, 
such as calling a friend or relaxing in a bubble 
bath.

Breaking Through Weight-Loss Plateaus
When your body can operate efficiently at a particular calorie level, you may 
find yourself at a weight-loss plateau, a point at which you’re no longer losing 
weight despite all of your best efforts. This situation occurs because previ­
ously you were eating fewer calories than you were burning through exercise, 
but now you’re using as many calories as you’re eating.
I promise that you can get past weight-loss plateaus. But first you need to 
forget about your feelings of frustration that you’re not losing weight and 
instead celebrate that your metabolism is working strongly and your body is 
becoming more efficient. Next, check out the following sections, which offer 
advice for how to make sure you’re on track and how to continue moving for­
ward with weight loss.
Evaluating your weight-loss goals
So you’ve reached a weight-loss plateau, but you’re still 10 pounds from your 
goal weight. Before you start hitting the gym for an extra hour each day or low­
ering your daily calorie intake, make sure your weight-loss goal is realistic.
Setting desired weight-loss goals is easy, but the goals people come up with 
often aren’t appropriate for their age or build. Reaching an unrealistic goal 
weight requires much more exercise and a far lower calorie level than is 
healthy. To maintain such an impractical goal weight after you hit it, you need 
to keep up this rigorous pace. The result of setting unrealistic weight-loss goals 
is that you fall into a cycle of gaining and losing weight because the amount of 
work necessary to maintain a really low weight isn’t realistic for the long haul.
	
Here’s a quick calculation for determining your ideal body-weight range:
Turn off the TV to lose weight
Studies have found a direct correlation 
between increased weight and increased TV 
viewing time. Why? Well, for many people, 
watching TV is a trigger to eat — and eat, and 
eat, and eat. Your metabolism actually slows 
down when you watch TV (in fact, it’s almost 
slower than when you’re sleeping!), so eating 
more and burning less spells serious trouble for 
weight loss. If you really want to watch TV to 
unwind, try moving to a different room — one 
that’s farther away from the food — and couple 
TV viewing with a hands-on activity, such as 
sewing or folding laundry.

176
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
For women:
100 pounds for the first 5 feet plus 5 pounds for each inch over 5 feet plus 
or minus 10 percent
Example: a female who’s 5 feet 4 inches tall
100 + 20 = 120 +/– 10% = 108–132 pounds
For men:
106 pounds for the first 5 feet plus 6 pounds for each inch over 5 feet plus 
or minus 10 percent
Example: a male who’s 5 feet 10 inches tall
106 + 60 = 166 +/– 10% = 149–183 pounds
	
Just because you have an ideal body-weight range doesn’t mean you should 
aim for the lowest weight possible, which is what a lot of people try to do. 
Instead of striving to hit the smallest number on the scale, aim for a healthy 
weight range.
Consider the size of your body frame to determine what weight you should 
shoot for within your ideal range. If, for example, you’re a 5-foot-4-inch female 
with a large frame, you shouldn’t aim for a goal weight of 108 pounds. That’s 
far too low of a weight for you. Instead, you want to aim for the top of your 
range, which is 132 pounds.
You may know immediately whether you have a big frame or a small frame, but 
if not, you can approximate the size of your body frame by taking a tape mea­
sure, measuring your wrist’s circumference, and then figuring out where your 
measurement fits in Table 13-1 if you’re a woman or Table 13-2 if you’re a man.

If you’re in your 50s or 60s, you may want to give yourself a weight cushion. 
Reach for a weight that’s within your range, but don’t try to hit the lowest 
number. Getting there can be difficult due to a decreased metabolism and (for 
many folks) a lower level of exercise intensity. Focus on pursuing health and 
wellness, not one particular number on the scale.
	
The number on the scale isn’t the whole picture. Hitting a specific number 
isn’t as important as making sure other health indicators such as cholesterol, 
blood pressure, and blood sugar are good. How you feel about yourself is 
equally important. Being happy and healthy counts for a whole lot more than 
achieving any so-called perfect weight you may have in mind.
Apples and pears: Is your body shape 
leading you to a higher health risk?
There are two common body shapes based on 
bone structure and how the body deposits fat — 
apple and pear. People who gain weight in 
their abdomen and chest have an apple shape, 
whereas people who gain weight in their hips 
and thighs have a pear shape. Research has 
found that your health risk goes up as your 
waist size increases, which spells trouble for 
apple-shaped individuals. Specifically, abdomi­
nal weight gain increases weight around your 
internal organs and is associated with a greater 
incidence of Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, 
heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep 
apnea. This is especially true if your waist cir­
cumference measures more than 35 inches for 
women and more than 40 inches for men.
To determine your health risk based on body 
shape, stand and measure your waist right 
above the hip bone. If your abdomen is mea­
suring high, then you should work on your low-
glycemic diet and incorporate regular exer­
cise to get your waist measurement below the 
danger zone.
Remember: No matter what the shape, all 
excess weight can be harmful by causing 
excess strain on joints and ligaments, a short­
ened life span, and increased risks for the 
aforementioned diseases.

178
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Tracking consistency
Whether you’ve hit a plateau after losing some weight or you’ve had a hard 
time getting your weight to budge in the first place, take the time to track 
your food intake and physical activity. You may feel like you’re eating the 
right foods and exercising regularly, but until you track your food intake and 
physical activity for at least a week, it’s hard to tell. For pointers on starting a 
food journal, head to Chapter 6.
You’d be surprised how easy it is for excess calories, the wrong food choices, 
and exercise inconsistency to slip in without you knowing it. When keeping 
a food journal, you may notice that you increased your starches to three 
servings at breakfast and lunch rather than two. That adds up to 160 calo­
ries right there. You may also find that you really only went on two walks 
this week rather than four or that you ate more high-glycemic foods than 
low ones for the week. These are the small, subtle differences that can really 
affect your results.
Take a look at this food journal in Figure 13-1 as an example.
If you just look at the food choices and balance, this food journal seems great. 
This person is using low-glycemic foods, eating every four to five hours, and 
balancing her intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Her exercise looks 
good too. However, this person’s weight isn’t moving. When you take a closer 
look at the portion sizes, you realize that her calorie intake adds up to approxi­
mately 2,385 calories and that she has increased carbohydrate servings with a 
few meals, which can make her glycemic load higher than she may want.
This person has several options. Because nuts are high in calories despite 
being healthy and low-glycemic, she can decrease her almond servings to 
1⁄4 cup. She can also decrease her toast in the morning to one slice and omit 
the whole-wheat roll with dinner. These moves would not only decrease her 
glycemic load for breakfast and dinner but they’d also lower her total calorie 
level to 1,885 calories, which may be enough to jump-start her weight loss 
again. By omitting one of the nut servings altogether, she can bring her total 
calorie level down to just 1,700.
	
When you review your own food journal for consistency, you want to look for 
the following:
	
✓	Food choices
	
✓	Balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat
	
✓	Portion sizes
	
✓	Exercise intensity and frequency

You don’t have to count calories like I did in this example. Just review the 
portion sizes presented in Chapter 9 to ensure you’re on the right track. 
Portion sizes that are a little too big are one of the subtle ways calories sneak 
in even when you’re eating all the right foods.
Switching up your exercise routine
	
When you hit a weight-loss plateau, you’re certain your goal weight is appro­
priate, and you’ve been tracking your food intake and physical activity, then 
there’s only one surefire way to break through the plateau without resorting 
to lowering your calorie level: Change your exercise program.

180
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
Doing a certain kind of physical activity regularly over a length of time 
conditions the muscles involved in that activity. After your muscles are 
conditioned, they become more efficient and burn fewer calories. Different 
exercise routines work out different muscle groups, and when you change 
your exercise routine to use new muscle groups, your muscles have to work 
harder, burning more calories in the process. So by changing your exercise 
routine every once in a while, you can break through weight-loss plateaus. 
For example, if you’ve been walking daily, you may want to change two of 
those days to riding a bike or swimming so as to use new muscle groups and 
improve your chances for weight loss.
	
If you really love your routine, then make it more challenging by increasing the 
intensity. For instance, if you’re a walker, try going farther, faster, or hitting 
some hills. All of these actions will help increase the intensity of your walk.

M
aking any kind of health change requires a strong support system if 
you want to achieve your goals. A strong support system helps by
	
✓	Giving you an outlet to vent when frustration hits
	
✓	Providing assistance with overcoming challenges and obstacles
	
✓	Holding you accountable so you can stay on track
	
✓	Keeping you motivated
	
✓	Making your transition to a low-glycemic lifestyle easier
	
✓	Offering you advice when you need it
You can find support in a variety of arenas, from professionals and friends 
to the Internet and glycemic index–specific programs. I delve into these dif­
ferent support arenas in this chapter to help you find the perfect support 
system for you.
Knowing When to Seek Help 
from a Professional
For many people, the easiest form of support to find is professional help from 
a registered dietitian. You don’t always need professional help, but when you 
have health issues, such as high cholesterol or a health condition commonly 
associated with insulin resistance, the advice and objective ear of a registered 

182
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
dietician is worthwhile. Professionals are also your best bet for obtaining accu­
rate information when you do have questions and challenges. The following 
sections go into further detail about circumstances in which you may find 
professional help invaluable.
When you have a challenging 
health condition
Everyone is different, complete with his or her own individual health condi­
tions. A one-size-fits-all solution simply doesn’t exist, which is why some 
additional work may be necessary on your part to properly fit a low-glycemic 
diet into your life if you have certain health conditions. For example, you may 
have insulin resistance and need to be stricter with your choices than others 
do, or you may have a completely different issue such as high cholesterol or 
hypothyroidism that needs to be addressed with a few other dietary changes.
	
If you have a challenging health condition and want to try the low-glycemic 
diet, the best way to ensure you’re getting the most accurate information for 
your unique situation is to work with a registered dietician. I encourage you to 
seek out professional help if you have one or more of the following health 
issues:
	
✓	Coronary artery disease
	
✓	Food allergies
	
✓	Gastrointestinal disorders
	
✓	High blood pressure
	
✓	High cholesterol
	
✓	Hypothyroidism
	
✓	Kidney disease
	
✓	Metabolic syndrome
	
✓	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
	
✓	Prediabetes
	
✓	Type 1 or 2 diabetes
	
Find a registered dietitian who specializes in the issues that you have and 
who’s also familiar with a low-glycemic diet. You can then get sound advice 
and support for meshing your preexisting health issue(s) with a low-glycemic 
lifestyle.

183
 Chapter 14: Finding a Support System
When you’re having trouble 
making changes
Professional help can be a good idea when you’re struggling with making 
changes. As a registered dietitian, one thing I’ve discovered is that providing 
advice and information is only one piece of the puzzle. Coaching — helping 
people work these new changes into their lives — is an even bigger piece.
Making lifestyle changes usually takes a combination of time plus trial and 
error. After all, the doing is often much harder than the knowing. I hear 
people say it all the time, “I know what to do; I just can’t do it.” This is where 
a professional can come in handy. A registered dietitian can help you figure 
out the best ways to implement your new health goals. By working together, 
you can try some strategies and then see how they went. A registered dieti­
cian can also serve as an objective listener who can help you look at matters 
in a different way when obstacles arise.
When you need accountability 
and support
Getting professional help with your efforts to embrace a low-glycemic life­
style provides long-term support and accountability. Research shows that 
people who have a long-term support system are able to maintain their 
weight loss for a longer period of time.
	
Acquiring that long-term support goes much more smoothly when you do two 
things:
	
✓	Find a registered dietician with whom you have a good relationship. 
Working with someone you trust and enjoy is crucial to establishing a 
long-term relationship. That way when you have a dietary crisis during 
the holidays and are feeling vulnerable, you instantly have someone to 
reach out to for that much-needed accountability and support.
	
✓	Don’t treat appointments with your dietician as temporary. Many 
people view working with a dietitian or nutritionist as temporary. They 
go in a few times just to get the diet information and expect to never 
set foot in the office again after they have it. Instead of taking this tem­
porary approach, look at your dietician as you would your physician, 
someone with whom you have a long-time relationship and whose 
advice you trust.

184
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
If you have serious issues with emotional or stress eating, you may also find it 
helpful to work with a therapist or counselor. Many people also find support 
this way.
Enlisting the Right Friends 
and Family Members
Sometimes finding other individuals who’re also working on weight loss using 
a low-glycemic diet can be helpful, especially if they’re people you already 
know. Then again, it’s also a great way to make new friends. Either way, 
there’s something to be said about really understanding the pitfalls that may 
occur and celebrating the wins with someone who’s going through the same 
types of experiences.
	
Whether you’re turning to old friends or new for support, make sure they’re 
truly being supportive of your new health changes. Better yet, make sure 
they’re working on their own health goals!
The next sections explain how to involve the right friends, avoid people 
who’ll drag you down, and start up your very own support group.
Knowing which friends to involve
There’s nothing like working together toward health goals when you already 
have an established, trusting relationship. The trick is figuring out which 
friends will offer the best support for you in your weight-loss efforts with a 
low-glycemic diet. Why not just turn to your closest friends? Because they 
may not be the best support system for you if they don’t see the point in the 
changes you’re making.
	
Seek out support from friends and other loved ones who are already living the 
lifestyle you’re aspiring to or who are making similar changes themselves. By 
being open about your efforts and goals, you may just find that some of your 
family and friends are seeking the same support from you, too.
I’m not asking you to give up your other friendships. Just use the more sup­
portive bunch for discussions about your wins, challenges, and the changes 
you’re seeing. Skip this kind of talk when you’re with your other friends.

185
 Chapter 14: Finding a Support System
Avoiding saboteurs
	
Family and friends can be your best support system or your biggest saboteurs. 
You can’t get rid of your family and friends, but you can limit conversations 
about your weight loss or new dietary changes.
Of course, sometimes doing so is easier said than done. It’s one thing to 
divert a conversation if someone starts picking on your food choices at a 
restaurant, but it’s another thing entirely when your spouse brings home a 
chocolate pie right after you tell him or her you want to lose 10 pounds.
No, these family members and friends aren’t just mean people. In fact, they 
probably aren’t even conscious of what they’re saying or doing. If they are, 
perhaps it’s because they feel insecure or because they don’t want to make 
changes themselves. Often taking care of your health puts a mirror up to 
those around you. You can’t help this; it’s a natural outcome of adopting 
healthier behaviors when others around you aren’t.
To reduce your temptation to throw in the towel on your low-glycemic diet, 
you need to find ways of handling such situations. Remember: You can’t 
change people; you can only change your own reactions.
	
Here are some tips for avoiding sabotaging situations:
	
✓	Don’t talk about your weight loss, diet, or exercise with naysayers. 
You may be so excited about all that’s going on that you want to share 
it and let others know how well things are going for you. This is only a 
good idea with supportive people who want to hear your news. Don’t 
bring diet stuff up unless your friends or family members ask you first. 
They may not be ready to make the same types of changes you are, so 
their reactions may not be favorable if you share your news when they 
can’t handle hearing it.
	
✓	Avoid making a big deal about your menu choices when eating out. 
There’s no need to announce that you’re looking for low-glycemic foods 
on the menu. If you do, the naysayers at the table may roll their eyes 
and say, “Oh, you’re at a restaurant. Let it go for one meal.” Find what 
you want to eat on the menu and keep it to yourself whether your choice 
is low-glycemic or low-calorie. Just say, “This sounds good.” That way 
you won’t risk getting thrown off track by peer pressure.
	
✓	Tell your friends and family members when you feel like they’re 
hassling you about your new changes. If comments they’re making are 
upsetting you and possibly even hindering your weight-loss efforts, be 
upfront that you’re bothered. Then let your friends and family know that 
you’re truly happy with the changes you’re making. If that’s what mat­
ters to them, they should stop hassling you.

186
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Be honest with your spouse. If your spouse continues to bring home 
tempting foods, be honest. Let him or her know these particular foods 
are a little too tempting for you and find some treats you can both agree 
on so your spouse doesn’t feel deprived and you can stay on track.
Creating your own support group
If you can’t find the right friends or family members, try making some new 
friends by putting together your own support group that meets on a regular 
basis.
Start by looking around at work or any place where you may have met 
someone who’s also working toward specific health goals and following 
a low-glycemic diet. Even if you find only one person, that individual may 
know someone else who knows another person. Before you know it, you 
have a small support group! Plan to meet once a week for a walk to discuss 
your latest wins and challenges while squeezing in a little exercise at the 
same time.
	
Getting support from peers who are going through similar experiences is so 
valuable and very different than the type of support you can get from others 
who aren’t on the same path.
Surfing the Web for Information, 
Motivation, and Support
Thanks to the Internet, a wealth of peer and professional support is virtu­
ally available at your fingertips. Of course, there’s some bad information out 
there too, and sometimes negative people hop on group forums and ruin the 
supportive vibe. The sections that follow describe some great places to find 
advice and support on the Internet, as well as some issues to beware of as 
you surf the Web.
Exploring educational Web sites
Some people don’t need personal interaction to get that extra motivation 
they’re looking for. All they really need is information, which is when edu­
cational Web sites prove quite helpful. These sites provide information and 
often anecdotal stories from people just like you. You can often find quick 
answers to questions or just read articles to help you get inspired again.

187
 Chapter 14: Finding a Support System
There’s so much to sift through on the Internet that I thought I’d give you a few 
trusted sites for obtaining information on a low-glycemic diet. (Note: For the 
last two sites, you’ll need to search for “low-glycemic diet” on the home page.)
	
✓	www.glycemic.com
	
✓	www.glycemicindex.com
	
✓	www.webmd.com
	
✓	www.mayoclinic.com
	
Want to find trustworthy educational Web sites on your own? Here are a 
few tips:
	
✓	Go to professional Web sites run by researchers or other healthcare 
professionals. Although personal Web sites operated by individuals 
who’ve seen results following a low-glycemic diet may be helpful, you 
can’t always be certain that the information on these sites is the most 
accurate. Professional Web sites, on the other hand, are always reliable. 
Bookmark your favorite sites so you can find them quickly and visit 
them regularly.
	
✓	Look for a newsletter and sign up. Just because a newsletter comes 
from a professional Web site doesn’t mean the information in it is stuffy. 
Newsletters from educational Web sites are perfect for receiving regular 
updates, articles, and inspiration to help you stay motivated.
Getting involved with group 
forums and message boards
One great advantage of the Internet, especially if you’re having a hard time 
finding a supportive environment at home, is the ability to find support 
through group forums and/or message boards. Of course, you may have to 
participate in a few before you find the right one.
	
There are good reasons to use message boards and forums as well as bad 
ones. The good reasons for using message boards and forums are to
	
✓	Obtain general support for motivation and inspiration: Sometimes you 
just need a little motivation, especially if you’ve had setbacks. Simply 
reading others’ stories or reaching out for help can turn matters around 
for you.
	
✓	Discuss challenges and obstacles: Are you having difficulty bringing a 
low-glycemic lunch to work? Are you finding it rather rough to follow a 
low-glycemic diet on the road? Others may have some great solutions 
that worked for them in similar situations.

188
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
✓	Give support to others: Just being there for others can help renew your 
own motivation.
	
✓	Get recipes: Message boards and forums are a fabulous recipe resource 
when you’re running out of ideas for meals or when you have specific 
ingredients in your house and need some ideas for what to do with them.
Never use message boards or forums for the following reasons:
	
✓	To obtain professional advice: I’ve seen some very inaccurate and just 
plain bad advice given out on message boards. Depending on your per­
sonal situation, this advice may even be harmful to you. When you need 
advice, skip the group forums and message boards and turn to a profes­
sional. Save the boards for support.
	
✓	To vent about your life: Although discussing your challenges in the 
hopes of finding motivation and support is okay, venting about your life 
in general isn’t a good idea. Message boards work best when everyone 
comes to the table in a positive way to help one another.
	
If you decide to explore group forums and message boards, be prepared to 
encounter extremely negative and downright angry people from time to time. 
The Internet provides a shield, so those individuals who have a lot of pent-up 
anger let it out frequently because no one can see them or figure out who 
they are.
I’ll never forget my experience participating as a professional on a weight-
loss message board. One of the other participants was a woman who was fix­
ated on low-carb dieting even though that wasn’t the topic of the board. The 
whole thing turned ugly as she critiqued everyone who was following differ­
ent paths toward weight loss than her. The moderator warned her but never 
kicked her off, making the whole experience a dreadful one for everyone else 
trying to participate.
	
When you run into nasty people on message boards, e-mail the moderator to 
request that he or she ban the offending user or reinforce the posting guide­
lines. If nothing changes, find a new online support forum. Dealing with peo­
ple’s anger-management issues is far from worth it when you’re just looking 
for a little support!
Approaching the Web with caution
The Internet is a great tool for finding articles and getting support. However, 
it’s also filled with an abundance of not-so-good information. You really need 
to pay attention to the source of a Web site to ensure the information on it is 
accurate. If you aren’t sure whether information you find online is true, ask a 
professional.

189
 Chapter 14: Finding a Support System
	
If you have a health condition such as diabetes or high cholesterol and are 
taking medications for it, the wrong dietary information can be harmful. I’ve 
seen people end up in the hospital from bad information. I even saw a woman 
in her 30s fight for her life in a diabetic coma due to inaccurate advice. So even 
though most of the time nutrition information you find online doesn’t neces­
sarily cause any major problems, it can cause you serious issues in some cir­
cumstances.
Sites that sell information products or provide information from individuals 
who’ve lost weight following a low-glycemic diet can be good for support, 
but unless the site operators have the proper education or know how to 
interpret research studies, the information they provide should be taken 
with a ton of salt.
	
People aren’t out to give you bad advice; they just may not know enough to 
give good advice. When in doubt about the accuracy of information in a partic­
ular article, check the author’s credentials. Is this person in the healthcare 
field? Has she been trained in this topic? What type of education program did 
she go through? These questions will help assure you that the information 
you’re getting is accurate. You can also look for sites with professional articles 
that have been peer-reviewed by other doctors and registered dieticians. 
WebMD is one such site, which is why it’s one of the best places to find quality 
health articles online.
Attending Glycemic Index Programs
Programs related to the glycemic index, such as classes and conferences, are 
win-win scenarios: You receive information you can trust, and you build a 
new support group with fellow participants. Finding glycemic index classes 
and conferences isn’t always easy, so I offer some suggestions for doing so in 
the following sections.
Group classes
Group classes occur either as series or one-time affairs. Either way, you can 
often find these classes at your local hospital. Start by checking out the hos­
pital’s Web site to see what types of health classes it offers. If you don’t find 
any, you can call the nutrition department and ask whether it ever offers any 
classes on the low-glycemic diet or weight management in general.
Another option for finding group classes is to look for registered dieticians 
who work in private practice in your local area. Do a Web search or pull out 
the phonebook and flip through the Yellow Pages to see whether any local 
dieticians offer classes.

190
Part III: Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles 
	
If you can’t track down a class, find a local registered dietitian and ask her 
whether she’d ever be interested in starting one up. If you can persuade the 
dietician that several people in the community would benefit from the class, 
she may just be willing to give it a go. It never hurts to ask!
Professional conferences
Going to a professional conference on low-glycemic diets may sound a little 
“outside the box,” but it has been done. Healthcare professionals must take 
continuing education classes on many different topics in order to keep up on 
the latest research. If you don’t mind listening to a lot of medical jargon, pro­
fessional conferences can be a great place to obtain the latest scoop on the 
glycemic index.
Note: Not only are professional conferences costly, but in many cases you 
must be a healthcare professional in order to attend, so this strategy isn’t 
always a realistic one. However, I’ve seen many people attend these confer­
ences for their own information. They can be a great way to network and 
meet professionals who’re working in this area of expertise.

tips and suggestions that you can easily incorporate into 
your standard cooking repertoire. I also include recipes 
for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even snacks and des­

C
ooking — it’s a term that either makes you feel at ease or makes you 
want to run for the hills. No matter which side of the fence you’re on, 
picking up a few basic cooking tips can help you follow your new low-glycemic 
lifestyle. (Don’t worry. You don’t need to learn how to sauté in the air, flambé 
a dessert, or prepare ridiculously difficult meals.)
Many people start various weight-loss programs by cooking all new recipes, 
especially when they’re following menu plans. These recipes are handy 
to have and can be helpful, but they can also be a lot of work. Having that 
poached egg for breakfast, chicken salad almondine for lunch, and barley 
risotto for dinner may sound great, but it ends up being more cooking than 
the average person is used to, making it difficult to stay on track for long. 
In a low-glycemic lifestyle, you can still enjoy some of your old standby 
recipes, just with a few small modifications. In fact, modifying your favorite 
recipes is a great first step in implementing the low-glycemic guidelines into 
your daily life.
I cover the basics of low-glycemic cooking for the beginner (and the experi­
enced) cook in this chapter. I also highlight the most nutritious low-glycemic 
foods so you can begin introducing more of them into your diet for optimal 
results.

194
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Evaluating and Modifying 
Your Favorite Recipes
One of the great factors of a low-glycemic diet is that you can still make your 
favorite standby recipes, no matter whether those standbys include stir-fry, 
spaghetti and meatballs, burgers, or tacos. The trick is to do a glycemic make­
over with your favorites by replacing high-glycemic foods with low-glycemic 
substitutions.
Many of your current recipes may already follow the guidelines or just need 
a little tweaking to get there. To figure out whether that’s the case, you first 
need to evaluate what’s in your current recipes. Pull out all of your favorites 
and quick standbys and compare your recipe ingredients with the glycemic 
load food lists in Appendix A.
	
✓	If you find some recipes that use only low-glycemic foods, you have a 
winner! No change necessary.
	
✓	If you have some recipes that use a combination of low- and medium-
glycemic foods, these can also be good choices, but always remember 
to watch the portion sizes. Eating more than a serving will increase the 
glycemic load for that meal.
	
✓	If some of your recipes use high-glycemic foods, don’t throw them out 
quite yet. Put them aside and, in the following section, discover how to 
modify them to fit your new lifestyle.
Recipe modification tips
	
The simplest way to incorporate new low-glycemic foods into your diet is 
by modifying standard recipes. Follow these suggestions to modify your 
current recipes to make them more appropriate for losing weight with a 
low-glycemic diet:
	
✓	Replace higher-glycemic foods with lower-glycemic ones. For example, 
instead of having a high-glycemic bagel, you can choose a low-glycemic, 
100-percent-whole-grain bread. See? Going low-glycemic can be simple!
	
✓	Use smaller portion sizes of medium- and high-glycemic foods to help 
lighten the load. If you like potatoes (a high-glycemic food) as part of 
your meal, you can still enjoy them. Just eat half a potato in one sitting 
as opposed to the whole thing.
	
✓	Add healthy low-glycemic foods. Instead of eating a pasta dish that’s 
heavy on the pasta (okay, a dish that’s all pasta!), toss in some low-
glycemic veggies or grilled chicken to add volume while decreasing the 
amount of pasta used.

195
 Chapter 15: Low-Glycemic Cooking Tips and Techniques
	
✓	Use lean protein sources rather than fatty cuts of meat. Lean protein 
sources include poultry, fish, lean cuts of beef or pork, tofu, and nuts. So 
if your favorite stir-fry recipe calls for a fatty cut of beef, swap that out 
for chicken.
	
✓	Keep added fats (such as cream, oils, and butter) to 1 to 2 teaspoons 
per serving. Simply decrease the amount of fat called for in a recipe, or 
flavor with broth, cooking sherry, or wine as an alternative to fat.
	
These steps will ensure you’re making your meals low-glycemic, but don’t 
forget to keep calories lower at the same time. After all, following a low-
glycemic diet for weight loss is a holistic approach.
Recipe makeover examples
The recipe makeovers that follow show you how to incorporate the recipe-
modification strategies presented in the preceding section. Here you see just 
how easy it is to turn your comfort foods into healthy treats.
	
Modifying your favorite recipes to reduce their glycemic load isn’t a perfect 
science, so these numbers won’t always be exact. The goal is to see how 
changing a few simple things in your recipe can make your glycemic load 
lower. Try not to get too caught up in the numbers game.
Making over chicken and vegetable stir-fry with jasmine rice
The typical four-serving recipe for chicken and vegetable stir-fry served over 
2⁄3 cup of jasmine rice includes the following:
	
✓	16 ounces chicken breast, no skin
	
✓	1 cup fresh snow peas
	
✓	1 cup chopped raw carrots
	
✓	1⁄2 cup chopped raw yellow onion
	
✓	3 teaspoons minced garlic
	
✓	1 tablespoon olive oil
	
✓	1 cup chopped fresh broccoli
	
✓	4 tablespoons reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce
	
✓	4 tablespoons sesame seeds
As you can see, this recipe already features lean poultry, a low amount of oil 
(per serving), and lots of vegetables, so it’s good on the health and calorie 
level. However, jasmine rice falls into the high-glycemic category. When you 
account for the glycemic level of the vegetables, that makes the glycemic 
load of the whole meal a bit high, or 51 specifically.

196
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
To make over this recipe and reduce the glycemic load, use 2⁄3 cup quinoa 
rather than jasmine rice. This simple move cuts the estimated glycemic load 
from 51 to 21! Impressive, huh?
Even better, increase the broccoli to 2 cups and decrease the amount of 
quinoa from 2⁄3 cup to 1⁄2 cup, and the glycemic load falls even further to 18.
	
Your recipe changes don’t need to be significant. Simply changing the grain 
(and, if desired, the amount of it) makes all the difference.
Revamping asparagus and almond risotto
Believe it or not, you can even find replacements for dishes that may seem 
taboo. If you’re a fan of risotto, you know it typically calls for Arborio rice. 
The original recipe for asparagus and almond risotto looks a little something 
like this:
	
✓	11⁄2 pounds medium asparagus, trimmed
	
✓	51⁄2 cups water
	
✓	1 teaspoon salt
	
✓	1 medium onion, finely chopped
	
✓	3 tablespoons olive oil
	
✓	11⁄4 cup Arborio rice
	
✓	1⁄2 cup dry white wine
	
✓	1 garlic clove
	
✓	11⁄4 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest
	
✓	1⁄2 cup grated parmesan cheese
	
✓	1⁄2 cup toasted, slivered almonds
Is it possible to make a risotto without rice? You bet! To give this recipe a 
lighter glycemic load, simply change out the Arborio rice (which has a glyce­
mic load of 36) for pearl barley (which has a glycemic load of 11). This easy 
swap makes a big difference in the healthiness of your recipe (and I promise 
pearl barley still makes a great risotto).
Overhauling traditional potato salad
Following a low-glycemic diet doesn’t mean you have to forsake classic bar­
beque and picnic favorites like potato salad. True, russet potatoes have a 
higher glycemic index than table sugar, making them a tough food to incor­
porate into your new plan. However, you can easily tweak potato salad to 
include some lower-glycemic ingredients. But first, the traditional recipe for 
potato salad:

197
 Chapter 15: Low-Glycemic Cooking Tips and Techniques
	
✓	2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
	
✓	1⁄2 teaspoon salt
	
✓	3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
	
✓	11⁄2 cups minced celery
	
✓	1⁄2 to 1 cup finely chopped sweet onion
	
✓	1⁄2 cup mayonnaise
	
✓	1 to 2 teaspoons prepared mustard
	
✓	1⁄2 cup chopped sweet pickles, with some juice
	
✓	Salt and pepper to taste
	
✓	Dash cayenne pepper
	
✓	1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley (optional)
	
✓	1⁄8 teaspoon sweet paprika
One quick, easy replacement can make your taboo potato salad into a can-do 
potato salad. Although russet potatoes have a glycemic load of 26, new 
potatoes only have a glycemic load of 12 (that’s a medium glycemic load). 
Exchanging your russet potatoes for unpeeled new potatoes is a simple way 
to up the health factor of this old favorite.
Cooking Grains and Pastas
Grains and pastas are probably the most troublesome food category for people 
following a low-glycemic diet because they’re the food group that contains the 
most carbohydrates. Different varieties of low-glycemic pastas and rice exist, 
but there are also several other glycemic grains available. The trick is knowing 
how to cook these grains and pastas (and for how long) and how much water 
to use. The following sections give you the scoop on these details and show 
you how to liven up the flavor of your grain and pasta dishes. For some fun 
recipes that feature low-glycemic grains, head to Chapter 18.
Presenting your whole grain cooking guide
Most people find those bulk whole grain bins at the grocery store rather 
intimidating. The grains seem like they’d be difficult to cook, and the usual 
lack of instructions leaves you wondering how to cook them in the first place. 
If you don’t have experience cooking whole grains, they can easily feel like 

198
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
too much trouble. But in reality, cooking whole grains (which contain more 
fiber and nutrients than white rice) is as easy as making white rice, with a few 
small steps and variations in cooking time.
	
Get started cooking whole grains with these easy tips:
	
✓	Rinse whole grains in water to remove any dirt and debris (this is an 
especially important step when buying from the bulk bins). Simply add 
grains to a pot of cold water and swish them around with a large spoon. 
Drain them into a colander, and you’re ready to cook.
	
✓	Simmer your grains by first adding the appropriate amount of liquid (see 
Table 15-1) and bringing that to a boil. Then place a lid over your pot 
and lower the heat to simmer for the suggested cooking time.
	
✓	Add a few teaspoons of oil to the water or broth to help avoid sticking.
Table 15-1 breaks down the cooking instructions for various whole grains. Use 
it as a guide and explore some new foods or some that you’ve enjoyed in the 
past and want to bring into your diet again. After all, experimenting with grains 
not only helps with your new diet but also increases the variety of what you 
eat, boosting vitamins, minerals, and fiber. (Note: Yes, some common grains 
are missing from this chart. That’s because I chose to include only those grains 
that have been tested for the glycemic index and are low to medium.)

Exploring low-glycemic pastas
Most pastas have a medium to high glycemic load. Believe it or not, pastas 
stuffed with cheese or meat tend to have a lower glycemic load because the 
stuffing takes up more volume than just plain pasta for the same portion size. 
On the flip side, pastas made out of rice or potato tend to have a higher gly­
cemic load because the rice and potato starch have a higher glycemic load 
than wheat starch.
	
Just because pasta tends to be a higher-glycemic food doesn’t mean you have 
to omit it from your diet altogether. Simply choose pastas that have a medium 
glycemic load and eat pasta less often.
Table 15-2 features a quick breakdown of some lower-glycemic pastas.

When it comes to cooking pasta, al dente pasta (which is cooked somewhat 
firm) has the lowest glycemic load. The longer you cook pasta, the softer it 
gets — and the higher the glycemic level becomes, as you can see from the 
following chart that tracks the glycemic load of spaghetti based on how long 
it has been cooked.

The downside to cooking your pasta al dente is that the volume decreases a 
bit, which can increase the calorie level. This fact means that ¾ cup of pasta 
cooked al dente won’t expand as much because it doesn’t contain as much 
water as pasta that’s cooked for a longer time. So 1 cup of regular pasta may 
be about the same calorie level as ¾ cup of al dente pasta. However, this dif­
ference isn’t anything to be overly concerned about.

Livening up your grains and pastas
As you try some new grains, they may taste bland or in some cases too 
strong. Don’t give up right away. Whole grains can be delicious with the right 
seasoning and preparation. Here are some suggestions for adding a bit more 
flavor to your grains:
	
✓	Use rice, grains, or pasta with stir-fry, or mix them with other foods.
	
✓	Try chicken or vegetable broth (low-sodium or regular) in place of 
water, but don’t add salt because broth already has enough sodium.
	
✓	Use fresh or dried herbs to liven up your plain grain dishes, especially 
pearl barley, quinoa, or wild rice.
	
✓	Try adding some toasted nuts to your pasta, rice, and grains to create a 
heartier flavor.
	
If you want to improve the flavor of quinoa, which has a natural bitter taste 
that decreases with soaking, wash it prior to cooking and let it soak for 30 
minutes.
Experimenting with Vegetables
Vegetables are an important part of losing weight with a low-glycemic diet. 
They’re low-glycemic, high-fiber, and low-calorie; they also provide an abun­
dant amount of nutrients. Indulging in a variety of vegetables is truly the way 
to eat more volume and not feel deprived while losing weight.
	
Other than most root vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, and yams), all 
vegetables are considered low-glycemic. They contain such a small amount of 
carbohydrates per serving that researchers don’t even bother testing their 
glycemic loads. So feel free to load up on the veggies you enjoy, be they broc­
coli, salad fixings, asparagus, or cauliflower, because almost any vegetable is a 
good choice for your low-glycemic diet.
Cooking vegetables the low-glycemic way isn’t really too different from the 
way you may be used to. The following sections cover a few preparation and 
cooking tips to help you figure out how to do it.
Preparing low-glycemic vegetables
Many vegetables, both raw and cooked, have been tested for their glyce­
mic load, and the difference in levels between the raw and cooked veggies 
(regardless of how they’re cooked) is far from drastic. But that doesn’t 

201
 Chapter 15: Low-Glycemic Cooking Tips and Techniques
mean there aren’t better ways to cook veggies than others. The best cook­
ing methods for vegetables include steaming, baking, broiling, grilling, 
microwaving, or lightly sautéing.
	
Here are two specific healthy-cooking tips for vegetables:
	
✓	Wash vegetables thoroughly with warm water. Although your veggies 
may be low-glycemic, they may also have pesticides on them. If you 
choose organic, your veggies can also have some dirt, debris, or even 
small worms. Washing is a good first step with all vegetables, regardless 
of whether you’re eating them raw or cooked.
	
✓	Avoid frying your vegetables. Frying veggies adds more fat and calories 
and interferes with your weight-loss progress.
Boiling versus other cooking methods
Although the difference isn’t large, boiled vegetables tend to come up higher 
in glycemic load than vegetables prepared by other methods. For example, 
boiled corn has a glycemic load of 9.7, and corn that’s previously frozen and 
reheated in the microwave has a glycemic load of 7.6. Both glycemic loads 
are low, but there’s a subtle difference.
Boiling vegetables often causes them to lose more vitamins and minerals into 
the water compared to other cooking methods. I’m not saying you can’t ever 
boil a vegetable, but if you have a choice, choose a different method to keep 
your glycemic load down and nutrients up.
	
How long you cook your vegetables can also affect glycemic load. Most veg­
gies retain more nutrients when cooked al dente. The longer you cook most 
vegetables, the more nutrients you can lose. (Onions, garlic, and tomatoes are 
a few of the exceptions to this rule.) For the most part, a good rule of thumb is 
to cook your vegetables lightly.
Introducing Beans, the 
Truly Magical Fruit
If you’re not familiar with the class of foods known as legumes (which 
includes beans, lentils, and peas), you’re missing out. The all-star legumes, 
beans, really have it all. Beans are low-glycemic, high-fiber, high-protein, 
and packed with important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These little 
foods are also very convenient to cook or add to a meal. And as a bonus to 
the dieter, beans help you feel fuller for a longer period of time.

202
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
The next sections show you the difference between canned beans and dried 
beans and provide cooking tips for both types. Get ready to be a bean novice 
no more!
Pointing out what you should know 
about canned beans versus dried
You have one major choice when it comes to beans: canned or dried. Canned 
beans are already cooked, so you can use them instantly on a salad or in 
soups and other hot meals. Dried beans, on the other hand, need a little prep­
aration before you can enjoy them. Specifically, dried beans must be soaked 
before you can cook them. Not only is soaking dried beans the only way to 
get them clean before cooking but it also helps
	
✓	Decrease their overall cooking time
	
✓	Remove gas-producing compounds from the outer coating of the shell
	
✓	Retain nutrients
	
Making small changes in the way you prepare foods can greatly impact the 
foods’ glycemic content. Canned beans and dried beans often have different 
glycemic levels. Sometimes the canned is higher than the dried; other times 
the dried is higher than the canned. These differences are subtle and 
shouldn’t make a large impact on your choices. Why? Because you’re not get­
ting too caught up in small number variances. The numbers still fall within a 
low or medium range, so you’re in good shape regardless.
Preparing and cooking both kinds of beans
Similar to whole grains (covered in the earlier “Presenting your whole grain 
cooking guide” section), beans may seem intimidating, but they’re not 
as bad to work with as you may think. Granted, dried beans require a bit 
more preparation, but cooking them is a fairly straightforward process. Of 
course, if you really don’t want to tackle the soaking and cooking steps of 
dried beans, you can easily use canned ones. Regardless of which way you 
go, the following sections present some quick preparation and cooking tips.
Canned beans
Whether you want the convenience canned beans offer or you just prefer the 
taste of them, keep the following in mind:

203
 Chapter 15: Low-Glycemic Cooking Tips and Techniques
	
✓	If you’re adding cold beans to a salad, rinse them in a colander. Doing so 
removes the saucy liquid and helps decrease some of the sodium used 
as a preservative.
	
✓	When adding canned beans to a hot dish, make sure to add them 
toward the end of cooking. Otherwise they can become too soggy and 
fall apart.
Dried beans
Eating dried beans requires a little more upfront work, but it’s certainly 
worth it. First things first: preparation. Preparing dried beans for cooking 
involves soaking them in one of two ways:
	
✓	A leisurely soak is the most common method for preparing dried beans. 
Soak ’em in a large pot of water overnight. Afterward, simply discard the 
liquid and cook with fresh water.
	
✓	You can also soak your dried beans the quick way. Bring water to a 
boil, remove it from the heat, and let the beans soak in the hot water 
for three to four hours. Discard the liquid and then cook the beans in 
fresh water.
To cook dried beans after soaking, cover about 1 pound of beans with 6 cups 
of fresh water (not the soaking water). Simmer the beans until they’re cooked 
and soft. Table 15-3 shows you some great low-glycemic beans along with 
their cooking times (which depend on whether you’re cooking in a saucepan 
or a pressure cooker).
A tale of old beans
Have you ever bitten into cooked beans and 
gotten one that was hard as a rock? No, you’re 
not a horrible cook who didn’t soak her beans 
long enough or cook them long enough. The 
real problem is that the bean was an HTC, or 
“hard to cook” bean (quite the technical term, I 
know). HTC refers to beans that are old or have 
been stored improperly. Telling one of these 
beans from a good bean when dried is abso­
lutely impossible, but you can take a few steps 
to avoid getting these little HTC rocks, I mean 
beans, in your bunch:
	✓	Check the package dating to make sure the 
beans aren’t already past their due date.
	✓	Buy dried beans from a grocery store that’s 
more likely to have a quicker turnover rate.
	✓	Store beans in a dark, cool area in an air-
tight container.

Your waistline will thank you
If you fall into a rut of using only one or two low-
glycemic grains, breads, fruits, or vegetables, 
you’ll feel deprived quickly. Imagine if you 
only use pearl barley with dinner every night 
because it’s an easy low-glycemic grain to 
add to your diet. Yawn. I bet you’ll get bored 
quite quickly. Research shows that feeling 
deprived or restricted with food can backfire and 
interfere with weight loss. Many individuals 
who feel restricted end up binging on foods 
they feel are “bad.”
I’m here to tell you that living a low-glycemic 
lifestyle doesn’t have to be restrictive. You have 
many food options to choose from, so get out 
there and experiment with different foods and 
recipes so you don’t ever feel limited. Having 
a wide variety of low-glycemic choices at 
your disposal every day is guaranteed to keep 
you from getting stuck in the food doldrums. I 
encourage you to experiment with your old 
standby recipes and check out some new ones.

reakfast is the meal of weight-loss champi­
ons, yet it’s the meal most often skimped on 
or just plain skipped. People of all ages — adults, 
teens, and children — have different reasons for 
missing a healthy breakfast. Some feel they’re 
simply too busy in the morning to grab some­
thing; others just don’t feel hungry in the morn­
ing. Whatever the reason, they’re missing out. Years of research show that 
a healthy breakfast each day benefits all age groups. However, the “healthy 
breakfast” part is what many of the people who do eat breakfast aren’t getting 
quite right. Their morning meal may be so low in calories and protein that it 
doesn’t do a sufficient job.
If you’re a notorious breakfast-skipper, or if you’re addicted to high-glycemic, 
sugary breakfasts, you may think throwing low-glycemic foods into the mix 
makes managing breakfast even more of a task. But I promise it’s easier than 
you may expect. Use this chapter to come up with some new ideas and moti­
vation for breakfast. Whether you want a grab-and-go granola bar or a hearty 
egg scramble, numerous low-glycemic breakfast options await you for each 
day of the week.

Understanding Why Breakfast 
Is So Important
What’s all the fuss about breakfast? So much more than all that business 
about the importance of getting in three meals a day. Research is finding 
more and more health connections to breakfast, making it a meal that you 
don’t want to skip. The next sections cover just exactly why breakfast is such 
an important meal (other than “because your mother told you so”).
Reviewing the health benefits of breakfast
You probably give breakfast little thought as you wake up in the morning, 
but did you know it can actually help you with your weight-loss efforts, boost 
your job or school performance, and just plain make you feel better? So many 
benefits from one simple meal!
	
Following are some of the specific ways breakfast makes a big difference in 
your well-being:
	
✓	It refuels you for the day ahead. Breakfast literally means to break a 
fast. After eight to ten hours without food, your body needs to replen­
ish its blood sugar supplies. Most importantly, your brain needs a 
fresh supply of blood sugar to use as its main energy source, because it 
doesn’t have any storage capacity like your muscles do. That means it 
needs to refuel each morning so it has the energy for sustained mental 
work. Your muscles also need a fresh supply of blood sugar to help fuel 
your physical activity.
	
✓	It improves your mood and attitude. According to research, breakfast-
skippers tend to feel tired, irritable, and restless in the morning com­
pared to breakfast-eaters, who show better attitudes toward work and 
school and have better productivity throughout the day.
	
✓	It strengthens your mental skills. Research has also found that breakfast-
eaters have improved memory as well as better concentration and 
problem-solving abilities. Don’t believe it? Think of the studies of chil­
dren who eat breakfast and have better concentration and do better on 
tests. Isn’t it amazing how one simple meal can help you perform better 
on mental challenges and tasks?
	
✓	It supplies you with ample nutrients. Eating the recommended five to 
nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day can be tough when you 
try to fit all of those servings into just two meals. Breakfast-eaters tend 
to get in more of their daily recommended vitamins and minerals than 
non-breakfast-eaters.

207
 Chapter 16: Breakfast Recipes to Start Your Day Off Right
	
✓	It helps control your weight. Yes, that’s right. Eating breakfast can 
actually help you lose weight. Even though what you eat at breakfast 
still counts toward your total calories for the day, research shows that 
individuals who eat breakfast tend to feel more satisfied and eat fewer 
calories and fat throughout the day, making eating your breakfast each 
day an important weight-loss strategy. Eating a healthy breakfast also 
helps keep your metabolism running strong (flip to Chapter 8 for the full 
scoop on metabolism).
Feeling fuller for longer with the 
right balance at breakfast
Do you ever feel ravenous 30 minutes after eating breakfast? If so, you’re not 
alone. I often hear this complaint from my clients. The hunger you’re expe­
riencing has more to do with what you’re eating than with normal hunger 
cues. Many people eat the wrong combination of foods in the morning, which 
can stimulate their appetite in a strong way. This is where your low-glycemic 
choices come in handy. When you eat a high-glycemic food for breakfast 
with little else, that food creates a spike in your blood sugar. Eventually your 
blood sugar comes crashing down, leaving you feeling famished. Eating low-
glycemic foods for breakfast helps prevent this fast spike and keeps you feel­
ing satisfied for longer.
	
The best way to avoid stimulating your appetite and guarantee you’ll feel fuller 
for longer is to combine low-glycemic foods with protein and/or fat, both of 
which (like low-glycemic foods) release energy more slowly. So, for example, 
instead of eating puffed rice cereal with a little milk, opt for oatmeal with wal­
nuts and milk. Puffed rice is a higher-glycemic grain, and although milk has fat 
and protein, usually little of it is used on cereal. These factors lead you to feel 
hungry very quickly, whereas the lower-glycemic oatmeal plus the protein and 
fat in the nuts keep you feeling fuller for a longer period of time.
If you’re a breakfast-skipper, you may find that you don’t feel hungry in the 
morning at all, but when you start to incorporate breakfast, suddenly your 
hunger kicks into gear. Don’t worry. That’s a good sign! Your body should 
feel hungry in the morning (and frequently throughout the day) to signal that 
it’s time to eat. Hunger signals that feel like a gradual hunger rather than an 
extreme famished feeling are a sign of a good metabolism. Many individu­
als have fallen out of touch with what hunger and fullness feel like, which 
can make losing weight and maintaining any weight loss more of a challenge 
because they aren’t used to eating at the appropriate times.

208
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Going on the Run with 
Grab-and-Go Starters
Some mornings you may not have time to prepare anything for breakfast. 
Other mornings you may find it hard to eat very much. Regardless of the cir­
cumstances, eating something small for breakfast is better than eating noth­
ing at all so your body can replenish its blood sugar stores.
A good strategy is to have a quick grab-and-go starter and then enjoy a 
midmorning snack a little later. (This strategy works especially well if you 
find that eating one large breakfast in the morning can actually make you 
feel sick.) Spreading out your breakfast not only keeps you from feeling like 
you’ve eaten too much but also provides you with some blood sugar and 
helps keep your metabolism running strong.
	
Here are a few quick low-glycemic grab-and-go starter ideas:
	
✓	Two slices of whole-wheat toast with 2 teaspoons peanut butter or 
almond butter
	
✓	Two slices of whole-wheat toast with 1 ounce of melted mozzarella (a 
lower-calorie/fat cheese)
	
✓	One hard-boiled egg and two slices of whole-wheat toast
	
✓	1 cup lowfat yogurt mixed with 1⁄2 cup fresh berries
	
✓	1⁄2 cup cottage cheese and a piece of fruit
Chowing Down on Cereals
What could be a more classic breakfast option than cereal? Most cold cereals 
tend to have a higher glycemic load, but some have glycemic loads that are 
in the low to medium range. If you’re a cold cereal fan, consider trying one of 
these options (just remember to watch your portion size):
	
✓	Cheerios
	
✓	Fiber One
	
✓	Kashi GoLean
	✓	Kellogg’s All-Bran
	✓	Kellogg’s Bran Flakes
	✓	Life
Want another lower-glycemic breakfast option? Try hot cereals. Oatmeal and 
grits are two hot cereals that end up with a low to medium glycemic load as 
long as you stick to a serving size of 2⁄3 cup or less cooked cereal.

209
 Chapter 16: Breakfast Recipes to Start Your Day Off Right
	
To give your hot cereal some pizzazz, try any of the following suggestions:
	
✓	Add your favorite low-glycemic fresh fruit. Berries, peaches, and even 
bananas work great in oatmeal.
	
✓	Make some quick baked apples and add them to oatmeal. Baked apples are 
soft and add a touch of cinnamon to your meal; see the following recipe.
	
✓	Spice up your oats with cinnamon, ground nutmeg, allspice, or cloves.
	
✓	Heat up your grits by adding jalapeños or hot sauce.
	
✓	Add cayenne pepper, chili powder, or cumin to grits to give ’em a kick.
	
✓	Sprinkle a little shredded cheese on your grits and let it melt in.
	
T Baked Apples for Oatmeal
Baked apples are a wonderful topping for your oatmeal (as well as a great snack all on 
their own). They’re also quite easy to prepare. Here’s a quick-and-dirty recipe for baked 
apples. (Note: If you’re unsure of the best way to core and slice an apple, check out 
Figure 16-1.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
4 sweet apples (Fuji or Gala), peeled, cored, and 
sliced into 1-inch chunks
1⁄2 cup apple juice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	Mix the apples, apple juice, and cinnamon in a bowl until the apples are well coated. 
(You can add more cinnamon depending on your taste.)
	 3	Pour everything into an 8-x-8 glass pan and cover the pan with aluminum foil.
	 4	Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the apples are soft.
	 5	Serve over cooked oatmeal.

Getting a Quick Start with Smoothies
When you want a quick breakfast, smoothies are a healthy choice. They take 
just minutes to prepare, and you can bring them with you or drink them 
while you’re getting ready for your day.
	
The trick with smoothies is to watch how much you drink. Because smooth­
ies are a beverage, they can be very deceiving. Restaurant and smoothie 
bar servings are much too large, giving you an excess of calories and sugar. 
(More specifically, restaurant smoothies are often up to 24 ounces in size and 
total about 600 to 800 calories.) To make matters worse, people often think 
of smoothies like they do a typical drink and eat more food with them, bump­
ing their total number of calories for that particular meal way up. Limit your 
smoothie servings to 8 to 12 ounces and keep in mind that a smoothie is a 
meal in itself. You don’t need to eat other foods with it.

T Almond Banana Smoothie
Almond milk plus bananas equals a great flavor combination. The nutmeg in this 
smoothie recipe tops it off, making you wonder whether you’re enjoying breakfast or a 
delicious treat.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 large ripe bananas, peeled and sliced
1 1⁄2 cups almond milk
1⁄2 cup vanilla nonfat yogurt
2 cups ice cubes
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Ground nutmeg to taste
	 1	Blend all the ingredients in a blender until smooth.
	 2	Divide the smoothie among 4 glasses.
Per serving: Calories 120 (From Fat 17); Glycemic Load 9 (Low); Fat 2g (Saturated 1g); Cholesterol 2mg; Sodium 
780mg; Carbohydrate 25g (Dietary Fiber 2g); Protein 3g.
	
When making your own smoothies, try freezing the fruit ahead of time and 
eliminating the ice from the instructions. Doing so speeds up the smoothie-
making process and adds a nice shakelike consistency without the risk of ice 
chunks. To freeze fruit, simply wash or peel it and place it in a freezer bag.
Following are a few low-glycemic smoothie recipes that range in flavor from 
fruity to nutty.

yogurt offer some protein and fat to round out the mix. (If you want to, you can use 
plain yogurt rather than vanilla.)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄2 cup strawberries
1⁄4 cup blueberries
1⁄4 cup raspberries
1 banana
1⁄2 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt
1⁄2 cup lowfat milk

T Peanut Butter Smoothie
Peanut butter fans can rejoice over this smoothie, which is a little higher in protein and 
fat, making it a bit more satisfying than your average smoothie meal. This smoothie is 
really very light, and the peanut butter isn’t overwhelming because it’s balanced with 
the banana and milk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
2 tablespoons creamy reduced-fat peanut butter
1⁄2 cup lowfat milk
 1 banana
1 teaspoon honey
1⁄2 cup ice cubes
	 1	Blend the peanut butter and milk together for about 5 seconds.
	 2	Add the banana, honey, and ice cubes and blend until smooth.

Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Preparing Ahead for a Week’s Worth 
of Fast Breakfast Choices
Doing a little preparation ahead of time is a great way to have healthy, home­
made breakfasts on hand during your busy week. After you have them pre­
pared, they become quick grab-and-go starters for your day. Following are a 
few make-ahead recipes that I think you’ll really enjoy.
	
T Almond Granola
Almonds, oats, and honey are lower-glycemic foods that are also known to help lower 
cholesterol. This healthy breakfast recipe contains all of these ingredients to keep your 
heart strong and healthy. It also makes for a hearty and filling meal. Be sure to store it 
in an airtight container after it cools so that it stays dry and crisp.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 24 servings
6 cups rolled oats
1 cup slivered almonds
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄2 cup honey
1⁄2 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	Mix the oats, almonds, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl and then set the mixture 
aside.
	 3	Mix the honey, canola oil, and vanilla extract until it reaches a smooth consistency. 
Pour the honey mixture into the oat mixture and mix together until the oat mixture is 
well coated.
	 4	Spoon the mixture into a greased 13-x-9 glass baking dish. Bake for 40 minutes, or until 
golden brown, mixing every 15 minutes so the granola cooks evenly. Remove the gra­
nola from the oven and let it cool.

T Oatmeal, Almond, 
	
Cranberry Bars
Breakfast bars are perfect for an on-the-go breakfast. After you have them made, they’re 
easy to take on your way out the door and still provide a fairly substantial start to your 
day in one small serving. An Oatmeal, Almond, Cranberry Bar is a great breakfast choice 
if you often find yourself short on time during the week.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 16 servings
11⁄2 cups rolled oats
3⁄4 cup slivered almonds, plus 2 tablespoons
1⁄2 cup dried cranberries, sweetened
1⁄2 cup wheat germ
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1⁄3 cup trans fat–free margarine or butter
1⁄4 cup packed brown sugar
1⁄3 cup honey
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	In a bowl, stir together the rolled oats, 3⁄4 cup almonds, cranberries, wheat germ, cinna­
mon, and nutmeg. Set aside.
	 3	Melt the margarine or butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir the brown sugar and 
honey into the melted margarine or butter and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the 
heat.
	 4	Pour the margarine or butter mixture over the rolled oats mixture and stir until the 
rolled oats mixture is well coated. Press the granola bar mixture into a greased 8-x-8 
square baking pan. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of additional almonds.
	 5	Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until slightly browned around the edges, and remove from the 
oven. While the granola’s warm, press the surface gently with the back of a spoon to 
flatten the mixture. Then score it into bars with a knife.
	 6	Cool completely prior to cutting into 16 pieces and serving.

T Granola and Blueberry Parfait
This quick-and-easy breakfast recipe seems more like a dessert even though it’s a per­
fect balance of low-glycemic grains, dairy, and fruit. Feel free to swap the vanilla yogurt 
for plain if you want a little less sweetness.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1⁄4 cup Almond Granola (see the recipe earlier in 
this chapter)
1⁄2 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt
1⁄4 cup fresh blueberries
	 1	Prepare the Almond Granola recipe.
	 2	In a parfait glass or bowl, layer half of the granola, half of the yogurt, and half of the 
blueberries. Repeat with the remainder of the ingredients and serve for a quick, deli­
cious breakfast.
Vary It! If blueberries aren’t in season, just use whichever berries are in season (strawber­
ries, raspberries, blackberries, and so on), or make a mix of several different berries.

Cooking Eggs for Breakfast 
When You Have More Time
Quick breakfasts are great for busy weekdays, but on the weekends, you 
may want to slow down and make a little something special for breakfast. 
Pancakes and waffles can be a bit tough to prepare in a low-glycemic way, but 
low-glycemic eggs are easy to whip up. They also offer an excellent source of 
protein.
	
Eggs used to get a bad rap because of the amount of cholesterol and saturated 
fat they contain. However, recent research has shown that eggs actually have 
little effect on heart health. Previously you were only supposed to have three 
egg yolks per week; according to today’s recommendations, you can now 
safely eat one egg yolk per day.

Did you know egg farmers are now producing healthier options? Egg farmers 
who feed their hens natural foods, such as whole grains and vegetables, are 
selling eggs with lower saturated fat and cholesterol levels. Look for products 
that give you details on how the hens are fed for the healthiest egg choices.
Read on for some of my favorite low-glycemic egg recipes that are perfect for 
a lazy weekend morning.
	
T Puffed Chile Relleno Casserole

T Veggie Frittata
I’ve never been good at flipping omelets, so I love the idea of a frittata like this basic 
veggie one. You get eggs stuffed with lots of spices and vegetables without the fuss of 
making an omelet.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1 yellow or orange bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 medium zucchini, chopped
2 cups (packed) spinach leaves, torn into 1-inch 
pieces
3 large eggs
6 large egg whites
2 tablespoons skim milk
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 ounce shaved parmesan cheese
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the yellow 
onion and bell pepper (see Figure 16-2 for pointers on coring and seeding a pepper); 
sauté until golden, about 8 minutes. Add the zucchini; sauté until tender, about 5 min­
utes. Add the spinach; stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Pour off any liquid.
	 3	Grease an 8-x-8 glass casserole dish. Spread the sautéed vegetable mix onto the surface 
of the dish.
	 4	Whisk the eggs, egg whites, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to blend. Pour the 
egg mixture over the hot vegetables in the casserole dish and stir gently to combine. 
Sprinkle with the chives.
	 5	Bake 35 minutes, or until the frittata’s center starts to firm. Remove the frittata from the 
oven and sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Return the frittata to the oven and continue 
baking for 5 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
	 6	Sprinkle on the tomatoes and basil. Enjoy!
Vary It! Don’t be afraid to experiment with different vegetables. Throw in your leftover 
veggies and add or replace some of your favorites. There are no fixed rules regarding what 
you can add to your Veggie Frittata.

T Basil, Tomato, and 
	
Goat Cheese Egg Scramble
Want to liven up your scrambled eggs? Here’s a basic recipe that helps you do just that. 
The tomato and cheese also add a few more nutrients. Note: Goat cheese is a very 
strong cheese; a little of it goes a long way so you don’t end up with too many calories 
and fat. To round out this dish, try serving with whole-wheat toast.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 large eggs
6 large egg whites
1 large tomato, seeded and diced
1⁄4 cup coarsely crumbled soft fresh goat cheese
1⁄4 cup chopped green onions
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 teaspoons butter
2 shallots, chopped
	 1	Whisk the eggs and egg whites in a large bowl until well blended. Add the tomato (see 
Figure 16-3 for how to seed and dice a tomato), goat cheese, green onions, basil, salt, 
and pepper; whisk to blend.
	 2	Melt 1 teaspoon of the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the 
shallots and sauté for 3 minutes.
	 3	Melt the remaining 2 teaspoons of butter in the skillet and add the egg mixture; cook 2 
minutes without stirring.
	 4	Using a spatula or a large spoon, gently stir and turn over portions of the egg mixture 
until it’s cooked through but soft, about 4 minutes.
Vary It! If you prefer, you can sprinkle the goat cheese on top after the eggs are done 
cooking. The cheese will melt nicely over the eggs.

E
ating a healthy lunch may seem like a simple 
task, but lunch is one of those meals people 
often put little thought into. Why? Because grab­
bing something from a restaurant near the office 
or snacking all the way through the noon hour 
is easy. Don’t get me wrong. Occasional takeout 
or snack-based lunches are okay, but eating too 
many lunches this way can cause you to fall off 
track with your diet guidelines and end up seeing 
the same number each time you step on the scale.
The trick with following a low-glycemic diet is to 
be prepared for all of your meals — including lunch. This chapter shows you 
several quick and convenient lunch ideas so you can stay within your low-
glycemic diet plan and get the weight-loss results you’re looking for.
Preparing Healthy Lunches 
for the Week Ahead
Being prepared for your lunches at the beginning of the week can actually 
save you more time during your busy weekdays and help you stay on track 
with your weight-loss plan. After all, you can’t really follow your food goals 
unless you have the right foods around you. Also, everyone has those hectic 
mornings when trying to decide what’s for lunch six hours from now just 
doesn’t seem worth it. Having healthy, low-glycemic lunches that you’ve pre­
pared ahead of time can help out.

Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Although I’m a fan of preparing lunches for the week ahead of time, I’m not 
a believer in making tons of difficult recipes all day long. To be quite frank, 
unless you have loads of time, expecting you’ll make a full recipe for lunch 
and dinner every single day is somewhat silly. Heck, I’m sure there are weeks 
when you can barely find time to make two dinner recipes let alone seven 
lunch recipes and seven dinner recipes.
Life is very busy for most people. Making an actual recipe for lunch each day 
therefore isn’t that realistic. However, taking a Sunday and whipping up a 
couple easy recipes that produce a bulk amount of food is realistic. Sure, it 
may take you a little more time on Sunday, but you’ll love how quickly you 
can throw your lunch together during the week.
	
I’ve found that this make-ahead trick works best with salad-type sandwiches 
and casseroles, which leave you with food for the week (or at least part of the 
week).
There’s nothing better than opening up your refrigerator during the week to 
have your lunch ready to go. All you have to do is package it up! You’ll also 
be happy about the delicious lunches you get to eat as opposed to the ol’ 
last-minute peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The next sections present ideas 
for low-glycemic salad-based sandwiches and casseroles that can get you 
started on your make-ahead lunch adventure.
Sensational chicken and tuna salads
The sandwich is a staple for most lunches, but that doesn’t mean you have to 
eat the same boring one each and every day. One of my favorite routines is 
making a batch of chicken or tuna salad on Sundays to use during the week. 
Both salads are simpler to prepare than other recipes and incredibly versa­
tile, so you can change up your lunch each day.
	
You can use chicken or tuna salad to
	
✓	Make a basic sandwich
	
✓	Top off a big bowl of mixed greens
	
✓	Fill a tortilla or wrap
	
✓	Pair with a side salad or a bowl of soup
	
✓	Spread on top of some low-glycemic crackers with a side salad or a bowl 
of soup
Following are a few delicious (and easy!) low-glycemic chicken and tuna salad 
recipes for your cooking pleasure.

Lemon Chicken Salad
Chicken salad recipes are my favorites, and they never get boring. You can always have 
something new and fresh thanks to the many different ways of preparing chicken salad. 
This recipe is a great twist on a traditional chicken salad. It uses fresh lemon and spices 
to create a unique flavor.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3⁄4 cup finely chopped celery
1⁄4 cup lowfat mayonnaise
1⁄4 cup lowfat plain yogurt
1⁄4 cup finely chopped green onions
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
3 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 
cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes
1 green apple, cored and cut into 1-inch 
chunks
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
	 1	Mix the celery, mayonnaise, yogurt, green onions, tarragon, lemon juice, and lemon zest 
in a large bowl to blend.
	 2	Stir the 1⁄2-inch chicken cubes and 1-inch apple chunks into the mayonnaise mixture. 
Season with the salt and pepper.
Tip: Save time by using about 3 cups rotisserie chicken or 3 cups leftover grilled chicken in 
place of the chicken breasts.
Vary It! To add some variety to this tasty chicken salad, replace the green apple with 1 
cup dried cranberries or 1 cup halved grapes.

Curry Chicken Salad
Don’t let the curry fool you. This is a very light curry salad that isn’t as strong as some 
of the traditional curry recipes. It’s one of my favorites.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 teaspoons curry powder
1⁄4 cup lowfat mayonnaise
1⁄4 cup plain lowfat yogurt
2 teaspoons honey
1⁄2 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon orange juice
1⁄2 teaspoon orange zest
3 cups 1⁄2-inch pieces cooked boneless, 
skinless chicken breasts
1 cup halved seedless red grapes
1⁄2 cup thinly sliced green onions
1⁄3 cup walnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
	 1	Add the curry powder, mayonnaise, yogurt, honey, ginger, orange juice, and orange zest 
to a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk to blend.
	 2	Stir in the chicken, grapes, green onions, and walnuts. Season with the salt and pepper.
Tip: For speedier preparation, use 3 cups rotisserie chicken or 3 cups leftover grilled 
chicken.

Tuna Salad with Olives 
	
and Red Peppers
Tired of plain tuna? Well, those days are over thanks to this simple recipe. If you really 
want to take it to the next level, you can use fresh tuna (rather than canned) and lightly 
sear it. Delicious!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons lowfat mayonnaise
2 tablespoons lowfat plain yogurt
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
One 12-ounce can light tuna packed in olive 
oil, drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1⁄2 cup chopped and drained bottled roasted 
red peppers, or 1⁄2 cup chopped fresh red 
pepper
10 black olives, sliced
1 large celery rib, chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
	 1	Whisk together the mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard, and lemon juice in a large bowl.
	 2	Add the next six ingredients and stir together gently. Season with the salt and pepper.

Tasty timesaving casseroles
Casseroles are another timesaving make-ahead lunch option, especially if you 
prefer a hot lunch to cold salads or sandwiches. Casseroles often take a little 
more time to prepare, but they’re usually still quick and easy enough to put 
together on a Sunday as a way for your family to liven up its lunch menu. The 
best part is you get a whole lot of food for the week, as you can see from the 
following recipes.

226
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Storing your leftovers safely
When cooking meals to have on hand for the 
week, safe storage becomes a priority. Leaving 
foods, especially homemade chicken or tuna 
salads and casseroles, well past their due 
dates is all too easy. Case in point: My husband 
and I were spending time at the home of a rela­
tive who had to leave for a bit. She told us to 
make ourselves a sandwich, so we took out 
some turkey and cheese and ate. When she got 
home she had a blank stare and said, “Oh . . . 
you used that turkey.” Oops! Luckily we didn’t 
get sick, but we easily could have.
Protecting yourself and your family against 
food-borne illnesses is essential to a healthy 
kitchen. That’s why I’m sharing the following 
tips for safely storing food. (This way you don’t 
have to worry about someone grabbing a sci­
ence experiment from your refrigerator and 
thinking that the recipe naturally comes in that 
mossy green color.)
	✓	Keep your refrigerator in the “safe zone.” 
Cooling temperatures should be between 
34 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Within this 
temperature range, bacteria grow more 
slowly, so you can keep your perishable 
foods for a longer period of time. If your 
refrigerator doesn’t have a thermometer 
reading, you can easily buy a thermometer 
and periodically check that your tempera­
ture is in the right place.
	✓	Store your leftovers in covered contain­
ers. Although plastic wrap can do an okay 
job, sealed storage containers work better 
to prevent moisture loss in your food. They 
also keep the food from absorbing other 
odors so your leftovers stay tasty the 
second and third time around.
	✓	Avoid storing foods in decorative ceramic 
dishes or leaded crystal. Lead can leach 
out when acidic foods come into contact 
with the glaze or lead. Look on the bottom 
of the bowl to see whether it’s strictly for 
decorative rather than serving or storing 
purposes.
	✓	Store cooked foods quickly. I often cringe 
at potlucks when I see the potato salad sit­
ting in the sun for four hours. This is far too 
long a time for something like mayonnaise 
to sit out without being cooled somehow. 
Don’t leave your perishable foods at room 
temperature for longer than two hours.
	✓	Use your leftovers within three to four 
days. If you have a hard time remember­
ing when you first made a dish, label your 
container with the date that you cooked the 
meal. If you’re single or if there are just two 
of you in the household, you may want to 
freeze half of your leftovers if you can’t eat 
them all within three to four days.
	✓	Use the appropriate compartments in your 
refrigerator. Those different drawers really 
do have a special purpose. The meat bin is 
a little colder to keep your meats fresh for a 
longer period of time, and the crisper helps 
to retain moisture in your produce. Use ’em.

Mexican Casserole
Who doesn’t love a good Mexican casserole? They’re the best because they’re easy to 
whip up and you can be creative with them, throwing in your own personal touches as 
you see fit. Case in point: Most Mexican casserole recipes call for you to cook the chips 
mixed in. I prefer to serve them separately because they tend to get soggy, especially 
when you reheat the dish.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup chopped yellow onion
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces
1 pound shredded cooked chicken meat (from 
a small roasted chicken)
One 15 1⁄2-ounce can black beans, drained 
and rinsed
One 15 1⁄2-ounce can kidney beans, drained 
and rinsed
One 15 1⁄4-ounce can corn kernels, drained
2 cups salsa
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
1⁄2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
1⁄2 cup grated medium Cheddar cheese
11⁄2 cups baked tortilla chips
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 13-x-9-inch baking dish.
	 2	Heat the canola oil in a small skillet and sauté the onion and bell pepper until soft. 
Remove from the heat.
	 3	Combine the chicken, beans (both kinds), corn, salsa, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and 
pepper in a bowl. Add in the sautéed onion and bell pepper. Place half the mixture 
evenly in the baking dish.
	 4	Combine the Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses and sprinkle half over the mixture.
	 5	Cover with the remaining half of the chicken and bean mixture and sprinkle the remain­
ing cheese over the top.
	 6	Bake for 30 minutes and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with a handful of 
tortilla chips (you can crush them and mix them in or just scoop with them).

T Polenta Casserole with 	
	
Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella
Polenta is a very tasty low-glycemic grain made out of cornmeal, so it offers a sweet 
taste. This is a simple vegetarian casserole you can put together and have for the week. 
Enjoy it with a side salad for a light lunch.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Setting time: 2 hours
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some 
to prep the baking dish
1 medium onion, chopped
1⁄4 cup finely chopped carrots
1⁄2 cup chopped yellow or orange bell pepper
3 garlic cloves, minced
One 28-ounce can whole tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh basil
Salt to taste, plus 1 teaspoon
Ground black pepper to taste
4 cups water
1 cup corn grits polenta (or coarse cornmeal)
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese
	 1	Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and bell 
pepper. Cook until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.
	 2	Add the garlic to the saucepan and cook 1 additional minute. (If you’re unsure of how to 
peel and mince garlic, see Figure 17-1.) Then add the tomatoes and their juice (breaking 
up the tomatoes as you put them in), as well as the parsley and oregano. Bring to a 
simmer, reduce the heat, and cook uncovered for 15 minutes, until the sauce is reduced 
to about 3 cups. Mix in the fresh basil and season to taste with the salt and pepper.
	 3	In another large saucepan, bring the water to a boil and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Slowly 
whisk in the corn grits polenta (or coarse cornmeal). Reduce the heat to low and 
simmer, stirring often, until the polenta is thick and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
	 4	Lightly grease an 8-x-8-x-2 glass or ceramic baking dish with olive oil. Spread one-third 
of the sauce over the bottom of the dish. Pour half the polenta over the sauce and 
sprinkle with half the cheese.

229
 Chapter 17: Luscious Yet Easy Lunches
	 5	Pour another third of the sauce over the cheese and then pour the remaining half of the 
polenta over the sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and cover with the remain­
ing third of the sauce. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
	 6	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 7	Bake the casserole until it’s completely heated through, about 25 minutes. Let it cool 
for 10 minutes before serving.

Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Making Lower-Glycemic Lunches 
on a Weekday-to-Weekday Basis
If you have a little more time on your hands during the week, or if you don’t 
like the idea of preparing your lunches in advance, then you can make 
yummy lunches out of salads or even tacos and burritos. These dishes often 
require less cooking time and produce some very healthy, lower-glycemic 
meals. The sections that follow share some simple recipes to get you started.
Freezing casseroles and other leftovers
If you’re single or if you have a small family, 
you may find that casseroles make too much 
food to eat within three to four days. Freezing 
casseroles (and other leftovers) is a great way 
to avoid waste and to have your own prepack­
aged frozen meals for later use. Naturally, 
some foods don’t freeze well (such as fresh 
mushrooms and fresh tomatoes as well as 
overcooked pastas and milk-based sauces), 
but most cooked casseroles, stews, and soups 
do freeze well. Follow these tips to create your 
own homemade frozen meals:
	✓	Keep your freezer temperature in the safe 
zone of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or less. If your 
freezer compartment doesn’t stay that low, 
just know you’ll need to use up your frozen 
foods a bit quicker.
	✓	Package your leftovers so they’re air tight 
in plastic bags or freezer containers. If 
you’re planning on eating your leftovers in 
one sitting, then you can freeze the whole 
amount together. But if you want individual 
servings, then portion out your leftovers 
and wrap them individually. This is a great 
trick when you want to grab something for a 
quick lunch. Instead of reheating an entire 
half casserole, you have just one serving 
that’s ready to go. (Note: Whatever you do, 
don’t thaw a large amount because you 
expect to finish it in a day or two and then 
decide later to refreeze it. That isn’t good 
for the quality of your food.)
	✓	Label so you remember. Do you ever 
wonder whether some of the items in your 
freezer have been there for years? Avoid 
losing foods in your freezer compartment by 
grabbing some masking tape and a marker 
and writing down the date that you put the 
leftovers in the freezer. Doing so makes it 
easy to know how long the food has been 
in there so you can discard ancient entrees. 
You can also keep a log of what you have 
in the freezer along with the date it went in 
there. This way you can easily see what you 
have in the freezer without having to rum­
mage through the cold.
You should also know that even frozen foods 
have a limit on how long they’ll remain good. 
Here’s how long certain leftovers will last in 
your freezer:
	✓	Casseroles: Two months
	✓	Cooked meat dishes, soups, and stews: 
Two to three months
	✓	Cooked poultry and fish: Four to six months

Powerhouse salad entrees
Salads are a perfect choice for lunches, especially when you’re short on time. 
You can easily load them up with veggies and lean protein sources for a low-
glycemic, low-calorie, and highly nutritious meal. Even better, if you choose 
to use vegetables that have a high fiber content and then add some lean 
protein, you’ll feel full for a longer period of time (perhaps shocking from a 
salad, huh?). Salads also take a little longer to eat, which in turn helps you 
slow down during your meal. Put all that together, and you realize that salads 
are (generally) superb for successful weight loss.
	
Not all salads are healthy. Watch out for what and how much of an ingredi­
ent you’re putting on your salad. Regularly adding too much meat, cheese, or 
salad dressing (or all three!) to your salads can hinder your weight-loss goals.
Following are a few trusty salad recipes I turn to often. They’re so good that I 
bet they wind up on your go-to list as well.
	
T Mixed Greens with Walnuts, 
	
Pears, and Goat Cheese
This is one of my absolute favorite salad recipes, and I use it all the time. I love the com­
bination of walnuts, pears, and goat cheese. This is one recipe you can make for a light 
meal or add as a side with some soup or an entree. If you want a heartier salad, just add 
some grilled chicken slices.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons honey mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
One 5-ounce bag mixed baby greens
1 large fresh pear, cored and cut into 1-inch 
chunks
One 4-ounce container crumbled goat cheese
1⁄3 cup toasted walnuts
	 1	Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a small bowl and set aside.
	 2	Combine the mixed greens and pear chunks. Toss with enough of the dressing to coat 
everything evenly.
	 3	Top the salad with the goat cheese and toasted walnuts. Serve.
Vary It! For a little extra flavor, top this salad with slices from one avocado.

Grilled Chicken Spinach Salad
One of the simplest lunchtime salad ideas, this recipe incorporates grilled chicken. 
Chicken cooks faster when you grill it than when you bake it, so this recipe is an option 
when you have a little extra time during the day. When you don’t have the time for grill­
ing, simply use leftover grilled chicken.
Specialty tool: Gas or charcoal grill, or grill pan
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
One 5-ounce package baby spinach leaves
1 pound tomatoes (preferably heirloom) in 
assorted colors, cut into wedges
One 9-ounce container teardrop tomatoes 
(also called pear tomatoes)
1⁄2 cup halved and pitted Kalamata olives
1⁄4 cup feta cheese
	 1	Heat the grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
	 2	Whisk together the olive oil, oregano, and vinegar in a medium-sized bowl. Pour out 1⁄4 
cup for basting the chicken.
	 3	Lightly brush the chicken with the dressing you just made. Add the salt and pepper to 
taste and cook the chicken on the grill until it’s fully cooked through, about 7 minutes 
per side. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it cool.
	 4	While the chicken cools, combine the spinach, tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese in a 
large bowl. Toss with enough of the dressing to coat evenly (you may not need to use 
all of it). Season with the salt and pepper.
	 5	Cut the grilled chicken into thin 1⁄2-inch-thick strips. Top the salad with the grilled 
chicken strips and serve.

Spinach Salad with Chicken, 
	
Oranges, and Toasted Almonds
Spinach is packed with nutrients, including vitamins K, A, C, and E, as well as folate and 
iron. It’s a powerhouse of a vegetable that makes for a heartier salad than regular let­
tuce. Coupled with oranges, almonds, and lean poultry (you can use either leftover 
grilled chicken or sautéed chicken), this recipe packs a powerful health punch and 
serves as a very satisfying lunch. (Note: If you want to make this recipe just for yourself 
and enjoy it over the course of a few days, prepare all the ingredients but store them 
separately. That way you can easily and literally throw this salad together when you’re 
ready for it!)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons orange juice
3 tablespoons canola oil
8 ounces fresh baby spinach
11⁄2 cups fresh orange segments, cut into 
chunks (or 11⁄2 cups canned mandarin oranges)
2 cups cooked, cubed chicken
1⁄4 cup dried cranberries
1⁄4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
	 1	Whisk the vinegar, orange juice, and canola oil in a small bowl and set aside.
	 2	Mix together the spinach, orange segments (or mandarin oranges), chicken, cranber­
ries, and almonds. Toss with enough of the dressing to coat all the ingredients evenly.
	 3	Divide onto 6 plates and serve.

Speedy south-of-the-border options
Tacos and burritos are ideal for quick, healthy low-glycemic lunches. 
Tortillas, specifically the whole wheat and corn varieties, are lower-glycemic, 
making them a better choice than higher-glycemic breads. You can load tor­
tillas up with healthy foods for a satisfying lunch, like in the two recipes that 
follow.
	
The Mexican dishes you cook at home are far different than what you receive 
in a Mexican restaurant. You ultimately take in far more calories and fat at the 
restaurant. Making Mexican favorites at home helps you to enjoy the Mexican 
food you’re craving while keeping it off of your thighs.
Don’t like spinach? You may be a supertaster
Do spinach and asparagus taste pungent and 
bitter to you? Ever wonder how in the world 
sane people enjoy these foods? Well, you just 
may be a supertaster. People experience taste 
differently depending on the number of fungi­
form papillae on their tongues — also known as 
those little red bumps you see on your tongue. 
People with a lot of papillae have a very strong 
sense of taste (in other words, they’re super­
tasters!); people with the average amount of 
papillae enjoy the flavors of all kinds of foods; 
and people with fewer papillae don’t notice 
much difference in flavors.
Your child’s number of papillae may explain 
why he’s a picky eater. Kids have more papil­
lae than adults, so their taste buds are hyper 
sensitive. Giving them some time and reintro­
ducing foods as they get older is a good way 
to expand their diet choices. They may begin 
to enjoy foods such as spinach and asparagus 
more as their taste sensitivity declines with age.
If you suspect you’re a supertaster, don’t 
fret. You can replace spinach in salads with 
milder lettuces, such as mixed baby greens or 
romaine. Don’t feel that you have to abandon a 
recipe completely. You can always find some 
simple replacements.

White Bean and Chicken Chili
My family and friends love this recipe (and so do I!). It’s simple to prepare, boasts a lot

Quick Chicken Tacos

prepare.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings (2 tacos per serving)
Getting to know and love quinoa
Although you may not see quinoa stored in the 
pantry right next to the rice in most homes, it’s 
growing in popularity due to its great health 
benefits and wonderful taste and texture. One 
of the greatest benefits of this little grain is the 
fact that it’s a complete protein source that 
contains all nine essential amino acids, just 
like meat and eggs. Few plant-based products 
can boast this fact, making quinoa great for a 
vegetarian meal. Quinoa is also low-glycemic, 
as well as high in fiber and minerals.
You can find quinoa near the grains in most 
local supermarkets. It’s as easy to cook as 
rice (see Chapter 15 for basic instructions) and 
offers a rich, nutty flavor. Give it a try! You may 
find you enjoy it better than your traditional rice, 
potatoes, and pasta.
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 
1-inch pieces
1 to 2 tablespoons taco seasoning
1 tablespoon canola oil
8 whole-wheat flour or corn tortillas
1 orange or yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
One 4-ounce can sliced black olives
1 avocado, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded Cheddar Monterey Jack cheese
	 1	Place the cut-up chicken pieces in a bowl. Add the taco seasoning (1 to 2 tablespoons, 
depending on your taste) to the chicken and mix until every chicken piece is coated.
	 2	Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoning-coated 
chicken pieces and cook thoroughly (about 5 minutes).
	 3	Grab a tortilla and layer on the chicken pieces, bell pepper, tomatoes, olives, and avo­
cado. Sprinkle with the cheese and roll.
	 4	Repeat the layering and rolling for the other 7 tacos, and you’re ready to go!
Tip: Sweet tomatoes, such as Romas, work quite well in this recipe.

Grilled Chicken and 
	
Vegetable Skewers
Grilling is one of the great perks of the spring and summer seasons. I for one have never 
enjoyed how tough chicken becomes when grilled, but this recipe saves the day with its 
great marinade, which makes the chicken moist and flavorful. This recipe also brings 
lots of colorful veggies into your meal.
Specialty tools: 8 to 10 skewers, soaked in water for 1 hour; gas or charcoal grill, 
or grill pan
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Refrigeration time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 teaspoon sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
12 medium-large shiitake and/or portobello 
mushrooms (cut the portobellos into 1-inch 
pieces)
12 cherry tomatoes
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 zucchini, cut into 1-inch chunks
	 1	Combine the olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper to make the 
marinade. Mix well and separate into two long plastic or glass containers with lids.
	 2	Place the chicken in one container and the vegetables in the other. Close the lids and 
shake the containers until your chicken and veggies are well coated with the marinade. 
Place the containers in the refrigerator anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
	 3	Skewer the vegetables and chicken in whichever order you prefer.
	 4	Place the skewers on the grill and cook thoroughly, about 10 minutes. (The chicken 
should be cooked through, and the veggies should be soft and browned.)
Tip: Skewering the chicken and vegetables is a messy task. Have some napkins handy!
Vary It! To make this a vegetarian recipe, substitute 8 ounces of extra-firm tofu for the 
chicken. After skewering, cook until both the veggies and tofu are browned and soft.

Vegetable, Barley, and Turkey Soup
Vegetables and pearl barley are healthy, low-glycemic foods — they also go great in this 
soup! Soups can make a fabulous, filling meal, especially on those colder days of the 
year. This soup is almost like a stew; it’ll definitely keep you satisfied. It’s also a great 
way to use leftover turkey. Serve Vegetable, Barley, and Turkey Soup with a side salad 
for a complete meal.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 cups chopped onions
2 celery stalks, chopped
4 large carrots, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
4 cups canned vegetable broth
One 28-ounce can Italian-style chopped 
tomatoes, with their juices
3 cups water
One 10-ounce package frozen corn kernels
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
1⁄3 cup dried lentils
1⁄3 cup pearl barley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
2 cups diced cooked turkey
	 1	In a large saucepan, heat the canola oil on medium-high heat.
	 2	Add the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic, and sauté until soft.
	 3	Add the remainder of the ingredients except for the turkey and bring everything to a 
boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until all the vegetables and lentils are soft, 
about 40 minutes.
	 4	Add the turkey and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes; serve.
Tip: To further enhance the flavor of this soup, sprinkle in a bit of dried basil or oregano.

Beef, the Low-Glycemic Way
Beef has been a little taboo in the dieting and health world because of its 
higher fat content. Although many cuts of beef are high in fat as well as satu­
rated fat, some cuts are relatively low in fat. The problem with these cuts is 

243
 Chapter 18: Delicious Dinner Recipes
that they aren’t always the juiciest due to their lower fat content. So although 
recommending these leaner cuts is easy from a health perspective, they may 
not be what you typically expect out of beef. Yet with a little creativity, you 
can prepare a lean beef dish that tastes fabulous.
	
Here are a few simple ways to enhance the flavor and tenderness of lean beef:
	
✓	Marinades: Soaking meats adds flavor and softens meat tissues. 
Marinades consist of three parts: an acidic source (usually vinegar, 
citrus juice, or wine), oil (typically olive oil), and seasonings (take your 
pick of the many different herbs and spices out there).
	
✓	Pounding: Pounding beef with a meat mallet breaks the meat’s fibers 
and connective tissues, making lean cuts tenderer.
	
✓	Powders: Tenderizing powders contain enzymes that help break down 
fibers in the beef.
	
✓	Rubs: Rubbing raw beef with a mix of dry herbs and spices and letting 
the rub permeate overnight can tenderize the meat while adding a spark 
of taste. Some common rub ingredients include ground black pepper, 
ground cumin, chili powder, crushed red pepper, celery seed, garlic

Most beef has a much higher fat content than poultry, but a few cuts work 
out to be pretty lean — in many cases even leaner than dark-meat chicken.

The trick to enjoying beef the low-glycemic way is to make sure you eat only 3 
ounces of meat and load the rest of your plate up with veggies. Doing so keeps 
your calorie level low.

Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
The recipes that follow show you how to prepare a couple different beef 
dishes the low-glycemic way.
	
Beef Fajitas
Beef fajitas are a good, lean substitute for the ol’ steak. They offer a great source of pro­
tein and can be loaded with colorful veggies. If you use a whole-wheat tortilla, they also 
make for a lower-glycemic meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Refrigeration time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings (2 fajitas per serving)
1⁄4 cup lime juice
1⁄2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1 garlic clove, minced
1 pound boneless top sirloin, cut into 1-inch 
strips
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 orange or yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 onion, sliced
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
8 corn or whole-wheat tortillas
Salsa, for serving
	 1	Mix together the lime juice, coriander, chili powder, and garlic in a small bowl. Pour 
over the meat as a marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
	 2	After the meat has marinated, add the sliced peppers and onion to it.
	 3	Heat the olive oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Stir-fry the meat and vegeta­
bles until the beef is cooked, about 5 minutes.
	 4	Warm the tortillas in the microwave for 10 seconds.
	 5	Fill each tortilla with the fajita mixture and serve with salsa.

Grilled Garlic-Lime Tenderloin
Tenderloin isn’t the leanest cut o’ beef out there, but it certainly isn’t the richest either. 
This beef dish pairs wonderfully with a large mixed greens salad or green beans.
Specialty tool: Gas or charcoal grill, or grill pan
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Refrigeration time: 24 hours
Cooking time: 22 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
4 large garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons dried ginger
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1⁄3 cup fresh lime juice
1⁄3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
11⁄2 pounds beef tenderloin, well trimmed
	 1	In a large container, mix all the ingredients, minus the beef, until well blended.
	 2	Add the beef tenderloin to the mixture and coat both sides with the marinade.
	 3	Refrigerate and marinate for 8 hours. Turn the tenderloin over once while it’s 
marinating.
	 4	After it has marinated, let the tenderloin stand at room temperature for about 30 min­
utes. Then remove it from the marinade, pat it dry, and grill it to desired doneness 
(about 22 minutes for medium rare).

Fabulous Seafood Recipes
Seafood isn’t just a lean protein source — it’s also the best way to get in your 
omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are beneficial for heart health and your 
mood; they also work as a powerful anti-inflammatory. The big problem is 
many people don’t get enough omega-3s in their diet. Although no recom­
mended daily allowance for fats currently exists, an acceptable daily intake is 
about 1.1 grams a day for women and 1.6 grams a day for men.
If you enjoy seafood, you don’t have to worry too much about taking supple­
ments or adding other omega-3-rich foods to your diet. Table 18-2 shows a 
breakdown of how much omega-3 is found in some popular seafood choices.

Is my fish safe from mercury and other contaminants?
Fish is an important part of a healthy diet. It’s 
low in calories and an excellent source of 
protein and omega-3 fatty acids. However, 
some fresh fish may have high levels of mer­
cury, which can cause health problems when 
consumed in large doses. Because mercury 
is a neurotoxin, it can damage the brain and 
nervous system. Developing brains (those of 
fetuses and young children) are most suscep­
tible to mercury toxicity. Following are some 
tips to help you enjoy fish as part of a healthy 
diet while simultaneously reducing your risk of 
consuming too much mercury.

Grilled Pesto Salmon
This recipe is as easy as it gets — it has only three ingredients! Grilled Pesto Salmon 
is a fantastic dish for a summer night when you don’t have a lot of time to cook. It’s 
truly “healthy fast food.” (Note: The cooking time really depends on how thick your fish 
is. Check it to make sure it isn’t overcooked.) Serve this dish with your favorite low-
glycemic brown rice, pearl barley, or quinoa recipe and/or a good helping of veggies.
Specialty tools: Aluminum foil; gas or charcoal grill, or grill pan
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound wild salmon
2 to 3 ounces store-bought pesto
1⁄4 cup sun-dried tomatoes (dried and soaked 
in water), lightly chopped
	 1	Rinse the salmon and pat it dry with paper towels. Place the skin side down on alumi­
num foil, making sure the foil is big enough to cover the fish when you’re done.
	 2	Evenly spread the pesto over the fish in a thin layer.
	 3	Sprinkle the sun-dried tomatoes over the top.
	 4	Fold up the aluminum foil to cover the fish. Grill over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes

Baked Halibut with Quinoa, 
	
Spinach, and Cherry Tomatoes
This dish has all the components of a well-rounded, lower-glycemic meal with fish, veg­
etables, and quinoa. This is also a great example of adding color to your meal — beauty 
with taste. Enjoy this dish with a side salad or fruit for even more color.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
Two 4-ounce halibut fillets
1⁄2 cup uncooked quinoa
1 cup chicken broth
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 cups (packed) baby spinach
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
	 1	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
	 2	Whisk 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and lemon juice in a small bowl; season the dressing 
with the salt and pepper.
	 3	Place the halibut on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the fish with the salt and pepper 
to taste and drizzle with half of the dressing. Bake the halibut until it’s just opaque in 
the center, about 12 minutes.
	 4	Meanwhile, cook the quinoa in a large saucepan with the chicken broth until it’s tender 
but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Set aside.
	 5	In a separate large skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, along with the garlic; 
sauté over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the spinach and cook for 1 minute until it starts 
to wilt. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute. Stir in the cooked quinoa; stir to coat.
	 6	Season the mixturewith the salt and pepper and remove it from the heat. Cover and let 
stand for 1 minute to finish wilting the spinach.
	 7	Divide the quinoa and vegetable mixture between 2 plates. Top with the halibut and 
remaining dressing and serve.
Vary It! Can’t find halibut? Use two 4-ounce fillets of fresh salmon instead.

The great fish debate: Wild versus farmed
There’s quite a buzz in today’s society about 
which type of fish is better: wild or farmed. 
Most fish and nutrition experts agree that wild 
should be the preferred fish for cooking into a 
tasty dish for a few reasons:
	✓	Contamination: Studies show that farmed 
fish have higher levels of contaminants 
such as PCBs (that’s short for polychlori­
nated biphenyl, in case you were wonder­
ing). The Environmental Defense Fund has 
issued a health advisory due to the high 
levels of contaminants.
	✓	Omega-3s: Even though farmed fish are typi­
cally “fattier,” they possess less of the ben­
eficial omega-3s due to the diet they’re fed. 
Wild fish (especially salmon) have a more 
vibrant color and a higher omega-3 content.
	✓	Environmental concerns: Farmed fish pose 
some growing environmental concerns that 
you just don’t have with wild fish. In particu­
lar, environmentalists are worried about all 
the waste from fish farms that’s just getting 
dumped into the oceans and the amount of 
food required to grow these fish.
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon dried ginger
1 garlic clove, minced
1⁄4 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
16 uncooked jumbo shrimp, peeled and 
deveined
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice (about 
11⁄4 cups uncooked)
1⁄3 cup mango, chopped
1⁄3 cup pineapple, chopped
3 green onions, thinly sliced
	 1	For the shrimp: Whisk 1 tablespoon of the canola oil, 1⁄2 teaspoon of the ginger, plus the 
garlic and crushed red pepper, in a medium-sized bowl. Add the shrimp, toss, and let sit 
in the marinade, covered, for 2 hours in the refrigerator.

251
 Chapter 18: Delicious Dinner Recipes
	 2	For the rice: Whisk the remaining tablespoon of canola oil and 1⁄2 teaspoon of ginger, 
plus the lime juice and soy sauce, in another bowl. Add the cooked rice, mango (see 
Figure 18-1 for tips on cutting a mango), pineapple, and onions; toss well. Cover the rice 
and mango salad and let stand at room temperature.
	 3	Heat the grill to medium-high heat. Thread 4 shrimp onto each of the 4 skewers. Grill 
the shrimp until they’re just opaque in the center, about 2 minutes per side.
	 4	Mound the rice and mango salad in the center of the plate, top with the grilled shrimp 
skewers, and serve.
Tip: Steaming your brown rice in a rice steamer rather than boiling it gives the rice a lower 
glycemic load.

T Barley Risotto with 
	
Asparagus and Toasted Almonds
If you haven’t used pearl barley other than in soups and stews, you may be surprised to 
discover that it makes a great substitute for rice in risotto. It has a naturally creamy tex­
ture that makes it a perfect fit. Serve this dish with a side salad.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 bundles asparagus (about 11⁄2 pounds), trimmed
1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
11⁄4 teaspoons fresh orange zest
5 1⁄2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves
11⁄4 cups pearl barley
1⁄2 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup toasted, slivered almonds
1 ounce finely grated parmesan cheese (optional)
	 1	Cut the asparagus tips diagonally into 1⁄2-inch-thick slices and put aside. Next, coarsely 
chop the remainder of the asparagus stalks.
	 2	Place two-thirds of the stalk pieces, as well as the pepper, orange zest, 1 cup of the vegeta­
ble broth, and 1 cup of the water, in a blender. Puree until relatively smooth and set aside.
	 3	Add the remainder of the asparagus stalks and tips to boiling water until they’re cooked 
crisp, about 1 minute. Drain and run cold water over them; set aside.
	 4	Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and 
garlic and sauté until tender, about 6 minutes. Add the barley and stir for 1 minute.
	 5	Add the wine and boil, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute.
	 6	Add 4 cups of the vegetable broth, cover, and bring to a boil. Next, reduce the heat and 
simmer, covered, until the barley is tender (it should be chewy) and the mixture has 
thickened to a stewlike consistency, about 35 to 40 minutes.
	 7	After the barley is cooked, stir in the asparagus purée, asparagus-tip mixture, and 
enough of the remaining 1⁄2 cup of broth to thin the risotto to your desired consistency. 
Cook over moderate heat, stirring, until hot, about 1 minute.
	 8	Top with the almonds and parmesan cheese (if desired).
Tip: To easily trim asparagus, snap off the tough ends of the stalk (near the bottom).
Vary It! If you can’t find any low-sodium vegetable broth, simply use a mix of half regular 
vegetable broth and half water.

effective weight loss

S
nacking can be a great weight-loss strategy, 
but it can also be a weight-loss saboteur. 
Whether snacking helps or harms your weight-
loss efforts all depends on how you approach it. Unfortunately, you can 
easily fall into the trap of eating too much or eating the wrong kinds of foods 
that wind up adding more calories to your day. Not being prepared to snack 
wisely can also mean grabbing whatever you’re able to find, which in many 
cases is a high-glycemic or high-calorie food. Carefully choosing healthy low-
glycemic snacks is the key to successful weight loss, and I help you figure out 
how to do that in this chapter with the assistance of some delicious recipes 
and healthy-snacking ideas.
When it comes to sweet treats, the good news is a low-glycemic diet is flex­
ible enough that you can enjoy them — in moderation. Moderation is the key 
because desserts are typically extra calories. Limit your portion sizes and try 
to eat desserts slowly, really savoring each bite. When you do, you’ll be sur­
prised how small a taste of a sweet treat can actually satisfy you. Also, make 
an effort to choose lower-glycemic dessert options. There are more than 
you think, and they’re quite tasty. I share a few examples of delicious, lower-
glycemic desserts in this chapter.

Introducing Snacking Saboteurs
Snacking is one of the biggest challenges people face with weight loss. You 
may find yourself grazing throughout the day because of time, or you may 
discover that you tend to wait too long to eat, which can affect your metabo­
lism. Finding the right snacking balance will help you stick to your low-
glycemic guidelines and reach your weight-loss goals.
In the following sections, I delve into the details of the two primary snacking 
saboteurs and give you ways to combat them.
The negative effect of mindless grazing
Grazing is a typically mindless way of snacking, meaning you don’t know how 
many crackers you just ate and you probably aren’t paying too much attention 
to the calorie count of the large mocha and scone you just grabbed at the local 
coffee shop. The result of mindless grazing? Much higher calorie levels than 
you can possibly imagine. Those calories add up without you even realizing it, 
because you feel like you’re eating very little throughout the day.
I put myself to the test many years ago when I worked in a long-term care 
facility. Family members routinely brought in donuts, cookies, and chocolate 
candies for the staff. These treats would linger on the countertop so every­
one could take some during the workday. I partook, but I really thought I 
didn’t eat that much. After all, I was the dietitian, and I wanted to be a good 
example of balancing these types of snacks. To see just how much I con­
sumed while grazing, I decided to jot down each thing I grazed on during the 
workday. A piece of candy here, a half a donut there. When I added up the 
numbers at the end of the day, I realized I’d consumed a whopping 850 calo­
ries! That’s a lot for mindless picking. Even I didn’t realize how much I was 
eating because I only grabbed little bits and pieces throughout an eight-hour 
workday.
	
I’m sure you too have occasionally found yourself picking on food items 
throughout the day without being mindful of the amount and kinds of foods 
you’re choosing. But do you really understand why that happens? Following 
are a few reasons why people find themselves in grazing patterns, as well as 
ways to avoid falling into the mindless grazing trap:
	
✓	Feeling like there’s not enough time in the day: People are busier these 
days than ever. Grabbing whatever’s around therefore seems much 
easier than taking the time to choose a nutritious snack. However, snack­
ing healthfully is actually quite easy if you make eating a priority. Crazy, 
I know. But if you don’t make your meals and snacks a priority in your 

257
 Chapter 19: Healthy (And Yummy) Snacks and Desserts
life, you’ll completely lose focus of your weight-loss goals. Prioritizing 
healthy eating doesn’t have to mean huge amounts of time or effort, just 
a little forethought. The payoff is totally worth it: If your body is properly 
nourished, you can tackle your busy day with gusto! (I offer some tasty 
low-glycemic snack ideas in the later “Planning Out Healthy Snacks: A Top 
Weight-Loss Strategy” section.)
	
✓	Eating because of emotions or stress: This is a big culprit for many 
people. You may find yourself reaching for a soda and a quick snack 
from the vending machine many times during a stressful day. Awareness 
is the key to emotional eating. Keeping records of your food intake and 
emotions doesn’t take much time but is valuable in becoming aware of 
and overcoming your old habits and emotional-eating triggers. Turn to 
Chapter 13 for additional advice on defeating emotional eating.
	
✓	Wanting to keep junk food out for the kids: Although the occasional 
treat is nice, leaving junk food such as chips and cookies on your coun­
tertop is a big trap. It’s so easy to grab a cookie here and a few chips 
there. Before you know it, that mindless grazing has added up to a whole 
day’s worth of calories. Keep your countertops clear of junk food and 
put out a bowl of fruit instead. You’ll be amazed how your family will eat 
better choices when that’s all you give them, and you won’t be tempted 
by “just a bite” here and there.
The problem with waiting too long to eat
Waiting too long to eat a meal or a snack is the exact opposite behavior of 
mindless grazing (see the preceding section). Going five to seven hours with­
out eating anything can negatively affect your metabolism (the rate at which 
your body burns calories). As you discover in Chapter 8, your body recog­
nizes when it’s out of fresh sources for energy (read: meals and snacks), so it 
begins to slow down the rate at which it uses calories to compensate for this 
lack of energy — that’s the exact opposite of what you want to happen for 
weight loss!
When you wait too long to eat, you typically wind up eating way too much 
whenever you do finally sit down to a meal. What’s wrong with that? Well, 
you’re consuming more calories on a slower metabolism. If that scenario is 
the norm for you, losing weight is going to be pretty difficult.
	
The point of all this is simple: You really do need to eat to lose weight. 
Planning out your meals and snacks (and taking the time to eat what you 
planned) are steps on the road to weight-loss success.

258
Part IV: Cooking and Eating the Low-Glycemic Way 
Planning Out Healthy Snacks: 
A Top Weight-Loss Strategy
Planning out healthy snacks is a solution to mindless grazing and waiting too 
long to eat. You may read this advice as a simple suggestion you’ve seen before, 
but it’s a very important strategy and means the difference between staying 
stuck at a weight you don’t like and seeing the results you’re looking for.
	
Carefully choosing your snacks will help you stick with your low-glycemic plan 
and save you hundreds of calories.
Wondering how to go about picking healthy, low-glycemic snacks? Start by 
thinking about your average busy, stressful workday. You know you’ll be 
working late, and although you’re able to grab some lunch and dinner at the 
local takeout restaurant, you haven’t planned any of your snacks for the day. 
Your boss keeps a bowl of Peanut M&M’s on the counter, and there’s a vend­
ing machine down the hallway. Throughout the day you pick on the M&M’s, 
grab a large latte from the coffee stand, and munch on a small bag of potato 
chips from the vending machine.
That doesn’t sound like much for an eight- to ten-hour day, but you’ve actu­
ally just consumed 948 calories in snacks. Not only that, but the potato chips 
are higher-glycemic, leaving you with a blood sugar spike and stimulating 
your appetite for more food. And thanks to the restaurant takeout, you’re 
looking at substantially more calories for your entire day.
Are you eating too much at snack time?
Eating too much during snack time can cause 
you to consume excess calories throughout the 
day, but how do you know how much to eat? 
Other than portion sizes, the most important 
tool at your disposal is your body’s fullness and 
hunger cues. (Believe it or not, your body has 
other levels than just really hungry and really 
full.)
As an experiment, wait about three to four 
hours after a meal and write down what your 
hunger level is at that time. Are you extremely 
hungry (1), moderately hungry (2 to 4), or neutral 
(5)? Eat a small snack, wait for about 20 min­
utes, and record how full you feel at that time. 
Are you still hungry? Are you feeling neutral or 
perhaps slightly full? Getting used to these dif­
ferent levels of hunger and fullness is a great 
weight-loss strategy that can help you control 
calories in an effective way.
Think about your hunger on a scale of 1 to 10, 
with 1 being “starving,” 5 being neutral, and 10 
being “stuffed to the gills.” Many people get 
used to feeling very full after a meal and snacks. 
However, a snack’s job is to tide you over until 
your next meal . . . not necessarily to make 
you feel completely full. A good rule of thumb 
is to eat something small and allow yourself to 
feel neutral or just comfortably full. If you feel 
stuffed to the gills after a snack, you probably 
ate too much.

With a mindful, planned snack, you can change this scenario. Substitute a 
small coffee, an ounce of nuts with an apple, and a yogurt for the Peanut 
M&M’s, large latte, and bag of chips. These simple, preplanned swaps bring 
your snack total down to just 380 calories, and the choice of low-glycemic 
foods helps you feel more satisfied.
	
You have many low-glycemic snack options to choose from, whether you want 
to find something quick or make something at home. Here are some healthy 
grab-and-go snack ideas that take either no or little time to prepare:
	
✓	8-ounce lowfat yogurt, fruity or plain
	
✓	1 ounce of nuts with a piece of fruit (such as an apple or orange)
	
✓	1 ounce of trail mix with dried fruit
	
✓	Mozzarella cheese stick with a piece of fruit
	
✓	1 ounce of peanut butter spread on two celery sticks
	
✓	1 ounce of peanut butter spread on one small sliced apple or half of a 
banana
	
✓	1⁄3 cup lowfat cottage cheese with fruit	
	
✓	2 tablespoons of hummus with sliced bell peppers and carrot sticks for 
dipping (you can buy premade hummus at the grocery store, or you can 
use the Traditional Hummus recipe found later in this chapter)
	
✓	2 tablespoons of hummus spread on half of a whole-wheat pita
	
✓	2 cups of lowfat air-popped popcorn
	
✓	10 baked corn tortilla chips with black bean dip (either store-bought 
or my Yummiest, Ugliest Black Bean Dip recipe, found later in this 
chapter)
Making Low-Glycemic Snacks at Home: 
Recipes for Success
Although store-bought snacks are handy to have on hand, you can actually 
prepare many tasty recipes in the comfort of your home. I’m a big fan of 
having fresh snack foods on hand. The following recipes are some great ones 
to make for your family or to bring with you for munching at work.

T Yummiest, Ugliest Black Bean Dip
Don’t let the color of this recipe scare you. Even though this black bean dip turns out a 
strange gray color, it tastes fantastic. Great for the family, you may not want to serve 
this dip at a party without warning your guests about the color (unless maybe you’re 
hosting a Halloween party).

T Grilled Zucchini Mini Pizzas
Veggies are great snack foods, and you can prepare them in a variety of ways. This 
recipe is quick and easy to fix, and it gives you a twist on just eating raw veggie sticks.
Specialty tool: Gas or charcoal grill, or grill pan
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 small zucchini
Seasoning salt to taste
4 ounces parmesan cheese
1⁄4 cup black olives, sliced

Choosing and Preparing Lower-Glycemic 
Treats and Desserts
Most people like eating sweets, especially after dinner. This behavior is actu­
ally a ritual for some folks, something they’ve been conditioned to do since 
a young age. However, most treats and desserts equal high sugar, high fat, 
a high glycemic load, and high calories, contributing to the consumption of 
excess calories, erratic food-craving cycles, and emotional eating.
	
You can enjoy treats and desserts on a low-glycemic diet as long as you bal­
ance them appropriately. Moderation is essential. Pay attention to your sweet 
tooth and make sure you’re indulging in the higher-glycemic, higher-calorie 
treats (think cakes and cookies) only on special occasions such as birthdays, 
parties, or holidays.

263
 Chapter 19: Healthy (And Yummy) Snacks and Desserts
	
If you have a sweet tooth like me, then you want to find desserts that will work 
for you on a weekly basis. Following are a few ideas for treats that are low-
glycemic and not terribly high in calories and fat:
	
✓	1⁄2 cup frozen yogurt
	
✓	1⁄2 cup lowfat pudding
	
✓	1⁄2 cup lowfat chocolate pudding with fresh strawberries
	
✓	1 ounce of dark chocolate
	
✓	8-ounce fruit smoothie
	
✓	Baked apple slices
	
✓	Banana split made with vanilla frozen yogurt
	
✓	Frozen-Fruit Smoothie Pops (see the following recipe)
	
T Frozen-Fruit Smoothie Pops
Frozen-Fruit Smoothie Pops allow you to enjoy a cold treat on a hot day without all the 
excess sugar. Your kids will love ’em too!
Specialty tools: Four to six 6-ounce paper cups; 4 to 6 Popsicle sticks
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Freezer time: 30 to 45 minutes followed by 12 to 24 hours
Yield: 4 to 6 servings (depending on how much fruit smoothie is prepared)
Fruit smoothie of choice, such as the one in Chapter 16
	 1	Prepare the fruit smoothie as directed.
	 2	Pour the smoothie into the paper cups, place the cups on a small cookie sheet, and put 
them in the freezer for 30 to 45 minutes.
	 3	Remove the cups from the freezer and carefully place a Popsicle stick in the center of 
each cup. Return the cups to the freezer and freeze overnight, or for 24 hours.
	 4	Peel the paper off the frozen pops and enjoy.
Warning: Make sure you use paper cups. If you use plastic ones, your Frozen-Fruit 
Smoothie Pops will stick to the cups.

T Crustless Pumpkin Pie
Pumpkin pie is one of those classic fall comfort foods. It’s also likely one of the pies 
with the lowest calorie count and lowest glycemic load you’ll ever find. You can make 
pumpkin pie even better for you (and for your weight-loss goals) by simply omitting the 
crust for a sweet treat without all the calories and high-glycemic ingredients.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1 can vegetable cooking spray
One 16-ounce can pumpkin
1⁄2 cup egg whites (about 4)
1⁄2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
One 12-ounce can evaporated skim milk
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	Lightly spray a 9-inch glass pie pan with vegetable cooking spray. Mix all the ingredi­
ents in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Pour the mixture into the pie pan and bake until a 
knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
	 3	Allow the pie to cool before slicing into 8 wedges or storing in the refrigerator.

ollowing a low-glycemic diet isn’t really “going on a 
diet” — it’s making a genuine lifestyle change. 
Discover how to make lasting change for you and your 
family by focusing on the positive, avoiding dwelling on 
the negatives, and working together to make small 
changes that, over time, add up into a new, healthier 
lifestyle.
Exercise goes hand in hand with a low-glycemic lifestyle, 
and it’s a big part of overall health and weight loss as well. 
Exercise strengthens the heart and cardiovascular sys­
tem, and it’s one of the best ways to reduce your stress 
level. Incorporating regular exercise into your life will 
help you feel great and lose weight. (In fact, research 
shows that you not only lose more weight when you 
change your eating habits and exercise regularly but that 
you also keep the weight off longer.)
Adopting a lower-glycemic way of eating has an added 
benefit besides weight loss: It’s an effective way to 
improve your overall health. Choosing lower-glycemic 
foods can help decrease your blood pressure, cholesterol, 
and blood sugar levels. Plus, the disease-fighting antioxi­
dants and phytochemicals naturally found in many low-
glycemic foods boost your immune system.

C
reating true lifestyle changes is an internal process that takes time, 
practice, and commitment. This is the one area that can be more chal­
lenging than you may have ever thought. Although you may be able to follow 
some new dietary and exercise guidelines for a short time, doing so gives you 
purely short-term results, which is one big reason why so many people lose 
weight only to gain it back again.
The trick to losing weight and keeping it off is to embrace lifestyle changes 
that get you focused on practicing new behaviors until they become lifelong 
habits. To stick with a lifestyle change, you have to really want to make the 
change, which means you must accept that the positive side of, say, walking 
three days a week before work outweighs the negative aspects (like getting 
up 40 minutes earlier than you’re used to). Of course, you can’t forget about 
the external factors. Any new lifestyle change needs to work realistically 
within all aspects of your life, from work and errand running to family and 
friends. Clearly making such long-term changes can get complicated, but it’s 
far from impossible. In this chapter, you explore what it means to make life­
style changes and how to achieve those changes for yourself.
Making Lifestyle Changes Rather 
Than Going on a Diet
I can’t tell you the exact number of people who go on diets each year or the 
exact number of people who fall off the dieting wagon. What I can tell you is 
why they fall.

270
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
The majority of people tend to get stuck in the “on again, off again” mentality 
of dieting. This mentality is often a result of trying to follow something rig­
idly, be it a strict menu plan or calorie counting. Real weight-loss success is 
found by taking weight loss one step at a time and developing habits you can 
live with that support your new goal weight. In other words, losing weight for 
good requires a commitment to making lifestyle changes.
In the sections that follow, I describe the true differences between lifestyle 
changes and diets, present the pitfalls of on-again/off-again diet plans, and 
reveal a simple strategy for making lifestyle changes so you can start off on 
the right path.
Knowing the difference between 
lifestyle changes and dieting
Have you noticed that lifestyle change is the hot new phrase these days? 
You see it in magazines, on television, and in the materials for popular diets. 
Plastering this phrase on products and touting it over the airwaves is a great 
marketing tactic because science shows that long-term weight loss is the 
result of healthy lifestyle changes. However, just because a diet program uses 
this phrase doesn’t mean following the diet is equal to making a change in 
your overall lifestyle. Diet programs that provide you with menus you have 
to follow strictly often call themselves “lifestyle change programs” when in 
fact they’re the traditional model of a diet that has been used for the last 50 
years. These diet programs haven’t really changed; they’ve just added the 
phrase lifestyle change to their marketing materials.
	
The small percentage of people who’ve maintained weight loss over a several-
year period have made true lifestyle changes. That’s the key to success, not 
adherence to fad diets. However, the phrase lifestyle change has gotten so 
muddy lately that determining whether you’re really creating lifestyle changes 
has become difficult. Following is a breakdown of what distinguishes true life­
style changes from diets:
	
✓	Lifestyle changes aren’t temporary. If you follow a precise low-glycemic 
plan, stop for a month, go back to your old habits, and then start up 
again, you’re not really making changes to your lifestyle. No, you don’t 
have to be perfect in your efforts to follow a low-glycemic plan (that’s 
impossible to do for long), but you do have to make the best choices 
from what you’ve picked up about your body and meal planning — each 
and every day.
	
✓	Lifestyle changes are all about balance. Discovering balance is the key 
to making long-term changes work. Without balance, you can wind up 
feeling deprived and defeated, or even overwhelmed with the need to be 
perfect. Know that there’ll be times when flexibility is the name of the 
game and allow yourself to indulge without losing your focus.

271
 Chapter 20: From Goals to Habits: Making True Lifestyle Changes
	
✓	Lifestyle changes become a natural part of your routine. In the begin­
ning, trying to lose weight requires some focus as you find ways to 
incorporate low-glycemic foods and cut back on the amount of overall 
calories you consume. Yet eventually the new actions you’re taking 
(such as diet changes and exercise) turn into a habit.
	
	The most effective way to create a habit is to set goals and take action 
toward those goals over and over until that action feels like a normal part 
of your routine. Focus on the areas of your diet and exercise that can use 
some tuning up, decide what you’re going to change, and then make that 
change each day. (Note: You may need to switch up your strategies once 
in a while if your current path isn’t working well in your lifestyle.)
	
✓	Lifestyle changes must be things you can do on your own. Following 
someone else’s plan is only a temporary fix. Working as a registered 
dietitian in the weight-loss industry, I’ve never met someone capable of 
following a strict meal plan long term. Doing so would be truly difficult 
due to the loss of personal preference and choice. Figuring out how to 
plan healthy meals on your own is the more realistic option. When you 
know how to plan your meals, you can plan healthy eating anytime, any­
where, whether you’re on vacation or at the office.
Understanding the downfalls of being 
on and off a diet plan
A lot of times people approach weight loss looking for an easy out. They want 
to be told what to eat so they can go home and just follow the plan. This 
approach is easy, but it’s practically guaranteed to send your weight on a 
roller coaster ride as you yo-yo on and off the plan.
When you religiously follow a diet plan, you lose weight and get results. I’m 
not denying that, and I’m sure you’ve experienced this scenario one time 
or another. However, you probably also know that when you veer from the 
plan, you usually wind up going right back to your old habits. Depending on 
how long you’re off the plan, you can regain all that weight you lost when 
you were on the plan. I promise you this cycle will never feel natural; instead, 
you’ll always feel like you’re dieting. Who wants to be on a diet for the rest of 
her life? That doesn’t sound fun in the slightest.
	
Following are some of the downfalls of treating your dietary changes as on-
again/off-again behaviors rather than permanent habits:
	
✓	The dietary changes become temporary, and you always feel like you’re 
dieting, not like you’re living a normal life.
	
✓	The results you see are only temporary. Your weight can rise and fall 
each time you go on and off the plan.

272
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	
✓	Because you’re not making healthy behaviors a habit, they’re harder to 
keep up.
Consider this example: Both Laurie and Beth are using a low-glycemic diet 
to manage their weight and health. Laurie is sticking strictly to her new 
diet plan and paying close attention to the foods she shouldn’t have. One 
Saturday she’s invited to a barbeque at a friend’s house. There, she has the 
option of eating hamburgers, chicken, potato salad, macaroni salad, mixed 
greens salad, and chips. Laurie’s craving all the high-glycemic foods and 
thinks, “I’ve been good for a month, so I’ll eat high-glycemic foods today and 
get back on track tomorrow.” So she goes for the hamburger, potato salad, 
macaroni salad, and chips; winds up overdoing the high-glycemic foods; and 
feels guilty on Sunday. She then says to herself, “Well, I blew it yesterday. I’ll 
just get back on track starting Monday.”
Beth, on the other hand, is using a more balanced, moderate approach. She 
too goes to the barbeque and knows she can eat what she really wants, but 
she isn’t having terrible cravings from deprivation. Beth decides to balance 
her meal by eating the chicken, mixed greens salad, and potato salad (even 
though it’s high-glycemic, that potato salad just looks too good to pass up). 
The next day, Beth has no guilt because she ate in moderation and continues 
to follow a balanced diet.
You can see how Laurie’s approach feels temporary, which leads her to feel 
guilty about her choices and revert to her old eating habits. In contrast, 
Beth’s approach feels like she’s making natural choices based on both her 
new guidelines and what she really wants to eat. No cause for guilt there.
	
A balanced approach is the difference between making true lifestyle changes 
and following a diet. Yes, the diet will get you results — possibly even faster 
than if you were to work toward real lifestyle change — but those results will 
be achieved at the risk of never really finding long-term weight loss. After 
healthy behaviors are a part of your day-to-day life, they’re much easier to 
follow — and you get the motivating benefit of long-term results.
Focusing on what you can eat, 
not what you can’t
Research has shown that when a person is told not to eat something she 
tends to fixate on it, have more cravings, and wind up binging on that food 
item. Focusing on what you can eat rather than what you can’t eat is an 
important strategy in successfully making lifestyle changes. It’s part of the 
mental game you need to play to stay on track.
When you hear the word diet, what comes to mind for you? Maybe you think 
of following a strict plan or of all the foods you aren’t able to eat. So many 

273
 Chapter 20: From Goals to Habits: Making True Lifestyle Changes
weight-loss and health goals center on what you can’t have. Limit fat, avoid 
trans fat, steer clear of high-glycemic foods . . . the list goes on.
	
If you have a lot of dieting in your past, your mind probably automatically 
focuses on what you can’t eat rather than what you can. This mindset sets you 
up for a feeling of deprivation before you’ve even started. Deprivation can set 
off a pattern of being out of control with the foods you’re supposed to limit. 
You may say to yourself, “Well, I was already bad today so I may as well eat 
all high-glycemic, high-calorie foods and get back on track next week.” This 
all-or-nothing attitude is all too common, but you can defeat it by turning your 
thought process around. Why not try telling yourself that no foods are off-
limits? How freeing is that? When you shift your thoughts from strict dieting 
to balancing your choices, you realize that you can have high-glycemic foods. 
The difference is how often you eat them.
	
Another great mental shift is to look at all the low-glycemic foods that you love 
and focus on them. Thinking to yourself “I can eat all the whole-wheat bread, 
cantaloupe, watermelon, and nuts I want” is more productive than thinking 
“Well, if I can’t eat white rice, white pasta, or sugary cereal, what in the world 
am I going to eat?!” Focusing on foods that you not only enjoy but can also 
have regularly helps you forget about any feelings of deprivation.
Strategies for Stepping into Change
Making lifestyle changes (or any changes really) isn’t something that hap­
pens overnight. It’s a bit-by-bit process that requires you to practice and 
repeat new behaviors until they become part of your normal routine, just like 
brushing your teeth. Like anything in life, sometimes you’ll face challenges 
and experience setbacks. That’s okay. How you handle those situations is 
what determines your future success in maintaining your new way of life.
In the following sections, I share some strategies that make the change pro­
cess a little smoother. With this information in mind, you’ll be better pre­
pared to deal with challenges when they sneak up on you.
	
When approaching any part of your life in which you want to change your 
habits, always give yourself the space and support necessary so you can 
reach your goals.
Looking for the positives
Finding the positives in your situation is the first step to making long-term 
changes and a solid way to build support for your goals. Putting your focus 
on all the benefits of your chosen lifestyle changes helps you stick to those 
changes because it’s natural to want to do something that feels great.

274
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	
The biggest problem with dietary changes is that most people don’t inherently 
dislike the way they eat — they just hate that their chosen foods are causing 
them to gain weight or have health issues. When they realize that they have to 
change the foods they eat to see results, they tend to get caught up in negative 
thoughts such as “I can’t eat pasta ever again” or “I’m going to have troubles 
eating out.” Letting your mind go to these negative places is easy, but it’s not 
helpful to your long-term goals.
To conquer negativity surrounding lifestyle changes, start thinking about all 
the benefits of your new plan. Doing so not only helps you feel better about 
your choices but also gives you the motivation you need to make real life­
style changes you can live with for the long haul. The benefits work as long-
term motivators that you can bring out when you need them the most.
	
Following a low-glycemic diet has many benefits for you to focus on. Here are 
just a few to get you started:
	
✓	Weight loss: You probably bought this book because you want to lose 
weight. Eating a low-glycemic diet can help you do that. It can also help 
you maintain weight loss long term so you can be free from the dieting 
roller coaster. If that’s not a major motivator, I don’t know what is.
	
✓	Improved energy: The low-glycemic plan I encourage throughout this 
book provides your body with more energy-boosting foods so you can 
feel great during the day rather than rundown.
	
✓	Disease prevention: A low-glycemic lifestyle helps decrease your risk of 
chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer by incorpo­
rating more fruits, vegetables, and fiber into your diet.
	
✓	Feeling better all around: Okay, okay, this one’s a little vague, but it 
really is true that when you eat healthy foods most of the time, you just 
feel better. I once had a 24-year-old male client who was doing great with 
his new diet changes. He then went on a small vacation with his buddies 
and ate hamburgers and burritos for one day. In just that one day he felt 
so bad (low energy, bogged down) that he simply thought “I just can’t 
eat like this anymore.” Like my client, feeling better overall can be a 
great motivator for long-term change.
Committing to a new approach
Although embracing your new dietary habits may be easy, giving up your old 
ones often isn’t. That’s what makes commitment such an important part of 
the change process — it’s another tool for building support for your chosen 
way of life. One of the biggest reasons I see people struggle with making life­
style changes is that they try to follow both their new and old habits, and 
sometimes the two just don’t mesh.

275
 Chapter 20: From Goals to Habits: Making True Lifestyle Changes
For example, one client of mine did absolutely great following her low-
glycemic diet guidelines in a balanced way. In addition, her meal planning 
became habitual, and her exercise was consistent. However, she still gave 
in to her “vice” — eating cookies in front of the television with her husband. 
Having some cookies once in a while is no biggie and certainly works within a 
moderate nutrition plan, but my client and her husband shared a package of 
cookies five or more nights a week. This old habit interfered with my client’s 
progress, and because she wasn’t seeing the type of results she wanted, she 
wound up feeling frustrated.
	
Committing to a new way of life means really letting go of those things (foods, 
activities, and so on) that aren’t serving you anymore, no matter how much 
you may enjoy them. Commitment also comes into play when you face life 
challenges that get in the way of your goals. When you’re committed to a goal, 
you find solutions that work for you; when you aren’t committed, you go back 
to your old habits.
I like to use a visual example of going for a walk to a waterfall. Imagine that 
along the way a tree falls into your path. You can either find a way around it 
to achieve your goal of seeing the waterfall, or you can turn around and go 
home. All obstacles and challenges work this way. You have a choice: Stay 
committed and conquer the obstacle in your path or just give up.
	
To help you stay committed to your lifestyle changes, try this exercise: Grab 
a pen and a sheet of paper. On one side of the paper, write down all the new 
changes you want to make; on the other side, write down the things you may 
need to let go of in order to really live your new lifestyle. Sometimes just being 
conscious of where you’re going and what you have to give up along the way 
can solidify your commitment to your goals.
When my client and I spoke about her “cookie time,” she was able to declare 
her commitment and find solutions to her issue. She and her husband came 
up with a list of better treats they could eat during television hours. This 
solution was a direct result of my client’s commitment to her new, healthier 
lifestyle.
Dealing with setbacks
Changing your lifestyle is a process, and setbacks are a natural part of that 
process. Dietary habits are some of the hardest habits to change, so don’t 
get discouraged if you slip up now and again as you figure out how to really 
incorporate your chosen changes into your day-to-day life. (In other words, 

276
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
give yourself some much-needed space!) Reading up on your new low-glycemic 
diet and how to plan meals is just the first step. The next step is making your 
low-glycemic diet work in your life, a process that naturally requires some 
trial and error.
	
Instead of letting setbacks get you down, use them as an opportunity to dis­
cover how you’re going to make this particular challenge work within your 
new lifestyle. Here are some steps to take when you’re faced with setbacks:
	
1.	Write down the life event leading to the setback.
	
	 This life event can take many forms — vacations, holidays, family, work 
stress, or even boredom.
	
2.	Write down how this event affected your new diet and exercise habits.
	
	 As a result of the event, did you not have time to squeeze in exercise 
or plan your meals? Was all of your focus pointed elsewhere due to the 
event? How long and to what degree did this life event make you fall off 
track?
	
3.	Think about ways you can work around this obstacle in the future.
	
	 If a vacation sent you for a tailspin, maybe on your next vacation you 
can balance your food choices and take advantage of fun exercise. If 
a life crisis hindered your efforts at change by leaving you unable to 
focus on anything but the situation, that’s okay and entirely understand­
able. Just be mindful of how long you’re off track and don’t let that time 
extend more than a few days, if at all possible.
	
4.	Ask yourself how quickly you can get back on track.
	
	 This is probably the most important step in dealing with setbacks. The 
quicker you can find a solution and get back on track, the less that set­
back will interfere with your progress.
To see these steps in action, pretend a major upheaval has occurred at work 
and you’re the point person. You have people coming at you from all direc­
tions. Because you’re constantly tied up in the office, you may find yourself 
eating pizza and burritos that the staff has picked up for you. Even though 
this situation may not be a long-term one, it’s still a setback to your goal of 
following a low-glycemic diet. To get back on track in this scenario, you could 
tell the staff to pick up a fajita for you rather than a burrito, or you could 
pack up some low-glycemic frozen foods that you can pop in the microwave.
	
If you’re unable to work around a particular setback and you get caught back 
up in your old habits, don’t get angry with yourself. Instead, focus on getting 
back on track as soon as you can. That’s the most important step in recover­
ing from a setback. A few days of reverting to your old habits won’t hurt you 
as much as a few weeks or months. Don’t let guilt get the better of you and 
make you feel defeated.

Determining your personal stage of readiness
James O. Prochaska and his colleagues at 
the University of Rhode Island discovered that 
there are various stages of readiness for devel­
oping any kind of lifestyle change. According to 
their transtheoretical model (a model of behav­
ior change that has been the basis for devel­
oping effective interventions to promote health 
behavior change), every person goes through 
each stage at one time or another when cre­
ating any kind of change in his or her life, and 
each stage is equally important.
To figure out which stage of readiness you’re in 
right now and to discover some steps you can 
take during that stage, pick one of the following 
italicized statements that best describes you.
Others (friends, family, doctors) want me to 
lose weight or make changes to my diet, but it 
isn’t that important to me.
You’re in the precontemplation stage. You 
may not have any interest in making lifestyle 
changes at this time, but consider exploring 
why your friends and family have concerns 
about your health. Plan a time to get some 
feedback from a close friend or relative who 
can give you objective information about why 
she’s concerned. When you’re in this stage, 
ask yourself the following questions: Why do 
others want me to make changes? How will I 
know when it’s the right time for me to make 
changes toward weight loss and better health?
I want to lose weight, but my life is too busy 
right now to think about diet and exercise. I 
just don’t have time to think about it.
You’re in the contemplation stage. You may 
be considering the possibility that you want to 
make changes but feel you can’t right at this 
time. Stay proactive during this stage by con­
tinuing to absorb information about weight loss 
and nutrition. Ask yourself the following ques­
tions: What kind of information and support will 
I need to start making changes to lose weight? 
What are the risks and benefits of making life­
style changes?
I’ve taken steps such as buying a weight-
loss book and/or joining a gym, but I haven’t 
started yet.
You’re in the preparation stage. You’re pre­
paring to take action in the near future. You’re 
ready to see all the options available so you 
can take the right steps toward change. When 
you’re in this stage, ask yourself the following 
questions: What kind of support do I need to 
step into action? What types of obstacles are 
getting in my way?
I’ve recently started taking some sort of action 
toward change such as walking, going to the 
gym, or changing my food choices.
You’re in the action stage. The action stage is a 
very fragile one. You need a great support team 
to help you through it. Make sure your family 
and friends are onboard with your weight-loss 
goals so they can provide you with support and 
motivation. Ask yourself the following ques­
tions: What do I need in place to keep up my 
new changes? What types of things motivate 
me now?
I’ve recently incorporated new behaviors into 
my lifestyle yet occasionally I may have some 
setbacks.
You’re in the maintenance stage. You’ve made 
some permanent lifestyle changes that have 
already resulted in weight loss. You may feel 
from time to time that you’re experiencing 
some setbacks. Just remember that setbacks 
are normal and will happen occasionally. When 
they occur, take some time to figure out what 
has gotten in the way of your efforts to be con­
sistent. Then ask yourself the following ques­
tions: What types of life events have led up to 
my setbacks? How can I make different choices 
in the future to keep me on track? What type of 
support do I need right now?

Making Change a Family Affair
If you have a family, trust me when I say that incorporating a low-glycemic 
diet into your life is far easier when you get your spouse and/or children 
involved. Getting good meals on the table is difficult enough. The last thing 
you need is your spouse and kids all wanting separate meals. That’s a recipe 
for disaster that makes it much harder for you to successfully change your 
lifestyle.
Fortunately, the low-glycemic diet isn’t drastic, which means your family mem­
bers won’t feel like they’re on a “diet.” In the sections that follow, I offer some 
advice for making your low-glycemic lifestyle something everyone in your 
family can support and follow — sometimes without them even realizing it!
Transitioning your family to a 
low-glycemic lifestyle
Lifestyle changes, such as following a low-glycemic diet, don’t affect just you; 
they affect your whole family. You may think “I don’t want my family to have 
to make lifestyle changes just because I have to,” but that’s the wrong men­
tality. Think of your new low-glycemic diet as a way of life that involves mod­
eration instead. A dietary plan that’s moderate rather than strict is easier to 
incorporate into your family’s life. In some cases, no one even notices the 
changes.
Case in point: As part of her new lifestyle, one of my clients cleaned up 
her countertops by getting rid of the cookies and chips that were lingering 
around and setting out a big bowl of fruit in their place. She said to herself, 
“This will never work. My kids are going to be screaming at me for the cook­
ies.” Instead, to her delight, her kids came home from school, picked through 
the fruit bowl, and didn’t say a word about the lack of cookies.
	
Here are some tips for making your family’s transition to a low-glycemic life­
style go a little more smoothly:
	
✓	Remember that moderation is key. Your family members will most 
certainly resist your efforts at getting them to eat healthier if you force 
them to follow a strict diet.
	
✓	Find low-glycemic snack foods that everyone enjoys. Exchanging is 
always a better philosophy than eliminating, especially with kids. So 
instead of stockpiling cookies and potato chips, purchase yogurts, 
baked tortilla chips, or even popcorn and offer these lower-glycemic 
foods to your spouse and kids instead.

279
 Chapter 20: From Goals to Habits: Making True Lifestyle Changes
	
✓	Allow high-glycemic foods once in a while, but don’t keep them in the 
cupboards every day. This suggestion is a win-win for everyone. You 
won’t be tempted as often to wander back to your old habits, and your 
family members won’t miss out on their high-glycemic favorites. This is 
a great strategy to put in place when you’re grilling (buy some potato 
chips as a side) and when you’re eating out (let the kids order their 
favorites).
	
✓	Don’t make a big fuss about following a low-glycemic diet. You may 
be excited about it, but to your family, a deluge of info about the low-
glycemic diet will make them feel like they’re following a diet and not 
just living their lives eating healthy foods. Stick to making healthy choices 
instead of pointing out everything in the cupboard or refrigerator that’s 
low-glycemic.
	
✓	Allow your family to have a voice and be willing to find compromises. 
In my experience, families adjust quite well to the eating modifications 
that come with a low-glycemic diet, but every family is different. Hear 
what your family members have to say, and when they have issues, try 
to find solutions that work for everyone.
Talking with your spouse
If you’re married and your spouse has no interest in making changes to his 
or her diet and lifestyle, then your efforts at making a lifestyle change likely 
won’t last long because you’ll be scrambling trying to buy and prepare 
separate foods. I encourage you to sit down with your spouse and explain 
the basics of the low-glycemic lifestyle. Then work together to find a way to 
embrace that lifestyle in your household.
	
Following are descriptions of two common spouse-related challenges to living 
a low-glycemic lifestyle, along with strategies for overcoming them:
	
✓	Your spouse brings home high-glycemic treats and/or wants to keep 
all the high-glycemic foods around. I promise your spouse isn’t trying 
to purposefully sabotage you. He or she just doesn’t realize or under­
stand how difficult it is for you to have high-glycemic foods around. 
Let your spouse know why having high-glycemic foods in the house is 
tough for you and try to compromise on some other foods that aren’t 
as tempting for you but that your spouse still enjoys. I had one client 
who couldn’t resist the Oreo cookies that her husband loved but could 
do without peanut butter cookies, which were also among his favorites. 
This simple swap worked for her family.
	
✓	Your spouse doesn’t like many of the low-glycemic meals you’re 
making. This challenge is a particularly tough one because you don’t 
want to wind up preparing several different meals. Go over the 

280
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
low-glycemic food list with your spouse (you can even use Appendix A 
to get you started) and get a good understanding of what he or she likes 
and dislikes. Then find some quick ways to handle the situation without 
having to cook too much. My husband isn’t a fan of brown rice (a lower-
glycemic food). He prefers white rice (a high-glycemic food). Instead of 
forcing him to eat brown rice or setting myself back by eating white rice, 
I buy bags of precooked, frozen brown rice and white rice from the gro­
cery store and just microwave the two different bags. It’s easy for me, 
and we’re both happy with our meal in the end.
	
When you engage in a little open conversation with your spouse, you can 
usually come up with solutions to challenges that make a low-glycemic diet 
a better fit in both of your lives. Sure, it may take a little trial and error, but 
you’ll soon find a groove that works well for your family.
Developing healthy habits for your kids
Your kids develop their eating habits early on from you. When you set them 
up for making healthy choices at a young age, they won’t have as many 
weight-loss and health struggles when they’re older. Teaching your kids to 
eat a variety of foods that include the right balance of the healthy stuff and 
treats sets them up for success with
	
✓	Childhood health
	
✓	A healthy weight for their lifespan
	
✓	Disease prevention
	
✓	Better concentration in school
	
✓	Improved problem-solving abilities in school
	
✓	Enhanced endurance and energy for activities and sports
	
✓	Lifelong healthy habits
	
Although having an open conversation with your spouse about the food 
changes you’re making is great, don’t overdo the low-glycemic diet talk with 
your kids. You can certainly educate them on healthy food choices, but the 
more you focus on diet lingo, the more resistance you’re bound to encounter 
as your kids start to feel like they’re following a special diet.
	
A great strategy for getting your kids to embrace a low-glycemic diet is to ask 
them what kinds of fruits and vegetables they like. Doing so helps them feel 
like they’re part of the meal-planning process (or at least the grocery-shopping 
process). Also, almost all fruits and vegetables are low-glycemic, so you’re 
giving your kids the freedom to choose their favorites while making sure 
everyone’s sticking to the new low-glycemic lifestyle.

281
 Chapter 20: From Goals to Habits: Making True Lifestyle Changes
Avoid eliminating foods your kids are used to — unless of course you’re 
willing to deal with potential temper tantrums (even all the way up to high-
school age). A better approach with kids of any age is to come up with some 
healthier, low-glycemic options they may enjoy so you can make a child-
approved swap.
	
Don’t forget moderation when it comes to the higher-glycemic foods and 
treats your children enjoy. Finding that perfect balance will make your new 
lifestyle changes go over smoothly and help your kids develop healthy habits 
for a lifetime.
Tips for getting your kids to eat healthier foods
Parents really can help their kids eat better — 
whether they’re following a low-glycemic diet 
or not — and the process doesn’t have to be 
unpleasant. In fact, it can actually be a blast for 
you and your kids. Following are some tips for 
increasing your children’s interest in healthy 
foods in a fun way:
	✓	Bring your kids grocery shopping occa­
sionally. I know this idea may sound like a 
nightmare, but it can be beneficial at times. 
While you’re in the produce section, let 
your kids pick out a new fruit or vegetable 
to try. Kids are more interested in trying 
new foods when they get to pick them out.
	✓	Prepare meals together. Let your children 
be a part of the meal-preparation process. 
Whether they mix something in a bowl or 
pour a sauce, they’ll be happier to eat and 
more willing to try a meal when they played 
a part in making it.
	✓	Incorporate “fun foods.” Kids are drawn to 
foods that have different shapes and bright 
colors. Many fruits, including kiwi and star 
fruit, fall into this category. If you have a 
creative side, let it loose! Instead of hand­
ing your child a whole orange, break it up 
into pieces and make a smiley face on the 
plate. You’ll be amazed what some simple 
creativity can do.
	✓	Make desserts healthy. Believe it or not, 
you can have dessert and make it healthy 
too. Instead of depending on store-bought 
cookies and candy (which provide minimal 
nutrients), try serving fresh strawberries 
dipped in chocolate sauce, a fruit smoothie, 
or a berry cobbler. These lower-glycemic 
choices may have some sugar, but they 
also contain nutrients. Everything is healthy 
in moderation.
	✓	Allow candy occasionally and in modera­
tion. Candy should be a once-in-a-while 
treat, not a go-to snack. When your child 
really wants candy, forgo giving her a whole 
candy bar and try sprinkling a few M&M’s 
in 1 ounce of trail mix instead. Also, avoid 
using candy and other sweets as rewards 
for good behavior; playtime in the park and 
fun family outings are better, more active 
reward alternatives.
Remember: Be a role model for your children. If 
you eat healthy and engage in physical activity 
you enjoy, your children will likely do the same. 
Encouraging physical activity and healthy food 
choices during childhood helps build these 
habits for a lifetime.

Incorporating Exercise 
into Your Life
In This Chapter
▶	Delving into the benefits of exercise for both mind and body
▶	Devising your “perfect fit” exercise plan
▶	Discovering low-glycemic eating strategies to improve your workout
I
t’s really not possible to get through any type of book on weight loss with­
out covering exercise. I know, I know. You’ve probably heard it all before, 
so instead of telling you that you need to incorporate exercise to lose weight, 
I’m going to focus this chapter on some benefits of exercise and how to make 
exercise work in your life long term.
Believe it or not, one of the biggest reasons exercise is so important for 
weight loss is so you can eat a normal amount of food! Exercise not only 
burns calories but also helps improve your metabolic rate. So instead of suf­
fering through a 1,200-calorie diet that leaves you starving all day, you can 
eat 1,500 calories (or more!) and still lose weight.
If you’re like me, the thought of joining a gym may not sound too appealing. 
Most weight-loss programs prescribe gym-type exercises, which is great if 
you enjoy them, but if you don’t, you’ll notice your StairMaster begins to be a 
place where you sort your laundry. Exercise and movement can be enjoyable. 
You just have to find the right fit for you — which may not involve any fancy 
gym equipment whatsoever.
In order to find that “perfect fit” exercise program, you really need to be 
motivated to start the process. Looking at the benefits of exercise and all 
the ways it can help your life may be just the place to start to help you feel 
excited about it.

This chapter covers the various benefits you can derive from regular exer­
cise. You then discover how to set up an effective exercise program that 
works for you and that you can stick to regularly. Finally, you find out how 
and when to fuel your body to boost your exercise efforts even more.
Exploring the Many Benefits of Exercise
Even though it may be the first purpose you can think of, exercise is so much 
more than simply a way to burn calories. It’s good for increasing your energy, 
reducing your stress, improving your mood — the list goes on. Often when 
you really connect with the health benefits of exercising, you become more 
motivated to do it regularly. Then the pounds just shed away naturally!
In the following sections, I share some of the benefits of exercise that not 
only help with weight loss but also improve your health and your overall 
sense of well-being.
Your natural body shape — revealed
For most people, the number on the scale is the most important aspect 
of weight loss. Exercise obviously helps get that number down. However, 
people have become so focused on numbers that they forget to simply be 
happy with the changes in their body shape. A scale is one indicator that 
gives you a concrete measurement, but the shape of your body is another.
When you exercise, you start to build more lean body mass while decreasing 
body fat. Your natural shape is the result. You begin to look more trim and 
shapely as this shift happens — even if you don’t really need to lose weight.
	
A pound of muscle and a pound of fat weigh the same — 1 pound. However, a 
pound of muscle takes up a quarter of the space that fat does. So even if you 
don’t see drastic number changes on the scale, pay attention to your body 
shape and how you look and feel in your clothes. That’s more important than 
a single number on a scale. By switching your focus from numbers to body 
shape, you may find that you feel better with your progress.
	
If you’re really into measuring, take a measuring tape and measure your waist, 
arms, and thighs. Most people find that they lose inches faster than the scale 
changes numbers. Monitoring your inches in addition to your pounds can help 
reinforce that you really are making progress.

 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
Increased energy
Do you ever catch yourself saying you wish there were more hours in the 
day? Well, I can’t make that happen, but I can tell you how to have more 
energy during the day to do all that you need to and feel great. The secret 
doesn’t lie in the latest energy drink. It’s found in exercise. Just lace up your 
tennis shoes and go for a walk to find that spark of energy you’re looking for.
Research shows that exercise helps to improve energy, even among people 
with chronic illnesses that increase fatigue. As a matter of fact, more than 90 
percent of studies show that people who live a sedentary lifestyle improve 
their energy markedly when they start an exercise program compared to 
those who don’t.
Wondering how exerting more energy can make you have more energy? Well, 
the best answer is that your body and heart become stronger and more effi­
cient with exercise. That translates into improved energy in the long run (not 
to mention weight loss and body shaping).
Perhaps you’ve tried an exercise program for a few days only to come home 
exhausted. That’s expected, especially if you were fairly sedentary before 
that. It may also be a sign that you’re trying to do too much too soon. Give 
yourself at least a week to get beyond this initial start-up hump, and you’ll 
soon feel more energized throughout the day.
	
Finding the time to exercise requires personal motivation. To help keep you 
motivated, maintain a log of your exercise and rate your energy level on a 
scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being low and 10 being high). Then you can monitor 
how your energy level progresses as you incorporate more movement into 
your life.
Squeezing exercise into your mornings
Many people find that the only time they can 
exercise is in the morning, meaning they have 
to address that dreaded question: How can 
I possibly get up any earlier? Many of my cli­
ents have faced this issue head-on and found 
that they actually have more energy when they 
wake up early and exercise. Yes, the first few 
days (even weeks) can be difficult because 
your body isn’t used to waking up 30 to 60 
minutes earlier. But your body can get used 
to early rising just like it can get used to any 
other change. Before you realize it, you’re in a 
comfortable routine of getting up first thing for 
a little cardio and a little strength training. What 
a great way to start the day! You can then walk 
confidently through the day, knowing that you 
already checked this important habit off of your 
to-do list.

An improved mood
Exercise can greatly affect your overall mood. This fact may not sound like a 
big deal, but if you’re an emotional eater, exercising may hold the key to pre­
venting you from polishing off that pint of ice cream because you feel sad or 
depressed.
Exercise improves mood because it releases a cocktail of feel-good chemi­
cals. No, I’m not talking about a cocktail you get at the local bar. I’m talking 
about the brain chemicals adrenaline, dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin 
that are released during exercise. All of these chemicals work together to 
make you feel good, calm, and relaxed. Ever hear of a “runner’s high”? This 
term comes from the endorphin release some runners experience after a 
good run. You can achieve a similar experience with other forms of exercise, 
such as a good hike or swim.
	
Research shows that exercise is even helpful in cases of mild depression. With 
all the ups and downs of your day, you may find that a little exercise goes a 
long way toward improving your overall happiness (and waistline!).
A lower risk of developing chronic diseases
	
One of the most important benefits of regular exercise is a decrease in your 
risk for developing chronic diseases. I’m sure most people have heard this 
message before, yet there are still so many individuals out there who don’t get 
enough exercise. If you or a family member have a history of heart disease, 
high blood pressure, or diabetes, I can’t stress how important and beneficial 
it is to exercise regularly if you want to prevent these types of diseases from 
rearing their ugly heads.
Following are a few ways in which exercise can help you stay healthy and 
decrease your risk of developing certain diseases:
	
✓	Heart disease: The only warning signs you have for a heart attack are 
your lab work, blood pressure, and family history. It can happen anytime, 
anywhere. If you have any heart disease risk factors, you can decrease 
that risk significantly with regular activity. Cardiovascular exercise 
reduces the risk of heart attack, especially in people who have known cor­
onary artery disease. Specific benefits of cardiovascular exercise include 
a stronger heart muscle, less chance of angina, reduced plaque buildup in 
the arteries, improved blood pressure, and better weight.
	
✓	Diabetes: Exercise improves the sensitivity of insulin so that more blood 
glucose can enter the cells, ultimately providing better blood glucose 
control. Couple that with a low-glycemic diet, and you have a powerful 
duo to help control your blood sugar. Both aerobic and strength training 
help with diabetes.

287
 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
	
✓	High blood pressure: Moderate exercise makes an impact on your over­
all blood circulation. It causes the heart muscle to pump better, which 
in return relaxes the blood vessels, helping to lower blood pressure. 
Cardiovascular exercise is the best for lowering blood pressure.
	
✓	Arthritis: Continuous movement is good for your joints because it pro­
motes their strength, flexibility, and resiliency. Both aerobic exercise 
and strength training have been shown to be helpful with joint health. If 
you have a family history of arthritis, then now is the time to help pre­
vent this condition from happening to you.
Better bone health
Bones respond to exercise the same way muscles do: As you exercise, they 
grow stronger. If you’re in your 20s or 30s, you may not think too much about 
bone health, but as you get older, it becomes more and more important. Your 
bone mass peaks in your 30s; after that you can begin losing it.
	
Engaging in regular physical activity improves bone health and helps prevent 
the onset of osteoporosis later in life. Sometimes you have to do an ounce of 
prevention earlier to protect yourself when you get older.
	
For the best chance of strengthening your bones, you should engage in weight-
bearing activity that requires you to work against gravity. Weight-bearing 
activities include
	
✓	Walking
	
✓	Hiking
	
✓	Jogging
	
✓	Tennis
	
✓	Weight lifting
	
✓	Dancing
Reduced stress
Any form of exercise can decrease the body’s stress hormones and relieve 
stress-related tension. That’s good news for anyone trying to lose weight 
because these same stress hormones may be linked to abdominal weight 
gain. And if you’re a stress-eater, you’ll be happy to know that dealing with 
stress also helps alleviate the urge to eat to relieve your stress.

288
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
Often the activity you’re engaged in helps deter your mind from the day’s 
problems and challenges. Why? Because you actually switch your focus 
from those worries to the task at hand. Even if you’re just walking, you begin 
paying attention to the road, the people around you, or the beauty of the 
area. This combination of movement and refocused attention helps lower 
your overall stress level.
Creating an Exercise Plan 
You Can Stick With
Do you ever start an exercise program with good intentions only to watch 
your efforts fade away after about three weeks? You’re definitely not alone. 
You’re likely experiencing this setback for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you 
don’t particularly like exercising or the specific program you’re doing. Maybe 
you jumped in with too much that you can’t commit to, or perhaps you just 
haven’t made exercising a priority in your life. Knowing you need to exercise 
for weight loss and health is one thing, but making exercise work in your life 
is quite another.
	
More important than getting started in an exercise program is maintaining 
that exercise long term. A practical exercise plan should
	
✓	Take up a realistic amount of time for your lifestyle
	
✓	Be challenging enough to give you results
	
✓	Involve one or more activities that you love
An exercise plan that doesn’t meet these criteria is difficult to stick to and 
won’t help you achieve long-term weight loss. The sections that follow help 
you deal with each of the possible reasons why your exercising efforts fail.

exercise program that you can stick with for the long haul.
	
Before you dive into exercise, discuss any and all exercise plans with your 
healthcare provider to guarantee you’ll be engaging in the safest form of exer­
cise for your unique needs.
Dealing with exercise resistance
Does the thought of exercising create a pit in your stomach, or do you tend 
to find excuses not to do it? If so, this section is for you because you may be 
suffering from exercise resistance. It’s not a medical disease, but it can cer­
tainly sabotage your best efforts.

 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
The phrase exercise resistance was first coined in 1996 by Francie White, a 
registered dietitian and exercise physiologist. Francie defines exercise resis­
tance as a conscious or unconscious block against becoming regularly active. 
This block leads to an inactive lifestyle for both children and adults, meaning 
they either can’t be consistent with a physical-activity regimen or they never 
get started with one in the first place. Many people may look at this concept 
and think it’s plain old laziness, but there’s actually a lot more to it.
People who struggle with exercise often experienced past embarrassment 
or shame around physical activity. They’re the kids who were always picked 
last for the team or who were teased for not being a good player. When you 
experience emotional pain from an activity or situation consistently, espe­
cially starting at a young age, you avoid that activity or situation in the future 
at all costs. This is a natural response. It’s sort of like if you got sick on a car­
nival ride when you were four. You likely aren’t going to be excited to get on 
one again in your lifetime, even if the latest research says the Tilt-A-Whirl will 
be helpful for your health and weight . . . speaking from personal experience.
Exercise resistance is also common in dieters. When strict exercise regimens 
are prescribed that people don’t enjoy, they can become resistant to exer­
cising at all. Exercise becomes something they have to do to get the desired 
result rather than something that’s enjoyable. This perception alone can 
make the thought of going to the gym sound like going to the dentist.
	
If you’re beginning to recognize some signs of exercise resistance in your own 
life, or in that of your children, try using one or more of these strategies to 
help overcome them:
	
✓	Explore your personal history regarding exercise. First, identify the 
areas of your life in which you have negative emotions about exercise. 
Were you picked last to play on sports teams? Were you teased for not 
being coordinated? Did you attempt to follow exercise routines you 
didn’t enjoy to lose weight?
	
	Now, think back to any movement that has been enjoyable for you. What 
types of activity bring you to a pleasant emotional state? I must admit — 
I have a little exercise resistance myself. I’m really not a gym person, but 
I absolutely love to swim. I’ll go swimming for the pure enjoyment of it 
anytime. That’s the type of activity you want to find.
	
✓	Make a list of enjoyable activities and try them out. Focus on the 
sheer enjoyment of an activity so you can really connect with how it 
makes you feel. Start by making a list of activities that sound fun to you 
and then think about how to make them a realistic part of your life. For 
example, if you want to get into walking but live in a busy area with 
limited sidewalks, begin to research how, when, and where you can go 
walking. Then make sure you have comfortable shoes for the task. Last 
on the list — enjoy your walk!

290

✓	Practice a little reverse psychology by denying yourself any exercise 
at all (even walking) for two weeks. This is a crazy thought, I know, 
but often when you deny yourself something, your mentality shifts and 
you begin wondering when you can incorporate that something again. 
When you cut out exercising, you literally miss the activity, which helps 
change any negative feelings you have regarding it. Trust me when I say 
that this tactic works! I had to be on moderate bed rest during my preg­
nancy and couldn’t believe how much I yearned to go on a simple walk 
or hike.
	
✓	Try new activities that sound fun. The important thing is that you find 
an activity you enjoy doing. If you enjoy walking or exploring, try going 
for a hike. If you enjoy dancing, take a dance class or turn up your favor­
ite music and dance in your living room with your kids — they’ll love it! 
See the following section for some additional tips for discovering exer­
cise you enjoy.
	
✓	Think outside the box. When I was young, I didn’t excel at sports, but 
the one I always looked forward to playing was kickball. I was discuss­
ing this subject with a friend one day, and he said, “Let’s start a kickball 
team!” We did, and it was so fun to get together with friends and enjoy 
this type of movement. What activities can you think of that apply move­
ment in a nontraditional way for the pure fun of it?
Finding what you enjoy
You may not have exercise resistance (see the preceding section), but you 
may not be dying to go to the gym or take an exercise class either. The trick 
to finding the type of exercise you love is that it must be something you want 
to do for other reasons. For some people, the gym is it. My friend absolutely 
loves the gym and feels it’s her home away from home. Personally, I like 
being in the great outdoors and prefer to hike, walk, or swim.
I always say my grandmother was the best example of someone who truly 
enjoyed activity for many different reasons. She swam every day in the sum­
mertime just because she enjoyed it. She walked to the grocery store because 
it was a nice day and she saw no point in driving such a short distance. She 
was on a bowling league to socialize with friends, and she gardened as a way 
to be outdoors on the weekends. I never heard the word exercise come out of 
her mouth. She did these things because she enjoyed them, but she was able 
to stay in shape at the same time.
	
When you engage in an activity that you don’t necessarily like or that doesn’t 
provide you with some other benefit, you likely won’t stick with it for long. 
Whenever you exercise simply to lose weight, it can feel like a chore. On the 
flip side, when you engage in an activity because you love it or because it pro­
vides you with some other benefit, you’re much more likely to keep at it. Some 
examples of additional benefits include the following:

291
 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
	
✓	Walking with a friend or family member to unwind and vent about 
your day
	
✓	Doing an activity like swimming or bike riding simply because you think 
it’s fun
	
✓	Participating in a group sport like softball because you enjoy competi­
tion and a challenge
	
✓	Using your walk to find a little quiet time alone
If you can’t think of an activity you know you enjoy, then try out some new 
activities until you find the right fit. Granted, the activity you wind up enjoy­
ing the most may not provide you with all the exercise you need, but it’s a 
good starting place for incorporating more movement into your life.
Starting with small steps
I know many people get really motivated when they start a weight-loss pro­
gram and want to jump in full force. However, when you do this with exer­
cise, your efforts can backfire for several reasons:
	
✓	You end up with extreme muscle pain from working out too much when 
you’re unconditioned.
	
✓	Exercise takes up more time than is realistic for your life.
	
✓	You don’t enjoy the activity you’re doing, and it becomes less interest­
ing the next time around.
	
✓	The idea of exercising becomes overwhelming because you’re doing too 
much too soon.
If you’re an exercising newbie, the better approach is to start small. Doing 
so gives you time to ease your body into the activity, especially if you were 
living a sedentary lifestyle before. You may not get the most amazing results 
right away, but by starting small and building on your exercise, you’ll be 
more likely to stick with it.
Taking baby steps when it comes to exercising also helps you find a realistic 
schedule that works in your day-to-day life. Exercising four hours a day prob­
ably won’t work in the real world, but maybe squeezing in 15 minutes two or 
three times a day will.
Making exercise a priority
Exercising requires some focus and rearranging of your priorities. It’s easy 
to want the numerous health benefits that come with exercise (all of which 

292
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
are described earlier in this chapter), but managing your time isn’t quite as 
easy. That takes a little planning, and people often don’t make a plan for how 
they’ll incorporate new changes into their lives.
As I’m sure you know, you can read all the information you want, but if you 
don’t give yourself a plan and time to do the activities necessary, you won’t 
see a whole lot of results from your exercising efforts. The next sections help 
you figure out how to prioritize exercise.
Developing a plan that’s practical for you
If you’re like most folks, your days are probably so packed that health goals 
such as “exercise more” are the things you squeeze in if and when you have 
the time. For many individuals, exercise is the first thing to put off until 
another day. Yet it doesn’t have to be that way.
	
Following are a few strategies to help you create a plan that prioritizes exer­
cise in a realistic, manageable way:
	
✓	Find some time. One of the biggest hurdles of starting an exercise pro­
gram is finding the time to do it. After all, your days are already filled 
up, right? Take a few minutes to examine your schedule. Look for 20- to 
30-minute time increments (or possibly more depending on the type of 
exercise you enjoy). Think about when your exercise will work best. Can 
you squeeze in a swim on your lunch break? Hit the gym in the morning? 
Go for a walk in the evening?
	
✓	Schedule it. Even when you find the time to exercise, you can still put it 
off all too easily or just let something else take priority. But what if you 
treated exercise like a hair appointment? Make that appointment with 
yourself and keep it just like you would if it were a hair appointment.
	
✓	Track it. Keep track of your exercise so you can see just how much 
you’re doing and make sure you’re fitting it in. Take a wall calendar and 
simply mark an S for weight-bearing activity (also known as strength 
training) and a C for cardio activity, followed by the amount of time you 
spent doing the activity. If you’re not seeing results, this log gives you 
a useful tool for gauging how to change your routine; if you’re reaching 
your goals, then it gives you something to celebrate.
Committing to a minimum amount of exercise each day
Sometimes you’ll have troubles prioritizing exercise, or else you’ll find that 
no matter how hard you try, you just can’t keep that appointment with 
yourself. So you start missing a day here and there. Pretty soon that one 
day turns into a week. Before you know it, you haven’t done any exercise for 
three to four weeks!
	
Although there will always be times in your life when you miss out on exer­
cise, the key is to not let one skipped day turn into a week (or more!).

293
 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
	
One way to guarantee you don’t skip too many days is to make a deal with 
yourself to commit to your personal “minimum required exercise plan.” Think 
about some kind of activity that’s really easy for you to do each day, even if 
it’s just for ten minutes. It can be going for a walk or doing some stretching 
exercises. Whatever you choose, the activity needs to be the one that offers 
the least resistance for you. Make a plan that on the days you can’t exercise 
(or the days you just don’t want to) you agree to do your minimum required 
exercise. Even if it doesn’t bring you major results, it’ll keep your mind and 
body in forward motion, helping to make activity a daily habit in your life.
Here are some ideas of activities that may fit the bill for you:
	
✓	Yoga
	
✓	Walking
	
✓	Leg lifts
	
✓	Push-ups
	
✓	Sit-ups
	
✓	Jumping rope
	
✓	Lunges
	
✓	Stair stepping
My minimum required exercise is walking. If I can’t take a walk because of 
weather or the time, then I do a series of leg lifts in the evening before I go 
to bed. Remember: The trick is to think of activities you enjoy for other rea­
sons. For me, walking is a calming form of stress relief.
Including cardio and strength training
Even though all exercise is good for your health, when it comes to weight 
loss, you want to make sure you’re getting the right combination of exercise. 
For years, people primarily focused on cardiovascular exercise to burn calo­
ries. This is still an important focus, but incorporating some strength train­
ing is also important because it helps build muscle mass (which in return 
improves your metabolism, as explained in Chapter 8).
	
Engaging in both cardiovascular exercise and strength training is a winning 
combination for weight loss because you burn more calories and increase 
your metabolic rate at the same time.
Cardiovascular exercise involves activities that get your heart rate up, such 
as fast-paced walking, jogging, swimming, or using a StairMaster or elliptical 
machine. Strength training includes activities such as lifting weights or using 
resistance bands to build muscle.

294
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
Health professionals recommend some form of cardiovascular exercise every 
day. Strength training is recommended at least every other day (to allow the 
muscles to rebuild). However, some people opt to do a form of strength train­
ing every day; they just choose different muscle groups to focus on (lower 
body one day, upper body the next, and so on). Form and careful move­
ment are essential if you want to maximize the exercise and protect yourself 
from injury. A visit with a personal trainer can provide you with specifics 
on how to begin a combined cardio/strength training routine effectively and 
safely. You can also check out Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Suzanne 
Schlosberg and Liz Neporent (Wiley) for supplementary info.
	
Don’t be surprised if you start to feel your hunger cues more after a few weeks 
of this combination. That’s a good sign that your body is responding to the 
exercise. The goal with this combination is to not only make a calorie deficit so 
you can lose weight but to also create a situation where you get to eat more. 
Maintaining weight loss is far easier when you’re eating a good amount of calo­
ries than when you’re trying to live your life eating only 1,200 calories a day.
	
If you’re having trouble pinpointing a good cardio/strength training routine 
that works for you, consider seeking out the guidance of a personal trainer. Be 
sure to let him know the activities you enjoy so he can help you incorporate 
Can’t think of an exercise routine?
If you’re having trouble coming up with an 
exercise routine, why not try the 10,000 steps 
program? It’s easy to do and works great for 
weight loss if you currently live a fairly seden­
tary lifestyle. The goal is to work up to walk­
ing 10,000 steps each day, or roughly 5 miles. 
Here’s how to get started:
	 1.	 Buy a step pedometer.
	
	 You can find a basic step pedometer for 
about $20 at your local sporting goods store 
or drug store. To use it, just clip it securely 
to your waistband or belt, set it to zero, and 
then forget about it for the rest of the day.
	 2.	 Find your baseline.
	
	 Your baseline is the average number of steps 
you’re likely to walk each day. At the end of 
your first day wearing the pedometer, simply 
read your results and write them down in a 
log. On average, most Americans take about 
900 to 3,000 steps per day.
	 3.	 Increase your steps by 500 steps per day for 
a week.
	
	 If your baseline is 900 steps, increase to 
1,400 steps for a week. Then increase to 
1,900 steps the following week.
	 4.	 Continue this process until you reach your 
goal of 10,000 steps.
Note: You don’t have to get in all of your steps 
in one fell swoop. The goal is to get you walking 
more during the entire day.
Tip: If you don’t see results, make your steps a 
little more challenging by increasing the rate of 
your walk or hitting some hills.

295
 Chapter 21: Incorporating Exercise into Your Life
them into your exercise plan. Personal trainers can also teach you proper 
exercise technique to avoid injury. Yes, a personal trainer will cost you a bit, 
but the expense will be well worth it when you walk away with an exercise 
plan that works for you long term.
Fueling Your Exercise Routine 
with a Low-Glycemic Diet
What you eat can certainly impact how well you feel during your exercise 
routine. It can also determine whether you’re getting the most out of your 
workout. Eating a nutritionally balanced low-glycemic diet gives you a great 
foundation for adequately fueling your exercise routine. However, if you 
prefer a little more direction, follow these tips to improve your workout:
	
✓	Consume an adequate amount of carbohydrates. When you exercise, 
your muscles burn a type of carbohydrate called glycogen for fuel. 
You can’t produce optimal glycogen stores with a high-protein, low-
carbohydrate diet. To keep your body’s fuel stores primed for peak 
performance, you need to eat a diet that’s rich in low-glycemic carbo­
hydrates, such as fruits and vegetables. I also recommend going for 
the low-glycemic whole grains — brown rice, quinoa, pearl barley, and 
100-percent whole-grain bread.
	
✓	Eat your protein. Active people need more protein than people who live 
a sedentary lifestyle largely because protein assists in muscle building 
and tissue repair. Include lean meats, fish, soy, and eggs in your diet 
regularly and make sure your post-workout meal contains a significant 
protein source.
	
✓	Load up on fruits and veggies. There’s just no mistaking how important 
fruits and vegetables are to your health. When you exercise, you breathe 
harder and take in more oxygen. Even though you need oxygen to sup­
port life, it can become unstable in the body and damage your muscle 
cells, leading to inflammation and soreness. You can protect yourself 
from oxidation by eating healthful amounts of the antioxidants found 
in fruits and vegetables. Be sure to eat at least five servings of low-
glycemic fruits and vegetables a day. (Check out Chapter 22 to see 
which low-glycemic foods offer the biggest antioxidant boost.)
	
✓	Drink, drink, drink. The more you exercise, the more you sweat. 
Replacing your body’s lost fluid is vital for peak performance and endur­
ance (you’ll definitely feel fatigued if you don’t drink enough water). 
Always keep a bottle of water on hand during long workouts. Also, try to 
drink at least eight 8-ounce servings of water per day to help keep your 
body hydrated.

296
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	
✓	Fuel up before a workout. Eating something before you work out not 
only lengthens your workout but also increases your endurance. If you 
don’t eat before you exercise, you can wind up feeling light-headed; you 
may even experience fatigue and nausea. In addition, not eating before a 
workout means your body must turn to muscle protein for fuel because 
it doesn’t have enough carbohydrates. By starting your workout well 
fueled, your body will burn a combination of the carbohydrates stored 
in your muscles and stored fat. Try to eat a meal or snack that features 
low-glycemic carbohydrates, is low in fat, and contains a moderate 
amount of protein two to four hours before a workout or event in order 
to keep your system well fueled. (Note: If you prefer to work out as soon 
as you wake up in the morning, this can be difficult. Try to have a small 
piece of fruit and a glass of water, but only if that doesn’t make your 
stomach feel upset when you start your workout.)
	
✓	Fuel up after a workout. To ensure optimal recovery of your muscles, 
you need to consume calories and fluids within the first 30 minutes after 
you exercise. Doing so allows you to rebuild your glycogen stores so 
they’re ready to go the next day. If you aren’t hungry right after a work­
out, a quick snack that includes carbohydrates and protein will do. Don’t 
forget to eat a protein-containing meal later on to help repair the muscle 
damage caused during your workout.
	
	Note: Although there’s some evidence that choosing high-glycemic 
foods may be a more effective method of replenishing glycogen stores 
post-workout, this research applies primarily to endurance athletes. The 
Average Joe or Jane is better off sticking with low-glycemic foods.
Pairing a low-glycemic breakfast with moderate 
exercise to (maybe?) burn more fat
The glycemic index is being observed more 
and more in scientific communities. One small 
British study published in March 2009 found 
that eating a low-glycemic breakfast enhances 
the fat-burning effects of moderate exercise 
among sedentary women.
The study’s participants were assigned either 
a high-glycemic breakfast or a low-glycemic 
breakfast. That’s the only variable that changed; 
the amount of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and 
calories stayed the same. The women remained 
at rest for three hours after breakfast and then 
walked at a moderate pace on a treadmill for 
60 minutes. During that time, fat oxidation was 
twice as high for those women who ate the low-
glycemic breakfast compared to those who ate 
the high-glycemic breakfast.
Although this is very promising information for 
people working toward weight loss, it’s impor­
tant to remember that this is just one small 
study. Further research is needed to confirm 
that a low-glycemic breakfast combined with 
moderate exercise helps burn more fat. Of 
course, enjoying a low-glycemic breakfast 
each day is still a good idea. Flip to Chapter 
16 for some yummy recipes that work whether 
you’re on the go or preparing breakfast ahead 
of time.

Not Just for Weight Loss: Battling 
Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
In This Chapter

▶	Discovering low-glycemic foods that are rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients
W
hether you’re healthy or you have either preexisting health condi­
tions or a family history of certain health issues, following a low-
glycemic diet can help you in many ways. Originally studied for diabetes and 
insulin-resistance disorders, the glycemic index is now being looked at more 
and more for other positive effects such as promoting heart health. Even 
though the glycemic index has been around for a while, the research is really 
picking up the pace lately, and I imagine there will be more and more exciting 
discoveries along the way.
In addition to helping you manage certain health conditions, a low-glycemic 
diet also lends itself well to disease prevention. This characteristic of the 
diet is especially important if you’re feeling healthy now but happen to have 
a family history of heart disease or diabetes. You can make many changes in 
your lifestyle to avoid developing these health problems yourself, and a low-
glycemic diet is one of them.
If you have close family members living with chronic health conditions, you 
know firsthand how they can affect your quality of life. This chapter is all 
about how you can take control with small changes to your way of life that 
add more nutrient-rich, low-glycemic foods to your diet.
Managing Existing Health Problems
For many people who are serious about weight loss, the desire to shed pounds 
goes beyond just wanting to fit into “skinny jeans.” It’s about helping manage 
an existing health issue. Most of these issues center on insulin resistance, 

298
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
a condition in which the body can’t handle the sugar in the blood provided 
by the food you eat (see Chapter 5 for full details). Insulin resistance can 
make losing weight difficult. Then again, if you gain too much weight, the 
insulin resistance gets worse. It’s a vicious cycle that can become quite frus­
trating. If you’re in the middle of this cycle right now, I’m sure you can relate 
to the challenges it creates. But hope is here. Following a low-glycemic diet 
has been found to be of great success for those dealing with insulin resis­
tance because eating low-glycemic foods keeps blood sugar from spiking as 
much, thereby requiring much less insulin.
Research is also pointing out benefits of a low-glycemic diet for other health 
issues such as heart disease and even hypothyroidism. The sections that 
follow focus on several specific health issues and how following a low-
glycemic diet can improve your quality of life if you have one of them.
	
If you have diabetes, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, hypothyroidism, heart dis­
ease, metabolic syndrome, or hypoglycemia, be sure to consult your doctor 
before diving headfirst into a low-glycemic diet. He or she may want to moni­
tor your health condition more closely as you make changes to your diet.
	
Regardless of your specific health condition, there are several signs that fol­
lowing a low-glycemic diet is doing your body good. Celebrate your transition 
to a low-glycemic diet if you experience any of the following:
	
✓	Fewer food cravings
	
✓	Increased energy
	
✓	Weight loss
	
✓	Decreased insulin levels
	
✓	Decreased blood sugars
	
✓	Improvement in disease management
Diabetes
Diabetes is a disease in which the body either doesn’t produce enough insu­
lin or doesn’t use it properly. The human body uses insulin to convert sugars 
into the energy needed for daily life. Think of it as a key that unlocks the door 
to your cells so the sugars from the food you eat can enter your bloodstream 
and be used as energy. This system is impaired in people with diabetes, 
causing them to have excess blood sugar and high insulin levels. Following 
a low-glycemic diet helps you avoid large blood sugar spikes so you can 
more easily control your blood sugar with less insulin. (Why? Because low-
glycemic foods release sugar into your body more slowly than high-glycemic 
foods.)

299
 Chapter 22: Battling Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
	
Scientists haven’t always been certain that low-glycemic diets make a big 
impact on diabetes because of all the variables involved, such as portion size 
and the individual way people metabolize sugars. A recent review of current 
research looked at whether a low-glycemic diet or a low glycemic load diet 
(which takes portion size into account; see Chapter 4 for details on glycemic 
load) helped people with Type 1 diabetes and people with Type 2 diabetes 
manage their blood sugars. The results showed that a low-glycemic diet helps 
with both types of diabetes. Researchers found that following a low-glycemic 
diet decreased Hgb A1C levels by .5 percent. (Hgb A1C is a lab measurement 
that gives a big picture of a person’s blood sugar over several weeks or 
months.) Another review of research studies found that a low-glycemic diet 
resulted in decreased Hgb A1C levels by .43 percent compared to diets 
touting high-glycemic foods. The conclusion from this review? Following a low-
glycemic diet has a small but clinically useful effect on blood sugar control. 
More research is needed, but clearly studies are showing that a low-glycemic 
diet can be helpful in managing both types of diabetes.
	
If you have diabetes, you’re probably familiar with carbohydrate counting. Don’t 
throw that out the window; doing so could be detrimental to your health (and 
could get you in trouble with your doctor!). Instead, continue using carbohy­
drate counting and other tools while also using a low-glycemic diet as a way to 
choose good carbohydrate sources. Being diabetic means you need to pay more 
attention to your food intake (what, how much, and when). If you haven’t seen 
a registered dietitian, now would be a great time to schedule an appointment to 
help put all of these puzzle pieces together into a manageable form.
	
Here are some simple dietary guidelines for using a low-glycemic diet to help 
manage your diabetes:
	
✓	Be cautious of portion sizes. Much of the glycemic load information out 
there is based on smaller portions than you may eat normally.
	
✓	Eat healthy foods that are low-glycemic instead of loading up on low-
glycemic foods that aren’t so healthy. Junk food (think Snickers bars 
and chocolate cake) is still junk food, no matter how low the glycemic 
level.
	
✓	Always test your blood sugar so you can monitor how your dietary 
choices are stacking up. You’re a unique individual and may metabolize 
foods differently than others. That’s why it’s important to keep track of 
what’s going on with you and only you.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The hormones of women who have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are out 
of balance, which leads to various problems, including ovarian cysts, irregu­
lar menstrual cycles, fertility issues, weight gain, acne, skin tags, excess body 

300
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
and facial hair, and thinning hair on the scalp. If left untreated, PCOS can lead 
to diabetes and heart disease. The exact reason PCOS occurs isn’t yet known, 
but scientists believe there may be a link between insulin resistance and 
PCOS, which is why a low-glycemic diet is helpful.
Insulin resistance reduces insulin sensitivity, which causes less blood sugar 
from the foods you eat to enter your cells to be used as energy. The cells 
become resistant to insulin, and the pancreas responds by releasing more 
and more insulin to help the blood sugar enter the cells. In return, these high 
insulin levels stimulate the ovaries to produce large amounts of the male hor­
mone testosterone, which in turn leads to symptoms such as infertility and 
ovarian cysts. This buildup of blood sugar remains in the bloodstream and 
is sent to the liver and muscles. After it reaches the liver, it’s converted to 
fat and stored throughout the body, leading to weight gain and obesity. You 
can see what a challenging health condition PCOS is. If you have it, I’m sure 
you’ve experienced many of these obstacles to your well-being.
Getting blood sugar and insulin levels under control is a key factor in treat­
ing individuals with PCOS, and following a low-glycemic diet can help lessen 
blood sugar spikes and keep insulin levels down. It can also help reduce the 
weight gain that results with PCOS. Granted, further research is still required 
to gauge the exact impact of a low-glycemic diet on PCOS, but until that data 
is available, know that this diet provides you with a good strategy for getting 
your blood sugar and insulin well under control.
	
If you have PCOS and want to try a low-glycemic diet, follow these guidelines:
	
✓	Choose low-glycemic carbohydrates in the appropriate portion sizes for 
meals and snacks.
	
✓	Eat a diet that gives you 40 to 50 percent of your calories from carbo­
hydrates (compared to the normal 60 percent). Although research is 
needed in this area, many professionals agree that women with PCOS do 
better with a lower-carbohydrate diet.
	
✓	Space your carbohydrates throughout the day to avoid blood sugar 
spikes at one meal.
	
✓	Avoid consuming carbohydrates by themselves even at snack time. 
Couple them with a protein or fat source instead.
	
✓	Choose high-nutrient, low-glycemic carbohydrates and limit your intake 
of low-nutrient foods.
Note: You may need to obtain regular guidance from a registered dietitian 
who specializes in PCOS to find just the right low-glycemic fit for you.

Hypothyroidism
Thyroid hormones are in charge of your body’s metabolism. People with 
hypothyroidism don’t produce enough thyroid hormone, which means they 
have a slower-than-normal metabolism. The symptoms of hypothyroidism 
are numerous and include fatigue, depression, muscle pain and weakness, 
joint stiffness, and a puffy face. But, as you can imagine, two of the biggest 
symptoms are weight gain and difficulty losing weight. The weight gain can 
be significant and happen very quickly. I actually have hypothyroidism and 
gained 10 pounds right away when I was first diagnosed, but others report 
anywhere from a 30- to 50-pound weight gain in a short period of time.
As you gain weight, your fat cells begin to fill up with fat. When this happens, 
insulin receptors in the cells can become blocked, causing them to respond 
inadequately to insulin and blood sugar. That high blood sugar causes your 
pancreas to secrete more insulin to help remove the blood sugar from the 
bloodstream so it can enter the cells. Too much insulin increases your 
hunger levels and can lead to a cycle of overeating and more weight gain.
	
Used in conjunction with medication, a low-glycemic diet can help normal­
ize your body’s metabolism if you have hypothyroidism. It can also give you 
better control of your
	
✓	Blood sugar and insulin levels: Recent research is finding a connection 
between hypothyroidism and insulin resistance. Specifically, hypothyroid-
induced weight gain may cause some people to develop insulin resis­
tance. More research is needed in this area, but for now following a low-
glycemic diet to better control blood sugar and insulin is a safe bet.
	
✓	Dietary choices: You may have been able to eat a diet that was more 
moderate before, but dealing with hypothyroidism tends to require a 
little more structure of one’s food choices in order to manage weight. 
A low-glycemic diet provides that needed structure, while still allowing 
for variety. Eating a low-glycemic diet and following the healthy-eating 
strategies in Chapter 9 will help you control your calories, eat high-fiber, 
high-nutrient foods, and mange your weight more successfully.
	
Put these tips into practice to make a low-glycemic diet work for you if you 
have hypothyroidism:
	
✓	Try to eat every four to five hours to avoid the negative effect on your 
metabolism caused by skipping meals. (See Chapter 8 for more on 
metabolism.)
	
✓	Get moving! You can’t just rely on the foods you eat (or don’t eat) to 
boost your metabolism. Help pump up your metabolism by engaging in 
calorie-burning, muscle-building activities (flip to Chapter 21 for some 
ideas for adding physical activity to your life).

302
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	
✓	Keep a record of your food intake to see what, when, and how much 
you’re consuming. Many times people don’t realize how big their portions 
truly are. (Head to Chapter 6 for pointers on starting a food journal.)
Heart disease
Heart disease takes many different forms, all of which affect the heart in dif­
ferent ways. The one common thread? If serious enough, any form of heart 
disease can interfere with your heart’s life-sustaining pumping.
One example of how the low-glycemic approach can help heart health 
relates to triglycerides. Many foods that are high in sugar are high-glycemic. 
Too many of these foods (and their effect on your body’s blood sugar and 
insulin functioning) can elevate triglyceride levels, posing increased risk 
on the heart. The research has been a bit conflicting, but an average of the 
responses from 37 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition shows that following a low-glycemic diet has a consistent benefit 
for heart health. Specifically, findings demonstrate that eating a low-glycemic 
diet increases HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers triglycerides. This result 
may be due to the decreased intake of most sugary foods or the increased 
intake of high-fiber foods — either way, it’s a good thing.
	
Healthy fats and fiber are still a big part of the overall healthy heart picture. 
Don’t forget about them. Instead, weave information about a low-glycemic life­
style into what you already know about good nutrition and heart health.
	
If you have risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol (or low 
HDLs) or high triglycerides and want to try a low-glycemic diet to help 
decrease these risk factors, here are a few tips:
	
✓	Choose low-glycemic carbohydrates in the appropriate portion sizes for 
meals and snacks.
	
✓	Eat high-nutrient, low-glycemic foods such as fruits, vegetables, and 
whole grains.
	
✓	Avoid trans fats and limit your intake of saturated fats (think high-fat 
cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products).
	
✓	Bulk up your fiber intake with a goal of eating 25 to 35 grams per day. 
Not sure how much that is? Well, consider that a great whole-grain 
bread has an average of 3 to 4 grams of fiber in each slice.
	
✓	Increase your fruit and vegetable servings to five to nine servings per day.
	
✓	Eat plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, walnuts, and 
flaxseeds. Note: Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and halibut are better 
sources of omega-3s than plant-based sources.

 Chapter 22: Battling Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
Metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome (also known as Syndrome X or Insulin Resistance 
Syndrome) is a cluster of symptoms that include high cholesterol, high inflam­
mation markers, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, 
increased abdominal weight, and elevated insulin levels. This is a very tricky 
health condition, but diet can have a big impact on it if done in the right way. 
The hard part is you can’t just focus on fat for the cholesterol and inflamma­
tion; you also need to focus on carbohydrates for the blood sugar, insulin 
levels, and triglycerides. This balancing act requires a little more structure 
than some conditions, and a low-glycemic diet can provide this much-needed 
structure.
Because insulin resistance is so common among people dealing with meta­
bolic syndrome (some health professionals even consider it to be the under­
lying cause), a low-glycemic diet is key to managing this condition. By getting 
your insulin levels under control and losing weight, you greatly reduce your 
risk for developing multiple symptoms of metabolic syndrome.
So just how does a low-glycemic diet affect metabolic syndrome? Well,
	
✓	It helps reduce inflammation in the body. One study showed that women 
who ate higher amounts of whole grains, bran, and cereal fiber — all of 
which are important foods on a low-glycemic diet — had lower inflam­
mation markers. Women who specifically ate a low-glycemic diet also 
had lower inflammation markers.
	
✓	It can decrease triglycerides by lowering the amount of excess calories, 
which can be converted into triglycerides, and reducing insulin levels, 
which can also increase triglyceride levels if they’re too high.
	
✓	It helps lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure by promoting weight 
loss. It’s also beneficial for cholesterol levels because of the increase in 
fiber intake, which helps remove excess cholesterol from the body.
	
Recent research shows there may be some excellent outcomes with losing a 
moderate amount of weight as well as eating low-glycemic foods. For people 
with metabolic syndrome, research shows a 6.5-percent reduction in weight 
can significantly reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and triglyc­
erides. Depending on your situation, this means you don’t need to lose a dras­
tic amount of weight in order to make major changes in your condition. So, for 
example, someone who weighs 185 pounds only needs to lose 12 pounds to 
begin seeing significant results in her health status. Eating low-glycemic, high-
nutrient foods can keep you feeling fuller for longer, cutting down on the crav­
ings and eating binges that can make it tough to lose weight.

304
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	
Here are some dietary tips for following a low-glycemic diet when you have 
metabolic syndrome:
	
✓	Pick low-glycemic carbohydrates for your meals and snacks, in reason­
able portion sizes, and spread them out throughout the day to avoid 
experiencing a blood sugar spike in one sitting.
	
✓	Avoid eating carbohydrates alone; pair them with a protein or fat 
source.
	
✓	Decrease the amount of saturated fats and eliminate the trans fats in 
your diet.
	
✓	Start eating fatty fish, walnuts, and/or flaxseeds for their omega-3 fatty 
acids. (Omega-3s are also known to decrease inflammation.)
	
✓	Incorporate at least five servings of fruits and vegetables in your diet 
each day.
	
Metabolic syndrome can be extremely frustrating and scary because one con­
dition (a symptom such as high blood pressure) can lead to another. Working 
with a team of health professionals is important to improve and/or correct 
these conditions. Speak with your doctor and meet with both a registered 
dietician and an exercise trainer. This team of health professionals can tailor 
guidelines to your specific needs so you can improve your overall health.
Hypoglycemia
In short, hypoglycemia is a condition that results when your blood sugar 
gets too low. Many people feel they have hypoglycemia, but an actual 
clinical diagnosis is rare and is most commonly seen in diabetics as a 
result of medications.
Even without a clinical diagnosis, you may be one of many individuals who’s 
sensitive to the highs and lows of your daily blood sugar. The symptoms of 
low blood sugar include
	
✓	Hunger
	
✓	Trembling
	
✓	Light-headedness
	
✓	Sweating
	
✓	Irritability or anxious feelings
Eating a low-glycemic diet counteracts hypoglycemia by maintaining an 
even level of blood sugar in your body throughout the day because you’re 
not overindulging in high-glycemic foods. Following a low-glycemic diet also 
helps control a situation called rebound hypoglycemia, which occurs when 

305
 Chapter 22: Battling Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
you eat a high-glycemic food that causes you to first experience a high blood 
sugar spike and then come crashing down quickly. (This description holds 
true even if you don’t have a clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia but do feel 
some similar symptoms of low blood sugar.)
	
Avoiding the highs and lows of blood sugar can certainly make a big difference 
for people with hypoglycemia (or anyone who’s just plain sensitive to her 
blood sugar levels). Following are some tips for incorporating low-glycemic 
eating habits to help reduce blood sugar sensitivity:
	
✓	Eat frequent meals and snacks every three to four hours.
	
✓	Incorporate low-glycemic carbohydrates with protein and/or fat.
	
✓	If you’re diabetic, monitor your blood sugar regularly to catch times 
when it’s dropping. (Your physician can help you determine whether 
you need a change in your medication.)
Wellness and Disease Prevention
Many diseases can be prevented through lifestyle changes, starting with 
embracing a low-glycemic diet. This is another one of those messages that’s 
heard so much it somehow loses its value. You may think you have to make 
drastic changes in your diet and exercise to see a positive effect on your 
health, but the reality is that very small changes can make a big impact.
Perhaps the best change you can make is to increase your daily consumption 
of fruits and vegetables. Plant-based foods are powerful and can affect your 
health in many ways. I strongly encourage you to do two things: Work toward 
eating five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day and add beans, 
lentils, and whole grains to your daily menu. If you haven’t noticed the trend 
yet, the answer to weight loss, disease prevention, and managing existing 
diseases is increasing your intake of these plant-based foods, all of which are 
low in calories. Better yet, most are also low-glycemic and provide a signifi­
cant source of fiber. So if you change up your plate to include more plant-
based foods and fewer meats and starches, you’ll find the key to permanent 
weight loss and living your healthiest life.
In the following sections, I explain some of the ways in which the small 
dietary changes that come with a low-glycemic diet strengthen your body’s 
overall wellness and disease-prevention abilities.

Lowering your risk of chronic diseases
Did you know you don’t have to hit your goal weight to gain health benefits? 
You don’t need to eat a perfect diet to lower your risk of disease either. 
Research shows you can improve your overall health just by incorporating 
simple dietary and exercise changes. I don’t know about you, but this infor­
mation increases my motivation because it means I don’t have to be perfect 
to optimize my health outcomes.
	
A low-glycemic diet works well for most people because it focuses on eating 
high-nutrient, plant-based foods. Guess what. Eating those same foods is also 
the key to weight loss, disease prevention, and wellness.
Following are some research statistics that show how making simple dietary 
changes (such as eating low-glycemic, high-nutrient foods) helps protect you 
from developing a chronic illness:
	
✓	Losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight reduces the risk of chronic ill­
nesses such as diabetes and heart disease.
	
✓	Estimates from a multistudy report show that if the only change people 
made was to include five servings of fruits and vegetables in their daily 
diet, overall cancer rates would decline by 20 percent.
	
✓	According to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 
men and women with the highest consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
a median of 5.8 servings per day among women and 5.1 servings per day 
among men, were found to have a 31 percent lower risk of suffering from 
a stroke. One stroke can lead to a host of chronic health conditions (one 
of which is being at higher risk for having a second stroke).
	
✓	People consuming four or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day 
had a decreased risk for coronary heart disease. Those with an intake of 
at least eight servings a day produced an even greater decrease. Green 
leafy vegetables and vitamin C–rich fruits and vegetables appeared to 
contribute most to the apparent protective effect of total fruit and veg­
etable intake.
	
✓	The Nurses’ Health Study found that women who ate the most high-
glycemic foods had a 50-percent greater risk of developing diabetes than 
those who primarily ate a diet of low-glycemic foods.
	
Although eating the right amount of low-glycemic, plant-based foods contrib­
utes a great deal to your body’s wellness and disease prevention, it doesn’t do 
the job alone. Other lifestyle components — exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, 
sleeping, and stress — matter too. Work on all aspects of your health to feel 
your best and significantly reduce your risk of developing a chronic disease.

307
 Chapter 22: Battling Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
	
The younger you are, the more important it is to start taking an active 
approach to your health. Many studies show that long-term dietary and health 
changes may make a bigger impact than short-term changes. All changes are 
good and will help you no matter what your age, but starting off when you’re 
younger gives you a leg up!
Fighting free radicals with antioxidants
Free radicals (unstable molecules) form when your body’s cells burn oxygen 
(scientists call this process oxidation). They also form when you smoke and 
when you’re exposed to sun, pollution, and harmful chemicals. Free radicals 
basically rip through your body and cause damage to your cells, tissues, and 
DNA, kind of how the Tazmanian Devil (that’s right, the old Looney Toons 
character) used to spin out of control, damaging everything in his path. The 
damage to your body caused by free radicals may leave you at greater risk 
for chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. What can defeat them? 
Antioxidants. These puppies save the day by neutralizing free radicals so 
they can’t cause damage.
	
Have you ever left an apple slice on the kitchen counter and come back an 
hour later to a brown apple? The browning effect is from oxidation. When you 
add orange juice to the apple slice, it stays white because it’s protected by the 
antioxidant vitamin C.
Free radicals will form in your body no matter how hard you try to decrease 
your exposure to the things that cause them. Consequently, your diet is your 
first line of defense. Luckily for you, many low-glycemic foods are also rich in 
vitamins that act as antioxidants — vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene.
	
Before you go out and stock up on vitamins, you should know that supple­
ments may not be the answer. Research on antioxidants and how they work 
in the body is ongoing. At this point, no one knows how much is too much or 
how the nutrients work together. Research suggests that there may be a syn­
ergy between the different vitamins and possibly other chemicals in food that 
give your body the antioxidant benefits. Therefore, taking a vitamin C supple­
ment may not provide the same benefit as eating an orange.
	
Getting as many of your vitamins as possible from food sources is always best. 
Supplements are exactly that — supplements. They’re meant to supplement 
what you don’t get from your diet, not replace your diet. Instead of popping 
supplements, focus on eating a variety of low-glycemic fruits, vegetables, and 
whole grains to get the appropriate synergy of nutrients made especially for 
you by Mother Nature.

The beauty of embracing a low-glycemic diet for weight loss is that the better 
you follow the guidelines of filling up your plate with veggies and incorporating 
more fruits and whole grains into your meals, the more you naturally up your 
antioxidant intake. You don’t have to go out of your way to add something new. 
Instead, just get a good variety, which is more fun for your taste buds anyway!
Factoring in phytonutrients
Besides vitamins and minerals, plant-based foods offer phytonutrients, 
naturally occurring compounds with potential health benefits. To date, 

309
 Chapter 22: Battling Disease with a Low-Glycemic Diet
certain phytonutrients have been shown to work as antioxidants, contain 
anti-inflammatory properties, and promote heart health. Phytonutrients are 
found abundantly in fruits and vegetables, making your low-glycemic diet 
strategy a win-win.
	
Care to know a cool fact about phytonutrients? Well, in addition to provid­
ing great health benefits, they provide the pigment for fruits and vegetables, 
which means you can basically determine the health benefits a food offers 
simply by looking at its color. Adding a variety of color to your plate can moti­
vate you to diversify the types of plant-based foods you eat as well. Table 22-2 
highlights the health benefits of certain colors of foods.

What’s your disease risk?
I’m guessing that someone you know (maybe 
even you yourself) has heart disease, high 
cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or 
some type of cancer. Nowadays even children 
and young adults have some of these issues. 
The good news is that making simple lifestyle 
changes can help reduce your risk for these 
conditions. That’s right — lifestyle changes, 
not some magic cure or fad health or diet 
craze. Take the following quiz to determine 
your risk for disease and see what you can do 
to reduce it:

310
Part V: Improving Your Overall Lifestyle: Other Health Connections 
	✓	Do you have a family history of heart dis­
ease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
	
	 These conditions have a genetic connec­
tion, so if your sibling, parent, grandparent, 
or other relative has, say, heart disease, 
you’re at greater risk for developing that 
too. I know many people take family medi­
cal history lightly, but knowing yours and 
acting on that knowledge is a good way to 
optimize your health now so you can avoid 
future complications.
	✓	Do you smoke cigarettes?
	
	 Smoking has a direct correlation with some 
cancers (particularly lung cancer), cardio­
vascular disease, and emphysema. If you’re 
a smoker, you can help protect yourself 
from these conditions by quitting. I know 
giving up smoking is often easier said than 
done for many. Find some help at www.
smokefree.gov.
	✓	For women, do you drink more than one 
alcoholic beverage a day? For men, do you 
drink more than two alcoholic beverages 
a day?
	
	 Alcohol is tricky when it comes to health. 
On one side, there have been reports that 
drinking alcohol, specifically red wine, 
can be beneficial to your health. However, 
these benefits only occur when you drink in 
moderation, meaning one beverage a day 
for women and two a day for men. When 
you go past this amount on a regular basis, 
you begin to have long-term health risks 
such as dementia, cardiovascular disease, 
stroke, and certain types of cancer. Keep 
your alcohol consumption to a moderate 
level to help avoid these problems.
	✓	Do you eat at least three to five servings 
of fruits and vegetables a day, as well as 
whole-grain products?
	
	 Without these foods in your diet, you have 
little antioxidants at work for you. Start 
by making a list of all the fruits and veg­
gies that you enjoy and begin incorporat­
ing them with every meal and snack. The 
recipe chapters in Part IV feature several 
ways to add delicious and nutritious fruits, 
veggies, and whole grains to your diet.
	✓	Are you at a healthy weight?
	
	 A person may be statistically overweight 
without showing any signs of a major 
health problem. However, research shows 
that being overweight does lead to a higher 
incidence of diabetes and cardiovascu­
lar disease, as well as some cancers. 
Decreasing your weight by 5 to 7 percent 
can help lower your risk for developing 
these chronic diseases.
	✓	Do you get regular exercise?
	
	 Lack of exercise is also connected with 
many chronic diseases. Fortunately, you 
don’t have to become a triathlete to get 
some of the major benefits of exercise. 
So long as you get at least 30 minutes of 
moderate physical activity at least five days 
a week, you’ll be doing your body right. If 
you’re a couch potato, why not work on 
walking for 30 minutes a day and then go 
from there? (Here’s a hint: You can break up 
that 30 minutes into smaller chunks if that 
makes it seem more manageable for you.)
If you answered yes to any of the first three 
questions and no to any of the remaining ques­
tions, you’re probably at a greater risk for dis­
ease than you thought. Talk to your doctor and 
begin thinking about ways to implement some 
of the suggested lifestyle changes in your day-
to-day affairs. Then make a commitment to 
yourself to stick with those changes!

A
 wealth of misinformation about the glycemic index 
is floating around out there, and in this part, I give 
you the honest truth. I provide easy-to-understand expla­
nations about key glycemic index concepts, and I help 
you discover additional fun health facts about some 
common low-glycemic foods. I also include ten surprising 
low-glycemic foods that you may not have tried before. 
After reading this part, you’ll feel better about including 
them in your meal planning from time to time.

Glycemic Index
In This Chapter

▶	Realizing that not all high-glycemic foods are poor nutritional choices
▶	Proving that calories still count, whether a food is low-glycemic or not
P
lenty of myths are floating around about the glycemic index these 
days. It seems like just about everyone knows something about it and 
is happy to tell you which foods to eat as well as which high-glycemic foods 
to avoid. The truth is that measuring the glycemic effect of foods is a highly 
precise and scientific process that requires specific testing (as explained in 
Chapter 2). In this chapter, I clear up ten common myths and help you under­
stand how to use the glycemic index of foods to maintain a healthy weight 
and improve the overall nutrition quality of your food choices.
Carrots Are Pure Sugar
The original testing on carrots showed they had a high glycemic index (GI), 
which led to their reputation as a vegetable to avoid. Recent tests, however, 
show carrots actually have a low GI of 35 when raw and 41 when cooked. Plus, 
their glycemic load is only 4! (For more on glycemic load, head to Chapter 4.) 
Carrots are also high in vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Feel free to 
add them to any meal, or enjoy them by themselves as a crunchy snack.
Watermelon Is Bad for You
Watermelon contains high amounts of (here’s a no-brainer) water, giving it a 
low energy density, which means it fills you up and keeps you feeling satisfied 
for a longer period of time. Watermelon is also a good source of potassium, 
vitamin A, and vitamin C.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Watermelon does have a higher GI of 72, but its glycemic load is only 4. That’s 
because there aren’t many carbohydrates available in a serving of watermelon 
due to all the water and fiber. The bottom line? Enjoy fresh watermelon as 
part of a healthy meal or snack. Spitting the seeds is optional!
You Can Never Eat a Potato
Potatoes are high-glycemic, but that doesn’t mean you should ban them 
from your diet. After all, they’re a good source of vitamin B6, potassium, and 
vitamin C, which makes them a healthy addition to meals. Instead of forgo­
ing potatoes, strive for balance on your plate. For example, eat a dinner that 
features a small portion of baked or boiled potato plus a lean protein (such 
as chicken or fish) and 2 cups of low-glycemic veggies (such as green beans, 
broccoli, or tossed salad); the glycemic load of such a meal is moderate. 
(Head to Chapter 15 to check out the suggestion for converting traditional 
potato salad into a lower-glycemic dish.)
You Should Never Eat 
High-Glycemic Foods
First off, a low-glycemic diet is all about moderation, so thinking that you 
can’t ever have that high-glycemic chocolate chip cookie you love is both 
silly and potentially harmful. Second, the glycemic index is only one compo­
nent to consider when choosing which foods you want to eat. You should 
also consider vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, total carbohydrate 
amount, fat content, type of fat, and sodium.
Some higher-glycemic foods, such as popcorn and Cheerios, are made of 
whole grains, which are good sources of fiber. When you want to eat a high-
glycemic food, balance that choice out with a lean protein and other low-
glycemic foods. For example, enjoy whole-grain Cheerios for breakfast served 
with fat-free milk and fresh strawberries, or add a small handful of peanuts to 
your popcorn for a medium-glycemic snack.
	
The amount you eat of a high-glycemic food is often more important than how 
frequently you consume it. Paying attention to your portion sizes of higher-
glycemic foods is an important eating strategy for weight loss. Enjoy a snack-
size portion of microwave popcorn rather than a large bowl, and you’re 
making progress!

315
 Chapter 23: Ten Myths about the Glycemic Index
High-Glycemic Foods Will 
Make You Gain Weight
Weight gain occurs when you consume more calories than you expend. 
Although it’s true that some high-glycemic foods are higher in calories 
(French fries, for example, have a higher GI of 64), it’s also true that some 
lower-glycemic foods are high in calories. Chocolate cake with chocolate 
frosting, often a favorite birthday cake choice, has a GI of only 38. Yet it cer­
tainly wouldn’t be on any dieter’s list of “foods to eat on a daily basis.”
	
If your goal is to lose weight and keep it off, pay attention to both the calorie 
content of the foods you eat as well as their glycemic index. And don’t forget 
to exercise regularly too!
You Can Eat as Many Low-Glycemic 
Foods as You Want and Lose Weight
What a world it’d be if this myth were true! Unfortunately, it’s not. Yes, you 
can eat all the low-glycemic foods you want — but you still need to factor cal­
ories into the equation if you want to lose weight. Why? Because some low-
glycemic foods are high in calories. Nuts, for example, have a GI of less than 
30. Yet 1 ounce of mixed nuts contains 166 calories, and most people find it 
very difficult to limit themselves to just 1 ounce of nuts. A handful of nuts is 
at least 1⁄2 cup — and that amount of nuts contains more than 400 calories!
	
Even if you choose low-calorie, low-glycemic foods, you should still pay atten­
tion to the amount you’re eating. Calories add up quickly, and overeating 
leads to weight gain and health problems.
High-Glycemic Foods 
Cause Type 2 Diabetes
Eating high-glycemic foods, or even consuming carbohydrates for that 
matter, doesn’t cause Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the result of a com­
plex combination of genetics and environmental effects such as obesity and 
lack of exercise. After someone is diagnosed with diabetes, he or she must 
engage in careful meal planning to control calories and carbs because con­
suming large amounts of high-glycemic foods can make managing the disease 
more difficult. However, a poor diet isn’t the reason someone develops this 
form of diabetes.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Low-Glycemic Foods Are 
Always Nutritious
For a food to be considered nutritious, it must follow USDA guidelines and 
be high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Additionally, it needs to be low in 
saturated fat and sodium. Many low-glycemic foods really are nutritious, but 
that’s because they meet all of the USDA’s guidelines for nutritious foods. 
Some lower-glycemic foods, such as Snickers candy bars, just don’t meet all 
of those requirements.
	
Just because a food is low-glycemic doesn’t mean it automatically qualifies as 
nutritious.
All High-Glycemic Foods Have Little 
or No Nutritional Value
Some high-glycemic foods contain good amounts of essential vitamins and 
minerals; they may even be good sources of fiber. For example, many cold 
breakfast cereals, even ones made from whole grains, have a higher glycemic 
index. Yet breakfast cereals are fortified with a variety of vitamins and miner­
als, and starting the day with cereal for breakfast is known to improve one’s 
overall daily nutrient intake. Additionally, whole-grain breads may be high-
glycemic, but they’re a great way to increase your fiber intake (plus they’re 
fortified with folate and iron). Don’t be afraid to look beyond the glycemic 
index to discover the true nutrition content of the foods you eat.
Low-Glycemic Foods All Have 
Low Calories
Contrary to what the myth-spouters tell you, the glycemic index has nothing 
to do with calories. Stating that all low-glycemic foods are low in calories is a 
bit like saying everyone who drives a four-door sedan wears yellow socks. Ice 
cream, even high-fat specialty ice cream, is low-glycemic, yet everyone knows 
it’s high in calories.
	
Take the time to investigate a food’s calorie content as well as its glycemic 
index. Choosing low-glycemic foods that are also low in calories is a great 
weight-loss strategy.

Chapter 24
Ten Surprising 
Low-Glycemic Foods
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing that sweet foods aren’t always high-glycemic
▶ Fixing the perceptions of certain fruits and veggies as overly sugary
W
hen you get down to it, you can’t determine a food’s glycemic index 
(or glycemic load for that matter) simply by reading its list of ingredi-
ents or by knowing the amount of carbohydrates and fiber it contains. Sure, 
the majority of low-glycemic foods are also good sources of fiber, vitamins, 
and minerals, which makes them naturally healthy foods. And yes, many 
high-glycemic foods contain larger amounts of sugars or other sweeteners, 
which traditionally puts them on the unhealthy side. However, that’s a pretty 
simplistic way of looking at things. I bet this list of ten lesser-known low-
glycemic foods will surprise you and give you yet another reason to check 
out Appendix A.
Coca-Cola (GI of 53)
How can a beverage primarily made out of a sweetener possibly be low-
glycemic? Well, the sweetener in Coca-Cola is high-fructose corn syrup, a 
product that was designed to taste just like table sugar but in a liquid form 
so it could be easily used in a variety of beverages. HFCS’s glycemic index 
(GI) is 62, but it isn’t the only sweetener to boast a low GI. Fructose has a GI 
of 19, lactose (found in milk) has a GI of 46, and even sucrose (table sugar) 
has a moderate GI of 60.
The point of the story? Don’t feel guilty for having a Coke, but don’t think you 
can switch from drinking water to guzzling your favorite sweetened beverage 
all day long. There’s more to good health than just a low GI.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Frosted Flakes (GI of 55)
When you read the list of ingredients on a box of Frosted Flakes, here’s what 
you find: milled corn, sugar, malt flavoring, high-fructose corn syrup, salt, 
and a bunch of added vitamins and minerals. You may assume that a sugary 
cereal is automatically high-glycemic, but you’d be wrong in the case of 
Frosted Flakes. Sometimes the results of glycemic index testing counteract 
your intuition. Whether they do or not, always be sure to watch your portion 
sizes. Even a food with a low GI can have a high glycemic load if you eat too 
much of it.
	
The vast majority of breakfast cereals found in the United States have yet 
to undergo testing for their glycemic index, so stick with the lower-glycemic 
breakfast options I share in Chapter 16.
Carrot Cake (GI of 36)
Just because a sweet food (like cake) is made with carrots doesn’t mean 
it’s high-glycemic. Carrots mistakenly have a bad rap as containing a lot of 
sugar, and many people wrongly think that they’re high-glycemic. Would you 
believe that the GI of cooked carrots is actually 41? That’s just slightly higher 
than the GI of a slice of carrot cake! Several other types of cakes and baked 
goods also have a low GI; these include fruit muffins such as apple or blue­
berry, banana cake, and chocolate cake. This low number is probably some­
what due to the addition of fat in these recipes.
Pound Cake (GI of 54)
Pound cake received its name because the traditional recipe called for 1 
pound of flour, 1 pound of sugar, 1 pound of butter, and 1 pound of eggs. 
With that ingredient list, you’re probably thinking there’s no way pound cake 
can be low-glycemic. Guess again, my friend. A favorite dessert since the 
1700s, pound cake has a low GI. Top it off with some low-glycemic fresh ber­
ries, and you have a delicious ending to an overall low-glycemic meal.
	
Just because pound cake and other cakes have a low glycemic index doesn’t 
mean you should help yourself to gigantic portion sizes. Many cakes are still 
a source of calories and fat; they also tend to have a high glycemic load when 
you eat more than the recommended portion size.

319
 Chapter 24: Ten Surprising Low-Glycemic Foods
Instant Chocolate Pudding (GI of 47)
Everything about instant chocolate pudding makes you want to believe it 
has a high GI: It’s a sweet dessert that comes in a little box, requires no cook­
ing, and is ready to eat in minutes. Don’t trust your intuition on this one. 
Remember that milk is low-glycemic and that other desserts, such as choco­
late cake, also have a low GI. If you want a sweet, creamy dessert to finish off 
a low-glycemic meal, instant chocolate pudding is a good choice.
Banana (GI of 52)
For some reason, just about everyone I know thinks bananas are high in 
sugar and shouldn’t be enjoyed on a regular basis. The reality is that bananas 
have a low GI, similar to many other types of fruit. (Watermelon is one of 
the only commonly eaten fruits that actually does have a high GI, but that’s 
actually misleading; see Chapter 4 for the explanation why.) Go ahead and 
add bananas (and watermelon!) to your list of fruits you can enjoy on a low-
glycemic diet.
Macaroni (GI of 47)
I think macaroni, and pasta in general, has a reputation as a higher-glycemic 
food because people tend to eat it in large portions. However, even macaroni 
made from white flour has a low GI, which may be one reason why people 
who follow a Mediterranean-style of eating typically enjoy good health.
	
Use this meal-planning tip to enjoy macaroni (and other shapes of pasta): 
Combine a small to moderate amount (1 or 1½ cups) cooked macaroni with at 
least 2 cups of vegetables and 3 to 4 ounces of lean protein (think fish, poultry, 
lean beef, or pork).
Uncle Ben’s White Rice (GI of 38)
Many types of rice have a medium or high GI. (Even brown rice sometimes 
falls into the medium- or high-GI category.) Despite that fact, the Uncle Ben’s 
rice products are typically low-glycemic. In this case, processing actually 
seems to decrease the rice’s glycemic index. So if you’re really craving a low-
glycemic white rice, choose Uncle Ben’s.

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Maple Syrup (GI of 54)
Repeat this statement to yourself: Just because something is sweet doesn’t 
mean it’s automatically high-glycemic. Maple syrup has less of an effect on 
blood sugar levels than you may expect, which gives it a low GI. Real maple 
syrup is actually just a bit sweeter than table sugar and can be part of a low-
glycemic lifestyle.
Corn on the Cob (GI of 48)
Sweet corn may taste sweet, but it has a minimal effect on blood sugar levels. 
So go ahead and feel free to grab one of these traditional late-summer treats 
at the next family or company barbeque — just remember to keep modera­
tion in mind when you start thinking about seconds.

Ten Low-Glycemic Foods with 
Great Health Benefits
In This Chapter
▶	Seeing green with asparagus, broccoli, lettuce, and spinach
▶	Exploring a range of colors and nutritional offerings from cauliflower to tomatoes
S
electing low-glycemic foods rather than high-glycemic ones is always 
a good tactic for weight loss, but you should also pay attention to the 
overall health benefit of a food. Low-glycemic foods are packed with nutri­
tion, specifically fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and healthy mono­
unsaturated fat. Falling into a rut and eating the same foods all the time is 
incredibly easy. Break out of that rut by trying new, lower-glycemic foods 
that not only pump up your health but also taste great!
Lowfat Yogurt
Yogurt is a fermented dairy product made by adding bacteria cultures to milk, 
resulting in a thicker texture and a tart, tangy taste. A wide range of bacteria is 
used to make yogurt, and each different bacteria strain has specific potential 
health benefits. The good news is that all the types of live bacteria found in 
yogurt help promote overall health. Unfortunately, not all yogurt sold contains 
live active cultures. For the purpose of shelf-stability, many yogurts are heat 
treated — a process that kills off the healthy bacteria. So as you’re choosing 
yogurt, select containers that say live active cultures somewhere on the label. 
Also be sure to pick lowfat varieties to avoid unnecessary fat and calories.
	
Yogurt is a good source of calcium, riboflavin, protein, vitamin B12, potas­
sium, and zinc. Many types of yogurt now also contain added vitamin D, which 
together with calcium helps build strong bones. Recent research shows that 
many people are deficient in vitamin D, which can lead to numerous health 
problems such as high blood pressure and some types of cancer. Eating 
yogurt with added vitamin D can help prevent you from developing a vitamin 
D deficiency.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Peanuts
Fun fact for the day: Peanuts aren’t actually a nut — they’re a legume! 
Peanuts are a good source of manganese, tryptophan, niacin, and folate. The 
fat in peanuts is the healthier monounsaturated fat that helps protect against 
heart disease. Peanuts are also a good vegetarian source of protein. Unlike 
animal sources of protein, peanuts contain fiber, specifically 9 percent of 
your daily fiber needs in a 1-ounce serving.
Artichokes
The artichoke is a much-loved vegetable that’s a star of the Mediterranean 
diet, a traditional, heart-healthy way of eating found in countries surrounding 
the Mediterranean Ocean. Artichokes contain a high amount of antioxidants 
that provide an overall boost to your health. They’re also a good source of 
vitamin C. And don’t forget that one medium artichoke has more fiber than 1 
cup of prunes!
	
Often people eat artichokes by pulling off the leaves one at a time and running 
each leaf through their teeth to remove the soft, pulpy portion. If you’re in a 
hurry, choose baby artichokes, which can be eaten whole, or purchase mari­
nated artichoke hearts.
Asparagus
It’s amazing how much nutrition is packed into each tender spear of aspara­
gus. With only four calories per spear, asparagus is a favorite vegetable for 
anyone conscious of her calorie intake. Asparagus is also a good source of 
potassium, fiber, folate, thiamin, and vitamin B6, plus antioxidants (such as 
glutathione) that help protect against cell damage that may lead to cancer. 
Don’t miss the Barley Risotto with Asparagus and Toasted Almonds recipe in 
Chapter 18.
Broccoli
Broccoli routinely makes the list of “super vegetables” that contain extremely 
high amounts of nutrients. It’s a cruciferous vegetable that contains anti­
cancer compounds and phytochemicals that may help protect against heart 
disease. One cup of steamed broccoli contains more than 200 percent of 
your daily intake of vitamin C; it’s also a good source of vitamin K, vitamin A, 
folate, and potassium.

323
 Chapter 25: Ten Low-Glycemic Foods with Great Health Benefits
Cauliflower
Some people think that white vegetables have little nutritional value, but 
cauliflower is actually a nutrition powerhouse. A cruciferous vegetable, cauli­
flower contains compounds that protect against cancer, plus high amounts of 
vitamin C, folate, and fiber.
Lettuce
Hundreds of different types of lettuce are available today, and all of them are 
very low in calories and have high water content, which helps fill you up so 
you feel satisfied longer. Varieties of lettuce with darker-green leaves contain 
higher amounts of vitamins and minerals compared to the lighter-colored 
types of lettuce. For example, romaine lettuce is an excellent source of vita­
min K, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, and manganese. Yet don’t pass up lighter 
green lettuces such as iceberg or butterhead completely; they also contain 
antioxidants and healthy amounts of several vitamins.
Peppers
All colors of peppers are good sources of vitamins A and C. Red bell peppers 
(which are actually fully ripened green peppers with a milder flavor) contain 
lycopene, a phytochemical that may help reduce the risk of some types of 
cancer. Choose a variety of colors of peppers for their taste, visual appeal, 
and nutrition content. (For a tasty dish involving red peppers, look for the 
Tuna Salad with Olives and Red Peppers recipe in Chapter 17.)
Spinach
Popeye was right — spinach is a good vegetable source of iron. It also con­
tains antioxidants that help protect against cancer, as well as vitamins C and 
A to help promote a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. Toss raw baby 
spinach into salads or add it to your favorite rice at the last minute of cook­
ing for a splash of color and flavor. Also, be sure to try the Grilled Chicken 
Spinach Salad recipe in Chapter 17 and the Baked Halibut with Quinoa, 
Spinach, and Cherry Tomatoes recipe in Chapter 18.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Tomatoes
For a vegetable once believed to be poisonous, tomatoes have come a long 
way nutritionally. They’re a rich source of lycopene, especially when cooked. 
Tomatoes are also a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate.

F
irst up is an appendix that lists the glycemic load of 
some foods found in this book’s recipes, plus other 
commonly enjoyed foods. Use Appendix A to search for 
lower-glycemic foods you already enjoy and identify some 
new foods to try out.
And in case you prefer following the metric system, 
Appendix B provides simple conversion tables to make 
switching from ounces to grams a snap.

Appendix A
The Glycemic Load and Common 
Foods: An At-a-Glance Guide
C
onsider this appendix your quick-reference guide to the glycemic infor­
mation for foods used in this book’s recipes as well as some common 
foods. The easy-to-digest information is presented in tables, with each table 
listing specific foods, their portion sizes, and whether the glycemic loads for 
those portion sizes are low, medium, or high. (Remember: A glycemic load 
[GL] of 10 or less is considered low; a GL of 11 to 19 is considered medium; 
and a GL of 20 or more is considered high.) Use this appendix to look up your 
favorite foods to see where they fall, as well as to select low-glycemic foods 
when planning your meals.
	
If you want to eat more of an item than its suggested portion size, just know that 
doing so will likely increase that food’s glycemic load a bit. If that food already 
has a medium-level glycemic load, you may be bumping its glycemic load up to 
the high range. In this situation, consider sticking to the portion size listed (and 
if you’re still hungry, choose a lower-glycemic food to fill you up).
	
A good rule of thumb is to keep your total daily glycemic load under100. If you 
choose mostly low- and medium-glycemic foods, that shouldn’t be a problem.
Bakery Treats
Who doesn’t enjoy a donut, muffin, or cupcake every now and then? 
Choose baked goods made with whole grains and fruit for the healthiest 
and lowest-calorie options. Sweet treats are just that — a sometimes treat, 
not an everyday part of your food choices. So even though the items in 
Table A-1 are medium- to high-glycemic, indulging in them once in a while 
is perfectly okay.

Fruits
Fruit sometimes (and undeservingly!) gets a bad rap because it’s a sweet, 
natural source of carbohydrates. That’s unfortunate, because fruits are quite 
good for you — they provide fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals to 
promote overall health. The glycemic index and glycemic load can help you 
make sound decisions about the healthiest types of fruits to enjoy. Refer to 
Table A-6 and choose fresh fruit as often as possible to take advantage of its 
lower glycemic load compared to snacks like potato chips and candy bars. 
(If you’re looking for tasty ideas for adding more fruit to your diet, try the

Meat Products
Meats, including chicken, fish, beef, and pork, contain no carbohydrates. 
Only carbohydrate-containing foods are part of the glycemic index, so I can’t 
provide glycemic data for meat. However, I can tell you that when you add 
cracker-crumb coating to chicken, dredge fish in flour, or mix dry oatmeal 
or crushed crackers into hamburger for meatloaf or meatballs, you’re incor­
porating carbohydrates into your meat. Table A-9 is handy because you get 
an idea of what the portion sizes should be in order to stay safely in the low-
glycemic category (and within your calorie limits).

Sweeteners and Candy
The glycemic index is just one method of choosing healthy foods. When it 
comes to sweeteners, the key truly is the amount you consume, which is 
why Table A-10 can come in really handy. The glycemic load is based on the 
amount of a food that you eat, or the amount of that food within an entire 
meal. If you made a meal out of sugar or other sweeteners, the glycemic load 

335
 Appendix A: The Glycemic Load and Common Foods: An At-a-Glance Guide
would be high. Use small amounts of sugar only when absolutely necessary, 
and you can tame your sweet tooth quite naturally.

Vegetables
Your mother was right: You really should eat more vegetables. The vast 
majority of vegetables provide plenty of vitamins and minerals along with a 
good dose of fiber and very few calories. As you can see in Table A-11, most 
vegetables even have a low glycemic load (with a few exceptions). You can 
definitely be creative in including more vegetables in your diet. Try prepar­
ing omelets with leftover cooked vegetables or whipping up vegetable-based 
soups for lunch. Making veggies a part of every meal is really easier than you 
may think (see Part IV for some stellar recipe ideas).

Lose weight and improve 
your overall health
Eating fewer carbohydrates may be trendy — but since 
your body needs them to function, eliminating too many 
carbs from your diet is neither healthy nor practical. Enter 
the glycemic index, a proven method for calculating the 
way carbohydrates act in your body to help you lose weight 
safely, quickly, and effectively. The Glycemic Index Diet For 
Dummies presents this system in an easy-to-apply manner, 
giving you the tools and tips you need to shed unwanted 
pounds and improve your overall health. 
•  Explore the glycemic index — find out exactly what the glycemic 
index is and how you can use it to develop a healthier diet and 
lifestyle
•  Get your health back on track — use a low-glycemic diet to help 
control diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, 
metabolic syndrome, and other health conditions  
•  Eat the low-glycemic way — get helpful, easy-to-follow guidelines 
for adding low-glycemic foods to your meals at home, while dining 
out, and on the go
