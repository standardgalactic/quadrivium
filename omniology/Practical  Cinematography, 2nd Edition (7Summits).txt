Preface
When I joined the BBC in the 1960s as a trainee projectionist,I was the
youngest trainee at that time.I was lucky enough to be entering a world
which offered the best possible training for any aspiring ﬁlm-maker.As
I progressed through the grades, becoming eventually one of the six
senior ﬁlm cameramen before leaving to go freelance, I enjoyed a sub-
stantial amount of practical and theoretical training. That training no
longer exists – indeed, the BBC Film Department no longer exists, and
you cannot get that training anywhere now.
One of the most enjoyable aspects of being a Director of Photography
is the opportunity to shoot a wide variety of work.Recently,for instance,
I have shot three hours of 35mm, three hours of Super 16, two hours 
of Digi Beta, and a one-hour television studio opera and three hours of
High Deﬁnition – HD. This variety, combined with the opportunity to
work with different producers, directors, actors and crew, makes ours
one of the most stimulating jobs I know.
Some years ago, I was asked to stand in as Head of Cinematography
at the National Film and Television School. Since then, I have
repeated that enjoyable position. I have also been asked to take vari-
ous short courses in a variety of training establishments, something I
always enjoy doing, if I am not shooting.
Since I wrote the ﬁrst edition of this book, I have had a great deal of
feedback from readers and this has led me to a greater understanding of
their needs. Therefore, this new edition has a more deﬁned purpose – 
to lead a student or someone in a lower grade than the DP to gain the
knowledge to be able to aspire to that most wonderful of jobs – the
Director of Photography.
This edition, therefore, starts with the deﬁnition and description of
the tasks of the DP and goes on to describe all the necessary technical
knowledge one might need to get a commission as a DP.
As I have always found it easier to explain theoretical principles
using diagrams and pictures in preference to relying on words alone,
this book contains a large number of ﬁgures. Indeed, for some of the
sections,I prepared the ﬁgures ﬁrst and then wrote the text afterwards.
In this new edition there are some added chapters, a complete reor-
ganization of the structure of the book, together with many added
illustrations, including over 20 photographs.

About the author
Paul Wheeler has a wealth of practical experience as a cinematog-
rapher combined with wide experience as a highly respected trainer.
After 25 years with the BBC, by the end of which he was one of only
six senior ﬁlm cameramen out of a total of 63 DPs employed there at
that time, he left to go freelance.
In the years since leaving the BBC, Paul has had a ﬂourishing career
which has bought him many awards both in the UK and internationally.
In between ﬁlms, he has stood in as Head of Cinematography at the
National Film and Television School a number of times and still takes
master classes there. He was also Head of Cinematography at the
Royal College of Art. Paul regularly teaches at the New York Film
Academy in London (www.nyfa.com) as Tutor in Advanced Cinemato-
graphy and runs courses at the National Short Course Training Program
(www.nftsﬁlm-tv.ac.uk).
While still maintaining a busy shooting schedule, Paul has decided
to spend more time writing and teaching in an effort to improve the
quality of knowledge among young Directors of Photography.
Paul’s other two books, both published by Focal Press, are Digital
Cinematography and High Deﬁnition and 24P Cinematography.

Introduction
The premise I used to write this, the second edition of this book, is dif-
ferent from that I used for the ﬁrst edition.
Now I have set out my stall in the ﬁrst chapter, in which I describe
the tasks and responsibilities of the Director of Photography.The rest
of the book then tells you how to gain the skills and knowledge you
will need, one day, to get your ﬁrst job as a DP.
You may not use some of the knowledge contained herein on a day-
to-day basis on the set, but if you have it somewhere at the back of
your mind you will be a much more proﬁcient DP.
I have also been very conscious of the skills needed in the positions
leading up to the DP’s job; hence, there are chapters on focus pulling,
circles of confusion, etc. to enable you to become a very competent 1st
AC or focus puller. There are chapters on composition and related
matters to take you further on to becoming the camera operator.
Then there is all you will need regarding lighting ratios, exposure
meters and what your crew can do for you, together with chapters on
the laboratory, grading or timing and digital intermediates that will
take you ﬁnally to the DP’s position.

The Director of
Photography – an
overview
I imagine most people buying this book will have aspirations to
become a Director of Photography (DP), and therefore I will start 
the ﬁrst chapter by discussing and deﬁning the roles and tasks
required of the DP. The rest of the book will take you through the 
necessary knowledge you will need to acquire before you can use the
title DP.
The DP is the senior head of department (HOD), whose level of
responsibility and depth and breadth of tasks may only be equalled,
and then only on a very big picture, by the production designer.All the
HODs work to the director.
The prime job of the DP is to create the visual mood of the ﬁlm and
this is primarily achieved by the use and control of light. This, to my
mind, is the most exciting part of the job. Even on a simple exterior,
the DP will be making judgements that can materially affect the way
the audience will perceive the message the script,the direction and the
characters the actors are playing is interpreted.
My ﬁrm belief is that to bring the most to a movie and also to get 
the maximum enjoyment from shooting it, the DP must get the prepar-
ation right. Nothing, to me, affects the outcome more signiﬁcantly, not
even your talent.
The DP’s responsibilities
The DP will be responsible for many things and I am not going to list all
of them here. If you would like to peruse a detailed list, the American
Cinematographer gave a full and exhaustive list in their January 2003
edition and that took three pages of small type. Nevertheless, here are
the actions and responsibilities I consider most relevant and most
likely to occur; use them as a check list if you will.
3

In early pre-production
●
The ﬁrst and most important matter is to discuss, in depth and pos-
sibly on many occasions, the script with the director until you are
both in complete agreement as to the overall look of the ﬁlm.
●
In order to achieve the above, you will have had to have read the
script several times, often between your meetings with the dir-
ector.Early on,you should have made some decisions as to the ebb
and ﬂow of the emotional content of the script, so that the mood of
your photography will be sympathetic to the story needs.
●
During your discussions with the director, the production designer
will be having similar discussions and it is most important that the
DP and the production designer do not go off in different direc-
tions. Very early on, you and the production designer will need to
keep in close contact; this will necessitate some meetings with just
the two of you and some with the director present.
●
Stay in close contact with the locations department and scout, or
recce, proposed locations as early as possible.
●
If sets are to be built, then you will need to keep a close eye on the
progress of the plans, as simple changes that might mean nothing
to others can materially affect the ease with which you will be able
to light and shoot the necessary scenes.This primarily relates to the
size of the sets and their positioning within the studio.
●
If the director wishes to work with storyboards, you should keep in
close contact during their creation.A good storyboard artist can be
one of your greatest allies during pre-production. If the director
prefers not to work with a storyboard artist, perhaps through per-
sonal preference or even budgetary restraints, a storyboard from
the director, even if only drawn as stick men and women, can still
be a useful tool, especially if the director does not have the most
wonderful ‘picture’ imagination. Do not take this comment as in
any way derogatory; if that director has hired the DP for their
visual imagination knowing it will complement theirs, that DP
might very well enjoy making a more signiﬁcant contribution to
the movie in question. But remember to let the director make it
their own. Don’t tell everybody it was your idea; subtlety gets you
hired more often.
●
Come up with preliminary lighting plots as early as you can so that
you can give the lighting company an idea of what you will be
needing, and by assessing the number and type of lamps you will
need the production ofﬁce can get provisional lighting budgets
organized.
●
You will need to nominate your technical crew, as well as choose
your ﬁlm laboratory and equipment suppliers.
Close to shoot preparation
●
Approve with wardrobe department all the colours and textures
they are intending to use.
●
Check any speciﬁc make-up requirements such as prosthetics, etc.
●
Visit all sets that are still under construction together with the pro-
duction designer and the construction manager.
●
Visit sets with the production designer when construction is ﬁn-
ished to approve colours and textures.
4
Practical Cinematography

●
Work with the assistant directors to formulate workable schedules
and remind them of any scenes that are time speciﬁc due to sun
position or tides, etc.
●
Formulate your ﬁlm stock breakdowns and your Technical Diary.
See Chapter 2 as to how to do this.
●
Attend all readings, run-throughs and off-set rehearsals. These
may be the ﬁrst time you get to see your artists in the ﬂesh and
your pre-visualization, from now on, will include the faces you 
will be photographing rather than your interpretation before they
were cast.
●
Establish that your shooting crew has amassed all the equipment
you have ordered and that they are satisﬁed that their testing has
been successful.
●
Make contact with your laboratory, check who will be your daily
contact and who will be grading (timing in the US) your rushes
(dailies in the US). Your rushes or dailies are the ﬁrst print ever
struck from the camera negative and can be extraordinarily enlight-
ening, especially early on in the shooting of a movie. Establish with
your lab contact the processes you will require and ensure that
they are fully aware of the look you are going for.
●
Shoot and approve any tests you want to carry out, such as emul-
sion tests, wardrobe colour tests, make-up and prosthetics tests.
●
Finalize lighting plans and communicate them to the gaffer.
During shooting
●
Get a laboratory report as early as possible.
●
Watch the rehearsals, or block-outs, of the scene to be shot.
●
Devise and agree with the Director the shots required for the
upcoming scene.
●
Agree the most convenient shooting order with both the director
and the ﬁrst assistant director (1st AD).
●
Ensure your lighting plan has been carried out to your wishes; con-
ﬁrm the stop to the ﬁrst assistant camera (1st AC or focus puller).
●
Work with the 1st AD on background action.This may depend on
the union agreements with the background artists; it is common in
the UK that the 1st AD and the DP may direct background artists
without putting up their daily rate, but if the director gives them
instruction they will earn signiﬁcantly more for their day’s work.
Check the agreement with the production ofﬁce.
●
Give camera set-ups to your camera operator and conﬁrm these
with the director.
●
Set any additional cameras for stunts, etc.
●
At the end of each scene, conﬁrm with the director that you have
sufﬁcient and appropriate shots to have adequately covered the
scene. Advise the director as to additional shots if you think the
editor may need them.
●
Make sure that still photography and,if on set,the EPK (Electronic
Press Kit) crew have all the materials they need.This is often over-
looked, but to the DP it can be vital that all the pictures generated
on set are as good as the DP’s pictures. Bad publicity photographs,
still or moving, can seriously damage a DP’s reputation.
●
Last thing at the end of the shooting day, conﬁrm tomorrow’s
scenes with the director and the 1st AD.

●
If the director wishes, discuss tomorrow’s work.
●
Check and approve call sheets for the following day before they
are made ofﬁcial.
●
Check if any of the junior members of your crew wish to ask you
questions about the day’s shooting in order to help their career
development.
Post-production
●
Time, or grade, any early trailers that may be being constructed.
●
Check any EPKs to make sure they are of sufﬁcient technical quality.
●
Approve all effect or composite shots before they become part of
the ﬁnal cut.
●
Time, or grade, the ﬁnal cut.
●
Attend digital intermediate (DI) grade if this route has been 
chosen. For further information on DIs, see Chapter 9.
●
Approve or modify answer prints as necessary.
●
Attend all transfers to tape versions.
●
Supervise pan and scan recompositions.
●
Supervise and/or approve all other deliverables – VHS, HD, SD,
Pal versions, NTSC versions, etc.
●
Look for the next picture to shoot.

The DP’s preparation
Research
Many pictures require speciﬁc, detailed research, particularly if they
are period pieces,or if the director asks for a certain style or look.With
the run-up and preparation times currently being scheduled, however,
there is often too little time to research your subject properly.It is there-
fore useful to accumulate a store of reference material or to have a
good idea where such material can be found. This can help not just
with preparing for a shoot, but also with an initial interview for a pic-
ture. Discussing a script you only received 24 hours earlier with a
director who has been living with it for months can be a lot easier if
you have an understanding of the script’s context and can knowledge-
ably refer to images that relate to that script.
Regular visits to second-hand bookstores can provide a useful
library of old picture books at very little cost. Several years before I
needed them, I acquired a marvellous set of books covering the years
of the Second World War almost entirely comprising of photographs
taken at the time with minimal captions; there is a book for each year.
Some ﬁve or so years later, I was asked to shoot a picture which
opened with men in a train returning from the Dieppe raid of 1942
with ﬂashbacks of the men being rescued from the waters along the
French coast. My set of books provided pictures of men actually in oil-
covered water being picked out of a life raft after that raid, a picture of
a woman waiting for a train containing survivors of that raid and one
of people using an underground station as a bomb shelter. All these
scenes were scenes in the script I had been offered and I was able to
base my interpretation of the script on them.
While it is the DP’s job to interpret the script and the director’s
vision of that script,it is an immense help if you can base your imagined
pictures on reality – it brings a greater believability to the ﬁnished ﬁlm.
Old photographic books are useful (as well as quite fun) to collect,as
are books of fashion photographs. With old photographs it is often as
useful to imagine why the picture is shot and styled in a certain way,
as this puts one’s thinking into the mind of the original photographer
and you can begin to feel more of the mood of the times.

Practical Cinematography
Nowadays, there are even books published on speciﬁc times. I have 
an excellent book, The Golden Years, a celebration of an Edwardian
summer – I haven’t made the ﬁlm to go with it yet but its time will come.
Art books are a favourite starting point, especially of directors.
When we made the BBC ﬁlm The Dark Angel based on the book
Uncle Silas by Sheridan Fenau, the director, during pre-production,
showed me many pictures of Victorian paintings as references for vari-
ous scenes. Once the shoot started, he preferred not to show me any
photocopies of reference pictures he had in his script, as he did not
want to inhibit my original thinking at that stage.
While touching on the subject of photocopying, it is important to be
aware of the copyright on the original, be it pictures or words. Most
large companies have bought a buy-out licence for limited copying,
but if either they or you don’t have legal access to the material you
may ﬁnd yourself in trouble.
The painter I, and I imagine all cinematographers, get asked to 
emulate most is Vermeer. Not easy, but it can be done. I was once
asked for a Frans Hals look, but persuaded the director against that
because the ﬁlm was destined for television and there would have
been so much black on the screen the actors might have become
unrecognizable. Frans Hals’ pictures require contemplation and tele-
vision cutting rates give no time for that. Suggesting we shot another
movie with reference to Edward Hopper was a brave move but I think
we pulled it off. One very large lamp to give a single, crisp, shadow
across the set and a light overall ﬁll, together with careful location
ﬁnding, was a good start. I just pray nobody ever asks for a Jackson
Pollock!
Making up your own scrapbooks is an excellent way to accumulate
images and enables you to add pictures from newspapers and maga-
zines to your collection. Keep faces, buildings, events and all the rest 
in separate scrapbooks to enable easy reference. The very nature of
these books is random, as pictures will be added in acquisition order,
but this offers a deﬁnite advantage for, when I am stuck for an image
to work from, just ﬂicking through a couple of scrapbooks will as often
as not start my mind off down an interesting path – not necessarily
from a particular picture, but somehow the randomness ﬁres up ideas
and unlocks my visual imagination.
Preparing for a shoot
The recces or scouting
The recce, the English colloquial abbreviation for reconnoitre, or
scouting as Americans call it, comes in two parts. Recceing with the
director and/or the location manager some time prior to principal
photography is usually productive and enjoyable.The technical recce,
which usually occurs just a week or two before the shoot commences,
where the DP has to ﬁnalize all the technical requirements, is usually
straightforward hard work.
Recceing with the director and other department heads is a most 
creative process. It is the time, if you haven’t worked together before, to
get to know each other and understand each other’s visualization of 
the ﬁlm.At this stage there is often,still,a choice of some of the locations

to be used and making the decisions together, helped by the location
manager, is a valuable investment in the look of the ﬁlm.
There will be much discussion on a director’s recce as to costs and
facilities needed for the various scenes. One should make the director
aware of scenes that may require out of the ordinary equipment or
labour. It is not uncommon for the director and the DP to discuss the
value to the story of individual scenes as this relates to their costs, and
make sure they are spending the budget on the important scenes
rather than, as can happen, ﬁnd they are spending huge amounts of
cash to solve problems on scenes that do not necessarily warrant that
investment.
Only when you have seen the primary locations can you start to put
the images together in your mind. I often ask for photocopies of the
leading actors’ publicity photographs before the recce, so that I can
put faces into the rooms and spaces.
I ﬁnd the technical recce perhaps the hardest and most intense part
of the ﬁlm-making process, for in just a few days I must ﬁnalize all the
technical requirements, agree with my gaffer as to the logistics of
every location and ensure that all the equipment suppliers, and the
production ofﬁce, are aware of the call-off of equipment for the next
several weeks.
All the other departments will be bringing you their problems,
where they impact on your own, during these few days. Decisions
made now must be of the highest quality, as a poor judgement now will
come back to haunt you in several weeks’ time.
It is for these reasons that I make the most thorough preparations
and produce the lists discussed below.
The DP’s preparation
As schedules get tighter and budgets decrease,perhaps the most effect-
ive way a cinematographer can reclaim lighting time on the set is to
invest time in preparation. Without good preparation, too much time
on set will be spent answering unnecessary questions and trying to
steal time to make arrangements for upcoming shooting days, which
are not, as yet, fully organized. Thus, with good preparation, a DP’s
time can be better deployed.
The most effective way of releasing time is to publish, before the
ﬁrst day of principal photography, a series of documents that allow
anyone connected with the necessary arrangements to quickly, and
easily, refer to the DP’s requirements and make their contribution
without further reference to the cinematographer.
Two things need to happen for this to be without trauma and to be
effective. Firstly, the cinematographer has to give the time to the pro-
ject. Secondly, they have to have a system in place to produce the docu-
mentation efﬁciently.
If you are comfortable using a computer, then things are easier. One
thing computers are exceptionally good at is repeat business. Once
you have generated a list they seem to positively revel in your ability
to make changes to that list and to deliver a new version very quickly.
My greatest ally in this important area of efﬁciency is a palmtop 
or laptop computer. I used to use a Psion but these are no longer
made, so now I store all my contacts, which at the last count numbered
The DP’s preparation

nearly 500, in my Palm and do all the lists and data for the shoot on a
Toshiba laptop, which is powerful enough to be my main computer. I
don’t own a desktop.A modern laptop is all I need these days; indeed,
this and my other two books were all written on a series of Toshibas,
including the making of all the illustrations. Both my Palm and my
Toshiba contain all this, together with an enormous database of just
about every technician with whom I have ever worked.
Three words of warning: if you decide to work up your data for a
picture on a laptop, make regular backups. I know it seems obvious
but it is essential. Also, make sure the computer is insured; unfortu-
nately, it is almost impossible to get insurance on the data contained
on the hard drive so, again, it is your responsibility to make those
backups. The production you are currently working on may be kind
enough to cover it, but it is best to have your own insurance for, if not,
fate may just decide it is going missing the day after you come off the
company insurance.
If you do not want to use a computer, the alternative is to use a
check-box list. Here you carefully write out your lists with just about
everything you could possibly ever need on any production with a
check-box against every entry. For each new production, you photo-
copy your original list and then just mark the items you require on this
occasion.
There are four publications I provide the production with, all serv-
ing a different purpose:
1
The camera equipment list
2
The lighting equipment list
3
The ﬁlm stock breakdown
4
The technical schedule.
In order to discuss the use, importance and preparation of these docu-
ments, I will refer to just one ﬁlm, Neville’s Island, a feature-length ﬁlm
shot in England for prime-time television transmission. This format
contains most of the problems associated with any ﬁlm production. It
is also valuable that all the lists come from the same production for,
in many ways, they are interrelated.
The camera equipment list
The camera equipment list will probably be published twice. The line
producer, or production manager, will usually ask the DP early on in
the production run-up for a guess, or wish list, of the equipment that
will be required as the basic kit in order to get competitive quotes
from different suppliers. This does not take away the DP’s right to
nominate a preferred supplier.
It is important that this list is reasonable and not an ‘if only I could
have’ list. At this stage of pre-production, one does not want to
frighten the budget controllers with a foolish amount of equipment. It
is more important to list a reasonable kit in order that comparative
estimates of different suppliers’ prices may be obtained.
Once the supplier has been chosen, the recce is over and a basic list
can be decided upon, it is vital that you provide this new list as soon as
possible.This is not only so that a ﬁrm quote can be obtained, but also,
more important to the DP, to ensure that the chosen supplier can
deliver all their requirements or, if they need to subcontract some
10

equipment, they then have sufﬁcient time to make the necessary
arrangements.
Figure 2.1 shows copies of the camera equipment list as delivered to
the production ofﬁce of Neville’s Island just after the technical recce.
Not only is all the equipment very accurately detailed, but the
assumed supplier is noted as these may differ for various parts of the
kit. Each section is quite clearly marked and short-term hire, such as
the second camera body for the time spent away from London, is
clearly indicated.
This accuracy is important, as it is quite possible that someone in the
production ofﬁce may have to book the equipment while all the
informed staff are out of the ofﬁce. It is only fair to them that you have
produced a list that can be read down a phone by someone who knows
little about camera equipment.This is not only a kindness to them, but
an insurance policy for the DP.
In addition, the page number and the full number of pages are
clearly shown in the bottom right-hand corner of the page, and in the
top right-hand corner the publication date is shown – this is very
important. The DP will quite likely deliver a number of updated ver-
sions of the camera equipment list as the production nears the ﬁrst day
of principal photography. It is very important that anyone on the pro-
duction who needs to refer to the list can easily see which is the latest
version.
The camera equipment list, as illustrated, is exactly as written in my
computer.These days computers are pretty compatible, so you should
be able to plug into any ofﬁce printer if you don’t want the bother of
carrying a small, portable, one. The DP can return from a recce and,
say over lunch, print out various lists, etc. in order to have them ready
for an after-lunch production meeting. This kind of organization is
very much appreciated by the production.
The lighting equipment list
As with the camera list, in all probability the production ofﬁce will
need an early lighting equipment list in order to obtain comparative
costings from differing suppliers. Unlike the camera list, where a close
guess of the requirements can be made from reading the script, with
the lighting list it is very difﬁcult to give a reasonably accurate judge-
ment of one’s needs before having seen all the locations; nevertheless,
a list to base budgets upon will be requested.
My gaffer and I usually solve this by offering a list from a previous
ﬁlm that had a similar script and schedule – this at least provides a
starting point.This provisional list only needs to contain the lamps and
will look roughly like the ﬁrst page of Figure 2.2, but without the ﬁlters
and consumables. The suppliers will be able to give a rough estimate
from this, as all the accessories are fairly standard.
During the recce, my gaffer and I will be continually updating the
list of the lighting equipment we will need to carry as the standard kit,
together with a daily extras list that will eventually become part of the
technical schedule described later in this chapter.
As soon as the technical recce is complete, my gaffer and I will 
sit down with my laptop and compile the full list of all the lighting
equipment he will require. As I can never remember all the bits and
pieces he likes to have, we will either modify a previous list of an

earlier production, or if the list required is radically different, he will
simply dictate the new list to me and I will type it into the computer.
This results in a list as shown in Figure 2.2, which shows the actual list
used on my example ﬁlm Neville’s Island.
We then either fax this to the production ofﬁce or deliver it the fol-
lowing morning.A copy is usually also sent directly to the lighting sup-
plier. Some urgency is required at this time, as one is usually only a few
days away from principal photography by the time the last location
has been recced; ﬁnal budgets need to be agreed and the supplier
needs to make sure that all the equipment on the list will be ready and
on the lighting truck.
Requirements for the generator and lighting equipment truck do
not go on the lighting list. My gaffer makes these arrangements
directly with the lighting company.The same applies to cherry pickers
and towers; these will appear on the technical schedule together with
any equipment required on a daily basis.
The ﬁlm stock breakdown
Not long before ﬁlming starts, the DP will be asked what ﬁlm stocks
they will be using and what quantities they estimate they will use of
each stock.I have found a simple and accurate way of doing this.If you
refer to Figure 2.3 you can see the layout I use.Again,this is on my lap-
top using Microsoft Excel. The list is made in scene number order
with,for my own reference,day or night,interior or exterior and a very
brief description of the scene as a reminder.Then comes a column for
the ﬁlters I expect to use and ﬁnally a column for each type of ﬁlm
stock I intend to use.
The ﬁlm stock is shown as a ﬁgure which represents a decimal num-
ber of the length of the scene as obtained from a page count of the
shooting script. So, for instance, halfway down the ﬁrst page of Figure
2.3 you will ﬁnd scene 11a, which is shown as being 5.3 pages long. A
little further down, scene 21 is shown as only 0.8 pages long. By using
decimals, in preference to fractions, it is easy to get the computer pro-
gram to do all the arithmetic at the end of the lists.
At the bottom of the second page of Figure 2.3 you can see how the
ﬁnal amounts of ﬁlm estimated to be required are arrived at. Firstly,
one adds up each column of page counts. In this instance, 72.2 pages
will be shot on Kodak Vision 200T and 36.8 pages will be shot on
Kodak Vision 320T. Simple arithmetic will relate the total number of
pages to the running time of the ﬁlm; this is multiplied by the pro-
ducer’s estimate of the shooting ratio they have put in the production
budget. By relating, proportionally, the page counts to the total rolls
you expect to use, you come up with the number of rolls you will need
for the whole production.
A copy of the stock breakdown is also put in the camera truck so
that the focus puller and the loader can refer to the day’s scenes and
know which ﬁlters and stock the DP is expecting to use. The camera
then comes on to the set with a 99 per cent chance of being loaded and
set up correctly.
On a long production it is unusual to have all your stock delivered at
the beginning of the production.The ﬁlm can be kept in ideal conditions
at the manufacturers and, if they know your estimated requirements,

RETURN GEAR & WRAP – not scheduled by production

Figure 2.4 continued

your full order of just one batch number for each type of ﬁlm can be put
aside in their fridge and delivered to your production ofﬁce on a weekly
basis.This helps keep the ﬁlm stock in prime condition.
The technical schedule
Using almost any diary program on your computer you can generate a
very accurate daily list of all your requirements for the whole of a ﬁlm.
Figure 2.4 shows the technical schedule for the whole of the Neville’s
Island shoot. Before going on a recce, enter ‘Camera: Normal Kit’ and
‘Lighting: Normal Kit’ on all the shooting days. Then, enter your days
off so that they show on the agenda; this gives you an entry for every
day of the whole shooting period. Now, referring to the production’s
draft schedule, enter the scene numbers you are going to shoot on all
the given dates.
Having prepared your agenda in this way as you go round the loca-
tions on the technical recce, all you have to enter are the changes from
the normal kit.
Publish this technical schedule as widely as possible and as soon
after the last recce as is humanly possible. Apart from having saved
the ﬁrst assistant director and the line producer a lot of effort, you
have now made it possible for the production ofﬁce, should location
dates change,to easily track your extra requirements just by looking at
the old date, seeing which scene number the equipment relates to, and
posting the requirements to wherever the scenes move to in the new
schedule as planning progresses.
By producing this kind of technical schedule you make it easy for
the ofﬁce to keep the production on track and you have created a situ-
ation whereby you will be bothered far less on the set as things change.
Hence you get more time to do what you really enjoy – shooting the
movie!
You might like to read Figure 2.4 bearing in mind the kind of story it
might have been. Monday 20 October includes camera splash bag, sec-
ond camera for ﬁreworks and CAMERA SAFETY BOAT together
with, on Monday 3 November, CHERRY PICKER bucket to be
draped to be ‘Helicopter’. It was a very interesting picture to shoot!
The DP’s preparation

The camera crew
An overview
Before a camera crew is formed for any production, the DP will prob-
ably have had an interview with the director and the producer.
Particularly in television, it is quite normal for them to interview per-
haps three DPs before making their choice, even if there was a clear
favourite right at the beginning. It is a fortunate DP who is well known
enough to the director and producer to be asked to shoot their ﬁlm
without having to be interviewed.
Once the DP is conﬁrmed they will start to look for their operator.
Most DPs have a preferred operator with a second choice in mind 
in case the ﬁrst is already booked on another production. It is quite
acceptable for the director to have a signiﬁcant input into the choice
of operator as, in the UK at least, the director will often work very
closely with the operator to choose and set up the shots. In America 
it is equally common for the operator to work solely with the DP.The
DP will, if this is the director’s preferred way of working, most prob-
ably have had several meetings with the director and design depart-
ment to set the overall look of the ﬁlm, and as the director and DP
often travel together on an away job there is plenty of time for them
to discuss ﬁner points before they reach the set. If they are not travel-
ling together it is usual to have a discussion about the next day at the
end of the day’s shooting or, if the director doesn’t want to commit
themselves, ﬁrst thing in the morning, perhaps at breakfast.
Once the operator has been chosen they will be asked to nominate
a focus puller and clapper loader. These appointments will always
require the approval of the DP,the producer and probably the director.
The camera crew works in a very supportive way – that is, each
grade is only as good as the support they receive from the colleague
around them. The individual crew responsibilities from the trainee
through to the DP are therefore as follows.
The trainee
Many years ago it was common to have a trainee on the crew.
Restrictions to budget and the collapse of both the studio system 
24

The camera crew
25
and large television stations then caused producers to be very reluc-
tant to sanction the very small costs of having a trainee. Things have
now improved for trainees for the curious reason that most directors
now wish to work with video assist, and that facility comes with bat-
teries, cables, monitor stands, etc. Providing the director does not want
to record the video image, in which case a trained video technician is
the answer, most producers now see the trainee as an economical way
of having the video assist organized and kept running.
This is all very good news. I am currently working with two clapper
loaders who started on my crews as trainees looking after the video
assist.At least one end of the cable is attached to the camera and that
ensures that a good and willing trainee will get much advice from the
shooting crew. Keeping the shooting crew fed with tea, coffee and
snacks is a marvellous way of ensuring they hire you next time. One of
my loaders, when my trainee, somehow found time to run an espresso
coffee machine two or three times a day. Adding the director to the
camera crew as people he was happy to provide this service to has
ensured a very successful transition to the next grade.
Recently, some clever person invented a marvellous device to help
the trainee or clapper loader with the tea transportation problem – the
‘cup bat’. Figure 3.1 shows this wonderful invention. It is made from
half-inch-thick MDF or plywood.The unit carpenter,if talked to nicely,
will usually happily make you one in a free moment.The holes are just
the right size for a polystyrene cup to sit in and still sit about an inch
proud of the surface.Kept in the set box if the trainee is busy,any mem-
ber of the crew can grab it in a spare moment and get the camera crew
a cup of tea. If we are shooting exteriors where I, as DP, am not always
that busy,I am quite happy to grab the cup bat and do a tea run.The bat
has nine holes:I can use one cup for sugar and a spoon and,having kept
a cup for myself, endear myself to seven others on the shooting crew.
Including the director and continuity in a tea run is a welcome gesture
from the camera department.
The clapper loader (AC2 or 2nd AC)
From the focus puller’s point of view, the most important part of the
loader’s job is to bring them just about every part of the camera they
Figure 3.1 The cup bat

may need during the shooting day. The focus puller must never leave
the camera, so the loader could be thought of as the legs of the focus
puller. A good loader will have the camera car, or truck (in the UK
even a seven-ton truck will usually be referred to as the camera car)
very neatly organized with everything in its place and always in the
same place so that it can be found quickly, even in the dark.
A good loader will learn to anticipate which pieces of equipment
will be needed and when they will be needed; they will then be able to
be standing by with all the parts needed before they are asked.
Magazines will be adjacent as and when the camera is close to needing
reloading and will be loaded with an appropriate ﬁlm stock. All this
must be done without cluttering the set; it is not an acceptable solution
to have everything that might be needed very close to the camera.Too
many people will get cross at continually tripping over the camera
boxes and if you are working outdoors then the slightest amount of
rain will cause dreadful panic as equipment is put away. Good antici-
pation is essential to being a successful loader.
These days, it is the loader’s job to put marks on the ﬂoor, usually
with different coloured camera tape, for both the artists’ sake and the
focus puller’s, these marks not necessarily being for the same purpose.
It is a good idea to dedicate a colour to each artist. A very useful
gadget is a ‘tape stick’, as shown in Figure 3.2, this being a hexagonal
piece of wood with a round handle on the end. Each face of the hexa-
gon will have pre-prepared strips of camera tape stuck on top of each
other, one face for each colour. If you fold back about one inch of each
piece of tape, they will be easy to pull off in a hurry.
It is a good idea for the loader to have a single bag or box close to
camera with just the small bits they will need together with the report
sheets, so that any spare moment can be used to keep up to date with-
out leaving the set. This box or bag can also be used to hold the clap-
perboard, the cup bat, the mark stick, etc. For interiors and guaranteed
dry days, most loaders seem to have prevailed on a unit carpenter to
make them a divided set box, as illustrated in Figure 3.3.This can be of
any size, but I recently saw one made to ﬁt exactly on a Magliner trol-
ley the crew were using to bring essential kit closer to the set – very
impressive.
If cleanliness is next to godliness, then all good loaders would
deserve to go to Heaven. The inside of the changing bag or, on a big
picture, the darkroom, which may be in the camera truck, should be
immaculately clean and should be cleaned several times a day.
We have all seen a hair in the gate, shown on a lab report as an HIG.
That little image, actually the shadow of a hair-like object, waving at us
from the edge of the screen makes the shot unusable.Some hairs come
with the ﬁlm and are the product of the slitting, or sciving, process.
Film is made in wide rolls and, after coating with the photographic
emulsion, is slit into the required width – for motion picture negative
16mm, 35mm or 65mm.
Any cutting process produces swarf – this is ﬁne strands of the
material being cut. In the case of ﬁlm the base plastic cuts very cleanly,
the emulsion itself not so well.Therefore, our hairs are sometimes ﬁne
pieces of emulsion swarf. In the manufacturing process great care is
taken to reduce this problem to a minimum and vacuum removal
processes are employed at every stage but, such is the nature of things,
occasionally some hairs get through.

Figure 3.3 The set box

Because the ﬁlm sometimes arrives at the loader’s bag or darkroom
carrying its little supply of hairs,loaders must be continually vigilant in
their photographic housework. It has been known for a senior mem-
ber of the camera crew, when passing the loader’s bag, to turn it inside
out and see how clean the corners are. It is no use them claiming they
were going to clean it – it should have been clean. If, after a couple of
inspections at the beginning of the picture, all is well and there are
very few hairs appearing, then the loader will be left in peace.
Perhaps the most important responsibility of the loader is the paper-
work. It is boring, but if the camera report sheet is not both legible and
accurate it will be impossible to ﬁnd the appropriate piece of negative
come neg. cutting. Also, on most pictures the production ofﬁce will be
keeping a very close eye on the daily camera report sheets. This is for
several reasons. The shot footage must be logged to see if the produc-
tion is on budget in this area and they will want to know how much
footage is being entered in the waste column. A reputation for good
paperwork is the most common reason for a production ofﬁce to
approve the DP’s nomination of a clapper loader. My loader keeps all
the information regarding the lens,exposure,ﬁlters,etc.very neatly in a
little book similar to a policeman’s notebook. Should I need to refer
back to any set-up, he then has the notes for the whole picture in his
back pocket – very efﬁcient.They also keep the notes on ﬁlters and the
like to a minimum on the report sheet; this way, my techniques for
achieving certain effects are not broadcast to too great an audience.
Most DPs like to keep their ways of doing things within the crew, at
least until the picture has been released.
At the end of every day the loader should check with the DP to see
if there are any special notes they want entered on the laboratory
report sheet.A typical, blank, report sheet is shown in Figure 3.4.
On a 35mm picture it is the perceived wisdom in the production
ofﬁce that good loaders can save their salaries by intelligent juggling
of which magazines are put on the camera when and thus reduce the
amount of wasted ﬁlm stock.A loader who is efﬁcient in this area gets
hired again.
The clapper part of the job is deceptively simple. I am appalled at
how often a clapperboard is unreadable. It is vital that all the relevant
information is on the clapperboard and that it is easily read. If you
have ever tried to check the slate on a very blurred board that has
started to leave the frame just before the clap is closed you will under-
stand why.
Not only should the clapperboard be neat, but it must be put on ﬁlm
in the correct way.The board should be held very still as the clap stick
is brought down and should then be held still for half a second after
the clap; only then should it be removed. This will give the cutting
room 12 frames of perfectly sharp board after the clap, which makes
synching up the sound and picture very much easier. There is also a
correct way of putting on a mute, or silent, board.The board should be
held by the stick with the stick open and the board should be held only
by this hand.This shows the cutting room that it is a mute shot as only
an idiot would now clap the board on their own ﬁngers.
Once, clapperboards were made wholly of wood, originally using
chalk numbers, hence often being referred to as the slate, and later util-
izing plastic numbers attached with Velcro. Almost universally these
days, a board known as a backlight board is used and these are a vast

improvement. The stick and an equivalent thickness on the board are
still of wooden construction,but the whole of the information section of
the board is made from a sheet of opaque, white, acrylic sheet.This has
the huge advantage of being capable of illumination from in front or
behind. The simple expedient of putting waterproof sellotape on the
Production/Director sections, writing on them with pental and then
covering them with a second coat of sellotape makes the writing per-
manent for the duration of the shoot and is still easily removable before
the next production. White board wipable markers are used for Roll,
Slate and Take. Figure 3.5 shows a typical layout for a backlight board.
Very often, the only way a production judges a clapper loader is by
their report sheets and the state of the clapperboard. It is not at all
uncommon for a loader to get the chance to work up to focus puller
simply on the strength of the immaculate clapperboard the producer
has seen every morning at rushes.If there are no hairs in the gate,what
else does the producer see of the loader’s work?
If there is no trainee on the crew, the loader often brings the camera
crew tea and coffee. The DP, the operator and the focus puller can
rarely leave the set. Someone has to bring them their tea or they won’t
get any – so it’s the loader or trainee’s job.
If you are a loader and you want promotion, be clean and tidy, make
up legible, well-written clapperboards and have immaculate report
sheets.
It is sometimes the loader’s job to negotiate with the production
ofﬁce for expenses and touchy matters like extra money for running a
second camera. Great tact is required here, as you can easily fall out
with the camera crew and the production ofﬁce all at the same time.
This is clearly not a good plan.

The focus puller (AC1 or 1st AC)
Keeping the main action sharp is the prime responsibility of the focus
puller. In addition, they are the one most concerned with the camera
itself. It is their task to build the camera each morning and to put it
away at the ﬁnish of shooting.They must keep it and the lenses scrupu-
lously clean. They must carry out any front-line maintenance on the
camera and its associated kit.
Keeping the main action sharp is done, in the main, by using a tape
measure, after which the depth of ﬁeld is calculated using a Kelly cal-
culator, Samcine calculator or depth of ﬁeld charts (see Chapter 16 for
an explanation of this). It takes a great deal of talent and experience to
become a good focus puller, and a ﬁne understanding of exactly what
the audience will be looking at at any given moment during a scene.
Currently, there is a trend for focus pullers to use infrared range
ﬁnders.They are very accurate if used with skill. My worry about these
devices is that although many of them say they are perfectly safe, we
are in a litigious society. Let us suppose the focus puller had put the
infrared dot on the forehead of a major star and within a few months
that star developed any kind of eye problem – would you want to be in
court as the defendant? I would not. Let’s stick to the tape – unless we
have monumental insurance.
When shooting with lenses with very long focal lengths the focus
puller may decide to take an eye focus – that is, focusing the lens
through the viewﬁnder. This is because, with long focus lenses, a very
small movement of the focus barrel of the lens may move the plane of
focus quite a long way into the set. Before taking an eye focus it is
important to know how to set the focus on the eyepiece. First, you rack
the focus to a distance which puts the image as out of focus as can pos-
sibly be achieved. You then focus the viewﬁnder on the cross in the
middle of the viewﬁnder. If you now refocus the lens you will have
perfect focus.
There is an old trick for obtaining perfect focus that works better in
some viewﬁnders than others. Having obtained what you believe to be
a perfectly sharp image, immediately behind the cross in the centre of
the viewﬁnder rock your eye very slightly from side to side. If you are
in perfect focus the cross and the image will appear to move together.
If you can see any apparent movement between the cross and the
image you are not in perfect focus.This is known as parallax focusing,
because if you see movement there is a parallax error between the
plane of focus of the image and the plane of the cross on the focusing
screen. When the image is perfectly formed on the focusing screen,
and is therefore sharp, there will be no difference in the position of the
image and the cross engraved on the screen and therefore no parallax
error.
There are many tricks of the trade and good focus pullers are worth
their weight in gold, quite literally, for if the focus puller is ﬁrst class
then the DP may choose to light to a wider aperture and thereby save the
production a considerable sum on the lighting budget.
The focus puller is responsible for setting the stop on the lens as
directed by the DP.
The focus puller rarely leaves the camera.The operator must be free
to go off with the director and the DP to recce the coming set-ups, etc.
The loader will bring the focus puller the bits of kit needed to build the
30
Practical Cinematography

camera for the next shot. You could say that, during the shooting day,
the camera belongs to the focus puller.
At the end of every printed take the focus puller will check the gate
for any hairs or scratches. If all is well, they will then give whoever is
on continuity the details of the shot. This will include the focal length
of the lens, the focus setting and the stop. On some crews the loader
does this, especially if they are keeping very full notes for themselves
or the DP; my loader does this for me.
The camera operator
The duties of the operator may seem self-evident, but have you
thought of the many different ways that the operator may be asked
to interact with the director, the DP, the rest of the crew and often 
continuity?
It is common in the UK for a director, after giving initial guidance 
to the DP and usually in the presence of the operator, to leave the DP
to their own devices and to work very closely with the operator. In
America, most often, the director only talks to the DP; the DP then
directs the operator.
Vital to the relationship between the DP, the operator and the dir-
ector, in the UK way of working, is the ability of the operator to feed
back to the DP updates of the director’s requirements, which may
have happened while the DP was lighting the current set or away pre-
lighting another.
When setting camera ﬂags for backlights, etc., the operator must be
certain that they are not ﬂagging off light important to the DP’s vision
of the scene. A continual dialogue between these two most important
technicians is imperative. In the UK, the DP or the gaffer sets the ﬂags,
in the USA it’s the grip’s job.
The operator is usually nominated by the DP, but this is a nomin-
ation that must always be cleared with the production ofﬁce. Many
directors are as concerned to hire the most appropriate operator as the
right DP. It sometimes happens that the director will nominate the
operator and ask the DP’s approval.As you will appreciate, for a DP to
have a regular and admired operator can be an advantage to everyone.
While the operator is responsible for all the camera movements
during the shot, they are not responsible for the physical movement of
the camera between shots.This falls to the team of focus puller, loader
and grip. During a shot the travelling movement of the camera is the
responsibility of the grip, working under the direction of the operator.
The Director of Photography
Although I started this book with a more detailed description of the
DP’s role, I am including here a more general view on the craft in
order to see the DP’s responsibilities within the overall concept of the
camera crew.
The primary responsibility of the DP is to create the mood and feel
of the picture with their lighting. Depending on the style of the dir-
ector,you may be left to decide the look of the ﬁlm for yourself or,after
meetings with the director and, usually, art department, you may then
The camera crew
31

be left to light the set as you see ﬁt. Alternatively, the director may
have very ﬁrm ideas as to how the ﬁlm should look and it will be the
DP’s task to fulﬁl these wishes.All these different ways of working are
just as enjoyable; a little guidance on the set is very fulﬁlling, but work-
ing to a director’s wishes and giving what is wanted, and hopefully
more, brings much praise and loyalty from the director.
As the senior head of department, the DP is looked to to set an
example to the rest of the unit. It is often the personal style of the cine-
matographer that will get further work just as much as the quality of
the photography.Time keeping, crew behaviour, dress and manners all
come, at least in part, from the DP and so they set the standard for the
professional approach of the crew.
DPs are responsible for all matters pertaining to the photography of
the ﬁlm – lighting, exposure, composition, cleanliness, etc. are all, ultim-
ately, their responsibility. DPs will more often than not nominate the
crew – that is, they will have put into the production ofﬁce a list of ﬁrst
choice and second choice people to be offered the job. If a crew mem-
ber is nominated by the DP, then the DP is responsible for them and
will in all probability have to decide whether they are to be ﬁred if
they are not up to the required standard.The upside of this is that DPs
usually get the crews they want.
It should be said that it is quite common these days for the DP’s
contract to include the requirement to provide a ‘full negative’. This
means that underexposure as a route to providing a certain look is
unacceptable to the production. You may ﬁnd this offensive or
restricting, but I am afraid that many producers have had a consider-
able amount of trouble producing ﬁrst-class release prints.Though the
rushes may look excellent, cinema release prints are usually made
from internegatives, as the original negative is far too precious to use
for ﬁnal printing of the large quantity of prints needed by the distribu-
tor (see Chapter 8). It is very difﬁcult to make a satisfactory inter-
negative from a thin or underexposed camera negative.
It is not at all uncommon for an appreciable part of the production’s
budget to come from pre-selling the video rights. A full negative is
vital in these circumstances, as the telecine machines used to make the
master tape are very intolerant of a thin negative.
I am including all this because cinematographers should get used to
producing a correctly exposed negative – bad habits formed early may
lead to considerable periods of unemployment later.
The grip or dolly grip
The grip is primarily responsible for the camera dolly and all the
movements made by it. They are also responsible for moving the tri-
pod to the next set-up; the focus puller will usually take the camera.
Never move a camera while it is still on the tripod. I have seen one fall
off in these circumstances – not a pretty sight and very embarrassing.
The grip is responsible for building, or supervising the building of,
any construction needed to support the track or boards the dolly is
going to run on. The levelling and smoothness of the dolly’s working
surface is vital to the success of a dolly shot.
Front-line maintenance of the dolly and its kit are down to the grip.
Very often, they will have built or had built many special bits to enable
32
Practical Cinematography

them to ﬁx a camera to almost any object. A good and experienced
grip’s van is an Aladdin’s cave.
The gaffer
The gaffer is the chief electrician and works directly for the DP. Some
DPs will set their own ﬂags and barn doors and some won’t – it just
depends on how they like to work together.Very often, the DP will be
closer to his gaffer than any other member of the crew. They are vital
to his success.
It is said that one very well known and much respected American
DP, when asked by a student what was the single most important thing
they could do to improve their photography, replied ‘hire the best
gaffer you can afford, even if you have to give them part of your fee’.
I must say I agree with that advice.
The best boy is simply the gaffer’s best boy. On a large crew, the
gaffer will plot the cable runs and how to ﬁx and support the lamps –
it’s the best boy’s job to organize the lighting crew and actually move
and ﬁx the lamps. On most small units, say three sparks in total, the
gaffer acts as his own best boy.
My gaffer and I do most of the tweaking between us,unless it is a big
set where I leave it entirely to my gaffer and his best boy. My regular
gaffer is so good and understands lighting so well that I will often ask
him to light simple set-ups without me there and without a plot. I just
have to give him an idea of how I want the artists to look and the
mood of the scene, perhaps adding where a main key light should be.
On larger set-ups, I give him a ﬂoor plan of the set with all the main
lamps marked on it; this is then known as the lighting plot, and often
he will have to go off with this and put in a very big pre-light without
me, as I need to stay with the principal artists.
Crew protocol
On any ﬁlm set, the camera crew always arrive at least half an hour
before the call on the call sheet.The camera will be built and ready on
the tripod or dolly before the call time and will be positioned roughly
where the ﬁrst shot of the day is expected. Breakfast is usually taken
after the camera is prepared. It will not be taken after the call; if you
arrive too late for breakfast, tough, the camera comes ﬁrst. It is your
responsibility to be on time. More technicians lose work through bad
timekeeping than anything else, so don’t be late – be half an hour early
and get into the habit.
On a feature ﬁlm, it is traditional for all the other technicians to call
the DP and the director ‘Sir’; the DP very often calls the director ‘Sir’ as
well, perhaps because in the ﬁrst few days he can’t remember their
name and the habit just sticks. You may not approve but you may also
get ﬁred if you don’t. If ‘Sir’ has become your habit, then working with
lady directors or DPs can cause embarrassment; wait and see what they
seem to prefer.I know one lady director who likes to be called ‘Skipper’,
but I wouldn’t try that unless you are very, very sure she will like it.
If you show respect to others you are likely to receive it in return –
ﬁlm sets are not unlike the rest of life.

The motion picture
camera
Man has been beguiled by the movies for over a century now.One rea-
son might be that it takes a disarmingly simple piece of equipment, the
motion picture camera, to record images from the most fertile of our
imaginations.
In essence, a motion picture camera is a couple of boxes, one with a
lens on the front and a mechanism inside capable of dragging a length
of ﬁlm down a speciﬁc distance at least 16 times a second, and the
other containing a suitable length of ﬁlm to feed the mechanism with
space remaining to take up the ﬁlm after exposure.
When the pictures from this device are projected by a similar mech-
anism they give a valid representation of the original scene, with all the
movements contained therein correctly displayed in a realistic way.
The persistence of vision
Producing moving images from a length of still pictures relies on what
might be considered an aberration in the process of human vision. If
an image is ﬂashed upon the retina of the eye the person sees that
image, brieﬂy, in its entirety and then, over a short period, the image
stays with the person while growing fainter or decaying. If a second
image is ﬂashed on the retina, soon enough the person will see the two
images as a continuous image without the ﬁrst ﬂash.
If there is movement in the interval between the ﬂashing of the
images, the brain will perceive the difference between the two images
as continuous movement providing the time gap between the two
images is short enough. If a continuous stream of images is ﬂashed
upon the retina in a quick enough succession, then the person will per-
ceive no ﬂashing effects and will perceive the images as a continuous,
smooth motion.
The rate of image ﬂashing at which the eye starts to perceive motion
is around ten ﬂashes per second, though at this rate a ﬂickering effect
will be very noticeable. Only at around 16 or 18 new images per second
37

does the movement become truly believable, as continuous motion
and the ﬂickering effect reduce to the point where it can be ignored.
Figure 4.1 shows a series of images as they decay, represented by the
vertical frames, and the frequency with which the images must be
replaced for the observer to believe that they are seeing a smooth,
continuous motion, represented by the horizontal frames.
Frame rates
At the turn of the century, a taking frame rate of 16 frames per second
(fps) was becoming common practice. At this time, both cameras and
projectors were still very much hand cranked and most were geared
such that a constant cranking speed of two turns per second resulted in
this frame rate, which was very convenient. Those in the industry who
were beginning to consider themselves artists would have preferred a
higher rate, since this reduced the ﬂicker on the screen, hence the
phrase ‘going to the ﬂicks’. The ﬁlm producers and distributors, on the
other hand, were seriously opposed to an increase in frame rate, as this
would use more ﬁlm and therefore put up costs. Little has changed.
By 1926,the American Society of Motion Picture Engineers (SMPT,
later the SMPTE) Standards and Nomenclature Committee recom-
mended camera cranking speeds as follows:
Regarding camera speed we recommend as a recommended practice: a
camera cranking speed of 60 feet per minute (16fps), with a minimum
of 55 feet and a maximum of 65 feet when normal action is desired, in
connection with the Society of Motion Picture Engineers recommended
practice of 80 feet per minute projection speed (21fps).
To recommend different taking and projection speeds may now seem
ridiculous, but what they were trying to do was to set a standard for a
frame rate that was perceived to be correct on viewing.Try turning the
sound off on your television and notice how the action suddenly seems
to be slower, despite your certain knowledge that it cannot be. It
would be uncharitable to think that the theatre owners were keen to

reduce the length of the shows so as to pack more audiences in –
wouldn’t it?
The result of this is that from the turn of the century to the coming
of sound, the camera frame rate was set at roughly 16 frames per sec-
ond. When sound recorded optically on the same ﬁlm as the picture
came in around 1927, the frame rate of 16fps or 60 feet of ﬁlm per
minute was too slow to make an adequate sound recording using the
optical recording techniques available at the time. A faster speed was
needed to enable more frequencies to be recorded. By now, it was
known that the ﬂicker apparent in a ﬁlm projected at 16fps, or there-
abouts, started to disappear above a projection rate of 20fps.At 30fps
it appeared to disappear completely even on the most demanding
scenes – these usually being those with pronounced highlights, as
ﬂicker is more discernible in the brighter areas of a scene.
In America, the mains electricity has a frequency of 60 cycles per
second (cps); therefore, a standard synchronous electric motor there
will have a shaft speed of 1440 revolutions per minute. This gives a
shaft speed of 24 revolutions per second.The Americans, who after all
pioneered the making of the talkies, therefore chose the very conveni-
ent frame rate of 24fps as being almost totally free of any ﬂicker, pro-
ducing a linear ﬁlm speed sufﬁciently high to enable good sound to be
recorded next to the picture on the same piece of ﬁlm and being
absurdly simple to drive the projectors at a constant speed from a sim-
ple synchronous motor; 24fps is still today the world standard frame
rate for theatrical motion pictures.
For television, matters are slightly different.The television scan rate
is inexorably linked to the frequency of the local mains; therefore, in
America, where the local mains frequency is 60cps, the televisions will
display a complete picture 30 times per second. To overcome the dis-
crepancy between the theatrical cinema frame rate of 24fps and the
television rate of 30fps they, effectively, show every fourth frame
twice. For high-quality commercials for television in the USA, it is not
uncommon to increase the taking rate to 30fps.
In the UK and other parts of the world, where the mains frequency
is 50cps, this results in a completed frame rate of 25fps. It is normal to
shoot at 25fps if the ﬁlm is intended only for television release.
Feature ﬁlms are still shot at 24fps and, when shown on television, run
4 per cent faster than in the cinema and therefore the overall duration
is also reduced by 4 per cent.This makes little difference – remember
the SMPE 1926 recommendation of a taking to projection discrepancy
of 25 per cent. The only perceivable drawback is a very slight change
in the pitch of the sound, which would only be noticeable to someone
having perfect pitch. I have only ever known one person comment on
this effect and today pitch correction circuitry is available at a very
reasonable cost.
The intermittent mechanism
The heart of a ﬁlm camera, the mechanism that enables it to take a
series of still pictures, is known as the intermittent mechanism. To be
successful, a ﬁlm camera must divide the picture-taking cycle, usually
evenly, between a period where the ﬁlm is absolutely still and revealed
to the taking lens and a period when the light from the lens must be
The motion picture camera

blanked off to enable the ﬁlm to be pulled down to the next position
ready to expose the next frame. To do this, a number of devices are
employed:
1
A shutter to blank off the aperture while the mechanism pulls the
ﬁlm through ready for the next frame to be exposed.
2
A channel, or gate, in which to position the ﬁlm accurately.
3
A device to pull the ﬁlm down to its next position, usually a ‘claw’.
4
Loops of ﬁlm top and bottom of the ﬁlm gate to act as reservoirs
during the pull-down period.
The shutter
In a ﬁlm camera the shutter is usually a rotating disc placed immedi-
ately in front of the ﬁlm gate and having a segment removed to allow
light to pass to the aperture for exposure while, for the other part of
the cycle, the remaining part of the disc rotates to blank off the light
during the period in which the ﬁlm is moving to the next frame to be
taken at the same blanking rate as the camera frame rate. Figure 4.2
shows a classic 180° shutter between the taking lens and the aperture
in the ﬁlm gate.
Some cameras use a twin-bladed shutter, often known as a ‘butter-
ﬂy’ shutter, as illustrated in Figure 4.3.This is claimed to be better bal-
anced and therefore reduce vibration and, as it has two blades, the
shaft speed can be reduced to half that with a 180° shutter and this is
said to help reduce camera noise.
The ﬁlm gate
Behind the shutter will be the ﬁlm gate, which is made to a very high
accuracy in order to keep each frame in exactly the same position,

laterally, as its neighbours. The gate is usually several frames long and
will have a slot in it to allow the claw to enter the perforations in the ﬁlm
and another to allow a register pin if this is used in the camera’s design.
The claw
The most common mechanism for moving the ﬁlm from one frame 
to the next is known as a claw, simply because when they were
invented they looked like an animal’s claw, an arm with a hook or nail
on the end. Figure 4.4 shows an early Williamson mahogany-cased,
hand-cranked camera, which has recently shot some very good pic-
tures. Despite its age, it graphically shows the classic layout of an inter-
mittent mechanism.
Figure 4.5 shows the current Panavision lightweight camera mech-
anism, one of the best in the business. Despite being much more
sophisticated, it has remarkable similarities to the Williamson – two
sprockets top and bottom of the camera box and claw,now much more
sophisticated and precise, with the addition of a register pin. In order
to improve the vertical alignment, many cameras now provide a regis-
ter pin or pins that are inserted into perforations adjacent to the aper-
ture just as the claw is retracting and remain there for the duration of
the exposure. Figure 4.5 shows Panavision’s solution to this challenge.
The horizontal bar with the drilled holes right in the middle of the pic-
ture is the register pin operating leg; there is a drop bar just behind the
gate to locate the actual register pins in the two perforations at the
bottom of the frame. In this camera, the claw mechanism is operated
by a link mechanism, which can be seen just below the register pin
actuating bar.
In many camera mechanisms, one of the complications is that if the
gate is straight the claw must have some means of converting the rotary
motion of the drive shaft into an absolutely straight movement at the
claw tip, as in the Williamson layout. This can lead to inaccuracies,

vibration and noise. The Panavision mechanism echoes the earlier
Mitchell mechanism in curving the bottom of the gate so that the claw
is only required to follow this curved portion of the gate. This design
leads to a very vibration-free claw movement of superb accuracy,
which is incredibly quiet.
The claw mechanism has to be made to the highest possible toler-
ances, as the distance each frame is moved must be identical and must
be repeated, exactly, every time. When you realize that, during a 
10-minute roll of ﬁlm, the claw will have pulled 16000 frames of ﬁlm
through the camera, you get some impression of both the precision
and durability required of the claw mechanism.
The loop
Between the box holding the reserve and used ﬁlm, known as the ﬁlm
magazine, and the box containing the camera mechanism and the 
camera gate will be one or two sprocket wheels with teeth that engage

with the ﬁlm’s perforations and geared to the claw mechanism, thus
ensuring a constant supply of ﬁlm both to the gate and taking the ﬁlm
away after exposure. As the sprocket will be running continuously and
the claw only acts intermittently above and below the gate, the ﬁlm is
allowed to form loops.The loop above the gate forms a reservoir of ﬁlm
ready for the claw to pull it through the gate; this action then enlarges
the loop at the bottom of the gate ready for the sprocket to take it away.
The complete cycle of an intermittent movement is shown in Figure
4.6. In ﬁlm strip A, the frame being exposed is just coming to the end
of its full exposure.The shutter is starting to close, the claw is entering
the appropriate perforation and the register pin is withdrawing.In ﬁlm
strip B, the shutter is closed, the register pin is fully retracted and the
claw is commencing the pull-down. In ﬁlm strip C, the shutter is still
closed, the register pin still withdrawn and the claw is halfway through
the pull-down. In ﬁlm strip D, the shutter is still closed, the register pin
still withdrawn but the claw is nearing the end of its travel and starting
to slow down. In ﬁlm strip E, the ﬁlm has come to rest, the shutter is
starting to open, the claw is withdrawing and the register pin is nearly
fully in to its perforation. In ﬁlm strip F, the shutter is fully open, thus
starting the exposure, the register pin is fully locked into its perfora-
tion, thus holding the frame being exposed absolutely still, and the
claw is travelling upwards behind the gate to return to the top of its
travel. In ﬁlm strip G, the shutter is still open, the register pin is still in
and the claw has nearly reached its topmost position. In ﬁlm strip H,
the shutter has closed, the register pin has withdrawn and the claw has
entered the perforation relating to the next frame and is just starting
its pull-down. The cycle is now complete – the mechanism is back to
ﬁlm strip B and will now commence the whole cycle again.
The reﬂex viewﬁnder
Early ﬁlm cameras had viewﬁnders either by the side or above the tak-
ing lens. The viewﬁnder, therefore, didn’t see exactly the same frame
The motion picture camera
43
Figure 4.5 The Panavision

as the cameras lens.This is known as parallax error, as the optical axis
of the taking lens and that of the viewﬁnder will point in the same
direction but will run parallel to each other. This problem was ﬁrst
overcome when a German company, Arnold & Richter, introduced
their Arriﬂex 35 mirror reﬂex camera to the world at the 1937 Leipzig
Fair. This camera totally revolutionized the way ﬁlm cameras were
designed from then on.
The Arriﬂex did not have its shutter running ﬂat to, and in the same
plane as, the ﬁlm gate but had it angled at 45° to the gate and the aper-
ture. Furthermore, the front surface of the shutter had a mirrored sur-
face,so that when the shutter was closed the light that was blocked from
the aperture was now sent off at a right angle.This image was then dis-
played on a ground glass whose distance from the lens, via the mirrored
shutter,was exactly the same as the ﬁlm aperture.A second ﬁxed mirror,
or prism, then sent the image on the ground glass to the viewﬁnder
optics.Thus,the image in the viewﬁnder was identical to that on the ﬁlm,
as they shared the light from the lens on an alternating basis.
The original Arriﬂex was organized so that the mirrored shutter
sent the light horizontally to the viewﬁnder. Today, cameras divide
between those that send it horizontally and those that have the
shutter beneath the lens and send it upwards to the viewﬁnder.
Interestingly, Arriﬂex have made cameras with both conﬁgurations.
Figure 4.7 shows the arrangement of a reﬂex viewﬁnder where the
light is sent upwards.

Viewing screens
The ground glass viewing screens of the early reﬂex cameras have now
been replaced with a slice of an end-on bunch of ﬁbre-optics cut, and
ground ﬂat, to produce a focusing screen. This greatly reduces
vignetting at the edges of the image, is much more critical of exact
focus so that the camera operator can determine the focus more eas-
ily, forms an image far brighter than a ground glass and has less bright-
ness fall-off in the corners of the frame.
There is a very reliable way of setting your eyepiece to your natural
vision. Point the camera at an object less than six feet, or two metres,
away, and now rack the lens to inﬁnity – use a lens of at least the
‘normal’ focal length and focus the viewﬁnder ocular on the cross in
the middle of the viewﬁnder, if there isn’t a cross focus on the line
around the viewﬁnder mask. Now refocus on the scene and you will be
able to eye focus perfectly.
The ﬁlm magazine
In order to be able to change from one roll of ﬁlm to another at any
time, both the feed roll of ﬁlm and the take-up roll are housed in a
light-tight container provided with a light trap, through which the ﬁlm
can exit and re-enter the box – this assembly is known as the ﬁlm
magazine.
Two conﬁgurations of magazine are common today. The ﬁrst is the
displacement magazine, where both rolls are held in a single chamber,
as shown in Figure 4.8.The displacement magazine takes advantage of

the fact that while the take-up roll is getting larger, as ﬁlm is exposed,
the feed roll is decreasing in diameter. In Figure 4.8, the dotted lines
represent where a full feed roll and a full take-up roll would sit in the
magazine. Clearly, there is not enough room for both of them. By care-
fully siting the hubs that will hold the plastic cores the ﬁlm will come
on, the magazine can be laid out so that even if the feed and take-up
rolls do get close to each other they will never actually touch.
This has two advantages: ﬁrstly, the magazine will be smaller than a
design not taking advantage of the displacement effect; secondly, the
whole device will be lighter, this being particularly valuable when the
camera is to be hand-held or ﬁtted to a steadycam rig.
At the bottom of the magazine illustrated in Figure 4.8 can be seen
a light trap.This may consist of either a sprocket or large felt roller in
its centre, with four felt rollers, two on the ﬁlm side and two on the
daylight side of the complete trap. By arranging light bafﬂes within
and around this arrangement, the designer can ensure that no light
from the outside can enter the ﬁlm chamber even in the brightest
sunlight.
If a sprocket is used in the light trap then, when loading the ﬁlm in
the dark, the size of the ﬁlm loop on the outside of the magazine will
have to be carefully set. If the light trap uses only felt rollers, then
there is no need to establish an exact loop size when loading the
magazine. When this type of magazine is ﬁtted to the camera, having
laced the ﬁlm around the camera’s mechanism, either the take-up roll
will have to be tensioned by hand or, on some cameras, a lace button is
pressed and the magazine feed and take-up motors automatically
adjust the spare ﬁlm, exiting and entering the light trap to exactly the
right tension.
An alternative layout is the coaxial magazine. Here the feed and
take-up rolls sit side by side, and an arrangement of sprockets and
rollers deliver the ﬁlm to the camera gate in the necessary straight line
path.A representation of this can be seen in Figure 4.9.

Film camera layout
There are many individual layouts for a ﬁlm camera, but Figure 4.10
shows the basic principle of most of them. Once the ﬁlm magazine is
ﬁtted to the camera, the loop coming from the camera can be laced
through the camera mechanism. It usually has to pass over a sprocket
wheel, shown as the dotted circle, and is kept in place by lay-on rollers,
shown as the grey circles. Having left the sprocket, the ﬁlm forms the
ﬁlm feed loop; it then passes through the ﬁlm gate, with its associated
aperture and claw mechanism, and so on to the take-up loop, back
over the sprocket, and ﬁnally returns to the magazine light trap.
Some cameras employ a quite different layout, where the main
sprocket and the back pressure plate of the gate are contained in
every magazine. In this instance, the claw mechanism must be in front
of the gate. One conﬁguration of this layout is shown in Figure 4.11.
During ﬁtting the magazine, shown in the darker grey, slides horizon-
tally towards the camera body, shown in lighter grey. Clearly, the loop

size and its position relative to the gate must be carefully set before
the magazine is ﬁtted, and this makes for a slightly more difﬁcult load-
ing procedure in the dark. Many cameramen feel that the advantages
of almost instant camera reloads and smaller overall camera conﬁ-
guration more than make up for the slight complication in loading the
magazines.
Magazines for this type of layout are often of the displacement type,
though some have a conﬁguration of clip-on and coaxial layout, the
Arri 16 SR III being one such. The Aaton 35 III takes the concept of
displacement one stage further by actually moving the position of the
take-up hub during ﬁlming, so that the maximum distance between
the hubs can be reduced still further, thus making the magazine even
smaller and lighter in this very compact and elegant 35mm camera.

Artistic decisions
When you come to order a lens set for a picture, you are faced with a
number of interesting problems and choices.These relate to:
●
Deﬁnition or sharpness.
●
Speed or maximum aperture.
●
Contrast, or how quickly does black become white?
●
Do you need prime lenses, a zoom or both?
●
What focal lengths do you need? Should you include extreme wide
angle or telephoto?
Lenses have developed dramatically over the last 20 years. During this
time there have been two areas where lens designers have con-
centrated their efforts – speed and deﬁnition. In doing this, they have
developed some amazing lenses but we, as artists, do not always want
enormously high deﬁnition images nor always need a large maximum
aperture.
It is common, especially on feature ﬁlms these days, to shoot with
some kind of diffusion ﬁlter on the lens – so why do we assume that
the character of the picture will be what we desire when a high deﬁnition
lens has some of that deﬁnition destroyed by a ﬁlter? Could we not
choose a lens that has the natural characteristic we desire without
needing the ﬁlter – and would that be an advantage?
Characteristics of lenses
Today, we think of our lenses in very critical technical terms. However,
it is as interesting to think of their emotional character. What follows
must, of its nature, be broad generalizations and very much my per-
sonal opinion:
●
German lenses are crisp, analytical and fast. Clinical, even.
●
English prime lenses are traditionally warm, emotional, have dark
moody shadows and come with a relatively high deﬁnition.
●
The English Cooke zooms are very gracious in their shadow ren-
dition. I am biased, for if I am going to use a zoom then it is most
likely to be a Cooke.The Cooke 18–100mm T3 zoom for 35mm is,
49

in my view, one of the ﬁnest lenses ever produced – I shot over 
90 per cent of my last picture through one.With 16mm, the Canon
8–64mm zoom is also a ﬁne lens that I use a lot.
●
American lenses tend to have a high technical speciﬁcation, are
generally reasonably sharp and are physically wonderful to look at.
●
Japanese prime lenses have, until recently, mostly been derived
from lenses originally computed for still cameras.They have tended
to be a little too high in contrast for motion picture work, have
unfamiliar maximum apertures and do not come in matched sets.
This is changing – the Canon 8–64mm zoom mentioned earlier was
originally computed for video use but has adapted to motion pic-
tures superbly. Indeed, Canon lenses do seem to suit cinematogra-
phy better than most lenses derived from the stills and video world.
●
French lenses are, in the main, a mystery to the English, though
they are a little more favoured by American cinematographers.
The French ‘look’ is very attractive and has been going for some
time. The desire for a particular feel to the images has inﬂuenced
both French cameramen and their lens designers.They have been
working in sympathy with each other and to each other’s advantage.
The other nations’ lens designers have also been giving their customers
what they want.As a result of this,the knowledgeable cinematographer
has a tremendous selection of glassware.
The fundamentals
In order to achieve a higher deﬁnition when tested on a lens chart,
which usually contains ﬁner and ﬁner black and white lines, the lens
designer trades contrast against deﬁnition. If you want to resolve black
against white, you need a lens with high contrast and very little internal
ﬂare; this adds to the measurable deﬁnition under these conditions.
If, on the other hand, your main consideration is a long tone range,
you might trade off a little contrast and a lower measured deﬁnition 
in order to get a gentler, and perhaps more pleasing, gradation.
Given that the current fashion is for a slightly diffused, ‘natural’
image, then you might trade off a little speed, contrast and deﬁnition
for a lens that gave you what you wanted without the need for ﬁltration.
Perceived sharpness with regard to contrast
The eye/brain combination perceives sharpness quite differently from
the way we might measure resolution on a lens testing bench.Perception
is an impossible thing to measure yet we, as cinematographers, need to
get a grasp of how our audience will see our work and need to know if
they will consider our pictures to be sharp.
Increasing the contrast of a scene will, most likely, increase the per-
ceived sharpness of the scene.That said, it might also reduce the artis-
tic value of the scene or even take it away from the cinematographer’s
initial concept of the scene as represented in the script. A cinemato-
grapher might wish to show a scene with a reasonably high resolution
but having a gentle, low-key feel to it.To do this, the cinematographer
needs lenses that have a very long tone range and a gentle contrast,
but that still appear to be sharp.
50
Practical Cinematography

Let us look at some of the sharpness we perceive in a scene as
against the actual resolution of the image. In Figure 5.1, we have two
nearly identical images. Don’t study them too carefully, but at a glance
which do you think is the sharper? I would guess you chose the bottom
one.Wrong! All the images for this example were taken on my Nikon
CoolPix camera; the top picture was downloaded at 300 dots per inch
(DPI) and the lower picture at 75DPI. The difference is the top pic-
ture, at the higher resolution, has a much lower contrast than the bot-
tom picture – contrast has fooled you into thinking the resolution is
higher when the contrast is higher.
Lenses
51
Figure 5.1 The relationship
between resolution and contrast

Now look at Figure 5.2.Which do you think is sharper here? I guess
you will again choose the bottom picture. Both pictures were down-
loaded at 300DPI, so they both have the same resolution. Again, it is
the higher contrast of the bottom picture that makes it look sharper.
Don’t look at Figure 5.3 until you are holding the book at arm’s
length and then try and decide which picture is sharper. My guess is
you will think they both look the same. Now bring the book to your
normal reading distance, normally 10 inches or 25 centimetres. If you
look at the top of the gate, you should see a jagged line in the bottom
picture but a true and straight one in the top picture. Both pictures
have exactly the same contrast, but the top picture has a resolution of
52
Practical Cinematography
Figure 5.2 When contrast only
makes a difference

300DPI and the bottom a resolution of 75DPI, proving, I hope, that
viewing distance is also a critical factor.
The conclusion from all this is that a lens that appears sharp may
not be so; it is therefore important that you measure resolution and
judge contrast – separately.
Maximum aperture
Let us suppose that you are about to light a picture, during which you
do not envisage any scene needing an aperture wider than T3.2. You
see the mood of the piece requiring good deﬁnition and high contrast
Lenses
53
Figure 5.3 How viewing distance
affects the judgement of resolution

on some scenes, though perhaps not on others. You have decided this
because you want to vary the deﬁnition between scenes as part of your
overall strategy for the visual pacing of the ﬁlm. You will achieve the
variation by the use of ﬁlters of different strengths.
You might, say, look to Zeiss Super Speeds as your prime lens set.
They are truly magniﬁcent lenses. But, if you are never going to open
them up beyond T3.2, is this wise? Remember you want maximum
deﬁnition in some scenes in order to contrast this with others.
Let us compare a T1.3 lens and a T2 lens both working at an aper-
ture of T3.2. For simplicity, Figure 5.4 shows a single component lens,
but imagine what happens in a compound retrofocal lens containing
many elements – things are much worse.
As you can see, when both lenses are working at an aperture of T3.2
the light has to go through far more glass in the T1.3 lens than in the T2
lens. Now it should be obvious that the more glass the light has to go
through,at any given aperture,the more aberrations are likely to occur.
So, why expect a T1.3 lens to give a ﬁner picture at T3.2 than a lens
with a maximum aperture of T2? There are strong arguments to say
that it won’t.
A further disadvantage is that many lenses with maximum aper-
tures of around T1.3 have minimum apertures of only T11, and at T11
they often perform far from their best – imagine how much glass there
must be right in the centre of such a lens.A lens with a maximum aper-
ture of T2, on the other hand, will usually stop down to T16 or even
T22 – quite an advantage with today’s high-speed ﬁlms.
Telephoto lenses
With telephoto lenses all the above remains true, but you have to take
depth of ﬁeld into account in choosing which lens to use.There is little
point in trying to do a tricky focus pull on, say, a 300mm lens at T2.8 if
there is any way you can light up to T4 or better. If the shot is going to
be a nightmare at T2.8, you might be better to swap to a higher speed
ﬁlm just for that one shot – the extra grain hardly ever shows when it
is cut together. So, if you are going to try and avoid shooting at T2.8
with your 300mm, why order such a fast lens? A 300mm T4 lens might
very well perform better at T4 than the T2.8 lens stopped down to T4
or it might not, you would need to run a test.
A telephoto lens is not the same as a prime long-focus lens.Telephoto
means the lens has been optically telescoped and is therefore physically

shorter than its stated focal length.This can make the lens very handy,
but does put more glass between the subject and the ﬁlm plane.A true
long-focus lens usually has few elements and is thus optically very
pure but has, by its very nature, to be physically at least as long as its
prescribed focal length.
As an example, I own a 500mm prime long-focal-length lens of max-
imum aperture T5.7, which gives most beautiful pictures, is not too
heavy but, with its lens hood, is around 750mm long. Compare this
with a Canon 300/600mm telephoto lens, which in its 600mm conﬁg-
uration has a maximum aperture of T4 and is less than 400mm long.
The ‘look’ on ﬁlm of the two lenses could not be more different – for
drama or feature work I choose my prime 500mm every time, but a
wildlife cinematographer would almost certainly make the opposite
choice.
Wide-angle lenses
Wide-angle lenses have a different problem. Imagine looking down
the empty lens port of a 35mm camera and think of a point 18mm 
in front of the ﬁlm plane. You will see that this space is occupied by 
the mirror shutter when it is in the closed position. How then do we
regularly use a lens of 18mm focal length, let alone shorter? It is
achieved by using a retrofocal design. Retrofocal means that the lens
contains elements in addition to those forming the 18mm prime lens,
whose sole job is to refocus the rays further away from the back 
element so that the lens will produce a sharp image at the ﬁlm plane
despite being perhaps, physically, 50mm or so away.This is one reason
why the wide-angle lenses are often the most expensive of a set, as
they contain a lot of very sophisticated glass. One of the problems in
designing wide lenses is that they are very prone to distortion, usually
barrelling.
Zooms
Zoom lenses,by their very design,have far more elements within them
than prime lenses and therefore come with all the same problems, plus
a few more. Figure 5.5 shows the internal construction of a Cooke
18–100mm zoom.
Many zooms change the image size when the focus is changed.They
may vignette at certain focal lengths, and I have even known one have
a colour shift at one end on the zoom range. The problems are min-
imized by the designers keeping to sensible maximum apertures and
not trying to offer too long a zoom range.
Most high-quality 35mm zooms are around T3 and 16mm zooms
around T2.5. While the 16mm Zeiss T2 10–100mm, when ﬁrst intro-
duced, seemed like a miracle, in fact it was, in my opinion, not as good
as its predecessor the T3 10–100mm in some respects, especially with
regard to image shift, vignetting and, at around 16mm, deﬁnition.
Most of these problems were ironed out with the introduction of the
Mark 2, but this necessitated the use of a much larger front element
cluster, and subsequently having to use a different, larger and more
expensive matte box.
Lenses
55

The Cooke 9–50mm, 10.4–52mm for Super 16, and the Canon
8–64mm limit their maximum aperture to T2.5 or T2.8 for the Cooke
and T2.4 for the Canon. These sensible apertures and shorter zoom
ranges have enabled the designers to produce lenses with virtually no
image shift, very high deﬁnition and no discernible distortions or
vignetting. The same applies to the 35mm Cooke 18–100 T3 lens of
which, as you will have gathered, I am a huge fan.
I realize many cinematographers might disagree, but it really is
almost impossible to tell, subjectively, the difference between images
shot on any of these zooms and most prime lenses. You might be able
to tell when testing but, I submit, it is virtually impossible once the
shots have been cut into a narrative scene. Zoom lens design has come
a long way since they were ﬁrst introduced. If you are going to use any
kind of ﬁltration then, by balancing its strength, any difference really
is impossible to see.
Interestingly, Canon also make an 11.5–138mm T2.5 zoom for
Super 16mm, which is also a ﬁne lens with just one drawback – there
is a noticeable image size change on focusing.
Conclusions
You must be very careful and aware when you choose your lens set.
Lenses that, on paper, seem to have a high speciﬁcation may not per-
form as well as some others given the way you are going to use them.
The character of the lens, under the circumstances you are going to
use it, often means more to the cinematographer than the technical
speciﬁcations of the lens, such as the minimum aperture, which may
never be used.
Most importantly, remember that your audience has come to be
entertained and will probably never know what lens you used, nor will
they care – all they are interested in is that you stir their emotions.

Modern lens designs
Panavision Primo
A few years ago, Panavision introduced a new range of prime lenses
called Primos. These were a very successful attempt to offer the cine-
matographer a new set of lenses that would have,as near as was attain-
able, totally matching characteristics across the whole range of focal
lengths – at this they very much succeeded.
Since the ﬁrst edition of this book, I have had considerably more
experience with Panavision lenses and have had to reconsider my
views on them, very much upwards. They appear to have what I can
only describe as a clarity, not a very technical term but the one that
seems most appropriate. The images they produce are remarkably
true to the way my eye sees the set before me and they are superbly
sharp, which extends the possibilities of the use of ﬁltration. Their
accurate colour correction and consistency from lens to lens makes a
DP’s life very satisfying when shooting with Primos. Though it’s not
strictly applicable to the ﬁlm world, I feel I would like to comment on
a couple of Panavision Digital Primos. In the last two years I have had
the luck to shoot quite a few projects using the Panavision High
Deﬁnition cameras and have frequently used the matched pair of 4.5:1
zooms.The wider zoom has a range of 6–27mm at T1.8 and the longer
one a range of 25–112mm at T1.9.The pictures I have shot using these
two lenses on both Panavision’s 900 and 750 series cameras have
impressed me beyond measure – they are probably the ﬁnest lenses
I have ever had the pleasure to use.
It would be fascinating to try these Digital Primos reconﬁgured for
Super 16.
Once Panavision had embarked on designing the Primos,all the lenses
were calculated to match very closely on many parameters. These
included colour rendition, maximum aperture (T1.9), outer barrel
conﬁguration and, a great feature of this range of lenses, the optimum
deﬁnition that is maintained at the maximum aperture.
All the Panavision Primo lenses have the exceptional ‘user friendli-
ness’ well known and much loved of all Panavision equipment.This, in
particular, makes them very popular with all members of the ﬁlm crew.
Zeiss
Zeiss were one of the earliest lens manufacturers to gain worldwide
recognition long before man was able to capture a moving image.They
continue to keep a very ﬁne reputation today, having been one of the
ﬁrst manufacturers to produce very high speed lenses, with all the
other parameters still of the highest quality.
The Zeiss Distagons, when ﬁrst introduced, virtually revolutionized
shooting 16mm ﬁlm overnight. I remember ﬁlming in a French restaur-
ant at night with no additional lighting whatsoever.A man passing our
unit table mumbled ‘It will never come out’ with a Gallic shrug and
moved on. I wrote on the back of my business card, ‘Zeiss Distagon
T1.3’ and asked a waiter to take it over to his table. Moments later 
he was by my side holding one of my early Distagons with what can
only be described as reverence. Such was the impact of this new and
wonderful lens set.

The company’s zoom lenses for 16mm photography are of high
quality and have now gone through several generations. I have a par-
ticular affection for the original 10–100mm T3 or T3.1 lens. If you can
ﬁnd one in good condition it is still a very usable lens much,and wisely,
favoured by many ﬁlm schools.
Zeiss now produce high-speed lenses for both 16mm and 35mm
photography, and they are all of the highest quality with some very
interesting variants, including lenses that can be used for normal photo-
graphy but will focus extraordinarily close.
Cooke lenses (S4 range)
Soon after the introduction of Panavision’s Primo lenses, which, of
course,you could only hire if you were getting your camera equipment
from Panavision, a number of independent camera rental houses real-
ized that they were slightly wrong-footed as they had nothing to offer
which might compete with the Primos. The Zeiss super speeds were
good but, by comparison, an older generation of computation. So they
got together and started asking around as to who might produce
something to give them an interesting range to market.
Cooke Lenses had already embarked on the early work of a new
range of prime lenses.Here was a wonderful opportunity.Cooke Lenses
had, for a couple of generations, been revered for very ﬁne lenses with a
certain ‘look’. This look is hard to describe and impossible to deﬁne in
any technical or scientiﬁc way. It is an emotional thing: words like
romantic, gentle, deep shadows, kind to the artists all come to mind.
Nevertheless, Cooke lenses have always had very good deﬁnition.
Cooke have,over the years prior to the introduction of the S4 range,
produced three important series of prime lenses. The Series 1 range
were innovative in their time but now hopelessly out of date. Their
Series 2 are famed worldwide. Perceived wisdom, which I agree with,
says that a set of Series 2 lenses, with the 18mm replaced by a Series 3
lens that is superior to the Series 2, may well have been the ultimate
set of prime lenses of that era. I have shot two pictures with exactly
this set (admittedly they had all been recoated and set in new housings
by Century Precision Optics) and received much praise for the results.
As a cinematographer, what else does one choose a set of lenses for?
Both pictures were, of course, period pieces, where the lenses helped
me create the feeling of the times.
Having now tried the Cooke S4 range, I am very impressed. Some-
how they have produced an utterly modern set of lenses but have
retained the ‘Cooke look’.
Cooke have also brought the range very much up to date as regards
the mechanical engineering. Having taken note of a modern focus
puller’s needs, they have completely dispensed with the conventional
scroll or screw-thread method of racking the lens in and out to focus it
and,borrowing design thoughts from their zoom lenses,used cams and
cam followers to give a much more linear feel to the focusing scale,
together with greater smoothness.This has enabled them to engrave a
very user-friendly focus scale, giving focus pullers much greater con-
trol over their craft.
For many cinematographers a huge advantage of the Cooke S4
primes is that they match to extraordinary close tolerances the colour
58

rendition and feel of the Cooke zooms. They are also all optimized to
work at their common maximum aperture of T2.
Choice
So which range of lenses should you choose? It doesn’t really matter –
Ziess,Primos and Cooke S4s are all absolutely superb.What is important
is that you read the script ﬁrst, decide on the look you want and then
choose the lens set that suits you best. Today’s cinematographers are
extraordinarily lucky to have a choice of at least three great sets of lenses.
Lens distortion and aberrations
The three most common forms of optical distortion that occur in lenses
are known as pincushion distortion,barrelling and chromatic aberration.
Prime lenses very rarely show any discernible distortion.The excep-
tion might be extreme wide-angle lenses, some of which show a slight
tendency to barrel.
The ﬁnest zoom lenses will show no discernible distortion even at
the widest end of their range. Unfortunately, many current zoom lenses,
mainly those intended for or derived from those originally intended
for video cameras, still demonstrate considerable distortion. Again,
the most common or exaggerated distortion is barrelling at the wider
end of the zoom’s focal range. Because the market for video zooms
asks for very high zoom ratios coupled with wide maximum apertures,
the manufacturers cannot meet all the parameters of a perfect lens at
prices the market will bear.
The manufacturers do their best but, as in all things, you get what
you pay for and if you are asking for two of the lenses’ attributes to 
be long zoom range and wide aperture, then almost certainly other
parameters of the design will suffer. In this case, the choice usually
tends towards a design where a noticeable amount of barrelling occurs
at the wide end and very noticeable image size change shows strongly
when the focus is changed.
In many applications barrelling and image shifts are not important
drawbacks, since the kind of images the lenses will be used to record
mask the faults. For news and sport, where the camera is rarely
absolutely still, any image shift when focusing will not be noticeable.
Slight barrelling will only show where there are vertical lines in the
scene near the edge of the frame and, again, this does not occur often
in these applications.
The effect of distortion
Figure 5.6 shows a series of shapes in their perfect form. There is 
a square containing a circle that itself contains another square. Were
we to photograph this shape using a lens that suffered from pincush-
ion distortion, then the resultant image would look very much like
Figure 5.7, not at all acceptable.
If the same Figure 5.6 was photographed using a lens suffering from
barrelling,then the image created would appear as shown in Figure 5.8,
again unacceptable.
Lenses
59
Figure 5.6 Test shapes for lens
distortion
Figure 5.7 Pincushion distortion
Figure 5.8 Barrel distortion

If either of these distortions are present in the lens in use,the degree
of distortion can be measured, but more important is the perceived
degree of distortion. You have to look through the viewﬁnder and
decide if you can tolerate the effect you see.
The perceived level of distortion is usually a little less than one might
expect,as we are nearly always recording at the ﬁlm plane a rectangular
image taken from the centre of the circular image formed by the lens.
Figure 5.9 shows exactly the same drawing as Figure 5.8, but cut down
to a 16  9 image format.
Although the distortion still looks unacceptable, it now only
appears at its worst at the sides of the frame; the overall effect is less
to the eye than in Figure 5.8. If you suspect a lens of barrelling then
frame a vertical line, say the side of a building, at the edge of the frame
and make your own judgement.
Chromatic aberration
Chromatic aberration is the most commonly found aberration in older
lenses. It is rarely found in modern lenses, though one occasionally
ﬁnds it in lenses of long focal length. It is worth understanding, as it
displays very clearly one of the major problems lens designers have to
overcome; indeed, the correction of chromatic aberration was the ﬁrst
major optical breakthrough in the early days of photography.
Chromatic aberration occurs because light with different wave-
lengths, or colours, will be diffracted, or bent, by a different amount
after having passed through the air/glass, glass/air path as the light
travels through a lens.
Figure 5.10 shows, in an exaggerated form, the effect of light passing
through a simple lens. The most deviated wavelengths are ultraviolet,
shown as UV in the diagram. The least deviated, and therefore those
coming to a point of focus furthest from the lens, are the infrared rays,
shown as IR in the diagram. In between, at focus points progressively
further away from the lens, are blue, green and red.
This effect of focusing the rays of differing colours at different dis-
tances from the lens occurs in all simple, single lenses. It has long been
a well-known phenomenon: Sir Isaac Newton believed that it was such
an intractable problem that he concentrated on reﬂecting or mirror
optics for his telescopes, where the problem does not occur as the light
rays never pass through anything but air, thus obviating the problem.

As glasses of many more densities became available and the value
of constructing more complicated lens groups was understood, it
became increasingly possible to arrange for more and more wave-
lengths of light to focus at the same point after passing through the
whole of the lens. This was achieved by combining both positive and
negative lenses in groups, so that the failings of the individual elements
combined to cancel each other out, thus leaving the complete lens
aberration-free.
The ﬁrst lenses that successfully corrected for the three colours of
the visible spectrum to converge at the same point of focus were
known as triplets, as they were constructed from three single elements
having differing curvatures and made from glasses of different dens-
ities. Figure 5.11 shows one of the early, successful triplets, from the
ﬁrm of Cooke, Taylor, Taylor & Hobson, the company now known as
Cooke Lenses.
Further developments brought the Zeiss Tessar, as shown in Figure
5.12, where the rear lens of a basic triplet design has two simple lenses
cemented together for the rear element, thus enabling the optical
designer greater freedom of design.
Lenses have come a long way since the discovery of the basic triplet.
For example, the current Cooke S4 25mm lens – the lens elements
here are in double ﬁgures and the mechanics of focusing are now
much more sophisticated than a simple screw thread. Lenses such as
this have eliminated all apparent distortions and aberrations, come in
perfectly matched sets and can be utterly relied upon.

What is ﬁlm?
Rolls of ﬁlm are always known as ﬁlm stock.You will hear unexposed
ﬁlm referred to as raw stock. Once it is exposed, but not yet processed,
it becomes known as the rushes. Once exposed and processed, it is the
master negative. Confusingly, the print or tape sent back to production
by the laboratory the morning after processing is also known as the
rushes.In America,these rushes are known as the dailies,which removes
the confusion.
Today’s colour ﬁlm stocks are fairly complicated affairs, consisting 
of a support medium, known as the base, which is coated on one side
with as many as nine layers of light-sensitive emulsions. In addition,
there are several other layers such as the yellow ﬁlter layer.All of these
layers are collectively known as the emulsion. The top layer of the
emulsion is known as the supercoat, whose purpose is both to protect
the ﬁlm from mechanical damage and to lubricate it through the cam-
era gate. On the reverse side of the base, there is a removable coating
called the rem-jet backing. This is black and eliminates halation –
haloes around bright points of light. It is anti-static and also lubricated.
The history of the negative/positive photographic
process
The knowledge of photosensitive salts was noted by Albertus Magnus
as long ago as the thirteenth century. The basis of obtaining an image
using these salts was much worked upon but not made practical in the
sense we know photography today until the mid-nineteenth century.
In 1819, Sir John Herschel, the British scientist, discovered sodium
hyposulphate and its ability to dissolve silver chloride. It was not until
1839, 20 years later, that he told his friend William Henry Fox Talbot
of the discovery. By this time, Fox Talbot had developed a method of
obtaining an image on photosensitive paper using a silver halide as the
reactive chemical.The image was a negative one, but he had not found
a method of making it permanent, or ﬁxing it. Sodium hyposulphate
62

Film stock
63
dissolved out the still sensitive silver halide crystals, leaving stable
metallic silver as the image.
It was not until 31 January 1839 that Fox Talbot was able to present
a paper to the Royal Society in London showing he could make ‘photo-
genic drawings’ or shadows of real objects. By the end of September
1840, Fox Talbot had discovered the theory of the latent image and
found a method of developing it and stabilizing it, or ﬁxing it, to an
acceptable degree of permanence using Herschel’s sodium hyposul-
phate. This technique he called the Calotype and this was the origin-
ator of today’s negative/positive photographic process. At this stage,
though, both the negative and the positive had to be made on paper
soaked in the light-sensitive solution.
In the British Journal of Photography of 18 September 1871, an
English doctor, Richard L. Maddox, announced his method of spread-
ing a warm solution of gelatine onto glass plates, the gelatine being
mixed with cadmium bromide and silver nitrate. Thus, a further step
towards modern photography was taken, for now a light-sensitive
emulsion could be coated on an independent support material.
By around 1883, further developments in emulsion chemistry had
given the world an efﬁcient dry photographic plate, made of glass,
which could be prepared long in advance of the need to use it, could
be kept for a considerable time after exposure and before develop-
ment, and required less than a second’s exposure in daylight.
By 1889, George Eastman was using a thin ﬁlm of the plastic cellu-
loid as a base material for the ﬁlm for his latest amateur still camera
and it was the introduction of this support medium, or base, that pro-
duced the last factor needed for a ﬁlm that could be used practically by
the inventors of motion picture equipment.
The early ﬁlm bases were made of nitrocellulose. This produced a
very transparent and ﬂexible support. Unfortunately, the material is
also highly inﬂammable and somewhat dimensionally unstable. By
1920, a ‘safety’ base using cellulose acetate became available that is
more stable, slow to ignite and burned at the same rate as paper. It is
the instability of the nitrate base that is the main reason for the poor
survival of early ﬁlms. However, nitrate base continued to be used up
to the 1950s, when it was phased out.
From this potted history it is reasonable to say that four crucial elem-
ents had to be present before a ﬁlm stock capable of supporting a
moving image was available.They were:
1
The discovery of the latent image and how to develop it.
2
The application of a ﬁxer to that developed image to give it 
permanence.
3
The knowledge of how to incorporate the sensitive chemical in a
supporting medium, gelatine, so that it could easily be coated on
an independent base.
4
The introduction of a ﬂexible support for the image, celluloid, so
that the ﬁlm could run through an intermittent mechanism.
The basic photographic process
In order to consider the basic photographic process, let us look at a
simple black and white ﬁlm whose physical construction will be much
as shown in Figure 6.1.

64
Practical Cinematography
The emulsion is the light-sensitive layer of the ﬁlm. It is made up of
small crystals of sensitive material evenly distributed in a support
medium.The light-sensitive medium is silver halide, derived from pure
silver, and the support medium is gelatine, which is made from animal
skins and bones.
The gelatine support medium has a number of very useful proper-
ties. It is more or less transparent and therefore will let light through
to all the sensitive crystals at whatever depth they are embedded in its
thickness.It is easily permeated by water,so the various chemicals that
are needed to act upon the crystals during processing can reach their
target. It is also reasonably easy to produce in a very pure form.
We have seen how various researchers contributed to the discovery
of the negative/positive photographic process, but now we must
understand something of how it works. I am sure you will have heard
of a photographic emulsion as being made up of grains and, indeed,
we often refer to the visual texture of a photographic image as being
either grainy or, perhaps, having ﬁne grain.The chemical construction
of a photographic emulsion starts with a single atom of silver halide;
these atoms are then grouped together in varying numbers, some
forming small clusters made up of few atoms and some forming large
clusters containing many atoms. A typical emulsion will have many
sizes of clusters, from really quite large to very small. All of these 
clusters, whatever their size, are known as the grains in the ﬁlm.
If part of the photographic image is made up of many small grains,
then it might be referred to as being ﬁne grain.This means that there are
so many small grains packed so close together that in the ﬁnal image the
human eye will ﬁnd it very hard to discern one grain from another and
the picture, over that area, will look as if it has a continuous smooth
tone. If another part of the image is made up of a few large grains, each
probably spaced some distance apart, then the eye might be just able to
discern the pattern of the grains,and then it will not look very like a con-
tinuous tone and we would therefore describe it as grainy.
But how does all this come about? If you look at Figure 6.2 you will
see a representation of the layout of different sized grains embedded
in the emulsion before any exposure has taken place.To make the fol-
lowing explanation easier, there are only four different sizes of grain
shown in the illustration; in reality, there would be a huge number of
Adhesive

different sizes of grains. For the propose of understanding more
clearly, let us consider one grain of each of the four sizes in our exam-
ple being hit by an even area of light. Light is made up of particles of
energy we refer to as photons, so if you look at Figure 6.3 you will see
our four different sized grains being attacked by an even array of pho-
tons, each represented by an arrow. Because the photons are evenly
spaced and the grains are of differing sizes, the number of photons to
hit each grain will differ.
What will happen next is a chemical reaction. We have seen that
below the grain size there is a molecular structure. Let us suppose, for
Figure 6.2 The grain ﬁeld

the sake of argument, that every photon strikes an atom of the silver
halide. If this is the case, then every photon will cause an atom of 
silver halide to convert to an atom of metallic silver, as in Figure 6.4.
This is the ﬁrst part of the photographic process. The emulsion will
now consist of a number of silver halide atoms and a number of metallic
silver atoms. Clearly, we could not see this image as our eyes would
need light for that to happen and that would immediately expose
every atom in the emulsion. This is, in effect, an image waiting to be
made visible and we therefore refer to it as a latent image, the Concise
Oxford English Dictionary describing latent as ‘Hidden, concealed;
existing but not developed or manifest’ – exactly the situation our
metallic silver image ﬁnds itself in.
In order to make the image usable,again in total darkness,we immerse
the ﬁlm in a liquid known as the developer.What happens next is only
slightly short of miraculous. The developer is very selective, for if it is
applied for the right amount of time, in the correct strength and at the
right temperature, it will search out grains containing four or more
atoms of metallic silver within them and turn all the atoms to metallic
silver, not just those atoms of metallic silver but every atom of silver
halide within that grain as well. Grains, however big or small, that have
three or less grains of metallic silver will be totally unaffected,not even
those atoms that have been turned to metallic silver will become black.
The effect of this is shown in Figure 6.5.There is a danger here, because
if silver halide is left exposed to light for a very long time it will even-
tually turn black without the application of a developer; the developer
simply speeds up the process in a carefully controlled manner.
Therefore, if we now brought our ﬁlm out into the light in order to
view the image we might see it for a ﬂeeting moment, after which the
whole ﬁlm would turn black before our eyes.

67
Still in total darkness, and after exactly the right amount of devel-
opment time, we plunge our ﬁlm into an acid stop bath. As its name
suggests, this immediately stops the process of development but still
leaves the image vulnerable to more light. After the acid stop bath,
there remain active silver halide grains in the ﬁlm so, still in complete
darkness, the ﬁlm must now go into a ﬁx bath, which turns the remain-
ing silver halide into substance (complex sodium argentothiosul-
phates) that can then be washed out of the emulsion without affecting
the metallic silver.This chemical, the ﬁxer, is the sodium hyposulphate
discovered by Sir John Herschel in 1839, referred to earlier in this
chapter. You will occasionally hear the ﬁxer referred to as ‘hypo’, a
name derived from the chemical name of its primary component. So,
if the ﬁxer dissolves out of the photographic emulsion all the undevel-
oped grains but leaves all the developed grains completely unaffected,
then our little microcosm of the ﬁlm will look like Figure 6.6 and will,
at last, be safe to bring into the light. The application of all the above
liquid chemicals to the emulsion is referred to as processing that emul-
sion. If you compare Figures 6.2 and 6.7 you will see the effect of pro-
cessing on the whole grain ﬁeld.
Now the number of photons in the above example might be con-
sidered a medium exposure. Were we to consider a higher exposure,
which would be like that found in a much brighter part of the overall
scene, then the same four grains we used in the above example would
be attacked by a photon array much like that shown in the left of
Figure 6.8, but after processing all but one of the grains will be black,
as only the smallest grain failed to have four atoms of silver halide

part of the scene is recorded, and as there are far fewer photons only

turned from silver halide into metallic silver, resulting, after process-
ing, in only a single grain turning to black.
If the ﬁlm is to remain in perfect condition for many years it must
now be washed for a considerable time, as all the unwanted chemicals
must be completely removed and the gelatine emulsion left with only
metallic silver to form the image.
Therefore, the image formed by this process will have dark areas
where much light fell upon the ﬁlm and light areas where little light
arrived and, fortunately for our purpose, all the shades of grey in
between. It will therefore be the reverse brightness of the original
scene, and this we call a negative image.
In order to obtain an image that represents the original scene, the
negative must be printed on to another piece of ﬁlm,just as Fox Talbot’s
process announced in 1839. This new ﬁlm will produce an image with
the reverse densities of the negative and will return to the values corres-
ponding to the original scene. This new ﬁlm is called the positive and
must be processed in exactly the same way as the camera negative.

Colour negative ﬁlm
There is no such thing as a single colour photographic emulsion.At its
simplest, a modern colour negative ﬁlm is made up from three black
and white emulsions so arranged that each single layer records the
image of one of the primary colours that make up white light, i.e. red,
green and blue.
If you refer to Figure 6.10, you will see how the layers of coatings on
the ﬁlm base are arranged in order to record a colour image in what is
known as an integral tripack colour emulsion. Under the supercoat is
the ﬁrst emulsion. It is relatively easy to make a black and white emul-
sion that is only sensitive to blue light, so this is used as the uppermost
emulsion layer. Underneath this coating is an optical ﬁlter layer
coloured yellow. A yellow ﬁlter will let green and red light through,
but not blue. Again, it is possible to make a black and white emulsion
that is only sensitive to green and blue light, but all the blue light has
now been ﬁltered out, so this layer will only be struck by the green and
red light passed by the yellow ﬁlter. It will, therefore, only record the
green part of the image.The bottom emulsion layer is sensitive to red
and blue, but not to green, so this layer can only respond to red as blue
has been ﬁltered out.

If an exposed ﬁlm of this type is simply immersed in the standard
black and white developer/ﬁxer process, all you will get is three black
and white images. Therefore, a clever bit of chemistry is incorporated
in each of the three emulsions. The chemicals used are known as
colour couplers. Each individual layer has embedded in it a different
colour coupler whose job is, at a molecular level, to form a dye of 
the colour complementary to the colour of the light that exposed the
layer. What is more, this dye is formed only where silver is formed by
the developer.
As this is a negative ﬁlm intended for printing, each layer of emul-
sion must end up dyed the complementary colour to the original
scene.Therefore:
●
The blue-sensitive layer forms yellow dye.
●
The green-sensitive layer forms magenta dye.
●
The red-sensitive layer forms cyan dye.
Early colour ﬁlm was capable of recording roughly seven stops of
tonal range or a brightness range of 128:1. Modern ﬁlm stocks have
now been introduced with a tonal range of around 10 stops or a bright-
ness range of over 1000:1.
This has been made possible by the development of super-thin emul-
sion layers and the concept of coating two or three emulsions to make
up each colour layer. Figure 6.11 shows the basic layout of such a ﬁlm.
The trick is to coat layers of emulsion with different sensitivities, e.g. a
highly sensitive emulsion, a medium sensitivity emulsion and a slow
emulsion, together as a triple layer for each colour. By carefully over-
lapping the tonal range of each individual emulsion, the ﬁlm can

record a tonal range far greater than that of a ﬁlm having just a single
emulsion and with a considerable improvement in image quality.
Grain and graininess
Grain is the texture we see in a print that appears as a texture not asso-
ciated with the original scene. It becomes apparent when, for various
reasons, we can begin to perceive the distribution of the developed
metallic silver particles and we can perceive them long before we can
actually see any particles. Furthermore, because the print stock is of
exceptionally ﬁne grain, and consequently has a very slow speed, the
perceived grain comes from the structure of the negative emulsion,
not the positive emulsion.
It is thought that a larger crystal of silver halide is more sensitive to
light mainly because its surface area is greater and therefore has a bet-
ter chance of catching a light ray and being exposed. It follows that a
ﬁlm emulsion with a preponderance of large grains will therefore be
more sensitive. A fast, highly sensitive ﬁlm emulsion will normally
appear grainy. Conversely, a ﬁne-grained ﬁlm emulsion has a high res-
olution and poor sensitivity. At this point it must be said that recent
developments in emulsion technology have made the perceivable dif-
ferences between ﬁlm stocks of differing speeds much less noticeable
than they were even a few years ago.
It is worth considering at this point the difference between resolution
and perceived sharpness as it relates to the ﬁlm emulsion. Resolution
is deﬁned as the ability of the emulsion to record very narrow bands of
black and white lines and is measured, therefore, as the maximum
number of lines per millimetre that can be recorded on the emulsion’s
surface. Acutance, or what actually looks sharp to the eye, is the abil-
ity to record the edge sharpness of an image. Difference in grain size
and the contrast of the image will change the relationship of the appar-
ent deﬁnition and acutance of a given ﬁlm stock, and must always be
carefully balanced by the emulsion designer. Resolution, acutance and
apparent sharpness do not, therefore, always go hand in hand.

When does grain become unacceptable?
Grain will show up ﬁrst in two areas of the ﬁnal image and in both
cases it derives from the metallic silver image created on the negative.
Firstly,it will appear in the continuous mid-tones.Think of a continu-
ous blue summer sky photographed using a polarizing ﬁlter. Here we
have a continuous, unrelieved density on the print very closely approx-
imating a tone close to the middle of the tonal range the ﬁlm can
record. If there is the slightest grain or microscopic variation in density,
then our audience, whether they be photographically educated or not,
will immediately know that this effect is totally unreal, i.e. it doesn’t
happen in nature. For this reason their eye will immediately be drawn
to this unnatural phenomenon. Secondly, grain becomes very notice-
able if it is too apparent in the shadowed part of the ﬁnal image. This
is a photographic problem since, on the negative, where dark areas are
represented by pale areas, there are few exposed silver particles. This
continuous tone is one with only a few exposed grains scattered about.
Again, we have a situation where the audience’s awareness demands
that black is black and not something approximating it with a few bits
of information, the silver crystals,‘boiling’ in the darkness.
The solution to the mid-tone problem is to choose a ﬁlm stock 
with a ﬁne enough grain for the problem never to be apparent to the
audience. The solution to the second problem, grain noticeable in the
shadows, is to give the shadows just a little exposure above the bottom
threshold of the ﬁlm’s recording ability, so that there are just enough
grains in that area of the negative to deceive the audience’s eye into
failing to see the image of the silver crystals. To discover how to do
this, refer to Chapter 12.
Perforations
Film stock is manufactured in what are known as parent rolls, usually
6000 feet long and around a metre and a half wide. The parent roll
therefore needs to be cut, or slit, into the required width of 16, 35, 65
or 70mm. It is usual to slit the whole parent roll into just one ﬁlm
width. Having slit the parent roll into the required width, the ﬁlm must
then be perforated. Back at the start of the twentieth century, when
the motion picture industry was just emerging, one of the main areas
of competition between the companies seeking to dominate the mar-
ket with their format was the type of perforation used. Edison used a
rectangular perforation, the French a round one and most other
American companies something approaching a square perforation.
Around 1916, the Society of Motion Picture Engineers of America
sought to standardize the perforation used throughout America: they
chose to adopt the perforation that had been developed by the Bell &
Howell company.This perforation had many advantages.Predominantly,
it was strong and, as the dies needed to punch the perforations could
easily be manufactured to a high degree of accuracy, was consistently
uniform in both its positioning and size.
Howell had devised his punch by taking a piece of round drill stock
0.110in. in diameter and grinding two parallel ﬂats on it 0.073in. apart,
this becoming the height of the perforation. The resultant shape of
Howell’s perforation can be seen in Figure 6.12.

One problem in the early days when nitrate base was still being
used was the propensity of the base to stretch when wet in the pro-
cessing chemicals and then shrink back, on drying, to a dimension
smaller than it started out. This resulted in a problem when trying to
contact print a shrunk negative onto an as yet unshrunk positive piece
of ﬁlm – they were not the same length and the perforations were now
on different spacings.
The solution to this problem was to perforate the negative and posi-
tive stock with the separation of the perforations, or their pitch, ini-
tially different, so that after processing and shrinking the negative had
a resultant perforation pitch the same as the unprocessed positive.
While the Bell & Howell perforation was perfect for a negative
stock that requires maximum accuracy and only has to run through
the camera gate once and a printing machine a few times, it was not
ideal for print stock, which has to run through a projector many, many
times. The problem was that, as can be seen in Figure 6.12, the join
between the curved section of its shape and the straight line section
results in a sharp corner, and this corner was prone to tearing after
being run through a projector many times.
A different perforation was then devised, as shown in Figure 6.13,
where the shape is more square and all the corners are rounded. This
gives the positive perforation much more strength, though it is harder
to manufacture the punches for perforating positive perforations to
the same tolerances as the negative perforation. The positive perfor-
ation is known as the Kodak perforation.
Things changed with the advent of triacetate ﬁlm base, as triacetate
does not shrink after processing anything like as much as the old nitrate
stock. The pitch of the perforations had, therefore, to be changed, so
that with the new base the processed negative and the unprocessed
positive had, again, the same dimensions when coming into contact in
the printing machine.
You may hear reference to negatives having either long pitch, the
old standard, or short pitch, the newer standard. You need not worry
about this when ordering stock, as unless you make a very speciﬁc
request it will always come as the modern, short pitch.
The old, long pitch is only used nowadays for very specialized appli-
cations, such as when several ﬁlm strips are run through the gate of the
camera at the same time – as in some forms of process photography.
For 35mm, the consistency and accuracy of perforating is vital to
the steadiness of the image. The majority of both camera and projec-
tor mechanisms in use today locate the image using only the perfor-
ations. In the camera, this is usually achieved by inserting register pins
into two or four perforations after the claw has pulled down the ﬁlm;
they are then left in place for the duration of the exposure, being with-
drawn after the shutter has closed ready for the next pull-down. In a
projector mechanism, the usual arrangement is to have the ﬁlm pulled
through the gate by a rotating sprocket, which is locked absolutely
rigid for the period the shutter is open.This is usually achieved using a
device known as a Maltese cross. The beneﬁt of using a Maltese cross
mechanism in the projector is that as the ﬁlm is wrapped around at
least half of the sprocket, many of the perforations are used to pull the
ﬁlm through the gate and this mechanism is therefore very kind to the
ﬁlm, so that it may be shown many times without damage.The Maltese
cross has not been used as a camera mechanism for perhaps 90 years,
Figure 6.13 Kodak’s positive

Practical Cinematography
its disadvantage being that it creates quite a lot of vibration and noise.
However, this is no disadvantage in a projection room isolated from
the audience and where the projector is large and heavy, thus absorb-
ing the vibration.
For 16mm, things are a little different.While some cameras still util-
ize a register pin, even they usually only deploy one. Some cameras
manage to give very good registration without a register pin at all.
Virtually all cameras, with the exception of the Mitchell and Panaﬂex
16mm cameras, use edge guides in the ﬁlm gate to add accuracy to the
positioning of the images on the negative. Some cameras use rigid
guides both sides of the ﬁlm and others use a rigid guide one side with
a sprung guide the other to absorb any variation in the slit width of the
ﬁlm.This clearly makes the quality of the slitting process more critical
in most 16mm cameras than their 35mm counterparts.
Edge numbers
You may have thought of the little numbers printed on the ﬁlm,between
the perforations, as pretty irrelevant – they are not. In fact, to certain
parts of our industry, they are the very stuff of life.There are two very
different functions carried out by these apparently insigniﬁcant numbers.
Firstly, there is a number that doesn’t change throughout the roll: this
is the manufacturer’s batch number, which tells you the maker, the
type of ﬁlm, the emulsion number, the parent roll number and the per-
forator number.
All this information becomes vital in the unlikely event of there being
a fault in the manufacture of the stock since,by decoding the batch num-
ber, the manufacturer can not only deduce where in their factory the
fault lies but, perhaps more importantly, they can immediately contact
any other customer who may be about to use the same batch and replace
that batch so as to prevent them shooting on possibly faulty stock.
It is vital that this batch number reaches the laboratory correctly
because, until the ﬁlm is developed, the batch number cannot be read
as it is applied as a photographic exposure; it is therefore referred to
as latent image edge signing.Years ago, some manufacturers mechan-
ically printed the batch number on the edge of the ﬁlm, but this prac-
tice is now redundant.
The second number to be printed regularly down the side of the ﬁlm
does not remain the same: it changes every single time it is printed.
Again, it is a latent image. This number is there so that when post-
production is ﬁnished, and the neg. cutters are about to cut the master
negative, it is possible to match this ﬁnal cut to the negative by using
these numbers. Kodak, by the way, call their version of these numbers
a Key Kode.
If the ﬁlm has been cut in the traditional manner,by having a rush print
made and physically cutting this print,then the edge numbers on the neg-
ative will be printed through onto the print stock together with the image.
They can then be read off and a list of cuts made up for the neg. cutter.
By far the most common way of cutting a picture nowadays is using
a non-linear computer editing machine. Here the negative will have
been directly transferred to videotape and this tape will have been
played into the editing computer’s random access memory.At the same
time, the edge numbers, or Key Kode, will have been automatically

logged and their relative position will be transferred to a separate part
of the computer memory.
This transfer of information is possible because every Key Kode, or
its equivalent, is printed onto the negative in two forms: a string of
conventional numbers (referred to as the man-readable numbers) and
a bar code (just like those found in the supermarket).These bar codes
can easily be read by a scanner as the negative passes through the
telecine during the neg.-to-tape transfer process.These are referred to
as the machine-readable numbers.
If the picture has been cut using a non-linear process such as Avid
or Lightworks, then at the end of the editing, when a ﬁnal cut has been
agreed, the computer can be used to produce an edit decision list.The
edit decision list can be transferred to a ﬂoppy disk or be printed out
as hard copy. From this list it is easy to see, in one column, all the cuts
as the edge sign number plus the number of frames to the actual last
frame before the cut. This list is then sent to the neg. cutters to make
up the ﬁnal cut neg. for printing.
Care, shipping and handling
Although ﬁlm stock is a fairly robust medium,certain precautions should
be taken to keep it in perfect condition, especially before the image has
been processed.The main threats to image quality degradation are:
1
Temperature
2
Humidity
3
Fogging from gases or radiation.
Even when kept in perfect storage conditions, it is advisable to use the
ﬁlm within six months of purchase. If you are travelling abroad it is
worth remembering that most stock manufacturers offer a service of
payment in your home country and collection from their nearest agent
to your location. In this way, you are at least assured that no deteri-
oration by any means has occurred before you start shooting.
Figure 6.14 shows the ranges of both temperature and humidity that
most manufacturers recommend for storing motion picture ﬁlm.
The actual speed of the ﬁlm will have an effect on the rate of or sus-
ceptibility to various kinds of damage.This is particularly true of X-ray
radiation, where the more sensitive the ﬁlm is to visible light, the more
sensitive it will be to X-rays.
When shipping undeveloped ﬁlm stock, great care must be exercised
to reduce the amount of X-ray radiation the stock is subjected to.
If you have to travel with your ﬁlm stock always take it in hand bag-
gage. Checked baggage that goes in the hold may receive far more radi-
ation than hand baggage and ﬁlm can be completely ruined. Take with
you a changing bag and a spare, empty, ﬁlm tin, together with a ﬁlm bag.
With luck you may be able to persuade the check-in personnel to do a
hand-search of your ﬁlm. This is far safer than letting it go through any
X-ray machine, even if they are labelled ‘Film Safe’. For our purposes it
is best to assume there is no such thing as a ﬁlm-safe X-ray machine.
It is often possible to ring the customs department in advance and
warn them of your problem and ask for their co-operation when you
get to the barrier.

The effect of X-ray radiation on your ﬁlm will be cumulative. This
means that the more often it is X-rayed, the more the X-ray exposure
will build up until it reaches the level where it is noticeable within 
the image. Therefore, if you are travelling through several airports
before you can have your ﬁlm processed, try and get them all to hand-
search your ﬁlm stock. It can be very tedious, but every time you suc-
ceed you greatly reduce the chances of any noticeable X-ray fog on
your negative.
An alternative is to employ a shipping agent who specializes in the
ﬁlm business. Because they become well known and trusted at the air-
port they work from, they can very often solve your problems very
easily.The manufacturer of the particular stock you are using will most
likely be able to advise you as to reliable shipping agents in the areas
through which you are planning to travel.
As to deterioration through excessive temperature and humidity,
common sense is all that is needed to avoid any problems. By looking
at Figure 6.14 you can check the parameters that are acceptable. If you
are likely to be going to parts of the world where you may encounter
a problem, then any photographic shop specializing in darkroom
equipment will sell you a robust thermometer and hygrometer at very
little cost; you can then use these to keep a check on matters. In
extremely hot conditions, you may be able to negotiate with the hotel
chef to put the majority of your stock in a fridge. A good quality cool
bag (the Australians call it an ‘Esky’) should be used for the stock you
need that day only. It is most important that you let any ﬁlm that has
been in a fridge come up to temperature before you load it into a mag-
azine – if you don’t, condensation will form. If the nights are reason-
ably cool, then take the ﬁlm from the fridge late in the evening and put
it into your cool bag ﬁrst thing in the morning.
However careful you have been while travelling, always have the
ﬁlm processed as soon as possible after exposure. If you are really
worried about any adverse effects, you might consider having the ﬁlm
processed in the country you are working in. If the laboratory seems
reasonably good, you can always send a test roll in before committing
the majority of your rushes to them.Again, asking your stock supplier
will usually elicit an opinion, albeit a guarded one, as to the reliability
of any laboratory.

Basic sensitometry
For some reason, most ﬁlm technicians ﬁnd sensitometry either boring
or frightening. This is unfortunate, since with only a basic knowledge
of the photographic process and the ability to do your two times table,
you can master all you need to know to gain considerably more control
over your picture making.
Sensitometry, as the word would suggest, is the technique we use for
measuring and evaluating the sensitivity of a ﬁlm emulsion to light.
The important part of the evaluation, to cinematographers, is to know
how much light arriving at the emulsion is needed to produce the
required density of image on the ﬁlm after development.The relation-
ship between the amount of light, the exposure and the darkening, the
density, will not be in the same ratio over the entire range of bright-
ness recorded on the ﬁlm.This is important, since in creating the mood
of the ﬁnal picture the cinematographer will be very concerned to
know how much detail will be seen in the shadowed part of the image
and, particularly if outdoors, will wish to know the details that can be
recorded in the highlights of the scene so as to know if sky, sand, snow,
etc. will be represented faithfully in the picture. It is in the shadows
and the highlights that the response becomes non-linear.
In order to understand the relationship between exposure and
density, we commonly plot a graph of the relationship between the
two. Figure 7.1 shows a graph of exposure plotted against density.
Unfortunately, the sections of the graph crucial to the cinematog-
rapher, the beginning and end of the curve, which represent the shad-
ows and the highlights, are nearly vertical and horizontal respectively
and are therefore virtually meaningless.
In 1890, two researchers, Hurter and Drifﬁeld, carried out detailed
experiments into the various characteristics of ﬁlm emulsions. An
important outcome of these investigations was the realization that a
curve relating resultant image density to exposure could be redrawn
with the horizontal axis representing not exposure but, quite simply,
the logarithm of exposure.This produced a much more useful curve, as
shown in Figure 7.2.This curve, which is now universally used, is more
practical for camera exposure as it now alters by a factor that is geo-
metric not arithmetic. For instance, when we increase the exposure time
from one-hundredth of a second to one-ﬁftieth of a second, we speak
77

78
Practical Cinematography
of doubling the exposure, not increasing it by another one-hundredth
of a second. Hurter and Drifﬁeld’s logarithmic curve therefore gives a
very reasonable representation of the way in which density increases
when the exposure is increased.
For many years the type of curve shown in Figure 7.2 was referred
to as the H and D curve in recognition of Hurter and Drifﬁeld, who
devised it. Nowadays, it is almost always referred to as a sensitometric
curve or as a ﬁlm’s characteristic curve – because that is what it
describes, the characteristics of the emulsion.
There are several useful pieces of information that can be derived
from a characteristic curve.Firstly,and most importantly for 80 per cent
of our image is the middle section of the curve that, somewhat con-
trary to its name, should be almost straight. Any scene brightnesses
that fall on this section of the curve will produce densities that have a
straightforward relationship to any other brightnesses falling on this
straight-line section. It is therefore very easy to know, over this section
of the curve, which scene brightnesses produce what densities.
The ends of the curve in Figure 7.3 are clearly curved. At the lower
curved section, which we refer to as the toe of the curve, the straight-
line section progressively ﬂattens out until it becomes horizontal. As
you can see from the brightness wedge below the graph, this is where
we will be recording the shadow detail. As, emotionally, the audience

will have a greater interest in what is going on in the shadows, a know-
ledge of the type and shape of this toe of the curve for the ﬁlm we are
using can give the cinematographer a greater command of their story-
telling powers. At the other, higher, end of the curve, where the high-
lights are going to be recorded, again the straight line rounds off to the
horizontal; this section of the characteristic curve we call the shoulder.
There is another important aspect of the characteristic curve in
which we, as cinematographers, need to take an interest. It is com-
monly referred to as the gamma of the emulsion and is represented by
the Greek letter of that name – . The gamma is the measurement of
the rate of change of the densities created as the exposure changes. It
is, in fact, a very simple measurement. One simply measures the angle
of the straight-line section of the characteristic curve to the horizontal
and takes the tangent of this angle from a scientiﬁc calculator or a set
of logarithmic tables – the resultant ﬁgure is the gamma.
The tangent of 45° is 1; therefore, a characteristic curve with a
straight-line section of 45° will have a  of 1. In this case, there will be
a straight 1:1 relationship between exposure and resultant density.
The speed of the ﬁlm, or how sensitive to light it is, is often referred
to as its ASA speed. This speed rating comes from a formula devised
by the American Standards Association, hence ASA speed, but is now
more commonly referred to as a ﬁlm’s ISO (International Standards
Organization).The number usually remains the same. In sensitometric
terms, ﬁlms of differing sensitivity, or speed, can be expected to have
their characteristic curve in a different position on the graph paper.
Figure 7.4 shows three ﬁlms that only have one differing characteristic –
their speed or sensitivity.
In Figure 7.4, the dotted lines show the different exposures required
to produce the same density on different negatives. The pale line rep-
resents a slow ﬁlm having a low ASA speed. To produce the required
density, this ﬁlm needs a lot of light or a bright part of the scene. The
medium-speed ﬁlm, shown as the middle of the three curves, requires
less exposure to produce the required density and the high-speed ﬁlm
on the left of the three requires very little. The high-speed ﬁlm there-
fore will produce a medium density from a reasonably dark object,
whereas the slow ﬁlm would need to be looking at a much brighter
object to produce the same resultant density.
Another characteristic the cinematographer needs to be aware of is
the relative contrast of the ﬁlm in use. Contrast and gamma are often

confused. As we have seen, gamma is a measurement of the rate of
change of the exposure–density relationship. Contrast refers to the
brightness range and the gradation between the highlights and the
shadows; it is therefore expressed as a ratio. For instance, a television
picture, even on a perfectly set-up screen, will only be able to show a
brightness range equivalent to ﬁve stops of exposure; it will therefore
have a contrast range of 32:1, as shown in Figure 7.5. The contrast
range that can be shown on a ﬁrst-class cinema screen is the equiva-
lent of seven stops of exposure. Recently, developments in the con-
struction of camera negative emulsions have made it possible to
manufacture a negative able to record the equivalent of 10 stops of
brightness; this gives the ﬁlm a contrast ratio of an incredible 1024:1.
The value of this range to the working cinematographer is discussed in
Chapter 11.
Despite the deﬁnitions above, we still think of a ‘contrasty’ ﬁlm as
one having severe blacks and whites with little information in the mid-
tones. This kind of image would probably be described in sensitomet-
ric terms as having a high gamma, i.e. one having a steep straight-line
section, as shown in Figure 7.6. It would, in all probability, have a low

contrast ratio. As can be seen by comparing the curves in Figure 7.6,
by increasing the gamma and steepening the curve the usable straight-
line section relates to a shorter distance along the exposure axis, thus
the contrast ratio will be lower.We must learn to recognize the differ-
ence between contrast expressed as a ratio and apparent contrast as a
‘soot and whitewash’ image.
In all the graphs shown in this chapter you will see that the curve
never reaches zero on the vertical density line.This is because the ﬁlm
can never be made absolutely clear, i.e. having a density of zero.This is
mainly the result of two things:
1
The base material it is coated on is not completely clear.
2
When ﬁlm is manufactured it receives an almost imperceptible
exposure from things other than light. The ﬁlm emulsion is very
slightly sensitive to pressure, heat, etc. and therefore the actual
process of manufacture causes a very slight darkening.
The resultant small density at the very bottom of the curve we there-
fore call the base level fog.

The laboratory
The laboratory contact
The laboratory contact person (always referred to as the ‘lab contact’)
is one of the more important people in a DP’s life. Every morning,
usually somewhere between 7.30 and 8.00, a member of the camera
crew will be detailed to phone the lab. This is to obtain the report on
yesterday’s rushes,or dailies as they are known in the USA.The report
will contain information as to how well the contact thought the over-
all look of the rushes had been achieved, an accurate list of any hairs
or scratches with precise slate numbers and the all-important printer
lights. The printer lights are usually given in the order of red, green
and blue with, often, an average of all three colours for each scene or
roll.This is known as an overall light and is an expression of the over-
all exposure.
The overall exposure ﬁgure will only be of use if you have been
working under normal lighting conditions. If you have been shifting
your colours using the grey scale or, for instance, shooting under ﬂuo-
rescent lighting, you will need to interpret the RGB (Red, Green,
Blue) numbers.
Your laboratory contact will have been responsible for setting the
grading lights the night before and can therefore have a huge effect on
the look of the DP’s work. For this reason, it is always wise to talk to
the lab contact before starting a picture; this way they know what you
are trying to achieve. For the same reason, I always try and make that
early morning call myself, not just to get a feel for yesterday’s work
but to discuss what we are going to be shooting today, so the contact
has some idea of what I had in mind when they come to grade the neg-
ative in the small hours of the morning.
If you are working on one set for several days, it is a good idea to
invite the lab contact on to the set.They spend so much of their life in
the dark they are usually only too grateful for the chance of a visit.
More importantly, it lets them see the real thing and this makes their
involvement in the production all the more real.

Printer lights
The printer lights quoted by the lab are derived from the ﬁrst printing
machine that had a truly successful light source with which to control
a mixture of red, green and blue lights within very ﬁne degrees. This
was, and is, the Bell & Howell Model C printer.
Figure 8.1 shows a schematic diagram of the Model C’s light source.
White light from a simple tungsten source is ﬁrst put through a con-
denser lens so as to form an organized beam. The beam of light then
arrives at a diachroic mirror,which will reﬂect red light but is transpar-
ent to green and blue light. The beam continues until it reaches the
second mirror, which will only reﬂect green light and is transparent to
blue light. The beam continues further to the last mirror, which will
only reﬂect blue light.
All of the individual beams, one each for these three colours, now
pass through their own, separate iris. Each iris is identical and has 50
carefully graduated settings, where the difference between all the set-
tings is usually equivalent to one-sixth of a stop on a camera lens.
Using simple mirrors, and a second condenser lens, all the three
colours are then recombined into a homogeneous light source. This
light source then delivers its beam to the printer gate.
If all three irises controlling the individual primary colours were set
to their middle position, light 25 on the scale, then pure white light
would be delivered to the printer’s gate. Things are so arranged that
this would also, normally, be the perfect exposure for a perfectly
exposed negative being printed onto a standard print stock.We would
then know that if the laboratory reported RGB printer lights of
25,25,25, our negative was perfectly exposed and had printed most 
satisfactorily.

Practical Cinematography
Not all negatives have exactly the same colour balance, and neither
do all print stocks. It is therefore important, before you start a picture,
to ask the contact person what they would consider to be the perfect
printer lights for the combination of negative and positive ﬁlm stocks
you are going to be using. If you are shooting for television only, and
producing your ﬁnal transmission tape directly from the negative, they
may suggest slightly higher printer lights – that is, the negative should
be given a little more exposure, as this usually suits the telecine
machines and delivers a better overall feel to the television picture.
It is important to remember that a variation of six printer lights
more or less relates to one stop of exposure on the camera. Do check
with the actual laboratory you are going to use, as some will use six
lights to a stop and some use eight.
Contact printing
Nearly all rushes prints are made on high-speed contact printing
machines.These are very much like the schematic diagram (Figure 8.2),
where a light source similar to the Bell & Howell Model C described
above delivers its output via a prism to the centre of a hollow sprocket
wheel. Wrapped around that sprocket is, on the inside, the processed
negative with its emulsion facing upwards.Wrapped on the outside of
that is the raw positive stock with its emulsion facing inwards. The
emulsions of the two ﬁlms are therefore in direct contact.
This simple and very effective arrangement enables the laboratory
to print the rushes overnight at very high speed.This is essential since
all the productions they are handling every night will expect their
reports ﬁrst thing in the morning.
Because the image on the negative emulsion is in direct contact with
the emulsion on the positive, a contact print will be of very high 
optical quality.
Optical printers
Figure 8.3 shows the layout of an optical printer. Optical printers are
very different from contact printers. Both the negative and the posi-
tive are held in independent gates and are simultaneously moved

through these gates one frame at a time by linked intermittent mech-
anisms. In order to transfer the image from the negative to the positive
ﬁlm, an objective lens is positioned between the two gates.
The purpose of this layout is to enable optical effects, such as fades
and dissolves, to be achieved. A dissolve is made by ﬁrst printing 
the outgoing shot and fading out the printer light. The positive ﬁlm is
then rewound and the incoming shot replaces the outgoing shot. The
printer is then restarted and the light source faded in over the same
section of print stock. This produces a situation where the outgoing
image is reduced in exposure at exactly the place on the positive where
the incoming exposure is increasing. Therefore, the overall exposure
from the two negatives always adds up to the full, correct, exposure.
Although an optical printer can achieve many elegant effects, it
does have two distinct disadvantages. Firstly, because it has, by its very
needs and design, an intermittent mechanism, it cannot be run at any-
thing like the speed of the contact printer.Therefore,optical prints will
always cost considerably more than contact prints because of the extra
machine time. Secondly, although the objective lenses used in optical
printers are always of the very highest quality, often being specially
computed for the task, nevertheless no optical path, even if it only
contained air,will ever produce a print as perfect as one made with the
two emulsions in absolute contact.
The cinematographer must be aware that there will be two slight dif-
ferences in the appearance of a contact print and an optical print. Due
to the optical path travelled by the image between the two emulsions in
an optical printer, there must be a slight loss of deﬁnition compared
with a contact print. This is hardly worth worrying about, as the loss is
very, very slight.The second important effect of the optical printer is to
introduce a little ﬂare, again as a result of there being an objective lens
between the two emulsions. Flare is simply a very small amount of the
total amount of light forming the image being lost to the image and
redistributed, evenly, over the whole of the image.The effect of this is to
add a small percentage of the overall image to all the tones in the image.
In Figure 8.4, the effect of ﬂare has been greatly exaggerated in order to

make a graphic representation and the matter more understandable. If
we look at the three sections of the tonal range shown, a shadow repre-
senting 10 per cent of the total exposure,a mid-tone representing 50 per
cent of the exposure and a highlight representing 90 per cent of the
overall exposure, then how will each be affected by ﬂare?
To make this example clear, let us assume that the overall ﬂare is 
5 per cent of the total exposure and add this to each of the tones. The
highlight will increase in brightness to 95 per cent of the maximum
brightness, not a huge, relative, change. If we add 5 per cent of overall
brightness to the mid-tone of 50 per cent, we will arrive at a total
brightness of 55 per cent, a reasonable but bearable change. If we now
add 5 per cent of total brightness to the shadow, which only starts with
a 10 per cent brightness, then we ﬁnd a new total brightness of 15 per
cent.As this is half as much again as the original shadow brightness, it
will be very noticeable indeed and will show in two ways. The density
of the shadows will now appear higher and less menacing. The infor-
mation in the shadows will appear to be reduced, as only two-thirds of
the shadow exposure is now original scene.One-third is just a ﬂat,even,
background exposure. This often produces the unattractive shadows
we hear described as having ‘milky blacks’.
The example of 5 per cent of total brightness becoming ﬂare in an
optical printer has been used to make the point clearer. In a worst case
scenario, it is unlikely that printer ﬂare will ever amount to 1 per cent
of maximum scene brightness, but even so that can be a relatively
important factor, particularly in a low-key scene where most of the
important parts of the image will be at brightness of less than 20 per
cent of the total available.
If you are making a feature ﬁlm where the image may well be printed
through an optical printer several times (see the section ‘Cinema
release prints’ later in this chapter), and you intend to use a reason-
able amount of diffusion in front of the camera, then you may wish to
have just one roll of tests printed up right through the internegative/
interpositive process in order to satisfy yourself that the amount of
diffusion you are using is correct for the release print, not the contact
printed rushes.This, as we have seen, is particularly important on low-
key scenes, where printer ﬂare becomes a noticeable factor.
When a cinematographer complains that they never got a release
print as good as the rushes, it is most likely that they were shooting a
low-key picture, with very thin, underexposed negatives. These thin
negatives will have allowed a lot of ﬂare to build up in the optical
printing of the release prints and this will not have shown in the con-
tact prints.This is the strongest argument I know for always making a
fully exposed negative, even on a low-key scene.
Negative cutting
Some laboratories will take on the task of cutting the original negative
and others prefer the work to go out to a specialist company. It is a
very skilled task and should never be undertaken until the ﬁnal cut of
the ﬁlm has been approved by the producers and has been ‘locked off’.
The negative is either cut to match the edge numbers of the cut
rushes or, almost universally now, cut to match the edit decision list
(EDL) generated by a non-linear computer editing process such as
Avid or Lightworks. The EDL may be delivered to the neg. cutters 

The laboratory

on a paper printout or a computer ﬂoppy disk, or perhaps both for
safety.
If a print is required then the negative will be cut in the format
known as an A and B roll.The principal of A and B roll neg. cutting is
that you put all the odd shot numbers on one roll of ﬁlm with black
spacing between each shot.You then make up another roll of ﬁlm with
all the even numbered shots on it, again with black spacing in between.
On both rolls you make the spacing the same length as the missing
shot, which is on the other roll.
You can vary this technique to let two shots overlap, so that a dis-
solve can be created when the two rolls are printed one after the other.
Figure 8.5 shows how the A and B rolls might be laid out. The ﬁrst
shot of the ﬁlm is on the top roll, roll A.This roll is printed to the posi-
tive ﬁrst. When the shot comes to an end, black spacing is cut on and
thus there will be no exposure on the positive.
When the second roll is printed to the positive there will be no
exposure from it during shot 1, as it only consists of black spacing. At
exactly the frame where the exposure from roll A ends, the exposure
from roll B will start. In this way, one gets a continuous, single length
of ﬁlm with all the cuts printed onto it.
The sequence continues as scene 3, being an odd-numbered scene,
gets printed at exactly the point where scene 2 on roll B ends. At the
end of scene 3, the editor has decided to have a dissolve to scene 4.The
scenes have therefore to overlap; scene 3 continues longer on roll A
before being cut to black. The incoming scene, scene 4, must start
exactly the same amount earlier. When printing scene 3 from roll A
the printer will fade to black for, say, 20 frames. If a 20-frame dissolve
has been decided upon,then scene 4 on roll B will start 20 frames early
and, when printed, will fade in to full exposure for those 20 frames and
remain at full exposure until the end of that shot.
The cut negative will therefore consist of two rolls of identical
length. Roll A will contain all the odd-numbered shots and roll B all
the even-numbered shots.Where no exposure is required from one of
the rolls there will be black spacing. When both rolls have been
printed, one after the other, the result will be the whole ﬁlm on a sin-
gle roll with no physical joins.
Cinema release prints
Making cinema release prints is a somewhat protracted business,
made so by the need for many release prints, possibly in the hundreds

for worldwide distribution, all of which must originate from the single
camera negative. Even if one were prepared to try and print all the
release prints from the camera negative, it would simply not be
mechanically strong enough to make that many prints.
What is needed therefore are a number of duplicate negatives, of
very high quality, from each of which a sensible number of prints can
be made, or ‘struck’ as the process is often referred to.
The process starts with the A and B roll cut negative. This will be
graded and a trial print will be struck; this is known as the ﬁrst answer
print. It may take several answer prints before the director, the DP, the
producer and the laboratory are all happy with the ﬁnished result.
When they are happy a ﬁne grain, graded, interpositive will be struck.
From the interpositive, an internegative will be struck and a print
made from this and checked by all concerned.This process is shown in
Figure 8.6.
If the test print from the ﬁrst internegative is considered to be all
that is expected, then further internegatives will be made. From each
of these internegatives many release prints can be struck.
It is in everyone’s interest that the camera negative, now cut as 
A and B rolls, must be run through a printer as rarely as possible, for it
now represents the whole of the producer’s investment.There is much
relief when a successful internegative has been struck, since only then,
for the ﬁrst time, is there an alternative to the master camera negative
should something unfortunate happen to that master.
On very big budget pictures, when all the required internegatives
have been approved and, perhaps, a safety copy of the original inter-
positive has been made, a single print may be struck from the camera
original A and B roll cut negatives.This is known as the premier copy
and will be used for the one-off showings at international premieres.
As we have seen in the earlier part of this chapter, there is a slight loss
of quality as the image goes through the various prints and negatives
that come between the camera negative and a normal release print. In
order to make the premiere showing as special as possible, these pre-
miere prints will occasionally be struck.
The ‘long-handled’ negative cut
When shooting ﬁlm destined only for television transmission, many
people believe the ﬁnest quality is achieved by directly transferring
the camera negative to a digital master tape. If the negative has been
exposed with this in mind, I am a great advocate of this process.
Providing a print is never going to be required,then the A and B roll
neg. cut can be a hindrance rather than an asset. In order to transfer an
A and B roll cut, each roll must go through a telecine machine on its
own, which produces two master tapes that are automatically, using
the EDL, conformed into a single master tape. The disadvantage is
that it is very difﬁcult to grade the ﬁlm when you cannot see the shots
one after another.
If both a print and a neg. transfer are required, a compromise is usu-
ally to grade the A and B rolls as best you can,conform the tape and have
a ﬁnal grading session from tape to tape.This has a huge disadvantage for
the cinematographer.Once the image is transferred to tape there are only
the ﬁve stops of the tonal range of television to work with.Tape-to-tape

The laboratory

grading,in my opinion,makes the ﬁnal image look more and more like a
video original – if this happens, why did you go to all the trouble and
expense of producing a high-quality ﬁlm master?
To overcome this, a different way of neg. cutting has been devised.
The ﬂow chart (Figure 8.7) shows the process used. The negative is
assembled as a single roll. At each join, a few extra frames are left
attached to the shots so that any damage that might occur during the
physical cutting of the negative is nowhere near the frames to be
printed.The ﬁlm is graded at a single pass;admittedly,the cuts are a lit-
tle strange, but this does not seem to be a great problem.
The digital tape resulting from a single roll grading is, again, con-
formed to the correct cuts using the EDL, as before.This usually hap-
pens overnight. The following day you check the result, which is
usually perfect. If further adjustments are deemed necessary they are
usually so slight that a tape-to-tape regrade will not, in these circum-
stances, be noticeable. If major changes are required it is very easy to
spin the single roll negative down to the appropriate scene and make
a completely new grade. This is then conformed and cut in to the ori-
ginal tape master in an on-line editing suite.
Because of the extra bits of scene that must be left on the shots as the
single roll negative is made up,this has become known as a long-handled
neg. cut – the handles being the extra bits top and tail of each shot.

Film grading
It is quite common to ﬁnd in a DP’s contract either for a cinema ﬁlm
or a major television drama a clause stating that, subject to their 
availability, they will be asked to attend, indeed usually supervise, the
grading at the laboratory.This is the moment for the cinematographer
to add the ﬁnal polish to the ﬁlm.
The process usually takes the form of the DP and the grader from
the laboratory sitting in a viewing theatre and looking at the cut rush
print, and from this deciding what changes they wish to make in order
to strike the ﬁrst answer print overnight from an A and B roll cut nega-
tive. This answer print will be viewed the following morning and may,
with luck, be perfectly acceptable. More likely, at least a second
answer print is needed. If too many answer prints are ordered, then
beware, the producer may start to question the quality of your master
negative or whether you are being just a little too fussy and conse-
quently spending too much of their post-production budget.
The ﬁlm grader will be taking notes during the viewing in order to
be sure of the changes the DP wants.These notes are most often a plus
or minus sign in front of a printer point change number with the
colour shown. A very experienced DP may be able to communicate
with the grader directly in printer points, but this is not essential nor
always preferable. It is quite acceptable to ask for a picture to be a little
more green, say, or less magenta – which, though technically being
similar, sound different and might communicate better your impres-
sion of what is needed. Asking for a little more warmth is also per-
fectly acceptable. Remember, graders are very experienced and very
much on your side, so just about any means of communicating your
feelings of how you wish your pictures to look is ﬁne. It can be hard to
communicate feelings with printer light numbers.
Unfortunately, there is one absolute fact attached to ﬁlm grading –
if it’s not on the negative there is nothing you can do to get it onto the
print.You can only change the brightness of three colours as they pass
through the negative on their way to the print stock.You cannot, as in
still photography, modify in any way the contrast of the print stock or,
other than in exceptional and expensive circumstances, change the
way the print will be developed.
Telecine grading
All ﬁlm, from whatever source, that is to be shown on television must
be converted from a real image on celluloid to an electronic image
stored on videotape. This is achieved by passing the ﬁlm through a
device called a telecine machine. Simply, this scans the real ﬁlm image
in the format to be transmitted, say 625 lines in the UK and 525 lines
in the USA, and then this signal is recorded onto a conventional
videotape machine.
Between the telecine machine and the videotape machine is a con-
trol desk, with which many adjustments to the image may be per-
formed. The telecine can, by the ﬂick of a switch, be converted from
transferring a positive image from a photographic print to trans-
ferring from the master negative, inverting the image to a positive elec-
tronically so that the grading and recording are both a positive image.

The laboratory
91
Telecine grading is, for me at least, one of the more enjoyable parts
of the ﬁlm-making process. It is akin to being a cabinet maker who,
having spent weeks or months making a beautiful piece of furniture, in
one day puts the ﬁnal polish on their work and all is ﬁnished.
More often than not, you sit in a room with subdued lighting, all is
clean and comfortable and usually a telecine machine sits quietly
behind a glass door in an air-conditioned environment. Before you is
a large desk,above which are some high-grade television monitors.On
the desk are the controls, which will modify your picture in almost any
way you wish.
While the rule, if it’s not on the negative there is nothing you can do
to get it on to the print, still applies in all other respects, you can do 
just as much to the image as you could in a still photography dark-
room, if not more, and you can do it instantly!
A ﬁrst-class modern telecine grading suite can not only change the
colours, as at the chemical laboratory, but can modify the gamma of
the overall image or just modify the gamma of one colour. It might be
possible to select one area of colour, a pure blue sky say, and work on
the density, colour and gamma of that area alone. This gives the DP
many more tools if you know that the ﬁnished picture will be 
delivered only on tape. For instance, day-for-night, always a daunting
prospect, becomes much more achievable via a good telecine suite
than when you only have a pure photographic process at your 
disposal.
Do heed the warning, though: it is only wise to use all these tricks if
you are never going to produce a print as well. If you are, and you go
to telecine ﬁrst, many important people might be very disappointed
with the print if they have already seen your highly modiﬁed telecine
transfer.
The telecine process has come a long way.When I ﬁrst became a DP
at the BBC, ﬁlm was transmitted live as it went through the telecine
machine and only for a major drama production would the DP be
allowed to attend a telecine rehearsal. Now it is often in our contract
to telecine grade our work if that is what is required. For some years
now, it has been popular to transfer the master negative directly to
tape. Early telecine machines were really lined up for the response of
positive ﬁlm and, although the image could be inverted from a nega-
tive to a positive, many DPs and producers thought the image more
ﬁlmic if the transfer was made from a print, and in those days they
were probably right.
Things have come a long way. A recent ﬁlm I transferred was from
the negative via a C-Reality telecine scanning at 2000 lines working in
a digital domain. This resolution was maintained right through the
transfer desk, the latest Da Vinci, and only down-converted to 
625 lines just before display on the monitor and recording on a digital
tape machine. The quality was stunning. It would be a huge achieve-
ment if it were possible, at an economical price, to grade a ﬁlm for the-
atrical release this way and make a print from that grade.This can now
be achieved via digital intermediates, often referred to as DI.

Digital intermediates
Why turn a photographic image into digits?
Working through the photographic process from an exposed camera
negative to a cinema release print is a well-known process, discussed in
the previous chapter,and works exceptionally well.Likewise,the scan-
ning of a ﬁlm negative, or print, so that it may be shown on television
is a well-established procedure and has become very reliable.
Scanning and grading a photographic image for television transmis-
sion has some advantages over simply making a photographic print
since, in addition to the ability to alter the red, green and blue compon-
ents of the picture, together with overall density, it is easy, electron-
ically, to alter the yellow, cyan and magenta components, as well as
make considerable changes to the overall contrast. Up until recently, it
was impossible to take the electronically scanned image, together with
any changes made, and return these changes to a photographic cinema
print without a serious loss in quality.This has now changed.
The ﬁrst step needed was to have a way of writing an electronic
image back to ﬁlm with sufﬁcient quality for it to be indistinguishable
from a conventional cinema print – the Arri Laser Printer, and some
others, now offer this capability.
The second step was the introduction of devices that can scan a master
camera negative with such subtlety that there was no loss in picture
quality between the photographic original and the resultant electronic
image.
Thirdly, the post-production suites, that had for some time been used
to grade photographic images intended for transmission on television,
have had their resolution and colour depth improved to such an extent
that they are able to process images well up to full 35mm ﬁlm quality.
So, with these three advances it is now possible to scan a camera
negative, make it into an electronic image, manipulate that image and
write it back to a piece of ﬁlm with such ﬁnesse that the audience will
not be able to tell the difference between a print made by the trad-
itional photo mechanical process and one that has been worked on by
an electronic process.
But entering the electronic world and returning from it is an expen-
sive process, so why would we bother? Because, in addition to greater
92

ﬁneness in the grading process, we can manipulate the image in other
ways that can improve our storytelling abilities.
The next trick was to ﬁnd electronic processes that do not degrade
the image quality in any way, no matter how many times you re-record
them, and this is where digital encoding comes in.
The copies of a camera master negative, in the traditional photo-
chemical process, are called intermediates.As in the previous chapter,
we have seen how intermediate positives and intermediate negatives
are used to allow several generations of copies to be made so that a
cinema release print can be produced. If these intermediates are now
to be replaced by digitally encoded images, it comes as no surprise that
this process has become known as a digital intermediate, or DI as it is
most often referred to.
What do we mean by ‘digital’?
In order to create a digital image we break up the picture into very
small elements or pixels.The output from each pixel, depending on its
brightness, is given a number and this number is then recorded as a
code. In order to make up a full colour image, just as in the photo-
graphic process, there are three separate sections of these codes, one
relating to the red part of the image, one to the green and one to the
blue.The number of options available for different brightnesses recorded
by each pixel will signiﬁcantly affect the quantity of the resultant picture.
More options will give a ﬁner picture with a smoother tone range, very
like using a ﬁner grain ﬁlm.
If you give each small element of the picture, the pixel, the option to
have 1000 differences between recording a black part of an image and
a white part, you will get a reasonably ﬁne picture, but if it were pos-
sible to break up the tonal range from each pixel into,say,4000 options,
then the result would give a much smoother transition between the
various tones in the resulting image.
Even to record a decent image comparable with 35mm ﬁlm, we are
going to need something like 2000 pixels across the width of the pic-
ture and around 1000 pixels vertically. That’s 2000000 pixels per
frame and, as we want to give each pixel at least 1000 options of
brightness, the total number of options we will need to record will be
2000000000. So far, we have only recorded one of the three necessary
colours, so for a full colour single frame we need 6000000000 options.
At 24 frames per second, we are going to need to have a huge record-
ing ability unless we can ﬁnd a way to simplify matters.
The binary code
A binary code employs a combination of zeros and ones in an organ-
ized way to write any value. The numbers of zeros and ones used
determines how many options you will have available.
Just one option allows you to write two numbers, as zero will repre-
sent a number and one will represent another.Yet if we go up just one
step further and allow two options of zeros and ones we can now
record four different numbers, for we have the options of 00, 01, 10
and 11. This we call a two-bit code, where two bits of information are
Digital intermediates

used to write four combinations, with each combination representing
one value.
The great advantage of this system is that one can easily design a
machine, or electronic circuit, to recognize this code, as we can tell it
one is represented by ‘On’ and zero is represented by ‘Off’. So, as we
are only asking our machine to tell if it is on or off to understand all
the numbers we require, we have gained a huge advantage – we can
copy our string of codes as many times as we like, with absolute accur-
acy, and even the most stupid of machines can tell if it is on or off.
Here lies the advantage of digital copying over photographic copy-
ing; every time you make a photographic copy there will be some loss
in quality, no matter how small, but every digital copy should be an
exact replica of the original. We can now, therefore, make as many
copies, or intermediates, as we wish.
But how many combinations of zeros and ones should we assign to
each pixel to get an exact representation of our photographic original?
Well, perceived wisdom tells us we need 10 or 12 combinations of zeros
and ones in order that the digital intermediate process remains seam-
less. Figure 9.1 shows how the number of combinations available with
different numbers of zeros and ones moves up to an astounding 4096
for 12-bit encoding.
Linear and logarithmic sampling
There is a way of encoding the original scanning of the camera nega-
tive that can both make the picture more appealing to the eye and, at
the same time, reduce the size of the digital ﬁles used to store the
images. It involves the use of logarithmic sampling rather than the tra-
ditional linear sampling.

With linear sampling, the steps between each brightness sampled
are exactly the same throughout the tonal range of the master image,
as in Figure 9.2. Because of the shape of the brightness response curve,
a ﬁner gradation between recorded values will occur in the highlights
than in the shadows.With logarithmic sampling, as shown in Figure 9.3,
there are more steps in the area of the shadowed part of the scene
than in the highlights, and this results in the recorded values being
evenly spaced across the tonal range.
There is another advantage to logarithmic sampling. Original cam-
era negative will usually have an overall density range of 2.0D from
the clearest part of the ﬁlm to the darkest. The industry standard
Kodak speciﬁed Cineon (.CIN) ﬁlm ﬁle format for digital recording,
the most widely used in the DI world, works on the basis that between
each digital sample there will be a density change of 0.002D on the

camera negative. If we sample in a linear pattern, the 11-stop dynamic
range of a modern camera negative will need a 13-bit ﬁle to hold all
that data using 0.002 intervals of density between samples.This means
that, in order to get sufﬁcient data for the shadows to look real, there
must be 8192 options of recordable brightness for each pixel.
However, if a tonal range of 11 stops on the camera negative is sam-
pled in a logarithmic way, the same amount of necessary information
can be recorded on a 10-bit ﬁle, which has only 1024 options. This
means much smaller ﬁles are needed but the audience will still see an
image of equivalent quality.
Image acquisition
At the start of the DI process it is necessary to scan the photographic
image so that we can write it in the binary code. The most important
decision is what digital resolution we use and this is described by
referring to the number of pixels the horizontal width of the picture is
broken up into.There is much discussion in the post-production world
as to how many horizontal pixels are needed, with almost as many
opinions as there are post-production houses, so I am going to give my
opinion, and I have taken very good advice on this.
A 35mm master camera negative is almost universally agreed to have
the equivalent of a digital image of 4000 pixels horizontally.Therefore,
if you wish to take a shot, manipulate it digitally and return it to the
cut camera master negative, you must scan at 4000 pixel resolution in
order that no discernible degradation in picture quality occurs when
you make the photographic intermediates.
If you are going to scan your camera master and do all your inter-
mediates digitally, only returning to ﬁlm for the release print, or at the
worst the intermediate photographic negative, then scanning your
original at 2000 pixels horizontally will be enough and can produce an
image on the cinema screen every bit as good as the purely photo-
graphic method described above.
Incidentally, we refer to a picture with 4000 horizontal pixels as hav-
ing a 4k resolution and one with 2000 pixels as 2k.
Why the difference? The traditional route from camera master neg-
ative to the cinema release print usually looks like this:
1
Camera negative – printed to intermediate positives.
2
Intermediate positive – printed to intermediate negatives.
3
Intermediate negatives – printed to cinema release prints.
4
Cinema release print – to cinema screen.
It is an inescapable fact that every time you make a photographic copy
you must lose some picture quality; therefore, if you go through this
process starting with 4k camera negative you will end up on the screen
with something having a poorer resolution.
To satisfy the resolution of an audience sitting in the optimum view-
ing position in a cinema, the screen picture quality must have a hori-
zontal resolution equivalent to 1000 pixels or better. Only then will
they consider the image to be sharp. In order to achieve this, one must
start with a camera negative having a 4k resolution and that will, after
the degradation due to the copying process, give roughly a 1.2k image
on the cinema screen and this, therefore, satisﬁes the audience criteria.

With the DI route things are different, for as we have seen the copy-
ing process here is loss free, so it is perfectly reasonable to suppose
that starting with a 2k scan, and manipulating it at this resolution, it is
still easily possible to show the ﬁnal scan out to ﬁlm on the cinema
screen with 1.2k resolution; thus, the audience should not be able to
tell any difference in quality between photographic intermediates and
digital intermediates.
If, at the end of the DI process, we were to show the stored digital
images directly onto the cinema screen via a high-quality digital pro-
jector, it is now possible to show all of the 2k image on the screen,
arguably producing a higher quality image than a ﬁlm print is capable of.
The 16 mm DI route
Blowing up a 16mm negative to a 35mm print never looks as good as
a 35mm negative. Using the DI option it is possible to scan the 16mm
master at 2k, or even 4k resolution, though the latter will be apprecia-
bly more expensive. If you do that and write out the DI to a print, the
results can be quite remarkable. This is because a 4k scan of a 16mm
master will result in at least the required 1.2k resolution on the cinema
screen.
Deliverables
A considerable advantage of working with a DI is the multitude of
versions that can be taken from the DI master. You can create simul-
taneously, or at any later date, a ﬁlm copy, a digital data ﬁle that may,
for instance, be delivered on a server to a cinema, a standard deﬁnition
tape in any standard for transmission on television, an HD video copy,
a DVD, have the ability to access the movie on the web and many
more formats that exist now or may come into being in the future.
Remember, the DI master will produce a picture for any screen and,
as we have seen, it will more than satisfy the acutance of the human
eye – quite an argument for a DI master being a reliable way to future-
proof the movie.

Exposure meters
Exposure meters measure brightness. Some measure the light reﬂected
back from the scene and others measure the amount of light falling on
the scene.
This chapter considers the matters to be taken into account when
taking a reading and interpreting it on the meter’s scales.
Camera speed
In cinematography things are mostly simpler than with still photog-
raphy.You still have shutter speed and lens aperture, but your shutter
speed is nearly always the same, since it is primarily dictated by the
number of frames per second the camera is set to run at.
For the cinema the standard frame rate is 24fps (frames per second)
and for television we shoot, in the United Kingdom, at 25fps. Most
cameras use a 180° shutter – that is, the shutter is closed for exactly
half the time and open for the other half. Some cameras can vary this,
but we are not concerned with that facility at present, especially as it is
rarely used. For US television 24fps is most common, but when excep-
tionally high quality is required 30fps may be used.
Shutter speed
If we are running the camera at 24fps,which is the standard frame rate
used in the cinema, and the shutter is open for only half the time, what
will the exposure be? As each frame is replaced every twenty-fourth
of a second and the shutter is only open to the ﬁlm for half that time,
then the exposure must be one forty-eighth of a second.
If we are shooting for UK television, then the same logic applies,
though the frame rate here is 25fps and, therefore, each frame takes
one twenty-ﬁfth of a second.The shutter is again open for only half the
time, so the exposure will be one ﬁftieth of a second.
In practice, we ﬁnd that some exposure meters don’t have a forty-
eighth of a second setting but virtually all have a ﬁftieth, which is ﬁne
for the television frame rate of 25fps. For cinema, the difference is an
101

error of 4 per cent, and that in the direction of overexposure, which is
the safer direction.
Before we can discuss the different types of exposure meter, we
need to know a little of how they are designed.
Average scene reﬂectance values
There is an international agreement as to what represents an average
scene. It has been determined that the average surface of an average
scene will reﬂect 18 per cent of the light landing on it.This is important
as all exposure meters are based on this premise – they believe they
are looking at something that has a reﬂectance value of 18 per cent.
We can use this knowledge to interpret the reading that our meter is
giving us.
For instance, Caucasian skin tone, the most photographed thing in
the western world, is clearly reﬂecting more than 18 per cent – com-
pare it with a Kodak standard 18 per cent grey card and you will see
the difference. Fortunately, the difference is usually around one stop,
i.e. the skin is reﬂecting twice as much light as the 18 per cent card, so
is therefore one stop brighter. There will be occasions when we need
to make this compensation – for example, when we have taken a close,
reﬂected reading off someone’s face.
Types of exposure meter
There are four basic types of exposure meter. Some work in different
ways, though they have one thing in common, as we have seen – they
all think they are looking at a scene with an average reﬂectance value
of 18 per cent.
The ﬁve basic types are:
●
Built-in camera meters.
●
Reﬂected light meters.
●
Incident light meters.
●
Spot meters.
●
A ﬁfth type of meter, the combined meter, has recently come onto
the market.
Built-in camera meters
Built-in camera meters can be very simple or quite sophisticated. The
two you will come across most often in ﬁlming will be those in the Arri
SR and the Aaton cameras. Both are quite sophisticated. They take a
portion from the centre of the frame to be shot and give an average
exposure for this portion, adding to this a smaller value for the rest of
the frame.This is known as ‘centre weighting’ a meter, as it takes much
more notice of the centre of the frame than the rest of it.
The Arri SR meter takes a small portion of the light that has been
reﬂected onto the camera’s focusing screen and sends it to the meter’s
sensitive cell via some fairly sophisticated optics. The Aaton takes
quite a different approach in that the photosensitive cell looks directly
at the emulsion in the ﬁlm gate. The Aaton therefore needs to be
102
Practical Cinematography

ﬂicked over one frame to take a reading when the camera is not run-
ning. In practice, both methods are very accurate and reliable.
These meters work very well on an average outdoor scene,especially
if the camera is pointed down to exclude the sky, a reading is taken and
set, and the camera is then tilted up to the original composition.
Their disadvantage is that they make no allowance for any dramatic
decisions from the cinematographer, since they can only work on
averages.
Reﬂected light meters
Reﬂected light meters work in a very similar way to built-in meters –
in fact, they are more or less a hand-held version of the same. Being
hand-held, they do give the cinematographer more control, as they
can be pointed at different parts of the scene to analyse the various
brightnesses within that scene.
Perhaps the most common reﬂected light meter is the Weston Master.
This meter, with some improvements, has been around for many years.
Unfortunately, even in its latest version, it is not very sensitive and can
only really be used for outdoor photography. Nevertheless, as it is a
classic of its kind it is worth considering.
It has a grid that may or may not cover the meter’s cell, giving two
brightness ranges on the meter. As you cover the cell with the grid, a
new scale comes before the needle automatically, giving you the cor-
rect read-outs for the two ranges. An Invercone attachment can be
added to the Weston to turn it into an incident light meter.
Reﬂected light meters can be pointed at an 18 per cent grey card to
give an average reading of the scene and will then behave very simi-
larly to incident light meters.
Incident light meters
As you would expect from their name, these meters measure the light
incident to the scene – that is, the light falling onto the scene.They do
this, in the main, by having a white dome over the meter’s cell that inte-
grates,or adds together,the light from all directions in front of the meter.
This dome is usually referred to as an integrating or photo sphere.These
meters are especially good for exposing reversal ﬁlms.The dome does
tend to collect too much light from the sky, so you will often see photog-
raphers holding their hand above the dome to shield it from this effect.
Incident light meters are also very good at measuring brightness
ratios, especially those where the dome can be replaced with a ﬂat
white plate, making the meter much more directional.
An even more sophisticated integrator is the Weston Invercone
attachment for the Weston meter. Here the integrator is not a simple
dome but a hollow white plastic ring with a dimple in the middle.This
has been very carefully designed so that there are exactly the same
percentage areas of plastic facing each direction as has the human
face.Thus, one gets a very accurate exposure reading for photographing
a Caucasian human being. If you were foolish enough to take an
Invercone apart, you would ﬁnd that between its two top inner and
outer surfaces there is a small piece of paper.This is in there to reduce
slightly the effect of overhead light on the subsequent reading,otherwise
Exposure meters
103

the front of the face would be underexposed.This obviates the need to
hold one’s hand above the meter as one might with a simple dome
attachment.
It is a very great shame that the Weston is really only sensitive
enough to take exterior readings, for to be able to use an Invercone on
an interior lit close-up would be very useful indeed.
Spot meters
Spot meters are a slightly different proposition in that they are not
exposure meters at all, but are really brightness meters.
They work on the principle of having a lens produce an image into
a viewﬁnder, very much like a modern single lens reﬂex still camera
without the ﬁlm body incorporated. In the viewﬁnder there is a small
circle and the reading is taken only from within this circle.The size of
the circle represents, in most meters of this type, a viewing angle of
only one degree. Thus, very careful detailed measurements of scene
brightness can be taken.
To make life simpler, the scale on most spot meters has a marking
that corresponds to the correct reading from an 18 per cent grey card.
If a reading is taken from a given part of the scene and turned into an
aperture setting on the meter, then this indicated exposure will pro-
duce a density on the ﬁnal print of this portion of the scene that will
exactly match the density of an 18 per cent grey card.Therefore, if you
are taking a reading directly from a Caucasian face, you will need to
make an allowance of approximately one stop to obtain the correct
density on the ﬁnal print for this skin tone.
Figure 10.1 shows a scene where the white rectangle represents the
view in the image of a Pentax Digital Spotmeter.At the bottom of this
rectangle is a black box that contains the brightness reading from 
the tiny circle set on the actor’s cheek; this circle is the only area over
104
Practical Cinematography
Figure 10.1 Pentax Digital
Spotmeter viewﬁnder

which a reading will be taken and has an angle of view of only one
degree of arc.This meter makes readings in steps of one-third of a stop
and the readings represent EVs (exposure values).The reading in the
box therefore represents a value of eight and two-thirds; this is then
easily transferred to the meter’s outer scales for interpretation.
If all this sounds too complicated, don’t be put off. The most valu-
able use of the spot meter is that,having once determined the aperture
you are going to expose at, you can take readings of both the 
shadowed and the highlighted parts of the scene and determine if they
will be within the brightness range of the ﬁlm you are using. See
Chapter 12 for a more detailed description of using a spot meter.
If you are using a negative stock with a range of seven stops, then as
a guide you will be recording roughly three stops above the 18 per cent
grey reading and four stops below that reading.
One spot meter has a further advantage.The Pentax Digital Spotmeter
has an additional scale,which corresponds to the IRE (Institute of Radio
Engineers of America) American television grey scale. The television 
system cannot handle the full seven-stop range of brightnesses our ﬁlm
stock can easily record – it can only handle ﬁve stops.The Pentax Digital
Spotmeter shows this range on the scale nearest the operator and has the
datum mark for an 18 per cent grey card clearly shown.
The combined meter
The ﬁrm Seconic has recently introduced a combined meter that, in
one neat package, contains an incident meter and a spot meter. I
bought one recently to use as a backup, thinking it couldn’t possibly be
as good as my current, separate, spot meter and incident meter. How
wrong could I be! The Seconic L-508 C Zoom Master has not been out
of my hand since I bought it.The meter is well thought out with logical
displays and is very convenient to use. The 508’s recent replacement,
the Seconic L-608 C Zoom Master (see Figure 10.2), is even better,
Exposure meters

as you don’t need to choose between a meter with a still photography
or movie type scale,the new meter does both,and it also has the added
improvement of the spot meter reading showing in the viewﬁnder.
Remarkably,the optical path for the spot meter in these meters suffers
from no discernible ﬂare, the bane of most spot meters, this despite
having a four-to-one zoom facility built in.

lar use on a daily basis.They are, from bottom left going clockwise, my

Lighting ratios
Deﬁning a lighting ratio
A lighting ratio is the ﬁgure we give to a measured relative difference
in brightness between two parts of a scene.As opening the aperture by
one stop doubles the amount of light reaching the ﬁlm, two surfaces
where one is brighter by one stop of exposure than the other will
therefore have a lighting ratio of 2:1.
Where there are several surfaces, each a stop brighter than the next,
each time you open the range of your comparative readings by one stop
the amount of light reaching the ﬁlm will double, therefore the lighting
ratio will double. Figure 11.1 shows the relationship between the differ-
ence in brightness measured in stops against the resultant lighting ratio.
Visualizing lighting ratios
It is important, before lighting a scene, to be able to visualize the light-
ing ratio you are going to use. It is very time-consuming to have to
change your ratios after you thought you had ﬁnished lighting the set;
it is unprofessional and the delay makes you unpopular with the pro-
duction ofﬁce.
In order to easily visualize lighting ratios, look at Figure 11.2. Here
the lighting ratio between the highlight and the body of the sphere is 2:1.
The ratio between sphere and shadow is again 2:1. From shadow to the
deep shadow it is 4:1.The chart at the lower half of Figure 11.2 shows all
the various ratios between all the parts of the sphere and its shadow.
Keep this sphere in mind and you will easily visualize all the import-
ant brightnesses on any set.
Lighting ratios for ﬁlm and television
Even the ﬁnest cinema screen can only reﬂect a limited amount of light.
In a very good cinema the difference between the darkest perceivable

black and the whitest white will measure a difference of no more than
seven stops.The black will never read as absolute black,since there will
always be some spurious light,even if it is only that which has arrived as
atmospheric ﬂare, for the highlights in the scene displayed have to travel
through the atmosphere in the cinema.The cinematographer’s lot has
been much improved since smoking was banned in many cinemas.
This means that the maximum lighting ratio that we can display in
the ﬁnal picture on the screen is 128:1, the equivalent of seven stops of
exposure difference. It is important to realize that any parts of the scene
outside this ratio of 128:1 will have no detail or information in them
whatsoever.They will appear as either solid black or solid white.Keeping
all the important information in a scene within the lighting ratio of the
ﬁnal delivery system is therefore crucial to the success of the scene.
When shooting for television, matters are more constrained. If you
look at your television screen when it is switched off, it will appear to
be dark grey. This is as dark as it will ever get. When a picture is dis-
played on the television screen, parts of that picture only appear
black, or darker than the screen when switched off, because of the way
our eyes and brain expect to perceive the relative brightness between
the highlights and the shadows. A strong highlight anywhere in the
scene will make the blacks appear darker still.
Even the ﬁnest television screen can only display a brightness ratio
of 32:1 or the equivalent range of ﬁve stops of exposure range. It is
important, therefore, not to light anything in a scene that you feel the
audience should be able to perceive,even if only as a faint texture,out-
side a lighting ratio of 32:1. As with the cinema, but now over a much
restricted range, any part of the scene outside this range will appear as
either solid black or solid white. Parts of the scene that are solid black
or white on a television screen are far less pleasant than in the cinema,
because they attract electronic noise and, as this is an unnatural 
phenomenon in normal vision, even an untrained viewer’s eye and
brain will instantly know something is wrong. This must therefore be
avoided.

Lighting ratios when shooting for both cinema 
and television
The way ﬁlms are funded these days,with often a signiﬁcant amount of
the production’s capitalization coming up front from television rights
and video sell-throughs, it is important that the cinematographer
knows when shooting a scene exactly how it will look when delivered
on the two, quite different, media.The key to this is the lighting ratio.
The ﬁrst thing to realize is that the tonal range of the television ver-
sion is going to have to come from within the tonal range of the cin-
ema version.This is mainly because the television version will be, most
often, telecined from the cinema print. This, in these circumstances, is
not necessarily a disadvantage. You have probably put considerable
effort into grading the cinema copy and, therefore, much of your grad-
ing for television, say the overall brightness and colour, will have
already been achieved.
At the telecine grading of your cinema print you must remember
that you don’t have to take your 32:1 television version from the mid-
dle of the 128:1 cinema version. For an absolutely normal daylight
scene this may well be appropriate, but for a high-key or low-key scene
or a night exterior scene or snowscape it would be inappropriate.
Figure 11.3 shows the sensitometric curve for a typical cinema release
print.The straight-line section has a box overlaid on it, representing the
seven-stop exposure range that would result in a ﬁrst-class image on the
cinema screen. Inside this box is another, showing the centre section
that would be used to make a normal transfer from this print to a video-
tape. As is clear, the equivalent of one stop of information in the high-
lights together with another stop of information in the shadows will not
be transferred and will be totally lost to the television audience.
By comparing the 128:1 tonal range of the release print shown at the
bottom of the print with the 32:1 tonal range of the video transfer
shown at the side of Figure 11.3, you can see a very graphic demon-
stration of how the range is dramatically reduced.
Just below the curve is a box showing how one might transfer a low-
key, or night, scene to tape. In this kind of scene it is the shadows that
contain most of the information the cinematographer wishes to show

the audience, so the transfer from this end of the curve only will have
all the shadow detail seen when the original scene was shown in the
cinema, but will have lost the equivalent of two stops of information
from the highlights.
Above the curve is a further box showing the same ﬁve-stop range as
the lower box, but now representing the portion of the print that you
would choose to transfer if it were a high-key scene, maybe a snow or
seascape. Now, of course, all the highlight information seen in the cin-
ema is retained and the equivalent of two stops of shadow detail is lost.
It is possible, and indeed quite correct, to select any ﬁve-stop or 32:1
brightness range from the print when making a transfer to tape.
Because this selection process is so important, I strongly believe all
cinematographers should attend the telecine transfer of their work
and should have made themselves fully conversant with the work of
the telecine grader or colourist.
Using lighting ratios on the set
The most common use of lighting ratios is in the control of how we
light the human face. If you have successfully lit a face and you ﬁnd it
particularly pleasing for the mood you are looking for, then the sim-
plest way of noting your success, at least in part, is to record, or simply
remember, the lighting ratio.
If you were lighting a rather light piece with, say, a leading lady aged
perhaps late forties but playing a part written as 30 or so, a lighting
ratio of 2:1 would be very ﬂattering. This is because, with the brighter
side of the face only twice the brightness of the darker side, the 
shadows in the smile lines by her eyes would only be half the brightness
of the lit side of the face.As there would be little difference in brightness
between the smooth skin and the lined skin, the lines would hardly
show – all very ﬂattering.
Using the same principle, but in reverse, your leading man in the
same piece might beneﬁt from a lighting ratio of 4:1.This would make
him,certainly by comparison with his leading lady,a little more rugged
than perhaps in real life, often a beneﬁt.
Were you to be lighting a more dramatic piece, say a thriller, then
you might let the lighting ratio on your leading man rise to 8:1 or three
stops difference.The night scenes for the same ﬁlm might rise to 16:1,
but this is very dramatic – the detail in the shadowed side of the face is
going to start to disappear soon and will almost certainly show as
black on television.
Controlling the whole scene
As we have seen, the overall lighting ratio for a picture that is to be
shown on television must be kept within 32:1,a ﬁve-stop range,and for
cinema presentation it must be kept within 128:1, a seven-stop range.
The most effective way of discovering which parts of the subject will
fall within the acceptable range is by measuring the brightnesses with
a spot meter. A method of controlling the overall lighting ratio, and
indeed controlling all the tones in the scene, is discussed in the next
chapter.

There’s no such thing as exposure latitude
Many photographers refer to a particular ﬁlm stock as having plenty
of latitude; indeed, stock manufacturers often sell certain stocks as
having great, or extended, latitude. If we are to produce the very ﬁnest
images, it is important to abandon all thoughts of ﬁlm having latitude
and use all the tonal range of the ﬁlm.
If you are using a ﬁlm stock with the ability to record an image with
a tonal range covering seven stops (that is, a lighting ratio of 128:1),
and you knew that the image was only ever going out on television,
which can only transmit a lighting ratio of 32:1, or ﬁve stops of tonal
range, then you could say that you had two stops’ latitude, one stop
above correct exposure and one stop below perfect exposure. But why
not go for a more appropriate exposure every time?
Even when shooting for television you might not want to put the
ﬁve-stop range in the middle of the sensitometric curve. If you were
shooting a night exterior you might wish to lay your exposure right on
the bottom ﬁve stops of the full exposure range, thus taking advantage
of the curved response at the bottom end on the sensitometric curve.
This would be very sensible, as the non-linear response to extreme
shadow detail at this point in the ﬁlm’s sensitivity is very akin to the
human eye/brain response and can therefore, in these circumstances,
look both appealing and appropriate.
The same is true of a scene containing mainly highlights, say a snows-
cape. Here you may decide to peg all your important tones right at the
top of the sensitometric curve, thus compressing the extreme whites as
they will sit on the non-linear part of the curve, where all the bright
whites start to go to absolute white.This can have the effect of appear-
ing to extend the information-recording ability of the ﬁlm well into the
shadows, where you may wish to show more information.
If you are shooting with a ﬁlm having a seven-stop overall range and
you are going to show the resultant picture in the cinema, where, as we
have seen, a really good projector/screen set-up can show the full
seven-stop range, then clearly you have no latitude whatsoever.
111

If we are to work at these extremes, or even if we wish to be certain
that we are placing our chosen tones right in the middle of the
straight-line section of the curve, then we will need a simple and accu-
rate method of measuring the brightnesses in the scene and relating
them to the chosen ﬁlm’s recording ability.
Three-point image control
To work to the accuracy required above you cannot use an incident light
meter.An incident meter can make no allowance for the reﬂectivity of
the subject behind it and that reﬂectivity can vary over huge margins.
A reﬂected light meter is required and one where the user is certain
of the exact area over which the reading is being taken. Such a thing is
called a spot meter. You will ﬁnd a full description of a spot meter in
Chapter 10.
There is a very simple way of using a spot meter to very quickly give
you all the information you need for the most accurate positioning of
the tones of your scene on the sensitometric curve of the ﬁlm you are
using. After a little experience you will not even have to think about
the sensitometry at all.
Point 1
In order to establish the correct aperture to set on the lens, take a
reading on the most important subject in the scene.As this will usually
be your main character in the scene, then use their lit skin tone. If they
are a Caucasian then the reading on your spot meter will be one stop
over the setting for an 18 per cent grey card.
As we have seen, the meter expects to be pointed at something hav-
ing a reﬂectance value of 18 per cent and Caucasian skin usually has a
reﬂectance of around 36 per cent. This means that if the skin reads
T5.6 then the lens should be set to T4.You can check this by substitut-
ing the person with an 18 per cent grey card; this will read T4. In fact,
using the card is a very good way of setting this point when the person
is not available. Remember, the card must be placed in the exact pos-
ition of the face and should be set so that all the light that will fall on
the bright side of the face falls on the card.
The only other caveat is that all the readings for this technique must
be taken from in front of or very near to the lens, for only then will the
reﬂectance of all the surfaces in the scene be the same for the spot
meter as for the ﬁlm.
Point 2
The second most important part of most scenes to most cinematog-
raphers is the shadows, so measuring these becomes Point 2 of the
technique.We know that for cinema our tonal range goes around four
stops below camera aperture; therefore, without changing any of the
settings on your spot meter, look into the shadows in your scene. Four
stops below the exposure we have chosen, T4, is T0.9 – therefore, any
shadows that read above T0.9 will just have detail in them when shown
on the cinema screen and any that read below this ﬁgure will come out
as solid black.
112
Practical Cinematography

Point 3
We know that the chosen ﬁlm in this example has a tonal range of the
equivalent of seven stops and therefore will record up to three stops 
of information above the setting for the 18 per cent grey card. As we
have established that the lens is to be set at T4, then this upper cut-off
point will be a reading of T11, three stops above T4.
Now explore the highlights in your scene. Any parts of the scene
that read below T11 will have information in them; any that read above
T11 will appear in the cinema as even, clear, white.
There is one more matter to remember when reading the highlights.
When you get a reading a certain amount above the maximum record-
able by the ﬁlm, the image of that subject will grow, as pouring so much
energy, light, into the ﬁlm’s emulsion causes it to disperse in various
ways. Also, there is a likelihood of lens ﬂare at these very high bright-
nesses. Containing this overexposure within two stops above the maxi-
mum recordable will usually prevent this happening.
Relating the three points to the sensitometric curve
Let us assume we are about to photograph an exterior scene with a
200 ISO ﬁlm we have used before and we know its characteristics
quite well. Experience tells us that with this ﬁlm we will be able to
record a seven-stop tonal range and that we will still get a little detail
in the highlights if they are three stops brighter than the aperture we
have set on the camera, and we still get just a little detail in the 
shadows when they read four stops below camera aperture.
Figure 12.1 shows a scene with the viewﬁnder image of a Pentax
Digital Spotmeter overlaid on the scene. Let us say we were using our
200 ASA ﬁlm, then the reading on the girl’s face, Point 1, would be 8 in
the viewﬁnder.Translating this on the meter’s scale, this becomes T5.6.
We would therefore set the lens to T4, as her skin tone will be reﬂect-
ing about one stop more than an 18 per cent grey card.This means that
camera aperture would now be represented by a reading of 7 in the
Pentax viewﬁnder.
Checking the doorway to the right of the building, the shadow, and
therefore Point 2, we get a reading of 4 and one dot in the viewﬁnder –
that is, two and two-thirds stops below camera aperture and therefore
one-third of a stop above black. Converting this to an exposure we get
T1.0; therefore, the doorway will be just on the very edge of having
information in the image and the door will, most likely, have wood
grain just discernible in the image.
A reading taken on the highlight on the wall just below the dome on
the top of the building is 9 and two dots in the viewﬁnder.As each dot
in a Pentax ﬁnder represents one-third of a stop, this gives us a read-
ing two and two-thirds stops above the camera aperture, still one-third
of a stop within the three-stop limit, so there will still be a little colour
and detail in these highlights – they will not have lost information or
become pure white.
All the other tones
It is now possible to take readings from any or all the other tones and
see exactly where they are going to sit within or outside the tonal range
Three-point image control
113

of the ﬁlm.With a little practice you will be able to imagine the bright-
ness in the ﬁnal image as it relates to the nearest of the three cardinal
positions you have set against the stop you have put on the lens.
Adjusting the tones
If you ﬁnd that there is an important part of the scene that has read a
little above the maximum white but you wish to photograph it, one rela-
tively simple solution is to light the subject’s face a little brighter. This
will enable you to stop down enough to bring the highlight within the
recordable tonal range.You will now need to recheck your shadows to
make sure none of them have now fallen outside the ﬁlm’s tonal range.
More simply, if there are some shadows that fall below the record-
able tonal range, then by simply adding a little more ﬁll light you will
bring them up to a recordable level. On an exterior this might simply
be done with a reﬂector, for instance.
Control for television
Three-point image control works just as well when ﬁlming for televi-
sion transmission. The only difference is that you have only two and
two-thirds stops of recordable image below the reading on an 18 per
cent grey card and two and one-third above. In practice, with modern
ﬁlm stocks, you can approximate this safely to three stops below and
two stops above.

Using the 18 per cent
grey card
The messenger
Perhaps the most important use of the grey card is as a messenger to
the processing laboratory. By adjusting the brightness, and indeed the
colour, of the grey card then photographing it before you shoot a
scene you have, possibly, the most powerful communication tool in
cinematography.
In order to use this tool you must ﬁrst tell the processing laboratory
you need them to participate.You can do this in three ways:
1
Before shooting, explain to the laboratory that, at the beginning 
of every day’s rushes, there will be a grey card and would they,
please, always grade the following scenes to that grey card. Tell
them that when you want the grading changed you will put a new
card on.
2
When the grading is to be changed, always break the roll and start
a new roll.This way the laboratory grader does not have to inspect
all the rushes for cards – they only need to check the beginnings of
rolls.This is important, as it means the negative receives less hand-
ling and therefore has less chance of being damaged. It also saves
the grader a lot of time and this encourages them to be helpful.
Graders are human too.
3
At the top of the lab report sheet, always get the loader to write,
very clearly,‘Grade To Grey Scales’.This is in case the grader who
normally prints the rushes every night is off for some reason and
the new grader does not know you are using this technique.
I have my own grey card which has printed on white Dymo labelling
‘Please Grade the Following Scenes to this 18 per cent Grey Card’.
When that is photographed at the front of the roll there can be very
little misunderstanding as to the requirements.

116
Practical Cinematography
Controlling print density
A technique very often used, especially when shooting a low-key
scene, is to place all the important tones along the middle, straight-line
section of the sensitometric curve and then have the laboratory print
the scene down to its correct brightness range. The reason for doing
this is to obtain a ﬁner grain structure and dense blacks.
You get the ﬁner grain, which in a low-key scene will show mainly 
in the blacks, where the grains are bigger and the exposed grains are
further apart. By bringing the blacks up the curve they will be photo-
graphed on a ﬁner-grained part of the emulsion structure.
The dense blacks come from not using the non-linear bottom end 
of the curve but keeping them on the straight-line section, where they
are more easily and reliably controlled using the three-point system
described in the previous chapter. If the laboratory printed this scene
in the middle of the scale the blacks would be dark greys – just as they
were exposed.
By putting a grey card on the front of the scene, overlighting it by,
say, half a stop and then asking the laboratory to print to the grey card,
you will be making the laboratory print all the scene down by half a
stop. If half a stop is the amount the blacks were ‘sat up’ in the ﬁrst
place, then you will get back a beautifully graded low-key scene with
unusually rich and dense blacks.
Figure 13.1 shows in graphical form how the darker or lighter grey
card is brought back, and with it the following scene, to the correct
print density.
This technique works for a low-key scene. The highlights will have
been slightly crushed if both the negative and the scene have a seven-
stop maximum tonal range, or a lighting ratio of 128:1. This does not
usually matter as, in most low-key scenes, we are rarely interested in
very much information in the highlights.
With the above example you could improve the highlights dramat-
ically. Instead of using a negative with a ﬁnite tonal range of seven
stops, why not select a negative having a longer tonal range? For exam-
ple, Kodak have an excellent 320 ASA negative with a tonal range of
over 10 stops; 320 ASA is an ideal speed for both night interiors and

exteriors – it gives you the ability to print your work one and a half stops
up or down without coming off the straight-line section of the curve.
Shifting colour
The technique described above can also be used to shift the colour
balance of your ﬁnal print.
Let us take an example where you wish to shoot an interior on loca-
tion and there is a window in the back of the shot. Let us suppose you
only have tungsten lighting with you.Also, you want to keep the scene
outside the window a little bright, say one stop, and a little cool, say 
by the equivalent of a half blue ﬁlter, a half CTB (colour tempera-
ture blue).
The above decisions will lend a very pleasing exterior feel to the
scene outside the window.
Now light the interior putting half CTB ﬁlters on your lamps. This
gives you exactly the colour relationship you are looking for between
the interior and the exterior.The exterior is lit by daylight, which is the
equivalent of full CTB, so you have your half blue difference between
interior and exterior.
Assuming that you have tungsten-balanced ﬁlm in your camera, you
will need to correct the ﬁlm to the interior lighting, which is half blue.
The ﬁlter to use would be a Wratten 85C, but this will absorb half a
stop of light and you will already have lost a lot of exposure by putting
the half CTB ﬁlters on your lamps.
An alternative solution is to use no ﬁlter at all on the camera to get
the desired effect. To do this, put the 18 per cent grey card into the
beam of one of your ﬁltered lamps, take a reading with your spot
meter from the grey card and, using this exposure on the lens, run the
camera for 10 seconds.Now take a reading of the scene,put this expos-
ure on the lens and shoot the scene.
If you tell the laboratory that you want the whole scene graded to
the grey card, they will have to remove the half blue you exposed the
card with and will also remove the same quantity of blue from the rest
of the scene.You will now have a print that is exactly the same as had
you used a Wratten 85C, but you will not have had to sacriﬁce the
exposure loss of the ﬁlter.
The above colour correction technique works for any colour so long as
there is sufﬁcient range in the negative to accommodate the colour shift.
Intentional colour changes
If there is not sufﬁcient range in the negative in the example above
you will get crushing in the extreme tones of the colour you have
shifted.This can, very occasionally, be to your advantage.
If you wish to desaturate a colour, say blue for an exterior scene, in
order to create a bleak feel to the piece, then you could shoot with a
short tonal range tungsten-balanced ﬁlm, use no correction on the
camera and correctly expose the 18 per cent grey card using the ASA
rating of the ﬁlm in tungsten light.
The blue layer will now have been overexposed relative to the red
layer of the emulsion. This will have crushed the red highlights and
lifted the blue dark tones to paler tones – this we call desaturation.

118
Practical Cinematography
When the laboratory prints the scene correctly to your 18 per cent
grey card, this will cause crushing of the highlights and lifting of the
shadows in the blue layer; this will remain since we chose a ﬁlm with-
out the latitude to cope with it.The middle densities will return to the
correct position on the print’s sensitometric curve.
The above technique gives a very pleasing ‘gritty’ feel to a scene. It
is much more reliable than asking the laboratory to print for the effect
if they have the 18 per cent grey card to work to all the time.They will
produce the same effect on each day’s rushes providing you remember
to put a card on before each scene and tell them that you want the 
following scenes graded to it.
Developments in grey cards
For many years, motion picture grey cards always came as a two-page
card folder, as in Figure 13.2. One page has a series of progressive grey
patches and the other page has a simple 18 per cent grey sheet. The
custom, particularly when ﬁlming for television, was to photograph
both pages simultaneously.
The grey card worked exactly as described above.The series of pro-
gressively darker grey stripes was intended to be read by the telecine
operator as a stepped waveform. However, this did not really work.A
piece of card, however high the quality of the printing, will only reﬂect
from the whitest patch to the darkest patch a maximum range of four
stops and that is if it is perfectly lit. Clearly, this is not even the tonal
range of the television system, so does not really tell the telecine oper-
ator very much.
The 18 per cent grey card, on the other hand, is a universally, indeed
internationally, known standard and therefore can be used as a means
of communication between the cinematographer and the laboratory
no matter what countries either or both are in. It therefore became the
norm to photograph only the 18 per cent grey card and more or less ﬁll
the frame with it.
When ﬁlming for television it has become more and more popular
to transfer the negative directly to a videotape. This is increasingly
being done at the rushes stage, even on feature ﬁlms, so that those
rushes can be transferred directly into a non-linear computer editing
system.It can also be a very high quality way of transferring a cut nega-
tive to the ﬁnal, graded transmission tape.
One problem with transferring the rushes negative directly to tape,
without making a print, is that the cinematographer no longer gets the
grading lights that gave them an accurate guide to both the density
and colour balance of the previous day’s work (see Chapter 8 for a full
description of grading lights).
Kodak were very aware of this and have produced a very nearly
ideal solution. They produced a very accurate and durable grey card
(see Figure 13.3), on each side of which is a white and a black patch.
Knowing that it is impossible to get pure white and black on paper
they set the very dark grey, masquerading as black, and the nearly
pure white paper, trying to be pure white, at very consistent densities.
They called this new card the ‘Grey Card Plus’.
The next step was to produce a clever box of electronics that would
recognize the signal associated with the image of this card and, if you

combined grey card

so wished, automatically grade the following scenes to it. At the same
time, the machinery will log the grading in points very similar to
printer lights and can be asked to print this report to either a ﬂoppy
disk or a hard-copy printer. The cinematographer can then receive a
report from a direct negative-to-tape transfer,which is just as informa-
tive as they used to get from the ﬁlm grader.
I have gone over to using the Kodak 18 per cent grey card, whether
the laboratory I happen to be using has the electronics or not, as it is
by far the most accurate and consistent card I have come across.
If you acquire a Kodak card it comes with very good instructions on
the back so you can refresh your mind as to how to use it.
Conclusions
1
You can use an 18 per cent grey card to communicate your grad-
ing wishes to the ﬁlm laboratory.
2
You can control both the density and colour of the print or tape
transfer by using the card.
3
You must state your wish to grade to the grey card on the labora-
tory report sheet.
4
Talk to your laboratory before you start shooting and tell them
what you intend to do.
5
It is a good idea to put a message on the card itself to reinforce the
message – your laboratory will appreciate this.

Colour temperature
What is colour temperature?
Colour temperature is important to the cinematographer for a num-
ber of reasons. Technically, it is vital that any light source that is to
appear neutral in the ﬁnal rendition of the scene is emitting light of the
same colour balance as that for which the ﬁlm has been designed.
Artistically, it is important that the cinematographer has an under-
standing of the psychological and emotional effects of the colour of
light within a scene and that they have complete control over this colour.
In order to evaluate and control anything, we must have a unit of
measurement and a means of measuring. We measure differences in
colour temperature in degrees Kelvin (°K) using a colour temperature
meter.
This unit of measurement is named after Lord William Thomson
Kelvin, a British physicist who, at the end of the nineteenth century,
developed a means of quantifying that which makes colours different.
His experiment was quite simple. He took a beam of daylight coming
through a hole in his shutters and caused it to pass through a simple
glass prism so as to form a rainbow effect on the opposite wall. He
then placed a standard mercury thermometer in the path of each sep-
arate colour and noted that the reading was very slightly different.
Thus, he discovered the relationship between the colour of light and
the temperature that relates to it.
Kelvin did not leave his discovery there,but went on to propose that
if a black body, i.e. one having no reﬂective surfaces and which can
therefore only emit light, is heated to a glowing state then the light
coming from it will have a different colour depending on the tempera-
ture the body is heated to. The classic way to illustrate this is to imag-
ine a poker being put into a ﬁre. Initially, the poker is black iron, but as
it warms it ﬁrst glows deep red then a straw colour and as it becomes
hotter still it appears white. If the ﬁre were hot enough, say something
akin to a blacksmith’s furnace, then eventually the iron would appear
to be blue/white.
Here we must guard against a simple confusion. At lower tempera-
tures the colour emitted by a heated black body is red and at higher
temperatures blue, but we think of red as warm and blue as cold.
120

Colour temperature
121
Our emotional reaction to colour comes from nature, where cold days
are thought of as lit by blue light, snow scenes for instance, but we react
to red scenes as warm,a room lit by a log ﬁre for instance.So,remember
the actual temperature required to achieve a given colour temperature
is the reverse of how we emotionally react to the colour of light emitted.
The colour temperature of a source is deemed to be the tempera-
ture of the source in degrees Celsius plus 273°C, 273°C being
deﬁned as the temperature of absolute zero. In practice, we ﬁnd that
there are some slight changes, some physical and some due to the
source not being a black body. Therefore, a tungsten ﬁlament lamp 
will have a colour temperature approximately 50°K above the actual
temperature of the ﬁlament.
Filters and Mired shift values
In order to change the colour, and therefore the colour temperature,
of a light source we usually put a ﬁlter in its path. A blue ﬁlter will
cause the light passing through it to appear more blue, but it will also
reduce the intensity, or amount of energy, of the light. This is because
despite, occasionally, the evidence of our eyes, ﬁlters do not add colour
but can only absorb or subtract colour. A blue ﬁlter will therefore be
absorbing the wavelengths of red light in order to make the subsequent
light appear more blue. It does this by converting the light absorbed
into heat which, as we saw earlier, has a direct relationship to light,
both being a vibrational energy. It is important to remember this, as it is
one reason why gelatine ﬁlters on lamps ﬁrst bleach out and eventually
burn through.
In order to evaluate the effect of a ﬁlter, we must have some unit
with which to measure its effect. These are called Mired shift values.
A Mired value is a mathematically more useful measurement for this
purpose than degrees Kelvin but still represents, albeit in a different
form, the colour temperature of light.A Mired shift value is therefore
the shift in the colour temperature of the light passing through it that
any given ﬁlter can cause to occur.
Before going any further, it should be understood that in practical
cinematography one never has to calculate the mathematics – one
refers to the tables or switches the colour temperature meter to give a
direct read-out in shift values. The formulae are shown here as an
explanation of the cause and effect of the theory.
A Mired value can be expressed in the mathematical form:
A conversion table (Figure 14.1) shows at a glance the Mired values
of colour temperatures from 2000 to 6900°K in steps of 100°K.
Certain ﬁlters have the ability to convert light from one colour tem-
perature to another. The Mired shift value will be approximately the
same at any given starting value.Therefore, for a given ﬁlter, the change
in colour temperature caused will be more or less the same if the source
of light starts at 2000 or 6000°K.This makes choosing correction ﬁlters
very simple.

122
Practical Cinematography
Each ﬁlter can therefore be categorized as having a particular
Mired shift value irrespective of the light source it is affecting.
The value of this Mired shift can be expressed as:
where T1 represents the colour temperature of the original light
source and T2 represents the colour temperature of the light after
passing through the ﬁlter.
The Mired shift value can be either positive or negative. If ﬁlters
deal with changes in the blue or red part of the spectrum they are
called light-balancing ﬁlters (LB ﬁlters).Brown or reddish ﬁlters,shown
in the left-hand column of Figure 14.2, lower colour temperature but
the Mired value will, being a reciprocal function, be increased. Such
ﬁlters, therefore, have a positive value. Bluish ﬁlters, shown in the

Filters that deal with green, or its complementary colour magenta,
are known as colour-compensating ﬁlters (CC ﬁlters). They work in
exactly the same way as light-balancing ﬁlters in that the value is
always added, allowing for its mathematical sign. Figure 14.3 shows
the shift and ﬁlter factors for CC ﬁlters.

Colour-compensating ﬁlters have only a limited use in cinematog-
raphy, as they are primarily available for ﬁne-tuning colours in trans-
parency or reversal work. They do come into their own, however,
when a cinematographer has to work with available light from ﬂuo-
rescent tubes, which often have an excess of green light. This discrep-
ancy can be corrected by putting the appropriate magenta ﬁlter,
magenta being the complementary colour to green, over the tubes or
in front of the lens if no other source of light is to be added.
Filters have another important value, their ﬁlter factor. This is also
shown in the tables (Figures 14.2 and 14.3). The ﬁlter factor is always
expressed as the part or whole of a stop on the lens and is expressed as
a fraction of a real number or a real number plus a fraction.This is the
amount that the lens must be opened up to allow for the amount of
light absorbed by the ﬁlter. Therefore, a ﬁlter factor of one-third will
need the aperture to be opened by one-third of a stop. Similarly, a ﬁlter
factor of two-thirds will need the lens aperture to be opened by two-
thirds of a stop.
Here it is important to understand the difference in approach when
adding together Mired shift values and ﬁlter factors. If you put two ﬁl-
ters in front of the lens then you will combine their Mired shift values,
taking regard of their mathematical sign. For example, combining two
ﬁlters having shift values of 35 and 10 will result in a combined
Mired shift of 25. But if their ﬁlter factors, when expressed as f-stops,
were one-third and one-third, then the combined ﬁlter factor will be
two-thirds and the lens must be opened up by two-thirds of a stop.
Filter factors are always positive so are always added together.
In practice,it is usual to consider changes of 100°K or more as import-
ant, as this is the smallest change the eye is likely to notice unless it is
possible, within the scene, to compare the sources – in which case dif-
ferences down to as little as 20°K may be noticeable. This may occur,
say, when a row of windows have one lamp each outside them, repre-
senting sunlight. In this case, very accurate measurement and ﬁltration
of the lamps will be required to get them all within a 20°K range.
The colour temperature meter
Colour temperature meters come in two basic forms, reading either two
or three colours.The two-colour meter reads only blue and red. It is not
sophisticated enough for a working cinematographer but is useful for
setting ﬁlters on lamps, as this usually only concerns blue and red.

Practical Cinematography
For the professional cinematographer the three-colour meter is
essential as it adds a reading in green.A three-colour meter is required
if readings are to be made from ﬂuorescent tubes, mercury vapour
lamps, etc. As these, and many other sources, are frequently found on
location these days, a good three-colour meter cannot be recom-
mended too highly.
The most popular meter in this category is the Minolta, shown in
Figure 14.4.This meter can be set to read directly in degrees Kelvin or
can have any ﬁlm balance programmed into it. It can then be adjusted
to read in the Mired shift values needed to correct the light source to
the ﬁlm being used. The meter will give both positive and negative 
values. There is also a chart on the back of the meter very similar to
that shown in Figure 14.2 so that the equivalent Wratten ﬁlters can be
chosen without the need to make reference to any other source.
Colour ﬁlm
Colour ﬁlm comes from the manufacturer balanced for a given colour
temperature. That is, if the scene is illuminated with light of the same
colour temperature for which the ﬁlm is balanced, then you will get an
accurate rendition of the colours in the scene.
Figure 14.4 The Minolta
colour temperature meter

Colour temperature
125
Normally,cinematograph ﬁlm comes balanced for one of two colour
temperatures: tungsten light of 3200°K or nominal daylight of 5600°K.
We say nominal daylight since, as you can see from Figure 14.5, day-
light comes in many colour temperatures. However, 5600°K is the
international standard all daylight ﬁlms are balanced for.The standard
of 5600°K is used because it represents a mixture of light from blue
sky with some cloud scatter.
Figure 14.5 shows the colour temperatures of a number of known
light sources.
It is interesting to note that a drop of one volt in the power supply
to a tungsten bulb will usually drop the colour temperature by approxi-
mately 10°K.
For the cinematographer wishing to convincingly recreate daylight,
it is important to understand that the different sources – direct sun,
shadow and deep shadow – will all have different colour temperatures.
There are a number of reasons why the different kinds of daylight
have different colour temperatures. Direct sunlight varies, mainly, due
to the amount of the Earth’s atmosphere it has to pass through and the
amount of cloud in the sky. In the morning and afternoon the light has
to pass obliquely through the atmosphere, while at noon it is taking
the much shorter path directly from above. This, together with dra-
matically varying amounts of water suspended in the air, will clearly
change the colour of the light passing through the atmosphere.
In the shadowed area, matters are different. If a reading is taken
with the meter turned directly away from the sun, but still in the same
place as where the sunlight reading was taken, the light reaching the
meter will be that reﬂected off the clouds and the atmosphere itself,
and this will be bluer than the direct sunlight reading. In the deep
shadow, there will be no direct sunlight and all the light will be
reﬂected – it will therefore be bluer still. This is useful in that getting
those colours right can give a powerful message to the audience as to
the time of day of the scene.
Figure 14.6 shows a number of readings that were taken in early
August in London, when sunrise was 5.28a.m. As you can see, the

Correcting lamps
Correcting may not be an entirely accurate word in this context. We
use it when we want to convert a tungsten lamp to daylight or a day-
light lamp to tungsten. You can, of course, make partial conversions,
as we shall see.
To convert a tungsten lamp to daylight you must put a full colour
temperature blue (CTB) ﬁlter in front of the lamp.You will lose a consid-
erable amount of brightness as, in effect, the lamp has become much
less efﬁcient.To convert a daylight lamp (say an HMI) to tungsten you
must put a full colour temperature orange (CTO) ﬁlter in front of the
lamp.Again, you will lose a considerable amount of brightness, though
not quite as much as in the previous example.
To convert a daylight scene for tungsten-balanced ﬁlm you put a
Wratten 85 ﬁlter on the camera.
Of course, you can make partial conversions for the sake of art. For
instance, if you were to ﬁlm an interior that had a practical window 
in the shot with a daylight scene outside it and you wished the window
to be just a little colder than the interior, thus heightening the feeling
of separation between the interior and the exterior, then you might
decide to achieve this as follows:
1
The exterior you can do little about without going to considerable
trouble, so leave it as daylight, say 5600°K.
2
Light the interior with light corrected to half daylight, say 4200°K.
You achieve this by using tungsten lamps with half blue ﬁlter (half
CTB) or daylight lamps with half orange ﬁlter (half CTO). Which
you choose matters little, it just depends which is more convenient.
3
You now have an exterior that appears colder than the interior. If
you correct the camera to the interior you have achieved the
objective.You do this by using tungsten-balanced ﬁlm and putting
on the lens a ﬁlter equivalent to a half CTO. This ﬁlter is the
Wratten 85C (Mired shift value  81).
Now camera and interior are in harmony and the exterior appears a
little cool.This can be a very pleasing effect.
It has become part of the mythology of ﬁlming that, in the above
example, you should use a Wratten 81EF camera ﬁlter. Please do not
do this.The 81EF was designed speciﬁcally for professional Ectachrome
ﬁlm. It is nowhere near a half 85 and produces some very unpleasant

effects when used with colour negative. One such effect is to accentu-
ate the veins in a person’s face and make them look as if they are a
heavy beer-drinker. The difference between a Wratten 81EF and a
Wratten 85 is a Mired shift of 60.
If you were shooting the above scene from the outside and wanted
to make the interior look cosy and warm, then leave the lighting
exactly as it is and correct the camera to full daylight. If you are stay-
ing with the tungsten-balanced ﬁlm, then simply change the camera 
ﬁlter to a Wratten 85 or change the ﬁlm to one already balanced for
daylight. The exterior will now be colour correct and the interior will
be warm and inviting.
Quarter blues (quarter CTB) are often used on backlights to
increase the feeling of separation of foreground to background.
Night exteriors are often shot using tungsten ﬁlm with full or half
blue lamps. Full blue is often described (usually by those that don’t
like the effect) as American moonlight, as distinct from American
night, which is what they call day-for-night in France.This comes from
its perhaps being overused, to European eyes, in some American ﬁlms.
There is good logic behind full blue, though.
What is moonlight? It is sunlight bounced off the moon and the
moon is colourless or at most pale grey. The light leaving the moon
after it has been bounced off will have reduced in brightness, but it will
not have had its colour temperature changed in any dramatic way.
When it arrives on Earth it will still be the full blue of pure sunlight by
comparison with our tungsten foreground and ﬁlm.
You must make the artistic decision how blue you want your moon-
light to be, but there is no getting away from it – real moonlight is
roughly the same colour temperature as daylight.

Camera ﬁlters
We use ﬁlters in cinematography to alter the image either for technical
reasons to correct the colour of the light to that required by the ﬁlm
we are using, or because we may wish to change the image in some
way that will enhance our storytelling powers.The former is often neces-
sary, the latter much more fun.
The majority of coloured ﬁlters are known by numbers or a combin-
ation of numbers and letters – for instance, 85 and 85B.These are sim-
ply the catalogue number they are to be found under in the Eastman
Kodak Wratten Filter Catalogue. All ﬁlter manufacturers will use the
Wratten ﬁlter numbers for their version of the ﬁlter in their list that
conforms to the transmission characteristics of the ﬁlter in the Wratten
list.A Wratten catalogue complete with transmission graphs can be an
illuminating read once you know how to interpret the information.
Effects ﬁlters are usually described by some term that indicates
what change they will make to the image – for example, fog ﬁlter.
Colour-compensating ﬁlters
Colour-compensating ﬁlters,or CC ﬁlters,are carefully stepped ﬁlters in
the primary colours or their reciprocal colour. They are used, in front
of the lens, to correct the source light to the ﬁlm in use. They come in
small steps so you need a lot of them to be able to cope with any situ-
ation. In reality, we rarely use CC ﬁlters in cinematography – they are
mainly used in still photography to obtain an accurate original trans-
parency, as with the reversal process there can be no correction later.
Colour-correction ﬁlters
This phrase usually refers to ﬁlters used to correct a daylight scene
when shooting with tungsten-balanced ﬁlm. The usual full correction
ﬁlter is the Wratten 85.The various alternatives are:
Wratten
85
Full correction
85B
Full correction  slight warming – often used as 
standard correction when ﬁlming for telecine, as 
this can enhance the transfer to tape
128

Camera ﬁlters
129
85C
Half the correction of the straight 85 – often used 
when interior is lit to the same colour balance, so 
that any exterior, say through a window, appears 
slightly cold.
All these ﬁlters also come with a neutral density built into them. For
the 85 these are available as 85BN3, 85BN6 and 85BN9. Each unit of 3
stands for a density of 0.3,which exactly halves the light passing through
the ﬁlter. Therefore, an 85BN3 reduces the exposure by an extra stop
in addition to the two-thirds of a stop correction needed for the
straight 85. Likewise, the 85BN6 reduces the exposure by two stops
and the 85BN9 by three stops, again in addition to the straight 85.
Skin tone warmer
A Tiffen 812 is very effective in warming up skin tone while having a
negligible effect on the other colours in the scene. This is particularly
useful for a close-up on a cold day.
Sepia, coral, colour effects, etc.
Just as you would expect from their names, these ﬁlters lend an over-
all colour tint to the scene. Sepia and coral do to the ﬁlm roughly what
you will see in the viewﬁnder, but some of the more esoteric ﬁlters, say
tobacco, whisky, suede, etc., can come out on ﬁlm a little differently
than they look to the naked eye. Coloured ﬁlters often absorb quite a
lot of light to perform their trick. If you intend to use the heavier ﬁlters
I strongly recommend you shoot a test under identical lighting before
commencing your principal photography – this is not to say that they
cannot be very effective, it is just rather surprising to ﬁnd exactly what
they do sometimes.
Graduated ﬁlters
Grads,as they are always known,are usually coloured or neutral density
ﬁlters.They are used to colour, or darken, one part of a scene without
affecting the rest of the scene.
If, for instance, you were using a neutral density grad to attenuate a
sky that was too bright, then you would need a ﬁlter taller than the
actual frame size so that you would have enough to slide up and down
in order to place the edge of the grad accurately on the skyline. If your
standard ﬁlter size was 4in.  4in., then you would order your grads
in 4in.  6in.A 0.6 (i.e. two stops) neutral density grad is probably the
most useful – I always carry one. Grads can be ordered with either a
‘hard’ or a ‘soft’ edge. I ﬁnd soft-edged grads are usually the more suc-
cessful. They are usually supplied where the maximum density of the
ﬁlter is either 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9. The lighter one would, for instance, be
referred to as a point three ND grad.
Coloured grads are used less often than simple ND grads. I carry a
full set of coral grads and a few blue grads.With these I can turn almost
any time of day into early morning or sunset, with both effects available
in a cool or warm version. The joy of using them is that what you see

130
Practical Cinematography
in the viewﬁnder is near enough what you will get on ﬁlm, assuming
you judge the exposure correctly. If you are worried about setting the
exposure, either swing the matte box away or take it off and, using a
spot meter, take a reading through the ﬁlters as you have set them.
Neutral density ﬁlters
Neutral density ﬁlters are used to open up the aperture at which you
will shoot the scene.This may be because you wish to reduce the depth
of ﬁeld for dramatic reasons or simply to improve the deﬁnition of the
lens. Most cinematic lenses work best between T5.6 and T8, though
these days it is nothing like as critical as it used to be if using modern
lenses.The most common ND ﬁlters, as they are always referred to, are
the 0.3,0.6 and 0.9 NDs,where a density of 0.3 exactly halves the amount
of light entering the lens and therefore you must open up one stop for
every 0.3 of density you have added to the front of the lens.
Low contrast ﬁlters
Low contrast ﬁlters, as you would expect, reduce the overall contrast
of the scene.They do this by bleeding some of the light from the high-
light parts of the scene into the shadows and thus lightening them.They
usually come in a set of ﬁve ﬁlters, simply marked LC1, LC2, LC3, LC4
and LC5.
The light LC ﬁlters are also useful in certain situations for creating
a more ﬂattering close-up (see the section on ‘Matching shots’ later in
this chapter). Beware though, if you use too strong an LC ﬁlter you will
get a veiling or milky look to the image.
Ultra contrast ﬁlters
Ultra contrast ﬁlters are similar to low contrast in that they will bleed
highlights into shadows, but they will not cause halation or ﬂaring
around light sources or spectral highlights as will an LC ﬁlter. They
also reduce the deﬁnition far less than a low contrast ﬁlter.The LC ﬁl-
ter works with light in the image area – the ultra contrast ﬁlter works
more with the incident, ambient light. They come in a range of eight
ﬁlters marked 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.They are very good at bringing up
shadow detail when used with a video camera; I have achieved quite
spectacular improvements to the shadows when using these ﬁlters on a
Sony DVW 790 camera. The same has proved true when I have shot
using HD (High Deﬁnition) with both the Sony HDW 900 and the
HDW 750.
Fog ﬁlters
Fog, in reality, is caused by water droplets suspended in the atmos-
phere. This causes the image to be degraded more and more the fur-
ther away from camera the subject is. This is simply because it has
more water to penetrate. Fog ﬁlters attempt to emulate this effect.

Camera ﬁlters
131
The lighter ﬁlters reduce both contrast and deﬁnition.The heavier ﬁlters
make things go rather fuzzy so do not, to my eye, reproduce the effect
of nature very well.
Double fog ﬁlters
Double fogs affect ﬂare and deﬁnition far less than standard fog ﬁlters
while having a more pronounced effect on the contrast range of the
image. It is claimed that objects near to the camera will appear less
affected than those further away – I’m not entirely convinced.
Pro-mist ﬁlters
Clear or ‘Classic’ pro-mist ﬁlters give a glow or halation around
intense sources of light that are in shot.They do this without reducing
the contrast range as much as you might expect. Highlights become
‘pearlized’.
Black pro-mists cause far less halation around highlights and pro-
duce deeper, and some say more romantic, shadow tones.
If you like their effects, then which you use is entirely a matter of
taste. I much prefer ‘Classic’ pro-mists but I think, perhaps, I am in a
minority here.
Both kinds of pro-mists are excellent on 16mm as they do not
reduce the deﬁnition as much as most of the other diffusion ﬁlters. On
35mm the lighter grades are used to reduce what is often seen as the
excessive contrast and acutance of modern ﬁlm stocks and lenses.
They come in a set of eight ﬁlters marked 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Star ﬁlters
Beware the use of star ﬁlters – they can make things look like a poor
version of a pop promo. They now come in a bewildering number of
versions – Vector, Hyper, North, Hollywood, etc. Most also come in
various numbers of points and widths between the lines on the ﬁlter
that create the star effect.
I rarely use any but a four-point 2mm star ﬁlter.This is the only one
I carry in my own ﬁlter kit; anything else I so rarely use that I hire it in.
Star ﬁlters also add a small amount of diffusion.
Nets
Nets have different effects depending on their colour.A white net will
tend to diffuse the highlights into the shadows, thus softening the con-
trast and making the scene higher key. Dark nets will often bleed
shadows into highlights. Both will tend to take some of the colour with
them. Brown nets can add a wonderful romantic look to a scene. You
will need to style your lighting somewhat to suit the net you are using,
especially if you have chosen a strong one.
It is not unusual for a cinematographer to put a ﬁne net on the back
of a zoom lens when shooting in 35mm.The advantage here is that the

132
Practical Cinematography
effect remains more or less the same at all the focal lengths of the
zoom, whereas in front of prime lenses the effect is different on differ-
ing focal lengths. This is mainly due to the variation in the amount of
physical net in the optical path. I cannot recommend this trick for
16mm, as the diffusion created, even with the ﬁnest net, destroys the
deﬁnition of the image far more than is usually acceptable.
Be very careful that the net put in front of the lens does not become
sharp enough to give you a pattern on the scene. This is a particular
problem with 16mm and short-focal-length lenses. It will become
immediately apparent the moment you move the camera.
Nets will lend their own colour to a scene – a brown net will add an
overall warmth and richness to the tones, for instance, the darker nets
adding more to the shadows and the lighter nets to the highlights. Nets
will also give a slight star effect to point sources. A candle ﬂame shot
with a black net can look very attractive and ‘Christmassy’.
Matching shots
You need to be very careful when using different focal length lenses
during a scene on which you are using diffusion ﬁlters. Longer focal
lengths will usually need less diffusion than shorter lengths.Fortunately,
these things are fairly WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), but
you have to look through with the stop on – it makes a difference.
Enhancing ﬁlters
These are very unusual ﬁlters that bring out, or accentuate, just one
colour without affecting any of the others. They come in all the pri-
mary colours,though red is for some reason the most used.Both Tiffen
and Hoya produce excellent enhancement ﬁlters. If you are to photo-
graph a commercial with a red car as the product, do not leave home
without a red enhancer – it will bring the car forward a treat.
Fluorescent light correction
The FLB ﬁlter corrects ﬂuorescent light to type B ﬁlm, i.e. tungsten-
balanced, and FLD corrects ﬂuorescent light to daylight ﬁlm. With
modern negative emulsions they are hardly necessary for cinematog-
raphy, as the tubes are so much better these days and the processing
laboratories have so much more experience in printing scenes shot
under this lighting.Remember that if you can light all the set with ﬂuor-
escent light the laboratory correction will be most successful. Mixed
light is a nightmare.
Polar screens
Polar screens are used to darken the blue portion of a sky in colour
photography as well as reducing unwanted reﬂections in particular
parts of a scene. The classic use is to make the colour of a car more
solid by reducing unwanted glare in the paintwork.

They are only fully effective when rotated for best effect – if the
subject moves, say our car, then the effect will change as the relation-
ship of the planes of the car change relative to both the direction of
the lighting and the camera. This is also true if you pan across a blue
sky – its blueness will alter depending on its relative angle to the Sun.
Polar ﬁlters reduce the exposure by one and a half to two stops. It is
often best to take a reading through the polarizing ﬁlter with your
exposure meter, but remember to have the ﬁlter at the same angle in
front of the meter as you will place it on the camera, since the rotation
of the polar ﬁlter will alter its absorption.
Filter factors
Filter factors are referred to as a simple whole number where a ﬁlter
factor of 2 equals a correction of one stop of aperture. Likewise, a fac-
tor of 3 equals one and a half stops’ correction and 4 equals two stops.
If in any doubt, measure the ﬁlter through your meter but remember
to point it at the same colour light under which you will be photo-
graphing the scene.
The pan glass or viewing glass
This is not strictly a camera ﬁlter but the piece of glass, in a holder,
often worn around the DP’s neck.These days it is not a pan glass at all,
but its origins are so strong that the name is now synonymous with
that little viewing ﬁlter and the name seems impossible to kill off. It
must be said that this ﬁlter is often worn, yes by me included, as a kind
of chain of ofﬁce so that everyone on the set will know who is the DP.
In the days when all ﬁlms were made in black and white, it was quite
hard to visualize the scene before the camera, which was of course 
in colour, as it might be seen on a cinema screen in black and white.
Early black and white ﬁlm was orthochromatic (ortho  singular,
chromatic  colour), meaning it was incapable of recording black and
white densities as a true representation of the colour brightness. In fact,
the ﬁlm was sensitive mainly to blue light, which then required very
peculiar make-up,ladies’ faces being painted yellow and their lips black.
Black and white ﬁlm stocks developed into what became known as
panchromatic emulsions (pan  many). These emulsions were much
more true in their rendition of colour brightness, as they could record
some red and green.
Cinematographers who were used to orthochromatic ﬁlm emul-
sions had considerable difﬁculty in imagining the tones that would be
recorded on the new emulsions.The solution was to produce a viewing
ﬁlter that the DP could look through that would, to the eye, give a fair
representation of the scene as it would be recorded on the new
panchromatic ﬁlm. Hence the new viewing ﬁlter became known as a
panchromatic viewing ﬁlter – or a pan glass.
As black and white technology progressed, various viewing ﬁlters
were developed and matching pairs were sometimes available for work-
ing under daylight and tungsten light.
Nowadays, the viewing ﬁlters should strictly be called colour viewing
ﬁlters, for they all try and show you the scene, not as black and white,
Camera ﬁlters

but in colour with the tone scale modiﬁed to match the tonal scale of
modern colour emulsions.
If one is honest, the most common use of a modern pan glass is to
look at the clouds in the sky to see if one can get a matching lighting
state from the previous shot. Many DPs still judge their lighting by
them as, particularly when using a camera operator looking down the
viewﬁnder may be inconvenient, a colour viewing ﬁlter can be a great
help in judging the lighting ratio of a scene.
A good gaffer will do the sky watch for you. My gaffer has
developed an uncanny ability to guess a cloud’s progress across the
sky. He might use his pan glass or a gaffer’s viewing ﬁlter I found for
him. This is incredibly dark and green, as this is the safest colour to
look at the sun with, though he reluctantly admits that in the UK it’s a
bit too dark – hence he is always asking me when we are going to get
that picture in California so that he can make proper use of the glass 
I gave him!

Depth of ﬁeld
The depth of ﬁeld is the distance between the nearest and the farthest
subjects from the lens that will appear to look sharp.‘Appear to’ is the
most important part of that sentence, because in a technical sense only
an image that is exactly at the distance the lens is focused at will be in
focus at the ﬁlm plane. But, when can the audience discern if an image
is, to them, sharp or not?
When an image is shown on the screen, the near and far objects that
appear to be in focus do so because the human eye has a limit to its
resolving power.Any image we see at this resolution, or better, we will
consider to be sharp.The extremes of the depth of ﬁeld are the points
at which the resolution of the eye has been reached.
Depth of focus
There is often confusion between the terms depth of ﬁeld and depth of
focus. Depth of ﬁeld refers to the image in front of the lens, and may
be thought of as relating to the ﬁeld of view. Depth of focus refers to
the elements in focus behind the lens at the plane of focus.They must
not be confused.
Circles of confusion
At the moment of exposure the cinematographer or, more likely, the
focus puller must be certain which parts of the scene will be sharp.We
therefore need some way of measuring the sharpness of the image on
the ﬁlm relative to the limit of the eye’s resolution at the time of view-
ing. Suppose an image is photographed on 35mm ﬁlm and shown in a
large theatre (see Figure 16.1), and we assume our audience is one-
third of the way back from the screen and we know that the eye’s max-
imum resolving power is usually considered to be one minute of arc.
We can now work out the size of the smallest dot on the screen that
the eye can see in perfect focus. We can then measure the distance of
our audience from the screen and, by applying a little trigonometry to
this distance and our one minute of arc, come up with a physical
135

136
Practical Cinematography
dimension on the screen for the largest dot that the audience will still
see as a single, sharp point.
Taking the dimension of the dot on the screen and dividing it by the
enlargement factor needed to bring the size of our 35mm ﬁlm up to the
size of our cinema screen will ﬁnd the maximum size of a dot on the ﬁlm
that will,on presentation to the audience,still seem to be perfectly sharp.
If you do all these sums you come up with roughly one seven-
hundredth of an inch as the size of the dot on the ﬁlm though,for safety,
many focus pullers prefer to work from charts based on a ﬁgure of 
one thousandth of an inch. Then, even allowing for small errors, that
which they have assumed to look sharp on the screen certainly will be.
Figure 16.2 shows a simple ray diagram where the lens is focused on
inﬁnity and therefore the distance from the centre of the lens to the
plane of focus will be the focal length of the lens.
In Figure 16.3, you can see the effect of the ﬁlm plane not being at
the exact point of focus. You can see that the rays are covering a
greater area at the ﬁlm plane than at the exact point of focus. If this
was the maximum dot size that we knew would look sharp to the audi-
ence, then we should be able to calculate which parts of the overall
image will look sharp and which will not.
We translate depth of focus into depth of ﬁeld by projecting the
allowable dot size at the ﬁlm plane forward to show the farthest and
nearest points that will cause dots no larger than that which we have
decided is acceptable.

The ray diagram in Figure 16.4 shows that the far point creates a sharp
image behind the lens nearer to the lens than the ﬁlm plane;this is shown
in heavy dotted lines. The near point correspondingly creates its image
farther away from the lens than the ﬁlm plane; this is shown in light dot-
ted lines.Absolute focus on the ﬁlm plane is shown as a solid line.At the
ﬁlm plane both near and far points have expanded,or become confused,
to larger dots than the original.This is the circle of confusion.
Therefore, a circle of confusion is the largest diameter of dot we can
allow a true point source to grow to on the negative and still consider
this dot to be sharp when viewed by the audience.
As a rule of thumb, the depth of focus will extend twice as far away
from the point at which the lens is focused as it will towards the lens.
Depth of ﬁeld and Super 16 to 35 mm blow-ups
A precautionary note to focus pullers. There are depth of ﬁeld calcu-
lators available for both 16mm and Super 16 that are based on very 
different circles of confusion. The 16mm circle of confusion was set at
around one-thousandth of an inch. Many Super 16 depth of ﬁeld 
calculators work on the assumption that the allowable circle of confu-
sion should be one two-thousandth of an inch.This is only correct if the
intention is to blow the negative up to 35mm for showing in the cinema.
A 35mm ﬁlm,shown at any given screen size,will appear to be about
two and a half times sharper than 16mm projected to the same size. If
we take the 35mm circle of confusion at one seven-hundredth of an

inch and divide it by two and a half,we come to approximately one two-
thousandth of an inch.Therefore, if the one two-thousandth of an inch
circle of confusion on the 16mm negative is blown up to 35mm it will
now be approximately one seven-hundredth of an inch across. In these
circumstances, if the Super 16 original was shot using depth of ﬁeld cal-
culators computed at a circle of confusion of one two-thousandth of an
inch, the 35mm print should look just as sharp as if it had been origi-
nally shot on 35mm negative.There are, of course, several other factors
at play in this kind of blow-up,but at least the circle of confusion on the
print will remain correct for 35mm theatrical presentation.
Super 16 mm and 16  9 television
A depth of ﬁeld calculator based on a circle of confusion of one 
thousandth of an inch has been universally used in television for shoot-
ing standard 16mm. This works very well and produces images appre-
ciably sharper than any television system can handle. The coming of
widescreen television has added width to the television picture,with the
screen height remaining the same. Nearly all ﬁlm for television, at least
in the UK, is now shot using Super 16, and as Super 16 has very nearly
the same aspect ratio as the new 16  9 televisions, this negative pro-
duces almost exactly the same deﬁnition as the old standard 16mm neg-
ative did when shown on a television with the old aspect ratio of 4  3.
Widescreen or 16  9 televisions are sold, particularly if they are
capable of receiving digital transmissions, as having better deﬁnition.
This is not wholly true.There are still only 625 lines being transmitted
vertically, so there is no possible increase in deﬁnition there.The width
is greater and to maintain the horizontal deﬁnition more horizontal
bits of information are transmitted, but still only roughly the same
number of bits per inch of screen width.As far as recording the image
on ﬁlm is concerned, the deﬁnition requirements for a standard 16mm
original shown on a 4  3 television and those for a Super 16 original
shown on a 16  9 television are therefore virtually identical.
The greater apparent deﬁnition on the screen comes from less inter-
ference between the transmitting station and the receiver, and is
therefore not affected by the camera origination.
Depth of ﬁeld of 35 mm ﬁlm when only shown on
television
It is not uncommon to be asked to shoot 35mm commercials that are
only ever going to be shown on television. In these circumstances, the
deﬁnition of the 35mm ﬁlm is so superior to any television system that
the allowable circle of confusion may safely be reduced to one ﬁve-
hundredth of an inch.
Choosing the circle of confusion to use on set
Where does this leave the focus puller and their calculations? If they are
certain that the Super 16 original is never going to be blown up to 35mm,
then they would be well advised to use a depth of ﬁeld calculator based
138
Practical Cinematography

Depth of ﬁeld
139
on a circle of confusion of one thousandth of an inch.There is no point
in working to closer tolerances, as the television system simply cannot
take advantage of any greater deﬁnition. On the other hand, if there is
a fair chance of the Super 16mm negative being blown up to a 35mm
print, they should work at one two-thousandth of an inch.
Beware, though, if a calculator based on one two-thousandth of an
inch is used for television production, as the focus puller will be asking
the Director of Photography for around two stops’ extra exposure in
order to achieve the depth of ﬁeld the calculator is showing as needed.
This is clearly foolish,as focus pullers will be giving themselves unneces-
sary grief in trying to achieve the required depth and, if the DP doesn’t
realize the focus puller is working at too tight a tolerance and tries to
light up the two stops, what would it do to the lighting budget? As a
rough guide, you need twice the power to double the brightness on the
set,so the DP will be asking for nearly four times the power.This is not
going to be popular with the production ofﬁce.
In fact, a calculator for Super 16 based on a circle of confusion of
one two-thousandth of an inch will, for any given shot width, be show-
ing exactly the same depth of ﬁeld as if the shot were being taken on
35mm. This is because, as we have seen, the purpose of the calculator
is to make a blow-up to a 35mm print that has the same circles of con-
fusion as if the original negative had been 35mm.
My own recommendations would be to use the following circles of
confusion in the following circumstances:
35mm ﬁlm for television presentation only
1/500in.
35mm ﬁlm for theatrical release
1/700 or 1/1000in.
Standard 16mm for television
1/1000in.
Super 16 for television only
1/1000in.
Super 16 to be blown up to 35mm
1/2000in.
The effect of aperture on depth of ﬁeld
The depth of ﬁeld obtained by any given lens is affected by two things:
the circle of confusion we decide upon and the aperture set on the lens.
In Figure 16.4 we see a lens working at maximum aperture.The rays
from the far point are crossing in front of the ﬁlm plane and form the
acceptable circle of confusion when they diverge and reach the ﬁlm.
The rays from the near point, on the other hand, have not yet come to
exact focus at the ﬁlm plane but are, again, forming a dot of the allow-
able circle of confusion.
If we now introduce an iris into the light path, as in Figure 16.5, this
causes the rays to enter and leave the lens at much narrower angles.
Drawing the rays around the same circle of confusion as in Figure
16.4, we see the near and far points of focus are now much further
apart.This has the corresponding effect on the point at which the rays
come together in front of the lens – they too are now much further
apart – so we have created a greater depth of ﬁeld.
The effect of focal length on depth of ﬁeld
If one draws lines from the outer edge of the circle of confusion
through the centre of the lens, the rays leaving the lens on the subject

140
Practical Cinematography
side will show the largest object, at any given distance, that we can
consider will be recorded as the equivalent of a point source. Figure
16.6 illustrates this.Any rays that were to stray outside that path would
create an image larger than the circle of confusion and therefore we
would consider them not to be sharp.
It should be remembered that an aperture should be written down as,
say, f4 or f/4.This represents a fraction, where f is the focal length of the
lens and the ﬁgure underneath the bar is the aperture we are to set on the
lens.This derives from the way aperture control came about. In order to
control the amount of light entering the lens,and therefore the exposure,
early photographers would put on a lens cap with a hole in it smaller than
the diameter of the lens.They quickly realized that they needed a way of
getting the same exposure on several lenses of differing focal lengths. It
was discovered that if one took a ﬁgure,say 4,and divided it into the focal
length of the lens and then used the result as the diameter of the hole in
the lens cap of each lens, the exposure would be the same.
So, for a 100mm lens, an aperture of 4 would need a hole 25mm in
diameter, as 100/4  25. To get the same exposure on a 10mm lens,
one divides 10 by 4 and uses a 2.5 mm hole.
If we consider a fairly normal motion picture lens having a focal
length of 50mm and an aperture of f2, given that we have decided on
the size of our circle of confusion,we can work out the depth of ﬁeld.As
we have seen, the diameter of the lens, or its stop, will be 50/2  25mm.
Figure 16.7 represents such a 50mm f2 lens. The short dotted lines
represent the rays that will cross between the ﬁlm plane and the lens
and go out to form the farthest point of the depth of ﬁeld. Objects only

start to be considered sharp when these rays have come close enough
together to be inside the hard lines.
The rays that will form the near point cross over inside all the other
lines beyond the lens, and it is only when they diverge and cross the
hard lines that they cease to be sharp, having formed the far point of
focus at the crossing point.
Figure 16.8 has been drawn in the same proportions as Figure 16.7,
but represents a 25mm f2 lens. Two things change as a result of this
new lens: the ﬁlm plane halves its distance from the centre of the lens
and the diameter of the lens is smaller.The ray diagram is drawn with
exactly the same parameters as Figure 16.7, but due to the new 
proportions of the lens the rays forming the far point cross the hard
lines much nearer the lens and the rays forming the near point do not
diverge and cross the hard lines until much further away.Thus, a much
greater depth of ﬁeld is created.
The mathematics of depth of ﬁeld
It is never necessary to go back to ﬁrst principles and do the math-
ematics involved on the set. Commercially available calculators are
very reliable and are to be trusted.
Before displaying the mathematics involved in computing the depth of
ﬁeld in any given situation,the idea of hyperfocal distance must be under-
stood. Knowing the hyperfocal distance can be useful in practice, for it
tells us the maximum depth of ﬁeld starting with inﬁnity and coming back

to the camera. If a lens is set at its hyperfocal distance, the depth of ﬁeld
will be from inﬁnity back to half the value of the hyperfocal distance.This
can be useful if a camera is to be run unattended, for a stunt perhaps.
The formula for obtaining the hyperfocal distance is:
Of course, all the dimensions have to be in the same form, inches or
millimetres.
Having calculated the hyperfocal distance, it is possible to compute
the near and far points of the depth of ﬁeld. One needs two computa-
tions, which are:
where:
HHyperfocal distance
S Distance from camera to subject
F Focal length of the lens.
Depth of ﬁeld calculators
Look-up tables
Depth of ﬁeld calculators come in three main types.You can use look-
up tables as found in many books on the more technical side of cine-
matography and as supplied by many lens manufacturers. These are
accurate but are limited in their variations, for each page only refers to
one lens and each line only refers to one subject distance; therefore,
they are rather inconvenient to use.
Rotary calculators
The original rotary slide rule for the calculation of depth of ﬁeld was the
‘Kelly’, so called for it was created by a British cameraman by the name
of Skeets Kelly. The original version was purely for shooting 35mm in
the Academy aspect ratio. It came out shortly after the Second World
War. This rotary calculator has, in the intervening years, gone through
many incarnations and is currently produced by the Guild of British
Camera Technicians (GBCT). Figure 16.9 shows a 16mm imperial
Guild calculator.It is available for both 16mm and 35mm lenses in both
imperial and metric distances. On the back of each depth of ﬁeld calcu-
lator are a myriad of other calculations you may need on the set,such as
exposure time to shutter angle ratios, etc., as shown in Figure 16.10.
There is even an HD (High Deﬁnition) version available, though as
most HD cameras don’t have variable shutters, this calculator has met-
ric values on one side and imperial on the other.
Most focus pullers, AC2s, still refer to the calculators of this kind 
as their ‘Kelly’, though younger ones are beginning to use the phrase

always use the phrase Kelly calculator, for without Skeets we would
not have this very useful tool and I think he should be remembered for
his contribution to keeping focus pullers sane. I was introduced to
Skeets by my father and he was a delightful man – another good rea-
son for keeping it known as the Kelly calculator.

144
Practical Cinematography
Samuelson calculators
There have been several generations of the Samuelson calculator, the
latest of which is shown in Figure 16.11. They are more versatile now
in that they will allow calculations using a variety of circles of confu-
sion, and the use of both a rotating and a sliding scale are of great
value when working with a zoom lens, as an inﬁnite amount of focal
lengths can be chosen.
Initially,the Samuelson calculator looks complicated,but I know focus
pullers who are experienced with it to be very fast and accurate. It is a
calculator very much worth considering, as the single unit will work for
all lens lengths, all circles of confusion and virtually all image formats.
Digital calculators
A more recent development is the ability to do your depth of ﬁeld cal-
culations on a palmtop calculator. My favourite is the pCAM depth of
ﬁeld calculator, together with the sophisticated general information
program pCINE. Both these programs work on most Palm-based

hand-held computers, they are incredibly fast and, in my experience,
very reliable. Figure 16.12 shows the screen on my Palm m500 calcu-
lating the depth of ﬁeld for a 25mm lens shooting 35mm 1:1.85 aspect
ratio assuming a circle of confusion of one-thousandth of an inch or

with the lens focus set at 12 feet. It took this program less than a blink
of an eye to do this calculation.
I have recommended this depth of ﬁeld calculator to many of my
students and quite a number of my crews, and almost all of them have
adopted it.
You can download these programs from the Internet. They were
developed by an AC1, David Eubank, in association with Suharto
Iskandare, and can be found at www.davideubank.com.You can down-
load it for free, but as both programs cost only a few dollars I would
entreat you to pay for them – they are exceptionally good value.

Testing
Why so much checking?
There are two reasons for meticulous preparation of all the equipment
and stores you will need for a shoot.
The ﬁrst is clearly your own professional pride and the need to pack
equipment in such a way that the crew can ﬁnd any piece of equipment
quickly and efﬁciently, even in the dark of a night shoot. Also, it is
essential that all the equipment starts the job in the ﬁnest possible
condition.
The second reason, and indeed the reason for some of the more
obscure test procedures, is that the production company probably raised
a completion bond to insure the picture gets ﬁnished and the bond com-
pany will require hard evidence that all was well before you started.
A completion bond is a form of insurance taken out by the produc-
tion company in order that they,the production company,will be reim-
bursed any expenses incurred due to unforeseen circumstances. For
instance,an artist might become ill during production and delay shoot-
ing for several days. The completion bond company will then be
responsible for all additional expenses incurred.
Another example might be several rolls of ﬁlm being found to be
scratched after development. The bond company might have to pay
for a reshoot.It is clearly in everyone’s interest to be able to prove that
none of the camera bodies nor any of the camera magazines were
scratched when ﬁrst loaded onto the camera car at the beginning of
shooting.
For these reasons everything, but everything, must be checked and,
where possible, physical proof of a successful check must be available.
Who checks?
The focus puller is normally in charge of the preparation and will
almost always be assisted throughout by the clapper loader. This is
sensible, for during the shoot the focus puller will be responsible for
the day-to-day running of the camera and the loader will be expected to
know exactly where every single piece of equipment is at any given time.
146

If there is more than one camera crew on a shoot, each crew will
usually be responsible for, and prepare, their own equipment. Occa-
sionally, on very big shoots with multiple cameras, I will nominate a
head focus puller and head loader. This does not denote seniority but
is necessary so that any problems with any of the crews’ equipment
comes through them to me, the DP. This is important as my responsi-
bility is to the director and for the photography, and if all the crews
came to me directly it may simply take too much of my time.
Even on a short television shoot a minimum of three days should be
allowed for testing.This is a continual bone of contention with the pro-
duction ofﬁce, who frequently profess to see no reason why it can pos-
sibly take more than a day and see no reason to ﬁnd all involved three
days’ pay.The reason for three days is simple.The ﬁrst day will be very
busy and long, as all the testing requiring ﬁlm to be run through the
camera must be done on this day.All other matters are put aside.
The following day should, unless the shot tests show major or mul-
tiple problems,be easier.The morning of this second day is put aside for
the careful inspection of the test rushes.These may be seen at the hire
house where testing is normally carried out or you may have to go to
the laboratory to ﬁnd adequate projection facilities. It is essential that
the projector and screen used for viewing the tests are of the highest
quality. I have known occasions where faults have been seen, a huge
amount of work put into correcting them, and they have eventually
turned out to be a projector fault. It is also desirable that the projector
used for this viewing has an oversized gate, so that the edges of the
frame are visible on the screen; these are rarely found anywhere but
hire houses and laboratories.
The third day of testing is required because this world is not perfect
and it is very rare for there not to be at least one piece of equipment,
and there will often be more than one, that is not up to your standards.
This will need maintenance or replacement and will then require a fur-
ther ﬁlm test.This test will be shot on the afternoon of the second day
and viewed on the morning of the third day. If things are still not satis-
factory you are in trouble and somebody may then have to have
strong words with the hire house.
Tests that involve shooting ﬁlm
Tests that involve shooting ﬁlm include:
●
Camera steady tests
●
The frame leader
●
Scratch tests
●
Fog tests.
Camera steady tests
Every camera body you are likely to use on the shoot must have a test
run on it to check that the camera mechanism is registering the ﬁlm in
the camera gate with an accuracy at least as good as the manufacturer’s
speciﬁcation. This is called the steady test. Many hire houses will set
their own standard a little above the manufacturer’s; if they do, then
work to this standard.
Testing
147

148
Practical Cinematography
Steady testing involves running the ﬁlm through the camera twice.
On each occasion a slightly different image is recorded. The type of
images used vary, but all have in common the idea that the two images
can easily be seen to move, one against the other, and many of the
steady testing methods give some measurable indication of how much
the two images move relative to one other.It is important to realize that
it is likely that a very small amount of relative movement between the
two images will be seen.What is important is to check that the amount
of movement has fallen within the acceptable tolerances.
Before the ﬁrst exposure of the steady test you remove the lens
from the camera and, after opening the shutter, mark a small cross on
the ﬁlm emulsion.The lens is replaced and the ﬁrst exposure made. In
order to rewind the ﬁlm for the second exposure it is necessary, with
most cameras, to have a darkroom available that is ﬁtted with a rewind
bench. Most of the hire houses have these. Be very cautious of running
the ﬁlm backwards through the camera as this may,in itself,damage the
perforations and lead to some unsteadiness between the exposures.
After being rewound, the ﬁlm is relaced in the camera mechanism
and the camera inched over until the cross you made is back in the
gate. With 35mm cameras it is wise to put a line close to the top and
bottom of the gate so as to ensure you are engaging with the same set
of perforations. With 16mm, where there is only one perforation per
frame, this is not a problem. Be very careful when marking the ﬁlm not
to damage the camera gate in any way.
The frame leader
Another test that will be required by the completion bond company,
and very probably by the camera operator, will be the shooting of a
frame leader. This involves looking through the viewﬁnder with the
camera at perfect right angles to a wall and with the lens focused on it.
Small coloured arrows made from camera tape are then stuck to the
wall pointing to the exact position of the corner of all the aspect ratios
the ﬁlm may be shown in.
Figure 17.1 shows how the frame leader should look on the wall.

Figure 17.1 A frame leader

viewﬁnder where the outer frame has an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, which
will represent the camera gate and, as this can be varied on most
35mm cameras, is known as the ‘hard mask’.The next set of markings
are only different in being slightly shorter in height and represent an
aspect ratio of 1.85:1. This is the aspect ratio used in most European
cinemas. Finally, the much squarer rectangle shows the portion of the
frame that will be used for a transfer to tape for television.
The purpose of shooting a frame leader is to reassure both the com-
pletion bond company and the camera operator that the aspect ratio
markings in the viewﬁnder correspond exactly to the negative aper-
ture of the camera gate. This is best done by viewing the negative.
Some operators will ask for a length of frame leader to be sent to the
laboratory in order that a short length is printed before each day’s
rushes or dailies.
The frame leader must be clearly marked with the production
name, the date and the camera identiﬁcation. This way, there can be 
no confusion as to which camera and viewﬁnder markings it refers to.
This is not just essential when there are several camera bodies on the
shoot, for it is surprising how often one laboratory will have several
tests going through the bath on any given night. This also applies to
hire houses who may have several productions testing at once.
This test is not ideally viewed on a projector, but with a low-
powered microscope. As I have said, most projectors do not show the
full camera aperture unless they are at the laboratory or hire house,
where an oversize gate can often be found; even so, microscopic investi-
gation will often be more critical than projection.
There is a further use to which the frame leader can be put. If the
rushes are being transferred to tape,it is not uncommon for the rushed
telecine to slightly underscan the picture.This produces a tighter com-
position than the operator originally framed for. If this is suspected,
then a length of frame leader can be sent through with the next batch
of rushes and all will be revealed. This needs doing disappointingly
often. Just as when rushes are to be provided as a ﬁlm print, some
operators will ask for a length of frame leader to be sent to the trans-
fer house making the tape copies in order that a short length is trans-
ferred before each day’s rushes. This usually overcomes the problem
of the telecine underscanning.
Scratch tests
Every camera magazine must be tested for scratching.This is done by
running 20 feet or so of ﬁlm through the camera using each and every
magazine. This simultaneously scratch tests the camera bodies. The
ﬁlm need not be sent to the laboratory – simply unwind the last three
or four feet of ﬁlm from the take-up side of the magazine and inspect
both sides of the ﬁlm through a strong magnifying glass.
A trick many loaders use is to ‘catch the light’ on the ﬁlm when
looking for scratches. When this is done the surface of the ﬁlm will
shine and any scratches will show up as black lines.
If the ﬁlm shows short scratches identical on every frame, then as
likely as not either this has occurred in the camera gate or the loop of
ﬁlm just before or just after the gate has been too big and has rubbed
on the camera body at the moment the loop has been at its largest.
Testing
149

If a scratch shows as a continuous line, then there is probably some-
thing stuck in the light trap of the magazine or possibly one of the lay-
on rollers in the magazine is not rotating freely. If the magazine
employs felt rollers as part of the light trap, they may need cleaning.
If you are in any doubt as to where the scratching is occurring, run a
second test and before you remove the ﬁlm from the camera take 
the lens out and mark the frame in the gate. Now, when you unload 
the ﬁlm you can count the number of frames before or after the gate
to the point where the scratch starts. If you now mark this point and
reload the camera again with the original marked frame in the gate,
your new mark will be exactly where the scratching is occurring.
You will need to check with the completion bond company as to
whether they wish to hold a developed copy of your scratch tests. If
they do, only shoot them after you are conﬁdent your eyeball tests are
absolutely free of scratches and do not run the negative you will be
sending them through a projector, where further scratching may
occur. Simply run an eyeball test on the processed negative to reassure
yourself all is well.
Fog tests
These are rarely carried out unless you are going to a very hot and
sunny country. Point the camera at a wall and write on the wall the
magazine number, then underexpose this by at least one stop to give a
dark grey image on which to look for fogging. Get a strong lamp and
run 20 feet of stock through each magazine while hand-holding the
lamp and pointing its beam at all the joins between the magazine door
and its casing, then do the same for the camera door. On project-
ing the print you will quickly see whether any light is getting through
the seals.
With a fog test it is useful to light the room and the magazine num-
ber on the wall with a different coloured light than is hand-held
around the camera and magazine. So if the room and wall are lit by
tungsten light, use an HMI daylight lamp for the test. Conversely,
if the room and wall are lit with daylight, use a tungsten lamp for the
test.This way even the slightest light leakage can be detected as it will
show up as a different colour to the image on the screen.
Lens testing
All the lenses should have been collimated by the hire house before
delivery to you for testing. Should your DP be supplying some or all of
the lenses, then most hire houses will check their collimation free of
charge. Any faults found should be put right before your testing
period starts.
The lens tests that must be carried out are:
●
Inﬁnity test
●
Resolution test
●
Focus tests at various distances.
In addition, as many focus pullers do not trust the engraved scale on
some lenses, they insist on marking up critical focus points on plastic
tape applied around the lens barrel.They will also mark up individual
150
Practical Cinematography

focus rings if they are using something like the Arri follow-focus
device. If this is to be done, then both left-hand and right-hand rings
need to be prepared.
Inﬁnity test
It is important that all your lenses can focus as far as inﬁnity. To test
this can be taxing as, other than with the iris wide open, there will be
sufﬁcient depth of ﬁeld for almost any lens to show inﬁnity as sharp.
There is a difference of opinion on this test. Some focus pullers insist
on shooting this test, while others feel it is sufﬁcient to eye-test the
lenses. My feeling is that an eye test is probably adequate. If you
decide to shoot a test then you have two options. If the camera you are
using has a variable shutter, then you can close this down to obtain the
correct exposure with the lens wide open. If the camera does not have
a variable shutter, then you will have to shoot at dusk or dawn.
You must not, under any circumstances, put neutral density ﬁlters in
front of the lens for this test. Putting glass ﬁlters in front of a lens will
alter the point at which the lens focuses on inﬁnity.This is particularly
noticeable with lenses of long focal length. Indeed, it is essential that
all the longer lenses are inﬁnity tested with and without a Wratten 85
ﬁlter to check they can reach inﬁnity in both conditions. If the DP you
are working with tends to use a lot of ﬁlters, then test the longer lenses
with several ﬁlters on.
You will notice that with most long-focus lenses the focus barrel will
go past inﬁnity. This is to ensure that you can reach inﬁnity with sev-
eral ﬁlters in front of the lens, as the effect on inﬁnity when adding
extra glass to the front of the lens is greater the longer the focal length
of the lens.
Resolution test
There are a number of wall charts available for lens testing and most
of them employ a series of parallel white lines on a black surface.The
lines are so arranged in blocks of ﬁner and ﬁner lines in order to dis-
cover how ﬁne the line must be before the lines cannot be seen apart.
This is the limit of the lens’s resolution. These measurements only
work if the chart exactly ﬁlls the frame.A good example of such a lens
test chart,designed and produced by KJM Consultants for Panavision,
can be seen in Figure 17.2. Do not copy and use this illustration from
the book – if reproduced in this way it will not have sufﬁciently ﬁne
deﬁnition to give any meaningful results.
These days it is more common to test the ﬁnite resolution of a lens
on the bench either by measuring its MTF (modular transfer function)
or by projecting a very accurate chart, similar in appearance to that
described above, through the lens onto a wall where, due to the large
size of the projected image, the judgement of which are the ﬁnest lines
resolved can more easily be made.
The testing of the ultimate resolving power of a lens is best done in
conjunction with the specialist at your hire house. If you have worked
with the hire house before and trust them, then you can, quite reason-
ably, ask them to have checked all the lenses before you start your
testing.

Focus tests at various distances
Focus testing is time-consuming and must be done with great care. It
usually involves covering a wall of the test room with lens test charts,
such as that shown in Figure 17.2.This is so that the entire frame can be
ﬁlled with charts.An alternative, but more time-consuming, method is
to relocate a chart at the top and bottom edges of the frame, both sides
and all four corners. This is in addition to keeping one at the centre.
Mercifully, most hire houses have a wall of charts, or something similar,
already set up, but moving charts around is cheaper if you are having
to test independently.
As previously stated, a lens test chart can only be used for measure-
ment of resolution when it exactly ﬁlls the frame. With focus testing,
we are not looking for a measurement but are checking if the lens
focuses at the distance indicated on the lens barrel or, if it doesn’t,
making a new mark at that focus ourselves; secondly, we are checking
if the lens maintains the focus at the edges of the frame when it has
been focused at the middle of the frame.
For focus testing you are only using lens test charts as very easily
readable images from which to tell if the lens is focusing properly.
Each focus puller will have a preferred set of distances at which they
like to test and mark up the lenses. They may not always use the same
ones. For example, if you are about to shoot an intimate script, and are
on location,then the nearer focus points are more important,since that
is where your cast are going to be most of the time. On the other hand,
if you are going to shoot a western, you are going to spend some of the
time shooting close-ups but a lot of the shoot will be nearer inﬁnity.
Many focus pullers simply abandon the distances engraved on the
lens and mark up their own with thin tape and a ﬁne, waterproof
marker pen.
The technique is to set up the camera exactly at right angles to the
wall of test images and perfectly central to them. Every lens must then
be checked, through the viewﬁnder, at every distance the focus puller
requires.This does take a long time, but can save much grief on the set
during shooting. Some ﬁlm must be exposed with each lens at each
Figure 17.2 A lens test chart

position. Ideally, two exposures should be made, one at the maximum
aperture of the individual lens and another at a stop the DP nominates
as one they will be using a lot.
Do make sure that the lens ﬂange to ﬁlm plane depth and the lens
ﬂange to viewing screen distance have been checked to the highest
possible standards available by the camera supplier before you carry
out the focus tests, otherwise you are wasting your time.
Gamma testing
The last test that requires ﬁlm to be sent to the laboratory is the
gamma test.This requires you to remove 30–50 feet of ﬁlm from a roll
of every type and batch of ﬁlm you will be using during production.
When asked to carry out a gamma test the laboratory will make an
exposure on each sample using a sensitometer: they will process the
ﬁlm and, using a densitometer, will read off the sensitometric curve for
all three colour layers of the negative.They will send back the test nega-
tives together with graphs of the sensitometric curves.
As reading these graphs takes experience and specialist knowledge,
it is quite reasonable to phone the laboratory and ask them if the tests
were satisfactory. If you wish to be doubly safe, ask them to fax the
production ofﬁce with their opinion.
What to do with the ﬁlm tests
Having successfully completed all the ﬁlm tests described above, they
should all be gathered together and carefully labelled. Most usually
they will then be lodged with the cutting room, assuming the editor
has started at the beginning of shooting. Occasionally, they may be
sent to the production ofﬁce or the completion bond company. Ask
the production ofﬁce which they prefer.
Non-ﬁlm testing
There are a number of non-ﬁlm tests that it is prudent to carry out:
●
Batteries
●
Tripods
●
Heads.
Batteries
It is sensible to fully charge all your batteries as soon as possible and
leave them untouched during your testing days.Check them at the end
of your testing period – they should all have held a full charge over
several days; any that have not should be changed.
Tripods
This may be done by the dolly grip, but all the tripod legs should be
tested to make sure they are in good condition and that they lock
Testing
153

properly. This may seem obvious, but on a recent shoot a tripod leg
gave way and deposited a quarter of a million pounds worth of camera
and lens assembly rather dramatically on the studio ﬂoor – an embar-
rassment one would wish to prevent at all cost.
Heads
Every tripod head should be checked. Geared heads need skilled
adjustment and many operators will want to check them themselves.
Some operators provide their own heads. If this is the case, then it 
can safely be assumed that they will bring them to the set in perfect
condition.
Fluid heads should be checked for smooth movement over the
whole of their range and on every friction setting. It is also wise to set
them up on the ﬁrst day of testing and just leave them standing to
check for any ﬂuid leaks.
Remote heads can be a problem as they often arrive with a crane on
the day they are going to be used and therefore you have no chance to
test them. Fortunately, the crane and head should come with a skilled,
specialist operator and all will be well. If you are having a remote head
from the start of production, make sure whoever is going to operate it
is happy with its performance.
Stores, supplies and expendables
Ordering expendable stores before starting production can be a
touchy business – great care should be exercised. Some production
ofﬁces are unaware of the quantity of consumables that will be used
on a large production. Some have, sadly, been persuaded to purchase
far more than could possibly have been needed and know full well
that the over-ordering was used to stock personal supplies.As you are
going to be working with the production ofﬁce for the duration of the
shoot, it is as well to get off to a good working relationship.Therefore,
order your stores, supplies and expendables with care.
On a long production it is wise to order only the amount of stores
etc. you will need to get halfway through the schedule. You can make
this clear to the production ofﬁce, thus making them aware that you
will only reorder as needs be. My crews have, in the past, found this a
good and reliable strategy.
Many hire houses have in-house shops or store rooms and are only
too happy to supply most of your needs on site. They are often good
value but do check, as overcharging annoys the ofﬁce as much as 
over-ordering.
Your report sheet books and can labels should be obtained from the
laboratory you intend to use. As the layout will be familiar to them,
this reduces the possibility of any misunderstanding. The laboratory
can, as often as not, supply you with spare ﬁlm tins. Extra ﬁlm bags
should be purchased new – only the bag the ﬁlm came in from the
manufacturer should ever have a roll of rushes put back into it. Never
use a bag that has previously been used by someone else – you have no
idea what dirt and dust it may contain. Film cores can also usually be
obtained from the laboratory; if not, then try the stock supplier or
your hire house.

I know a loader who has designed a report sheet blank on his laptop
computer. During the day he ﬁlls in the sheet as he goes along and
prints it out at the end of the day.This is very impressive, but does lack
the familiarity aspect of the laboratory’s own report sheet. Perhaps if
this appeals to you a good idea may be to send a blank copy to the labora-
tory contact for approval.They will probably be quite happy with this
and it will overcome the familiarity problem, as well as starting a good
working relationship with the laboratory.
If you use computers for any purpose when ﬁlming, always back
your work up regularly and keep the backup in a separate place from
the computer. Computers are replaceable and should be insured, but
the greatest value is often the information they contain and this can be
irreplaceable. If you are going to have your computer with you on a
regular basis, it might be a good idea to ask the production ofﬁce to
add it to the company’s insurance list.
The all-important 18 per cent grey cards can be obtained from the
laboratory, Kodak or several independent suppliers. I get mine directly
from Kodak,put my message on them as I have described and bring my
own to the set. My regular loaders now order them for me and present
them to me on the ﬁrst day of shooting already labelled. Whatever
cards you order, check with the DP ﬁrst to ﬁnd out their preference.
The current trend for clapperboards is to use what have become
known as ‘backlight boards’; the layout of a typical backlight board is
shown in Figure 17.3.These have the clap sticks still made out of wood,
but the board is made from white, translucent Perspex or Plexiglas.
The idea is that they should be just as effective when lit from the front
as from the back, which indeed they are. Temporary marks on the
board, such as slate numbers, are made with a dry marker pen and can
therefore be easily rubbed off. I very much favour them, as anything
that makes the board easier for the cutting room to read must be a
good thing.

If the production is sufﬁciently well funded and is to shoot for a rea-
sonable time, then it is worth having the backlight board engraved
with all the permanent information. If not, put waterproof adhesive
tape on the board ﬁrst, mark the information with a waterproof
marker and then cover with a further layer of waterproof tape. This
makes for an easily readable board, the backlight idea still works and
the whole lot can be peeled off at the end of the production.
One thing I do not approve of, and most of the backlight boards suf-
fer from it, is the marking of the lines on the clap sticks with the upper
and lower lines going in the same direction. They should go in the
opposite directions, as in a chevron, as this makes it much easier for
whoever is synching up the rushes to see the exact moment the two
sticks come together.
The camera car
Calling it a camera car is a hangover from the past as nowadays it is, as
often as not, a three-ton truck! Ideally, the sides of the truck should
have shelving with a large lip or bar at the front so that cases of equip-
ment can travel in complete safety.A bench is essential for assembling
the camera.
Some trucks come with a small darkroom in one corner. This looks
to be a good idea but it is essential that the loader checks that the
darkroom is totally lightproof. This can be a time-consuming and
unpleasant exercise, as one only acquires full night vision after 20 min-
utes, and 20 minutes in a small, dark and airless room can be a taxing
affair even if you have taken your MP3 player with you.
Distrust of camera car darkrooms has led several loaders I know to
prefer a second bench on which they can leave their Harrison chan-
ging tent permanently set up. If a darkroom is still ﬁtted it usually
becomes a store for consumables so as not to waste space.
If you are ﬁlming in the height of summer or in hot climates, a small
fridge for the day’s ﬁlm stock is a good idea. Clearly, it will need plug-
ging in to a power supply, but a friendly word with the gaffer will usu-
ally ensure one awaits you on arrival at every location. It is surprising
how long a fridge will stay adequately cool when switched off provid-
ing the door is never opened. See Chapter 6 for guidance as to storing
ﬁlm stock at different temperatures.
Once the habit of supplying power to the camera car has been
established, a kettle and a coffee machine are a good idea, especially
on cold night shoots. Make sure the fridge has sufﬁcient space for all
the ﬁlm stock – in hot countries it is not uncommon for cans of coke
and beer to mysteriously ﬁnd their way into the fridge. Before letting
any drinks into the fridge, do check if you are on an alcohol-free pro-
duction; if you are, then be rigorous about not letting your fridge get
so contaminated, as I can envisage a situation where the loader in
charge of the fridge could get ﬁred when, unknown to them, some
friendly person has stocked up.
Offering refreshment to the lighting and grip crew usually ensures
adequate power supplies, though I must admit to being lucky in this
respect, as my regular lighting crew insist on taking over the coffee
and tea duties and have even presented me with a thermally insulated
mug with their nickname for me engraved on it – that’s service!

Composition and 
the rule of thirds
Framing using the rule of thirds
Perhaps the most used and useful rule of composition is the rule of
thirds. It is really very simple. If you imagine a frame with a line across
both the horizontal and the vertical positions, one-third of the frame
width in from each of the four edges of the frame, then any object
placed on this line will have added importance in the overall picture.
This division also produces nine identical boxes within the frame; later
we will explore the importance of this.
Figure 18.1 shows a 16  9 frame with all four of the third lines
shown.As you will appreciate, not only do the third lines have import-
ance, but the position where they cross each other becomes a position
of even greater importance within the overall frame as it acquires
stature from both the horizontal and the vertical third lines.
Let us explore how this might work in practice. If we were to photo-
graph a cityscape, say across a lake, we might choose to frame for the
skyline – this, after all, would be the obvious choice. If so, the shot
might look like Figure 18.2.
Figure 18.1 A frame divided into its
thirds
159
Figure 18.2 A horizon set on the
lower third

Here the horizon is set on the lower third and produces a very pleas-
ing composition, clearly at dusk.
Figure 18.3 is exactly the same view but now composed very ﬁrmly
with the horizon on the top third. Many things have changed as a
result of this compositional decision. Perhaps the most striking thing 
is that the scene now appears to be night. Simply by choosing to make
the reﬂection in the lake the dominant part of the scene we have sig-
niﬁcantly altered the audience’s opinion of the scene. In addition, we
have started to talk about very different matters with regard to the
script. For instance, Figure 18.2 might be about the ﬁnancial district of
the city, but Figure 18.3 could be about the demise of its ﬁshing ﬂeet.
To use the shots in the reverse context would be nonsensical. Such is
the power of the compositional choices.
Now let us bring in two more ideas – composing on the left and right
thirds and introducing movement into the frame.
In Figure 18.4 the dancers are in the middle of the frame – this is
usually a boring position, but the clear movement of the subjects can
make it very exciting. The effect of the shapes within the frame is so
160
Practical Cinematography
Figure 18.3 A horizon set on the
upper third
Figure 18.4 Central composition

powerful we can see the force of the movement even in the simple
graphic illustration. What do you think the audience would assume
would be the next event? I think they would expect the dancers to
twirl in the middle of frame. If this were to happen, then perhaps the
central composition would be appropriate, but what do we cut to? This
would, in fact, be an excellent end title shot.
Now let us look at Figure 18.5. Here the dancers’ bodies are
bisected by the left-hand third. There is a clear ‘dynamic’ input into
the frame. Although their bodies are bisected by the left-hand third,
the male partner’s left (camera right) hand and foot extend beyond
this portion of the frame.
There are now two inﬂuences on the frame – the balance of the
frame is clearly created by the mass of the dancers’ bodies, but there is
a dynamic push to the right made by the male’s extended limbs. So
what does the audience conclude from this? That the woman is about
to spin into the man’s arms and they will dance to the right of the
frame. Very much different to their conclusion from the composition
in Figure 18.4.
Now let us put exactly the same couple, in exactly the same pose,
in a composition where they are bisected by the right-hand third
(Figure 18.6). What would the audience conclude from this compos-
ition? Something very different from the previous compositions.
What? Well, the balance is different but the shot has only changed
by composing the couple on the right-hand third. What else? In the
original pose the woman’s right (camera left) hand had inﬂuence, but
not of great magnitude; the man’s left hand (camera right) had more
inﬂuence but still not very signiﬁcant.
In this composition the couple’s camera right limbs become all-
powerful in the dynamic of the frame. They actively and positively
push the right-hand edge of the frame away from themselves. The
audience’s conclusion as to what is about to happen is therefore that
they will now dance to the left, quite the reverse decision from when
the same action was composed on the opposite side.
At this point it is well to remember that there is very little in the frame
of a composition that doesn’t have some inﬂuence on the audience.
Composition and the rule of thirds
161
Figure 18.5 A composition set on
the left-hand third

Framing using the sixths
Just as in music, in composition we too have the equivalent of the
minor chords. In the world of cinematography these are the lines of
the sixths – that is, any line one-sixth of the way in from any edge of
the frame or one-sixth of the frame width out from the centre of the
frame. The sixths coming out from the centre of the frame are very
weak in terms of compositional power, but those coming in from the
outside edge do have an appreciable power. Their power is far less
than the power of the thirds, but nevertheless it is a very useful com-
positional tool.
In Figure 18.7 the skyline is contained within the bottom sixth of 
the frame. It makes a very pleasing composition, especially if in the
background there was, say, an attractive sunset. In fact, almost any
interesting object, on an important third or sixth, would, of course,
heighten the dramatic power of the composition. Leaving ﬁve-
sixths of the frame free causes this space to be very vulnerable in as
162
Practical Cinematography
Figure 18.6 A composition set on
the right-hand third
Figure 18.7 A composition set on
the lower sixth

much as almost anything placed in that area will have an inﬂuence 
on the audience greater than its normal value in a less dramatic 
composition.
In this vacant space even the Red Baron is a powerful force! In
Figure 18.8, by ﬂying his aeroplane on the bottom line of the top left-
hand sixth box, even in caricature, he is such a powerful compositional
force that one’s eye is totally distracted from the lovely skyline that
previously dominated the frame. Such is the power of the sixths.
Diagonal framing
There are other elements within the frame that can have a very strong
effect on the audience’s response to the overall picture. Perhaps the
next most powerful dynamic force within the frame is the diagonal
line – that is, the line ﬂowing directly from one corner of the frame to
the diagonally opposite corner.
In Figure 18.9 there is a very simple composition of a cat looking 
at its master working at a painting. Study this composition. What is 
the cat looking at? There is little doubt,it’s looking at the back of its mas-
ter’s head. Not at the painting. Not at the brush and not at the palette.
But how can we be so certain that that is the cat’s actual point of view?
Quite simply, the cat’s eye-sockets are bisected by the bottom right
to top left diagonal of the frame, as is the back of the painter’s head. I
have deliberately left out the eyes of both the cat and the painter to
prove the point. Figure 18.10 is identical to Figure 18.9 but with the
diagonal line inserted to show the path of its inﬂuence.
Complex and combined composition
It is also possible to compose individual elements of the overall picture
within the separate nine boxes formed by the division of the frame by
the lines of the thirds.

‘weight’ on a composition

Composition and the rule of thirds
165
Another variation is to combine different compositions within dif-
ferent elements of a single frame. Let us say that we are going to put a
‘heavy’ object within the right-hand vertical three boxes and a small,
perhaps fragile, object in the bottom left-hand third box. If the subject
looming in the right-hand third could be made to have an eyeline to
the subject in the lower left-hand box, we would have a very effective
composition.
Figure 18.11 is such a composition. The bear on the right is 
wholly composed within the right-hand third, while the butterﬂy is
beautifully contained and composed within the lower left-hand third
box. Here, combining at least two rules has given us an unusual and
very effective composition. There are many, many variations on this,
and other, themes.

Lenses and perspective
Frame size and focal length
Figure 19.1 represents a general view of a city scene. Marked on it are
the framings for a wide-angle lens, a medium-angle lens and a medium
close lens. As you can see, the different lenses only select different
amounts of the scene.There is no change in perspective – none of the
ﬁgures or items in the shot change their relationship to each other.
In Figure 19.2 you can see four more lens sizes – again there is no
relational change between the elements of the scene in the different
framings, even though the frame size has now changed radically.
In Figure 19.3 the framings for even more extreme long focal
lengths are illustrated and again the relationships haven’t changed.

If you were ﬁlming in Super 16, the widest framing in Figure 19.1
would perhaps be taken on a 9.5mm lens and the tightest framing in
Figure 19.3 would be at least a 500mm lens.
What has happened is we have simply selected smaller and smaller
segments of the original scene. Now, for the storytelling purposes of
the ﬁlm this might be just what we want, going closer and closer until
we isolate the girl either within the middle of the scene, or even from
the scene, thus concentrating the audience on that one person.
Perspective
Whereas in Figures 19.1–19.3 the camera was a very long way away
from the subject and all the elements of the scene were relatively close

together, in Figure 19.4 there are three main elements in the scene and
they are at very different distances from the camera.
The woman is quite close to the camera, indeed even in what is a
wide shot of the background she is in a mid-shot.The car is in the mid-
dle distance and the houses are making the background. We can esti-
mate that if the houses are 100 per cent of the scene depth away from
the camera then the car is 60 per cent of the distance and the woman
is perhaps 25 per cent.
This is quite different from Figures 19.1–19.3,where all the objects are
within the range of 90–100 per cent of the camera to subject distance. So
how do the elements of the scene behave as we use different lenses?
In Figure 19.5, where a middle-length lens has been used, the elem-
ents have grown in a slightly different ratio.This ratio is in proportion
to their distance from the camera. The woman has grown in size con-
siderably, the car a little and the houses only slightly.
In Figure 19.6, where an even longer lens would have been used, the
woman has again grown,the car has disappeared completely and there
is very little left of the houses.
How would this affect our reading of the script in each of these
shots? In the wide shot (Figure 19.4), there is a very deﬁnite placing 
of the woman in an environment and the car is clearly a part of the
action. In the medium close-up (Figure 19.5), the car might as well not
be there and the woman is dominating the frame, but we are still
aware of the environment (that is, the houses).
In Figure 19.6 the woman totally dominates the frame, the car is not
present at all and the houses are having much less inﬂuence on what
the picture, as a whole, is having on the audience.
So we can see that, without moving the camera, we can not only
change the audience’s attention by simply selecting the angle of view,
but we can dramatically affect the audience’s reaction to different elem-
ents of the scene by setting those elements at different distances from
the camera before we select the area to be photographed.
In the sequence of Figures 19.4–19.6 we have not moved the 
camera – it stayed still and we changed lenses. In the sequence 
Figures 19.7–19.9 the lens remains the same but we move the camera
to reframe on the woman.
In Figure 19.8 you can see what has happened.The three elements –
the car, the houses and the woman – now look very different. The car
is still playing in the story and we see far more of the houses, thus
telling the audience a very different story. But the woman now dom-
inates the frame.
What is the difference? In Figure 19.7 the three subjects stayed in the
same relationship but in Figure 19.8 they have changed their relation-
ship.The houses have moved from 100 per cent of the original distance
to 95 per cent.The car has moved from originally 60 per cent to 52 per
cent and the woman from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. So proportionally
the woman has changed her relative distance from the camera more
than the car and far more than the houses. Thus, the proportion of the
frame that they occupy has changed in the same relationship.
This produces a very different reading of the overall picture by the
audience. Both the car and the houses are still very much part of the
scene.
If we now move the camera closer still and reframe to obtain the ear-
lier close-up of the woman, the proportional relationship changes again.

The houses are 90 per cent of the original distance, the car, say, 40 per
cent and the woman now,say,5 per cent of the scene depth in Figure 19.7.
What has happened? By comparison with the earlier close-up,
things are very different. Again, we have a proportional change and
again both the car and the houses are still in the story, so we are still
discussing these elements of the scene with the audience.
One unfortunate thing has occurred, though. Carefully compare the
close-ups in Figures 19.6 and 19.9. You will notice that the woman’s
face has become wider and a little distorted. This is a very common
effect when taking a close-up on a wide-angle lens and should be
guarded against.It must be handled very carefully and,if possible,should
not be allowed to happen to the extent that a lay audience will ever
notice it.Your actors and your producer, who has in all probability paid
them large sums, will not thank you if you photograph them in this way.
But how has this distortion come about? It is simple – we have
brought the camera so near that the proportional differences we dis-
cussed earlier now affect the contours of the face.At this distance, the
camera is so close that the tip of the woman’s nose is probably some
70 per cent of the distance to her ear lobes, so the proportional differ-
ence in size that affected the car and the houses is now sufﬁciently
great as to affect the shape of her face.
Any lens wider than that considered normal for the format you are
using should be avoided for a close-up. In fact, if at all possible, no
close-up should ever be made on a lens less than twice the focal length
of a normal lens.
So we see that we can never choose a lens for just its angle of view –
the perspective that goes with that choice must always be considered.
Focal length and emotional involvement
Camera placement
It is important to remember that where you place your camera or,
more exactly, where you place the nodal point of your taking lens is
where you place your audience.
Think of it this way: the human eye is roughly spherical and when
looking left or right, up or down, is rotating about the centre of that
sphere as the eyeball swivels in the eye socket.With a camera lens, the
optical centre of the lens, its nodal point, is the point where if you
swivel the lens and camera about this point the image will appear to
neither track left or right nor move up or down. Gears, and a few ﬂuid
heads, are constructed so that the pan and tilt movements can both
rotate about the nodal point of the lens.When this is done the camera
movements will be as close to the way a human eye rotates in its
socket and therefore feel the most natural.
Extending this argument, it becomes clear that if we wish to either
involve the audience in the action, or make it feel they are at a dis-
tance, where we ﬁguratively place the centre of their eye will make
them feel they are at that distance from the subject.
So choosing the camera position is very important, for it is also
choosing the emotional position of the audience; this position will
become the place they would physically expect to be observing from
were they present, in real life, at the action to be photographed.

Keeping the audience at arm’s length
If you look back at Figure 19.9, you can see an example of just how
bad things can get if you are not acutely aware of the fact that, with
your camera placement, you are transporting your audience.With very
few exceptions, one would never take a camera this close to an artist.
There is a common phrase of keeping something ‘at arm’s length’ and
this description has not come about by accident.We all have our phys-
ical space – that is, the actual area around our person that we would
feel threatened if another person were to come inside it. For most of
us it extends around us by an arm’s length. If someone comes nearer
to us than the stretch of our arm, we are going to feel threatened.
In Figure 19.9 the nodal point of the lens, and therefore your audi-
ence, must be around two feet or 50 centimetres from the woman’s
face. We have taken our audience within her physical space and are
therefore asking either another protagonist in the script we are photo-
graphing that the camera is now playing or the audience itself to
threaten the artist – something that should only be done intentionally,
and rarely, and only when the script demands it.
Subjective and objective shots
Camera placement and the perspective created by your choice of focal
length can seriously affect how the audience feels about their rela-
tionship with the scene. Figure 19.10 has been taken on a very-wide-
angle lens; the impression this gives the audience is that they, or at
least the person the camera is playing, are almost about to jump over
the wall.They are highly involved with the action or positioning of the
camera and the perspective conveys the idea of a dynamic movement
into the garden and towards the house. This effect is described as 
172
Practical Cinematography
Figure 19.10 A wide-angle

Lenses and perspective
173
Figure 19.11 A less extreme
wide angle
creating a subjective shot – that is, the camera, and therefore the 
audience, has become part of the subject, since their point of view is
almost within the composition and the perspective is telling them the
same thing.
If we now move on to Figure 19.11, things have changed somewhat.
We are still using a wide-angle lens, but one having nothing like so
extreme a wide-angle perspective. The shot width is roughly similar
but the emotional positioning of the audience has changed. Although
we can see roughly the same amount of information,the audience now
has a feeling that, although they would clearly be seen from the house,
they are not quite intruding on the privacy of its occupants. This is
because the drawing power of the lens in use, which creates the per-
spective, has changed and this, together with the camera moving away
from the house to get as wide a shot, has forced inclusion of the outer
wall to the property; this has heightened both the physical, and more
importantly, the emotional distancing, separating the audience from
the scene.
Again, in Figure 19.12 we are maintaining roughly the same width
of shot as far as the house is concerned, but have had to move further
away again to achieve this. We now feel almost as if we are on a path,
which indeed we are, and while we can see clearly into the garden we
feel little emotional involvement with its occupants or anything that
may be happening within.This is because we now have a perfectly nor-
mal perspective taken, not surprisingly, by what might be considered
the normal focal length for a camera of this type. We have not forced
either a subjective or an objective positioning of our audience. The
relationship between subject and viewer is completely relaxed.
In Figure 19.13 we have moved back a little further while still trying
to maintain the same width of shot. The effect is only subtly different
from Figure 19.12, but can be important. By occluding the view of the

174
Practical Cinematography
terrace we have, in a certain way, made it more interesting, a little
more mysterious.
If we go back further still, and attempt to maintain the size of the
house in the frame, on this location we are forced to include some
branches in the foreground, thus giving the impression that the camera
is almost a ‘peeping Tom’ and is observing the house very much without
the occupant’s permission, as in Figure 19.14. We have now reached
the focal length and therefore the perspective that makes this very

much an objective or observational shot, very deﬁnitely not a subjec-
tive one.
Now let us consider what might happen if we take the camera still
further away and put on a still longer focal length lens. Figure 19.15 is
just this and now, simply by changing camera position and focal length
of the lens, we are truly emotionally observational in our relationship
with the house and its occupants.This is observational in the extreme,
almost a surveillance shot.

What is a ‘normal’ focal length lens?
In all that has gone before in this chapter, we have been discussing the
many and different effects on the image, perspective and emotions of
our audience of our decision to choose a lens of one focal length or
another. But is it possible to decide what is a ‘normal’ lens for any
given format? It is very simple – the focal length of a ‘normal’ lens will
be the same as the dimension on the diagonal of the frame format
being used.
Therefore, for a standard Academy 35mm frame the dimensions
are as shown in Figure 19.16, though in this instance all the dimensions
are speciﬁed in imperial measurements, i.e. inches.The diagonal comes
out at 1.073in. or as near as makes no difference a 25mm lens.

Aspect ratios
The 35 mm frame
From the various originators of the motion picture camera came nearly
as many ideas as to how a piece of movie ﬁlm should be laid out, what
the picture size should be and what type, if any, of perforations should
be deployed. In 1907, an international agreement was reached stating
that the ﬁlm should be 35mm wide, have a picture size of 0.980in. 
0.735in. and should have four perforations to each frame on both
sides of the frame. This format is now referred to as a full aperture or
as using an open gate. It is sometimes also referred to as the ‘Silent’
aperture.The layout of this format is shown in Figure 20.1.
It can only be imagined as to what negotiations were fought over to
come to an agreement where the dimension of the frame was in inches
(which both Britain and America use), the width of the ﬁlm was meas-
ured in millimetres (a continental concept) and all the parameters of the
perforation were totally American. Nevertheless, the standard was so
perfect we are still using it as the main plank of our technology today.
With the coming of the sound on ﬁlm, space had to be found for the
optical soundtrack.The Society of Motion Picture Engineers of America
standardized the required layout as one keeping the same relationship
between the height and the width of the picture,but reducing the area by
24 per cent.As one side of the frame was to remain in the same place,this
would leave room on the other side for the new soundtrack, as shown
in Figure 20.2.This new picture size and placement is still known as the
‘Academy’ aperture and was formally standardized in February 1932.
As you can see in Figure 20.2, this had the added effect of widening
the spaces between the frames. This was wasteful, but did come with
one advantage – any need for mechanical joins could now be carried
out within this new area and, for the ﬁrst time, would not show to the
audience.
The aspect ratio
Many different screen shapes have evolved since the adoption of the
Academy frame in 1932, but most have remained within the 35mm
four-perforation pull-down format. In order to readily describe these
differing frames, we refer to them by their aspect ratio.The aspect ratio

is simply the mathematical relationship between the height and the
width of the screen.It is always expressed with the height as 1.Therefore,
if we divide the height of an Academy screen into its width and express
the result in decimals we get 1.33, the width being 1.33 times the
height.To be correct, an aspect ratio should always be shown with the
1 present and a ratio sign between it and the decimal, so an Academy
frame becomes 1.33:1, which is said as ‘one point three three to one’.
The joy of using an aspect ratio is that it matters not whether one is
referring to a screen ratio or the aperture in the camera gate, the same
ﬁgures will apply – so if a projectionist receives a tin marked as 1.33:1
they will know exactly how to present the ﬁlm and in what format it is
intended to be shown.
Widescreen
The majority of feature ﬁlms are currently shot in what is casually
referred to as widescreen. This leads to some confusion as there are
two, very similar, widescreen formats in use. In the USA, it is common
to shoot widescreen in an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, while in mainland
Europe 1.66:1 is more common.In Britain there is,most often,a typically
British compromise. This entails using a 1.66:1 hard mask, the actual
aperture cut into the camera gate, and marking up the viewﬁnder for
both 1.66:1, the outer frame, and 1.85:1, which will be shown as two
parallel lines just inside the top and bottom of the 1.66:1 markings.As
so many features are pre-sold to television this is good practice, as
slightly more emulsion area can be shown on television than could be
cut from the 1.85:1 ratio.This is done by taking the television transfer,
in 4  3 format, from the 1.66:1 master.A viewﬁnder showing all these
requirements would appear as in Figure 20.3.
This would translate to a camera negative layout as shown in Figure
20.4, where the outer rectangle is the 1.66:1 frame and the inner rect-
angle is the 1.85:1 frame.The frame bar between the individual frames
has now grown even thicker. This wastage led to experiments with
three-perforation pull-down, as discussed in the following section.
The area of emulsion now used by a 1.85:1 widescreen negative com-
pared with the original full, or Silent, aperture is just 56 per cent of the
original, as shown in Figure 20.5. It says a lot for the developments in
emulsion technology that, despite using an image area of just a little
over half the original,we think of today’s screen images as being superb.
Three-perforation pull-down
Some years ago, several manufacturers introduced 35mm cameras
either made for, or adaptable to, a three-perforation pull-down as
against the traditional four.This was because it had been noted that a
1.85:1 negative picture could be accommodated in the height of three
perforations if a hairline frame bar was accepted. The layout of the
three-perforation format is shown in Figure 20.6.The purpose of intro-
ducing this was simply to reduce the cost of producing the master nega-
tive by 25 per cent.
Despite this being a very sound idea, which the camera manufactur-
ers could easily go along with, editing equipment manufacturers were

less keen to rebuild their machines and the distributors, who run the
cinemas, showed no interest at all in re-equipping the cinemas as this
cost would far outweigh the saving in the cost of the print stock. As 
a result, any print struck from a three-perforation negative had to 
be optically printed up to a four-perforation print and the cost of 
this, compared to a straight contact print, outweighed the saving in
negative cost.
Perhaps, as Super 16mm had to wait, this too is an invention await-
ing its time.As non-linear editing has done away with many rush prints
in favour of a telecine transfer,and telecine machines can usually trans-
fer three-perforation footage quite easily, we may yet see renewed
interest in this format.
Three-perforation pull-down, some time later, became very popular
in the USA, where many multi-episodic television shows are now shot
on this format with specially constructed cameras utilizing 2000-foot
magazines to enable long takes of continuous action to be achieved.
On these shows, where by far the majority of the screen time is shot in
a studio with three or four cameras, very like a live television studio, a
print is never struck, for the camera negative goes straight to telecine
and is edited and transmitted from this format.
It is interesting to note that, when utilizing 2000-foot magazines, the
weight transfer caused by the ﬁlm moving from the front of the maga-
zine to the back is so great the tripod heads used are specially made
with a lead screw under the camera mounting plate and a small handle at
the back so that the operator can rebalance the camera during the shot.
In recent years, the introduction of digital intermediates (DI) – see
Chapter 9 – has renewed interest in three-perf pull-down, for with this
system the camera negative is scanned, just as for the TV shows, and
all post-production is carried out in the digital domain. At the end of
the post-production process, the images are simply played out via a
digital to photomechanical printer but on to a four-perf master negative.
Two-perforation pull-down
Two-perf pull-down was very popular at one time, mainly in Italy,
where Technicolor developed a system to enable ‘spaghetti westerns’
to be made on very low budgets. Some very well known ﬁlms were
made this way – For a Few Dollars More, etc. This frame layout is
shown in Figure 20.7.
The problem, at the time, was that ﬁlm stocks were nothing like as
sophisticated as they are today and despite utilizing the full width 
of the old Silent frame, right out to the perforations and with no space
for a soundtrack, the picture was never ideal. Although this was
exactly the right aspect ratio for blowing up to 35mm anamorphic
print, unfortunately the quality of the projected image was noticeably
inferior to one originated on a 35mm negative using anamorphic lenses.
The cost savings, though, were considerable, for while obtaining the
same size and aspect ratio on the screen, half the original camera 
negative was used and there was no need to hire expensive anamor-
phic lenses.
Just as with three-perf pull-down, two-perf is having something of 
a renaissance. Using modern ﬁlm stocks, high-quality modern lenses
and DI post-production,very good looking prints can now be obtained.

This might mean more ﬁrst time ﬁlm-makers, and even ﬁlm schools,
could afford to shoot for anamorphic projection – an exciting thought.
Anamorphic
In order to give First World War tank drivers a better view, a French
physicist, Henri Chretien, developed a lens system that was capable 
of expanding and compressing the horizontal angle of view. This
developed into a single Hypergonar lens capable of being ﬁtted to a
ﬁlm camera and a picture, Construire un Feu, was shot in France using
just this one lens. By the beginning of the 1950s,American ﬁlm-makers
had come to the conclusion that providing cinemas with wider and wider
screens was the answer to getting the audiences out of their houses and
away from their television sets. In order not to increase costs appre-
ciably, 20th Century Fox adopted and developed Chretien’s principles
to produce a range of lenses, of various focal lengths, capable of shoot-
ing a ﬁlm in a convenient way, on conventional 35mm ﬁlm stock but
with just a change of camera and cinema projector lenses.This resulted
in an aspect ratio of well in access of 2:1. This system they named
CinemaScope and it was very successful, being the ﬁrst worldwide
anamorphic process (anamorphos from the Greek ana  again,
morphos  to form).
The horizontal compression of the CinemaScope format was 2:1.
This gave CinemaScope an aspect ratio, when the 35mm camera frame
(0.868 in.  0.631in.) was expanded by the special lens, of 2.55:1.
Pressure from the cinema owners caused this to be reduced to a standard
of 2.35:1, mainly due to the architectural constraints of many existing
cinemas; this was often reduced still further on showing, for the same
reasons.
Figure 20.8 shows how the image is managed. The original scene is
horizontally compressed by a ratio of 2:1 by the taking lens. This is
then contact printed without any optical modiﬁcation.When the print
is shown in the cinema, the projector lens expands the image horizon-
tally by the same ratio of 2:1 and the image is restored on the screen in
the original height-to-width relationship.
In the early days of anamorphic photography, no compensation was
made in the camera viewﬁnder and the operator had to compose the
frame with the image compressed to half its actual width. Mercifully,
most modern cameras capable of accepting anamorphic lenses can
also be supplied with a de-anamorphosing viewﬁnder, so that the
operator can view the image as the audience will see it.That the early
operators could compose such wonderful images with a squeezed
image ﬁlls me with admiration.
65 mm and 70 mm
In compressing and expanding the camera image with the anamorphic
process, some horizontal deﬁnition is lost. To counteract this, several
companies decided to shoot very wide screen pictures without a 
compression lens but using wider ﬁlm. The Panavision company is
probably the best known of the exponents of this format. Todd-AO,
180
Practical Cinematography

a name conjured from Richard Todd and the American Optical
Company who made lenses for him,must be a close contender.In both
these systems a 65mm camera negative is employed using standard
35mm perforations but utilizing ﬁve-perforation pull-down. With all
the other layout dimensions remaining similar to 35mm and the image
going out to the perforations on both sides, no provision for sound is
made on the camera negative. This gives an image aspect ratio of
2.21:1.This aspect ratio is very close to CinemaScope’s, but by utilizing
a far larger image area gives considerably improved image quality. It
also enables simple, spherical (non-anamorphic) lenses to be used.
In order to deliver sound to the cinemas,the 65mm camera negative
is printed on to 70mm wide print stock. So that the image can still be
contact printed,both ﬁlms have their perforations,and images,in iden-
tical positions, the extra width coming as 2.5mm outside each row of
perforations.This extra 5mm of ﬁlm accommodates the various sound
and control tracks. Figure 20.9 shows the layout of both the 65mm
negative and the 70mm print.
There are hybrid systems where, for reasons of origination cost, the
anamorphic process is used to make a 35mm camera negative and this

is then optically expanded using a de-anamorphosing lens in the labora-
tory printer to produce a 70mm release print. It is quite common for a
ﬁlm shot on a 35mm anamorphic system to have a few release prints
made on 70mm for the premieres around the world and still make the
majority of general release prints as 35mm anamorphic prints.Clearly,
this makes for a considerable cost saving.
It is also possible to take the reverse route and shoot on a 65mm
negative, make the premiere prints on 70mm stock and still make the
general release prints as 35mm anamorphic prints, though the cost
savings using this route are nothing like as great.
Super 35
This much-vaunted format, where you get a larger than Academy
frame and can use existing spherical lenses, is effectively a return to
the old Silent layout. With modern ﬁlm stocks it is quite possible to
print a 2.21:1 section from the middle of the frame and send it to the
cinema either as a squeezed anamorphic print or enlarge it to 70mm.
The advantages in cost savings at the time of exposure are somewhat
offset by the cost of optical printing to the delivery format.
For the camera operator,Super 35 can be a nightmare.In Figure 20.10
you can see what ought to be a simple two-shot, here composed cor-
rectly for the inner frame, which is 2.21:1. If, as many a producer may
wish, another copy is struck for television, here shown by the larger
rectangle with curved corners, the composition becomes a nonsense.
The claim that you can shoot full frame and choose any aspect ratio
later, from a compositional point of view, is clearly erroneous.

Television
Television started life as a competition between two systems, that of
John Logie Baird, which had an upright or Portrait frame, and that
from the Marconi Company, which displayed a horizontal, or View,
frame. It was the Marconi system that was adopted with its horizontal
aspect ratio of roughly 1.25:1. In 1952, the BBC changed this aspect
ratio to 1.33:1 to conform with the then current cinema standard.
More recently, with the advent of digitally transmitted television, the
world is slowly going over to the latest standard, which is quoted as
16  9 (in cinema terms, 1.77:1). Although the 16  9 television for-
mat is closer to current widescreen cinema production, it does not
conform to any existing standard and is a compromise, albeit, perhaps,
a good one.
At some time or another, ﬁlms made in all the formats previously
discussed will come to be shown on television. Many will have been
composed with this in mind as they will have funding from a television
outlet built into the production budget. This may be all very well for
the producer but it can be a nightmare for the operator, who may have
to be thinking about several frame formats in the viewﬁnder all at the
same time.
For big budget pictures this presents less of a problem, as funding
should have been put aside for a pan and scan telecine transfer from a
master copy to the television format of choice. Pan and scan involves
a telecine operator moving a television-sized scanning area left and
right across the widescreen frame to obtain the best possible compos-
ition out of the original framing.This is clearly not ideal, but is far bet-
ter than just letting the television framing always be the centre section
of the original widescreen frame.
If the ﬁlm was originally shot in anamorphic, or 65mm, the televi-
sion frame section is likely to be a mere pastiche of the original con-
cept. Figure 20.11 shows the 4  3 television aspect ratio overlaid on
to a CinemaScope frame and Figure 20.12 shows the 16  9 ratio over-
laid on to a CinemaScope frame. Both these recompositions make
nonsense of the original framing. In Figure 20.11, the 4  3 version,
three of the original four members of the cast have disappeared. In
Figure 20.12, the 16  9 framing, the man on the left has managed to
reintroduce his ear but the other two still remain virtually unknown to
the television audience.
It is worth noting at this point that, while for over 60 years the ﬁlm
industry has referred to its aspect ratios as a ratio relative to unity,one,
Aspect ratios
183
Figure 20.11 CinemaScope
recomposed for 4  3 television

the television industry has always referred to its aspect ratios as the
nearest whole numbers representing height and width times each other.
Things are not quite as bad when taking a television scan from the
centre section of a widescreen negative that has been shot with a
1.66:1 hard mask in the camera gate but was framed for theatrical
release in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio.As we have seen, the television frame
can be taken from the 1.66:1 frame, thus gaining both height and, more
importantly, width of frame and getting nearer to the original compos-
ition. Figure 20.13 shows a 4  3 television frame overlaid on a 1.66:1
original, while Figure 20.14 shows the same but for a 16  9 television
transfer.

the television 16  9 aspect ratios

The technique of shooting a negative in the ratio of 1.66:1 and tak-
ing the television frame from this whilst still intending to show the
1.85:1 frame in the cinema relies on the operator using a technique
known as shoot and protect. This requires the camera operator to
shoot the primary composition for 1.85:1 while protecting the 1.66:1
frame. Protecting, in this instance, means being absolutely certain that
the 1.66:1 frame never shoots off the set, that microphones never
intrude into this frame and nothing that does not relate to the story
enters this,the outer,frame.The technique of shoot and protect is used
in many other cross-format situations and, providing not too many
formats are required, is not too arduous for the operator and can be
very successful.
When shooting Super 16mm for television, matters are a little com-
plicated as the world has still not gone over completely to the 16  9
television format; therefore, within the frame, allowances may have to
be made to accommodate a 16  9 composition, a 4  3 composition
and even an interim format of 14  9 as used on UK analogue 
transmissions at present.

Aspect ratios when
shooting for television
The nature of the problem
There has been a problem in recent years as to how to ‘future-proof’
television programmes that might be transmitted in the old 4  3 aspect
ratio but will, at some time, need to be repeated in the intermediate
14  9 aspect ratio or, eventually, in the 16  9 aspect ratio that has
become the new international standard.
The whole argument should really be turned on its head, as both
Super 16mm ﬁlm cameras and Digi Beta cameras happily shoot in an
aspect ratio either exactly, or very close to, the 16  9 aspect ratio.
Therefore, the true problem is ‘now-prooﬁng’. Most television pro-
grammes are almost all now originated in the 16  9 aspect ratio;
therefore, the difﬁcult decision is which compromise aspect ratio to
transmit now on the gradually disappearing 4  3 standard.
It is interesting to look at the history of the 16mm format, as this
shows how the Super 16mm standard,which was developed many years
ago,has found its true value in recent years as an ideal format for shoot-
ing high-quality television; this is particularly true in the UK.
History – the evolution of the Super 16 mm format
In the early 1920s George Eastman,the founder of Kodak,together with
the Bell & Howell company of Chicago, Illinois, set out to develop an
amateur ﬁlm standard, and a camera and projector to go with it. Bell &
Howell favoured a 17.5mm ﬁlm, this being the standard 35mm ﬁlm
simply slit in two. George Eastman objected strongly. He was adamant
that a completely new standard was required because, up until then,
the ﬁlm base was nitrate and was very prone to bursting into ﬂames.
He was determined that the amateur ﬁlm should only ever be avail-
able on the new ‘Safety’ ﬁlm base and to ensure this there had to be a
new standard. Eastman simply could not abide the idea of his new
product being responsible for burning down a customer’s home. Bell &
Howell were not entirely happy, as one of their major patents was
for the standard 35mm sprocket hole, which would have been used
again on 17.5mm, though now only on one side of the ﬁlm. George
Eastman prevailed though, very much to our current beneﬁt.
189

So Bell & Howell developed a new standard, a little narrower than
17.5mm, and with a new, smaller, sprocket hole. There was also to be
only two holes per frame, located either side of the ﬁlm at the inter-
section of the frames and 16mm wide, as shown in Figure 21.1 (35mm
has eight perforations per frame, four each side).
One of the design parameters of this development was that they had
decided that, for amateur use, an image size of around one-sixth of the
size of the silent 35mm frame would be adequate.
In 1926, sound ﬁlms came to the cinema. It wasn’t long after that the
now popular 16mm amateur format also wanted sound. It was to be
some time before the amateurs could record their own sound, but
before this there was a market for feature ﬁlms, cartoons, etc. to be
shown at home. By now, the quality of 16mm equipment, especially
projector mechanisms, was such that it was apparent that they could
give quite adequate image steadiness using only one row of perfor-
ations. In 1932, Bell & Howell introduced the Filmosound 120 projec-
tor, dispensing with the left-hand row of perforations and using this
area for an optical soundtrack.The new format layout is illustrated in
Figure 21.2. At this time the 16mm standard was very much ‘sub-
standard’ and, indeed, was often referred to by that name.
We now jump to the early 1960s, by which time 16mm was almost
semi-professional. In America much news ﬁlm was being shot on the
format, often using the Auricon camera or one of its derivatives. The
soundtrack, for this application, was now on a magnetic strip coated
down the left-hand edge where the optical track used to be.
Around the same time, the BBC in London was facing two prob-
lems. Firstly, they were about to open a second channel, BBC2, and
both channels were about to go into colour. This was going to put up
their ﬁlming costs considerably, for at that time drama was usually
shot in 35mm, though much of the factual output was then shot on
16mm. They therefore decided that they would see if 16mm could, at
least for British television, become a truly professional gauge and the
rest, as they say, is history.
The signiﬁcance of the BBC’s contribution to the development of
16mm into a professional gauge should not be overlooked. Arthur
Branson, and later Paul Bootle, put an enormous amount of energy and
BBC resources into the huge improvements in the image quality of the
16mm format.It is a wonderful synergy that as the BBC’s throughput of
16mm footage was so enormous, Kodak were prepared to fund consid-
erable research and development to improve emulsions and the quality
of the perforations, given that it was the founder of Kodak, George
Eastman, who pushed for the gauge at its inception.
The BBC also provided funding, development resources and
research for several of the then new self-blimped lightweight 16mm
cameras, as well as helping with the development of many of the high-
speed prime lenses – setting the trend for many years to come in both
16mm and 35mm cinematography. They were also instrumental in
developing and bringing to the market the new generation of rela-
tively high-speed, long-range zoom lenses, which we now take for
granted in 16mm cinematography.
In the early 1960s there was another development that was,perhaps,
to be just as signiﬁcant in the history of 16mm. Rune Erickson real-
ized that if the 16mm negative frame area was extended out to the
edge currently occupied by the soundtrack, the resultant picture’s
190
Practical Cinematography
Figure 21.1 The 1923 silent 16 mm
ﬁlm layout
Figure 21.2 The 1932 standard
16 mm layout with a soundtrack

aspect ratio would be very nearly the same as that used in most
European feature ﬁlms,i.e.1.85:1.He therefore had the aperture of his
Eclair NPR enlarged to very nearly the edge of the ﬁlm, increasing the
width of the frame by 2mm, and thus inventing Super 16. His purpose
was to reduce the negative cost of feature production in his native
Scandinavia where, with such a small audience in the indigenous lan-
guages, production costs were of paramount importance. Figure 21.3
shows the frame layout of Erickson’s new Super 16 format.
While his idea was practical, at the time there were some disadvan-
tages.The negative emulsions were not anything like as good as they are
today,the image was still far smaller than the 35mm equivalent and with
only one perforation per frame the mechanical stability of the gauge was
inferior to 35mm with its four perforations each side of every frame.
Despite the drawbacks, if treated with care, Super 16 was even then
capable of a very impressive quality. You could not put a soundtrack
on it since there was no space left, but this didn’t matter, for in post-
production the sound is always on a separate roll and for ﬁnal presen-
tation the negative was intended to be blown up to 35mm, where
there was room for the normal soundtrack.
Super 16 seemed to be a wonderful idea but it had not yet found its true
place in the industry.In retrospect,it was a fabulous idea awaiting its time.
16  9 television and Super 16
We are now seeing the introduction of domestic 16  9 televisions;
indeed, the majority in the shops, certainly in the UK, are now in this
format. It seems likely that, in Europe at least, the standard for the new
transmissions will be based on the current 625-line system but trans-
mitted on a terrestrial, or satellite, digital system. The 16  9 aspect
ratio is undoubtedly a compromise, but for Europe quite a good one.
In the UK, we still shoot virtually most of our ﬁctional television pro-
grammes on 16mm, so Super 16 ﬁts the 16  9 screen admirably. It is
important to realize that most European feature ﬁlms are shot on a
35mm spherical lens format with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, which again
is very close to the proposed 16  9 television format, so European
feature ﬁlms will look very good on 16  9 television.
Despite a rearguard action by the ASC (American Society of Cine-
matographers), who would prefer a 2:1 widescreen television aspect
ratio to conform with anamorphic production, which is the most com-
mon feature-ﬁlm format in America, albeit being originated in the
2.35:1 aspect ratio, it does seem very probable that 16  9 will become
a worldwide standard format,even if the transmission system varies from
country to country.If this is the case,then Super 16 is an ideal format as
its aspect ratio,as we have seen,is almost exactly the same.So,of course,
is spherical 35mm, which is more commonly used for US television.
At the moment, High Deﬁnition television seems too expensive for
general domestic use in Europe, though the ﬁrst station has recently
gone on air. It is gaining considerable popularity elsewhere, particu-
larly America and Japan.
The historical reasons for television coming into being with an aspect
ratio of 4  3 are twofold. Firstly, it was the then cinema ratio – i.e. the
Academy frame – devised by the Academy of Motion Picture Engineers
of America when they had to change the full-frame 35mm format to
Aspect ratios when shooting for television
191
Figure 21.3 The Super 16 mm layout

encompass a soundtrack. Secondly, when the Marconi electronic televi-
sion system was adopted it was only possible to ‘blow’ the glass cathode
ray tubes with the ﬂat end circular.Therefore,the ﬁrst,sensible,rectangle
that could be contained within this circle had an aspect ratio of 4  3.
Let us not delude ourselves. The current push to change the aspect
ratio of home televisions from the original worldwide standard of
4  3 (1.33:1) up to 16  9 (1.77:1) is predominantly to enable the
manufacturers to sell more televisions, the market having deemed to
be saturated with 4  3 colour televisions. So give them something
new to buy – widescreen! One can’t help remembering how, in the
1950s, the same approach was applied to cinema to try to counteract
the growth of television.
As a cinematographer, I am delighted – 16  9 is a much better
frame within which to compose and Super 16, in this format, gives
much improved image quality.
There are a number of matters that have to be taken on board,
though. The secret of successfully producing a Super 16 ﬁlm for televi-
sion has to be forward planning.There are many pitfalls in the use of this
gauge,though these can easily be overcome with foresight.For instance:
1
Not all the lenses we are used to using cover Super 16.
2
There is only one camera available that will run backwards.
3
At present there are no stunt cameras in Super 16, i.e. gun cameras.
4
Are you going to edit on a non-linear computer-based program
such as Avid or even Final Cut Pro? If not, do you have a Super 16
Steinbeck?
5
How are you going to deliver the product – 16  9 videotape or
4  3 videotape – and in what format?
6
Does your commissioning editor want both 4  3 and 16  9 
versions?
7
Do you need a projection copy for festival showing? If so, how do
you get a soundtrack on to it?
Note that,because of all the different delivery options,you must give the
laboratory much more information than on a Standard 16 production.
Framing in several formats
Perhaps the greatest problem for the camera department is not Super 16
equipment, or even Digi Beta or High Deﬁnition – there is plenty
available for most jobs – but how to compose the picture. It doesn’t
sound like a difﬁcult problem, does it? Well, here is one edict from a
major UK television station for a Super 16 project (I paraphrase a little):
The master negative shall be Super 16 clean of all extraneous objects
such as microphones and shall not shoot off the set. If you are making
a drama then, on analogue terrestrial television, you may transmit in
14  9 with a small letterbox but not 16  9. You will be able to trans-
mit in 16  9 only on a terrestrial digital station. You will also be
required to provide a full-screen 4  3 version for foreign sales.
Similar clauses are inserted in contracts for Digi Beta and HD 
productions.
192
Practical Cinematography

Let us take some examples to demonstrate the problem. In 
Figure 21.4 we have a well-composed 16  9 scene – the cloisters of a
university with two undergraduates shaking hands on the right-hand
side of the frame.
Over this I have shown a 16  9 or Super 16 frame. All is well at 
this point and we have a very nice composition with a good dynamic
composition.
If we now recompose the centre section, as is the norm, for 14  9,
we see – in Figure 21.5 – just what we would be transmitting. It really
is not acceptable. One undergraduate has nearly disappeared out of
the right-hand side of the frame and no one in their right mind would
have made an original composition in this way. I am sure, though,
there would be many non-production executives who would ﬁnd this
acceptable if only because the cost of pan and scanning the original to
correct the composition would, in their eyes, be prohibitive.

193

But now let us look at what the purchasers of the programme for
viewing abroad have to put up with. In Figure 21.6 I have shown the
same scene with the 4  3 centre section recomposed. One under-
graduate has now completely disappeared.
This really is a ridiculous situation. If we were to frame the original
for 4  3, then the 14  9 UK transmission will lose all the power of the
frame and in a 16  9 frame there will be no dynamic to the frame at all,
as the two undergraduates will now be very nearly in the middle of the
frame, a very boring composition. Do we really want to descend to this
level of artistry in the name of future-prooﬁng? Our real problem, at
least until 16  9 televisions take over completely, is ‘now-prooﬁng’.
Here I must make a plea to the production ofﬁce. Let us imagine
you have had your initial transmission and you are sitting back review-
ing your great success.A call comes from the foreign sales department
and you order a 4  3 copy. Seems simple, doesn’t it? Now without
further information your telecine operator is quite likely to assume
you mean the old 4  3 and put it up on a Standard 16 telecine. It’s not
his fault, and please don’t shout at him – you should have asked for
Centre Section Super 16 transfer to 4  3.
If you don’t,then the result will be as in Figure 21.7,since he will clip
off the left-hand side of the ﬁlm – the right-hand side of the screen –
and both undergraduates vanish!
Framing solutions
If you are lucky enough to be shooting for the UK Channel 4,then you
are very fortunate. They currently are quite happy to transmit drama
in true 16  9, even on their whole output – with the appropriate 
letterbox – and are heavily committed to the future of a European
16  9 format. In fact, they seem to be the only channel so totally com-
mitted on any analogue station in the UK.
When shooting for many stations across the world you have to deliver
in three formats. The current position in the UK seems to be that they
194
Practical Cinematography
Figure 21.6 A 4  3 section from
the middle of a 16  9 frame

assume ﬁction will be transmitted 14  9, but might be persuaded to
transmit 16  9. It is important to recognize the word ‘deliver’ – things
will change as the UK goes over to digital 16  9; only then will we be
allowed to truly realize the artistic potential of the 16  9 format.
The important thing, therefore, is to establish in what aspect ratio
your primary transmission will be and in what other aspect ratios you
must deliver, and come to an agreed compromise before you start
shooting. A change of mind later can be both unpleasant to look at
and very expensive.
My own position is that I would prefer to make the best compos-
ition for the primary transmission format – if this were 14  9, then
the composition would now look like Figure 21.8. But I would ask for
a budget to make a pan and scan transfer to any narrower format. I

also make every effort to ensure that I attend that transfer. Figure 21.9
shows how 16  9, 14  9 and 4  3 would look using this principle.
Therefore, if this composition were later transmitted on a full format
16  9 system, then it would look like the white outline in Figure 21.9.
Not fantastic, but very acceptable, for putting the undergraduates on
the edge of this frame, as in Figure 21.6, has more impact. The mid-
grey outline is the primary composition; 14  9 and the light grey out-
line would be the pan and scan 4  3 version, also very acceptable.
Without pan and scan the foreign sales version would look like
Figure 21.10 – which is still unacceptable.
On the other hand, let us assume that the producers have retained
sufﬁcient funds for a pan and scan transfer and have invited the cine-
matographer to supervise it. What a difference this would make. Any
foreign purchaser would not only be pleased with the framing of

Figure 21.11, but would never know it had been shot on any other for-
mat. Such is the power of forward planning.
Festival prints
Now let us consider the problem of showing your work at festivals,and
I am all for this – we all like to receive awards.
Most festivals can only show 16mm as a Standard ComOpt print,
i.e. Standard 16 with a combined optical track, as in Figure 21.12.
There are a very few festivals that can show a Super 16 print with its
SepMag, separate magnetic track, on a separate roll.
You have several options. You could make a centre section 4  3
print,but we have seen how this can ruin both the composition and the
pace of the editing – which means you are unlikely to win that award.
You could make a 35mm print, since all festivals can show them, and
it may increase your chances of winning, but it is very expensive. You
could show your work on videotape – on the other hand, that is prob-
ably a bad idea.
There is one very good option, though. This is to have the full 
Super 16 frame reduction printed so that the width is reduced to the
Standard 16 frame width and the leftover area top and bottom of the
frame printed in black, as in Figure 21.12.
This is an excellent option, since the grain structure of the print
stock is so ﬁne that when projected it will look very nearly as good as
a Super 16 print.The only problem is that when it is shown it will seem
a small frame, vertically, compared with Standard 16. If you can have a
word with the projectionist and persuade him to put a wider angle lens
on the projector and try and ﬁll the screen he would use for a 35mm
1.85:1 screening, you will be surprised how well the image looks.
Alternatively, if you have the money, scanning your Super 16 nega-
tive into a digital interface ﬁle and printing out on an Arri laser printer
can deliver truly superb images, as described earlier in this book.

High Deﬁnition – HD
Is ﬁlm dead?
No, most certainly not!
Over the past few years I have been closely connected with the
introduction of HD and, while I believe the pictures can be wonderful,
the reasons for choosing to shoot with HD, as opposed to ﬁlm, are not
as numerous as it ﬁrst appeared.
Three-chip cameras
The ﬁrst wave of HD cameras with their three-chip conﬁguration
were, and indeed still are, able to emulate the quality of image obtain-
able when using 35mm ﬁlm, but only if you used the ﬁnest lenses.
Many so-called HD lenses produced a picture nowhere near the cam-
era’s capability, which caused the cameras to get a mixed reception.
Those that saw demonstration ﬁlms shot with top quality lenses, such
as Panavision’s, were usually impressed and those that saw material
from poorer glass were usually disappointed.
In some areas the HD three-chip format was very successful. For
instance, within three years of the introduction of HD, nearly half the
multi-episodic, multi-camera shoots for US television were shot using
HD. Here the attraction is clear, with quality virtually the same as the
three-perforation pull-down 35mm cameras that have traditionally
been used to shoot these shows, and recording medium costing around
one-fortieth the price (yes, 1/40!), the sums really worked in HD’s
favour.
Star Wars – Attack of the Clones, the ﬁrst full-length feature ﬁlm shot
on HD – looked very good indeed. Photographed by David Tattersall
BSC, I could hardly tell if I was watching a mechanically projected
print or a digitally projected image, and both versions were excellent.
George Lucas, it is said, prefers the digital version. But why shoot a
picture costing over $1000000 on HD? Surely not to save money – no,
here the advantage was the ability to go straight from the camera mas-
ter image directly to the computers that would be used for the huge
198

Practical Cinematography
199
amount of image post-production without leaving the digital domain.
The need to carry out a lot of digital post-production is a powerful
argument for originating on HD.
Single-chip cameras
Matters have moved forward and several manufacturers have intro-
duced single-chip cameras, where the chip is approximately the size of
the frame used in 35mm photography and some of them have, effect-
ively, twice the resolution of the ﬁrst generation three-chip cameras.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of these cameras is their use of exactly
the same lenses as 35mm ﬁlm cameras. It remains to be seen if these
cameras will increase the popularity of shooting feature ﬁlms in the
digital format.
Digital presentation
There are clear ﬁnancial advantages for the distributors of feature
ﬁlms if cinemas are equipped with digital projectors of sufﬁcient qual-
ity such that the audience are unaware of the change from mechanical
to digital projectors.The savings come in some surprising places.In the
distribution chain, it is said that the cost of transporting ﬁlm prints, i.e.
vans etc., from theatre to theatre is more than the cost of producing
the prints themselves. If this is the case, were it possible to deliver the
virtual digital image by,say,ﬁbre-optic or satellite,a large cost of deliver-
ing the images to the cinema would be saved.
The other side of the distribution dilemma is interesting, as the dis-
tributors do not own the projectors: the exhibitors own the cinemas
and the projectors, so the cost of conversion would fall on the shoul-
ders of the exhibitors, who are unlikely to make any extra proﬁt from
the change-over. Currently, the comparable price of a digital projector
able to give a picture of comparable quality to a mechanical projector
is substantial, an HD projector costing some three times as much as
the mechanical equivalent.
Conclusions
HD digital cinema, I believe, is bound to come but I suspect slowly, as
there are many obstacles to overcome,though few of these are of a tech-
nical nature – all the required delivery systems and projection equip-
ment are available today. It will need an important agreement between
the distributors and the exhibitors for the revolution to happen.
There will be some ﬁlms that will cry out to be shot in the digital HD
format and others that will not. Futuristic and hyper-realistic movies,
together with those requiring a lot of digital post-production, will be
well suited to HD, though I believe that for many years to come the
more human story-based movies will still shoot on ﬁlm.Why? Because
there is over 100 years of history and knowledge in how to stir the
emotions of an audience, via their eyes, that lies vested in that peculiar
controlled rotting of silver. We Directors of Photography have been
successfully giving our audience pictures they love, and know how to
emote to, on ﬁlm for those 100 years or so – long may it continue.
