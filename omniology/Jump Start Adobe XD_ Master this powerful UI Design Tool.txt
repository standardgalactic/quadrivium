Preface
Adobe Experience Design CC (otherwise known as Adobe XD, for short) is a
minimalist desktop app for designers that need to:
1.
Design user interfaces
2.
Prototype user flows and interactions
3.
Export image assets for the development of apps and websites
While you can accomplish all three of these things (in one way or another) using
the two biggest design apps on the market today – Photoshop and Sketch – Adobe
XD is the only tool to offer design and prototyping functionality natively, and
that’s why it’s quickly becoming a top contender in the design space.
Adobe XD is everything a designer needs, right out of the box.
Why Adobe XD Exists
Bohemian Coding built Sketch because user-interface designers needed a design
application that was focused on the needs of user-interface designers. Since
Adobe Photoshop is a multi-disciplinary design tool (it was originally aimed at
photographers), the app had an abundance of features that weren’t relevant to
user-interface designers. However, while Sketch simplified the designing
experience, its makers neglected to create a Windows version of the app, nor
include any prototyping tools (Sketch requires third-party plugins for this).
Adobe built Adobe XD to re-enter the competition – by offering the same
minimalist experience as Sketch, but with added tools that Sketch is yet to
introduce (ie, prototyping tools), and by releasing a Windows version (which
Bohemian Coding said it would never do). It’s assumed that even Adobe
recommends that user-interface designers should switch from Adobe Photoshop
to Adobe XD – but what about Sketch users? Let's take a quick look.
xii
Jump Start Adobe XD

Photoshop vs. Sketch vs. Adobe XD
Choosing an app isn't about which one is best. It comes down to your individual
needs, and what you’re already familiar with.
Photoshop, for example, is very multi-disciplinary, and many of the tools are
aimed at photography experts and those who need to manipulate bitmap images.
UI designers simply don't need most of the features that Photoshop offers, which
is why Adobe sought to create a desktop app dedicated to crafting user interfaces.
Sketch, on the other hand, is specifically aimed at UI designers, but isn't available
for Windows, nor does it offer prototyping tools natively, both of which Adobe
XD does. Sketch users must download plugins to extend their workflow. So if
you’re already a happy user of InVision, Marvel, or some other kind of
prototyping tool that integrates with Sketch, and you’re a macOS user, then you
might be better suited to Sketch.
If you're a macOS user and you think Sketch could also be a contender for your
design workflow, then check out my book Jump Start Sketch, which is also
available on SitePoint Premium.
Figma is another tool that’s been gaining some traction lately. It's a user-interface
design tool for both Windows and macOS, but again, without prototyping tools.
Now we know more about these design tools, I think we should summarise them:

Chapter
Getting Familiar with the UI
In the first chapter of this book we'll familiarise ourselves with the XD interface
before taking a very hands-on approach to low-fidelity prototyping. All of the
screenshots in this book are taken from the macOS version of Adobe XD.
However, the walkthroughs (and shortcuts) are applicable to Windows, too.
If you're switching from Sketch, you'll notice many similarities in Adobe XD
(both visually and in terms of features). Although if you're switching from
Photoshop, Adobe XD will still feel like an Adobe app in some ways, even if it
doesn’t look like it, or some of the features seem a little unfamiliar to you.
Here's a swift comparison of XD (above) and Sketch (below).

Jump Start Adobe XD

1-1. Sketch vs. XD
Before We Begin
You can download Adobe XD via Creative Cloud like any other Adobe app. So if
you already have a Creative Cloud subscription, you're all set. If not, you can start
your Creative Cloud trial right here.
Let's dive in.
Workspace
Your workspace is comprised of an unlimited canvas and the artboards inside it.
Artboards typically represent one webpage or one app screen in your design,
Adobe XD Is Still Under Active Development
It's worth noting that Adobe are actively developing XD. It is already a very
versatile and powerful tool, but new features are continually being added in
monthly updates. It is also important to note that, as of this writing, the Windows
version of the app hasn't yet got all the features of the macOS version, but the
Adobe team are working hard to get both versions on par. The best place to stay up-
to-date with the latest XD developments is the official Adobe blog.

where their size depends on the dimensions of the browser window or device
screen that you’re designing for. Your workspace can contain as many artboards
as necessary, even if they’re all different sizes.
Welcome Screen
When you open the app you'll see a welcome screen that asks you to specify what
type of artboard you'd like to start with. It's commonplace to demonstrate what
your design would look like on different desktop and device screens, effectively
creating an adaptive design (that is, a design that adapts to the device/screen it’s
been viewed on). It’s also widely accepted that you should start with the smallest-
sized screen first (if you’re designing for the web, this is known as a mobile-first
approach to design).
Why Mobile-First
Why? Because designing on smaller screens forces you to design with simplicity
in mind. It’s much harder to scale down a design for smaller screens than it is to
scale up a design for larger screens. If you were creating a responsive web design
you would start with a mobile artboard and work up to tablets and then desktop
screens. If you were designing an iOS app, you’d start with the smallest iPhone
and work up to iPad, then iPad Pro.
Over the course of this book we’ll be designing and prototyping an iOS app, so
choose iPhone 6/7 to start off.

Here's our very first artboard!

Canvas
As I mentioned, the canvas is unlimited. All artboards will be visible on the
canvas at once, making it easy to flip back-and-forth between the different
screens. Any objects that aren't inside an artboard are automatically inserted into
what's called the pasteboard – a separate artboard for scattered objects.
Artboards
When you need to create new artboards, tap A and select a device from the
inspector on the right-hand side. If you need a custom-size artboard (maybe you'd
like to have your app icons in the same document), tap A and draw out the
artboard using the mouse, rather than select one from the inspector.
Ready-Made UI Kits
Like Sketch, Adobe XD has three pre-made UI kits – Apple iOS, Google Material
and Microsoft Windows. You can extract native OS design elements from these to
use in your mockups, although we’ll be focusing on designing a custom UI.
1-4. UI kits

Jump Start Adobe XD

1-5. Creating new artboards
In some cases, your content will exceed the dimensions of the screen. If you
select the artboard and drag the handles you'll be able to resize it, but you'll also
notice a dashed, blue line, which indicates the boundaries of the viewport (the
above-the-fold content). Anything below the fold is accessed by scrolling, which
you can do when testing prototypes in real devices. We'll definitely explore that
later in the book!
Getting Familiar with the UI

1-6. Resizing the viewport
You can change the viewport height at any time using the inspector, and you can
also turn the viewport off completely if you don't want the screen to be scrollable
in live preview mode.

Over the course of the book we’ll create many artboards, eventually wrapping up
with the following end result:
1-8. End result
Prototype Workspace
Adobe XD has an equally important secondary workspace called the Prototype
workspace, and this is where we:
1.
Link screens together with transitions
2.
Create video demonstrations of our design
3.
Prototype (test) the design in a browser or device
4.
Share the prototype with teammates to request feedback
Prototyping is where Adobe XD outshines Photoshop and Sketch, and we’ll be
using this workspace almost as often as the Design workspace.
Prototyping isn’t about throwing together a few fancy transitions to impress our
clients and teammates; creating prototypes and testing them in real devices is
integral to crafting exceptional UX. It helps us identify flaws that we wouldn’t
ordinarily discover by simply looking at the design.

Toolbar
As in Photoshop, the toolbar appears on the left-hand side, so let's run through
the tools, along with their keyboard shortcuts (the same on both macOS and
Windows):
Move (M)
Rectangle (T)
Ellipse (E)
Line (L)
Pen (P)
Text (T)
Artboard (A)
Zoom-In (Z)
1-9. Accessing the toolbar
Use the Shortcuts
I find that the zoom-in and zoom-out keyboard shortcuts are easier than using the
zoom tool or the application toolbar, which are Cmd + and Cmd - on macOS and
Ctrl + and Ctrl - on Windows.
9
Jump Start Adobe XD

Layer List
In Adobe XD, the layer list appears on the left-hand side when you use the
keyboard shortcut Cmd + Y (Ctrl + Y in Windows), or when you click the layer
list icon in the very bottom-left corner of the app window. Photoshop, by default,
always displayed the layer list on the right-hand side, but Adobe took a little
inspiration from Sketch on this one.
Layers are the smallest of components that make up your design. Layers can be
shape layers, text layers, bitmap layers, etc.
1-10. Opening the layer list
It's here that you'll see a hierarchical tree of your artboards, groups and layers.
But what makes this interface so special, compared with other design apps, is
that the layer list only displays the contents of the currently selected artboard,
which reduces distraction. You only see what you need to see.
Getting Familiar with the UI
10

1-11. Layer hierarchy
Property Inspector
When you need to style layers, the inspector is your friend. It's here that you
define your backgrounds, fills, borders, border radii, shadows, widths, heights,
rotation degrees, and so on. You can also activate Repeat Grids from here, as well
as specify alignments and boolean operations. As you may have seen earlier,
there are settings unique to artboards and so only appear when an artboard is
selected (and the same for text).
11
Jump Start Adobe XD

1-12. Accessing the inspector
Don't worry, we'll learn how to use all of these features in the following chapter.
Application Toolbar
Aside from the zoom dropdown, this toolbar mostly deals with prototyping tools.
Here you can switch between the Design and Prototype workspaces, connect to a
mobile device (for testing user flows and interactions), preview prototypes in
Adobe XD itself, or share prototypes to receive feedback and comments.
In the six chapters to come, we're going to learn all about prototyping with Adobe
XD, while designing a sample app. But if you're not into hands-on learning, you
can still follow us on the journey using the screenshots in this book. It's totally
up to you!

Next: Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity
Prototyping
In the next chapter we'll dive straight into low-fidelity prototyping. Now that
we're familiar with the UI of Adobe XD, we'll be learning how to use the basic
design tools while digitally mocking up the rough idea for our app.
As mentioned earlier, the end result will contain various screens that will make
up our finished app design. This app design will be based on Adobe XD’s official
iOS app, Dishy — a location-based food-ordering app.
See you there!

Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity
Prototyping
In Chapter 1 we took a tour of Adobe XD, and even looked into the keyboard
shortcuts of the most common tools. This should give us a good foundation to
work with as we explore more of Adobe XD, then go on to design a low-fidelity
mockup of an app.
Welcome Screen
When you first open Adobe XD, as with most design apps, you'll see a welcome
screen that asks you to either select a ready-made UI kit, or start a new design
from scratch (by choosing an artboard). You can also choose to reopen an existing
file.
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
14

UI Kits
As mentioned in the previous chapter, Adobe XD offers UI kits for Apple iOS,
Google Material and Microsoft Windows — these kits contain native UI elements
found in the operating system, and you can use them to design quicker mockups
rather than recreate these elements yourself. If you were building an iOS app, for
example, you could use the Apple iOS kit to extract native design components,
such as the status bar or toggle buttons.
2-1. Adobe XD UI kits
Choosing an Artboard
Over the course of this book we'll be designing a food-ordering iOS app using the
standard-size iPhone 7 as a base. So select iPhone 6/7 from the list of artboards,
and let's start prototyping.

2-2. Choosing an artboard
Returning to an Existing Project
If you already have a design that you've been working on, you can hit Cmd + O
(Ctrl + O in Windows) to find and open it. Or simply select it from the list of
Recent Files, if you've not long ago opened it.

2-3. Opening files
Low-Fidelity Prototyping
Low-fidelity prototyping is about conceptualising ideas in their most basic form
— without typography, color or any aesthetics. Why waste time thinking about
the visuals when you haven’t solidified the layout and the user experience yet?
Our current objective is to use Adobe XD to mock up an idea that you might have
already explored with some good old-fashioned pen and paper. After that, when
we have our low-fidelity mockup in Adobe XD, we’ll use the (rather awesome)
prototyping tools to demonstrate user flows (how screens link to other screens),
and then ask for feedback.
Over the course of this book, this low-fidelity mockup will evolve into a dynamic,
working prototype, then into a high-fidelity prototype with colors, icons, fonts,
etc.
17
Jump Start Adobe XD

Our low-fidelity mockup will be heavily based on Adobe XD’s official UI kit,
Dishy, which you can download here if you’d like to take a look now.
Getting Started with Shape Layers
Let's begin with our app’s welcome screen. This will consist of the logo, an
introductory sentence, and some actionable components such as a navigation bar
and search bar.
We’ll start by drawing out a few rectangles that will define the basic structure of
our screen, where the search function will be the focus. Press R to select the
Rectangle shape tool.
Now, using the mouse, draw the rectangle until it reaches the full width of the
artboard (375px), and 445px in height. You can check these values using the
inspector on the right-hand side.
2-4. Creating a rectangle
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
18

Snapping Layers to Specific Points
If you begin by hovering your mouse over the top-left corner of the artboard, the
mouse will automatically snap to that specific location, and when you drag
towards the edges of the canvas, the rectangle edges will snap there too (and
other layers, if there are any available). By snapping, Adobe XD is assuming
you’ll want to align the layer from (or to) that specific location.
Designing With the Inspector
If you found it difficult to create an exact height of 445px (this can be difficult
with some mice), use the inspector to declare the height manually by inputting
the exact value into the field (the H field in this case). You shouldn’t encounter
any troubles with the width field (W) because Adobe XD will have automatically
snapped the shape to the artboard edge.
Now let's create two more rectangles. One will resemble a search field and the
other its submit button. Let's start with the submit button.
Create another rectangle, but this time as a 73 x 73px square — hold Shift while
drawing the shape to maintain aspect ratio.
Drag it so that it snaps to the bottom-right corner of the other rectangle, but first,
tap Esc to unfocus from the layer and then Esc once more to revert back to the
move tool.
Using the Arrow Keys
You can also use the arrows keys to change the values — the ↑key will increase the
value by 1, and the ↓key will decrease it by 1. If you hold Shift while using the
arrow keys, the value will increase or decrease by 10 instead of 1.
19
Jump Start Adobe XD

2-5. More rectangles
Repeat this step with another rectangle — 304 x 73px — and drag it to the
bottom-left of our original, larger rectangle.
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
20

2-6. Even more rectangles
Text Layers
At the moment it’s not quite clear what we have here. We know that this is a
search function, but anybody testing our prototype wouldn’t be aware of that, so
it’s important to add context to low-fidelity mockups. We’re going for minimalist,
not vague. With that in mind, let's add some text to the input field.
Why You Should Specify Font Sizes Early
When designing low-fidelity screens, you need to be very aware of space. Why?
Because you can massively overestimate or underestimate the effects of inserting
images, defining fonts, and creating styles later down the line (this is the stage we
call high-fidelity prototyping). It would be devastating to realise that the
wonderful lo-fi design we’ve mocked up, which offers a terrific user experience,
doesn’t look or respond very well once the visuals have been added.
21
Jump Start Adobe XD

While low-fidelity mockups are supposed to be basic/minimal, we need to be
somewhat realistic with the concept of space. When it comes to drawing shapes I
mean the width and height values, but when it comes to text I mean the font size.
If you think you’ll use a simple sans-serif font in your final design, then stick to a
sans-serif system font like Helvetica in your low-fi mockup.
Creating Text Layers
Begin this next step by tapping T for Text on the keyboard and clicking on the
canvas where you want the text to appear. We want this text layer to be fluid (ie,
to resize automatically depending on the text value), so there’s no need to draw
this layer. Fluid text layers have their width and height attributes disabled in the
inspector. You have to wrap content manually by adding line breaks using Return
(Enter in Windows).
As for the text value, type “Seafood”, since this is a food app.
Keep tapping Esc until you revert back to the move tool, and drag-align the text
layer towards the left of the input field.
By default, the font should be Helvetica Neue, and the weight should be Regular,
but you should change the font size to 14px using the inspector. Right now, the
color doesn’t matter.
Helvetica Neue is a system font that would closely resemble the sans-serif font
we’ll choose later; 14px is an appropriate font size considering its use.
Remember, space and sizing is your focus here, not colors, fonts and other
aesthetics.
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
22

2-7. Fluid text layer
Now let's add some text that describes what the app does, since this is the
welcome screen. Press T for Text again, but this time draw out the text field using
the mouse so we can edit the width and height attributes. We’ll estimate the
width at 190px and let the text run on for two lines. Make up some lorem ipsum
dummy text for the time being. The text will automatically wrap to the second
line because we drew out this text layer and defined a width, as opposed to
creating a fluid layer.
For now you can insert this text layer anywhere in the lower-third of the screen,
but do ensure the font size is 24px — this is the main heading of our screen, so it
needs to stand out.
Also, hit the center align button in the inspector.

2-8. Fixed text layer
Duplicating Layers
You can duplicate layers with the keyboard shortcut Cmd + D (Ctrl + D in
Windows), but also by holding Option (Alt in Windows) and dragging the layer,
effectively creating a copy. Choose one of the methods and duplicate the main
heading text layer, then change the font size of this new text layer to 14px — this
will be used as secondary text.
Grouping Layers
Grouping layers allows us to combine layers so they can be moved dependant of
one another (or simply because it’s cleaner/neater to combine related layers). For
Use the Inspector to Set a Suitable Height
Remember, if you’re drawing-out text layers, neither the width nor height attributes
will be fluid, so make sure your text layers are of a suitable height by using the
inspector.

example, if we want to move our input field, inclusive of the text layer and the
submit button, we can select all the layers at once (click each one while holding
Shift) and use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + G (Ctrl + G in Windows) to group
them together.
You can ungroup layers by selecting the group and hitting Cmd + Shift + G (Ctrl +
Shift + G in Windows).
While we’re here, repeat these steps with the text layers that describe what the
app does. Grouping should become habitual, as it’s a neat way to keep your
design organised as it develops.
Smart Guides
Smart Guides were originally introduced in Sketch and later adopted in
Photoshop after the feature became a hit. Adobe XD explains them in their help
section: “When you move an object or artboard, use Smart Guides to align the
selected object or artboard to other objects or artboards. The alignment is based
on the geometry of objects and artboards. Guides appear as the object approaches
the edge or center point of other objects."
Let me start by saying than an object is a common term used to describe a shape
layer, text layer, group or bitmap on the canvas. Basically, any type of layer or
group is an object.
Guides are visual cues that illustrate how objects align to one another — they can
display the distance between two layers, or indicate whether or not a layer has
snapped to the bounds of another object or artboard edge. Adobe XD will try to
anticipate where you want to move a layer, and automatically snap to that
location when you draw close to it, while showing how far you have left until
you reach it. You can work out the distance manually by selecting the first layer,
holding Option/Alt, and hovering over the second layer.
Click-Through
Double-click or Cmd + click to select layers inside groups — this is known as
“click-through”.
25
Jump Start Adobe XD

Manual Alignments
Let's start by aligning a layer manually, so we understand the difference. A
moment ago we grouped two text layers together — select both of them once more
(hold Shift while you click them) and click the Align Center (Horizontally) button
in the Inspector, or use the shortcut: Cmd + Control + C (Shift + C in Windows).
2-9. Manually centering layers
Smart Guides When Moving Layers
Now select the actual group. You can either use the Select tool (keyboard
shortcut: V) and select the group by clicking on it, or use the Esc key to traverse
up to the parent container, which is the group. Move it until two things happen:
1.
It appears 28px below the form
2.
It snaps to the dead-center of the artboard horizontally
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
26

You’ll know you’ve done this correctly because the colored lines of the smart
guides will illustrate what the object has snapped to (which will be the dead-
center of the artboard, as indicated by the vertical line that appears). You'll also
notice the relative distance between the search function group and the welcome
text group (as indicated by the numerical value).
2-10. Aligning with smart guides
Smart Guides With Option/Alt-Hold
Select the bottom-most layer of this group, hold Option (Alt in Windows), then
hover the cursor over the top-most layer. This is a manual approach (also known
as Option/Alt-hold) to measuring the relative distance between two layers. You
can move layers as normal while option-holding, so use the ↑→↓←arrow keys
until the distance is 5px.
27
Jump Start Adobe XD

2-11. Guides with option/alt-hold
Let's use what we've learned to add some more elements. So far we’ve taken our
first look at shape layers, text layers, grouping of layers, alignments, smart guides,
and some other basics. Let's recap some of that and finish off this screen, starting
with a bottom navigation component with four links.
Create a rectangle that’s 345 x 44px (44px, width and height, is the minimum size
for a tap target — tap targets smaller than this are very hard for the user to tap).
Use Option/Alt-Hold to ensure that the rectangle has a 15px margin on three
sides.
Learning the Basics with Low-Fidelity Prototyping
28

2-12. Recapping smart guides
Now we have the basic shape of the navbar component.
Draw another rectangle where the width is 25% of the navbar’s total width
(because we’ll need to create four links inside the navbar, where each link is 25%
of the total width). Start your draw from the top-left corner of the navbar’s
rectangle. You’ll see the smart guides again, indicating that your draw will snap
from the corner of that layer, which is what we want.
29
Jump Start Adobe XD

2-13. Drawing with snap
With the Ellipse (E) tool, draw a 14 x 14px circle (hold Shift to maintain aspect
ratio) and group together the navbar link and circle, which substitutes for a
navbar icon for the time being. Duplicate this group three times and drag each
one horizontally to distribute them evenly inside the navbar.
Finally, group the entire component.

30

2-14. Forming a component
Renaming Layers
We now have a lo-fi mockup of the navbar, but we also have a lot of objects that
are named “rectangle” and “group”, which is confusing if you’re trying to locate a
layer within the layer list.
At this moment in time there’s no shortcut for renaming layers, so you’ll have to
double-click on the layer’s name in the layer list, and rename it by typing in a
new name for the layer. Renaming layers helps you maintain cleanliness in your
design, and makes the layer list look a lot less confusing.
31
Jump Start Adobe XD

2-15. Renaming layers
Wrap up this screen by creating three more layers:
1.
A rectangle, renamed to “Logo BG”
2.
A text layer called “DISHY”
3.
A group to contain these two layers, renamed to “Logo”
Centralise the group horizontally/vertically in the top space.

2-16. Wrapping up the first screen
Fast-Forward
Fast-forward 30 minutes and we have an additional screen. When the user has
searched for a type of cuisine using the form on the welcome screen, they’re then
invited to set their location so the app can return results relevant to the user's
location.
In the next chapter we’ll prototype/demonstrate this user flow, but for now let's
finish mocking up this screen while learning about Adobe XD’s other design
tools. From the archive, grab the support file named C2.xd to continue.

2-17. Fast-forward
Repeat Grids
Repeat grids allow you to repeat objects horizontally and/or vertically — it’s a
much quicker way of duplicating and distributing objects so you won’t have to
duplicate and position them manually. Select the “Recent Locations” group from
the “Set Location” artboard I’ve added into the support file, and hit the “Repeat
Grid” button in the inspector, or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + R (Ctrl + R in
Windows).

2-18. Make repeat grid
You’ll notice that this component now has two tuggable handles. Pull the right
one to repeat the component horizontally, and the bottom one to repeat it
vertically. In this case, we want to repeat it vertically, so move forward and do
that. Note that it doesn’t matter if the content overflows the artboard; in fact, in
the next chapter we’ll learn all about scrollable prototypes.

If you use the cursor to hover over the space in between the repeated objects,
you’ll be able to click and drag that space to adjust it. Adjust the spacing to 20px

Prototyping User Flows and Receiving
Feedback
Now we have two screens in our design – a welcome screen with a search
function, and a location filter screen with a list of recently selected locations.
Let's demonstrate how the user would flow from one screen to the other. This is
the first time we’ll be switching to the “Prototype” workspace, but it won’t be the
last.
So we have more screens to work with, I’ve once again added another low-fidelity
screen to the design. This is the screen that the user sees after selecting a type of
food and a location where they’d like to eat (the Search Results screen). I’ve also
downloaded and copied some temporary icons into the mockup (we’ll learn
about using vectors and iconography in Chapter 6).

Prototyping Interactions
Let's start by linking the welcome screen to the location filter screen, effectively
demonstrating a user flow where the user searches for a type of cuisine, and is
then asked to specify where they’d like to eat in the location filter screen. Click
on the right arrow icon (inside the input field on the welcome screen), where a
blue arrow-tab will appear alongside it.

Drag and drop this blue tab into the location filter screen. A user flow will have
been created, and a small modal will appear where you can specify transition
settings for this user flow – that is, how the screen will transition into the next
one (the type of animation effect, the duration of that animation, etc).

42

3-5. Flow and transition settings
Later on (when we learn how to preview/test our prototypes), we’ll be able to
literally click on this icon and be taken to the next screen, as if we were using a
real app — this is how we (and our developers, and maybe even our clients) use
the prototype workspace to test our concept before committing to it.
Next, we’ll specify the transition settings for this user flow.
Designing Transitions
Animation comes with its own set of UX challenges. A slow transition can make
the user feel like your app is taking too long, whereas a transition that’s too fast
can leave the user wondering what even happened. And then there’s the style of
the transition itself. You don’t need to do a fade-flip-slide combo to wow the user,
a subtle motion is enough to illustrate the result of the user interaction. Let's
explore some of the transitions and transition settings that we can use in Adobe
XD.
Target (what the screen transitions into):
None: Essentially removes the flow
Previous Artboard: Returns to previous screen
43
Jump Start Adobe XD

[Artboard Name]: Links to another screen
Transition (the visual effect):
None: No transition
Dissolve: Simple fade transition
Slide Left: Slides over from the left
Slide Right: Slides over from the right
Slide Up: Slides over from the top
Slide Down: Slides over from the bottom
Push ←/→/↑/↓: Same as slide transition, except the screen sliding in
pushes the current screen out
Easing (the speed of each interval of the transition):
Ease-Out: Transition will start at full speed/finish slowly
Ease-In: Transition will start slowly/finish at full speed
Ease-In-Out: Start slow, full-speed at middle, finish slow
None: The transition will not accelerate/decelerate (linear)
Duration: Overall time it takes for the transition to complete
For further reading on easings (notably, the different types of easings and their
effect on user experience), check out my article on micro-interactions and
easingson SitePoint.
Because we linked the welcome screen to the set location screen, the Target
setting has already been defined. Slide Left is a suitable option for the Transition
setting because it creates motion (the destination screen slides in from the right,
implying that it was the next screen in a series of screens — this is the default
setting on iOS and some areas of Android).
Ease-out is a suitable easing for this user flow because it forces the animation to
be faster at the beginning, creating a seemingly swift transition that doesn’t delay
the user too much, then gracefully slows down so the user has a little extra time
Using Transitions
Page transitions are less common on websites, therefore a None transition is quite
normal for website prototypes. Some web-apps on the other hand do support
transitions, which is why the transition options are nonetheless available in all
cases.

to understand what’s happened. In most cases, the default Duration setting of 0.4
seconds is more than optimal.
Let's roll with these settings.
3-6. First screen settings
From the Set Location screen, create a user flow back to the Welcome Screen.
Select Previous Artboard as the Target, which will automatically reverse the
transition last used. For example, if you used Slide Left to enter the screen, Slide
Right will be used as you return to the previous screen.

3-9. And vice-versa
At any moment you can click on an artboard to see an overview of which screens
link to it, and which screens it links to. Prototyping is wonderfully visual in
Adobe XD!
While apps like Marvel, Framer, Origami and InVision are certainly more
powerful when it comes to prototyping (functionality like fixed elements,
dynamic input fields and embeddable web content has existed in these apps for a
while now), Adobe XD releases feature updates on a monthly basis. It’s catching
up fast, and each version is reasonably stable.
Besides that, Adobe XD offers something that no other design app does: a unified
design + prototyping experience. XD is not a companion to a design app like
Photoshop or Sketch, it is the design app, and the prototyping app. Being able to
seamlessly switch between the Design and Prototype workspaces makes
designing and prototyping with Adobe XD silky smooth.

Creating Scrollable Prototypes
Secondly, we have overflowing content in Search Results. However, we can’t
scroll down to view this content when previewing the prototype in Desktop

3-14. Resizing an artboard
Will this undesirably make the screen longer in Desktop Preview mode? No,
because the viewport height is still 667px – this is the height in which you view
the prototype (as indicated by the dashed blue line in Design mode) versus its
total height.

Creating Sticky Elements
Even though you can scroll prototypes, we cannot (yet) create sticky elements like
fixed headers and footers, hence why the navigation component floats awkwardly
in place (it doesn’t remain on the screen while you scroll). Adobe have assured me
this is a feature they’re working on right now.

Now that we’ve ironed out the creases, let's test our prototype on a real device.
Desktop Preview is fine for first-round testing, but this is a mobile app that’s

Getting Visual with the Property Inspector
In this chapter we’ll learn about the property inspector, adding styles to our low-
fidelity prototype as we transition our design into a high-fidelity mockup with
colors, fonts and images. We’ll start by learning about all the styles available to
us, as well as how to customise them. Then we’ll work on our design using those
styles.

We were briefly introduced to the inspector in the first chapter of this book. And
in the second and third chapters, we touched on some of its features (artboard

selection, vertical scrolling, layer alignment and repositioning, etc). Now we’ll
learn about its other uses, ie, its ability to style layers.
Let's run through the various styling options available (what they do, how to
customise them, etc) before we continue with the walkthrough. For now, you can
simply sit back and read.
Dimensions and Offsets
W: defines the width of an object
H: defines the height of an object

Opacity
Opacity defines how transparent an object is, and is the first styling option under
the Appearance heading. Adjust the slider to choose a value between 0% and
100%, or use the number keys (1-9) to define a value manually. Here are a few
examples:
1: 10%
3: 30%
1, then 3 in rapid succession: 13%
0: 100% (opaque)
0, then 0 in rapid succession: 0% (invisible)
4-4. Changing the object opacity
Corner Radius
Corner Radius defines the roundness of corners on rectangle shape layers. By
default, the Same radius for all corners button is selected, and the default value is
69
Jump Start Adobe XD

0. If you had a rectangle shape layer and changed this value to 100, each corner of
the rectangle would be rounded by a value of 100px.
4-5. Styling the corner radius
Different radius for each corner (hover over the buttons to reveal the tooltips, if
you’re not sure) will allow the corner radius to take four values instead of one —
one value for each corner in clockwise order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right,
bottom-left.
50, 50, 0, 50, for instance, would create a corner radius of 50px on each corner of
the rectangle, except the bottom-right one.
Check the Tooltips
Not every styling option has a label describing what that option does. If you’re not
sure, and you don’t want to refer to this book, hover over the button/option with
the cursor to reveal the descriptive tooltip.

4-6. Styling complex corner radii
Fill
Fill is used to determine the color of a text/shape layer. Click on the rectangular
color sample (next to the Fill label in the inspector) to reveal the color picker,
where you can then specify a color value for the currently selected layer.
71

4-7. Revealing the color picker
Color Format
Adobe XD supports HSBA (Hue, Saturation, Brightness, Alpha) or Hex color
formats.
Getting Visual with the Property Inspector
72

4-8. Color formats
Color Palette
If you click on the large square block on the left of the color picker, you’ll be able
to roughly change the saturation and brightness of the chosen color. And with the
slider that follows (slightly to the right), you’ll be able to change the color itself
(the hue). With the final slider (on the far-right), you’ll be able to change the
alpha-transparency of the color — this value will only be reflected in the HSBA
format.
As you interact with this color palette, the HSBA and Hex values will update
accordingly to reflect your chosen color.
73
Jump Start Adobe XD

4-9. Choosing colors
Document Colors
Finally, at the very bottom of the color picker, there is a + icon that lets you add
the chosen color to your curated collection of commonly used document colors. If
there are any colors you’ll use multiple times (there probably will be), save them
by clicking on the + icon. All saved colors will appear right alongside the + icon.
Getting Visual with the Property Inspector
74

4-10. Document colors
Gradients
In the very top-left corner of the color picker there is a select box (it will say Solid
Color by default) that allows you to select an alternative type of fill – a Gradient.
When you select this option, another slider (with two non-adjustable handles at
both ends) will be added to the color picker. You can select and then define a
different color for each handle, and have the fill fade from one color to the next.
75

Even though these handles are non-adjustable in the color picker interface, you
can move them around on the canvas to change the direction of the color fade
effect.

4-12. Changing the fade direction
If you click anywhere on the slider between the two handles (either on the
canvas, or on the color picker), you can add an additional handle. This handle
can add an extra color to the gradient, helping you create complex color fade
effects.

Eyedropper Tool
If you want to reuse a color that already exists in the design, but you didn’t save
it to your colors collection, you can select the Eyedropper tool (which appears to
the right of the Fill label) and define a color by clicking on the canvas. A
magnifying glass will replace the mouse cursor to help you extract the desired
color accurately.

78

4-14. Extracting with the eyedropper

Border uses all the same options as Fill, except it allows for an extra numerical
value, which is the width of the border. Right now there are no other options
available (such as a dashed border) – only a solid border.

Background Blur
Background Blur changes the visibility of the content underneath the currently
selected layer (this is useful for creating semi-transparent modal dialogues, for
example).
Blur Amount: how blurry the content underneath will appear
Brightness: how light/dark the content underneath will appear
Effect Opacity: how eminent the background blur will appear (a value of
100% would ensure the effect would not be seen)

Object Blur
From the select box (where the current/default option is Background Blur), there
is another option: Object Blur. Object Blur only has one value, the Blur Amount –
how much the currently selected object will blur around the edges (you’d
probably only use this as a fancy visual effect).
Object Blur blurs the actual object, whereas Background Blur acts as a filter on
top of a background image.

We already familiarised ourselves (briefly) with text styles when we were
designing our low-fidelity mockup in chapter two. But for the sake of
completeness, let's briefly recap:
Font: defines the font of the text layer
Font Size: defines the font size (in px) of the text layer
Font Weight: defines the font weight of the text layer

Quick Exercise: Styling Layers
Now we know what each style does, let's begin styling the layers in our design.
We won’t use every style mentioned in the overview above, but we will use the
important ones at least.
Let's start with the welcome screen.
Styling the Welcome Text
Select the largest text layer in the lowest third of the screen (this will be the
heading of the welcome text). Currently, it uses “lorem ipsum” as dummy text.
Press Return to enter editing mode, and type ”Make ordering in the new going
out”.
Press Esc to exit editing mode.

4-21. Styling the heading layer
Now change the font size to 24px. Naturally, this will make the text layer larger,
so we’ll need to rearrange the text layer underneath so there is still a 5px space
between the two layers. Switch to the text layer underneath and rearrange it (the
smart guides will help you while moving the layer).

4-22. Rearranging the layers
Finally, switch back to the heading layer and change the fill color to #DF0000 (a
reddish color). Add this color to the document colors collection by clicking the +
icon.

4-23. Coloring the heading layer
Repeat these steps with the text layer underneath, changing the color to #7C7E81
and adding it to the document colors.
Styling the Form Button
Now let's style the form button.
Select the smallest rectangle in the form component (the rectangle on the far
right). Apply the following styles:
W: 44
H: 44
Corner Radius: 44
Fill: the red color from our saved document colors
Border: uncheck

side of the artboard, and a 15px space between the layer and the bottom of the
form component.

Styling the Background
Now let's add a background image to the design.
You should have noticed by now that there is an image in the Pasteboard
artboard (if you don’t remember from way back in the first chapter, any layers that
are not inside an artboard will automatically reside in the Pasteboard artboard).

above the Bounds layer (because right now the image is hiding all of our
wonderful content).

Styling the Input Field
Now, when we style the input field in the form component, it won’t disappear
into the white background of the screen. Select the input field, then add the
following styles:
W: 270
H: 44
Corner Radius: 22
Border: uncheck

4-29. Styling the input field
Move the input field layer with the arrow keys by 15px towards the bottom-right
corner of the artboard, so the layer looks more aligned with the red, circular
button.

4-30. Moving the input field
Styling the Logo
Let's quickly adjust the logo, too.
Select the Logo BG layer and delete it with the Delete key (Backspace on
Windows). Make the text layer white (#FFFFFF).
Tidying Up
Move the “Seafood” text layer and the right-arrow icon inwards, about 7px, so the
spacing of these layers looks a little more adjusted to the newly resized input field
layer.

Styling the Menu
Let's move onto the Set Location screen now, more specifically the topmost menu
component. Select the background layer of the back button (Icon BG) and apply
the following styles:
Border: uncheck
Fill: #59D0B6 (click the + icon in the color picker to add it to the document

In the next chapter, we’ll explore some of the more complex aspects of styling

Chapter
Hi-Fi Prototyping With Symbols and
Repeat Grids
In this chapter, we’ll learn two features that are designed to help you maintain
visual consistency (and save you countless hours!) when high-fidelity
prototyping. These are – how to create and use symbols, and how to automate the
process of adding styles and content to components inside repeat grids.
High-fidelity prototyping is the act of taking a validated and improved low-
fidelity mockup and adding visual styles to it — we’ll use symbols and repeat
grids to speed up this process. By the end of this chapter we’ll have a fully-styled
design, minus some icons (which we’ll tackle in the following chapter).
First, we’ll discuss why maintaining visual consistency is important, and how
symbols can help us achieve that.
Hi-Fi Prototyping With Symbols and Repeat Grids

Maintaining Visual Consistency With Symbols
When styles aren’t consistent in a design, the user finds it hard to learn how to
use the interface, and quickly becomes frustrated. When styles are consistent, the
user learns:
What certain colors represent (eg, red = error)
What certain font sizes mean (eg, largest size = a heading)
How to advance to the next stage (eg, right-aligned buttons)
A lack of visual consistency is confusing and jarring for the user, and more styles
means more code, which results in:
1.
More work for the developer/development team
2.
A bulkier codebase, which can make the app/website slower
Symbols can help us maintain visual consistency.
What Are Symbols?
Symbols help you reuse commonly used design components over and over again,
while keeping each instance of that design component visually consistent.
Imagine a search icon that appears on every screen (or at least most of them) in
the design. Now imagine that you notice something wrong with it. If you had
turned this search icon into a symbol, you would only need to edit one instance
of the search icon for the changes to reflect on every other search icon that
appears in the design. It saves you crucial amounts of time at crucial moments,
and also gives you the peace of mind that your designs are visually consistent.
Without symbols, you’d have to locate and edit every single instance of that
search icon manually. I’ll leave you to wonder how much time editing that search
icon alone could take up!
Our bottom nav component, which appears on every screen, is a terrific example
of a design component that could be used as a symbol. Let’s create a symbol from
this component and reuse it.
101
Jump Start Adobe XD

Creating Symbols
Start by selecting the bottom nav component, then switching from the layer list to
the symbols list by clicking on the symbols icon at the very bottom of the toolbar.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Shift + Y (a keyboard
shortcut for Windows has not been implemented yet).
5-1. Switching to the symbols list
Now let’s convert the bottom nav component to a symbol by clicking the + icon in
the symbols list, or by using the shortcut Cmd + K (again, no shortcut for
Windows yet).
Getting Back to the Layer List
Hit Cmd + Y (Mac only) to switch back to the layer list.
Hi-Fi Prototyping With Symbols and Repeat Grids
102

5-2. Creating a symbol
Our bottom nav component is now one instance of a symbol (until we create
more instances, that is), and you’ll also notice that a reference to the symbol now
appears in the symbols list.
103
Jump Start Adobe XD

5-3. Our first symbol
Inserting Symbols
If we made visual changes to the bottom nav component at this stage, those
changes would not be reflected in the bottom nav components on other screens.
This is because we haven’t explicitly confirmed they are instances of the symbol
we created moments ago, so we need to delete these components from the canvas,
and re-add them as linked instances.
If you think that sounds inconvenient, it’s because it is. To avoid this
inconvenience you should convert commonly used elements to symbols as you
design the first instance.
Let’s learn how to add and remove instances:
Start by selecting all the bottom nav components (not the one used to create the
symbol!) while holding Shift, then tapping Delete (Backspace in Windows) to
delete them.
Now drag our symbol from the symbol list to the exact spots where the bottom
nav components previously existed.
Hi-Fi Prototyping With Symbols and Repeat Grids
104

5-4. Creating instances of symbols
Great, now all of these symbol instances are linked.
Editing Instances
Now that all instances of the bottom nav component are linked to the symbol,
let’s style this component. We already know how to style layers, so this step
should be a total breeze.
Color Hints
Symbols are outlined in green when selected — this is to indicate/remind us that
styling the current object has ramifications for all other instances of this symbol.
You Can Edit Any Symbol Instance
It doesn’t matter which instance you make changes to, since they are all linked
together by a symbol. If you edit one instance of a symbol, all other instances of that
symbol will follow suit.

Navigate to the Navbar BG layer, either by clicking through to it on the canvas, or
by selecting it from the layer list.
5-5. Selecting the navbar background
Add a Fill of #F6F6F6, a Corner Radius of 44px (this is equal to the value of the
height, which is also 44px), and remove the border by unchecking it. While
you’re here, I’d also recommend adding this color to the document colors.
Hi-Fi Prototyping With Symbols and Repeat Grids
106

5-6. Styling the navbar background
You won’t notice any changes yet — this is because, higher up in the layer
hierarchy, each Navtab has a rectangle background that blocks the view of the
main Navbar background.
If you remember, we created these rectangle shapes (one for each navtab) back in
chapter two, to illustrate that all navtabs should have the same overall width,
regardless of how wide each icon inside the navtab is. This allows us to align the
future navbar icons within these rectangles, and ultimately distribute them
evenly across the navbar component, with complete accuracy.
Since we still require these bounds, we shouldn’t delete them; instead, we can
hide their Fill and Border styles (smart guides will still work even if we can’t see
these layers!).
107
Jump Start Adobe XD

5-7. Hiding the bounds
Now you can see the navbar background clearly, but the bounds are still there,
even if they are essentially hidden now.
Oh, and did you notice? All instances of the bottom nav component remain
visually consistent with one another, even though you’ve only edited one of the
instances. This is how symbols save us bundles of time, and offer us the peace of
mind that we’re maintaining consistency. It’s a win-win situation.

108

5-8. Visual consistency achieved
Unlinking An Instance From a Symbol
You can unlink an instance by right-clicking on it and selecting Ungroup Symbol.
Note that this will not revert it back to any previous state — it will just not be
linked to a symbol anymore, and you’ll be able to edit it independently again.
Automating Content With Repeat Grids
We learned about repeat grids — and how we can use them to repeat design
components horizontally and vertically — back in chapter two. Now let’s
discover how repeat grids can be useful in the high-fidelity prototyping stage as
we add content to our design.
We’ll Leave the Icons for Now
Don’t worry about the navbar icons — we’ll tackle icon design in the next chapter
as we learn about designing with vectors.
109
Jump Start Adobe XD

By dragging and dropping images and text files from our local computer, we can
insert content into repeat grids with very little effort. If a component was tiled 20
times using a repeat grid, you would be able to drag 20 images into the grid at
once, and Adobe XD would assign one of those images to each tile.
Let’s take our list of search results for example — we could insert one background
image into each result, all at once.
Let’s start by importing some images.
Drag and Drop Image Import
Before we can mass-import images via drag and drop, we first need to ensure that
all the images exist in the same location on our local computer. For the sake of
this tutorial, you’ll find example images you can use in the source files.
Locate the search result images within the source files, and use Cmd + A (Ctrl + A
in Windows) to select all the images at once. Now drag them into the repeat grid
in the Search Results artboard. When the background layer is highlighted, simply
drop the images, and watch as Adobe XD automatically assigns one image for
each instance of the background layer.
What Happens With Unused Images?
If the number of imported images outweighs the number of tiles, the extra images
will remain unused. If the number of tiles outweighs the number of images being
imported, Adobe XD will reuse already-imported images, resulting in duplicates.
More Color Hints
Repeat grids are also outlined in green when selected, as editing one item in a
repeat grid affects the other items.

You should end up with something like this:
5-10. Mass-importing images
111
Jump Start Adobe XD

Drag and Drop Text Import
We can also import written content into the design using the same method.
Ordinarily, we would insert written content by copying and pasting (usually
delivered by the client or marketing team), but with Adobe XD we can drop text
files containing the written content straight into the canvas.
It should be noted that each text layer requires its own text file. For instance, you
would have one text file containing the written content for all item names, and
another text file containing the written content for all item costs (I’m using the
list of search results from our app as an example here).
Each value should appear on a new line. So a text file containing the item costs
would look like this:
$19
$28
$17
$34
$48
Dragging and dropping text files is something that, at least to my knowledge, no
other design app has done before. I was quite impressed when I discovered the
ability to do this!
Before we begin importing some written content into our design, let’s quickly
style this search result component so our text layers are more visible when we
drag the content in.
Styling the Search Result Grid
Begin by tweaking two styles on the rectangle shapes (which now use our
imported images as backgrounds). Make the Opacity 60% and remove the Border
by unchecking it.

5-11. Styling the backgrounds
Now switch to the Artboard and use a Fill of #000 to mimic the effect of having a
black overlay on our background images. This will add more contrast to the text
content when we add it.

5-12. Adding a black overlay
Almost there — add two more styles:

from the content, of course).

As before, locate the text file in the source files. If you open the file, you’ll notice
it looks like this:

Salmon Sashimi
Flounder Amandine & Frites
Louisiana Seafood Boil

must be .txt format (not .rtf).

assets.

Chapter
Designing Icons and Exporting
Back when we were low-fidelity prototyping, I (on the sly) inserted some icons
into the design to add some clarity to our somewhat basic-looking wireframe. In
this chapter, we’ll learn how to design some of those icons from scratch. We’ll
explore the delicate art of icon design, as well as learn about the export feature,
which allows us to ready our image assets for the developers, who will then
implement them into the coded app.
Designing icons can be a difficult task, depending on what you’re trying to
accomplish. A slightly odd-looking shape might be easy enough to draw, but a
complex icon would require much more care. Many designers use existing icon
sets downloaded from the internet for this very reason — it’s easier and quicker.
That being said, there’s a very high chance your design will end up using the
same icons as countless other designs. While this isn’t really a big deal (it saves
Designing Icons and Exporting
118

bundles of time and billable hours for the client!), some designs require a more
unique visual aesthetic. There are also designs that need an icon for an app-
specific feature or a branded version of a common icon. So we’ll learn how to
design an icon from scratch — one search icon and one location icon.
6-1. The end result
Let's start by designing a very simple search icon.
Designing a Search Icon
We’ll begin by designing a search icon represented by a magnifying glass. This
will consist of an ellipse shape (the circular glass itself) and a rectangle shape
(the handle).
Creating an Artboard For The Search Icon
First we need a separate artboard for this icon, because we aren’t going to create
these icons directly in the design itself (that would make things a bit messy).
When we’re done, we’ll have an icon that can be scaled to any size without losing
119
Jump Start Adobe XD

quality (more on that later), then we’ll copy a version of the icon into the design
to see how it looks. Each icon will be approximately 16 x 16px, so create an
artboard of that size.
6-2. Creating an artboard
Activating Grids to Make Designing Easier
Grids can make the delicate art of designing icons so much easier, ensuring that
our shapes and spacing are uniform. Grids are specifically offset from the top-left
corner of the artboard, so by having each icon in its own artboard we can ensure
our grids have a pre-determined amount of squares.
After making sure the artboard is selected, check the Grid checkbox in the
inspector. You’ll notice that, by default, lines are set to appear on the artboard
every 8px. Since our artboard is only 16 x 16px, only two lines should be
appearing right now.

Change this setting to 1. Now we have a more refined grid to work with, and can

Designing the Search Icon
Let's create the two shapes that make up the search icon:

X and Y: 0 (snapped to the top-left)
Rectangle (R)
Fill: #000

H: 7
X and Y: 10
Rotation: 315°
Corner Radius: 1
You should have something like this:

122

6-5. Building a rough base
I know what you’re thinking — the circle shape is undesirably blocked out. We
need to carve a smaller circle out of the larger circle, and that’s where boolean
operations can be useful.
A boolean operation combines two or more layers together to create a new shape.
There are four types of boolean operations, and the one we need right now is
called Subtract. We want to create a smaller ellipse shape and use it like a stencil
to subtract from the larger ellipse. Let's do this now.
Start by creating a new ellipse shape:
W and H: 9
X and Y: 2
Fill: anything (you’ll see why shortly)
This Is Similar To Pathfinder in Illustrator
If you’re coming from an Adobe Illustrator background, you may be used to
combining shapes using the Pathfinder features. Boolean operations are pretty
much the same thing.
123
Jump Start Adobe XD

6-6. Creating a mask
We’ll use this ellipse shape as a mask (or a stencil, if that term makes more sense
to you). Now we’ll complete a boolean operation (the Subtract operation, to be
specific) to cut a hole out of the larger ellipse, using this mask/stencil.
Select both ellipse shapes, and select the Subtract boolean operation from the
inspector. It won’t actually say Subtract, but if you’re at all unsure, the tooltip
will help.
You can also use the very handy keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + S (Ctrl + Alt
+ S in Windows).
You should notice that the mask ellipse has been used to cut a hole in the larger
ellipse, and in the layer list, both layers have been combined into a single object
called Subtraction 1.
Designing Icons and Exporting
124

6-7. Our first icon is complete
You should also notice that the styles of the mask are irrelevant — when the
layers are combined, the object inherits the styles from the layer lowest in the
layer hierarchy.
Our first icon is complete!
The Mask Layer Needs to be Above the Layer That’s Being Operated
On
Just like you were physically using a stencil in the real world, the mask layer
should be *above* the layer that you want to subtract from. If it isn’t immediately
above, Adobe XD will automatically drag the layer further down the hierarchy.
You won’t need to do anything in this case, but if for any reason you’re not
achieving the desired results, carefully rearrange the layers in the layer list before
you select the boolean operation (a simple Command/Ctrl + Z will undo the
operation if you make a mistake, don’t worry).
125
Jump Start Adobe XD

Boolean Operations
We can create entirely unique shapes by using these boolean operations, as we
did only moments ago when we carved a shape out of another shape. In the
following examples, I’ll use two ellipse shapes to re-demonstrate the Subtract
operation, and also show you what the other operations can be accomplished.
All boolean operations are non-destructive. By non-destructive, I mean that we
can double-click on the combined shape (in the layer list, or on the canvas
directly) to resume editing the individual shapes even after the operation has
completed.
Add and Subtract are the two boolean operations you’ll use the most. But for the
sake of clarity (since the inspector doesn’t display any icon labels), the operations
appear in this order, from left to right: Add, Subtract, Intersect, Exclude.
We’ll start with Add.
Add Operation
Add combines two or more shapes into a single shape.
After selecting two or more shapes at once, use the keyboard shortcut Cmd +
Option + U (Ctrl + Alt + U in Windows) to combine them using the Add boolean
operation.
Before:

6-8. Before the operation

127
Jump Start Adobe XD

"Wait, if various layers are combined, and they all have styles, which styles does
the combined shape inherit?"
Well, as we saw when we used the Subtract operation on the search icon, the
layer lowest in the layer hierarchy will be used as a base, and the combined
shape will inherit the styles of this layer.
Before we move on, combine the layers that make up our search icon into a single
object using the Add operation, then reposition the combined object into the
center of the artboard.
6-10. Combining into a single shape
Subtract Operation
We already explored the Subtract operation, but for completeness I’ll explain it in
more detail here.
Designing Icons and Exporting
128

Subtract does the complete opposite to Add. The layer that appears lowest in the
layer hierarchy is used as the base, and any other shapes merged into it via a
Subtract operation cut into this base like a stencil, “subtracting” from it. In the
example below, I’m using an ellipse to subtract from another ellipse to create a
crescent moon shape.
As you did with the Add operation, select the layers you want to merge, then
click the subtract icon in the inspector, or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd +
Option + S (Ctrl + Alt + S in Windows). You should have something like this:
6-11. Subtract operation
Intersect Operation
Let's say you have two shapes that overlap each other. If you use the Intersect
operation, only the area where the two shapes intersect/overlap will be visible.
Keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + I (Ctrl + Alt + I in Windows).
In the case of these two overlapping ellipse shapes, you would end up with
something like this:
129
Jump Start Adobe XD

6-12. Intersect operation
Exclude Operation
This is the opposite of Intersect. After the selected layers are combined using the
Exclude operation, you’re left with the areas of the combined shape, where the
individual shapes aren’t overlapping. Keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + X (Ctrl
+ Alt + X in Windows).
Designing Icons and Exporting
130

6-13. Exclude operation
Editing Vector Paths
Adobe XD is a vector app, so all text and shape layers are vectors. This means we
can scale objects up and down without losing quality (a benefit that raster images
do not have).
Vectors are comprised of paths that are connected via points at certain intervals.
By adjusting these points, we can change the direction of each path, and
ultimately, the overall outline of the shape. A vector path is a generated outline
consisting of smooth, math-defined vector lines, rather than raster (bitmap) dots,
making them fully resolution-independent.
In this next exercise we’ll edit a simple ellipse into a location icon by
manipulating its vector qualities.
Designing a Location Pin Icon
Create another 16 x 16px artboard and check the Grid checkbox once again. After
switching the spacing to 1, hit the adjacent Make Default button so we don’t have
to do this every time. Now create an ellipse shape and apply the follow styles:
131
Jump Start Adobe XD

Fill: #000
W and H: 11
X: 2.5
Y: 0
Border: uncheck this
6-14. Halfway there already
Next, double-click on the ellipse to enter vector mode, where you’ll notice that
this shape has four points (one each at the north, east, south and west edges).
These are more specifically known as anchor points or anchors, and you can drag
them to manipulate the core structure of the shape.
Designing Icons and Exporting
132

6-15. Manipulating the shape
Anchor and Control Points
When you select an anchor, you’ll see two other handles appear on either side,
connected to it via a line. These two handles are called control points, and they
can be used to adjust the curvature of the path between a) the currently selected
anchor, and b) its neighboring anchors.
133
Jump Start Adobe XD

6-16. Moving the control handles
In short:
Anchor point: moving this changes the mold of the shape
Control point: moving this changes the curvature of the paths that make up
the shape
By default, anchors are mirrored. When you move one control handle, the other
handle moves in the opposite direction symmetrically (resulting in a smooth
curve effect).
In order to move a control handle asymmetrically (meaning, without the opposite
handle automatically mimicking its behaviour), hold Option/Alt while you move
it. When you hold Option/Alt, the control handle can be moved independently,
allowing for the possibility to create asymmetric shapes.
Designing Icons and Exporting
134

6-17. Asymmetrical control handles
Converting Mirrored Points to Straight Points
Paths are curved by default, as we’ve learned, and the control handles allow us to
adjust those curves. By double-clicking on the anchor, we can convert this
mirrored anchor to a straight anchor. Straight anchors do not have control
handles because there’s no curvature to control. Double-click on the bottom-most
anchor to convert it, then drag it to the bottom-center of the artboard, using the
Grid to achieve the accuracy required. Grids are handy for more complex icons.
Play Around!
With the knowledge of anchors and controls fresh in your mind, I’d advise you to
play around with some shapes, as this is the best way of learning how to draw
vectors quickly.
135
Jump Start Adobe XD

6-18. Converting anchors
Completing the Icon with a Boolean Operation
As we did with the search icon, we can use a Subtract operation to cut a hole in
the middle of the location icon. Create an ellipse shape with the following styles:
W and H: 7
X: 4.5
Y: 2
Remember, the Fill and Border styles have zero relevance, as the eventual
combined shape will inherit the styles from the base layer (icon), not the mask

Drawing Vectors with Keyboard Shortcuts
As usual, there are a few keyboard shortcuts that can help us design faster, and
with more accuracy. Let's take a look!
Shift (hold): Snap handles at 15° increments
Alt/Option (hold): Move control handle asymmetrically
Shift + Alt/Option (hold): Both of the above at once
Backspace/Delete: Delete anchor
Pen Tool
Sometimes, shape manipulations and boolean operations alone won’t help you
achieve the level of detail you desire. Occasionally, you might need to illustrate a
vector from scratch. This is a whole other skill in itself, and why many designers
find it easier (and far less time-consuming) to download and implement a ready-
made icon set (which is perfectly acceptable!).
Designing a vector from scratch really isn’t that different from what we’ve been
doing in this chapter. The only difference is you’ll need to use the Pen tool to
draw shapes. However, if you know how to work the anchor and control handles
(which you do, now!), then you know how to use the pen tool.
Press P and click anywhere on the artboard to create an anchor, then click
somewhere on the artboard to create another anchor, establishing a Path between
the two.
Keep clicking until you come full circle to the original anchor, then close the
path by clicking on the first anchor created. Paths can be split by clicking on
them, resulting in a new anchor being created underneath the mouse cursor. Press
Delete (Backspace in Windows) to delete anchors. It’s simple in theory, but it
requires a lot of practice in reality.
Finding Icons
Creative Market, Icons8, Iconfinder, UI8, The Noun Project and Dribbble are
brilliant resources for finding complete (and attractive) icon sets.

Copying Icons into the Design Itself
Next, copy and paste the icons into the design itself to make sure they look right
(sometimes, you may need to tweak the icon a little more, utilising symbols to
maintain consistency).
Here’s what the final design should look like, complete with all icons and screens
(and, as usual, you can find the full design file in the support files, so you can
take a closer look):

Using Other Apps to Create Your Vectors
Compared with a tool like Illustrator, Adobe XD is pretty basic when it comes to
drawing vectors. Many designers would agree that using Illustrator for complex
illustrations is much better. Luckily, copying and pasting vectors from Adobe
Illustrator to Adobe XD works flawlessly. You can also copy or drag SVG files from
your computer into Adobe XD — even those exported from Sketch.

Exporting Image Assets
Let's begin exporting these icons, so the developers (let’s assume we have
developers!) can begin implementing them into the coded application. The file
format, and the size we need to export these icons, depends on whether we’re
designing a website, an iOS app, or an Android app. We’re designing an iOS app,
but we’ll cover web and Android, too.
Start by selecting one or more icons, then hit Cmd + E (Ctrl + E in Windows) to
begin the export workflow. Let's run through the settings available, and learn
which ones are required for the different operating systems available today.
6-22. Starting the export workflow
Image Formats
Format specifies which file format the selected objects will be exported as — this
depends on whether you’re designing for the web, or for an iOS/Android app. We
have three options:
Designing Icons and Exporting
140

PNG: A bitmap format that cannot be scaled without losing quality; for
websites and iOS/Android operating systems
SVG: A vector format that can be scaled without losing quality; for the web
only (we’ll discuss why shortly)
PDF: An uncommon vector format for iOS/Android
Even though device resolution (ie, display size/quality) varies from device to
device, PNG formats are the norm for mobile devices, not vector formats such as
SVG. I’ll explain why.
Resolution and Platform
Device resolution is a very difficult concept to understand at first — PaintCode’s
visual explanation of iPhone resolutions is the easiest to understand (and the best
to refer back to later)1. For now, let me explain the basic concept so you know
which settings to choose when exporting your designs. Since we’re designing an
iOS app, I’ll use iOS as an example to start with.
When the iPhone was first released, it didn’t include any Retina technology, so
we exported our designs @1x. The iPhone 4 included the Retina technology,
which doubled the amount of pixels on the screen, even though the screen didn’t
physically increase in size. This meant we needed to export our assets at double
the size (@2x), resulting in better display quality.
Later, the resolution increased even further with the release of the iPhone 6 Plus,
so we needed to export images @3x (ie, the display had three times as many
pixels).
”But what if I’m designing for various iPhone devices? PNG is not a vector format,
so the images would be blurry when scaling up and down for the different device
resolutions!”

for Android devices

Well, this brings me back to image formats. Because vectors have to be
mathematically rendered (this is what makes them scalable), this is very resource-
intensive on the mobile device.
Since PNG files do not have this issue, and iOS preloads PNG files before
launching the app, this isn’t resource-intensive at all. If we export the PNG files at
@1x, @2x and @3x, iOS will then serve whichever version is relevant to the
device, resulting in high-quality, device-specific images that don’t have be
mathematically rendered each time they appear. This is the most-common and
most-recommended method of exporting assets.
“What about JPG files?”
Since JPG formats don’t support alpha-transparency (whereas PNG does), and file
size isn’t a concern for native apps, we don’t typically export image assets in JPG
format for native apps — Adobe XD doesn’t support it. We do, however, still use
JPG on the web because of its ability to be compressed into a smaller file size, so
we can expect Adobe XD to introduce JPG exports soon.
“Why are PDFs uncommon?”
Mobile apps (both iOS and Android) will convert PDFs to PNG at runtime — the
benefit is that you’ll have fewer assets to export (because PDFs are scalable), but
in exchange for a slow, more resource-intensive app. I would avoid this method
in all cases.
Now let’s explore the two remaining settings:
Export for:
Design: PNGs @1x
Web: PNGs @1x and @2x
iOS: PNGs @1x, @2x and @3x
Android: PNGs at ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi and xxxhdpi (Android
has a wider variety of device resolutions and uses different terms to
differentiate between them)
Designing Icons and Exporting
142

Designed at: This is the resolution at which the assets were designed. We
designed our assets @1x — this is the default option, the resolution at which
the artboards are created.
I would highly advise that you design @1x, as this makes it super-easy to scale up
image assets to @2x and @3x. Similarly, you should choose 100% - mdpi for
Android designs, as this is the default resolution for Android artboards.
For our design, choose the iOS and 1x options, then hit the Export button to
export the assets to the chosen location.
And we’re done!
It’s a Wrap
You did it! You learned how to design user interfaces in Adobe XD! You
visualised your idea in a low-fidelity mockup, learned how to ask for feedback,
then designed the screens to completion – and topped it off with some icons. And
hopefully it didn’t even take you that long! Don’t forget to check out the appendix
at the end of this book, where we’ll recap all the macOS and Windows keyboard
shortcuts (there’s a handy PDF cheatsheet for you to download as well, in case
you forget them later).
We’ll also revisit some of those repetitive tasks that can be time-consuming if
you’re not using the keyboard shortcuts.
I’ll see you there!

Appendix A: Accelerating Workflows with
Keyboard Shortcuts
In this final chapter we’ll explore how keyboard shortcuts can accelerate our
prototyping workflow. We learned several of these shortcuts throughout the book,
but we’ll recap all of them here, as well as learn about any that we missed along
the way. On top of that, we’ll explore certain repetitive tasks and see how we can
speed them up using shortcuts.
Keyboard Shortcut Workflows
We’ll start with those repetitive (or easy-to-forget) tasks.
Quickly Reorganise Your Workspace
Switching up your workspace is super-easy. Here are the three keyboard shortcuts
that will speed up your workflow.
Switch Workspace: Ctrl + Tab (Ctrl + Tab in Windows)
Switch to Layers Panel: Cmd + Y (macOS only)
Switch to Symbol Library: Cmd + Shift + Y (macOS only)
Masking Layers
Mask objects by selecting any number of objects on the canvas and using the
keyboard shortcut Cmd + Shift + M (Ctrl + Shift + M in Windows). The object
highest in the object hierarchy (the object that appears on top of the others) will
be the mask, and any other layers will be masked underneath.
After this, the mask can be moved around independently as a single object,
although you can double-click the mask in the layer list to open it and make
changes to the masked objects.
Any styles associated with the mask will be voided.

Option/Alt
In Adobe XD, Option-Hold (Alt-Hold in Windows) has multiple uses depending
on the context in which it is used.
Hold Option or Alt…
After selecting an object to activate Smart Guides
After selecting a Control Point to move it asymmetrically
While drawing or resizing an object to draw/resize from the center of the
object, instead of from the mouse cursor
While dragging to copy and paste an object
Shift
Shift has even more uses than Option!
Hold Shift…
While moving a Control Point to allow only angle values that are 15°, or a
multiple of 15° (15°, 30°, 45°, 90°, 180°, etc)
While moving an Anchor Point to allow only angle values that are 15°, or a
multiple of 15° (15°, 30°, 45°, 90°, 180°, etc)
While drawing or resizing an object to draw/resize with the aspect ratio
maintained (also known as “constrain”) — add Shift to the mix to constrain
from the center of the object
While rotating objects to rotate angles by multiples of 15° only
While rotating lines to rotate angles by multiples of 45° only
