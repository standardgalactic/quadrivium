§1-3-2 Relationships Between Propositions

Relations between Formulas
For many applications of logic, we want to know about the
relationships between propositions.
▶Arguments from premises to conclusion.
▶Linguistic analysis.
▶Digital electronic circuits.
We start here with relationships between single propositions.

Logical Consequence
Formula B is a logical consequence of formula A
exactly when for all truth valuations in which A is
true, B is also true.
We will write this as A |= B.

Logical Consequence
Formula B is a logical consequence of formula A
exactly when for all truth valuations in which A is
true, B is also true.
We will write this as A |= B.
This can also be read as: A logically entails B,
or A logically implies B. It requires a
truth-transferring directed connection from A to B.

Example: Logical Consequence
A logically entails B means that for every row in a truth table in
which A gets the value 1, B must also get the value 1 on that row.

A logically entails B means that for every row in a truth table in
which A gets the value 1, B must also get the value 1 on that row.

Logical Equivalence
Formula A is logically equivalent to a formula B
exactly when for all truth valuations, A and B eval-
uate with the same truth value.
We will write this as A =||= B.

Logical Equivalence
We’ve already discussed some logical equivalences. For example:
A ∨B
=||=
∼(∼A & ∼B)
A & B
=||=
∼(∼A ∨∼B)
A ⊃B
=||=
∼(A & ∼B)
A ⊃B
=||=
∼A ∨B

Logical Consequence, Logical Equivalence and Tautologies
Theorem: For any propositional formulas A, B:
▶A =||= B if and only if
A |= B and B |= A.
▶A |= B
if and only if
(A ⊃B) is a tautology.
▶A =||= B if and only if
(A ≡B) is a tautology.

Exercise: Logical Consequence and Logical Equivalence
Suppose A and B are propositional formulas containing atoms p, q
and r, and their truth tables are as follows:

None of the above.

Contradictories
Formulas A and B are contradictories
exactly when for all truth valuations, A and B
evaluate with the opposite truth value.

Contradictories
Formulas A and B are contradictories
exactly when for all truth valuations, A and B
evaluate with the opposite truth value.
This requires B to be false whenever A is true, and
B to be true whenever A is false.

Contradictories
Formulas A and B are contradictories
exactly when for all truth valuations, A and B
evaluate with the opposite truth value.
This requires B to be false whenever A is true, and
B to be true whenever A is false.
Question: How do we express when two formulas are
contradictories in terms of the notions of logical
equivalence and logical consequence?

Contradictories
Theorem: For any propositional formulas A, B:
A and B are contradictories
if and only if
A =||= ∼B
if and only if
A ≡∼B is a tautology.

Traditional Logical Relations
Formulas A and B are contraries when they cannot
both be true: B is false whenever A is true, and A
is false whenever B is true.
Formulas A and B are sub-contraries when they
cannot both be false: B is true whenever A is false,
and A is true whenever B is false.
Question: How can we express these relationships using
logical consequence?

Contraries and Sub-contraries
Theorem: For any propositional formulas A, B:
A and B are contraries
if and only if
A |= ∼B
if and only if
A ⊃∼B is a tautology.
A and B are sub-contraries
if and only if
∼A |= B
if and only if
∼A ⊃B is a tautology.
