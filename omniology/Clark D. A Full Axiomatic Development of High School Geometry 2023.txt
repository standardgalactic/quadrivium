Preface
This textbook is written for those who seek a full understanding of the topics
that form the standard content of high school Euclidean geometry. After
giving a complete axiomatic development of those topics, it concludes with
a proof of the consistency of the axioms used and a full description of their
models. It is given in guided inquiry (inquiry-based) format with the intention
that students will prove the theorems and present their proofs to their class
with the instructor as a mentor and a guide.
The book is written for graduate and advanced undergraduate students
interested in teaching secondary school mathematics, for pure math majors
interested in learning about the foundations of geometry and for college and
university faculty preparing future secondary school teachers. Because the
presentation is fully self contained, it is suitable for self-study by advanced
math students and professional mathematicians. It constitutes the top tier of
a sequence of four educational tiers of geometry, beginning at the preschool
level. We oﬀer it with the hope that it will help to bring that sequence together
into a coordinated and integrated whole.
At the ﬁrst tier, young children gain experiences with round objects, like
balls, wheels, marbles and oranges. They also get experience with rectilinear
objects like building blocks, books and houses and linear objects like sticks
and strings. Soon words for abstract shapes and forms, like “circle”, “square”
and “line”, help to solidify those categories. Eventually those words get pre-
cise deﬁnitions as they discover that some words have an exact meaning that
everyone can understand.
The second tier is high school, where geometry becomes a real subject of
its own. There students are given an assortment of facts of geometry, some-
times called axioms, sometimes postulates and sometimes theorems, that they
are free to use. Their task is to understand these facts and the associated def-
initions and then use them to solve problems and establish other facts. Com-
pleting these tasks requires making logical arguments, orally or in writing,
and learning to justify those arguments.

Preface
Everyone needs to be able to reason from evidence, to draw valid conclu-
sions and to justify those conclusions to others on a regular basis. A func-
tioning democracy requires voting citizens who can make sound judgements
about the validity of the arguments they hear. In short, we all have a stake
in having these thinking, reasoning and communicating skills passed down in
our schools to the next generation. Teachers of all subjects at all levels have
an opportunity to help do this, and many do so very well.
But there is one place in the standard high school curriculum that of-
fers an opportunity to put a particularly direct focus on these skills. That is
Euclidean geometry. Solving problems by applying deﬁnitions and given in-
formation allows geometry students to draw conclusions that they can justify
and defend with a kind of authority that in no way depends on their age,
gender, race or socio-economic status. It empowers them with skills that can
be invoked in any pursuit that they might subsequently follow.
At the third tier teachers need to get preparation to convey these beneﬁts
to high school students. Normally this must come from a one semester un-
dergraduate geometry course. In order that they can teach the high school
geometry course their students will need, it is our view that a college geom-
etry course for teachers should fulﬁll three goals.
Structure: Mathematical Proof. A college level study of a subject is not
just about what is true in that particular subject, but also about how truth
is established in that subject. In the context of geometry, this means that
teachers need to understand the source and genesis of the facts they will be
giving their own students. As in all of mathematics, these facts are established
by means of a mathematical proof.
Pedagogy: Guided Inquiry. A geometry course for pre-service teachers
should oﬀer them a direct experience with the kind of active learning peda-
gogy we would like them to use later with their own students. At the college
level, this means that they will solve the problems, prove the theorems, and
present their results to their classmates with the instructor as a mentor and
a guide.
Content: High School Geometry. Geometry is a beautiful subject oﬀering
a vast array of interesting topics that could be studied. Pre-service teachers
need a course that treats exactly those topics that they will need to teach
in the schools. In spite of the many variations we have seen in high school
geometry, that list of topics has remained remarkably stable over time.
Most college level geometry courses have a focus on mathematical proof.
But many are still not using a guided inquiry (inquiry-based or active learn-
ing) pedagogy. Yet there is now an extensive body of research demonstrating
the beneﬁts of active learning. This is particularly applicable to the learning
of mathematical proof. Students cannot learn to prove theorems by watching
someone else prove theorems any more than they can learn to play the piano
by listening to someone else play the piano. Similarly few college level geom-
etry courses focus exclusively on the topics that are taught in high school.

Preface
ix
There are many other interesting topics of geometry that can be valid com-
ponents of a college level course. But it is our view that future high school
teachers need ﬁrst and foremost, in the one geometry course they are likely
to have, to gain a deep understanding of exactly those topics they will need
to teach.
In order to prove the important facts of high school geometry with a
guided inquiry format in a single undergraduate semester, it is important to
look closely at the nature of mathematical proof that is appropriate in this
context. It is simply unfeasible to prove every detail using a set of rudimentary
axioms like those used by David Hilbert [8]. Not only is it unfeasible. It is
not what future teachers are ready for at this stage. What they need is a
course that takes a relaxed view of unstated assumptions, as was always used
in teaching Euclid’s geometry. They then need to be given selected major
theorems of geometry as axioms, and then to prove consequences of those
axioms. This format will match the teaching they will need to do, but will
involve more theorem proving and less problem solving.
We are aware of only one third tier undergraduate geometry text that
achieves all three of these goals. That is Clark’s Euclidean Geometry: A
Guided Inquiry Approach [2]. That book looks at a plane as a set of points
with length, area and angle measures as primitive constructs governed by
axioms listing each of their properties. Five other axioms give properties of
congruence, parallels and similarity. Students then prove the other impor-
tant facts of geometry using these axioms and a limited range of unstated
assumptions.
It is our view that, in order to secure the reliability and credibility of K-12
geometry, this enterprise needs to maintain within its academic leadership a
critical number who have a full and complete understanding of the subject.
By this we mean that they fully understand the source and genesis of the con-
tent of K-12 geometry with no unstated assumptions or other logical gaps or
compromises. It was with this conviction that we set out to write this book,
oﬀering a fourth tier textbook for serious students of mathematics wanting to
focus on K-12 education. To do this we look at a plane as a set of points with
a distance function on pairs of points as its only primitive construct. Simple
axioms in Chapter 1 are used to prove the commonly unstated assumptions
of plane geometry. From there the notions of length, area and angle measure,
along with congruence and similarity, are carefully deﬁned and their proper-
ties proven as theorems. For the beneﬁt of those familiar with [2], we have
added Appendix B where we list all of the mathematical and logical gaps in
[2] and outline where and how they have been ﬁlled in this text.
Using this book to ﬁll those gaps will require a good bit of mathematical
maturity. In contrast with [2] we are starting with simpler, more rudimen-
tary axioms and therefore need to do more work to get the same results. For
example, many geometry texts, and particularly high school texts, deﬁne seg-
ments as congruent if they have the same length measure, angles as congruent

x
Preface
if they have the same degree measure and triangles as congruent if they have
congruent sides and angles. But the notion of congruence should really apply
to all ﬁgures. Circles with the same radius should count as congruent just as
the copies of page x in two new copies of this book should count as congruent.
Following common best practice in modern geometry, we solve this prob-
lem by deﬁning ﬁgures to be congruent if there is an isometry taking one
onto the other. We deﬁne the degree measure of an angle to be the least
upper bound of an associated set of real numbers. As a result, the assertion
that angles are congruent if and only if they have the same degree measure
is a theorem that needs to be proven using these two very diﬀerent deﬁni-
tions. Our Section 5.3 is devoted exclusively to proving that one theorem.
Although this book is entirely self contained, a reasonable amount of math-
ematical background and experience will be called upon to work through it.
For those with less mathematical background we suggest considering the text
[2] as a more accessible alternative.
We have written this fourth tier book in order to directly anchor K-12
geometry in solid modern mathematics. Our hope is that it will serve as a
foundation of fundamental knowledge that will fortify the teaching of sec-
ondary and tertiary geometry with deep understanding and inspiration. But
this can only happen if mathematicians who are capable of engaging in math-
ematics at this level will lend their abilities to help elevate the quality of the
K-12 mathematics experience.

Chapter 1
Foundational Principles
This chapter begins our full axiomatic development of the part of plane Eu-
clidean geometry that has traditionally been taught in high school. We will
start with a set P of objects that we call points and a notion of distance
between those points. By a distance function on P we mean a function 𝑑
from ordered pairs of points into the non-negative real numbers such that
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐴) = 0 and 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑑(𝐵, 𝐴)
for all points 𝐴and 𝐵of P. We will investigate planes
P := ⟨P; 𝑑⟩
consisting of a set P of points and a distance function 𝑑on P.
Every physical surface can be modeled by this kind of a plane. Often it
is useful to model a plane with diﬀerent distance functions. For example,
the Earth can be modeled as a sphere, where each centimeter on the sphere
corresponds to the same number of kilometers on the surface. It can also be
modeled by a Mercator projection, where each centimeter alone a single lati-
tude line represents the same number of kilometers. But that number shrinks
rapidly as the latitude lines near the poles. In spite of that distortion, Mer-
cator projections have the advantage of describing a ﬂat geometry. Euclidean
geometry is the study of ﬂat geometries.
The constructs of points and distance are thought of as primitive or unde-
ﬁned constructs because they have no universal meaning. Instead, they are
deﬁned in each particular plane. In contrast, a deﬁned construct is a con-
struct that is deﬁned using these primitive constructs and previously deﬁned
constructs. For example, between, length, triangle and area will be among the
many constructs we will deﬁne in general. Deﬁned constructs gain meaning
in a particular plane as soon as we deﬁne the two primitive constructs in that
plane.
Statements of geometry using these constructs are only true or false in
a particular plane, where the terms they use have concrete meanings. Any

1 Foundational Principles
ﬁnite set of statements phrased using these constructs can be taken as a set
of axioms for a theory of geometry. By a model of a set of axioms we mean
a plane in which each of the axioms is a true statement. A theorem, lemma
or corollary of that theory is a further statement that is also true in every
model of those axioms.
In the preface of [2] the author explained that he would intentionally omit
mention of assumptions about non-triviality, betweenness and intersection in
order to cover the topics of high school geometry in a single undergraduate
course. He referred to these assumptions as Foundational Principles, and
expected that students would ﬁll them in based on their own experiences
with physical space as had always been done by students of Euclid. Testimony
from instructors using [2] has conﬁrmed that this expectation has been widely
realized. These Foundational Principles were ﬁrst systematically formulated
as axioms by David Hilbert [8] in his 1899 revision of Euclid’s geometry [4].
In Chapter 1 we will give seven Hilbert style axioms that will replace the
Foundational Principles and give two more axioms from [2]. In Chapter 3
we will add one ﬁnal axiom from [2]. All ten axioms are listed together in
Appendix A in the order they will be introduced. The introduction of each
axiom will reduce the range of models under consideration, allowing us to
say more about the models we most want to study. We will prove theorems
from these axioms, and then use those theorems to prove further theorems,
gradually building an ever deeper understanding of the properties of these
planes.
Chapters 1 through 7 of this book correspond exactly to the ﬁrst seven
chapters of [2], with the order slightly changed and the missing content added.
As a result our numbering of lemmas and theorems no longer matches that
of [2]. To clarify the correspondence we have added a parenthetic reference
to each item from [2]. For example, “[2] C98” after “Theorem 52” means
that Theorem 52 is Corollary 98 in [2]. Appendix C: Theorem Index gives a
full list of items from [2] with their corresponding item in the present text,
indicating where each fact from [2] is fully established.
1.1 Non-triviality and Betweenness
The following initial deﬁnitions and axioms illustrate a central rationale for
teaching geometry in high school. It gives students an opportunity to work in
a context where they can and need to say exactly what they mean and mean
exactly what they say. We will model this practice in this text. For example,
if we say “𝐴and 𝐵are two points”, we will have excluded the possibility that
they are the same point. But if we say “𝐴is a point and 𝐵is a point”, we
will not have excluded that possibility.
We now give our ﬁrst deﬁned construct. Point 𝐵is between points 𝐴and
𝐶if 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are three points and

1.1 Non-triviality and Betweenness
3
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐶) = 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) + 𝑑(𝐵, 𝐶).
We write [𝐴𝐵𝐶] to mean that 𝐵is between 𝐴and 𝐶. More generally, if 𝑛≥3
is a positive integer and 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ..., 𝐴𝑛are points, we will write
[𝐴1𝐴2...𝐴𝑛]
as an abbreviation for the conjunction of all statements [𝐴𝑖𝐴𝑗𝐴𝑘] where
𝑖< 𝑗< 𝑘. Using the deﬁned construct of betweenness, we can immediately
give a number of other key deﬁned constructs. If 𝐴and 𝐵are two points, then
the segment 𝐴𝐵, the ray −−→
𝐴𝐵and the line ←→
𝐴𝐵are all subsets of P deﬁned
as
𝐴𝐵:= {𝐴, 𝐵} ∪{𝐷∈P | [𝐴𝐷𝐵]}
−−→
𝐴𝐵:= {𝐴, 𝐵} ∪{𝐷∈P | [𝐴𝐷𝐵] or [𝐴𝐵𝐷]}
←→
𝐴𝐵:= {𝐴, 𝐵} ∪{𝐷∈P | [𝐷𝐴𝐵] or [𝐴𝐷𝐵] or [𝐴𝐵𝐷]}.
Points that lie on the same line are said to be collinear.
Using just these deﬁnitions see if you can prove that betweenness is sym-
metric.
Lemma 1 (SYM). If 𝐵is between 𝐴and 𝐶, then 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are three
collinear points and 𝐵is between 𝐶and 𝐴.
Our ﬁrst four axioms will serve to eliminate trivial models in which we are
likely to have limited interest.
Non-Triviality Axioms
(2PA) Two Point Axiom. Given two points, there is exactly one line
containing them.
(3PA) Three Point Axiom. There are at least three points that are
not collinear.

1 Foundational Principles
A model of these axioms must contain at least three points. In Figure 1.1
we illustrate a minimal model. Here P = {𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶} and the distance between
any two points is one. It follows that there are no betweenness relations, and
the three 2-element subsets of P are exactly the segments, the rays and the
lines. Not much can be proven from these two axioms alone, as anything that
follows from these axioms must be true in this model. While this Three Point
Model is not entirely trivial, it is not very interesting, and presses us to add
further axioms that will restrict our models to those that better represent
physical surfaces. Our ﬁrst two betweenness axioms capture basic properties
we would expect of any notion of betweenness.
Betweenness Axioms
(UNQ) Uniqueness. Of any three collinear points, exactly one is be-
tween the other two.
(INF) Inﬁnity. If 𝐵and 𝐷are two points, then there are points 𝐴, 𝐶
and 𝐸such that [𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸].
Note that repeated applications of the INF axiom will produce an unlim-
ited number of points on the line ←→
𝐵𝐷. The axiom UNQ is vacuously true
in the Three Point Model since this model does not contain three collinear
points. But the INF axiom fails completely in that model, eliminating it from
further consideration. However, all four axioms we have given hold in every
real Cartesian space R𝑛, where 𝑛is a positive integer greater than one. As
an application of UNQ and INF, you can establish an important property of
the distance function.
Lemma 2. If 𝐴, 𝐵∈P, then 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 0 if and only if 𝐴= 𝐵.
You can prove the next lemma by applying the deﬁnition of ray together
with SYM and UNQ. It will follow that the statement of this lemma is true in
every model of the axioms we have given. We will use “←−−
𝐴𝐵” as an alternative
name for −−→
𝐵𝐴.
Lemma 3. If 𝐴and 𝐵are two points, then
(i) ←−−
𝐴𝐵∪−−→
𝐴𝐵= ←→
𝐴𝐵and (ii) ←−−
𝐴𝐵∩−−→
𝐴𝐵= 𝐴𝐵.
You might like to try to ﬁnd a proof of the following similar looking lemma
before reading further. If [𝐴𝐵𝐶], we refer to ←−−
𝐴𝐵and −−→
𝐵𝐶as opposite rays.
Lemma X. If [𝐴𝐵𝐶] for three points 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶on line ℓ, then
(i) ←−−
𝐴𝐵∪−−→
𝐵𝐶= ℓand (ii) ←−−
𝐴𝐵∩−−→
𝐵𝐶= {𝐵}.

1.1 Non-triviality and Betweenness

If you cannot prove it now, you can come back to it when you have more
axioms.
Since we are interested in plane geometry, we will now add an axiom that
holds in the real coordinate plane R2 but fails in R𝑛for all 𝑛greater than
two. Let ℓbe a line and let 𝐴and 𝐶be points not on ℓ. We say that 𝐴and
𝐶are on the same side of ℓif no point of ℓis between them. (Figure 1.2.)
(PSA) Plane Separation Axiom. Let ℓbe a line and let 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶
be three points not lying on ℓ.
(i) If 𝐴and 𝐵are on the same side of ℓand 𝐵and 𝐶are on the same
side of ℓ, then 𝐴and 𝐶are on the same side of ℓ.
(ii) If 𝐴and 𝐵are not on the same side of ℓand 𝐵and 𝐶are not on
the same side of ℓ, then 𝐴and 𝐶are on the same side of ℓ.

Theorem 4. If ℓis a line, then being on the same side of ℓis an equivalence
relation on the set of points not on ℓthat has exactly two equivalence classes.
By a side of line ℓwe mean one of the two equivalence classes of this equiv-
alence relation. Thus, if 𝐸and 𝐹are not on ℓ, then they are either on the
same side of ℓor they are on opposites sides of ℓ. As a result ℓpartitions the
plane into three parts, itself and its two sides.
If 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are three non-collinear points, then the triangle △𝐴𝐵𝐶is
deﬁned as
△𝐴𝐵𝐶:= 𝐴𝐵∪𝐵𝐶∪𝐴𝐶.
The points 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are called the vertices of △𝐴𝐵𝐶and the segments
𝐴𝐵, 𝐵𝐶and 𝐴𝐶are called the sides of △𝐴𝐵𝐶.

Pasch’s Theorem 5. Let ℓbe a line that does not contain any of the vertices
of △𝐴𝐵𝐶. If ℓintersects one of the sides of △𝐴𝐵𝐶, then it intersects one
and only one of its other two sides.
Lemma 6. If point 𝐴is on a line ℓand point 𝐵is not on ℓ, then every point
of the ray −−→
𝐴𝐵other than 𝐴is on the 𝐵-side of ℓ.
The following theorem tell us more about how points are arranged on a
single line.
Theorem 7. Let 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶and 𝐷be points.
(i) (4Pt1). If [𝐴𝐵𝐶] and [𝐴𝐶𝐷], then [𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷].
(ii) (4Pt2). If [𝐴𝐵𝐶] and [𝐵𝐶𝐷], then [𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷].
(Both 4Pt1 and 4Pt2 concern only points on a single line. To prove them,
look at the sides of some second line that intersects this line.)
We have given special names to the two parts of Theorem 7 because they will
be used extensively in all that follows.
Corollary 8. If 𝐵is a point of the ray −−→
𝑂𝐴other than 𝑂, then −−→
𝑂𝐵= −−→

(i) ←−−
𝐴𝐵∩−−→

If 𝐴, 𝑂and 𝐵are three non-collinear points, then the angle ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵is
deﬁned as the union
∠𝐴𝑂𝐵:= −−→
𝑂𝐴∪−−→

of the rays −−→
𝑂𝐴and −−→
𝑂𝐵. If the two rays are clear from the context, we will
sometimes refer to this as ∠𝑂. The interior of the angle ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵is the set of
all points on the 𝐴-side of −−→
𝑂𝐵and on the 𝐵-side of −−→
𝑂𝐴.

1.2 Congruence and Length Measure

We next have another theorem that will be used suﬃciently often to give
it a special name.
Crossbar Theorem 11. If point 𝐷is in the interior of ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵, then ray −−→
𝑂𝐷
intersects 𝐴𝐵at a point between 𝐴and 𝐵.
(Consider Figure 1.4 where we have added points 𝐸and 𝐹as shown. Use
Pasch’s Theorem to conclude that ←→
𝑂𝐷intersects one of the other two sides
of △𝐴𝐸𝐵at some point 𝑋. Then use the information you have about sides of
lines to show that 𝑋is on −−→
𝑂𝐷and is between 𝐴and 𝐵.)

1.2 Congruence and Length Measure
An isometry of a plane P is a bijection 𝛼: P →P that takes each point 𝐴
to the point 𝐴𝛼in such a way that, for all 𝐴, 𝐵∈P,
𝑑(𝐴𝛼, 𝐵𝛼) = 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵).
Note that the composition of two isometries is an isometry, the identity bi-
jection, 𝐴↦→𝐴, is an isometry and the inverse of an isometry is an isometry.
Consequently the set of all isometries of P forms the group of its distance
preserving bijections under composition.
A subset of P is called a ﬁgure or region. Figures X and Y are congruent,
written
X  Y,

Fig. 1.5 Congruent ﬁgures X and Y. [2]
if there is an isometry that takes X onto Y. (See Figure 1.5.) If X and Z are
ﬁgures, then Z is a part of X if Z ⊆X. Let 𝛼be an isometry taking X onto
Y, and let Z be a part of X. Then the part of Y corresponding to Z is Z𝛼.
Since 𝛼is an isometry taking Z onto Z𝛼, we have Z  Z𝛼. We express this
fact by saying that
corresponding parts of congruent ﬁgures are congruent,
abbreviated as CPCFC. This observation is used at the beginning of [2] to
demonstrate that two ﬁgures are not congruent by exhibiting a part of one
that is not congruent to any part of the other.
Lemma 12. Every isometry 𝛼preserves betweenness, that is,
[𝐴𝐵𝐶] if and only if [𝐴𝛼𝐵𝛼𝐶𝛼]
for all points 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶.
The proof of Lemma 12 points to a general principle. Ultimately every deﬁned
construct, like betweenness, can be deﬁned in terms of points and distance
alone. Since an isometry is a bijection on points and preserves distance, we
should expect it to preserve every deﬁned construct in an appropriate sense
for that construct.
It turns out that our primary direct use of the distance function 𝑑is
to measure the lengths of segments. Our intent is to deﬁne the length of a
segment as the distance between its endpoints. Doing this requires that we
ﬁrst verify that its endpoints are uniquely determined, that is, 𝐴𝐵= 𝐶𝐷
implies {𝐴, 𝐵} = {𝐶, 𝐷}.
Lemma 13. If 𝐴and 𝐵are two points, then they are the only points of
segment 𝐴𝐵that are not between any other two points of 𝐴𝐵.
This lemma allows us to unambiguously deﬁne the endpoints of a segment
to be the two points of that segment not between two other points of that
segment. Also the distance between the endpoints of 𝐴𝐵is unambiguously
deﬁned since 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑑(𝐵, 𝐴). We can now deﬁne the length of 𝐴𝐵as the
distance between its endpoints:
L(𝐴𝐵) := 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵).

1.2 Congruence and Length Measure
9
By Lemma 2 the length measure function L is a function from the set of
all segments into the positive real numbers.
The deﬁnitions of betweenness and isometry can also be expressed in terms
of length measure. Point 𝐵is between points 𝐴and 𝐶if and only if 𝐴, 𝐵
and 𝐶are three points and
L(𝐴𝐶) = L(𝐴𝐵) + L(𝐵𝐶).
A bijection 𝛼of P is an isometry if and only if, for every segment 𝐴𝐵,
L(𝐴𝛼𝐵𝛼) = L(𝐴𝐵).
Our next axiom gives properties of length measure that relate it to the
number system, to congruence and to the sides of a triangle.
(LMA) Length Measure Axiom. The length measure function L has
the following properties.
(i) There are two points 𝑂and 𝐼such that L(𝑂𝐼) = 1.
(ii) Segments are congruent if and only if they have the same length.
(iii) L(𝐴𝐶) < L(𝐴𝐵)+L(𝐵𝐶) for any three non-collinear points 𝐴, 𝐵and
𝐶(the Triangle Inequality).
This is a modiﬁcation of Axiom 1 of [2] where the Triangle Inequality has
replaced Axiom 1(iii), now the deﬁnition of betweenness. This inequality is
not mentioned in [2], but follows easily from Corollary 98 of [2] by looking at
the altitude from base 𝐴𝐶to vertex 𝐵.
The often used Ruler Postulate of Birkhoﬀ[1] implies that, for every pos-
itive real number, there is a segment having that number as its length. (See
page 100.) Following [2] we do not use this postulate as it is not needed in
our development. Instead we use LMA(i), a very small fragment of the Ruler
Postulate. We will see in Chapter 8 that this choice results in a much richer
assortment of models of our geometry, including the coordinate planes of the
constructible numbers and of the algebraic numbers. We refer to the set of
all positive real numbers that are lengths of segments as F+. Thus
F+ := {L(𝐴𝐵) | 𝐴, 𝐵∈P with 𝐴≠𝐵} ⊆R+,
where R+ denotes the set of all positive real numbers. We note here that
readers do have the option to include the Ruler Postulate if they like. This
will mean that the number set F+ is necessarily all of R+. As a result all parts
of our development that concern which numbers are in F+ could be ignored.
This would include most of Chapter 8 where we exhibit a wide range of
models of our axioms that correspond to diﬀerent subsets F+ of R+.

1.3 Circles
In this section we will add two axioms about intersections. If 𝑂is a point
and 𝑟∈F+, then the set
C𝑂
𝑟:= {𝐵∈P | 𝑑(𝑂, 𝐵) = 𝑟}
is called a circle. The point 𝑂is the center of C and 𝑟is the radius of C. We
require the radius to be in F+ because, if it were not, the circle would be the
empty set. Our next axiom below will imply that this provision guarantees
that the circle is not the empty set. The name “C𝑂
𝑟” for a circle indicates
that 𝑂is its center and that 𝑟is its radius. Rather than naming the radius,
we will often specify a circle as “C𝑂
𝐵” to indicate that 𝐵is a point on it and
that its radius is therefore 𝑟= 𝑑(𝑂, 𝐵).
For each point 𝐵on circle C𝑂
𝑟, we say that the segment 𝑂𝐵is a radius
of C𝑂
𝑟. If 𝑂𝐴and 𝑂𝐵are radii and 𝑂is between 𝐴and 𝐵, then 𝐴𝐵is a
diameter of C𝑂
𝑟. By the deﬁnition of between all diameters have the same
length, namely 2𝑟. We call the number 2𝑟the diameter of circle C𝑂
𝑟. The
inside and outside of circle C𝑂
𝑟are deﬁned as
In(C𝑂
𝑟) = {𝑋∈P | 𝑑(𝑂, 𝑋) < 𝑟}
Out(C𝑂
𝑟) = {𝑌∈P | 𝑑(𝑂,𝑌) > 𝑟}.
Lemma 14. Let 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝑂be three points. Then
(i)
𝐵lies outside circle C𝑂
𝐴if [𝑂𝐴𝐵] and
(ii)
𝐵lies inside circle C𝑂
𝐴if [𝑂𝐵𝐴].
(RCA) Ray Circle Axiom. A circle intersects every ray emanating from
a point inside the circle.
Theorem 15. If a point of line ℓis inside a circle, then it is between two
points of ℓthat are on the circle.
Corollary 16. Every circle has a diameter.
Because no precise deﬁnition of congruent is given in [2], the only ﬁgures
that are ever provably congruent are triangles and parts of triangles. The
transformational deﬁnition of congruent using isometries opens the possibility
of proving other ﬁgures congruent.
Theorem 17. Two circles are congruent if and only if they have the same
radius.

1.4 Triangle Congruence
11
The RCA tells us something about how rays, and therefore also lines, will
intersect circles. We will need a second circle axiom that tells us how circles
intersect each other.
(CCA) Circle Circle Axiom. If a circle contains a point outside and a
point inside another circle, then the two circles intersect in exactly two points
which lie on opposite sides of the line containing their centers.
1.4 Triangle Congruence
Consider two triangles △𝐴𝐵𝐶and △𝑋𝑌𝑍. We will write
△𝐴𝐵𝐶 △𝑋𝑌𝑍
to mean that these triangles are congruent under an isometry 𝛼such that
𝐴𝛼= 𝑋, 𝐵𝛼= 𝑌and 𝐶𝛼= 𝑍. Conversely, if 𝛼is an isometry taking 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶
to 𝑋,𝑌, 𝑍, respectively, then (△𝐴𝐵𝐶) 𝛼= △𝑋𝑌𝑍by Lemma 12, and therefore
△𝐴𝐵𝐶 △𝑋𝑌𝑍.
A triangle has six parts: three angles and three sides. If two triangles are
congruent, then CPCFC tells us that their respective parts must be congruent
under the associated isometry. It is natural to ask if the converse is true.
Assume that we have two triangles △𝐴𝐵𝐶and △𝑋𝑌𝑍for which the three
corresponding sides and three corresponding angles are pairwise congruent:
𝐴𝐵 𝑋𝑌, 𝐵𝐶 𝑌𝑍, 𝐶𝐴 𝑍𝑋
∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∠𝑋𝑌𝑍, ∠𝐵𝐶𝐴 ∠𝑌𝑍𝑋, ∠𝐶𝐴𝐵 ∠𝑍𝑋𝑌.
Does it follow that the two triangles are congruent?
To answer this question aﬃrmatively would require ﬁnding an isometry of
the entire plane that takes △𝐴𝐵𝐶onto △𝑋𝑌𝑍. At this point we do not have
the means to do this. Instead we will take as an axiom the assertion that
the ﬁrst three of these conditions imply congruence. Using this axiom we will
eventually demonstrate that a number of diﬀerent other subsets of these six
congruences also imply that the triangles are congruent. In this section we
will prove the most important instance of this, the SAS axiom of [2].
(SSS) Side-Side-Side. If △𝐴𝐵𝐶and △𝑋𝑌𝑍are triangles with 𝐴𝐵 𝑋𝑌,
𝐴𝐶 𝑋𝑍and 𝐵𝐶 𝑌𝑍, then △𝐴𝐵𝐶 △𝑋𝑌𝑍.

Let 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶be collinear points with 𝐵between 𝐴and 𝐶, and let 𝐷be
a point not on the line containing 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶. Then the angles ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷and
∠𝐶𝐵𝐷are called supplementary angles. A right angle is an angle that
is congruent to one of its supplements. We say that two intersecting lines 𝑙
and 𝑚are perpendicular if they form a right angle at their intersection. An
equilateral triangle is a triangle whose three sides are pairwise congruent.
A trisquare is a triangle that has three right angles. (Figure 1.8.) Given a
segment 𝐴𝐵, we say that a point 𝑀between 𝐴and 𝐵is a midpoint of 𝐴𝐵
if 𝐴𝑀 𝑀𝐵. Ray −−−→
𝑂𝑀bisects ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵if 𝑀in in the interior of ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵and
∠𝐴𝑂𝑀 ∠𝑀𝑂𝐵.

Deﬁned terms like equilateral triangle, trisquare, midpoint and bisector
raise an obvious question:
Do these objects necessarily exist in the plane P?
Looking at how this question is answered in [2] oﬀers a nice illustration of
the beneﬁts of our work in this chapter.

14
1 Foundational Principles
Consider, for example, the question as to whether every segment 𝐴𝐵has a
midpoint. Students are typically asked to construct ﬁgures with a straightedge
and compass and then give a justiﬁcation for their construction. In this case,
Figure 1.9 illustrates such a construction. They draw the two circles C𝐵
𝐴and
C𝐵
𝐴intersecting at points 𝑋and 𝑌. Then they take 𝑀to be the intersection
of lines ←→
𝐴𝐵and ←→
𝑋𝑌. To establish that 𝑀is the midpoint of 𝐴𝐵, they observe
that △𝐴𝑋𝑌 △𝐵𝑋𝑌by SSS. Consequently ∠𝐴𝑋𝑌 ∠𝐵𝑋𝑌by CPCFC. Then
△𝐴𝑋𝑀 △𝐵𝑋𝑀by SAS, and therefore 𝐴𝑀 𝐵𝑀.
The problem with these kind of “proofs” is that constructions depend
heavily on intersections of lines, rays and circles as well as on betweenness
relations. However, at this level, intersections and betweenness are left to
students’ intuition according to the Foundational Principles of [2]. You can
now use the deﬁnitions, axioms and theorems you have to eliminate these
unstated assumptions. Start this by writing out a careful and detailed proof
of the following lemma.

You are now in a position to establish the existence of perpendiculars and
angle bisectors deﬁned at the beginning of this section.
Theorem 27 ([2] T34). There is a line perpendicular to any given line
through a given point on the line.
Theorem 28 ([2] T33). There is a line perpendicular to any given line
through a given point not on the line.
Theorem 29 ([2] T32). Every angle has a unique bisector.
Note that the foundation we have developed here allows us to add “unique”
to Theorems 29, 32 and 35 of [2], justifying references to the midpoint of a
segment and the bisector of an angle.
Problem 20 in [2] asks students to construct a triangle with sides congruent
to three given segments. Of course, those three segments were chosen so that
such a triangle could be constructed. This problem leads us to ask: For which
triples of segments does there exist a triangle with sides congruent to those
three segments? We now have the facts we need to answer this question.
Theorem 30. Let 𝑎, 𝑏and 𝑐be the lengths of three segments. Then there is
a triangle with sides of length 𝑎, 𝑏and 𝑐if and only if each of these numbers
is less than the sum of the other two.
(See Figure 1.11.)
It still remains to answer the question as to whether or not the plane
contains a trisquare.

Two lines are parallel if they have no point in common. It turns out that
many of the properties of a plane P that we would like to understand depend

(i) No parallels.

q𝑃
(ii) One parallel.

(iii) ∞parallels.
Fig. 2.1 Existence of parallels.
The answer will depend on what plane we have. It is conceivable that all pairs
of lines would bend toward each other and eventually intersect, as shown in
Figure 2.1(i). Or there might be a plane in which all lines bend away from each
other, as shown in Figure 2.1(iii), resulting in inﬁnitely many lines through
𝑃parallel to ℓ. We will not study either of these alternative planes in this
book, but only mention that there is ample literature written about both.
In the next chapter we will add one ﬁnal axiom that says that the answer
is always “exactly one line”, as shown in Figure 2.1(ii). In the meantime, we
will see in this chapter that there are many important facts about geometry
that can be proven without any assumption about the number of parallels
through a point 𝑃. As you prove these theorems, pay close attention to places
where you need to know which points are between which other points, which

lines and circles intersect and which side of a line you are on. The facts proven
in Chapter 1 will help you through this.
We begin by looking at a special kind of triangle. A triangle is isosceles
if two of its sides are congruent segments. The angles opposite the congruent
sides of an isosceles triangle are called the base angles.
Theorem 31 ([2] T36). The base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent
angles.
Theorem 32 ([2] T37). Congruent angles have congruent supplements.
Assume that 𝑋is a point between 𝐴and 𝐶, that 𝑋is also between 𝐵and
𝐷, and that these points are not all collinear. Then the angles ∠𝐴𝑋𝐵and
∠𝐶𝑋𝐷are called vertical angles.
Theorem 33 ([2] C38). Vertical angles are congruent.
Weak Right Angle Theorem 34 ([2] T39). An angle that is congruent to
a right angle is also a right angle.
If [𝐴𝐵𝐶], then L(𝐴𝐶) = L(𝐴𝐵) + L(𝐵𝐶). It follows that L(𝐴𝐶) > L(𝐴𝐵)
and consequently 𝐴𝐶is not congruent to 𝐴𝐵by LMA(ii). Axiom 4 of [2] says
that a similar fact is true about angles. We can now prove this axiom as a
theorem using the Triangle Inequality, LMA(iii).
Theorem 35 ([2] Axiom 4). If point 𝐵is in the interior of ∠𝐴𝑂𝐶, then
∠𝐴𝑂𝐶is not congruent to ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵.
(Suppose these angles are congruent. Choose 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶to lie on a circle C𝑂
with center 𝑂. Show that 𝐵and 𝐶lie on a circle C𝐴with center 𝐴, and then
show that these two circles violate the CCA as shown in Figure 2.2.)

We can at last settle the matter of the trisquares.
Theorem 36 ([2] T47). A triangle has at most one right angle. In particular,
there are no trisquares.
Figure 2.1(i) suggests correctly that surfaces with uniform positive curvature,
like a sphere, can contain trisquares.
Assume that a line ℓintersects two lines 𝑚and 𝑛at two diﬀerent points.
The line ℓis called a transversal to 𝑚and 𝑛. The angles in Figure 2.3
marked ⋄and ∗are called corresponding angles and the angles marked ◦
and ∗are called alternate interior angles.

sponding angles that are congruent, then the two lines are parallel.

Given △𝐴𝐵𝐶and point 𝐷such that 𝐶is between 𝐴and 𝐷, the angle
∠𝐵𝐶𝐷is called an exterior angle of △𝐴𝐵𝐶. Angles ∠𝐴and ∠𝐵are called
the opposite interior angles to ∠𝐵𝐶𝐷. (Figure 2.4.)
Weak Exterior Angle Theorem 40 ([2] T43). An exterior angle of a tri-
angle is not congruent to either opposite interior angle.
Theorem 41 ([2] T44 ASA). If two angles and the side between them in one
triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and side between them
in another triangle, then the triangles themselves are congruent.
Theorem 42 ([2] T45 AAS). If two angles and a side not between them
in one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and side not
between them in another triangle, then the triangles themselves are congruent.
Theorem 43 ([2] T46). If two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the
opposite sides are congruent.
If one of the angles of a triangle is a right angle, the triangle is called a right
triangle. The two sides adjacent to the right angle are called the legs of the
right triangle. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse of
the right triangle. Theorem 36 assures us that a right triangle has only one
hypotenuse.
Theorem 44 ([2] T48 HL). If a leg and the hypotenuse of one right triangle
are congruent to the corresponding leg and the hypotenuse of another right
triangle, then the two right triangles are congruent.
Strong Right Angle Theorem 45 ([2] T49). All right angles are congru-
ent. Thus a right angle is congruent to another angle if and only if the other
angle is also a right angle (Figure 2.5).

Corollary 47 ([2] C51 HA). If the hypotenuse and a non-right angle of one

A tangent to the circle C is a line that contains exactly one point of C.

perpendicular to ℓ.

In the sixth century BCE the Greek mathematician and philosopher
Pythagoras of Samos recorded a theorem that has remained central to plane
Euclidean geometry to this day. It can be a valuable exercise for high school
students to investigate the many known proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem. This
theorem is unusual in the sense that new insights into geometry often lead
to new proofs of this theorem.
We will present three diﬀerent versions of this theorem with ﬁve diﬀerent
proofs. Each will reﬂect what can be done with the tools available at that

be used to prove the full version at the end of Chapter 3. In Chapter 3 we
will also give a historically signiﬁcant version that dates back to early Greece.
Chapters 4 and Chapter 5 will each end with a proof of the full version that
utilizes what we will have learned in that chapter.
1st Pythagorean Theorem 52 ([2] C98). The hypotenuse of a right trian-
gle is longer than either of its legs.
We can rephrase this theorem by saying that, given a point 𝑃and a line ℓ
not containing 𝑃, the perpendicular segment from 𝑃to ℓis shorter than any
other segment connecting 𝑃to a point on ℓ(Figure 2.7).

The problem with this deﬁnition is that it requires that we ﬁrst show that
there is such a point 𝑥𝑃on −−→
𝑂𝑃. To resolve this problem we will start in a
diﬀerent place. We say that a positive real number 𝑥is a scaling factor if,
for any two points 𝑂and 𝑃, there is a (necessarily unique) point 𝑥𝑃on ray
−−→
𝑂𝑃such that
𝑑(𝑂, 𝑥𝑃) = 𝑥𝑑(𝑂, 𝑃).

with center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥. We will say two ﬁgures X and Y are

In order to make use of this concept, we need to determine which positive
real numbers 𝑥are scaling factors. For example, if we deﬁne 1𝑃:= 𝑃, then we
have 𝑑(𝑂, 1𝑃) = 1𝑑(𝑂, 𝑃) for all points 𝑂and 𝑃. Thus 1 is a scaling factor.
If 𝑥is a scaling factor, then we can choose 𝐼so that 𝑂𝐼is a unit interval and
conclude that
𝑑(𝑂, 𝑥𝐼) = 𝑥𝑑(𝑂, 𝐼) = 𝑥1 = 𝑥.
Consequently every scaling factor 𝑥must be in the set F+ of lengths of seg-
ments. In Section 3.2 we will prove the Scaling Lemma 69 saying that F+
is exactly the set of all scaling factors. In order to do this we will need to
start with a point 𝑂and 𝑥∈F+. Then, for each point 𝑃, we will need to
specify a choice of a point 𝑥𝑃in −−→
𝑂𝑃, as we did with 𝑥= 1, and prove that
𝑑(𝑂, 𝑥𝑃) = 𝑥𝑑(𝑂, 𝑃).
A dilation with center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥magniﬁes or reduces the
distance of each point from 𝑂by a factor of 𝑥. In Section 3.3 we will prove the
Scaling Theorem 78 which says that the same dilation magniﬁes or reduces
the distance between every two points by a factor of 𝑥. In Section 3.4 we will
show that similarity of triangles has two very nice additional characterizations
by proving the Similar Triangles Theorem 88.
3.1 The Euclidean Parallel Axiom
In order to prove the Scaling Lemma 69 and Scaling Theorem 78 we will need
to add one last axiom and investigate its consequences. This axiom builds

3.1 The Euclidean Parallel Axiom

on the Weak Parallel Line Corollary 39 to say that parallel lines behave as
illustrated in Figure 2.1(ii).
(EUC) Euclidean Parallel Axiom. For every line ℓand every point 𝑃not
on ℓ, there is at most one line containing 𝑃that is parallel to ℓ.
Corollary 53 ([2] C59). Two lines parallel to the same line are parallel to
each other.
Strong Alternate Interior Angle Theorem 54 ([2] T60). Assume that a
transversal line intersects two lines. Then the two lines are parallel if and only
if the alternate interior angles are congruent.
Corollary 55 ([2] C61). Assume a transversal line intersects two lines. Then
the two lines are parallel if and only if the corresponding angles are congruent.
If 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶and 𝐷are four points and the four segments 𝐴𝐵, 𝐵𝐶, 𝐶𝐷and
𝐷𝐴have no points of intersection other than those four points, then the
union of those four segments is called a quadrilateral and is denoted by
□𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷. We say the segments 𝐴𝐵and 𝐶𝐷are parallel if the lines ←→
𝐴𝐵and
←→
𝐶𝐷are parallel. A quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides that are parallel
is called a trapezoid. A parallelogram is a trapezoid in which both pairs
of opposite sides are parallel. A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which each
angle is a right angle. A rhombus is a quadrilateral in which all four sides
are congruent.
Lemma 56. Every rectangle is a parallelogram.
Theorem 57 ([2] T72). Each pair of opposite sides of a parallelogram are
congruent.
Corollary 58 ([2] C62). Opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent.
By the distance from a point 𝑃to a line ℓnot containing 𝑃, we mean the
length L(𝑃𝑄) where 𝑄is the unique point of ℓfor which ←→
𝑃𝑄is perpendicular
to ℓ. From Theorem 52 we know that 𝑃𝑄is the shortest segment connecting
𝑃to a point on ℓ.
Theorem 59 ([2] T63). Assume that ℓand 𝑚are two parallel lines. Then
all points on 𝑚are the same distance from ℓ.
If 𝑚and ℓare parallel lines, then Theorem 59 allows us to deﬁne the distance
between 𝑚and ℓto be the distance from any point of one of these lines to
the other line.

Corollary 61. Given two segments, there exists a rectangle with one pair of

A square is a rectangle that is also a rhombus, i.e., a quadrilateral with

Theorem 62 ([2] T65). Given two points 𝐴and 𝐷, there are points 𝐵and
𝐶such that □𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷is a square.
A unit square is a square, each of whose sides has length one. It follows from
Theorem 62 that unit squares exist. They will provide a unit of measure for
calculating areas.

3.2 The Scaling Lemma
In this section we will show that every number in F+ is a scaling factor. Let
𝑂be a ﬁxed point. We will start by identifying, for each 𝑥∈F+ and each
point 𝑃, a point we will call 𝑥𝑃. Our goal will be to prove that 𝑃↦→𝑥𝑃is a
dilation with center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥.
We begin by taking 𝑥𝑂:= 𝑂. For 𝑃≠𝑂let 𝐼be either one of the two points
on the line through 𝑂perpendicular to ←→
𝑂𝑃at distance one from 𝑂. Let 𝑥𝐼
denote the unique point on −→
𝑂𝐼at distance 𝑥from 𝑂. By Theorems 26 and 35
there exists a unique ray −−−−→
𝑥𝐼𝑀on the 𝑃-side of ←→
𝑂𝐼so that ∠𝑂𝑥𝐼𝑀 ∠𝑂𝐼𝑃.

positive reals R+. We denote by Z+ the set of positive integers and Q+ the set
of positive rational numbers. Thus
Z+ ⊆Q+ ⊆R+.

do this we will use a fundamental principle that connects these three sets.

(i) The set F+ is closed under addition, that is, 𝑥+ 𝑦∈F+ whenever 𝑥

(ii) Q+ ⊆F+
(iii) Q+ is dense in F+, that is, between any two numbers in F+ there is a

A function 𝑓: F+ →F+ is called an endomorphism of the semigroup F+

𝑓(𝑥+ 𝑦) = 𝑓(𝑥) + 𝑓(𝑦) for all 𝑥, 𝑦∈F+.
Note that if 𝑓is an endomorphism, 𝑥∈F+ and 𝑛∈Z+, then 𝑥𝑛= 𝑥+𝑥+· · ·+𝑥∈

Fig. 3.8 Scaling factor 𝑥= 2 on diﬀerent surfaces.
To appreciate the signiﬁcance of the Scaling Theorem 78 it is helpful to
think about the geometry of diﬀerent surfaces represented by diﬀerent planes.
Figure 3.8(i) shows how a dilation by 𝑥= 2 of a segment 𝐴𝐵on a sphere
will produce a segment of length less that twice the length of the original
segment. There are other surfaces represented by hyperbolic planes where
radiating lines tend to bend away from each other as shown in Figure 3.8(iii).
In these cases this dilation of a segment has length greater than twice the
length of the original segment. The Scaling Theorem 78 will demonstrate that
the Euclidean Parallel Axiom (EUC) precludes surfaces like those shown in
parts (i) and (iii) of Figures 2.1 and 3.8.
Our ﬁrst step is to show that the Scaling Theorem is true in the special
case that the two points are collinear with 𝑂.
Lemma 71. Let 𝑥𝐴and 𝑥𝐵be the images of two points 𝐴and 𝐵under the
dilation with center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥. If 𝑂∈←→
𝐴𝐵, then 𝑑(𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵) =
𝑥𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵).
It remains to prove the Scaling Theorem for points 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝑂that are
not collinear. Since 2 ∈F+, it is a scaling factor by the Scaling Lemma. We
start with this simplest case in which the scaling factor is 2. The proofs for
all other scaling factors will be progressive extensions of this proof. Since this
context is focused on triangles, it is more natural to think in terms of length
measure L instead of distance measure 𝑑.

Lemma 72 ([2] T112). If 𝐴, 𝑂and 𝐵are not collinear, then

2𝐴2𝐵is parallel to ←→

L( 𝑚

𝑛𝐴) for every choice of 𝑛. Now show that L( 𝑚
𝑛𝐴𝑚+1
𝑛𝐴) = 1
𝑛L(𝑂𝐴).
This gives you a contradiction if you choose 𝑛large enough so that 1
𝑛L(𝑂𝐴) <
L(𝐶𝑥𝐴).)
Lemma 77. Let 𝐴, 𝑂and 𝐵be non-collinear points and let 𝑥and 𝑦be scaling
factors for dilations centered at 𝑂. Then 𝑥< 𝑦if and only if L(𝑥𝐴𝑥𝐵) <
L(𝑦𝐴𝑦𝐵).
(Use Lemma 76.)
We can now extend Lemma 75(i) to all scaling factors in F+.
Scaling Theorem 78 ([2] p57). If 𝐴and 𝐵are two points and 𝑥∈F+ is the
scaling factor for a dilation, then L(𝑥𝐴𝑥𝐵) = 𝑥L(𝐴𝐵).
(The number 𝑦:= L(𝑥𝐴𝑥𝐵)/L(𝐴𝐵) tells us how many times larger or smaller
L(𝑥𝐴𝑥𝐵) is than L(𝐴𝐵). You would like to prove that 𝑦is 𝑥. Do this by
showing that a rational number 𝑞is less that 𝑦if and only it it is less than 𝑥.
Then apply Lemma 66(iii).)
The Scaling Theorem 78 has many useful consequences. The ﬁrst we give
is Axiom 8 of [2], which we can now prove.

Theorem 79 ([2] Axiom 8). Let 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶be three points and let 𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵
and 𝑥𝐶be their images under a dilation with center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥.
(i) If 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are collinear, then 𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵and 𝑥𝐶are collinear.
(ii) If 𝐵is between 𝐴and 𝐶, then 𝑥𝐵is between 𝑥𝐴and 𝑥𝐶.
Corollary 80 ([2] T110). Let ℓbe a line and let ℓ′ be the image of ℓunder
a dilation. Then either ℓ′ = ℓor ℓ′ is a line parallel to ℓ.
Corollary 81 ([2] T111). Dilations preserve angle congruence. Speciﬁcally,
if non-collinear points 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶go to non-collinear points 𝑥𝐴, 𝑥𝐵and 𝑥𝐶
under a dilation with scaling factor 𝑥, then
∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∠𝑥𝐴𝑥𝐵𝑥𝐶.
3.4 Similarity
Recall that ﬁgures are similar if one is congruent to the image of the other
under some dilation. As we now know a great deal about congruence, our
primary challenge to showing that two ﬁgures X and Z are similar is that
of ﬁnding the right scaling factor. Assume the Y is congruent to Z and Y is
the image of X under a dilation with scaling factor 𝑦. The Scaling Theorem
suggests a way to determine the value of 𝑦. Suppose we measure the distance
between two points of X and get a value 𝑥. Then we measure the distance
between the corresponding two points of Z and get a value 𝑧. Since Y is
congruent to Z, the corresponding measurement on Y would also have to

34

be 𝑧. The Scaling Theorem says that 𝑧must then be 𝑥𝑦. Consequently 𝑦
must be 𝑧/𝑥.
For example, suppose we would like to verify that the left ﬁgure X in
Figure 3.12 is similar to the right ﬁgure Z. We might measure the distance
between the earrings in both ﬁgures and get 𝑥= 5 and 𝑧= 4. To obtain a
dilation Y of X that is congruent to Z, we would need to use the scaling factor
𝑦:= 𝑧
𝑥= 4
5 = 0.8.
In general, since 𝑥and 𝑧are length measurements, they are both in F+. By
the 2nd F+ Lemma 70 we are guaranteed that 𝑧/𝑥is in F+ and is therefore
a scaling factor. We will use this technique to ﬁnd scaling factors for the
dilations we need.

Corollary 82 ([2] P109). Any two segments are similar.
Corollary 83 ([2] P106). Any two circles are similar.
As applications of the Scaling Theorem we will give two other criteria
for triangles to be similar, neither of which refer to an isometry or a dila-
tion. We say that two sequences of numbers 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . and 𝑎′, 𝑏′, 𝑐′, . . . are
proportional if there is a number 𝑥such that
𝑎′
𝑎= 𝑏′
𝑏= 𝑐′

Lemma 84 ([2] T116). If △𝐴𝐵𝐶∼△𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′, then corresponding angles are
congruent and corresponding sides are proportional by the scaling factor of
the dilation that was used.
Theorem 85 ([2] T118). If a triangle with sides of lengths 𝑎, 𝑏and 𝑐is
similar to a triangle with corresponding sides of length 𝑎′, 𝑏′ and 𝑐′, then
corresponding pairs of sides are in the same ratio:

𝑏′ = 𝑎
𝑏,

𝑐′ = 𝑎

We would like to prove two converses for Lemma 84: that congruence of
corresponding angles and proportionality of corresponding sides each imply
that two triangles are similar. Since proving similarity requires ﬁnding the
right scaling factor, we will again need to use the closure of F+ under division
(2nd F+ Lemma 70).
Proportional Sides Lemma 86 ([2] T120). If the corresponding sides of
two triangles are proportional, then the triangles are similar.
Lemma 87 ([2] T123 AAA). If the corresponding angles of two triangles are
congruent, then the triangles are similar.
Combining Lemmas 84, 86 and 87 gives us a full characterization of similar
triangles.
Similar Triangles Theorem 88 ([2] T128). For triangles T and T′, the fol-
lowing are equivalent; that is, each one implies the other two.
(i) T is similar to T′.
(ii) Each angle of T is congruent to the corresponding angle of T′.
(iii) The sides of T are proportional to the sides of T′.
Theorem 89 ([2] C126 AA). If two angles of one triangle are congruent to
two corresponding angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.

Chapter 4
Area Measure
An area measure function A can be introduced either as another primitive
construct or as a deﬁned construct. The text [2] takes A as a primitive
construct governed by an axiom similar to our Area Measure Theorem 120
at the beginning of Section 4.4. This amounts to a shortcut that is available
to our readers as well. By assuming the existence of an area measure function
A with the properties listed in Theorem 120, it is possible to go directly from
the deﬁnition of polygonal region on page 38 to Section 4.5 and calculate the
polygonal areas as is done in Chapter 3 of [2]. It is also possible to omit most
of our Section 7.1.
The price for taking this shortcut is that when the time comes to apply
the theorems we prove here to a particular plane, as we do in Chapter 8,
it will then be necessary to demonstrate the existence of an area measure
function A satisfying the conditions of Theorem 120 in each of those planes.
In order to oﬀer a full axiomatic development of this geometry, we will forego
this shortcut.
In Section 4.1 of this chapter we will identify a set of ﬁgures in the plane
P, called polygonal regions, whose areas we would initially like to deﬁne. In
Section 4.2 we will present the historic forerunner of area measure used by the
early Greeks. In Section 4.3 we will present the deﬁnition of an area measure
function on all polygonal regions. Our starting point for this deﬁnition is our
Lemma 102, which uses the Similar Triangles Theorem 88 to deﬁne triangular
area. It is for this reason that we present similarity before area measure. In
Section 4.4 we will prove the Area Measure Theorem 120 holds under this
deﬁnition of area. In Section 4.5 we will use Theorem 120 to establish the
standard area formulas for familiar quadrilaterals.
In Chapter 7 we will continue the topic of area measure. Section 7.1 is
primarily devoted to a proof of Theorem 199, which we will use to consider-
ably expand the class of regions whose areas we can compute. The work in
this section is largely topological in nature, but our presentation is fully self
contained.

4 Area Measure
4.1 Polygonal Regions
Recall that “ﬁgure” or “region” refers to any set of points. In this section
we will identify the regions F whose areas we will calculate in this chapter
and examine their relevant properties. We begin by looking at parts and
characteristics of regions in general. By an open disc we mean the inside
of some circle. Let F be an arbitrary region. The boundary of F is the set
F𝑏of all points 𝑃in F such that every open disc containing 𝑃intersects the
complement of F. The interior of F is the set F𝑖of all points that are in an
open disc entirely contained in F. Thus every region F is the disjoint union
F = F𝑏∪F𝑖
of its boundary and its interior.
Triangles will play a central role in area measure. The inside of a triangle
is the intersection of the interiors of its angles. A triangular region is the
union of a triangle and its inside. A triangulation of a region is a ﬁnite set of
triangular regions with pairwise disjoint interiors whose union is that region.
A polygonal region is a region F that has a triangulation. (See Figure 4.1).
In this chapter we will deﬁne and calculate areas of polygonal regions.

Fig. 4.1 A triangulation of a polygonal region F.
To do this we will start by deﬁning a particular class of familiar ﬁgures
which we will prove to be polygonal regions and which have boundaries and
interiors that are easily identiﬁed. Let 𝑛≥3 be an integer. A ﬁgure X is called
a convex 𝑛-gon if there is a sequence of 𝑛points 𝑃0, 𝑃1, . . . , 𝑃𝑛−1 (called the
vertices of X) forming 𝑛segments 𝑃0𝑃1, 𝑃1𝑃2, . . . , 𝑃𝑛−2𝑃𝑛−1, 𝑃𝑛−1𝑃0 (called
the sides of X) such that, if 𝐴𝐵is a side, then the 𝑛−2 vertices other than
𝐴and 𝐵are on the same side of ←→
𝐴𝐵and
X := 𝑃0𝑃1 ∪𝑃1𝑃2 ∪. . . 𝑃𝑛−2𝑃𝑛−1 ∪𝑃𝑛−1𝑃0.
The 𝑛angles ∠𝑃𝑖𝑃𝑖+1𝑃𝑖+2 for 𝑖< 𝑛−2, together with ∠𝑃𝑛−2𝑃𝑛−1𝑃0 and
∠𝑃𝑛−1𝑃0𝑃1, are called the angles of X. We write

4.1 Polygonal Regions
39
X := 7𝑃0𝑃1𝑃2 . . . 𝑃𝑛−1
if X forms a convex 𝑛-gon when the vertices are listed in this order. A ﬁgure
is a convex polygon if it is a convex 𝑛-gon for some 𝑛≥3. For example, a
ﬁgure is a triangle if and only if it is a convex 3-gon. Every parallelogram is
a convex 4-gon.
In this context the term convex has a very general meaning that we will
also need. A region F is convex if it has the property that
𝐴, 𝐶∈F and [𝐴𝐵𝐶] implies 𝐵∈F.
For example, it is straightforward to prove from facts in Section 1.1 that
many regions we have discussed are convex.
Lemma 94. Every line, each side of a line and each segment is convex.
However, convex polygons are not convex in this sense. We call them convex
polygons because, as we will soon establish, they serve to enclose a region
that is convex.
Relative to a convex polygon X with side 𝐴𝐵, we call the side of ←→
𝐴𝐵
containing the other vertices the inside of ←→
𝐴𝐵and the other side of ←→
𝐴𝐵the
outside of ←→
𝐴𝐵. The inside of X, denoted by In(X), is the intersection of the
insides of all the sides of X. Equivalently, it is the intersection of the interiors
of the angles of X. We refer to the set
X := X ∪In(X)
as a convex polygonal region. Note that this is a disjoint union because
no point of In(X) can be on a side of X.
Convex polygonal regions prove to be very useful, in part because we can
show that they have interiors and boundaries that are easily recognized. To
do this we need a lemma giving a basic property of open discs that we will
need here and will make extensive use of in Chapter 7.
Lemma 95. If the point 𝑃is in the open disc D1, then there is an open disc
D2 ⊆D1 centered at 𝑃.
Theorem 96. Let X be a convex polygon.
(i) X
𝑖= In(X) : the interior of X is the inside of X.
(ii) X
𝑏= X : the boundary of X is X.
Our goal in the remainder of this section is to justify our terminology by
proving that convex polygonal regions are indeed both convex regions and
polygonal regions.
Lemma 97. Every convex polygonal region X is a convex region.

To prove that a convex polygonal region X = 7𝑃0𝑃1𝑃2 . . . 𝑃𝑛−1 is a polyg-
onal region we will prove that the diagonal segments from 𝑃0 to each of the

4.2 Decompositional Equivalence
Before we discuss area measure, it is helpful to digress brieﬂy to look at the
forerunner of this concept that is best illustrated by the original history of
the Pythagorean Theorem. The fact is that our Pythagorean Theorem 92, as
we have stated it, was of little interest to the early Greeks. The problem was
that the only numbers available at that time were the rational numbers. The
Pythagoreans knew, for example, that the only positive integers 𝑎and 𝑏for
which 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 was the square of a (rational) number were those rare cases
where it was the square of an integer. In all other cases the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with legs of length 𝑎and 𝑏had no numerical length that they
knew of, so Theorem 92 simply did not apply.
Around 300 BCE Euclid of Alexandria assembled plane geometry into a
single axiomatic development for the ﬁrst time [4]. His proof of Pythagoras’
theorem used the additivity property of angle measure that we will prove in
Chapter 5. However, he avoided numerical measurement of areas by using a
restricted notion of area equivalence to state and prove Pythagoras’ theorem

42
4 Area Measure
without reference to numbers. We will now present a variant of Euclid’s proof
that illustrates this technique and avoids mention of either area measure or
angle measure.
We say that polygonal regions F and G are decompositionally equiva-
lent, written F 𝑑𝑒∼G, if there is a positive integer 𝑛and sets {F1, F2, . . . , F𝑛}
and {G1, G2, . . . , G𝑛} of polygonal regions with disjoint interiors so that
1. F = F1 ∪F2 ∪· · · ∪F𝑛,
2. G = G1 ∪G2 ∪· · · ∪G𝑛and
3. F𝑖 G𝑖for 𝑖= 1, 2, . . . , 𝑛.

3rd Pythagorean Theorem 101. Given a right triangle, the squares upon
its two legs are together decompositionally equivalent to the square upon its
hypotenuse.
(Let △𝐴𝐵𝐶be a right triangle with right angle at 𝐶, let X, Y and Z be
the square regions on the outside of each of the sides of △𝐴𝐵𝐶as shown in
Figure 4.5. Then the line perpendicular to ←→
𝐴𝐵through 𝐶divides Z into two
rectangular regions U and V. Show that X 𝑑𝑒∼U and Y 𝑑𝑒∼V.)
Euclid’s proof of this theorem is similar to ours but draws on his own
tools. Our proof above is possible here because it uses neither an area measure
function nor an angle measure function. At the end of this chapter we will use
area measure to obtain a diﬀerent proof of the Pythagorean Theorem 92 as
an immediate consequence of Theorem 101 (the Pythagorean Theorem 126).
4.3 Polygonal Area
In this section we will deﬁne an area measure function A on polygonal regions.
Ideally we would like to deﬁne the area of a polygonal region as the sum of
the areas of its component triangular regions, where we deﬁne the area of a
triangular region as half of its base times height. Doing this presents us with
two immediate tasks. First we need to establish that calculating base times
height gives the same value for all three choices of the base and height. Then
we need to show that summing the areas of triangulations gives the same
value for all possible triangulations. The ﬁrst is an immediate consequence
of the Similar Triangles Theorem 88.
Lemma 102. For a triangle △𝑋𝑌𝑍, the value of 𝑏ℎ/2 is the same for each
of the three choices of a base 𝑏and corresponding height ℎ.

Following standard terminology, the area of a triangle T is the area of the
triangular region T.
The second task will require examining a series of progressively more gen-
eral cases.
Lemma 103. If △𝐴𝐵𝐶is a triangle with point 𝑃between 𝐵and 𝐶, then
A(△𝐴𝐵𝐶) = A(△𝐴𝐵𝑃) + A(△𝑃𝐵𝐶).

Lemma 105. If Q = □𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷is a convex quadrilateral, then
A(△𝐴𝐵𝐶) + A(△𝐴𝐷𝐶) = A(△𝐵𝐴𝐷) + A(△𝐵𝐶𝐷).
(In Figure 4.7 we have on the left and right two diﬀerent triangulations of the
same polygonal region. Prove that they have the same area sum by showing
that the central triangulation must have the same area sum as each of them.)
We will use this same technique in the rest of this section, applying it
next to convex polygonal regions and then to all polygonal regions. Using
Lemma 105 we can unambiguously deﬁne the area of a convex quadrilat-
eral region Q as the sum of the areas of the two triangular regions produced
by either of its diagonals. The area of a convex quadrilateral Q is the
area of that convex quadrilateral region Q.
Our next goal will be to ﬁnd a way to extend Lemma 105 to all convex
polygonal regions.
Lemma 106. Let △𝐴𝐵𝐶be a triangle with points 𝑆and 𝑅such that [𝐴𝑆𝐵]
and [𝐵𝑅𝐶]. Then
A(△𝐴𝐵𝐶) = A(□𝐴𝑆𝑅𝐶) + A(△𝑆𝐵𝑅).

By a half plane of a line ℓwe mean the union of ℓand one of the sides
of ℓ. If 𝐴is a point not on ℓ, then we denote by H(ℓ, 𝐴) the half plane of
ℓcontaining 𝐴. In this terminology we can describe the triangular region
determined by a triangle △𝐴𝐵𝐶as
△𝐴𝐵𝐶= H(←→
𝐴𝐵, 𝐶) ∩H(←→
𝐵𝐶, 𝐴) ∩H(←→
𝐶𝐴, 𝐵).
Lemma 108. Let X be a convex polygon and let ℓbe a line containing a point
𝑄inside X with half planes H1 and H2. Then X1 := H1 ∩X and X2 := H2 ∩X
are convex polygonal regions with disjoint interiors such that X = X1 ∪X2.

4.3 Polygonal Area

Lemma 110. Let X be a convex polygonal region, let 𝑆∈X and let T𝑆be the
set of triangular regions formed by connecting 𝑆to each (other) vertex of X.
Then T𝑆is a triangulation of X.
(See Figure 4.11.)
If 𝑆∈X, we will call the triangulation T𝑆described in Lemma 110 a leaf
triangulation of X. Building on Lemma 106 we would like to extend the
notion of a triangulation to employ other convex polygonal regions as well.
Accordingly we say that a polyation of a region is a ﬁnite set of convex polyg-
onal regions with pairwise disjoint interiors whose union is that region. If we
happen to ﬁnd that a polyation P consists only of triangular and quadrilat-
eral regions, then we can deﬁne its area sum, denoted by ΣP, as the sum of
the areas of those component regions. The next lemma will confront us with
just such a polyation. This lemma is a direct extension of Lemma 105 from
convex quadrilaterals with diagonal triangulations to all convex polygonal
regions and all leaf triangulations.

Fig. 4.12 Two leaf triangulations of a convex polygonal region.
Lemma 111. All leaf triangulations of a convex polygonal region have the
same area sum.
(Referring to Figure 4.12, consider two leaf triangulations radiating from
points 𝑅and 𝑆on a convex polygon X. Show that the two triangulations
together form a polyation of X whose convex polygonal regions are all trian-
gular or quadrilateral. Then show that both area sums are the same as the
area sum of that polyation.)
Using Lemma 111 we can unambiguously deﬁne the area of a convex
polygonal region X as the area sum of its leaf triangulations. The area of
a convex polygon X is the area of the convex polygonal region X.

4 Area Measure
We will now extend the deﬁnition of area to all polygonal regions in several
steps.
Lemma 112. Let X be a convex polygonal region that is divided into two
convex polygonal regions X1 and X2 by a line ℓ. Then
A(X) = A(X1) + A(X2).
Consider now a polyation W of a polygonal region F and any line ℓ. (Fig-
ure 4.13.) We deﬁne a new polyation W[ℓ] of F as follows. If ℓdoes not
contain a point in the interior of any region of W, take W[ℓ] := W. Other-
wise, for each convex polygonal region Y of W containing a point of ℓin its
interior, apply Lemmas 108 and 112 to replace Y with two convex polygonal
regions with disjoint interiors whose union is Y and whose area sums added
together give the area of Y. As a result, it will follow that ΣW[ℓ] = ΣW.
We refer to W[ℓ] as the line reﬁnement of polyation W by the line ℓ.

Lemma 113. A line reﬁnement of a polyation W of a polygonal region has
the same area sum as W.
Theorem 114. All polyations of a polygonal region F have the same area
sum. In particular all triangulations of F have that same area sum.
(Let P and Q be any two polyations of F. Find a ﬁnite list: ℓ0, ℓ1, . . . , ℓ𝑚−1
of lines and sequences U0, U1, U2, . . . and V0, V1, V2, . . . of new polyations
of F with the following properties.
1. U0 = P and V0 = Q.
2. For 𝑖= 0, 1, . . . , 𝑚−1 we have U𝑖+1 = U𝑖[ℓ𝑖] and V𝑖+1 = V𝑖[ℓ𝑖].
3. U𝑚= V𝑚.
It will follow that ΣP = ΣQ.)
Using Theorem 114 we can now unambiguously deﬁne the area measure
function A.

4.4 The Area Measure Theorem
49
For each polygonal region F we deﬁne A(F), the area of F, to be
the area sum of every triangulation of F.
Note that this deﬁnition is consistent with our previous deﬁnitions of area for
triangular regions, convex quadrilateral regions and convex polygonal regions.
4.4 The Area Measure Theorem
Having deﬁned the function A, will will now prove the Area Measure Theo-
rem 120 saying that A has the basic properties we would expect of any area
measure function. These are parts (i), (ii) and (iii) of the Area Measure Ax-
iom of [2]. Section 7.1 will be primarily devoted to a proof of Theorem 199,
which is part (iv) of that axiom.

Next we would like to prove that isometries preserve area. Isometries were
deﬁned to be bijections that preserve distance. Since the distance function 𝑑is
our only primitive construct, every other construct has been deﬁned in terms
of 𝑑and previous constructs. As a result it is a totally routine matter to verify
that each of these other constructs is also preserved in an appropriate sense
by isometries. The following theorem articulates exactly what this means for
a number of key constructs.
Theorem 116. Isometries preserve length, betweenness, segments, rays, lines,
sides of lines, angles, bisectors of angles, right angles and circles, More specif-
ically, if 𝛼is an isometry, 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶are distinct points, then
(i) L(𝐴𝐵) = L(𝐴𝛼𝐵𝛼),
(ii) [𝐴𝐵𝐶] if and only if [𝐴𝛼𝐵𝛼𝐶𝛼],
(iii) (𝐴𝐵) 𝛼= 𝐴𝛼𝐵𝛼,

(ix) If ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵is a right angle, then ∠𝐴𝛼𝑂𝛼𝐵𝛼is a right angle.
(x) If C is a circle with center 𝑂and radius 𝑟, then C𝛼is the circle with
center 𝑂𝛼and radius 𝑟.
Lemma 117. Congruent polygonal regions have the same area.
(Let F and G be polygonal regions and let 𝜑be an isometry that takes F
onto G. Show that 𝜑maps a set of triangular regions with disjoint interiors
whose union is F onto a set of triangular regions with disjoint interiors whose
union is G. Further, show that those two sets of triangular regions have the
same area sum.)
The caveat in Theorem 120(iii), that F and G overlap only along their
boundaries, immediately implies that their interiors are disjoint. In fact the
converse is true as well.
Lemma 118. Two polygonal regions have disjoint interiors if and only if
their intersection is contained in both of their boundaries. In symbols,
F𝑖∩G𝑖= ∅if and only if F ∩G ⊆F𝑏∩G𝑏
for all polygonal regions F and G.

(Assume F ∩G ⊈F𝑏∩G𝑏. You need to show that F𝑖∩G𝑖≠∅. Note that the

51
F ∩G = (F𝑏∪F𝑖) ∩(G𝑏∪G𝑖)
= (F𝑏∩G𝑏) ∪(F𝑏∩G𝑖) ∪(F𝑖∩G𝑏) ∪(F𝑖∩G𝑖).
Since F ∩G ⊈F𝑏∩G𝑏, it remains to show that, if either F𝑏∩G𝑖≠∅or
F𝑖∩G𝑏≠∅, then F𝑖∩G𝑖≠∅. Assume F𝑏∩G𝑖≠∅contains the point 𝑃.
(Figure 4.15). Using these facts, locate a point 𝑄in F𝑏∩G𝑖.)
In practice we ﬁnd that it is often easier to exhibit a line separating the
interiors of F and G than to prove that their intersection is contained in their
boundaries.
Lemma 119. If the polygonal regions F and G have disjoint interiors, then
F ∪G is a polygonal region and
A(F ∪G) = A(F) + A(G).
We can now gather these lemmas into our ﬁnal theorem.
Area Measure Theorem 120 ([2] Axiom 6). The area measure function A
has the following properties.
(i) The area of the unit square is 1.
(ii) Congruent polygonal regions have the same area.
(iii) If the polygonal regions F and G have disjoint interiors, then F ∪G is
a polygonal region and A(F ∪G) = A(F) + A(G).
4.5 Consequences of Area Measure
We end this chapter by using our deﬁnition of area to prove some of the
standard area formulas from high school. If 𝑏and 𝑏′ are the lengths of two
parallel sides of a trapezoid T and ℎis the distance between them given by
Theorem 59, then we call 𝑏and 𝑏′ bases for T and ℎthe corresponding
height of T.
Theorem 121 ([2] T74). If 𝑏and 𝑏′ are bases for a trapezoid T and ℎis
the corresponding height, then
A(T) = (𝑏+𝑏′)ℎ

.
If P is a parallelogram, 𝑏is the length of a side of P and ℎis the distance
between that side and the side parallel to it, then we call 𝑏a base of P and
ℎthe corresponding height of P.
Theorem 122 ([2] T73). If 𝑏is a base of a parallelogram P and ℎis the
corresponding height, then
A(P) = 𝑏ℎ.

triangular regions with disjoint interiors.

As a consequence of the Area Measure Theorem 120 we see that, for two
polygonal regions, decompositional equivalence is indeed a special case of
equal area just as congruence is a special case of decompositional equivalence.
Theorem 125. Two polygonal regions that are decompositionally equivalent
have the same area.
You can now obtain the full Pythagorean Theorem 92 as an immediate
consequence of Pythagorean Theorem 101, the Rectangle Area Theorem 123
and Theorem 125.
4th Pythagorean Theorem 126. If a right triangle has legs of lengths 𝑎

Chapter 5
Angle Measure
Like area measure, angle measure is a construct that can either be primitive
or deﬁned. Elementary treatments, as given in [2], take the degree measure
function D as a primitive construct governed by an axiom asserting that
it has properties similar to those of length and area measure. This option
provides an eﬃcient shortcut to proving further properties of angle measure
and their consequences. But it obligates us to deﬁne a measure function D
and prove that the axiom holds for D in each model before we can conclude
that the theorems are true in that model.
Our treatment of angle measure contrasts with the three widely used ax-
iomatic developments of plane Euclidean geometry given in [7], [10] and [11].
All three use the Ruler Postulate and treat hyperbolic geometry as well. All
three treat length and polygonal area much as we do. But they do less with
angle and circle measure.
•
Hartshorne [7] takes distance as the only primitive construct, making only
minor references to angle measure, and shows that the real coordinate
plane R2 is a model of his axioms.
•
Millman and Parker [10] take distance, lines and angle measure as primi-
tive constructs and show that R2 is the only model of their axioms. As we
describe in Chapter 8, they use diﬀerences and inner products of points
in R2 together with the inverse cosine function to deﬁne angle measure
in R2.
•
Moise [11] takes distance and angle measure as primitive constructs gov-
erned by axioms. He then presents R2 as a candidate for a model, but
refrains from deﬁning angle measure in R2 with the claim (page 439)
that doing so is a “formidable technical chore”. This makes it diﬃcult to
know which of his theorems do not depend on the angle measure axioms
on pages 95 and 96 and are therefore true in R2.
Our title set a clear goal that required us to include a full axiomatic
treatment of angle measure. It would have been an option to follow Millman
and Parker, giving degree measure as a primitive construct governed by our

5 Angle Measure
Angle Measure Theorem 164 stated as an axiom. We could have then shown
in Chapter 8 that angle measure could be deﬁned in each model as they do.
However, our intention was also to develop geometry from distance measure
alone, deﬁning all other constructs by drawing on concepts familiar to high
school teachers and their students without making an exception for angle
measure.
Our deﬁnition of the degree measure D in Section 5.2 draws on the method
of [2] that allows students to approximate the measure of any given angle
∠𝐵𝑂𝐴. This method is illustrated in Figure 5.1. It begins by constructing a
perpendicular ray from 𝑂on the 𝐵-side of ←→
𝑂𝐴, forming two 90 degree angles.
Bisecting these two angles produces four 45 degree angles. Bisecting those
produces eight 22.5 degree angles, and so forth. The result is to construct a
protractor that they can use to measure ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴by locating −−→
𝑂𝐵between two
of these binary rays. The more binary rays they produce, the more accurately
they can estimate the measure of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴.

Fig. 5.1 Approximating the measure of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴. [2]
.
We began our study of area measure with the weaker notion of same area
that was obtained by decompositional equivalence. Similarly, we will begin
our study of angle measure in Section 5.1 with the weaker notion of angle
ordering that says when one angle is less than another. Our deﬁnition of
degree measure D in Section 5.2 is a formalization of the method shown in
Figure 5.1. In Sections 5.3 and 5.4 we will prove that D fulﬁlls the conditions
listed in our Angle Measure Theorem 164.

5.1 Ordering Angles
55
There is just one particularly involved part of the proof of the Angle Mea-
sure Theorem 164. Notice that the three parts of that theorem are very close
analogs of the ﬁrst three parts of the Length Measure Axiom (LMA) and to
the Area Measure Theorem 120 with one exception. Part (ii) of Theorem 120
says only that two congruent polygonal regions have the same measure. Part
(ii) of Theorem 164 says that two angles are congruent if and only if they have
the same measure. It turns out that the added assertion in Theorem 164(ii),
that
angles with the same measure are congruent,
will take a serious eﬀort to prove. We have therefore allocated Section 5.3
entirely to the proof of Theorem 164(ii).
In Section 5.4 we will complete the proof of the Angle Measure Theo-
rem 164 and we give its standard consequences in Section 5.5. This will
include a ﬁnal proof of the Pythagorean Theorem 175 that uses both area
measure and angle measure.
5.1 Ordering Angles
In this section we will apply the method of ordering angles from small to
large as a ﬁrst step toward deﬁning a degree measure on angles in the next
section.
Lemma 127. If ∠𝐴𝑂𝐶is an angle and point 𝐵lies on line ←→
𝐴𝐶, then 𝐵is
interior to ∠𝐴𝑂𝐶if and only if [𝐴𝐵𝐶].
We will write “(𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂” to mean that point 𝐵is in the interior of angle
∠𝐴𝑂𝐶. Intuitively we can think of the statement “(𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂” as saying that
ray −−→
𝑂𝐵is between the rays −−→
𝑂𝐴and −−→
𝑂𝐶. More generally, if ∠𝐴𝑚−1𝑂𝐴0 is an
angle, we will write
“(𝐴𝑚−1𝐴𝑚−2𝐴𝑚−3 . . . 𝐴1𝐴0)𝑂”
to mean that (𝐴𝑘𝐴𝑗𝐴𝑖)𝑂for all integers 𝑘, 𝑗, 𝑖such that 0 ≤𝑖< 𝑗< 𝑘< 𝑚.
It turns out that the ternary relation (. . . )𝑂has a property that is a direct
analog of the betweenness property 4Pt1.
Lemma 128. If (𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂and (𝐴𝐶𝐷)𝑂, then (𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷)𝑂.
Notice that the analog of the other four point property 4Pt2 is clearly false:
(𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂and (𝐵𝐶𝐷)𝑂do not imply (𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷)𝑂.
We would like to say that ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′ is less than ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵, written
∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′ < ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵

56
5 Angle Measure
(or ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵> ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′), if there is a point 𝑋such that (𝐴𝑋𝐵)𝑂and ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′ 
∠𝐴𝑂𝑋. However, this deﬁnition is potentially ambiguous since it does not
explain which of the two rays −−→
𝑂𝐴or −−→
𝑂𝐵is to be combined with −−→
𝑂𝑋to match
∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′. It turns out that this is not a problem. The following lemma shows
that angle order is indeed well deﬁned by showing that there is an 𝑋for which
(𝐴𝑋𝐵)𝑂and ∠𝐴𝑂𝑋 ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′ if and only if there is a 𝑌for which (𝐴𝑌𝐵)𝑂
and ∠𝐵𝑂𝑌 ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′.
Lemma 129. Let 𝑋be a point in the interior of ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵. Then there is a
point 𝑌in the interior of ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵such that ∠𝐴𝑂𝑋 ∠𝐵𝑂𝑌.
Theorem 130. If 𝑂is a point, then the relation (...)𝑂is preserved by isome-
tries. In symbols, let 𝐴, 𝑂, 𝐵be non-collinear points, let 𝑋be a point and let
𝛼be an isometry. Then
(𝐴𝑋𝐵)𝑂if and only if (𝐴𝛼𝑋𝛼𝐵𝛼)𝑂𝛼.
Lemma 131. If ∠𝐴, ∠𝐵and ∠𝐶are angles, then
(i) ∠𝐴≮∠𝐴,
(ii) ∠𝐴< ∠𝐵< ∠𝐶implies ∠𝐴< ∠𝐶,
(iii) ∠𝐴< ∠𝐵 ∠𝐶implies ∠𝐴< ∠𝐶
∠𝐴> ∠𝐵 ∠𝐶implies ∠𝐴> ∠𝐶and
(iv) exactly one of ∠𝐴< ∠𝐵or ∠𝐴 ∠𝐵or ∠𝐴> ∠𝐵is true.
Theorem 132. Isometries preserve angle order. In symbols, let ∠𝐴and ∠𝐵
be angles and let and 𝛼be an isometry. Then
∠𝐴< ∠𝐵if and only if (∠𝐴) 𝛼< (∠𝐵) 𝛼.
We can now give a reﬁnement of Theorem 40, which said that no angle of
a triangle is congruent to an opposite exterior angle.
Theorem 133. Each angle of a triangle is less than each opposite exterior
angle.
Lemma 134. Let 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶be three collinear points. If 𝐵∈−−→
𝐴𝐶and L(𝐴𝐵) <
L(𝐴𝐶), then [𝐴𝐵𝐶].
Theorem 135. In a triangle, the larger side is opposite the larger angle and
the larger angle is opposite the larger side.
Theorem 136. Let 𝐴and 𝐵be two points on a circle C with center 𝑂and
radius 𝑟, and let 𝑋be a third point of line ←→
𝐴𝐵. Then 𝑋is inside C if it is
between 𝐴and 𝐵and is outside C otherwise.

5.2 Degree Measure
57
5.2 Degree Measure
Building on the facts we have established about ordering of angles, we will
describe a way to assign a number between 0 and 180 to each angle that we
will call its degree measure. To do this we begin by ﬁxing an arbitrary angle
∠𝐵𝑂𝐴and using binary rays close to −−→
𝑂𝐵to deﬁne its degree measure.
Lemma 137. Let 𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦and 𝑃𝑧be points of a circle C with center 𝑂such
that 𝑃𝑥and 𝑃𝑧are not collinear with 𝑂. If (𝑃𝑥𝑃𝑦𝑃𝑧)𝑂, then neither 𝑃𝑥and
𝑃𝑦nor 𝑃𝑧and 𝑃𝑦are collinear with 𝑂.

Fig. 5.2 Binary points X3 from X2.
Now consider the ﬁxed angle ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴and let C be any ﬁxed circle with
center 𝑂. We use the letter “N” to denote the natural numbers:
N := {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }.
We will recursively deﬁne a nested sequence
X1 ⊆X2 ⊆X3 ⊆X4 . . .

58
5 Angle Measure
of subsets of C as follows. Let 𝑃0 be the intersection of −−→
𝑂𝐴with C and let 𝑃1
be the point of C on the 𝐵-side of ←→
𝑂𝐴such that ←−→
𝑂𝑃1 is perpendicular to ←−→
𝑂𝑃0.
(See Figure 5.2.) Choose 𝑃2 and 𝑃3 on C so that [𝑃2𝑂𝑃0] and [𝑃1𝑂𝑃3]. From
here onward, if 𝑥is a number and we deﬁne a point 𝑃𝑥, we will understand
“𝑃𝑥+4” to be an alternate name for 𝑃𝑥. We now deﬁne
X1 := {𝑃0, 𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3} = {𝑃𝑖/21−1 | 21+1 > 𝑖∈N}.
Note that if 𝑖∈N, then ∠𝑃𝑖+1𝑂𝑃𝑖is a right angle so that 𝑃𝑖and 𝑃𝑖+1 are not
collinear with 𝑂.
Assume 0 < 𝑛∈N and that we have deﬁned the subset
X𝑛:= {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 2𝑛+1 > 𝑖∈N}
of C so that 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 and 𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1 are not collinear with 𝑂for any 𝑖∈N. Let
X𝑛+1 := {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛| 2𝑛+2 > 𝑖∈N}
where 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛is deﬁned in two cases. If 𝑖= 2𝑗is even, then
𝑃𝑖/2𝑛= 𝑃2 𝑗/2𝑛= 𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1 ∈X𝑛
is already deﬁned. If 𝑖= 2𝑗+ 1 is odd, we use the fact that 𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1 and
𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1 are not collinear with 𝑂to deﬁne 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛= 𝑃(2 𝑗+1)/2𝑛to be the
bisector of
∠𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1 = ∠𝑃(2 𝑗+2)/2𝑛𝑂𝑃2 𝑗/2𝑛= ∠𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛𝑂𝑃(𝑖−1)/2𝑛.
If 𝑖∈N, then Lemma 137 tells us that neither 𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛and 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛nor 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛
and 𝑃(𝑖−1)/2𝑛are collinear with 𝑂.
We can now deﬁne the set
X := {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 𝑛−1, 𝑖∈N},
the union of all of the sets X𝑛with 𝑛−1 ∈N. We refer to the points of X as
the binary points of C, as these points correspond to the rational numbers
𝑥∈[0, 4) which have a ﬁnite decimal representation when written base two.
Lemma 138 ([2] T83). Assume that ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∠𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′. Let −−→
𝐵𝐷bisect ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶
and −−−→
𝐵′𝐷′ bisect ∠𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′. Then ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷 ∠𝐴′𝐵′𝐷′.
Theorem 139. Given the angle ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴, the circle C with center 𝑂and its
associated binary points X deﬁned above, we have, for all 𝑖, 𝑗and 𝑛with
𝑛−1, 𝑖, 𝑗∈N,
△𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1  △𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1.
In particular,

5.2 Degree Measure
59
∠𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1  ∠𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1
and
L(𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1) = L(𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1).
Looking at Figure 5.2 we would like to deﬁne degree measure in such a way
that the measure of ∠𝑃1𝑂𝑃0 is 90, the measure of ∠𝑃3/4𝑂𝑃0 is 90 × 3
4 = 67 1
2
and the measure of ∠𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃0 is 90𝑖/2𝑛−1 for every binary point 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1
with 𝑖/2𝑛−1 < 2. More generally, we would like to deﬁne the degree measure
of the arbitrary angle ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴= ∠𝐵𝑂𝑃0 in such a way that, for 0 < 𝑖< 2𝑛, the
degree measure of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴is more than 90𝑖/2𝑛−1 if and only if 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 is in the
interior of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴. Figure 5.2 suggests that we deﬁne the degree measure of
∠𝐵𝑂𝐴as 90 times the least upper bound of the set of 𝑖/2𝑛−1 such that 𝑖< 2𝑛
and 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 is in the interior of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴; in symbols,
D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) := 90 lub

𝑖
2𝑛−1
 𝑛−1 ∈N, 𝑖< 2𝑛and (𝐵𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 𝐴)𝑂
	
.
For example, Figure 5.1 suggests that the degree measure of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴is some-
where between 90 × 18
16 = 101 1
4 and 90 × 19
16 = 106 7
8.
As was the case with the deﬁnition of ordering of angles, we need to es-
tablish that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choices we must make
to apply it. To measure ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴there are two choices we need to make. First
we need to choose a circle C with center 𝑂. Secondly, we need to choose
whether to take 𝑃0 on −−→
𝑂𝐴, thereby measuring ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴, or to take 𝑃0 on −−→
𝑂𝐵,
thereby measuring ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵. We need to establish that neither of these choices
will change the value of the degree measure.
Lemma 140. Assume C and C′ are two circles centered at 𝑂. Take 𝑃0 and
𝑃1 to be points on C such that ∠𝑃1𝑂𝑃0 is a right angle and let X = {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 |
𝑖, 𝑛−1 ∈N} ⊆C be the resulting set of binary points. For 𝑘= 0, 1 let 𝑃′
𝑘be
the intersection of −−−→
𝑂𝑃𝑘with C′ and let X′ = {𝑃′
𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 𝑖, 𝑛−1 ∈N} ⊆C′ be
the set of binary points obtained by starting with 𝑃′
0 and 𝑃′
1. Then, for each
positive integer 𝑛, we have
−−−−−−−→
𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 = −−−−−−−→
𝑂𝑃′
𝑖/2𝑛−1
for all 𝑖∈N.
Lemma 141. The value of D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) is independent of the choice of circle
C centered at 𝑂that is used to calculate it.
Lemma 142. Let C be a circle with center 𝑂and binary points
X = {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 𝑖, 𝑛−1 ∈N}
and let 𝛼be an isometry. Let

with points 𝑃′

0 and 𝑃′
1 := 𝑃𝛼

1𝑂𝛼𝑃′
0.
Then, for all 𝑗, 𝑛−1 ∈N, we have
𝑃′
𝑗/2𝑛−1 = 𝑃𝛼
𝑗/2𝑛−1.
Lemma 143. Let ∠𝑂be an angle that is the union of two rays −−→
𝑂𝐴and −−→
𝑂𝐵.
Then the value of the degree measure of angle ∠𝑂is the same whether we
calculate it using
(i) 𝑃0 on −−→
𝑂𝐴and 𝑃1 on the 𝐵-side of ←→
𝑂𝐴to obtain D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) or
(ii) 𝑃0 on −−→
𝑂𝐵and 𝑃1 on the 𝐴-side of ←→
𝑂𝐵to obtain D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵).
Theorem 144. Let X be a set of binary points with 𝐴= 𝑃0 and 𝐵on the
𝑃1-side of ←→
𝑂𝐴. Then the degree measure of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴is well deﬁned as
D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) := 90 lub

𝑖
2𝑛−1
 𝑛−1 ∈N, 𝑖< 2𝑛and (𝐵𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 𝐴)𝑂
	
.
The number 90 in the deﬁnition of D has historical roots but has no
mathematical signiﬁcance. For any positive number 𝑢, we could deﬁne 𝑢-
measure M𝑢by replacing 90 with 𝑢in the deﬁnition of degree measure. This
would give us
M𝑢(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵) = 𝑢
90D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵)
for every angle ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵. It would then be easy to check that the restatement
of each of the degree measure theorems we obtain, with M𝑢replacing D and
𝑢replacing 90, would follow as immediate corollaries of those theorems. For
example, taking 𝑢= 𝜋/2 would give us radian measure R and the familiar
conversion
R(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵) =
𝜋
180D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵).
5.3 Angle Measure and Congruence
This section is devoted to the ﬁnal goal of proving Theorem 158 stating that
two angles are congruent if and only if they have the same degree measure.
One direction is a fairly direct consequence of what we already know from
Theorem 116 to be preserved by isometries.
Theorem 145. Isometries preserve degree measure. In symbols, if 𝛼is an
isometry and ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵is an angle, then
D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵) = D(∠𝐴𝛼𝑂𝛼𝐵𝛼).

5.3 Angle Measure and Congruence
61
It remains to prove the converse, that angles with the same degree measure
are congruent. Accordingly we consider a pair of angles with the same degree
measure:
D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵) = D(∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′).
In order to use the fact that these measures are the same, we need to lay
out the context that says how the angles are measured. Let 𝑟be any ﬁxed
number in F+ and consider the circles C := C𝑂
𝑟and C′ := C𝑂′
𝑟. By Corollary 8
we can assume that 𝐴, 𝐵∈C and 𝐴′, 𝐵′ ∈C′. Let X and X′ be systems of
binary points with
𝐴= 𝑃0 ∈X ⊆C and 𝐴′ = 𝑃′
0 ∈X′ ⊆C′
and with 𝑃1 on the 𝐵-side of ←→
𝑂𝐴and 𝑃′
1 on the 𝐵′-side of ←−→
𝑂′𝐴′, as illustrated
in Figure 5.3.

Fig. 5.3 D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) = D(∠𝐵′𝑂′𝐴′).
The task before us is to ﬁnd an isometry 𝛽such that
𝐴𝛽= 𝐴′,
𝑂𝛽= 𝑂′,
and
𝐵𝛽= 𝐵′.
Then we would have ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 ∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′ by Theorem 116. The following lemma
comes close to giving us a successful choice for 𝛽.
Lemma 146. Given the conﬁguration of Figure 5.3, there is an isometry 𝛼
such that
𝐴𝛼= 𝐴′,
𝑂𝛼= 𝑂′
and
𝐵𝛼is on the 𝐵′-side of ←−→
𝑂′𝐴′.
Since this isometry 𝛼preserves degree measure (Theorem 145), we have
D(∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′) = D(∠𝐴𝑂𝐵) = D(𝐴′𝑂′𝐵𝛼).
Since we also have 𝐵𝛼on the 𝐵′-side of ←−→
𝑂′𝐴′, it would appear from Figure 5.3
that 𝐵𝛼should be 𝐵′. If it is, then 𝛽:= 𝛼is the isometry we are seeking.

62
5 Angle Measure
However, our only knowledge of 𝐵′ is that it produces an angle at 𝑂′
of the same degree measure as 𝐵produces at 𝑂. Consequently any proof
that 𝐵𝛼= 𝐵′ will need to use the deﬁnition of degree measure. Suppose, for
example, that 𝐵′ and 𝐵𝛼were two diﬀerent points that were close enough
so that there were no binary points in the interior of ∠𝐵′𝑂′𝐵𝛼. Then the
deﬁnition of degree measure would say that
D(∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′) = D(∠𝐴′𝑂′𝐵𝛼),
but Theorem 35 would tell us that
∠(𝐴′𝑂′𝐵′)  ∠(𝐴′𝑂′𝐵𝛼).
This shows that any proof of Theorem 158 will necessarily imply that every
central angle of C′ must have binary points in its interior. Conversely, you can
check now that this fact is our Lemma 156 and that Theorem 158 immediately
follows.
The proof of Lemma 156 will require a careful examination of how the
binary points are distributed around a circle. In Figure 5.2 we see them
ordered from right to left in a way that corresponds to the numerators of
their subscripts:
𝑃8/4 ... 𝑃7/4 ... 𝑃6/4 ... 𝑃5/4 ... 𝑃4/4 ... 𝑃3/4 ... 𝑃2/4 ... 𝑃1/4 ... 𝑃0/4
The deﬁnition of degree measure uses least upper bounds based on this order.
However, the deﬁnition of binary points produces those same points recur-
sively in a very diﬀerent order that is based on the denominators of their
subscripts:
𝑃0/1, 𝑃1/1, 𝑃2/1, 𝑃1/2, 𝑃3/2, 𝑃1/4, 𝑃3/4, 𝑃5/4, 𝑃7/4, 𝑃1/8, 𝑃3/8, 𝑃5/8, 𝑃7/8 . . . .
Our proofs of facts about the measures of angles formed by binary points
will need to use induction on their denominators, this second order. Yet they
will also need to use the deﬁnition of degree measure which is based on their
numerators, the ﬁrst order. Bridging the gap between these two orders will
be the central theme of this section.
Question. Let 0 < 𝑖< 𝑗< 2𝑛with 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑛∈N. Can you guess the degree
measure of each of the following angles?
∠𝑃1𝑂𝑃0,
∠𝑃1/2𝑂𝑃0,
∠𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1,
∠𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1.
Proving Lemma 156 will require ﬁnding proofs of the answers to these ques-
tions. That process begins with a lemma about the ordering of binary points
with the same denominator.

(Prove this by induction on 𝑛. Assuming it is true for 𝑛−1, prove it for
𝑛by considering diﬀerent possible cases. In each case you will want to use
Lemma 128 and the deﬁnition of binary points. We give here the proof for
one of those cases in seven steps that are illustrated in Figure 5.4. This ﬁgure
shows ﬁve rays for the ﬁve relevant points and seven arcs for the seven steps.

Give a similar argument for each other case.)
The next two lemmas and theorem provide the key to connecting the order
of binary points around the circle with the order of their projections onto the
segments 𝑃2𝑃0 and 𝑃3𝑃1. To address projections to both of those segments
we consider a circle C with center 𝑂, diameter 𝑄2𝑄0 and a point 𝑄1 on C
for which ←−→
𝑂𝑄1 ⊥←−−→
𝑄2𝑄0 (Figure 5.5). If 𝐷is a point of C, we denote by 𝐷∗
the foot of the perpendicular from 𝐷to ←−−→
𝑄2𝑄0. We take 𝐴and 𝐵to be two
points of C on the 𝑄1-side of ←−−→
𝑄2𝑄0 and give short names to four lines:

Lemma 148. Let 𝐴and 𝐵be points on the 𝑄1-side of 𝑞. If |𝑜𝐴, 𝑄0 and
(𝐵𝐴𝑄0)𝑂, then [𝐵∗𝐴∗𝑄0].
(These hypotheses and conclusions give a lot of facts about sides of various
lines. Pick out from them what you need for the proof.)
Lemma 149. Let 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶be three points of C on the same side of ←−−→
𝑄2𝑄0.
Then either (𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂or (𝐵𝐶𝐴)𝑂or (𝐶𝐴𝐵)𝑂.
Theorem 150. If 𝐴and 𝐵are points of C such that (𝐵𝐴𝑄0)𝑂, then [𝐵∗𝐴∗𝑄0].
(Consider three cases: 𝐴, 𝑄0|𝑜or 𝐴∈𝑜or 𝐴, 𝑄2|𝑜. Use the ﬁrst to prove the
third.)
We can now return to the context in which C is a circle with center 𝑂
and X𝑛is a set of 2𝑛+1 binary points for each positive integer 𝑛. Recall from
Theorem 139 that the segments formed by successive points of X𝑛all have
the same length. We will denote that length by
𝑠𝑛:= L(𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1).
We would like to show that 𝑠𝑛is small when 𝑛is large. To do this it will be
suﬃcient to focus primarily on the ﬁrst quadrant of C. For each point 𝐴on
C let 𝐴↓be the foot of the perpendicular from 𝐴to ←−→
𝑂𝑃0 and 𝐴←be the foot
of the perpendicular from 𝐴to ←−→
𝑂𝑃1. (See Figure 5.6.) For example,
𝑃↓
1 = 𝑂, 𝑃↓
0 = 𝑃0, 𝑃←
1 = 𝑃1 and 𝑃←
0 = 𝑂.
In Lemma 147 we saw that the order of binary points of X𝑛around
the circle matched the order of their subscripts. Combining that fact with

Lemma 148 you can now show that the order of their projections on 𝑂𝑃0 and
𝑂𝑃1 also match the order of their subscripts.
Theorem 151. Let C be a circle with center 𝑂and let X be a set of binary
points on C. If 𝑛−1 ∈N and 2𝑛−1 > 𝑗> 𝑖> 0, then
(i) [𝑂𝑃↓

𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃←

(Use Lemma 147 and Theorem 150 with appropriate choices for 𝑄0, 𝑄1 and
∗.)
Theorem 151 tells us that the projections of the binary points from 𝑃0 to
𝑂and from 𝑂to 𝑃1 lie in exactly the order of their numerical subscripts,
justifying the illustration in Figure 5.7 for 𝑛= 3. This fact allows us to give
a tight upper bound for the length 𝑠𝑛of the segments connecting adjacent
binary points of X𝑛.
Theorem 152. Let C be a circle with center 𝑂, radius 𝑟and binary points
X and let 2 < 𝑛∈N with 𝑖< 2𝑛. Then
𝑠𝑛= L(𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1) <

Fig. 5.7 Proof of Theorem 152 for 𝑛= 3.
(Use induction on 𝑛.)
Lemma 154. Let C be a circle with center 𝑂and let 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶be points of C
such that (𝐴𝐵𝐶)𝑂. Then L(𝐴𝐵) < L(𝐴𝐶).
(Use Theorem 135.)
Lemma 155. If 𝐴and 𝐵are points of C on the same side of ←−−→
𝑃2𝑃0 with
(𝐵𝐴𝑃0)𝑂, then there is a binary point in the interior of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴.
Lemma 156. If 𝐴and 𝐵are points of C on the same side of ←−−→
𝑃2𝑃0 with
(𝐵𝐴𝑃0)𝑂, then there are at least two binary points in the interior of ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴.
This fact has two important consequences. First, we can now show that the
ordering of angles can be deﬁned in terms of degree measure.
Theorem 157. One angle is less than another if and only if it has smaller
degree measure. In symbols,
∠𝐴< ∠𝐵if and only if D(∠𝐴) < D(∠𝐵).
We can also see that congruence of angles can be deﬁned in terms of degree
measure.

5.4 The Angle Measure Theorem
67
Theorem 158. Angles are congruent if and only if they have the same degree
measure. In symbols,
∠𝐴 ∠𝐵if and only if D(∠𝐴) = D(∠𝐵).
5.4 The Angle Measure Theorem
We now have the tools we need to prove our Angle Measure Theorem 164.
This theorem is the analog of the Length Measure Axiom (LMA) for length
measure and the Area Measure Theorem 120 for area measure. As part (ii)
of this theorem is our Theorem 158, it remains to prove parts (i) and (iii).
Lemma 159. If 𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 is a binary point with 𝑛a positive integer and 0 <
𝑖< 2𝑛, then
D(∠𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃0) =
90𝑖
2𝑛−1 .
Lemma 160 (Angle Measure (i)). Every right angle has degree measure 90.
The proof of Angle Measure (iii) will require two lemmas. The ﬁrst says
that certain rotations are isometries.

Fig. 5.9 Proof of Lemma 163.
(Suppose D(∠𝐶𝑂𝐴) were greater than D(∠𝐶𝑂𝐵) + D(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) by some pos-
itive amount 𝑥. We would like to ﬁnd a contradiction. Lemma 162 tells us
that the degree measure D(∠𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1) of the central angles of X𝑛
gets very small when 𝑛grows large. Imagine now that you choose 𝑛large
enough so that
90
2𝑛−1 is very small relative to 𝑥. Then the degree measures of
∠𝐶𝑂𝐴, ∠𝐶𝑂𝐵and ∠𝐵𝑂𝐴in Figure 5.9 should be very close, relative to 𝑥, to
the degree measures of ∠𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝐴, ∠𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1 and ∠𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝐴,
respectively. Using Lemma 162 you can then calculate the diﬀerence
D(∠𝑃( 𝑗+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝐴) −(D(∠𝑃𝑗/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1) + D(∠𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝐴)).
By the choice of 𝑛, this diﬀerence should be very close to both 𝑥and 0, giving
you a contradiction.)

Chapter 6
Trigonometry
We say that an angle is acute if it is less than a right angle. This chapter
is about that part of trigonometry that intersects high school geometry: the
trigonometric functions of acute angles. We will start with the point at which
these functions of acute angles arise from the study of similarity, and then
establish some properties of them that will be needed in Chapters 7 and 8.
The degree measure of an acute angle is a real number in the open interval
(0,90). We will denote by D the subset of (0,90) consisting of all numbers that
are the degree measure of some acute angle. Our use of the set D contrasts
with Birkhoﬀ’s Protractor Postulate, which says that every number in (0,90)
is the degree measure of some acute angle. In Chapter 8 we will see that there
are many models of our axioms in which D is only countably inﬁnite, falling
far short of being all of (0, 90).
Lemma 176. The following numbers are guaranteed to be in D.
(i) If 0 < 𝑖, 𝑛∈N and 𝑖< 2𝑛−1, then 90𝑖/2𝑛−1 ∈D.
(ii) If 𝑥∈D, then 𝑥/2 ∈D.
(iii) The numbers 30 and 60 are in D, but not included in (i).
(iv) If 𝑥∈D and 𝑥< 45, then 2𝑥∈D.
If 𝑥∈D, we label an angle in a ﬁgure with the symbol “𝑥◦” to indicate
that it has degree measure 𝑥. Given a particular number 𝑥∈D, Figure 6.1
illustrates several right triangles having an angle of measure 𝑥.
By Corollary 90 (A) we know that these triangles are all similar. By The-
orem 88 we know that their corresponding pairs of sides are in the same
ratio:
𝑜
𝑎= 𝑜′
𝑎′ = 𝑜′′
𝑎′′ ,
𝑜
ℎ= 𝑜′
ℎ′ = 𝑜′′
ℎ′′ ,
𝑎
ℎ= 𝑎′
ℎ′ = 𝑎′′
ℎ′′ .
This means that the values of these three ratios depend only on the measure
𝑥of the angle and not which triangle is used to calculate it. The same is
true of the inverses of these ratios. Each of these ratios deﬁnes a real valued
function on D. For 𝑥∈D we deﬁne

At this point we would like to make some observations about the set D
of acute angle measures. Figure 6.3 is an illustration of a triangle that may
or may not exist in a particular plane. Speciﬁcally, such a triangle will exist
if and only if 𝑎and 𝑏are in F+ and 𝑥is in D. Thus such a triangle will be
found in the plane for all choices of 𝑎, 𝑏∈R+ and all choices of 𝑥∈(0, 90) if
F+ = R+ and D = (0, 90). Recall that Birkhoﬀ’s Ruler Postulate (pages 9 and
100) implies that F+ = R+. Birkhoﬀused a similar assumption, his Protractor
Postulate (page 101), which implies that D = (0, 90). Consequently, it is
customary to add these two postulates in high school texts as further axioms
so that students are guaranteed that F+ = R+ and D = (0, 90).

Fig. 6.3 A possible triangle?
We have not included either of these postulates for two reasons. One is
that, as you are seeing, they are simply not needed to establish the standard
theorems of Euclidean geometry. The other is that, in general, as we add
more axioms to a mathematical theory we can prove more theorems at the
cost of having fewer models to which they apply. In short, we have the choice
of saying more about less or saying less about more.
In Chapter 8 you will see that this tradeoﬀis very stark in the present con-
text. There we show that our axioms have a vast array of models, including
uncountably many countable models. If we assume as additional axioms the
Ruler Postulate and that our angle measure function D satisﬁes the Protrac-
tor Postulate, then we will be able to guarantee the existence of the triangle
in Figure 6.3 for all 𝑎, 𝑏∈R+ and all 𝑥∈(0, 90). But then Corollary 247 will
tell us that the axioms will have only one model, the coordinate plane of the
real numbers.
However, for the beneﬁt of those who prefer to use Birkhoﬀ’s two postu-
lates, we would like to point out something interesting. If you add the Ruler
Postulate to our axioms, then you can prove that our angle measure function
D satisﬁes the Protractor Postulate as a theorem and therefore not need to
assume it as an axiom. To see how to do this, consider the setting in which
C is a circle with center 𝑂, with radius 1 and with a set X ⊆C of binary
points.

Lemma 177. The tangent is an increasing function of angle measure, that
is, ∠𝐴𝑂𝑃0 < ∠𝐵𝑂𝑃0 implies tan(∠𝐴𝑂𝑃0) < tan(∠𝐵𝑂𝑃0).
Theorem 178. If every positive real number is the length of some segment,
then every number between 0 and 90 is the degree measure of some acute
angle. In symbols,
F+ = R+ implies D = (0, 90).
(Assume F+ = R+ and let 𝑥∈(0, 90). You need to ﬁnd an angle with degree
measure 𝑥. Let

Since 𝑥is an upper bound for 𝑆, Lemma 177 says that tan(𝑥) is an upper
bound for 𝑇. Let 𝑡= lub(𝑇) be the least upper bound of 𝑇. Since
𝑡∈R+ = F+,
there is a point 𝐴on the 𝑃1-side of ←−→
𝑂𝑃0 such that ←−→

A right triangle is described by ﬁve measurements: two acute angles and
three sides. Altogether these theorems say that if we make any two of these
measurements that include at least one side, then there is only one possible
outcome for each of the other three. This should raise an obvious question:
Assuming there is a triangle with two of those measurements, how can we
calculate the unique values of the other three?

Fig. 6.5 Right triangles with three missing measurements. [2]
At this point high school students can answer this question by using
trigonometric functions to ﬁnd values of these missing measurements. For
example, given a small table of trigonometric values or a calculator, they
can approximate the values the three missing measurements in each of the
triangles shown in Figure 6.5.

These are similar to the right triangle congruence theorems. Each of them
tells us that if we make three particular direct measurements in a triangle,
then there is only one possible value for each of the remaining three mea-
surements. For example, ASA and AAS guarantee that the three missing
measurements in each of the triangles in Figure 6.6 are uniquely determined.
Using trigonometry high school students can calculate all of those values.

Chapter 7
Circle Measure
In this chapter we will prove that there is a real number 𝜋such that, for
every circle C with radius 𝑟, the circumference 𝑐and the area 𝑐are given by
𝑐= 2𝜋𝑟and 𝑎= 𝜋𝑟2.
In the process we will show how to calculate the number 𝜋to as much ac-
curacy as we like. To do this it will be necessary to deﬁne circumference in
a way that is consistent with and in the spirit of the length measure func-
tion L and to deﬁne area in a way that is an extension of the area measure
function A. We will begin in Section 7.1 by extending area measure beyond
polygonal regions to a broad range of other ﬁgures. By the area of circle C
we will mean the area of the closed disc C that is the union of C and its
inside.
All of this will require ﬁnding convex polygons that are good approxima-
tions to the circle C. We say that a convex polygon is inscribed in C if its
vertices are all on C. It circumscribes C if each of its sides is tangent to C.
In Section 7.2 we will look for convex polygons that are inscribed in C and,
in Section 7.3, convex polygons that circumscribe C. These approximations
of C will be drawn directly from our work with angle measure in Chapter 5
and trigonometry in Chapter 6.
In the ﬁnal Section 7.4 we will see if these approximations are good enough
to apply the method of Section 7.1 for computing the area of C and to use
a similar method to compute its circumference. The number 𝜋will appear
along the way as a natural outcome of these investigations.
7.1 Jordan Measure of Area
There are many irregularly shaped ﬁgures that are not polygonal regions but
can be closely approximated by polygonal regions, like the one illustrated in

7 Circle Measure
Figure 7.1. In this section we will show how the domain of the area function A
from Chapter 4 can be extended beyond polygonal regions to include these
ﬁgures. If Z is a ﬁgure, let L be the set of all areas of polygonal regions
contained in Z and let U be the set of all areas of polygonal regions that
contain Z. If there is exactly one positive real number 𝑥such that
𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏for all 𝑎∈L and 𝑏∈U,
then we deﬁne J (Z), the Jordan measure [9] of Z, to be 𝑥. Otherwise we
say that Z is not Jordan measurable. Figure 7.1 illustrates an example of an
irregularly shaped region Z and a polygonal region contained in it whose area
𝑎∈L is close to J (Z).
Fig. 7.1 Estimating an area with a polygonal region. [2]
At this point it is important to recognize that Jordan measure oﬀers a
conceptually satisfying notion of area. But it is not at all obvious that it
agrees with the notion of area given in Chapter 4 when Z is a polygonal
region. Also, the deﬁnition of Jordan measure gives us no practical way to
calculate its value on a particular ﬁgure, as it asks us to examine the area of
every polygonal region that is either contained in or contains that ﬁgure. Our
goal in this section will be to prove two theorems. Theorem 200 will say that
Jordan measure does indeed coincide with area measure when it is applied
to polygonal regions. This fact will allow us to extend the notion of area by
deﬁning the area of an arbitrary ﬁgure to be its Jordan measure in case the
ﬁgure is Jordan measurable. Theorem 201 will tell us how we can calculate

7.1 Jordan Measure of Area
83
Jordan measure using only a carefully selected sample of these polygonal
regions.
These two theorems will both be easy consequences of Theorem 199, whose
proof will be the primary focus of our eﬀorts in this section. As an immediate
consequence of the deﬁnition of Jordan measure we ﬁnd that, if F and G are
Jordan measurable ﬁgures, then
F ⊆G implies that J (F) ≤J (G).
Theorem 199 will say that the area measure function A has the same property
when F and G are restricted to polygonal regions:
F ⊆G implies that A(F) ≤A(G).
That assertion is the yet unproven part (iv) of the Area Measure Axiom
of [2]. It may be helpful to skip to the end of this section ﬁrst to see how
the proofs of Theorems 200 and 201 both use nothing from this section other
than Theorem 199.
As was the case with angle measure, a full treatment of area measure
beyond polygonal area, and particularly to circles, is not included in the
same three standard texts.
•
Hartshorne’s Chapter 5 in [7] gives a modern foundation for Euclid’s work
on areas. Variants of our Theorems 193 and 198 are given as exercises 22.1
and 22.2, but they are not used to extend area measure beyond polygonal
regions.
•
Millman and Parker [10] give a detailed account of polygonal area but
make no mention of an extension to areas of other regions.
•
Moise [11] presents Jordan measure to ﬁnd the area of a circle by mak-
ing direct use of Theorem 199 as we do. But he gives no reference or
justiﬁcation for this fact at all. (See [11], p336, Theorem 1 on p337 and
Theorem 4 on p338.)
Estimating areas of irregular regions with polygonal regions is a practical
application of geometry that is normally taught in high school and is included
in [2]. (See, for example, Figure 7.17.) Theorem 199 provides the justiﬁcation
for this technique. Its proof will require that we step beyond classical geom-
etry and draw on some techniques from topology. A few simple deﬁnitions,
extending those from Section 4.1, will give us all the tools that we need to
do this.
Let F be a ﬁgure and let 𝑃be a point. Then 𝑃is a limit point of F if
every open disc containing 𝑃contains a point of F other than 𝑃. (Note that a
limit point of F may or may not be in F.) With this terminology we see that
the boundary F𝑏of F is just the set of points of F that are limit points of
its complement and the interior F𝑖of F is the set of points of F that are not
limit points of its complement. The closure of F is the set F𝑐consisting of F
together will all of its limit points. We say that F is closed if it contains all

84
7 Circle Measure
of its limit points, that is, F𝑐= F. It is easy to see that the closure of every
ﬁgure F is itself closed, that F𝑐𝑐= F𝑐.
Adding to these standard operations on ﬁgures, we deﬁne the image of F
under the composition ∗= 𝑖𝑐as the closure F∗:= F𝑖𝑐of the interior of F.
Figure 7.2 shows how an application of ∗can be thought of informally as
shaving oﬀwhiskers and then regenerating bald spots. Note that
if F is closed, then F∗⊆F
since F∗= F𝑖𝑐⊆F𝑐= F. We call ∗the grooming operation and say that F
is well groomed if grooming F with ∗leaves it unchanged, that is, if F∗= F.

Fig. 7.6 Six samples of intersections of triangular regions, each outlined in boldface.
Based on Lemma 192 we might be tempted to conjecture that the inter-
section of two polygonal regions whose interiors intersect is again a polygonal
region. However, the right column in Figure 7.9 shows that this is not true,
but suggests that grooming the intersection might make it into a polygonal
region.
Theorem 193. If F and G are polygonal regions whose interiors intersect,
then (F ∩G)∗is a polygonal region.
( Let U and V be ﬁnite collections of triangles such that

To determine what this is, we apply Lemma 192 and partition the regions
S ∩T into two collections, W and W′, with W being those that are convex
polygonal regions and W′ being those that are empty, a point or a segment.

Theorem 194. If S and T are triangular regions, then (T\S)∗is either empty
or is a polygonal region.
(Let S = △𝑋𝑌𝑍. Choose points 𝑋′ ∉H(←→
𝑌𝑍, 𝑋), 𝑌′ ∉H(←→
𝑍𝑋,𝑌) and 𝑍′ ∉
H(←→
𝑋𝑌, 𝑍) as in Figure 7.7. Let 𝑈,𝑉and 𝑊be the three vertices of S in some
order. Then 𝑈𝑉is a T-side of S if T contains a point of H(←→
𝑈𝑉, 𝑊′), that is,
T protrudes beyond side 𝑈𝑉of S.
Prove the theorem in four cases depending on the number of T-sides that
S has. In each case label the vertices of S with “𝑋”, “𝑌” and “𝑍” in such
a way that its T-sides precede its non-T-sides in the sequence 𝑋𝑌, 𝑌𝑍, 𝑍𝑋.
Use Lemmas 108, 191 and 192 to express (T\S)∗as the union of polygonal
regions with disjoint interiors. Then use Theorem 120(iii).)

Theorem 198. If F is a polygonal region and G is a polygonal region, then
(G\F)∗is either empty or is a polygonal region.
(Use induction on the number 𝑛of triangular regions that make up F, starting
with Lemma 195. Assume it is true for 𝑛and let U be a collection of 𝑛+ 1
triangular regions with disjoint interiors that have F as their union. Pick one
triangular region T ∈U and let H be the union of the 𝑛remaining regions
in U. Then F and H have disjoint interiors, F = T∪H and (G\T)∗and (G\H)∗
are polygonal regions by induction. Now assume (G\F)∗≠∅. Then

Since (G\H)∗and (G\T)∗are polygonal regions, ((G\T)∗∩(G\H)∗)∗is a
polygonal region by Theorem 193. Complete the proof by showing that
(G\F)∗= ((G\T)∗∩(G\H)∗)∗as is shown in Figure 7.9.)
Using Theorem 198 and the Area Measure Theorem 120(iii) you can at
last prove part (iv) of the Area Measure Axiom of [2].
Theorem 199. If F and G are polygonal regions and F ⊆G, then A(F) ≤
A(G).

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 199 we see that the Jordan
measure function J is indeed an extension of the polygonal area measure
function A.
Theorem 200. Every polygonal region Z is Jordan measurable, and its Jor-
dan measure is the same as its area:
J (Z) = A(Z).
Using this theorem we can unambiguously deﬁne the area of a Jordan mea-
surable region Z as its Jordan measure J (Z).
As a second application of Theorem 199 and the completeness property
of the real numbers, we have the following test for Jordan measurability and
method of ﬁnding Jordan measure. This test and method were ﬁrst introduced
by Archimedes of Syracuse (c.287 BCE - 212 BCE) to ﬁnd calculate the
area of a circle. We will use Theorem 201 to give a modern version of that
derivation.

90
7 Circle Measure
Theorem 201. Let Z be a ﬁgure and assume that U is a set of polygonal
regions contained in Z and V is a set of polygonal regions that contain Z. If,
for every 𝜖> 0, there are F ∈U and G ∈V with A(G) −A(F) < 𝜖, then Z is
Jordan measurable and its Jordan measure is the unique number J (Z) such
that, for all F ∈U and G ∈V,
A(F) ≤J (Z) ≤A(G)
If we can ﬁnd sets U and V of polygonal regions with areas we can readily
calculate, we can often verify the conditions of Theorem 201 and use this
theorem to ﬁnd the area of Z. This same theorem will allow us to estimate
areas of physical regions that can be closely approximated by polygonal re-
gions. Figure 7.1 illustrates an example of such an approximation, where the
polygonal region is shown as a union of triangular and rectangular regions
with disjoint interiors.
7.2 Inscribed Convex Polygons
In this section we will present a sequence of convex polygons inscribed in
the circle C and prove two theorems: Theorem 205 giving their perimeters
and Theorem 208 giving their areas. Just as we used binary points to mea-
sure angles in Chapter 5, we will use binary points here to measure circles.
Accordingly, let
X = X1 ∪X2 ∪X3 ∪. . .
be an arbitrary but ﬁxed set of binary points of C as described in Chapter 5.
For each positive integer 𝑛we deﬁne
i𝑛:=
Ø
{𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1 | 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1}.
We will show that I𝑛is a convex polygon. (Figure 7.10.) If 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1,
we refer to the angle ∠𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 as a central angle of I𝑛. Recall
from Lemma 153 that every point not on one of these central angles is in the
interior of exactly one of them.
Lemma 202. If 𝑛is a positive integer and 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1, then no point of
X𝑛is in the interior of ∠𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1.
Lemma 203. If 𝑛is a positive integer, then I𝑛is a convex polygon inscribed
in C.
Figure 7.10 illustrates the convex polygons I1, I2, I3, . . . inscribed in C.
This illustration suggests that these convex polygons might be good inner
approximations to the circle C. To use this idea we deﬁne the perimeter of

perimeter of the convex polygon I𝑛:
𝑝♭
𝑛:=
∑︁
{L(𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1) | 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1}.
We can calculate the lengths of the sides of I𝑛by using the trigonometric
functions from Chapter 6.
Lemma 204. If circle C has radius 𝑟and 𝑛∈N, then each side of the convex
polygon I𝑛has length
L(𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑃(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1) = 2𝑟sin   90

extracting the part of this quantity that is independent of the radius of the
circle. For each positive integer 𝑛we deﬁne
𝜋𝑛:= 2𝑛+1 sin   90
2𝑛
 .
This gives us the following conclusion.

Theorem 205. If C is a circle of radius 𝑟and 𝑛∈N, then the perimeter of

𝑛= 2𝜋𝑛𝑟.
Our next step will be to ﬁnd the area of each I𝑛. The proof of Theorem 99
shows that each I𝑛is a convex polygonal region based on a standard trian-
gulation for convex polygons. But our work here will be facilitated by using
a diﬀerent triangulation consisting of a set of congruent triangles. For each
𝑛∈N and 𝑖< 2𝑛+1 we will simplify notation with the abbreviation

Together Theorems 207 and 208 tell us that, if C is Jordan measurable, then
its area is greater than 𝜋𝑛𝑟2 cos(90/2𝑛).
7.3 Circumscribed Convex Polygons
In this section we will present a sequence of convex polygons that circumscribe
circle C with radius 𝑟and prove Theorem 210 giving their perimeters and
areas. For each positive integer 𝑛, let C𝑛be the circle with center 𝑂and
radius
𝑟′ := 𝑟sec   90
2𝑛
 .
For larger values of 𝑛, the number sec(90/2𝑛) is only slightly bigger than one,
and consequently C𝑛is a circle slightly larger than C with the same center 𝑂.
For each 𝑖< 2𝑛+1, we take 𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1 to be the point of intersection of −−−−−−−→
𝑂𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1
with C𝑛. This gives us a set of binary points of C𝑛which, by Lemma 203,
forms a convex polygon
O𝑛:=
Ø
{𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑄(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1 | 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1}
that is inscribed in C𝑛.
In contrast to the binary points {𝑃𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 𝑛∈N and 𝑖< 2𝑛+1}, all of which
lie on the circle C, we have here binary points {𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 𝑛∈N and 𝑖< 2𝑛+1}
lying on a series of disjoint circles, namely,
{𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1 | 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1} ⊆C𝑛.
(Figure 7.14.) When we write “𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1”, the denominator 2𝑛−1 indicates that
we mean the binary point on C𝑛. Thus “𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1” and “𝑄2𝑖/2𝑛” refer to diﬀerent
points because they lie on diﬀerent circles.
For each 𝑖< 2𝑛+1, let S𝑖,𝑛= △𝑄𝑖/2𝑛−1𝑂𝑄(𝑖+1)/2𝑛−1. By Lemma 206 the
polygonal region O𝑛is the union of these triangular regions:
O𝑛=
Ø
{S𝑖,𝑛| 0 ≤𝑖< 2𝑛+1}.
Thus far we have not said anything about the relation between the convex
polygon O𝑛and the original circle C.

7.4 Area, Circumference and the Number 𝝅
We are now in a position to apply Theorem 201 to show that every circle is
Jordan measurable, to calculate it area, and to deﬁne and calculate its cir-

7.4 Area, Circumference and the Number 𝜋
95
cumference. These results will require that we ﬁrst deﬁne the special number
𝜋and give a procedure to ﬁnd its decimal digits.
To complete these tasks we will need to understand the asymptotic be-
havior of the sequences [𝑝♭
𝑛], [𝑎♭
𝑛], [𝑝♯
𝑛] and [𝑎♯
𝑛]. Recall that
𝑎♭
𝑛:= A(I𝑛) and 𝑎♯
𝑛:= A(O𝑛).
We have described these sequences in Theorems 205, 208 and 210 using the
special sequence [𝜋𝑛], where
𝜋𝑛:= 2𝑛+1 sin   90
2𝑛
 .
Yet the asymptotic behavior of this sequence is not immediately apparent.
The sequence [2𝑛+1] rapidly approaches inﬁnity while the sequence [sin( 90
2𝑛)]
goes quickly to zero by Lemma 181. The answers to these questions start
with an application of the Triangle Inequality.
Lemma 211. The sequence [𝑝♭
𝑛] is increasing.
Theorem 212. The sequence [𝜋𝑛] is increasing and bounded above by 4, and
therefore converges to a number that we will denote by the Greek letter “𝜋”:
𝜋:= lim
𝑛→∞𝜋𝑛= lim
𝑛→∞2𝑛+1 sin   90
2𝑛
 ≤4.
In contrast to Lemma 211, Figure 7.14 suggests that the perimeters of the
convex polygons O𝑛get progressively smaller. The proof of this fact is a direct
application of the double angle formula of Theorem 180 for the tangent.
Lemma 213. The sequence [𝑝♯
𝑛] is decreasing.
Another sequence we need to inquire about is [𝜋𝑛sec(90/2𝑛)]. It is easy to
see from Lemma 181 that this sequence must converge to 𝜋, but it is not easy
to see at a glance whether it is either increasing or decreasing. The following
lemma will have two important corollaries.
Lemma 214. The sequence [𝜋𝑛sec   90
2𝑛
] is decreasing.
Corollary 215. If 𝑛is a positive integer, then
𝜋𝑛< 𝜋< 𝜋𝑛sec   90
2𝑛
 .
Notice that, while Theorem 212 gives a precise deﬁnition of the number
𝜋, it does not oﬀer any constructive method to determine the decimal digits
of 𝜋. It only tells us that 𝜋exceeds 𝜋𝑛for every 𝑛∈N, and that 𝜋≤4, but
this information puts no constraint on the value of any decimal digit of 𝜋.
Corollary 215 is signiﬁcant because it gives us a direct way to calculate these
digits. If the lower bound 𝜋𝑛and the upper bound 𝜋𝑛sec(90/2𝑛) round to
the same ﬁrst 𝑘digits, then those will be the ﬁrst 𝑘digits of 𝜋. Calculating

96
7 Circle Measure
some initial windows like this shows that [𝜋𝑛] converges very rapidly. This
process is illustrated in Figure 7.15 where we demonstrate that the correct
value of 𝜋to eight decimal places is

Our calculation of circle area is going to require knowing that the sequence
[𝑎♯
𝑛] is decreasing. It is tempting to want to prove this using Theorem 199.
But a close look at Figure 7.14 shows that O2 ⊈O1 since every other vertex of
O2 lies outside of O1. We can now prove this inequality without Theorem 199
by comparing our calculations of both values.
Corollary 216. If 𝑛is a positive integer, then 𝑎♯
𝑛+1 < 𝑎♯
𝑛.
We now have all the pieces required to apply Theorem 201 to the circle C.
To do so we deﬁne
U := {I𝑛| 0 < 𝑛∈N} and V := {O𝑛| 0 < 𝑛∈N}.
Corollary 217. The sets U and V satisfy all of the conditions of Theo-
rem 201.
(i) Each I𝑛∈U is a polygonal region contained in C.
(ii) Each O𝑛∈V is a polygonal region that contains C.
(iii) For each positive number 𝜖, there is an I𝑛∈U and an O𝑛∈V such that
𝑎♯
𝑛−𝑎♭
𝑛< 𝜖.
Applying Theorem 201 and Corollary 217 will give us two important con-
sequences.

Theorem 218. For every circle C, the closed disc C is Jordan measurable,
and its Jordan measure is the unique number 𝑎such that
𝑎♭
𝑛≤𝑎≤𝑎♯
𝑛
for every positive integer 𝑛.
The fact that C is Jordan measurable alone provides a justiﬁcation for
estimating the area of a circle without having a formula for the area that is
used in [2] and is taught in high schools. We place over the circle C of radius
10 a grid of one-by-one squares as shown in Figure 7.17. We then outline the
polygonal region X consisting of all squares contained in C and the polygonal
region Y consisting of all squares that intersect C. The area of each of these
regions is just the number of squares it contains. In the example shown in
Figure 7.17, we conclude that
A(X) = 268 ≤𝑎≤332 = A(Y).
Averaging these two bounds gives us an approximate estimate of the area as
𝑎≈300.
Ideally we would like to ﬁnd the exact value of the area of C. Theorem 201
tells us that, if we can ﬁnd a particular number which is between 𝑎♭
𝑛and 𝑎♯
𝑛
for every 𝑛∈N, then that number would have to be the exact area of C.
Theorem 219. The area of a circle C with radius 𝑟is
𝑎= 𝜋𝑟2.
This shows that the estimate 𝑎≈300 for the area of the circle of radius 𝑟= 10
in Figure 7.17 is not too far from the actual value 𝑎= 𝜋102 = 314.159 . . . .

We will say that the circle C has circumference 𝑐if 𝑐is the unique number
that is greater than the perimeter 𝑝♭
𝑛of I𝑛and less that the perimeter 𝑝♯
𝑛of
O𝑛for every positive integer 𝑛. The facts we now have show that every circle
does have a circumference and say just what that circumference is.
Theorem 220. The circumference of a circle C with radius 𝑟is
𝑐= 2𝜋𝑟.

Chapter 8
Consistency and Models
Chapter 7 concludes the investigation we laid out in the introduction to
Chapter 1. We have stated ten axioms of geometry and proved a vast array
of theorems from them that includes all of the standard facts of geometry that
arise in the high school curriculum. This tells us that all of these theorems
are true in every model P = ⟨P; 𝑑⟩of our axioms. This sounds marvelous.
However, before we celebrate, there is an important question we need to
answer:
Is there really a plane P that is a model of our axioms?
This is by no means an idle question. The foundations of modern set the-
ory and logic were ﬁrst laid out in 1903 by Gottlob Frege [5], only to have this
initial version undermined by Bertrand Russell whose famous paradox was
obtained by proving a contradiction from Frege’s axioms. When a contradic-
tion is proven from a set of axioms, we say that the axioms are inconsistent.
Since a contradiction cannot be true in any model, this means that there is
no model of those axioms. As a result the theory built from those axioms is
literally a theory about nothing. Before we conclude, we would like to ﬁnd
some reassurance that the axioms we have used here, and therefore also in [2],
are indeed consistent, that is, no contradiction can be proven from them.
The standard way to show that a set of axioms is consistent is to exhibit a
model of those axioms.
If we can do this, we would ideally like to answer a second question:
Exactly which planes are models of our axioms?
This question is generally more diﬃcult to answer. For example, the group
axioms are consistent since every group is a model of them. But we are far
from having a complete description of all groups.
In this chapter we will give a full answer to both of these questions for our
axioms. Doing this requires an important shift in perspective. We will not
be proving any more theorems from our axioms. Instead we will be proving
theorems about our axioms. The statement that a set of axioms is or is not

consistent, for example, is a statement about those axioms. See Appendix B.10
for the connection of this work to [2].
8.1 Birkhoﬀ’s Geometry
To answer these questions we will draw on the text [10] Geometry: A Metric
Approach with Models by Millman and Parker. This book oﬀers a version of
the metric axioms of Birkhoﬀ[1] to provide a very clean axiomatic develop-
ment of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry that includes much of the what
we have given here. We will present a brief outline of their development. All
page references in this chapter refer to [10] and we will use some results cited
from [10] as well.
Millman and Parker study what we will call an MP-plane, that is, a
structure
G = ⟨P; 𝑑, L, 𝑚⟩
where P is a set of objects called points that is endowed with three additional
primitive constructs:
•
𝑑: P × P →R, a distance function as we have used,
•
L, a non-empty collection of subsets of P called lines,
•
𝑚, a real valued function on subsets of P called angles.
Using just the primitive constructs of point, distance and line, the following
constructs are deﬁned in [10] for G exactly as we have deﬁned them in this
text:
between, segment, length, ray, circle,
radius, inside and outside of a circle.
The text [10] includes two very strong axioms of Birkhoﬀ[1] that we have
not used. The ﬁrst says that every line can be coordinatized with the real
numbers (pp 25-28).
Ruler Postulate. For every line ℓof G there is a bijection 𝑓ℓ: ℓ→R such
that, for all 𝑃, 𝑄∈ℓ, we have | 𝑓ℓ(𝑃) −𝑓ℓ(𝑄)| = 𝑑(𝑃, 𝑄).
An MP-plane G is deﬁned in [10] to be a Euclidean geometry if it satisﬁes
a list of axioms that we now describe.
•
An MP-plane is an incidence geometry if it satisﬁes the 2PA and the 3PA
(p20).
•
An incidence geometry is a metric geometry if it satisﬁes the Ruler Pos-
tulate (p25, p28).
If the Ruler Postulate holds in G and 𝑡is any positive real number, the
surjectivity of 𝑓ℓtells us that there are points 𝑃and 𝑄in ℓsuch that 𝑓ℓ(𝑃) = 𝑡

8.1 Birkhoﬀ’s Geometry
101
and 𝑓ℓ(𝑄) = 0. Thus 𝑑(𝑃, 𝑄) = |𝑡−0| = 𝑡, and therefore the additive semigroup
F+ associated with G consists of all positive real numbers, that is, F+ = R+.
In item #15, page 54, it is proven from these axioms that a subset ℓof P
is a line in L if and only if there are two points 𝐴and 𝐵with
ℓ= ←−−
𝐴𝐵∪−−→
𝐴𝐵.
Consequently we can add more to our list of terms and phrases that have the
same meaning in all models of the MP-axioms as they do in our geometry:
line, parallel lines, collinear, angle, triangle, sides of a line,
interior of an angle, inside of a triangle, triangular region.
•
A metric geometry is a Pasch geometry if it satisﬁes a condition that is
equivalent to the PSA by Theorems 4.3.1 and 4.3.3 of [10].
The second axiom of [10] introduced by Birkhoﬀthat we have not used
concerns angle measure (p83).
Protractor Postulate. If −−→
𝐵𝐶is a ray and 𝑡is a real number such that
0 < 𝑡< 180, then on each side of ←→
𝐵𝐶there is a unique ray −−→
𝐵𝐴such that
𝑚(∠𝐴𝐵𝐶) = 𝑡.
The function 𝑚on the angles of G is called a degree measure function
if it satisﬁes the Protractor Postulate, the additivity condition (iii) of Theo-
rem 164 and each angle has measure between 0 and 180.
•
A protractor geometry is a Pasch geometry in which 𝑚is a degree measure
function (p83, p84).
In a protractor geometry an angle in G is deﬁned to be a right angle if it has
measure 90. Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect at right angles.
Angles are deﬁned to be congruent if they have the same measure. (pp 96
-100.) We will need only one fact from [10] about angle measure.
Theorem 11.1.14. Isometries preserve angle measure 𝑚.
•
A neutral geometry is a protractor geometry satisfying SAS (p118).
•
A Euclidean geometry is a neutral geometry satisfying EUC (p183).
To summarize, a Euclidean geometry is an MP-plane in which 𝑑is a
distance function, 𝑚is a degree measure function, our axioms 2PA, 3PA,
PSA, SAS and EUC all hold and the Ruler Postulate holds. We will refer to
this set of axioms for a Euclidean geometry as the MP-axioms.
Millman and Parker answer both of the questions we posed in the intro-
duction of this chapter for the MP-axioms. To prove consistency, they take
R to be the set of real numbers and form its coordinate plane R as follows.
The points of R are ordered pairs (𝑥, 𝑦) of numbers 𝑥, 𝑦∈R forming the set

102
8 Consistency and Models
R2 := R×R. The distance function 𝑑R is deﬁned for 𝐴= (𝑥, 𝑦) and 𝐵= (𝑢, 𝑣)
as
𝑑R(𝐴, 𝐵) :=
√︁
(𝑥−𝑢)2 + (𝑦−𝑣)2.
The set LR consists of all lines ←→
𝐴𝐵:= ←−−
𝐴𝐵∪−−→
𝐴𝐵where 𝐴and 𝐵are two points
of R2. The degree measure function is deﬁned using inner products, vector
norms and the inverse cosine function as
𝑚R(∠𝐵𝑂𝐴) := cos−1 
⟨𝐵−𝑂,𝐴−𝑂⟩
||𝐵−𝑂||·||𝐴−𝑂||

.
As they present the MP-axioms, they show progressively that each one holds
in the MP-plane
R = ⟨R2; 𝑑R, LR, 𝑚R⟩.
This leads to an answer to our ﬁrst question for the MP-axioms.
Theorem 221 (Problem 5, page 195 of [10]). The MP-plane R is a model of
the MP-axioms, which are therefore consistent.
To outline the description in [10] of all models of the MP-axioms, we need
an additional notion. We say that MP-planes
G = ⟨P; 𝑑, L, 𝑚⟩and G∗= ⟨P∗; 𝑑∗, L∗, 𝑚∗⟩
are MP-isomorphic if there is a bijection 𝜑: P →P∗, called an MP-
isomorphism, that preserves the three MP-primitive constructs, that is,
•
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑑∗(𝐴𝜑, 𝐵𝜑) for all 𝐴, 𝐵∈P,
•
a set ℓ⊆P is in L if and only if ℓ𝜑⊆P∗is in L∗and
•
𝑚(∠𝐴𝐵𝐶) = 𝑚∗(∠𝐴𝜑𝐵𝜑𝐶𝜑) for all angles ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶of G.
We think of MP-planes that are MP-isomorphic as being essentially the same.
In order to describe all models of the MP-axioms, we would like to identify a
set M of models with the property that no two models in M are isomorphic
to each other and every model is isomorphic to some model in M.
We can identify MP-isomorphisms by looking at a simpler notion. An
isometry from an MP-plane G to an MP-plane G∗is deﬁned in [10], page
275, to be a function 𝜑: P →P∗that preserves distance, that is,
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑑∗(𝐴𝜑, 𝐵𝜑)
for all 𝐴, 𝐵∈P. It turns out that preservation of distance guarantees preser-
vation of lines and angle measure as well.
Theorem 222 (Theorem 11.1.14 and Lemma 11.1.17 of [10]). Every isometry
from one model of the MP-axioms to another is an MP-isomorphism.
Millman and Parker answer our second question for the MP-axioms by
taking M = {R}, that is, by showing that R is essentially the only model of

8.2 Consistency
103
the MP-axioms. In general a set of axioms is said to be categorical if it has,
up to isomorphism, only one model.
Lemma 223 (Theorem 11.1.20 of [10]). Let G = ⟨P; 𝑑, L, 𝑚⟩be a model of
the MP-axioms, let 𝑂be a point of P and let ℓ1 and ℓ2 be two lines which
are perpendicular at 𝑂. Choose 𝐵∈ℓ1 and 𝐶∈ℓ2 so that 𝐵≠𝑂≠𝐶. Then
there is an isometry 𝜑from G to R such that 𝑂𝜑= (0, 0), that 𝐵𝜑= (𝑥, 0)
and 𝐶𝜑= (0, 𝑦) for some positive 𝑥, 𝑦∈R.
Theorem 224. The MP-axioms are categorical with R as a model that is
MP-isomorphic to every other model.
8.2 Consistency
We will use the consistency result of Theorem 221 to establish the consistency
of our axioms. Let
G = ⟨P; 𝑑, L, 𝑚⟩
be any model of the MP-axioms. We will show that the plane
G′ := ⟨P; 𝑑⟩
with the same set P of points and the same distance function 𝑑is a model
of our axioms. Since R is a model of the MP-axioms, it will follow that our
axioms are consistent with R′ as a model.
Having the distance function 𝑑on the set P of points, the deﬁnitions of the
deﬁned constructs in Chapters 1 through 7 immediately give us a meaning
of each of those deﬁned constructs in G′. In order to show that one of our
axioms holds in G′, we will ﬁrst need to verify that the constructs mentioned
in that axiom all have the same meanings in G′ as they have in G. It will then
follow that the axiom has the same meaning in both. If we can then show
that the axiom is provably true in G using the MP-axioms, it will follow that
it also holds in G′.
We begin doing this by observing that between has exactly the same deﬁ-
nition in G′ as in G. It follows that all terms we found in the previous section
to be deﬁned using only point, distance and between in this text exactly as
they are deﬁned in [10] must also have the same meaning in G′ as they have
in G. We list these terms together as
segment, ray, length, F+, circle, radius, inside and outside of a
circle, line, collinear, parallel lines, angle, triangle, sides of a line,
interior of an angle, inside of a triangle, triangular region.
This means, for example, that the same subsets of P are segments, rays or
triangles in G and in G′. A triangle has the same inside in G as in G′. The
same numbers are lengths of segments in G and in G′. Once we establish that

104
8 Consistency and Models
a term or phrase has the same meaning in G as it has in G′, we will use it freely
without needing to specify which plane we intend. If an axiom or theorem
uses only terms that have the same meaning in both planes, then it is true
in one plane if and only if it is true in the other. A number of our axioms use
only distance, between, length and the above other constructs that have the
same meaning in both planes. They give us a running start on what we need
to establish.
Lemma 225. The following axioms hold in G′: 2PA, 3PA, UNQ, INF, PSA,
RCA, EUC.
It remains to show that our other three axioms, CCA, LMA and SSS, also
hold in G′. The CCA is not explicitly stated in [10] but can be proven from
results in [10].
Lemma 226. The CCA holds in G′.
(The facts established in our Section 5.1 are all proven from the MP-axioms
in [10], as are both of the following.
•
Problem 10, page 159. Between any point inside a circle and any point
outside the circle there is a point on the circle.
•
Problem 3, page 165. If two circles each contain a point inside the other,
then they intersect in exactly two points.)
Because the ﬁnal axioms LMA and SSS both reference isometries, we will
need the following lemma.
Lemma 227. A function 𝜑: P →P is an isometry in G′ if and only if it is
an isometry in G.
Lemma 228. The LMA holds in G′.
(In [10], LMA(ii) is the deﬁnition of segment congruence and LMA(iii) is
Proposition 3.1.6.)
The triangle congruence axiom SSS will require more attention because
the notion of congruence is deﬁned very diﬀerently in G and G′. In [10] a
pair of segments are deﬁned to be congruent in G if they have the same
length measure (page 51) and a pair of angles are congruent if they have
the same angle measure (page 100). A pair of triangles are congruent in G
if their parts all have the same measure under some correspondence (page
116). In contrast our deﬁnition of congruence for G′ applies uniformly to any
two ﬁgures. They are congruent in G′ if some isometry of the entire plane
maps one onto the other.
In order to prove that SSS holds in G′, we will need to know that the same
triangles are congruent in G as in G′. To prove that that triangles congruent
in G are congruent in G′ means using the MP-axioms to produce the required
isometry from the fact that corresponding parts have the same measure.
Lemma 223 will give you a way to do this.

Lemma 229. Let △𝐴𝐵𝐶and △𝐷𝐸𝐹be triangles in G and G′. Then △𝐴𝐵𝐶
△𝐷𝐸𝐹in G′ if and only if △𝐴𝐵𝐶 △𝐷𝐸𝐹in G.
(Assume △𝐴𝐵𝐶 △𝐷𝐸𝐹in G as shown in Figure 8.1. Again you can use facts
in Section 5.1 as well as AAS that is Theorem 6.3.5 of [10]. Assume that 𝐶𝐵
and 𝐹𝐸are maximal length corresponding sides. Show that the feet 𝑂and
𝑃of the perpendiculars from 𝐴and 𝐷are between the two base points as
illustrated. Now use Lemma 223 to ﬁnd isometries 𝜑and 𝜓so that 𝜒:= 𝜓−1◦𝜑
is an isometry taking △𝐴𝐵𝑂onto △𝐷𝐸𝑃. Finally, show that 𝐶𝜒= 𝐹.)

As a consequence of Lemma 229, the two deﬁnitions of segment congruence
are also equivalent.

congruent in G′.
Lemma 231. The SSS axiom holds in G′.
(The SSS axiom is Theorem 6.2.3 of [10].)
Theorem 232. If G is a model of the MP-axioms, then G′ is a model of our
axioms.
Theorem 233. The real coordinate plane R′ is a model of our axioms, which
are therefore consistent.

106
8 Consistency and Models
Our proof that the real coordinate plane is a model of our axioms was
expedited by borrowing the work of Millman and Parker [10] and by the sim-
plicity of the axioms we used. The initial writing of this book was motivated
in part by the goal of demonstrating the consistency of the much more com-
plex and previously unvetted axioms used in [2]. Demonstrating that directly
would have been a signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult task. In Appendix B.10 we
will fulﬁll that goal by drawing on Theorem 233 and on the close connection
between [2] and this book.
8.3 Euclidean Fields
The inclusion of Birkhoﬀ’s Ruler and Protractor Postulates in the MP-axioms
makes those axioms restrictive to the point of having only the real coordinate
plane R, with points R2, as a model. We have seen that this model gives rise
to the corresponding model R′ of our axioms, also with R2 as its points.
These observations suggest that our axioms might have other models built
from other sets L of number like objects that use L2 as their points.
We have seen that measurement plays a central role in geometry. In order
that our planes support a theory of measurement, we would like L to have
basic algebraic features for computations and order features for comparing
sizes. This should include binary operations + and · (functions from L × L to
L), a binary relation < (a subset of L × L) and distinguished elements 0 ≠1
(in L). The set L forms a ﬁeld if
1. ⟨L; +, 0⟩is a commutative group,
2. ⟨L \ {0}; ·, 1⟩is a commutative group,
3. 𝑥· (𝑦+ 𝑧) = 𝑥· 𝑦+ 𝑥· 𝑧for all 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧∈L.
A ﬁeld L is an ordered ﬁeld if
4. ⟨L; <⟩is a linear ordering
and, for all 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧∈L with 𝑥< 𝑦,
5. 𝑥+ 𝑧< 𝑦+ 𝑧,
6. 𝑥· 𝑧< 𝑦· 𝑧if 𝑧> 0 and 𝑥· 𝑧> 𝑦· 𝑧if 𝑧< 0.
Properties (1) through (6) imply that the number 1 has inﬁnite order in the
group ⟨L; +⟩and therefore generates a copy Z of the integers within L.
Recall from Chapter 3 that the Archimedean Property of the real numbers
played a critical role in the proof Lemma 66(iii), which was used to prove
the Endomorphism Lemma 67 and the Scaling Theorem 78. They led to
the Similar Triangles Theorem 88 which was the key to the Pythagorean
Theorem 92 and to deﬁning area measure in Chapter 4. For these reasons
we will look for models of our axioms that are coordinate planes of ordered

8.3 Euclidean Fields
107
ﬁelds with the Archimedean Property. Thus we say that the ordered ﬁeld L
forms a number line (an Archimedean ordered ﬁeld) if
7. for every positive 𝑥∈L there is an integer 𝑛∈Z+ such that the rational
number 1
𝑛∈Q+ is less than 𝑥.
Lemma 234. An ordered ﬁeld L is Archimedean if and only if, for every
𝑥∈L, there is an integer 𝑛such that 𝑛−1 ≤𝑥< 𝑛.
We will review some standard facts about number lines that can be found,
for example, in the text [3], The Number Line through Guided Inquiry by
Clark and Xiao. Since every number line contains Z and is closed under
division, every number line contains the set Q of rational numbers as well.
Thus the rational number line is the unique smallest number line.
Using decimal notation we can give a uniform description of the numbers
in a number line. An inﬁnite decimal is any formal expression
±𝑛.𝑑1𝑑2𝑑3𝑑4 . . .
where ± is either + or −, where 𝑛is a non-negative integer and 𝑑1, 𝑑2, 𝑑3, 𝑑4, . . .
is a sequence of digits that does not end in repeating nines, with the sole ex-
ception of −0.0000 . . . that is not an inﬁnite decimal. If L is a number line
and the sequence ±𝑛, ±𝑛.𝑑1, ±𝑛.𝑑1𝑑2, . . . converges to a number 𝑥∈L, then
we can use the inﬁnite decimal ±𝑛.𝑑1𝑑2𝑑3𝑑4 . . . as a representation of the
number 𝑥. Theorem 56 of [3] says that every number in a number line L has
a unique inﬁnite decimal representation.
In this context another property of number lines becomes relevant. We say
that a number line L is complete if
8. every non-empty subset of L that has an upper bound has a least upper
bound.
It is not at all clear in advance that there really is a number line that is
complete. If a number line L is complete, then every inﬁnite decimal must
converge in L. Thus L would be represented by the set of all inﬁnite decimals.
In Chapter 8 of [3] it is shown that +, −, <, 0 and 1 can indeed be deﬁned on
the set R of all inﬁnite decimals to form a complete number line. We call
this the real number line. As a result every number line can be viewed
as a subﬁeld of the real numbers. For example, the rational number line Q
consists of all inﬁnite decimals that repeat in ﬁnite blocks from some point
onward ([3], Theorems 41 and 43).
The natural candidate for another model of our axioms beside the coor-
dinate plane R′ would be the rational coordinate plane Q whose points are
ordered pairs of rational numbers. Lines, circles and rays of Q could be de-
ﬁned as intersections of lines, circles and rays of R with Q2. Unfortunately
this idea fails at the very beginning.

108
8 Consistency and Models
Lemma 235. The Ray Circle Axiom (RCA) does not hold in the rational
coordinate plane Q.
Drawing on this experience with Lemma 235, we will add one ﬁnal restric-
tion on number lines to eliminate those that appear to fail in this way. We
say that a number line L is a Euclidean ﬁeld if
9. For each positive number 𝑥∈L, there is a number 𝑦∈L such that 𝑦2 = 𝑥.
We mention here three familiar and extensively studied Euclidean ﬁelds. The
completeness property (8) implies that every positive real number has a
square root ([3], Theorem 90). Consequently the set R of all real num-
bers forms a Euclidean ﬁeld. In Section 8.6 we will see that the ﬁeld C of
constructible numbers forms a Euclidean ﬁeld. As a third example, a real
number is algebraic if it is a root of some polynomial over the integers. The
theory of ﬁeld extensions tells us that the set A of all algebraic numbers forms
a subﬁeld of R. If 𝑎∈A is a positive root of a polynomial 𝑝(𝑥), then √𝑎is a
root of 𝑝(𝑥2) and is therefore in A. Thus the ﬁeld A of algebraic numbers
is a Euclidean ﬁeld.
It turns out that there are many more Euclidean ﬁelds. It follows from
Theorem 210 of [3], and is easy to verify, that a subset of R is a Euclidean
ﬁeld if and only if it contains 1 and is closed under under +, ·, −, −1 and √.
If S is any subset of R, let E(S) denote the set of all numbers in R obtainable
from S ∪{1} by a ﬁnite number of applications of +, ·, −, −1 and √. Then
E(S) is itself closed under these operations and contains 1, and is therefore a
Euclidean ﬁeld. Note that E(S) is countably inﬁnite if S is countably inﬁnite.
It follows that there is an abundance of Euclidean ﬁelds, even an abundance
of countably inﬁnite Euclidean ﬁelds. You can prove this by using the ﬁrst
uncountably inﬁnite ordinal ℵ1, which is the smallest uncountable cardinal.
Theorem 236. There is an uncountable sequence ⟨L𝛾| 𝛾< ℵ1⟩of countably
inﬁnite Euclidean subﬁelds of R, where L𝛾is properly contained in L𝛿if
𝛾< 𝛿< ℵ1.
The unique smallest Euclidean ﬁeld, E(∅), is the topic of our ﬁnal Section 8.6.
8.4 Models from Euclidean Fields
The goal of this section is to show that the restrictions we have imposed on
L to make it a Euclidean ﬁeld are suﬃcient to guarantee that its coordinate
plane will indeed be a model of our axioms. As you go through this section
you will see how each of those restrictions is called upon to prove one or
more of our axioms. It will follow from Theorem 236 that this will give us an
abundance of models. Our starting point is the real coordinate plane

8.4 Models from Euclidean Fields
109
R′ := ⟨R2; 𝑑R⟩,
which is a model of our axioms by Theorem 233. For each Euclidean ﬁeld
L ⊆R, we will denote by
C(L) := ⟨L2; 𝑑L⟩
the coordinate plane of L. Points of C(L) are the ordered pairs (𝑥, 𝑦) with
𝑥, 𝑦∈L. The distance function 𝑑L is the restriction of 𝑑R to L2. All other
constructs of C(L) are deﬁned from 𝑑L using the deﬁnitions given in Chapters
1 through 7. As an example, C(R) is R′. Our task is to show that C(L) is
also a model of our axioms.
We will ﬁrst show that each of the basic deﬁned constructs of C(L) is an
appropriate restriction of a corresponding construct of C(R). We say that
a segment of C(R) is an L-segment if it is 𝐴𝐵for some 𝐴, 𝐵∈L2. A ray
of C(R) is an L-ray if it is −−→
𝐴𝐵for some 𝐴, 𝐵∈L2. An angle of C(R) is an
L-angle if it is the union of two L-rays. A line of C(R) is an L-line if it is
←→
𝐴𝐵for some 𝐴, 𝐵∈L2. A triangle of C(R) is an L-triangle if its vertices are
all in L2. A circle of C(R) is an L-circle if its center is in L2 and its radius
is in L. An isometry of C(R) is an L-isometry if it takes L2 onto L2.
If 𝐴𝐵is an L-segment in C(R), then 𝐴𝐵L will denote the segment in C(L)
with endpoints 𝐴and 𝐵. Similarly, if U is an L-ray, an L-angle, an L-line,
an L-triangle, an L-circle or an L-isometry, UL will denote the corresponding
construct in C(L).
Lemma 237. Let L be a Euclidean ﬁeld. If U is an L-segment, an L-ray,
an L-angle, an L-line, an L-circle or an L-isometry, then UL = U ∩L2.
Conversely, for every segment, ray, line, angle, triangle or circle X in C(L),
there is a construct Y of the same type in C(R) for which YL = X.
Note that we have not included isometries in the converse. It is true that
every isometry of C(L) is the restriction of an isometry of C(R). But the
proof is much more involved and this fact is not required for what we need
to do here. Nearly half of our ten axioms can be seen to hold in C(L) from
just these observations.
Corollary 238. Each of the following axioms holds in C(L): 2PA, 3PA, UNQ,
INF, LMA(i,iii).
In general we need to use the fact that an axiom holds in C(R) to prove
that it holds in C(L). The axioms PSA, RCA, CCA and EUC all concern
the existence of points of intersection of lines and/or circles. Consequently
all four will follow immediately from the next theorem. As you prove it, note
that all three parts make use of the ﬁeld properties of L and that (ii) and (iii)
both require L to be a Euclidean ﬁeld.
Theorem 239. Let L be a Euclidean ﬁeld and let X and Y be subsets of
C(L) that are either

110
8 Consistency and Models
(i) two L-lines,
(ii) an L-line and an L-circle or
(iii) two L-circles.
Then the points of intersection of X and Y are all points of L2 and are
therefore the same as the points of intersection of XL and YL.
Corollary 240. Each of the following axioms holds in C(L): PSA, RCA,
CCA, EUC.
The remaining axioms, LMA(ii) and SSS, both involve congruence, deﬁned
in terms of isometries. Isometries of C(R) correspond to isometries of C(L)
provided that they are L-isometries. What we need here is a convenient way
to identify L-isometries. Recall that an L-isometry is an isometry of C(R)
that takes every point of L2 to a point of L2.
Lemma 241. If an isometry of C(R) takes two points of L2 to two points
of L2, then it takes every point of L2 to a point of L2.
Corollary 242. Both LMA(ii) and SSS hold in C(L).
We can now prove the main theorem of this section. If L is a ﬁeld, we
denote by L+ the set of positive numbers in L. If P is a plane, we will denote
by F+
P the set of lengths of segments in P.
Theorem 243. For every Euclidean ﬁeld L, the plane
C(L) := ⟨L2; 𝑑L⟩
is a model of our axioms with F+
C(L) = L+.
8.5 All Models
In Section 8.2 we answered the ﬁrst question posed in the introduction to this
chapter by showing that C(R) is a model of our axioms, which are therefore
consistent. In Section 8.4 we gave a partial answer to the second question,
Exactly which planes are models of our axioms?
by showing that the coordinate planes of all Euclidean ﬁelds are models.
We will now complete this answer by showing that coordinate planes of
Euclidean ﬁelds are the only models. In our context planes have only the
distance function 𝑑as a primitive construct. Consider planes
P = ⟨P; 𝑑⟩and P′ = ⟨P′; 𝑑′⟩.
Extending our prior terminology, we deﬁne an isometry from P to P′ to be
a bijection 𝛼: P →P′ that preserves distance, that is,

8.5 All Models
111
𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑑′(𝐴𝛼, 𝐵𝛼) for all 𝐴, 𝐵∈P.
Thus, in our geometry, an isomorphism is just an isometry. Planes P and P′
are isomorphic if there is an isometry from one to the other.
We would like to identify all of the models of our axioms as we did with
the MP-axioms in Section 8.1. This means ﬁnding a set M of models such
that no two models in M are isomorphic to each other and every model is
isomorphic to some model in M. We take
M := {C(L) | L is a Euclidean subﬁeld of R}.
In contrast to the MP-axioms, the next theorem tells us that this gives us a
very large collection of diﬀerent models.
Theorem 244. If K and L are two diﬀerent Euclidean subﬁelds of R, then
C(K) is not isomorphic to C(L). Consequently M contains at least ℵ1 pairwise
non-isomorphic countably inﬁnite models of our axioms.
(Suppose 𝛼: K2 →L2 is an isometry. Use Theorem 243 to show that F+
C(K) =
F+
C(L) and therefore K = L. Then apply Theorem 236.)
It remains to show that, for every model P of our axioms, there is a Eu-
clidean ﬁeld L such that P is isomorphic to C(L). Theorem 243 suggests that
we choose L to be the ﬁeld whose positive elements are F+
P. Accordingly, for
each model P of our axioms let −F+
P denote the negatives of the numbers
in F+
P, and let
LP := −F+
P ∪{0} ∪F+
P.
Lemma 245. If P is a model of our axioms, then LP is a Euclidean ﬁeld.
Theorem 246. If P is a model of our axioms, then P is isomorphic to the
coordinate plane C(LP) of the Euclidean ﬁeld LP.
(Choose any two perpendicular lines ℓ𝑋and ℓ𝑌of P intersecting at a point 𝑂.
Let 𝐼1 and 𝐼−1 be the two points of ℓ𝑋and let 𝐽1 and 𝐽−1 be the two points
of ℓ𝑌, all at distance one from 𝑂. For each 𝑧∈F+
P let 𝐼𝑧, 𝐼−𝑧, 𝐽𝑧and 𝐽−𝑧be,
respectively, the points on −−→
𝑂𝐼1, −−−→
𝑂𝐼−1, −−→
𝑂𝐽1 and −−−−→
𝑂𝐽−1 at distance 𝑧from 𝑂.
Now deﬁne 𝜑: P →C(L) as follows. For 𝐴∈P let 𝐴𝜑= (𝑥, 𝑦) where the line
through 𝐴parallel to ℓ𝑌intersects ℓ𝑋at the point 𝐼𝑥and the line through
𝐴parallel to ℓ𝑋intersects ℓ𝑌at the point 𝐽𝑦. Show that 𝜑is a bijection and
that, for all 𝐴, 𝐵∈C(L), we have 𝑑L(𝐴𝜑, 𝐵𝜑) = 𝑑(𝐴, 𝐵).)
Corollary 247. If P is model of our axioms that satisﬁes the Ruler Axiom,
then it is isomorphic to the real coordinate plane C(R).

8.6 The Constructible Plane
In this section we will see how valuable and interesting information can be
obtained from the coordinate plane of a Euclidean ﬁeld other than R. We
start by imagining a version of the real coordinate plane R2 in which only
the two points (0,0) and (1,0) are initially visible to us. We can make more
points and ﬁgures visible only by drawing them. We will assume the reader is
familiar with basic compass and straightedge constructions as are presented
in the ﬁrst chapter of [2].
We say that a point (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈R2 is constructible if there is a compass and
unmarked straightedge algorithm to draw two lines, a line and a circle or two
circles that intersect at (𝑥, 𝑦). For example, (1/2,
√
3/2) is constructible with
two applications of the compass. A real number is constructible if it is a
coordinate of a constructible point. We denote by C the set of all constructible
numbers. It is easy to verify that (𝑥, 𝑦) is a constructible point if and only if 𝑥
and 𝑦are both in C. Thus C2 is exactly the set of constructible points. Recall
from Section 8.3 that E(∅) is the minimal Euclidean ﬁeld that is contained in
every other Euclidean ﬁeld. We can now give a diﬀerent description of E(∅).
Lemma 248. C = E(∅).
Taking the distance function 𝑑C := 𝑑E(∅) gives us the alternative designa-
tion of the plane C(E(∅)) as
C(C) := ⟨C2; 𝑑C⟩.
This is known as the constructible plane. Its signiﬁcance was ﬁrst discov-
ered in the early nineteenth century by a group of French mathematicians,

8.6 The Constructible Plane
113
particularly ´Evariste Galois. The resulting Galois theory exposed deep con-
nections between ﬁeld theory, group theory and geometry. As one of many
applications of this theory, it provides important insights as to which num-
bers are and are not constructible. We will describe two of these applications
that are directly applicable to our work.
Since the Protractor Postulate holds in the plane R, the domain D of the
cosine function on R, deﬁned in Chapter 6, is the entire open interval (0, 90).
We will be interested in the real number cos(20). The following theorem of
Galois theory is proven using elementary facts about polynomial rings and
ﬁeld extensions, and is well exposited in many texts - for example - see [6],
[7] or [11].
Theorem 249. The number cos(20) is not constructible.
Outline of Proof. The ﬁrst step is to use dimensions of ﬁeld extensions to
prove that every constructible number is a root of an irreducible (not properly
factorable) polynomial over the rationals whose degree is a power of two, and
that every polynomial over the rationals having it as a root is a multiple of
that irreducible polynomial.
Next extend Theorem 180 by proving the sum formula for cosine:
cos(𝑥+ 𝑦) = cos(𝑥) cos(𝑦) −sin(𝑥) sin(𝑦).
Using this and the double angle formulas of Theorem 180 prove the triple
angle formula
cos(3𝑥) = 4 cos3(𝑥) −3 cos(𝑥).
Now apply this with 𝑥= 20 and simplify it to show that cos(20) is a root
of the polynomial 8𝑥3 −6𝑥−1. Using properties of the integers, verify that
this polynomial has no rational root. Since it is of degree three, it must be
irreducible over the rationals. Thus it is not a multiple of a polynomial of
degree a power of two so cos(20) is not constructible. □
We will give two examples of signiﬁcant applications of this fact.
The early Greeks were well aware of the applications of compass and
straightedge constructions as a means of demonstrating the existence of spe-
ciﬁc ﬁgures in the plane. These constructions remain valuable pedagogical
tools for beginning students of geometry, and are the topic of Section 1.3
of [2]. A typical construction gives a method to start with an arbitrary angle
and produce a ray that bisects it. Aware of this construction, the Greeks
raised an obvious question.
Is there a compass and straightedge method to trisect any angle?
After two thousand years of not succeeding in ﬁnding such a method, a sus-
picion arose that there just was no straightedge and compass method to do
this. But a demonstration that there was no method seemed equally elusive
until the early nineteenth century discovery of Theorem 249.

114
8 Consistency and Models
Theorem 250. There is no general compass and straightedge algorithm to
trisect an arbitrary angle in R.
The non-constructibility of cos(20) bears directly on Archimedes’ method
for measuring circles in Chapter 7 of [2] and in our Chapter 7. The technique
in both cases is to approximate a circle with 𝑛-sided regular polygons. We
took 𝑛to range over the powers of two starting with four, and demonstrated
the existence of regular 𝑛-gons for those values of 𝑛. In contrast, all values
of 𝑛greater than two were used in [2]. This leaves open another important
question.

Do all models of our axioms have a regular 𝑛-gon for every 𝑛> 2?
You can now answer this question.

does not contain a regular 9-gon.

Appendix A: Axioms
We list here the ten axioms used in this book for a Euclidean plane
P = ⟨P; 𝑑⟩.
I. Axioms for MCL#9 Foundational Principles

point 𝑃not on ℓ, there is at most one line containing 𝑃that is parallel
to ℓ.

Appendix B: MCL#9
This appendix is provided for the beneﬁt of users of the ﬁrst author’s prior
text [2]. Our preface describes the goals and methods of that book, which
covers the standard topics of high school geometry in a single undergraduate
guided inquiry course for teachers. It gives those teachers a solid working
understanding of what it means to establish a fact from given information
and a solid working knowledge of the topics they themselves will later need to
teach. However, achieving all of this in a single semester with students having
only a high school background in geometry required some compromises. In
this appendix we will give an outline of the conscious omissions and logical
gaps put into [2] and how they have been ﬁlled in this text.
1. Foundational Principles. The word geo-metry comes from the Greek
words for earth and measure and refers to the science of measurement of
physical space. From this point of view consider the following two statements.
1. The area of a circle of radius 𝑟is between 3.14158𝑟2 and 3.14160𝑟2.
2. A line containing a point inside a circle intersects the circle.
These statements are both true in the real Euclidean coordinate plane. But
they diﬀer in a signiﬁcant way. The ﬁrst would never have been discovered
without some very careful analysis of circles. In contrast, the second would
immediately be taken as a fundamental fact about lines and circles on a ﬂat
surface. Eighteenth century geometers were perplexed by this distinction, not
seeing any clear means to determine which statements required a proof and
which statements were obviously true of physical space.
Nevertheless, beginning students of geometry were quite willing to recog-
nize and respect this distinction without having any clear line drawn between
the two. As a result, Euclid’s geometry inspired a broad range of students
and scholars for well over two millennia. The goal of [2] was to give a for-
mulation of geometry that oﬀered the same beneﬁts of Euclid, but this time
with strategically chosen omissions together with the insights oﬀered by mod-
ern mathematics. The ﬁrst page of the ﬁrst chapter begins with a seemingly
innocuous statement and deﬁnition:

118
Appendix B: MCL#9
In plane geometry we study ﬁgures that can be drawn on a ﬂat
surface, like a sheet of paper. We say that a ﬁgure X is congruent
to a ﬁgure Y (written X  Y) if we can orient one, or a copy of
one, on top of the other so that they match exactly.
Clearly these are statements about physical space and ﬁgures in physical
space. In this informal setting beginning students learn to make reasonably
compelling arguments based on the imprecise information they have. After
Chapter 1 they transition to proving theorems using precise deﬁnitions and
axioms. Yet the initial context opens the opportunity to draw on what they
know about physical space at carefully chosen points along the way.
The unstated assumptions used by Euclid and [2] primarily fall into three
classes of simple statements whose validity in physical space would rarely be
questioned. We list them here with an example of each.
Non-triviality. For every line, there is a point not on that line.
Betweenness. Of three points on a line, one is between the other two.
Intersections. A ray from a point within a circle intersects the circle.
The preface of [2] labels these kinds of statements collectively as foundational
principles that students should be allowed to freely use without proof just
as students of Euclid had always done. Experience with [2] has shown this
strategy to work very well with the intended audience. But it did mean that [2]
fell far short of giving a full axiomatic development of high school geometry.
In particular the betweenness relation [...] is technically used as a primitive
construct, along with length, area and angle measure, although no governing
axioms for [...] are given. Thus a [2]-plane has four primitive constructs:
P = ⟨P; [...], L, A, D⟩.
Solution: The axioms given in our Chapter 1 include the LMA and SSS
from [2] and replace the Foundational Principles of [2] with seven Hilbert
style axioms about non-triviality, betweenness and intersections. It then gives
proofs of all of the foundational principles that will be needed later. One
additional axiom, EUC from [2], is given in Chapter 3. All other facts in
Chapters 1 to 7 can be proven from these axioms without any compromises.
2. Congruence. The notion of congruence is deﬁned transformationally in
Chapter 1 of [2] in terms of isometries. But isometries are only deﬁned in-
formally by referring to physical objects and physical actions. Later the SSS
and SAS axioms are given for triangle congruence. But no means is given of
proving congruence of ﬁgures other than triangles and their associated parts.
Yet it is intuitively clear, for example, that two circles with the same radius
should be congruent.
Solution: We say that ﬁgures are congruent if some isometry of the entire
plane takes one onto the other. This makes the notion of congruence applica-
ble to all ﬁgures rather than just a few isolated types. For example, it allows
us to prove statements like “Two circles are congruent if and only if they

Appendix B: MCL#9
119
have the same radius.” (Theorem 17) and “Two rectangles are congruent if
and only if their corresponding sides are congruent.” (Theorem 64) that do
not follow from the axioms of [2].
3. Real Numbers. College bound children normally enter high school with
a good working knowledge of the rational number system. In high school they
gradually learn about more numbers that are described in terms of a deﬁning
property rather than a numerical value, e.g.,
√
14, 𝜋,
√
14
𝜋, log10(23), sin(1.3), 𝑒, . . .
It may or may not be mentioned that most of these numbers are not rational;
they are just “numbers” that can be approximated by rational numbers. They
can be thought of as collectively forming a continuous whole called “the real
number line”. But no explanation is given as to what a real number is, much
less how to do arithmetic operations with real numbers.
They are unlikely to ever learn more about the real number system beyond
this in either high school or college unless they major in mathematics. Even
then, teachers may or may not have a course like [3] in which they will become
familiar with the real number system. And even those who do are unlikely to
take such a course before they take a course like [2] in geometry.
It was for this reason that Birkhoﬀ’s Ruler and Protractor postulates were
not mentioned in [2]. Speciﬁcally, the Length Measure Axiom (LMA) of [2] as-
serts the existence of a length measure function L that assigns every segment
𝐴𝐵to a positive number L(𝐴𝐵). But it intentionally refrains from invoking
Birkhoﬀ’s Ruler Postulate to conclude that every positive real number is the
length of some segment because the intended readers would have no idea
what that meant.
This left unanswered the question as to what the set F+
P of all lengths of
segments in a plane P could be. Is it necessarily the set R+ of all positive real
numbers? If not, what could it be?
Solution: Both questions are fully answered in Chapter 8. Theorem 246 says
that, for any model P of our axioms, the set F+
P is the set of all positive num-
bers in some Euclidean subﬁeld LP of the reals and that P is isomorphic to
the coordinate plane of LP. Conversely, Theorem 243 says that the coordi-
nate plane of every Euclidean ﬁeld L is a model of our axioms in which the
positive numbers in L are exactly the lengths of its segments.
Readers interested in Birkhoﬀ’s geometry do have the option to assume
the Ruler Postulate and read “F+” as “R+” throughout. This will simplify or
eliminate many parts of this text, particularly in Chapter 8.
4. Closed Regions. Chapter 3 of [2] on area measure begins with a brief
discussion of the kinds of ﬁgures that we will consider to have an area. These
ﬁgures are called closed regions, but that phrase is only explained by a draw-
ing of several examples. The measure of areas depends on the Area Measure

120
Appendix B: MCL#9
Axiom 6 of [2] that states properties of areas of closed regions. To legitimately
apply this axiom to a ﬁgure would require ﬁrst proving that the ﬁgure is a
closed region, and that is not possible without an exact deﬁnition of closed
region.
In order to give a full mathematical development, it would also be nec-
essary to deﬁne the measure function A and then prove that it has the
properties listed in Axiom 6 of [2].
Solution: Filling in these gaps has required not only adding further content,
but also required some reorganization of the content of [2]. We have done this
in two stages. In Chapter 4 we identify a limited class of closed regions, called
polygonal regions, deﬁne an area measure function A on those regions and
prove our Theorem 120 saying that it satisﬁes the ﬁrst three properties listed
in Axiom 6 of [2]. In our Chapter 7 we build on these results by deﬁning a
broader class of closed regions that includes both circular discs and polygonal
regions and an area function J that is an extension of A to that class of
regions. Doing this requires us to prove Theorem 199 saying that A satisﬁes
the fourth property listed in Axiom 6 as well.
Our deﬁnition of the area function A is built from the deﬁnition of the
area of a triangle with base 𝑏and height ℎ. The fact that all three choices
of 𝑏and ℎgive the same value for 𝑏ℎ/2 is an immediate consequence of the
Similar Triangles Theorem of [2], our Theorem 88, which is the culmination
of Chapter 5 in [2]. In order to apply this theorem to area measure, we have
changed the order of Chapters 3, 4, 5, giving us now ﬁrst Chapter 3: Similar
Figures, then Chapter 4: Area Measure and then Chapter 5: Angle Measure.
5. Rectangle Area Theorem. Area formulas for familiar polygons were
established in [2] from the rule for computing the area of a rectangle. This
rule was given as the Rectangle Area Theorem. Students were asked to prove
it in a very special case, and then use it in general without proof. Omitting
this proof saved considerable time but left a signiﬁcant gap that needed to
be ﬁlled.
Solution: The Rectangle Area Theorem is our Theorem 123.
6. Pythagorean Theorem. A classical proof of this theorem is given in [2]
that makes essential use of both area measure and angle measure. However,
this proof comes before the similarity chapter in [2] while our deﬁnition of
area begins with a critical application of the Similar Triangles Theorem 88 in
Lemma 102. Consequently we can not justify the proof in its location in [2].
Solution: We have resolved this problem by putting that proof after the
similarity, area measure and angle measure chapters as Theorem 175 since it
requires all three as background. Doing this led us to add Theorems 52, 92,
101 and 126 showing four other proofs and variations of this theorem, each
drawing on newly acquired background information.

Appendix B: MCL#9
121
7. Dilations. Like the deﬁnition of congruence, [2] used a transformational
deﬁnition of similarity based on the notion of a dilation. The dilation with
center 𝑂and scaling factor 𝑥∈R+ was deﬁned to be the transformation on
the set of all points taking 𝑂to itself and each point 𝑃≠𝑂to the point 𝑃′
on ray −−→
𝑂𝑃whose distance from 𝑂is 𝑥times the distance from 𝑂to 𝑃.
This deﬁnition immediately begs the question (not raised in [2]) as to
whether there really is a point 𝑃′ ∈−−→
𝑂𝑃at that distance from 𝑂. Birkhoﬀ’s
Ruler Postulate guarantees that such a point 𝑃exists for every positive
real number 𝑥. Since we do not use the Ruler Postulate, we must ask: For
which positive real numbers 𝑥are we guaranteed the existence of the required
point 𝑃′ for each choice of 𝑂and 𝑃?
Solution: Assume that 𝑂is a point and 𝑥is a positive real number such that,
for every point 𝑃≠𝑂, there is a point 𝑃′ ∈−−→
𝑂𝑃with L(𝑂𝑃′) = 𝑥L(𝑂𝑃). If
we take 𝑂𝑃to be a unit interval, then the length of 𝑂𝑃′ would be 𝑥1 = 𝑥.
Thus 𝑥∈F+. Conversely, we used the Endomorphism Lemma 67 to prove the
Scaling Lemma 69 saying that, for every 𝑥∈F+, every point 𝑂and every
point 𝑃≠𝑂, there does exist a point 𝑃′ on −−→
𝑂𝑃such that the length of 𝑂𝑃′
is 𝑥times the length of 𝑂𝑃. Thus the scaling factors for dilations are exactly
the numbers in F+.
8. Angle Measure. Chapter 6 of [2] presents the trigonometry of acute
angles and uses it to ﬁnd missing measurements in an assortment of partially
speciﬁed triangles. If the length of a side or the degree measure of an angle
is speciﬁed, it is necessary to ask if there really is a segment or angle with
that measurement in the plane. This issue is not mentioned in [2]. It does not
directly concern the development in this book, but is relevant to the context
that this book presents.
Solution: On page 71 of Chapter 6 we have addressed this issue. There we
explain how Birkhoﬀ’s Ruler and Protractor Postulates will guarantee the
presence of these segments and angles by restricting the models of the axioms
to only the real number coordinate plane. There we also prove Theorem 178
saying that, in our context, the Ruler Postulate alone is suﬃcient since it
implies the Protractor Postulate.
In Chapter 8 we saw that our weaker axioms embrace many more models.
Theorem 244 implies that there are many countably inﬁnite models of our
axioms in which the set of angle measures is countably inﬁnite and therefore
not all of the open interval (0,180). Theorem 249 gives a speciﬁc model which
does not contain an angle with degree measure 20.
9. Circles. Chapter 7 of [2] used Archimedes method of approximating circles
with regular circumscribed polygons to ﬁnd the circumference and area of a
circle. This required establishing four assertions.

122
Appendix B: MCL#9
(i) The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of any two circles is the
same.
(ii) The ratio of the area to the square of the radius of any two circles is
the same.
(iii) Those two ratios are the same number, denoted by the Greek letter 𝜋.
The circumference 𝑐and the area 𝑎of any circle of radius 𝑟are given
by 𝑐= 2𝜋𝑟and 𝑎= 𝜋𝑟2.
(iv) The value of 𝜋is given by 𝜋= lim𝑛→∞𝑛tan   90
𝑛
.
Compelling arguments using diagrams and experimental calculations were
given in [2] for each of these. Although they are intuitively appealing adap-
tations of Archimedes work, none of these arguments rise to the level of a
proof since several items are missing:
1. a demonstration that the required polygons actually exist,
2. a deﬁnition of circumference for (i) and (iii),
3. a deﬁnition of circle area for (ii) and (iii) and
4. a deﬁnition of 𝜋for (iii) and (iv).
Solution: In our Chapter 7 we ﬁll in each of these four gaps and give complete
proofs of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) as follows.
1. For each positive integer 𝑛we deﬁne the inscribed convex 2𝑛+1-gon I𝑛
in Section 7.2 and the circumscribed convex 2𝑛+1-gon O𝑛in Section 7.3.
2. The circumference of a circle is deﬁned on page 98.
3. The area of a circle is deﬁned on page 89 as the Jordan measure of the
corresponding closed disk, provided that closed disk is Jordan measur-

4. The number 𝜋is deﬁned in Theorem 212.
Theorems 219 and 220 together show that the ratios in (i) and (ii) are both
𝜋by establishing the formulas of (iii). Item (iv) is Theorem 212.
10. Consistency. Do the axioms used in [2] lead to a consistent theory of
geometry, that is, do they have a model?
Solution: In Chapter 8 we answered this question aﬃrmatively for our ax-
ioms. We will now use the results of Chapter 8 to show that the answer is also
aﬃrmative for the [2]-axioms. We do this by showing that each model P of
our axioms, as described in Section 8.5, leads to a model P∗of the [2]-axioms
with the same set of points. To do this we start with any model P = ⟨P; 𝑑⟩
of our axioms. Using P we take
P∗= ⟨P; [...], L, A, D⟩
to be the [2]-plane with its four primitive constructs deﬁned as they are in
P starting with the distance function 𝑑. Appendix E gives page numbers for
each of these deﬁnitions.

Appendix B: MCL#9
123
We would like to show that P∗is a model of the [2]-axioms, including the
three unproven theorems used in [2] as further axioms. In order to do that
we ﬁrst need to recognize that [2] falls short of oﬀering a proper axiomatic
theory because it uses ﬁve terms or phrases that are not carefully speciﬁed:
isometry, congruent ﬁgures, closed region, scaling factor, dilation.
Congruence is deﬁned in [2] in terms of physical actions as we quote in item
1. Foundational Principles above. Isometries are those physical actions (page
4). Closed regions, whose areas are to be found, are deﬁned by drawings of
several examples (page 29). Dilations are deﬁned by scaling factors (page 51),
but nothing is said about which positive real numbers are scaling factors. In
order to give a valid interpretation to the axioms and theorems of [2], we
recast each of these terms as a deﬁned notion as they are in this text.
1. An isometry is a distance preserving bijection.
2. Figures X and Y to congruent if some isometry takes one onto the
other.
3. A closed region is a polygonal region. In Chapter 7 we expand the
deﬁnition to include all Jordan measurable ﬁgures.
4. A scaling factor is a number in F+.
5. A dilation for each scaling factor is deﬁned as we have in Chapter 3.
With these adjustments the axioms and theorems of [2] become well for-
mulated mathematical statements that have the same meaning in P∗as they
have in P. Consequently we can demonstrate that the [2]-axioms are true in
P∗by proving them true in P. Appendix D gives a full listing of the axioms
and theorems in [2] together with the axiom or theorem of this book that
establishes that they are true in P. Since this list includes the axioms of [2],
each model P of our axioms described in Section 8.5 corresponds to a model
P∗of the [2]-axioms with the same set P of points. In particular, the axioms
of [2] are consistent.

Appendix D: Theorem Index
Our Chapters 1 through 7 give a full axiomatic development of the topics of
high school plane geometry that parallels the more elementary development
of those same topics in Chapters 1 through 7 of [2]. This index lists all items
from those chapters of [2] that take part in its axiomatic development. Each
of these listings is followed by the item in the present text where that result is
established, thereby showing that the facts presented in [2] can all be proven
from our axioms. Chapter numbers refer to [2].
