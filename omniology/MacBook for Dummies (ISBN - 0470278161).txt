About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for 25 years — pushing computers and 
their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for decades now. His fi rst 
love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 1984 when he bought his 
lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now he spends entirely too 
much time on the Internet and drinks far too much caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State University, 
Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. After fi ve years 
as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, however, he decided there must 
be a better way to earn a living — and he became the Documentation Manager 
for Datastorm Technologies, a well-known communications software developer. 
Somewhere in between designing and writing software manuals, Mark began writ-
ing computer how-to books. His fi rst book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published 
in 1994 — and after a short decade or so of fun (disguised as hard work), Mark is 
one of the most productive and best-selling technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers throw 
at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, designing and 
teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — for Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis 
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest com-
puter games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3-D fl ights of fancy with 
TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of music 
imaginable. Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at www.
mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, including 
everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition; 
Mac OS X Leopard All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies; Building a PC For 
Dummies, 5th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition; CD & DVD Recording 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 3rd 
Edition; Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simpliﬁ ed Tips & Tricks; Microsoft Ofﬁ ce v. X
Power User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and CDs; The 
Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Printer Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial 
Recordable CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Digital Photography 
Handbook; Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; Teach Yourself the 
iMac Visually; Running a Perfect BBS; Ofﬁ cial Netscape Guide to Web Animation; 
and the Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little Black Book.
His books have been translated into 16 languages so far — his favorites are 
German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read them, he enjoys 
the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at mark

Dedication
This book is dedicated to Jody Cooper, a true friend who just won’t quit — 
whether he’s elbow-deep in a computer chassis or dancing the Time Warp in 
front of the Silver Goddess. May our friendship last another 20 years . . . and 
longer!
Author’s Acknowledgments
It hit me right in the middle of this project — while writing a book about 
Apple’s well-designed Macintosh laptops and software, I had the “best-
designed” people in the technology publishing business working alongside 
me! These folks made sure that what you read is accurate, funny, and easy to 
understand.
Coincidence? I think not. That’s the Wiley Way.
First, I’d like to thank my technical editor, Greg Willmore, whose expert 
knowledge of Apple hardware and software ensured that I didn’t get FireWire 
400 mixed up with FireWire 800. I owe a huge debt of gratitude as well to my 
hardworking senior copy editor, Teresa Artman, who once again provided 
the perfect combination of an eagle eye and a welcome sense of humor!
As with every book I’ve written, I’d like to thank my wife, Anne; and my chil-
dren, Erin, Chelsea, and Rose; for their support and love — and for letting me 
follow my dream!
Finally, I need to send my heartfelt thanks — once again — to two wonderful 
editors at Wiley: my project editor, Mark Enochs, and my acquisitions editor, 
Bob Woerner. A book like this wouldn’t be possible without the patience, 
guidance, and hard work that Mark and Bob provide . . . and they’re great 
friends as well. It’s win-win!

MacBook For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
L
aptop owners are special people.
You see, a laptop owner demands everything from a computer that a desktop 
owner does: reliability, performance, expandability, and ease of use. Owners 
of Mac Pro or iMac desktop computers can draw the line right there because 
their computers are designed for a stationary existence. But, you and I are 
laptop owners. We also need that same computer to be an inch thick (or 
less). We demand that it run for hours on a single battery charge. We require 
that it be light as a feather.
Today’s Apple laptops deliver all that, and more! If you’ve bought one of 
these modern masterpieces — or you’re thinking about it right now — I 
applaud your good taste, common sense, and discerning eye. Apple laptops 
have everything: super performance, a top-shelf LCD screen, rugged reli-
ability, and a trouble-free, powerful operating system. Heck, your Intel-based 
Apple laptop can even run . . . wait for it . . . Windows XP or Vista. (If you 
absolutely have to, the option is there.)
I wrote this book for myself — and for every other Apple laptop owner who 
desires to become a laptop techno-wizard. In these pages, you find a guide 
to both your laptop’s hardware and Mac OS X Leopard, the latest version of 
Apple’s superb operating system. After I cover the basics that every laptop 
owner should know, you find out how to accomplish all sorts of cutting-edge 
audio, visual, and Internet projects. (Oh, and if you already have another of 
my books, you know that I don’t skimp on the power user tips and tricks that 
save you time, effort, and money.)
Like my dozen-or-so other For Dummies titles, I respect and use the same 
English language you learned in school, avoiding jargon, ridiculous computer 
acronyms, and confusing techno-babble whenever possible. (Plus, I try to 
bring out the humor that’s hidden inside every computer. Finding out how to 
use your Mac should be fun, and not a chore!)
What’s Really Required
If you’re not an engineer with a degree in Advanced Thakamology — imagine 
that — there’s no need to worry! Here’s a reasonably complete list of what’s 
not required to use this book.

2
MacBook For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
 I make no assumptions about your previous knowledge of computers — 
laptop or otherwise — and software. I start at the beginning, which is 
where every book should start.
 
 Still considering buying a MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro? 
Heck, you don’t even need the computer! If you’re evaluating whether a 
Mac laptop is right for you, this book is a great choice. I introduce you 
to both the hardware and software you’ll get, so you can easily deter-
mine whether a Mac is the machine for you. (It is. Trust me.)
 
 Upgrading from the monster that is Windows? I have tips, tricks, and 
entire sections devoted to the hardy pioneers called Switchers! You 
discover the similarities and differences between the two operating sys-
tems, how you can make the switch as easy and quick as possible, and 
how to run Windows on your new laptop, if you absolutely must.
 
 If your friends and family have told you that you’re going to spend half 
your savings on software — or that there’s no decent software available 
for Mac computers — just smile quietly to yourself! These are two per-
sistent myths about Mac computers, and those same folks are going to 
be blown away by the images, music, movies, and documents you pro-
duce. (Oh, by the way, your Mac laptop comes complete with a ton more 
software than any other PC or laptop, and the iLife suite of applications 
is better than anything available on a PC!) To sum up: You can do virtu-
ally everything in this book with the software that came with your Mac!
So what is required? Only your Mac laptop and the desire to become a power 
user — someone who produces the best work in the least amount of time and 
has the most fun doing it!
This book was written using the latest MacBook Pro computer, so owners of 
older Mac laptops who aren’t running Intel processors might not be able to 
follow along with everything I cover. However, if you’ve upgraded an older G4 
laptop with Mac OS X Leopard and the iLife ’08 application suite, you should 
be able to use most of the book with no problem.
About This Book
Each chapter in this book is written as a reference on a specific hardware or 
software topic. As fruit of the hard work of my editors, you can begin reading 
anywhere you like because each chapter is self-contained. However, if you 
want to get the most out of this tome (and your MacBook experience), noth-
ing’s wrong with reading this book from front to back. I warn you, however, 
that Tom Clancy and Stephen King have nothing to fear from my “no-frills” 
prose.

 Introduction
Conventions Used in This Book
Even with a minimum of techno-speak, this book needs to cover the special 
keys you have to press or menu commands you have to choose to make 
things work. Hence, this short list of conventions.
Stuff you type
I may ask you to type a command in Mac OS X. That text often appears like this:
Type me.
 
You usually have to press the Return key before anything happens.
Menu commands
I list menu commands, using this format:
Edit➪Copy
This example of shorthand menu instruction indicates that you should click 
the Edit menu and then choose the Copy menu item.
Web addresses
No up-to-date book on a computer is complete without a bag full of Web 
addresses for you to check out. When you see these in the text, they look like 
this — www.mlcbooks.com — or like this:
www.mlcbooks.com
(By the way, that Web site does exist. You’re always welcome to check out 
my little acre of Web space!)
For the technically curious
Your MacBook is an elegant and sophisticated 
machine — and as easy to use as a computer 
can be — but from time to time, you may be 
curious about the technical details surround-
ing your hardware and software. (You probably 
disassembled alarm clocks as a kid, like I did.) 
Techie stuff is formatted as a sidebar, like this 
one, and you don’t have to read it unless you 
want to know what makes things tick. (Pun by 
sheer accident.)

MacBook For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
How This Book Is Organized
After careful thought (read that “flipping a coin”), I divided this book into 
seven major parts — plus an index, just because you deserve one. For your 
convenience, cross-references to additional coverage of many topics are 
sprinkled liberally throughout the book.
The Seven Parts Shall Be As Follows.
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? 
Preposterous!
This part introduces you to the important features of your laptop — like find-
ing out where all the cables connect — and helps you set up your system. I 
also introduce Mac OS X Leopard, which is the Apple operating system that 
comes preinstalled on your MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro.
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X
Time to familiarize you with Leopard (there’s much more here behind the 
spots). In Part II, you find out how to take care of mundane chores (such as 
moving your stuff) as well as how to customize and personalize your system 
until it fits like the proverbial glove. Switchers from the PC world will be 
especially interested in understanding the ins and outs of Mac OS X — and 
friends, it ain’t hard. The Mac started out easier to use than a Windows PC, 
and nothing has changed.
Part III: Connecting and Communicating
In Part III, it’s time to jump into the one application you’re likely to use every 
day: your Safari Web browser! You also find out more about the Apple .Mac 
Internet subscriber service as well as how to connect your laptop for print-
ing, sharing information with your PDA or cellphone, and even videoconfer-
encing. (I told you this thing was powerful, didn’t I?)
Part IV: Living the iLife
Ah, readers, you can begin humming happily to yourself right this second! 
Yep, Part IV provides complete coverage of the latest iLife ’08 release, with 
the names that are the envy of the Windows crowd: iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, 

5
 Introduction
iDVD, and GarageBand. You find out how to turn your mobile monster com-
puter into the hub for all your digital media. Whether you listen to it, display 
it, compose it, or direct it, this part of the book will explain it.
Part V: Sharing Access and Information
In Part V, I discuss how to share your Mac laptop among a group of people 
and also how to connect your Mac to a network. (Wired or wireless, makes 
no difference to me!) I also cover how to share data among wireless devices 
using Bluetooth technology and iSync, and how to broadcast your music 
around your house like Wolfman Jack.
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, 
Upgrading, Maintaining
In Part VI, I cover the stuff my Dad used to call the Justin Case Guide — that 
is, just in case, you want to upgrade your MacBook with more memory or 
new hardware. If you need to troubleshoot a problem with your hardware or 
software, check out my should-be-patented troubleshooting guide. Finally, I 
describe what you can do to help keep your Mac running as fast and as trou-
ble-free as the day you took it out of the box!
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The two chapters here that make up the famous “Part of Tens” section con-
tain a quick reference of tips and advice on a specific laptop or Macintosh 
topic. Each list has ten concise tips, and one or two readers have told me 
that they make excellent tattoos. (Personally, I’m not that much of a Mac 
guru.)
Icons Used in This Book
Like other technology authors, I firmly believe that important nuggets of 
wisdom should stand out on the page! With that in mind, this For Dummies 
book includes a number of margin icons for certain situations.
 
The most popular icon in the book, you find it next to suggestions I make that 
save you time and effort — and once or twice, even cash!

6
MacBook For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
These are My Favorite Recommendations — in fact, I’ll bet just about any 
laptop power user would tell you the same. Follow my Maxims, and you’ll 
avoid the quicksand and pitfalls that I’ve encountered with all sorts of Macs 
for well over a decade!
 
You don’t have to know this stuff, but the technologically curious love high-
tech details. (Of course, we’re great fun at parties, too.)
 
Always read the information for this icon first! I’m discussing something that 
could harm your hardware or throw a plumber’s helper into your software.
 
The highlighter stuff — not quite as universally accepted (or as important to 
the author) as a Mark’s Maxim, but a good reminder! I use these icons to rein-
force That Which Should Be Remembered.
Where to Go from Here
My recommendations on how to proceed? I just happen to have three:
 
 If you’re thinking about buying a new MacBook, MacBook Air, or 
MacBook Pro, the box is still unopened in your living room, or you’d like 
help setting things up, start with Part I.
 
 If you’re already on the road with your laptop but you’d like guidance 
with running Mac OS X — Hey, you Windows Switchers! Take note! — 
start with Part II.
 
 For all other concerns, use the index or check out the table of contents 
to jump straight to the chapter you need.
A Final Word
I thank you for buying my book, and I hope that you find MacBook For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition invaluable! With this fearless guide in hand, I believe 
that you and your Mac will bond as I have with mine. (That sounds somewhat 
wrong, but it’s really not.)
Time for the first Mark’s Maxim in this book:
 
Take your time — after all, finding out how to use your computer isn’t a race — 
and don’t worry if you’re not a graphic artist, professional photographer, or 
video editor. With your Mac laptop and its software, you don’t have to be!™

Part I
Tie Myself Down 
with a Desktop? 
Preposterous!

In this part . . .
Your journey as a Mac Road Warrior — pun intended — 
begins with a description of your laptop itself as 
well as the details you need to know when unpacking and 
setting up your newest family member. You’ll also fi nd an 
introduction to Mac OS X Leopard, the latest version of 
Apple’s super-popular operating system.
I also talk about the differences between the MacBook 
models as of this writing: the MacBook, MacBook Pro, and 
the incredibly thin MacBook Air.

Chapter 1
Hey, It Really Does Have 
Ever y thing I Need
In This Chapter
 Identifying the important parts of your Mac laptop
 Introducing the MacBook Air
 Locating the right home for your computer
 Plugging in stuff and getting hooked up
 Playing with your bundled software
 Buying additional stuff that you might need
M
ost action films have one scene in common: I call it the “gear up” 
scene, where the good guys strap on their equipment in preparation 
for battle. (It doesn’t matter what era: You see “gear up” scenes in Gladiator, 
Aliens, and virtually every movie Arnold has made.) You’re sure to see lots 
of clicking straps and equipping of offensive weapons (and sometimes even 
a dash of war paint. The process usually takes a minute or so, all told with 
whiplash camera work and stirring martial music in the background.
Well, fellow Macintosh Road Warrior, it takes only two seconds and one move 
for you to gear up: closing the lid. That’s because your MacBook is a self-
contained world, providing virtually everything you’ll find on a desktop iMac 
or Mac Pro. This is indeed the decade of the laptop, meshing nicely with your 
cellphone and that wireless connection at your local coffee shop. You have 
selected the right companion for the open road.
Unlike some of Apple’s other designs, such as the Mac Mini or the iMac, your 
MacBook looks similar to a PC laptop running Windows. (In fact, an Intel-
based Mac laptop can run Windows, if you absolutely must.) But your laptop 
holds a number of pleasant surprises that no PC laptop can offer — and, in 
the case of the MacBook Air, you’ll lose pounds and inches from your chas-
sis! In this chapter, I introduce you to the hardware and all the major parts 

10
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
of the machine — and you’ll even find out how to unpack and connect your 
computer. And, as frosting on the cake, I’ll preview the software that Apple 
is so proud of, as well as the accessories that you should buy now instead of 
later.
Welcome to your Mac laptop, good reader. Gear up!
An Overview of Your Mac Laptop
Sure, your MacBook Pro might be but an inch thin (and a MacBook Air even 
more svelte than that — I get to that later in the chapter), but a lot of superb 
design lives inside, and you’ll encounter the same parts that you’d find in a 
desktop machine. In this section, I discuss those important parts — both the 
stuff you can see and the stuff that’s shoehorned within.
The parts you probably recognize
Every laptop requires some of the same gizmos. Figure 1-1 helps you track 
them down. Of course, as you’d expect, a computer has a body of sorts in 
which all the innards and brains are stored, a display screen, a keyboard, a 
trackpad or other pointing device, and ports for powering and exchanging 
data with outside toys.

 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
That magnificent screen
What a view you have! Today’s Mac laptops feature a 13", 15", or 17" LCD dis-
play. Most displays are available in glossy or standard finish: The former is 
a good choice for the brightest colors and deepest blacks, and the latter is a 
good choice where reflections might be a problem.
 
LCD screens use far less electricity than their antique CRT ancestors do, and 
they emit practically no radiation.
Apple’s laptop screens offer a widescreen aspect ratio (the screen is consid-
erably wider than it is tall), which augurs well for those who enjoy watching 
DVD movies. (A favorite editor of mine loves it when I use the antique word 
augur, meaning to predict or foretell.)
 
That reminds me: Throw away your printed dictionary! You won’t need it 
because Mac OS X Leopard includes the fantastic Dictionary widget, which 
uses the Internet to retrieve definitions from the online Oxford American 
Dictionary site. More on widgets in general in Chapter 5 . . . and yes, it does 
contain augur.
Feeling outdated? Never!
Are you using an older MacBook, iBook, or 
PowerBook? It seems that Apple’s product line 
changes every time you tear a page from your 
12-month calendar, and every new generation 
of laptops includes new whiz-bang features. 
Sometimes you can add those features sepa-
rately to your older machine — such as an 
external iSight camera or an AirPort Extreme 
card — but you can’t update some things, such 
as like your iBook motherboard. Sigh.
Here’s my take on this situation: If your older 
laptop does what you need at a pace you can 
accept, there is no need to upgrade it. 
Skeptical? Here’s the proof: Before my recent 
upgrade to a MacBook Pro, yours truly was 
lugging a pristine iBook G3, which booted Mac 
OS X Tiger and did absolutely everything that I 
demanded. (A little more patience was required, 
certainly, but technology authors are simply 
brimming with patience.) The moral: Avoid the 
upgrade fever unless you really need a new 
companion!
If your laptop bears the iBook or PowerBook 
logo, you can still enjoy this book and dis-
cover new tips and tricks from it! Unless the 
new breed of Intel-based Mac laptops has a 
feature that you absolutely can’t use on your 
iBook (such as booting directly into Windows), 
you can sail on with your current computer, 
fiercely proud of The Bitten Apple that appears 
on the cover. Although this book was written 
with the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook 
Pro lines in mind, virtually everything you read 
here still applies to your older laptop. Unless it’s 
steam-driven, of course.

12
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
The keyboard and trackpad
Hey, here’s something novel for your laptop. Unlike the external input 
devices on a standard desktop computer, your Mac has a built-in keyboard 
and trackpad (which does the job of a mouse). The keyboard is a particular 
favorite of mine for a few reasons:
 
 You can either control the sound volume or mute all that noise completely.
 
 You can use illuminated keyboards (at least on high-end Mac laptops), 
which are perfect for darkened dorm rooms and airplane flights.
 
 A handy-dandy Media Eject key lets you eject a CD or DVD.
The disc slot
You’ll notice a long groove at the bottom-right corner of your MacBook or 
MacBook Pro. No, it’s not for your credit card. This slot accepts CDs and 
DVDs into your optical drive. If the drive is empty, loading a disc is as simple 
as sliding it in an inch or so; the drive sucks in the disc automatically. (And 
we don’t need a stinkin’ floppy. Macs haven’t had floppy drives for years 
now, and the PC types are just beginning to follow.)
 
A MacBook Air doesn’t sport any internal optical drive (more on the MacBook 
Air later in this chapter). You use either the CD & DVD Sharing feature in 
Leopard to read discs remotely (from another Mac or PC on your network), or 
you can pick up an external optical drive from Apple for about $100. (Such is 
the price you play for super-thin and super-light.)
 
“Luke, the printed label side of the disc should always be facing you when you 
load a disc. Always.”
Food for your ears
A machine this nice had better have great sound, and the Mac doesn’t disap-
point. You have a couple of options for Mac laptop audio:
 
 All Mac laptops sport built-in speakers (and a microphone to boot). 
The MacBook Air has a single speaker, and MacBook and MacBook Pro 
models sport stereo speakers.
 
 Use built-in audio Line Out jacks to connect your Mac’s audio to a pair 
of headphones, or a more powerful (and expensive) external speaker 
system, or a home stereo system.
The power cable
Sorry, can’t get a wireless power system . . . yet. (Apple’s working hard on 
that one.) However, the MacBook Pro was the first major release of a laptop 
with a magnetic power connector; the MacBook and MacBook Air followed 

13
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
suit soon after. The MagSafe connector reduces the chances of your pride 
and joy being yanked off a desk when someone trips over the power cord, 
because the magnetic closure pops off under significant strain. Now that’s 
sassy.
The power button
Yep, you have one of these, too. It’s on the upper right, next to the keyboard, 
bearing the familiar “circle with a vertical line” logo.
The iSight camera
Check out that tiny square lens above your screen. That’s a built-in iSight 
camera, which allows you to chat with others in a videoconferencing environ-
ment using Leopard’s iChat feature. You can even take photos with it, using 
the Photo Booth software that comes with your laptop, or set up a travelin’ 
Webcam.
The battery compartment
Owners of a MacBook or MacBook Pro can open the cover on the bottom of 
the laptop to switch batteries. Many road warriors who constantly use their 
laptops for extended periods swear by extra batteries, especially if they’re 
on-site in the middle of nowhere and there’s not an AC outlet to be found.
Of course, your laptop automatically charges the battery while it’s plugged 
in, so you shouldn’t have to remove the battery unless you’re replacing it or 
switching it with another battery.
If you’re using a MacBook Air, your battery is sealed inside the case and 
can’t be swapped. Only an Apple technician can replace a dead battery in a 
MacBook Air laptop.
Hey, where’s my remote?
If this isn’t your first Mac laptop, you’re prob-
ably looking for the Apple Remote amongst all 
the Styrofoam. Unfortunately, the latest crop 
of Mac laptops don’t come with a remote. This 
once-standard device, which looks like an iPod 
Shuffle, allowed you to control your laptop wire-
less from across the room. Think DVD viewings, 
presentations, and lazy iTunes listening.
If you’ve picked up a used MacBook or 
MacBook Pro, you might have a remote already. 
Otherwise, you can always buy one directly 
from Apple for about $20. However, you can’t 
use an Apple Remote with the MacBook Air, 
which doesn’t have an IR (infrared) receiver.

14
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
The holes called ports
The next stop on your tour of Planet Laptop is Port Central — those rows of 
holes on the sides of your computer. Each port connects a different type of 
cable or device, allowing you to easily add all sorts of functionality to your 
computer.
Each of these stellar holes is identified by an icon to help you identify it. 
Here’s a list of what you’ll find, and a quick rundown on what these ports do.
Connections for external devices and networking:
 
 FireWire: These ports are the standard in the Apple universe for con-
necting external hard drives and DVD recorders, but they do double-
duty as the connector of choice for peripherals like your digital video 
(DV) camcorder. (A peripheral is another silly techno-nerd term that 
means a separate device you connect to your computer.) Depending 
on the model of laptop you chose, you’ll have one of the older FireWire 
400 ports, and you may also have a much faster FireWire 800 port. (The 
MacBook Air doesn’t have a FireWire port.)
 
 USB: Short for Universal Serial Bus, the familiar USB port is the jack-of-
all-trades in today’s world of computer add-ons. Most external devices 
that you want to connect to your laptop (such as portable hard drives, 
scanners, and digital cameras) use a USB port, including the iPod. 
Depending on the model of laptop, you’ll have either two or three USB 
2.0 ports available. USB 2.0 connections are much faster than the old 
USB 1.1 standard, but they still accept USB 1.1 devices running at the 
slower speed.
 
 Get the lowdown on FireWire and USB ports in Chapter 20.
 
 Ethernet: Today’s Mac laptops include a standard 10/100/1000 Ethernet 
port, so the laptop is ready to join your existing wired Ethernet network. 
(Alternatively, you can go wireless for your network connection; more 
on that in the next section and in Chapters 17 and 20.) Because the 
MacBook Air is designed to be completely wireless, it doesn’t have a 
wired Ethernet port — if necessary, you can add a USB Ethernet adapter 
to add a wired network port to your Air.
 
 ExpressCard/34: When you need the absolute fastest performance 
possible from an external device, you can connect that device to your 
laptop by using the ExpressCard slot. These cards are the descen-
dants of the popular PCMCIA (or PC Card) cards, which many models 
of older Mac PowerBooks can use. The MacBook Air doesn’t have an 
ExpressCard slot.

15
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
Connections for external video and audio are
 
 VGA/DVI connector: In case that splendid screen isn’t big enough, you 
can buy an adapter for this port that allows you to send the video signal 
from your laptop to another VGA or DVI monitor, or even S-Video output 
for your TV and VCR.
 
 Headphone/Optical Output: You can send the high-quality audio from 
your rectangular beast to a set of standard headphones or an optical 
digital audio device such as a high-end home theater system.
 
 Optical Line In: Last (but certainly not least) is the optical audio Line In 
jack, which allows you to pipe the signal from another audio device into 
your laptop. This one comes in particularly handy when you record MP3 
files from your old vinyl albums or when you want to record loops in 
GarageBand. (The MacBook Air doesn’t have an audio Line In jack.)
Don’t forget the parts you can’t see
When you bought your new digital pride and joy, you probably noticed a 
number of subtle differences between the low-end MacBook and the uber-
expensive, top-end MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. I call these dif-
ferences the Important Hidden Stuff (or IHS, if you’re addicted to acronyms 
already), and they’re just as important as the parts and ports that you can see.
Internal storage devices:
 
 CPU: Today’s Mac laptops feature — gasp! — Intel processors, which 
run faster and cooler than the old G4 processors that powered the iBook 
and PowerBook models. Of course, the faster the processor, the better. 
(Definitely not rocket science.)
 
 Hard drive: MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops use the latest in hard 
drive technology: namely, serial ATA hard drives, which are significantly 
faster than the EIDE hard drives used in previous Mac laptop models. 
(You don’t need to worry about what ATA and EIDE mean here. Really.) 
As you might expect, the MacBook Pro laptop line has a larger capacity 
hard drive as standard equipment, but you can special order a MacBook 
from Apple with a larger hard drive.
 
 The MacBook Air has two storage options: You can choose a mundane 
EIDE hard drive, or you can opt for the much more expensive (and much 
more technically impressive) solid-state drive. Hold on to your chair — 
there are no moving parts with a solid-state drive, and it offers better 
performance than a standard hard drive. Think of the solid-state drive 
as an internal USB flash drive, which uses RAM chips to hold your data 
instead of magnetic platters! Pricey, but super-sweet, and Apple once 
again introduces the latest in computer hardware.

 Optical drive: Okay, I’m cheating a little here. I mention the optical drive 
in an earlier section, but all you can see is the slot, so it qualifies as an 
IHS item. Depending on your Mac, your computer includes one of the 
following:
 
• No built-in optical drive
 
 The MacBook Air can be equipped with an external SuperDrive, or 
you can use another computer’s drive remotely over your wireless 
network.
 
• A DVD-R/CD-RW SuperDrive, which can play and record both CDs 
and DVDs
 
• A DVD/CD-RW combo drive, which can record CDs but only read DVDs
 
 If your laptop can’t burn DVDs with the internal drive, don’t give 
up hope of recording your own DVD movies. Thanks to those 
handy FireWire ports, it’s child’s play to add an external DVD 
recorder.
 
 Time for a plug: If you’re interested in recording your own audio and data 
CDs, or you have an itch to burn DVD movies, I can highly recommend 
the bestselling CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). It’s 
written by yours truly; hence the solid recommendation. You’ll find every-
thing you need to know to use Roxio’s Toast recording software. In a few 
minutes, you’ll be burning your own shiny digital treasures.
Wireless communications devices:
 
 Wireless Ethernet: “Look, Ma, no wires!” As I mention earlier, you can 
connect your laptop to an existing wireless Ethernet network. All cur-
rent Mac laptops have built-in AirPort Extreme hardware (older laptops 
can be upgraded with an internal AirPort or AirPort Extreme card). With 
wireless connectivity, you can share documents with another computer 
in another room, share a single high-speed Internet connection betwixt 
several computers, or enjoy wireless printing. Truly sassy!
 
 Although Apple would want you to build your wireless wonderland 
with an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station — go figure — you can use 
your Mac with any standard 802.11 wireless network. And yes, PCs and 
Macs can intermingle on the same wireless network without a hitch. 
(Scandalous, ain’t it?)
 
 Bluetooth: Let’s get the old “digital pirate” joke out of the way: “Arrgh, 
matey, I needs me a wireless parrot.” (Engineers again . . . sheesh.) 
Although strangely named, Bluetooth is another form of wireless con-
nectivity. This time, however, the standard was designed for accessories 
such as your keyboard and mouse, and devices such as a personal digi-
tal assistant (PDA) and a cellphone.

 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
Video display device:
 
 Video card: If your applications rely heavily on high-speed 3-D graphics, 
you’ll be pleased as punch to learn that today’s MacBook Pro line of laptops 
come equipped with muscle-bound cards, such as the NVIDIA GeForce 
8600M GT. This card is well suited to 3-D modeling, video editing, and well, 
honestly, blasting the enemy into small smoking pieces with aplomb. As of 
this writing, the MacBook and MacBook Air laptops use an integrated video 
card, so they’re not a good choice for hard-core gaming or 3-D design.
Meet the New MacBook Air
Here’s a corker of a conundrum: The MacBook Air is a revolutionary laptop, 
unique for both its size and weight (see Figure 1-2). And yet the Air is just like 
the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. Well, mostly.
“Hold on, Mark. How can it be so singular and yet share so much with its road 
warrior siblings?” That’s what I’ll show you in this section, which discusses 
the many similarities and the handful of very striking differences between the 
three laptops in the MacBook line. If you’re considering buying an Air, this 
section will help you decide whether you’d like to go ultra-thin or stick with 
the conventional laptop crowd.
One thing’s for sure — Apple never does things mundane!
 
Figure 1-2: 
Behold the 
MacBook 
Air.
 
Comparing ’twixt MacBooks
Do you remember when Apple introduced those first iMacs? Although they 
shared the same basic components as any computer — a monitor, keyboard, 
ports, speakers, and cables — the iMac was revolutionary because it was 

18
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
completely self-contained. And it came in colors. And it didn’t have a floppy 
drive. In fact, Apple had redesigned the common computer with the focus on 
style and ease-of-use, and had scrapped the floppy (and rightly so, seeing as 
how floppies had become practically useless and were unreliable, to boot).
I consider the MacBook Air to be an extension of the iMac revolution. With 
this new design, Apple has focused this time on physical dimensions and 
weight, and has tossed anything that isn’t absolutely necessary for the lecture 
hall, board room, or city park. However, I’m happy to note that the Air is no 
toy, nor is it a bare-bones sub-notebook. You’ll find the Air as powerful as the 
MacBook, and the Air even shares some of the features of the MacBook Pro.
What are the MacBook similarities?
Consider the similarities between the Air and the other MacBooks:
 
 Widescreen display: The Air has the same size display as the other 
MacBook models. Same display resolution, same gorgeous graphics. (In 
fact, at the time of this writing, the MacBook and MacBook Air have the 
same internal video hardware.)
 
 Intel Core 2 Duo processor: The Air is powered by the same type of CPU 
as its siblings.
 
 Keyboard and trackpad: The Air has a full-size keyboard, and it’s even 
backlit, just like the MacBook Pro. The Air’s trackpad includes support for 
Multi-Touch control, too. (Read more about Multi-Touch in Chapter 4.)
 
 Leopard: The Air runs the latest version of Mac OS X with aplomb.
 
 iSight and microphone: Every MacBook Air is video-ready, using the 
same iSight camera. You can record audio with the built-in microphone 
as well. (Read more about iSight and recording in Chapter 10.)
 
 Wireless support: Like the other MacBooks, the Air has both built-in 
AirPort Extreme hardware (802.11n) and built-in Bluetooth hardware. 
(Read more about these in Chapters 17 and 18.)
I think most Apple laptop owners would agree that this list covers the major 
features to look for in a MacBook, so we can all agree that the MacBook Air is 
no underpowered pushover.
So what’s so flippin’ radical?
I’m glad you asked! Here’s the checklist of striking differences that set the Air 
apart from the MacBook and MacBook Pro:
 
 Physical dimensions: Apple doesn’t call this machine the Air for noth-
ing! The current Air laptop measures a mere 0.76” in height (at its tallest 
point) when closed, 12.8” in width, and 8.94” in depth. Oh, and hold on 
to your chair for this one: Our champ weighs in at a lightweight three 

19
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
pounds! (That’s a couple of pounds you won’t be carrying around all 
day at that convention expo. Take it from this traveler: You will feel the 
refreshing difference in just an hour or two.)
 
 Cost: At the time of this writing, there are two versions of the laptop. An 
entry-level MacBook Air will set you back $1,800, and the top-of-the-line 
Air is a whopping $3,100. The more expensive Air is equipped with a 
very pricey, solid-state drive and a faster CPU. (Don’t miss the upcoming 
coverage on why solid-state is worth every penny.)
 
 Ports: The Air offers only three ports: a USB 2.0 port, an audio out jack, 
and a Micro-DVI for connecting an external monitor or video device. 
Notice I didn’t mention a FireWire port, which can be a big problem for 
Apple old-timers like me. I have a huge collection of FireWire devices. 
The Air also doesn’t have an infrared port, so it’s not compatible with 
the Apple Remote. Rats.
 
 Sealed battery: You can’t swap batteries with a MacBook Air because 
the battery is sealed inside the laptop. (Think iPod.)
 
 Sealed case: You can’t add or replace RAM modules. However, a 
MacBook Air comes equipped with 2GB of RAM, so you should be good 
to go. Comparatively, the MacBook and MacBook Pro models can be 
upgraded to 4GB of RAM.
 
 Speaker(s): The MacBook Air includes but one speaker.
 
 Solid-state drive: Now we’re talkin’, Buck Rogers! I discuss the solid-
state drive option in the next section.
 
 No built-in optical drive: Whoa, Nellie! This is a big one. Apple decided 
that a typical Air owner is likely to use a wireless connection for trans-
ferring files and media. But what if you have to reinstall Leopard or new 
applications? If you need to read or burn discs, a separate external USB 
SuperDrive is available for about $100, or you can use the Remote Disc 
feature and share the drive on another computer. (More on Remote Disc 
later in this section.)
As you can see, these striking differences make the choice between a 
MacBook Air and a MacBook/MacBook Pro very easy indeed. To wit: The Air 
is designed for the traveler who appreciates minimum weight and size, but 
who doesn’t want to sacrifice the power, full-size screen, and full-size key-
board of a typical MacBook. These folks see the MacBook Air as a racecar: 
nimble, with reduced weight and no unnecessary frills. (Think of a typical 
NASCAR entry: Who needs an expensive stereo or air conditioning?)
If you prefer the additional versatility of a MacBook or MacBook Pro — 
including the standard set of ports, the ability to swap batteries, and a 
built-in optical drive — I highly recommend that you stick with the more con-
ventional MacBook or MacBook Pro.

20
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
Look, Ma, no moving parts!
You’re probably familiar with the common species of usbius flashimus — 
more commonly called the USB Flash drive. With one of these tiny devices, 
you get the equivalent of a 2–8GB hard drive that plugs into a USB 2.0 port, 
allowing you to pack your data with you as you jet across the continents. But 
have you ever asked yourself, “Self, why don’t they make internal hard drives 
that use this same technology?”
Actually, dear reader, solid-state drives have been around for a number 
of years now (think iPod Shuffle). Unfortunately, however, the solid-state 
memory used in today’s Flash drives gets pretty expensive as capacity 
increases. In fact, the cost has been the limiting factor, as a solid-state drive 
offers a number of advantages that really set it apart from a conventional 
magnetic hard drive:
 
 No moving parts: Unlike a typical magnetic hard drive, there’s no read-
write heads, no magnetic platter — just gobs of happy silicon memory 
chips. In effect, a solid-state drive works along the same lines as your 
MacBook’s system RAM. Unlike your Mac’s RAM, though, a solid-state 
drive doesn’t lose the data it stores when you turn off your laptop. As 
you can imagine, no moving parts on a computer in motion is superior 
on two levels:
 
• The solid-state drive never wears out or needs replacing.
 
• If your laptop is accidentally abused (think, getting knocked off 
your desk), it’s far less likely that you’ll lose a hard drive’s worth 
of priceless data when it hits the ground.
 
 Speed: Oh, my goodness, is this thing fast! Your MacBook will boot/
restart/awake in far less time, and everything you do on your laptop will 
benefit from the speed boost. A solid-state drive can read data far faster 
than a conventional magnetic hard drive.
 
 Power usage: Forget your hard drive spinning up from sleep mode. The 
solid-state drive uses far less power than a conventional hard drive, 
resulting in significantly longer battery life.
 
 Blessed silence: The solid-state drive is completely silent. (No more of 
that gargling noise while the disk is accessed. Sweet.)
So do you need the solid-state drive option for your MacBook Air? The 
answer lies in your bank account (as well as your need for elbowroom). If you 
can afford the extra expense of the solid-state drive and you can fit all of your 
applications and data into 64GB, I heartily recommend that you consider join-
ing Buck Rogers with the storage device of the future.

21
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
If you’d rather save that coin for something else, or you need a larger internal 
hard drive to hold things like digital video and a massive collection of digital 
images, stick with the tried-and-true magnetic hard drive.
What if I need that pesky optical drive?
Can a laptop survive in the jungle that is Real Life without a DVD drive? The 
terse answer is no. I’ll be honest here: Ripping an audio CD or burning an 
iDVD slideshow disc without an optical drive is impossible. (Rather like a 
cheap tank of gas.) And the wonders of digital media are a big part of the 
iWorld. So what was Apple thinking?
First, a bit of explanation. Today’s DVD drives are thin, but not Air thin. In 
order to create the stunning Air design with truly revolutionary dimensions, 
Apples engineers had to leave out the drive. However, if you own a MacBook 
Air, you have two choices when it comes to reading the contents of a CD or 
DVD: Go external, or find how to share.
The external USB route
This is my choice. Personally, I have no problem at all toting around an exter-
nal USB DVD burner with a MacBook Air. Heck, half the time, you’re likely 
to leave it at home because most of us don’t install software every day. The 
folks at Cupertino want you to download your movies from the iTunes Store, 
so if you follow the Apple Path, you still don’t need an optical drive!
A USB SuperDrive from Apple costs a mere $100, and it can read and write 
DVDs as well as the built-in SuperDrive you’ll find in the MacBook and 
MacBook Pro.
You can also use any third-party USB DVD drive that’s compatible with 
Apple’s laptops and Mac OS X Leopard.
Sharing a CD or DVD drive
The other option for installing software or reading a DVD on the MacBook Air 
is Leopard’s built-in CD/DVD Sharing feature. Sharing is an option if you have a 
wired or wireless network (see Chapter 17) with at least one of the following:
 
 A Macintosh running Mac OS X Tiger or Leopard
 
 A PC running Windows XP or Vista
 
 This requires you to install a Windows application supplied by Apple 
with your MacBook Air.

22
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
You can only read from a shared optical drive. You can’t write data to the 
remote drive, even if that drive is a DVD recorder.
On the Macintosh with the optical drive, open System Preferences, click the 
Sharing icon, and then enable the DVD or CD Sharing check box. Note that 
you can set whether the Mac will request your permission when another 
computer attempts to share the drive.
On a PC, display Control Panel, click the DVD or CD Sharing icon, and then 
choose the Enable DVD or CD Sharing check box. Again, you can specify that 
permission is required if security is a concern.
After you set up the shared drive, just load the disc, and select the Remote 
Disc item in any Finder sidebar. (Remote Disc appears under the Devices 
heading in the sidebar.) Now you can access the drive as if it were directly 
connected to your MacBook Air. Ah, technology!
Location, Location, Location!
If you choose the wrong spot to park your new laptop, I can guarantee that 
you’ll regret it. Some domiciles and office cubicles don’t offer a choice — 
you have one desk at work, for example, and nobody’s going to hand over 
another one — but if you can select a home for your Mac, consider the 
important placement points in this section:
 
 Keep things cool. Your new laptop is silent, but that super-fast Intel 
Core 2 Duo processor generates heat. Make sure the location you 
choose is far from heating vents and shielded from direct sunlight. I also 
recommend a laptop cooling pad, which elevates the base of your laptop 
to allow air to circulate underneath.
 
 Outlets are key! Your computer needs a minimum of at least one nearby 
outlet, and perhaps as many as three:
 
• A standard AC outlet (using a current adapter if you’re traveling 
abroad, if necessary)
 
• A telephone jack (if you have an Apple modem for connecting to the 
Internet or sending and receiving faxes)
 
• A nearby Ethernet jack (if you use the MacBook or MacBook Pro’s 
built-in Ethernet port for connecting to a wired Ethernet network)
 
 If you prefer to send your data over the airwaves, consider wire-
less networking for your Mac — I discuss everything you need to 
know in Chapter 17.

23
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
 
 Don’t forget the lighting. Let me act as your Mom. (I know that’s a 
stretch, but bear with me.) She’d say, “You can’t possibly expect to work 
without decent lighting! You’ll go blind!” She’s right, you know. You need 
a desk or floor lamp at a minimum.
 
 Plan to expand. If your laptop hangs out on a desk, allow an additional 
foot of space on each side. That way, you have room for external periph-
erals, more-powerful speakers, and an external keyboard and mouse if 
you need one.
 
 If you want to keep an external keyboard handy, consider using a laptop 
shelf. These Plexiglas or metal stands elevate your laptop several inches 
above the desk, putting the screen at a better ergonomic position and 
allowing you to park your keyboard and external mouse underneath.
Unpacking and Connecting Your Laptop
You’re going to love this section. It’s short and sweet because the configura-
tion of a laptop on your desktop is a piece of cake. (Sorry about the cliché 
overload, but this really is easy.)
Unpacking for the road warrior
Follow these guidelines when unpacking your system:
 
 Check for damage. I’ve never had a box arrive from Apple with shipping 
damage, but I’ve heard horror stories from others (who claim that King 
Kong must have been working for That Shipping Company).
 
 Check all sides of your box before you open it. If you find significant 
damage, take a photograph (just in case).
 
 Search for all the parts. When you’re removing those chunks o’ foam, 
make certain that you’ve checked all sides of each foam block for parts 
snuggled therein or taped for shipment.
 
 Keep all packing materials. Do not head for the trash can with the box 
and packing materials. Keep your box and all packing materials for at 
least a year, until the standard Apple warranty runs out. If you have to 
ship the laptop to an Apple service center, the box and the original pack-
ing is the only way for your machine to fly.
 
 And now, a dramatic Mark’s Maxim about cardboard containers:
 
 Smart computer owners keep their boxes far longer than a year. If you 
sell your laptop or move across the country, for example, you’ll want 
that box. Trust me on this one.™

24
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
 Store the invoice for safekeeping. Your invoice is a valuable piece of 
paper, indeed.
 
 Save your original invoice in a plastic bag, along with your computer’s 
manuals and original software, and other assorted hoo-hah. Keep the 
bag on your shelf or stored safely in your desk, and enjoy a little peace 
of mind.
 
 Read the Mac’s manual. “Hey, wait a minute, Mark. Why do I have to 
read the manual from Apple along with this tome?” Good question, and 
here’s the answer: The documentation from Apple might contain new 
and updated instructions that override what I tell you here. (For example, 
“Never cut the red wire. Cut the blue wire instead.” Or something to that 
effect.) Besides, Apple manuals are rarely thicker than a restaurant menu.
 
 You can always download the latest updated manuals for Apple comput-
ers in electronic format from Apple’s Web site. (Adobe’s PDF format is 
the standard for reading documents on your computer, and Leopard can 
open and display any PDF document, using the Preview application.) I 
always keep a copy of the PDF manual for my MacBook Pro on my hard 
drive, just in case.
Connecting cables 101
Your laptop makes all its connections simple, but your computer depends on 
you to get the outside wires and thingamabobs where they go.
The absolutely essential connection
After your new Mac is resting comfortably in its assigned spot (I assume 
that’s a desktop), you need to make just one required connection: the power 
cable! Plug the cable into the corresponding socket on the Mac first, and then 
plug ’er into that handy AC outlet. (After your battery is completely charged, 
of course, you can go mobile at a moment’s notice.)
Adding the Internet to the mix
If you have Internet access or a local computer network, you need to make at 
least one of the following connections in this section.
If you get on the Internet by dialing a standard phone number and your 
laptop has an external USB modem, just make two more connections:
 
1. Plug one of the telephone cable’s connectors into your external modem.
 
2. Plug the other telephone cable connector into your telephone line’s 
wall jack.
After you get your account information from your ISP, Chapter 17 has the 
details on configuring your modem and Internet settings for dialup access.

25
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
If you have high-speed Internet service, or if you’re in an office or school with 
a local computer network, you can probably connect through your MacBook 
or MacBook Pro’s built-in Ethernet port. You make two connections:
 
1. Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the Mac.
 
2. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port from 
your network.
 
 Your network port is probably one of the following: an Ethernet wall 
jack, an Ethernet hub or switch, or a cable or DSL Internet router (or 
sharing device).
 
Will you be joining a wireless network? If so, you find the information you need 
on configuring Leopard for wireless networking in Chapter 17.
Great, a Lecture about 
Handling My Laptop
Proper handling of your laptop is important, so take a moment to cover the 
Rules of Proper Laptop Deportment. Okay, perhaps I’m lecturing a bit, but 
a little common sense goes a long way when handling any computer equip-
ment, and your laptop is no different. (Scolding mode off.)
Keep these rules in mind while opening and carrying your laptop:
 
 The cover is your friend. Open your laptop’s cover slowly, without jerk-
ing or bending it.
 
 Close it before you move it. By closing your laptop, you put your Mac 
OS X operating system into sleep mode, and the hard drive automati-
cally spins down (making it safer to move). The laptop is still on, and 
will spring back to life after you open the cover.
 
 Be nice to your keyboard. Don’t press too hard on those keys! Use 
the same amount of pressure that you use with a desktop computer 
keyboard.
 
 Keep food and drinks far away. Care to turn your laptop into a very 
expensive doorstop? Then go ahead and park your soda next to it. 
(Oh, and crumbs are perfect if you’re interested in buying replacement 
keyboards.)
 
 Keep your laptop as level as possible. Using your laptop while it’s tilted 
too far in any direction can eventually cause problems with your hard 
drive. I kid you not.

An Overview of Mac Software Goodness
This section answers the most common of all novice computer questions: 
“What the heck will I do with this thing?” You find additional details and excit-
ing factoids about the software that you get for free, software you’ll want to 
buy, and stuff you can do on the Internet.
What comes with my laptop?
Currently, Apple laptops ship with the following major software applications 
installed and ready to use:
 
 The iLife ’08 suite: You know you want these applications! They turn 
your Mac into a digital hub for practically every kind of high-tech device 
on the planet, including DV camcorders, digital cameras, portable music 
players, PDAs, and even cellphones.
 
 Chapters 11–15 focus on the major applications that make up iLife: 
iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and GarageBand.
 
 iWork trial version: You can try this productivity suite from Apple, but 
expect to buy the full shooting match if you want to continue using the 
applications.
 
 Photo Booth and Front Row: You discover more about these applica-
tions in Chapter 10. For now, suffice it to say that Photo Booth works 
with your laptop’s iSight camera, and Front Row is the remote-control 
software you’ll use with your Apple remote (if you have one).
 
The installed software on your Mac might change as new programs become 
available.
Connecting to the Internet from your lap
What is a modern computer without the Internet? Apple gives you great tools 
to take full advantage of every road sign and offramp on the Information 
Superhighway right out of the box:
 
 Web surfing: I use Leopard’s Apple Safari Web browser every single day. 
It’s faster and better designed than Internet Explorer, with unique fea-
tures such as tabbed browsing and built-in RSS feeds.

27
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
 
 If tabbed browsing and RSS feeds sound like ancient Aztec to you, don’t 
worry. Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to Safari.
 
 Web searches: Dashboard widgets can search the entire Internet for 
stocks, movie listings, airline schedules, dictionaries, and foreign lan-
guage translations. I explain Dashboard in Chapter 5.
 
 Chat: iChat lets you use your Mac to chat with others around the world 
for free on the Internet — by keyboard, voice, or full-color video. This 
is awesome stuff straight out of Dick Tracy and Buck Rogers. If you’ve 
never seen a video chat, you’ll be surprised by just how good your 
friends and family look!
 
 Always wear a shirt when videoconferencing.
 
 E-mail: Soldier, Apple’s got you covered. The Mail application is a full-
featured e-mail system, complete with defenses against the torrent of 
junk mail awaiting you. (Imagine a hungry digital saber-toothed tiger 
with an appetite for spam.) Send pictures and attached files to everyone 
on the planet, and look doggone good doing it.
Applications that rock
Dozens of small applications are built into Mac OS X. I mention them in later 
chapters, but here are four good examples to whet your appetite:
 
 Safari: Apple’s Web browser of choice — it’s fast, simple and easily cus-
tomized. See how to navigate the Web in style in Chapter 8.
 
 DVD Player: Put all that widescreen beauty to work and watch your 
favorite DVD movies with DVD Player! You have all the features of 
today’s most expensive standalone DVD players, too, including a spiffy 
onscreen control that looks like a remote.
 
 Address Book: Throw away that well-thumbed collection of fading 
addresses. Use the Leopard Address Book to store, search, and 
recall just about any piece of information on your friends, family, 
and acquaintances.
 
 Chess: Ah, but this isn’t the chessboard your Dad used! Play the game of 
kings against a tough (and configurable) opponent — your MacBook — on 
a beautiful 3-D board. Heck, your Mac even narrates the game by speaking 
the moves!
 
You can use the data you store in your Address Book in other Apple applica-
tions included with Leopard, such as Apple Mail and iChat.

Boot Camp For Dummies
Mac OS X Leopard introduced one particularly exciting feature for Windows 
switchers: You can use the Apple Boot Camp utility and your licensed 
copy of Windows XP to install and boot Windows on your Intel-based Mac 
laptop!
Boot Camp creates a Windows-friendly partition (or section) on your hard 
drive, where all your Windows files are stored. Other than the slightly strange 
key assignments you’ll have to remember, early adopters of Boot Camp 
report that it’s surprisingly reliable and easy to use. However, I strongly urge 
that you back up your laptop on a regular basis; inviting Windows to your 
Mac laptop also invites potential viruses as well.
Apple’s Boot Camp Assistant provides step-by-step instructions, making it 
easy to configure your laptop for Windows. To run the Boot Camp Assistant, 
open your Applications folder and double-click on the Utilities folder, and 
then double-click on the Boot Camp Assistant application icon. 
Other Stuff That Nearly Everyone Wants
No man is an island, and no computer is either. I always recommend the 
same set of stuff for new PC and Mac owners. These extras help keep your 
new computer clean and healthy (and some make sure you’re happy as well):
 
 Surge suppressor: Even an all-in-one computer like your laptop can fall 
prey to a power surge. I recommend using one of these:
 
• A basic surge suppressor with a fuse can help protect your Mac 
from an overload.
 
• A UPS (uninterruptible power supply) costs a little more, but it does 
a better job of filtering your AC line voltage to prevent brownouts 
or line interference from reaching your computer.
 
 Of course, your laptop’s battery immediately kicks in if you expe-
rience a blackout, so a UPS is less important for your computer. 
However, any computer tech will tell you that filtered AC current is 
far better for your laptop, and your UPS will also provide power for 
external devices that don’t have a battery.
 
 Screen wipes: Invest in a box of premoistened screen wipes to keep 
your screen pristine. Your Mac’s screen can pick up dirt, fingerprints, 
and other unmentionables faster than you think.
 
 Make sure your wipes are especially meant for LCD or laptop computer 
screens.

29
 Chapter 1: Hey, It Really Does Have Everything I Need
 
 Blank CDs and DVDs: Depending on the type of optical drive installed 
in your laptop — and the type of media you’re recording, such as com-
puter data CDs, DVD movies, or audio CDs — you’ll want blank discs for
 
• CD-R (record once)
 
• CD-RW (record multiple times)
 
• DVD-R (record once)
 
 Cables: Depending on the external devices and wired network connec-
tivity you’ll be using, these are
 
• A standard Ethernet cable (for wired networks or high-speed 
Internet)
 
• FireWire or USB cables for devices you already have
 
 A restraining cable: For those who are a little more security-conscious 
or tend to use their laptops in public places, a standard Kensington 
laptop lock slot is provided on the MacBook and MacBook Pro case. 
(Sorry, MacBook Air owners, but your case is too thin to sport a lock 
slot.) The principle is the same as a bicycle cable lock: If your laptop 
is secured by a cable to a sturdy fixture, it’s nearly impossible for it to 
walk off with someone else.
 
 A wrist rest: You might have many reasons to buy a new Mac laptop, but 
I know that a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome is not one of them. Take 
care of your wrists by carrying a keyboard wrist rest in your laptop bag.

n Chapter 1, you got as far as unpacking your Mac laptop and connecting 
a number of cables to it, but unless you bought this computer solely as a 
work of modern art, it’s time to turn on your Mac and begin living The Good 
Life. (Plus, you still get to admire that Apple design whilst using iTunes.) 
After you get your new beauty powered on, I show you how to run an initial 
checkup of your laptop’s health.
I also familiarize you with the initial chores that you need to complete — 
such as using the Mac OS X Setup and moving the data and settings from 
your existing computer to your MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro — 
before you settle in with your favorite applications.
In this chapter, I assume that Mac OS X Leopard was preinstalled on your 
Mac or that you just completed an upgrade to Leopard from an earlier ver-
sion of Mac OS X.
Tales of the On Button
Your Mac’s power switch is located on the right side of the keyboard. Press 
it now to turn on your Mac, and you will hear the pleasant startup tone that’s 

32
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
been a hallmark of Apple computers for many years. Don’t be alarmed if you 
don’t immediately see anything onscreen because it takes a few seconds for 
the initial Apple logo to appear.
 
In my experience, sometimes a simple quick press of the power button on 
some Mac laptop models just doesn’t do it. Rather, you actually have to 
hold the button down for a count of two or so before the computer turns on. 
However, if your Mac laptop ever locks up tight (and you can’t quit an appli-
cation, as I demonstrate in Chapter 4), the power button gives you another 
option: Hold it down for a count of five to ten (depending on your counting 
speed), and your Mac shuts off — even if your laptop is locked up tight.
As the Apple logo appears, you see a twirling, circular high-tech progress 
indicator that looks like something from a James Bond movie. That’s the sign 
that your Mac is loading Leopard and checking your internal drive for prob-
lems. Sometimes the twirling circle can take a bit longer to disappear. As long 
as it’s twirling, though, something good is happening.
Next, Leopard displays the soon-to-be-quite-familiar Aqua Blue (yup, that’s its 
name) background while it loads certain file sharing, networking, and print-
ing components (and such). This time, you get a more conservative progress 
bar, but the result is the same. Just wait patiently a bit longer.
At last, your patience of a whole 10–15 seconds is rewarded, and after a short 
(but neat) video, you see the Leopard Setup Assistant appear.
Mark’s Favorite Signs 
of a Healthy Laptop
Before you jump into the fun stuff, don’t forget an important step — a quick 
prelim check of the signs that your new mobile Mac survived shipment intact 
and happy.
If you can answer “yes” to each of these questions, your Mac likely made the 
trip without serious damage:
 
1. Does the computer’s chassis appear undamaged?
 
 It’s pretty easy to spot damage to your Mac’s svelte design. Look for 
scratches and puncture damage.
 
2. Does the LCD screen work, and is it undamaged?
 
 Does the cover open smoothly? Are any individual dots (or pixels) on 
your LCD monitor obviously malfunctioning? Bad pixels appear black or 
in a different color than everything surrounding them. (Techs call these 

33
 Chapter 2: Turning On Your Portable Powerhouse
irritating anarchists dead pixels. A 13" MacBook screen has literally hun-
dreds of thousands of pixels, and unfortunately, many new LCD screens 
include one or two dead ones.
 
3. Do the keyboard and trackpad work?
 
 Check your Mac’s built-in trackpad by moving your finger across its sur-
face; the cursor should move on your screen. To check the keyboard, 
press the Caps Lock key on the left and observe whether the Caps Lock 
light turns on and off.
If you do notice a problem with your laptop (and you can use your Safari 
browser and reach the Web), you can make the connection to an Apple sup-
port technician at www.apple.com. If your MacBook Pro remains dead — 
like an expensive paperweight — and you can’t get to the Internet, you can 
check your phone book for a local Apple service center, or call the AppleCare 
toll-free number at 1-800-275-2273. Chapter 19 also offers troubleshooting 
information.
You’re Not Going to Lecture 
about Batteries, Are You?
No, this is not going to be a lecture. In fact, the only lecture I put you through 
in this book concerns backing up (ahem, which you should do). Instead, con-
sider these tips as your rules of the road for monitoring and charging your 
battery:
 
 Recharge in sleep mode or when powered off. Your battery recharges 
faster when your laptop is off or in sleep mode. (I go into more detail on 
sleep mode in Chapter 6.)
 
 Keep your laptop plugged into an AC socket when possible. I take 
every opportunity to top off my laptop’s battery, and so should you.
 
 If you don’t have much time to charge your battery before you’re away 
from an AC socket — say, half an hour — don’t use your MacBook whilst 
it’s plugged in and charging.
 
 Save your juice. For the most juice you can scavenge, here are some 
easy tricks:
 
• Turn off your laptop or leave it in sleep mode.
 
• Turn off unnecessary hardware. To conserve battery power as 
much as possible, disconnect any USB or FireWire devices, and 
turn off your AirPort and Bluetooth wireless hardware if you’re not 
connected to a network. (I cover AirPort wireless networking in 
Chapter 17, and Bluetooth in Chapter 18.)

34
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
• Reduce the brightness of your display from your laptop’s keyboard, 
using the F1 key.
 
• Remove CDs and DVDs from the optical drive. (MacBook Air owners, 
don’t go hunting for a built-in optical drive, because your laptop 
doesn’t have one.)
 
 Monitor your battery level from the Finder menu. I love Leopard’s 
battery-monitoring system! Your laptop’s battery life can be displayed in 
the Finder menu in several different views — my personal favorite is as a 
percentage of power remaining (with a fully charged battery registering 
at 100%). To display the percentage, click the battery icon in the Finder 
menu and choose Show➪Percentage.
 
 Keep in mind that the percentage shown is estimated by using your 
current System Preference settings and power usage, so if you change 
your Energy Saver settings or remove a USB device that draws power 
from your laptop, you’ll see that change reflected in the battery meter. 
Figure 2-1 illustrates the battery meter in Percentage view.
 
 Calibrate your battery. You can “train” your battery to provide the 
maximum charge by calibrating it, which Apple recommends doing 
monthly. It’s a snap:
 
a. Charge your battery until the Finder menu battery meter indicates that 
the unit is fully charged at 100%.
 
b. Keep your laptop connected to an AC socket for another two hours to 
ensure a maximum charge.
 
c. Disconnect the power cord and use your laptop on battery power until 
it’s fully discharged and it automatically switches to sleep mode.
 
 Make sure that you close all your applications when you see 
the low battery warning dialog box so that you don’t lose any-
thing.
 
d. Allow your laptop to sleep (or turn it off) for a full five hours.
 
e. Reconnect the AC cord and fully charge your battery.
 
 If your battery is no longer holding a charge — in other words, if you 
fully charge it and unplug the AC adapter, only to discover that you 
have only a few minutes of battery life — it’s time to invest in a replace-
ment battery. MacBook and MacBook Pro owners can buy a new battery 
themselves (from Apple or any one of a number of online vendors), 
but owners of MacBook Air laptops must bring their computers in for 
servicing. The Air is a sealed unit, and you can’t replace the battery 
yourself.

Setting Up and Registering Your Laptop
After your Mac is running and you give it the once-over for obvious ship-
ping damage, your next chore is to set up your laptop. Unlike other tasks in 
this book, I won’t cover the setup process step by step. Apple contextually 
tweaks the questions that you see during setup on a regular basis, and the 
questions are very easy to answer. Everything is explained onscreen, com-
plete with onscreen Help if you need it.
However, I do want you to know what to expect as well as what information 
you need to have at hand. I also want you to know about support opportunities, 
such as the Apple .Mac Internet services. Hence, this section: Consider it a study 
guide for whatever your MacBook’s setup procedure has to throw at you.
Hot patootie, is my laptop steam-powered?
Laptops generate heat. And today’s super-fast 
multicore processors can work up a head of 
steam — pun intended — while you’re using 
them, and even though most MacBooks have 
a fan, some of that heat is simply radiated from 
the bottom of the computer.
What you might not realize, however, is just 
how much heat your MacBook, MacBook Air, 
or MacBook Pro can produce! No, you won’t be 
scalded if you shift your MacBook from a desk 
to your lap (Apple dislikes lawsuits as much as 
the next company), but if you’ve been using that 
laptop for hours, it will be uncomfortably hot!
To avoid that burning sensation, buy a laptop 
stand or cooling pad for your desk. These nifty 
metal or Plexiglas pedestals raise your laptop up 
off of your desk, allowing air to flow under the 
bottom of the computer for better cooling. Also, 
a laptop stand elevates the screen to a more 
ergonomic position. (The keyboard might sud-
denly be harder to use, naturally, but that’s yet 
another reason why I recommend an external 
keyboard when you’re using your Mac laptop at 
a semipermanent desk location; it saves wear 
and tear on your laptop keyboard, and you get 
a full-size keyboard.)

Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
Setting up Mac OS X Leopard
After you start your computer for the first time — or if you just upgraded 
from Mac OS 9 or an earlier version of Mac OS X — your laptop will likely 
launch Leopard Setup automatically. (Note that some custom install options, 
such as the Archive and Install option, might not launch the setup proce-
dure.) The setup process takes care of a number of different tasks:
 
 Setup provides Leopard with your personal information. As I mention 
in Chapter 1, your Mac ships with a bathtub full of applications, and 
many of those use your personal data (such as your address and tele-
phone number) to automatically fill out your documents.
 
 If that stored personal information starts you worrying about identity 
theft, I congratulate you. If you’re using your common sense, it should. 
However, in this case, Apple doesn’t disseminate this information any-
where else, and the applications that use your personal data won’t send 
it anywhere, either. And Safari, the Apple Web browser, fills out forms 
on a Web page automatically only if you give your permission.
 
 Setup creates your user account. You’ll be prompted for a username 
and password, which Setup uses to create your administrator-level 
account.
 
 Setup configures your language and keyboard choices. Mac OS X is a 
truly international operating system, so you are offered a chance to con-
figure your laptop to use a specific language and keyboard layout.
 
 Setup configures your e-mail accounts in Apple Mail. If you already 
have an e-mail account set up with your ISP, keep handy the e-mail 
account information that the ISP provided to answer these questions. 
The info should include the incoming POP3 and outgoing SMTP mail 
servers you’ll be using, your e-mail address, and your login name and 
password. Leopard can even automatically configure many Web-based 
e-mail accounts for you (including Google Mail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL 
Mail) if you supply your account ID and password. Sweet.
 
 Setup allows you to open a free trial subscription with Apple’s .Mac 
service. A .Mac subscription provides you with online file storage, iSync 
capability across multiple computers, backups to your online storage, 
Apple e-mail accounts (through both Web mail and the Apple Mail appli-
cation), photocasting, podcasting, and your own acre of iWeb site on 
the Internet. I go into all these in detail in Chapter 9, but for now, just 
sign up (or sign in, if you already have an existing account) and take the 
opportunity to feel smug about owning an Apple computer.
 
 Setup sends your registration information to Apple. As a proud owner 
of a Mac laptop, take advantage of the year of hardware warranty sup-
port and the free 90 days of telephone support. All you have to do is reg-
ister to use ’em. Rest assured that all this info is confidential.

37
 Chapter 2: Turning On Your Portable Powerhouse
 
 Setup launches Migration Assistant. This assistant guides you through 
the process of migrating (an engineer’s term for moving) your existing 
user data from your old Mac or PC to your new laptop. Naturally, if your 
MacBook is your first Macintosh computer, you can skip this step with 
a song in your heart! (Read more on Migration Assistant in the section, 
“Importing Stuff from Another Mac.”)
Registering your MacBook
I’ll be honest here: I know that many of us, myself included, don’t register 
every piece of computer hardware we buy. For example, I didn’t register my 
wireless Bluetooth adapter that I bought for my older iBook because the total 
expenditure was only around $40, the gizmo has no moving parts, and I’m 
never likely to need technical support to use it or get it fixed.
However, your MacBook is a different kettle of fish altogether, and I strongly 
recommend that you register your purchase with Apple during the setup pro-
cess. You spent a fair amount on your computer, and it’s an investment with 
a significant number of moving parts.
Even the hardiest of techno-wizards would agree with this important Mark’s 
Maxim:
 
If you don’t register your new laptop, you can’t receive support.™
And rest assured that Apple is not one of those companies that constantly 
pesters you with e-mail advertisements and near-spam. I’ve registered every 
Apple computer I’ve owned, and I’ve never felt pestered. (And I have an 
extremely low tolerance for pester.)
Importing Stuff from Another Mac
If you’re upgrading from an older Mac running Mac OS X to your new 
MacBook or MacBook Pro, I have great news for you: Apple includes 
Migration Assistant, a utility application that can help you copy (whoops, I 
mean, migrate) all sorts of data from your old Mac to your new machine, via 
your laptop’s FireWire port.
To use Migration Assistant to copy your system from your older Mac, you 
need a FireWire cable to connect the computers. If you don’t already have 
one, you can pick one up at your local Maze o’ Wires electronics store or at 
your computer store. (This cable will probably come in handy in the future 
as well, so it’s not a one-use wonder.)

38
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
If you’re a MacBook Air owner, you might be scratching your head looking for 
a FireWire port on your new laptop. Let me save you the trouble: You don’t 
have one. Therefore, you can’t use the Migration Assistant in FireWire mode 
at the time of this writing. (I hope that Apple will fix this and add USB 2.0 sup-
port to Migration Assistant soon.) However, you can use a network connec-
tion between computers. Assuming that both your MacBook and your older 
Mac can communicate over your home or office network, just click the Use 
Network button on the Connect Your Computers screen to transfer data!
As I mention earlier, Setup launches Migration Assistant automatically if you 
indicate that you need to transfer stuff during the setup process, but you can 
always launch Migration Assistant manually at any time. You’ll find it in the 
Utilities folder inside your Applications folder; just double-click the Migration 
Assistant icon.
The list of stuff that gets copied over includes the following:
 
 User accounts: If you set up multiple user accounts (so that more than 
one person can share the computer), the utility ports them all to your 
new Mac.
 
 Network settings: Boy, howdy, this is a real treat for those with manual 
network settings provided by an ISP or a network administrator! 
Migration Assistant can re-create the entire network environment of 
your old Mac on your new laptop.
 
 System Preference settings: If you’re a fan of tweaking and customizing 
Mac OS X to fit you like a glove, rejoice. Migration Assistant actually 
copies over all the changes that you’ve made in System Preferences on 
your old Mac! (Insert sound of angelic chorus: Hallelujah!)
 
 Documents: The files in your Documents folder(s) are copied to your 
new Mac.
 
 Applications: Migration Assistant tries its best to copy over the third-
party applications that you’ve installed in your Applications folder on the 
older Mac. I say tries its best because you might have to reinstall some 
applications, anyway. Some developers create applications that spread 
out all sorts of files across your hard drive, and Assistant just can’t keep 
track of those nomadic files. And some other applications make the trek 
just fine, but you might have to reenter their serial numbers.
Follow these steps to use Migration Assistant:
 
1. If Migration Assistant isn’t already open, open the Utilities folder 
inside your Applications folder and then double-click the Migration 
Assistant icon.

39
 Chapter 2: Turning On Your Portable Powerhouse
 
2. Click Continue on the opening screen.
 
 Migration Assistant prompts you for the account name and password 
that you create during the setup procedure, as shown in Figure 2-2. Your 
account is an admin account, meaning that you have a higher security 
level that allows you to change things in Leopard. (See Chapter 16 for 
much more detail on user accounts.)
 
Figure 2-2:
 Enter your 
admin 
password 
to use 
Migration 
Assistant.
 
 
3. Type your account name and password, and then click OK.
 
 Characters in your password are displayed as bullet characters for secu-
rity. After you successfully enter your admin account name and pass-
word, this dialog disappears, and you get to play in the real Migration 
Assistant dialog.
 
4. Select the From Another Mac radio button and then click Continue.
 
 In case you’ve lost the data on your hard drive (or you’ve upgraded 
your hard drive), you can also restore your MacBook’s data from a Time 
Machine backup drive by using Migration Assistant. (You find all the 
details on Time Machine in Chapter 21.)
 
5. Connect a FireWire cable between the two computers. Then click 
Continue.
 
 As I mention earlier, if you’d rather use a wired or wireless Ethernet 
connection between the computers, click the Use Network button 
and eschew the FireWire cable completely. (MacBook Air owners will 
also have to use a network connection because the Air doesn’t have a 
FireWire port.)

40
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
 If you take this route, skip Steps 6 and 7. Instead, run Migration Assistant 
on your older Mac and follow Steps 1–4, but click To Another Mac 
on your older machine and then click Continue. Follow the onscreen 
instructions to enter the passcode, and then continue with Step 8.
 
6. Restart your older Mac while holding down the T key.
 
 This restarts your older computer in FireWire Target Disk mode, in which 
your older Mac essentially becomes a huge external FireWire hard drive. 
(Neat trick.)
 
 You must hold down the T key until you see the FireWire symbol (which 
looks like a stylized Y) appears on your older machine.
 
7. Click Continue.
 
8. Select the check boxes next to the user accounts that you want to 
transfer from your older machine and then click Continue.
 
 Migration Assistant displays how much space is required to hold the 
selected accounts on your new laptop’s hard drive.
 
9. Select the check boxes next to the applications and files that you want 
to copy. Then click Continue.
 
10. Select the check boxes next to the settings that you want to transfer.
 
 Normally, you want to migrate all three of these settings groups: 
Network Settings, Time Zone and Sharing Settings.
 
11. Click the Migrate button.
 
12. After everything is copied, press the power button on your older Mac 
to shut it off. Then disconnect the FireWire cable (if necessary).
Importing Stuff from Windows 
(If You Must)
If you’re a Windows-to-Mac Switcher, you made a wise choice, especially if 
you’re interested in the creative applications in the iLife suite! Although you 
could choose to start your Apple computing life anew, you probably want to 
migrate some of your existing documents and files from that tired PC to your 
bright, shiny, new MacBook.

41
 Chapter 2: Turning On Your Portable Powerhouse
Unfortunately, Mac OS X has no Windows Migration Assistant. However, if 
you’re moving from a Windows PC to a Mac, you can copy your files manu-
ally from a CD or DVD, a USB Flash drive, or over a network. (Note, however, 
that today’s Mac laptops don’t come with a floppy drive. And trust me, you 
wouldn’t want to use one to move anything that matters, anyway.)
 
The Mac OS X Help system contains an entire subsection on specific tricks 
you can use when switching from Windows to Mac, including how to connect 
to a Windows network and how to directly connect the two computers.
Even with Boot Camp — Apple’s dual-boot feature that allows you to run both 
Leopard and Windows XP/Vista on your MacBook, MacBook Pro, or MacBook 
Air — manually moving existing Windows applications (such as Paint Shop 
Pro) to your laptop’s hard drive usually won’t work. That’s because most 
Windows software installs all sorts of necessary files in several folders across 
your hard drive. Instead, you have to install Windows XP or Windows Vista 
on your Mac laptop (using Boot Camp) and then reinstall your Windows 
applications.
 
If you don’t mind investing around $50, use the Move2Mac software utility, 
which does most of the work of Migration Assistant for those switching from 
a Windows PC. From Detto Technologies (www.detto.com/move2mac), 
Move2Mac comes complete with a special USB-to-USB cable that connects 
your two computers for high-speed copying. You can choose what you want 
to transfer to your new Mac (use Table 2-1 as a guide), and the copying is per-
formed automatically for you. Plus, Move2Mac transfers goodies such as your 
home page and bookmarks from Internet Explorer, desktop backgrounds, and 
even your Address Book contacts and account settings from Outlook Express. 
Move2Mac makes switching much easier, and I can highly recommend it.

Switching from a PC to . . . an Apple PC?
With the Leopard Boot Camp feature, you can 
actually create a full Windows XP or Vista 
system on your Intel-based Mac laptop. Yup, 
Windows and Leopard coexist peacefully on 
the same computer. However, you’ll have to 
reboot your computer to use your MacBook as 
a Windows system.
This brings a whole new meaning to the term 
Switcher because some Mac owners are 
moving their stuff from Windows (running on 
their old PC) to . . . well, Windows (running on 
their new laptop) instead of Leopard. If you do 
decide to create a Windows system on your 
MacBook with Boot Camp, the files and fold-
ers on your existing PC can be copied directly 
by using the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard 
(in Windows XP) or the Windows Easy Transfer 
utility (in Windows Vista). In effect, you’re copy-
ing your settings and data between your old PC 
and your new Apple-based PC! (That sounds a 
little skewed, but die-hard Apple apostles will 
have to forgive me.)

The Laptop Owner’s Introduction 
to Mac OS X
In This Chapter
 Introducing Mac OS X Leopard
 Appreciating the Unix core underneath Leopard
 Recognizing similarities between Windows XP and Leopard
 Getting help while learning about Leopard
I
n the other books that I’ve written about Mac OS X Leopard, I use all 
sorts of somewhat understated phrases to describe my operating system 
of choice, such as elegantly reliable, purely powerful, and supremely user 
friendly.
But why is Leopard such a standout? To be specific, why do creative profes-
sionals and computer techno-wizards across the globe hunger for the very 
same Mac OS X that runs your MacBook? Why is Leopard so far ahead of 
Windows Vista in features and performance? Good questions, all!
In this chapter, I answer those queries and satisfy your curiosity about your 
new big cat. I introduce the main elements of the Leopard Desktop, and I 
show you the fearless Unix heart that beats underneath Leopard’s sleek exte-
rior. I also point out the most important similarities between Leopard and 
Windows Vista, and I outline the resources available if you need help with 
Mac OS X.
Oh, and I promise to use honest-to-goodness English in my explanations, with 
a minimum of engineer-speak and indecipherable acronyms. (Hey, you’ve got 
to boast about Leopard in turn to your family and friends. Aunt Harriet might 
not be as technologically savvy as we are.)

44
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
Your Own Personal Operating System
Leopard is a special type of software called an operating system. You know, 
OS, as in Mac OS X? That means that Leopard essentially runs your MacBook 
and also allows you to run all your other applications, such as iTunes or 
Photoshop. It’s the most important computer application — or software — 
that you run.
 
Think of a pyramid, with Leopard as the foundation and other applications 
running on top.
You’re using the OS when you aren’t running a specific application, such as 
these actions:
 
 Copying files from a CD to your hard drive
 
 Choosing a different screensaver
Sometimes, Leopard even peeks through an application while it’s running. 
For example, application actions like these are also controlled by Leopard:
 
 The Open, Save, and Save As dialogs that you see when working with 
files in Photoshop
 
 The Print dialog that appears when you print a document in Microsoft 
Word
In this section, I escort you personally around the most important hotspots 
in Leopard, and you meet the most interesting onscreen thingamabobs 
that you use to control your laptop. (I told you I wasn’t going to talk like 
an engineer!)
The Leopard Desktop
This particular desktop isn’t made of wood, and you can’t stick your gum 
underneath. However, your Leopard Desktop does indeed work much like 
the surface of a traditional desk. You can store things there, organize things 
into folders, and take care of important tasks like running other applications. 
Heck, you’ve even got a clock and a trash can.
Gaze upon Figure 3-1 and follow along as you venture to your Desktop and 
beyond.

Meet me at the Dock
The Dock is the closest thing to the dashboard of a car that you’re likely to 
find on a Macintosh. It’s a pretty versatile combination: one part organizer, 
one part application launcher, and one part system monitor. From here, you 
can launch applications, see what’s running, and display or hide the windows 
shown by your applications.
Each icon in the Dock represents one of the following (many of which are 
proudly displayed in Figure 3-2):
 
 An application that you can run (or is running)
 
 An application window that’s minimized (shrunk)
 
 A Web page URL link

The Dock is highly configurable:

 It can disappear until you move your mouse pointer to the edge to call it 
forth.
 
 You can resize it.
Dig those crazy icons
By default, Leopard always displays at least one icon on your Desktop: your 
Mac’s internal hard drive. To open a hard drive and view or use the contents, 
you double-click the icon. Other icons that might appear on your Desktop 
can include
 
 CDs and DVDs
 
 An iPod
 
 External hard drives or USB Flash drives
 
 Applications, folders, and documents
 
 Files you downloaded from the Internet
 
 Your iDisk (if you have a .Mac account)
 
 Network servers you access

There’s no food on this menu
The Finder menu isn’t found in a restaurant. You find it at the top of the 
Desktop, where you can use it to control your applications. Virtually every 
application that you run on your laptop has a menu.
 
To use a menu command, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the menu group (such as File or Edit).
 
2. Choose the desired command from the list that appears (see Figure 3-3).
 
Virtually every Macintosh application has some menu groups, such as File, 
Edit, and Window. You’re likely to find similar commands within these groups. 
However, only two menu groups are in every Mac OS X application:
 
 The Apple menu (which is identified with that jaunty Apple Corporation 
icon, Ú).
 
 The Application menu (which always bears the name of the active appli-
cation). For instance, the DVD Player menu group appears when you run 
the Leopard DVD Player, and the Word menu group appears when you 
launch Microsoft Word.
I cover these two common groups in more detail in Chapters 4 and 5.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Clicking a 
menu group 
displays a 
list of menu 
commands.
 

48
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
 
You can also display a contextual menu — which regular human beings call a 
right-click menu — by right-clicking your Leopard Desktop, or an application, a 
folder, or a file icon. I get into the right-click menu in detail in the next chapter. 
(You can also right-click by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking, or by tap-
ping the trackpad with two fingertips.)
There’s always room for one more window
You’re probably already familiar with the ubiquitous window itself. Both 
Leopard and the applications that you run use windows to display things like
 
 The documents that you create
 
 The contents of your hard drive
For example, the window in Figure 3-1 is a Finder window, where Leopard 
gives you access to the applications, documents, and folders on your system.
Windows are surprisingly configurable. I cover them at length in Chapter 4.
Why get so excited by Leopard?
How the core of an operating system is designed makes more of a differ-
ence than all the visual bells and whistles, which tend to be similar between 
Windows Vista/XP and Mac OS X Leopard (and Linux as well, for that matter). 
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Sure, Leopard’s elegant exterior is a joy to use, but Mac OS X is a better OS 
than Windows because of the unique Unix muscle that lies underneath!™
So what should you and I look for in an OS? Keep in mind that today’s com-
puter techno-wizard demands three requirements for a truly high-powered 
software wonderland — and Mac OS X Leopard easily meets all three:
 
 Reliability: Your OS has to stay up and running reliably for as long as 
necessary — I’m talking months here — without lockups or error mes-
sages. If an application crashes, the rest of your work should remain 
safe, and you should be able to shut down the offending software.
 
 Performance: If your computer has advanced hardware, your OS must 
be able to use those resources to speed things up big-time. The OS has 
to be highly configurable, and it has to be updated often to keep up with 
the latest in computer hardware.
 
 “Mark, what do you mean by advanced hardware?” Well, if you’re already 
knowledgeable about state-of-the-art hardware, examples include
 
• True 64-bit computing
 
• Multiple processors (like more than one Intel chip in your computer)

49
 Chapter 3: The Laptop Owner’s Introduction to Mac OS X
 
• A huge amount of RAM (2GB on most MacBooks, or far more on 
today’s Mac Pro desktop computers)
 
• Enough hard drive space to make use of a RAID array
 
 If all that sounds like ancient Sumerian, gleefully ignore this technical 
drabble and keep reading.
 
 Ease of use: All the speed and reliability in the world won’t help an OS if 
it’s difficult to use.
Like Windows done right
You might have heard of the Windows Switcher: a uniquely intelligent species 
that’s becoming more and more common these days. Switchers are former 
PC owners who have abandoned Windows and bought a Macintosh, thereby 
joining the Apple faithful running Mac OS X. (Apple loves to document this 
migration on its Web site.) Because today’s Macintosh computers are signifi-
cantly faster than their PC counterparts — and you get neat software, such 
as Leopard and the iLife suite when you buy a new Mac — switching makes 
perfect sense.
Switchers aren’t moving to totally unfamiliar waters. Windows XP, Windows 
Vista, and Leopard share a number of important concepts. Familiarizing your-
self with Leopard takes far less time than you might think.
It’s Apple to the rescue!
Unix is the established, super-reliable OS that 
powers most of the high-performance servers 
that make up the Internet. Unix has built-in sup-
port for virtually every hardware device ever 
wrought by the hand of Man (including all the 
cool stuff that came with your MacBook), and 
Unix is well designed and highly efficient.
Unfortunately, standard Unix looks as hideous 
as DOS, complete with a confusing command 
line, so ease-of-use for normal human beings 
like you and me goes out the door. Enter the 
genius types at Apple, who understood several 
years ago that all Unix needed was a state-of-
the-art, novice-friendly interface! To wit: Mac 
OS X was developed with a Unix foundation 
(or core), so it shares the same reliability and 
performance as Unix. However, the software 
engineers at Apple (who know a thing or two 
about ease-of-use) made it good looking and 
easy to use.
If you’re interested in all the details about what 
makes Mac OS X tick, as well as its settings and 
features, I can heartily recommend another of 
my books, the bestselling (and extremely heavy) 
Mac OS X Leopard All-in-One Desk Reference 
For Dummies (Wiley). It comprehensively 
covers everything Leopard — over 700 pages 
devoted entirely to Mac OS X and its companion 
applications!

50
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
Here’s an overview of the basic similarities between the two operating systems:
 
 The Desktop: The Leopard Desktop is a neat representation of a real 
physical desktop, and Windows uses the same idea:
 
• You can arrange files, folders, and applications on your Desktop to 
help keep things handy.
 
• Application windows appear on the Desktop.
 
 Drives, files, and folders: Data is stored in files on your hard drive(s), 
and those files can be organized in folders. Both Leopard and Windows 
use the same file/folder concept.
 
 Specific locations: Both Windows and Leopard provide every user with 
a set of folders to help keep various types of files organized. For exam-
ple, the My Videos folder that you can use in Windows XP corresponds 
to the Movies folder that you find in your Home folder within Leopard.
 
 Running programs: Both Leopard and Windows run programs (or appli-
cations) in the same manner:
 
• Double-clicking an application icon launches that application.
 
• Double-clicking a document runs the corresponding application 
and then automatically loads the document.
 
 Window control: Yep, both operating systems use windows, and those 
windows can be resized, hidden (or minimized), and closed in similar 
fashions. (Are you starting to see the connections here?)
 
 Drag and drop: One of the basics behind a GUI (a ridiculous acronym 
that stands for graphical user interface) like Windows and Leopard is the 
ability to drag documents and folders around to move, delete, copy, and 
load them. Drag-and-drop is one of the primary advantages of both of 
these operating systems because copying a file by dragging it from one 
window to another is intuitive and easy enough for a kid to accomplish.
 
 Editing: Along the same lines as drag-and-drop, both Leopard and 
Windows offer similar cut-and-paste editing features. You’ve likely used 
Cut, Copy, and Paste for years, so this is familiar stuff.
And Just in Case You Need Help . . .
You can call on these resources if you need additional help while you’re dis-
covering how to tame the Leopard.
 
Some of the help resources are located on the Internet, so your Web browser 
will come in handy.

The Leopard built-in Help system
Sometimes the help you need is as close as the Help group on the Finder 
menu. You can get help for either
 
 A specific application: Just click Help. Then, click in the Search box 
and type a short phrase that sums up your query (such as startup keys). 
You’ll see a list of help topics appear on the menu. Just click a topic to 
display more information.
 
 General topics: Click a Finder window and then click Help on the menu. 
Again, you’ll see the Search box, and you can enter a word or phrase to 
find within the Help system. To display the Help viewer window, click 
the Mac Help item under the Search box.
The Apple Web-based support center
Apple has online product support areas for every hardware and software 
product that it manufactures. Visit www.apple.com and click the Support 
tab at the top of the Web page.
 
The Search box works just like the Mac OS Help system, but the Knowledge 
Base that Apple provides online has a lot more answers.
Magazines
Many magazines (both in print and online) offer tips and tricks on using and 
maintaining Mac OS X Leopard.
 
My personal online favorites are Macworld (www.macworld.com) and 
MacLife (www.maclife.com).
Mac support Web sites
A number of private individuals and groups offer support forums on the Web, 
and you can often find help from other Mac owners on these sites within a 
few hours of posting a question.
 
I’m very fond of MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), Mac OS X Hints (http://
forums.macosxhints.com) and MacMinute (www.macminute.com).

52
Part I: Tie Myself Down with a Desktop? Preposterous! 
Mac newsgroups on Usenet
If you’re familiar with Usenet newsgroups, you can find lots of help (typically 
dispensed with a healthy dose of opinion) in newsgroups like comp.sys.
mac.system and comp.sys.mac.applications. Simply post a message 
and then check back within a few hours to read the replies.
Local Mac user groups
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention your local Mac user group. Often, a user 
group maintains its own Web site and discussion forum. If you can wait until 
the next meeting, you can even ask your question and receive a reply from a 
real-live human being . . . quite a thrill in today’s Web-riffic world!

Spotlight search technology to fi nd anything you’ve stored 
on your MacBook, MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air!

A
h, the Finder — many admire its scenic beauty, but don’t ignore its 
unsurpassed power nor its many moods. And send a postcard while 
you’re there.
Okay, so Leopard’s Finder might not be quite as majestic as the mighty 
Mississippi River, but it’s the basic toolbox that you use every single day 
while piloting your MacBook. The Finder includes the most common ele-
ments of Mac OS X: window controls, common menu commands, icon fun 
(everything from launching applications to copying files), network connec-
tions, keyboard shortcuts, and even emptying the Trash. In fact, one could 
say that if you master the Finder and find how to use it efficiently, you’re on 
your way to becoming a power user! (My editor calls this the Finder “window 
of opportunity.” She’s a hoot.)
That’s what this chapter is designed to do: This is your Finder tour guide, 
and we’re ready to roll.
Using the All-Powerful Finder
This is a hands-on tour, with none of that, “On your right, you’ll see the 
historic Go menu” for you! Time to get off the bus and start the tour with 

56
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Figure 4-1, in which I show you around the most important elements of the 
Finder. (In the upcoming section, “Performing Tricks with Finder Windows,” I 
give you a close-up view of window controls.)
The popular attractions include
 
 The Apple menu (Ú): This is a special menu because it appears both 
in the Finder and within every application menu that you run. It doesn’t 
matter whether you’re in iTunes or Photoshop or Word: If you can see a 
menu bar, the Apple menu is there. The Apple menu contains common 
commands to use no matter where you are in Leopard, such as Restart, 
Shut Down, and System Preferences.
 
 The Finder menu bar: Whenever the Finder itself is ready to use (or, in 
Mac-speak, whenever the Finder is the active application, rather than 
another application), the Finder menu bar appears at the top of your 
screen. You know the Finder is active and ready when the word Finder 
appears at the left of the menu bar.
 
 If you’re brand new to computers, a menu is simply a list of commands. 
For example, you click the File menu and then choose Save to save a 
document. When you click a menu, it extends down so that you can see 
the commands it includes. While the menu is extended, you can choose 
any enabled menu item (just click it) to perform that action. You can tell 
that an item is enabled if its name appears in black. Conversely, a menu 
command is disabled if it is grayed out — clicking it does nothing.
 
 When you see a menu path, like this example — File➪Save — it’s just 
a visual shortcut that tells you to click the File menu and then choose 
Save from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 The Desktop: Your Desktop serves the same purpose as your physical 
desktop: You can store stuff here (files, alias icons, and so on), and it’s 
a solid, stable surface where you can work comfortably. Application 
windows appear on the Desktop, for example, as do other applications, 
such as your Stickies notes and your DVD player. Just double-click an 
application there to launch it.
 
 Your Desktop is easily customized in many ways. For example, you can 
use your own images to decorate the Desktop, organize it to store new 
folders and documents, arrange icons how you like, or put the Dock in 
another location. Don’t worry — I cover all this in other areas of the 
book — I just want you to know that you don’t have to settle for what 
Apple gives you as a default Desktop.
 
 All sorts of icons: This is a Macintosh computer, after all, replete with 
tons of make-your-life-easier tools. Check out the plethora of icons on 
your Desktop as well as icons within the Finder window itself. Each icon 
is a shortcut of sorts to a file, folder, network connection, or device in 

57
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
your system, including applications that you run and documents that 
you create. Refer to Figure 4-1 to see the icon for my MacBook Pro’s 
hard drive icon, labeled Wolfgang. (I’m a huge Mozart fan.) Sometimes 
you click an icon to watch it do its thing (like icons in the Dock, which 
I cover next), but usually you double-click an icon to make something 
happen.
 
 The Dock: The Dock is a launching pad for your favorite applications, 
documents, folders, network connections, and Web sites. You can also 
refer to it to see what applications are running. Click an icon there to 
open the item. For example, the postage stamp icon represents the 
Apple Mail application, and clicking the spiffy compass icon launches 
your Safari Web browser.
 
 The Finder window: Finally! The basic Finder window in Figure 4-1 dis-
plays the contents of my Applications folder. You use Finder windows to 
launch applications; perform disk chores, such as copying and moving 
files; and navigate your hard drive.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Wait a Second: Where the Heck 
Is the Right Mouse Button?
Leopard takes a visual approach to everything, and what you see in Figure 4-1 is 
designed for point-and-click convenience because the trackpad is your primary 
navigational tool while you’re using your Mac laptop. You move your finger over 
the surface of the trackpad, and the cursor follows like an obedient pup. The 
faster you move your finger, the farther the cursor goes. You click an item, it 
opens, you do your thing, and life is good.
 
Never use any object other than your finger on the trackpad! That means no 
pencils (no, not even the eraser end), pens, or chopsticks; they can damage 
your trackpad in no time at all.
If you’ve grazed on the other side of the fence — one of Those Who Were 
Once Windows Users — you’re probably accustomed to using a mouse with 
at least two buttons. This brings up the nagging question: “Hey, Mark! Where 
the heck is the right button?”
In a nutshell, the right button simply ain’t there. At least, if you’re using your 
Mac laptop’s trackpad, it simply ain’t there. The entire bottom of the track-
pad is one huge button, and you click something by pressing down anywhere 
on the top surface of the aforementioned bump.
My, what an attractive Sidebar . . . and so useful!
Have you noticed the Sidebar that occupies the 
left side of every Finder window? It’s a pane of 
links to common locations and devices that you 
can use to jump like a flash to a specific spot 
on your hard drive. For example, you can click 
the Applications link under the Places heading, 
and you’re there in an instant. The Sidebar also 
contains a Search For heading that displays 
the applications, files and folders that you’ve 
accessed today, yesterday and this past week. 
(Heck, you can even search for all the images, 
movies, and documents on your system from 
this same Search For section!)
Here’s a great example of Sidebar magic: I like 
as few icons on my Desktop as possible, so 
each book I’m working on gets its own folder. 
All the items for that project that might other-
wise end up on my Desktop are saved into that 
folder instead. In fact, I make a point of adding 
my current book project folder to my Finder 
window Sidebar so that it’s available immedi-
ately from any Finder window. To do this, just 
drag the folder into the column at the left side of 
the Finder window and drop it under the Places 
heading in the Sidebar’s list.

59
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
Lean in closer, and I’ll tell you a secret. (Dramatic pause.) This is one of the 
few disagreements that I have with my friends at Apple Inc. Once upon a 
time, Apple felt that a mouse needed but one button, and until the arrival of 
the Mighty Mouse on Apple’s desktop models, it was the only button you got. 
And you liked it. And you still do, if you’re using a Mac laptop’s trackpad.
If you’re like me, you feel that a right button is pretty doggone essential. In 
fact, when my laptop is on my desk at home, I plug in a Logitech optical track-
ball (a really fancy mouse, in effect). This neat device has both a right mouse 
button and a scroll wheel. So here’s a Mark’s Maxim that I think you’ll appre-
ciate more and more as you use your laptop.
 
If you can afford a new USB mouse or trackball with more than one button, 
buy it. You can thank me later with an e-mail message, which you can send to 
mark@mlcbooks.com.™
In fact, a new industry is springing up for tiny USB mousing devices especially 
made for laptops. Some devices are smaller than a business card, but they 
still carry a full complement of two buttons and a scroll wheel. You can carry 
one of these mini-mice in your laptop bag and eschew your trackpad com-
pletely. In fact, in this book I’m going to refer to the pointer as the “mouse 
pointer,” whether you’re using your trackpad or a mouse.
If you have a pointing device with two buttons, you’ll find that clicking the 
right mouse button performs the same default function in Leopard that it 
does in Windows. Namely, when you click the right mouse button on most 
items — icons, documents, even your Desktop — you get a contextual menu 
of things. That is, you get more commands specific to that item. (Boy, howdy, 
I hate that word contextual, but that’s what engineers call it. I call it the right-
click menu, and I promise to refer to it as such for the rest of the book.)
Figure 4-2 illustrates a typical convenient right-click menu within a Finder 
window. I have all sorts of cool items at my disposal on this menu because of 
the applications I’ve installed that make use of a right-click menu.
If you’re using your laptop’s trackpad or one-button mouse, don’t despair. 
You can still display a right-click menu: Just hold down the Control key while 
you click.
Pressing an extra key, as you might imagine, can be a real downer, especially 
if your non-trackpad-using hand is busy doing something else. Hence my pre-
ceding Mark’s Maxim. Someday, Apple will finally throw in the towel and add 
a second trackpad button to their laptops. Luckily, you can also configure 
your trackpad to recognize a tap with two fingertips as a right-click (as I men-
tion earlier in this section).

60
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Figure 4-2: 
Well-
adjusted 
folks call 
this a right-
click menu.
 
Clicking and right-clicking magic
 
Here are some handy and painless workarounds: Head over to System 
Preferences and open the Keyboard & Mouse Pane (under Hardware). Look 
for the Trackpad options. Find the Clicking check box and enable it. Now, 
when you tap the trackpad quickly, your Mac laptop counts that as a click, 
and two fast taps act as a double-click. Enable the Tap Trackpad Using Two 
Fingers for Secondary Click check box, and suddenly a single tap with two fin-
gers displays the right-click menu (which I cover in more detail in a paragraph 
or two).
It’s okay to scroll with your fingers
 
If you move two fingers over the surface of the trackpad at once, the Finder 
window or application scrolls the contents of the window in the direction you 
move. (For example, you can use the scroll function to move up and down 
through the pages of a document or to move up and down through a long Web 
page.) Who needs scroll bars?

61
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
Doing the Multi-Touch thing
The latest crop of MacBooks — including the MacBook Air — have the smart-
est trackpads on the planet! That’s because Apple recently introduced a new 
feature called Multi-Touch, which allows you to control the view of a docu-
ment by using specific finger motions on the trackpad. Here’s the rundown:
 
 Two-finger zooming: Pinching your thumb and first fingertip toward 
each on the trackpad other zooms in on a document or image. The 
reverse (moving your fingertips away from each other) zooms out.
 
 Two-finger rotating: Rotate your thumb and first fingertip in a circle 
on the trackpad to rotate an image or document in the corresponding 
direction.
 
 Three-finger paging: Move your thumb and first two fingertips to the 
left or right across your trackpad to page through a document or move 
to the next or previous image in a set.
Unfortunately, Multi-Touch doesn’t work with every application, but support 
for this neat feature is rapidly being added by Apple software developers. 
(For now, I recommend you try out your fingertips in iPhoto and Pages!) 
 
Visit the Keyboard & Mouse pane within System Preferences to configure your 
wireless mouse as well. (More on the System Preferences window in the next 
section.)
Launching and Quitting Applications 
with Aplomb
Now it’s time for you to pair your newly found trackpad acumen with 
Leopard’s Finder window. Follow along this simple exercise. Move your 
cursor over the iTunes icon in the Dock (this icon looks like an audio CD 
with musical notes on it). Then click the trackpad button (default) or tap the 
trackpad once with your fingertip (see the preceding section for how to set 
this preference). Whoosh! Leopard launches (or starts) the iTunes applica-
tion, and you see a window much like the one in Figure 4-3.
 
If an application icon is already selected (which I discuss in the next section), 
you can simply press Ô+O to launch it. The same key shortcut works with 
documents, too.

62
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Figure 4-3: 
Click a Dock 
icon to 
launch that 
application.
 
Close Window button
Besides the Dock, you have several other ways to launch an application or 
open a document in Leopard:
 
 From the Apple menu (Ú): A number of different applications can 
always be launched anywhere within Leopard from the Apple menu:
 
• System Preferences: This is where you change all sorts of settings, 
such as your display background and how icons appear.
 
• Software Update: This uses the Internet to see whether update 
patches are available for your Apple software, as I discuss in 
Chapter 21.
 
• Mac OS X Software: This launches the Safari browser and displays 
software that you can download for your laptop.
 
 From the Desktop: If you have a document that you created or an appli-
cation icon on your Desktop, you can launch or open it here by double-
clicking that icon (clicking the trackpad button twice in rapid succession 
when the mouse pointer is on top of the icon). Remember that you can 
also configure your MacBook’s trackpad to accept a single tap with one 
fingertip as a click.

63
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
 Double-clicking a device or network connection on your Desktop opens 
the contents in a Finder window. This works for CDs and DVDs that 
you’ve loaded as well as external hard drives and USB Flash drives. Just 
double-click ’em to open them and display their contents in a Finder 
window. Applications and documents launch from a CD, a DVD, or an 
external drive just like they launch from your internal drive (the one 
that’s typically named Macintosh HD), so you don’t have to copy stuff 
from the external drive just to use it. (You can’t change the contents of 
most CDs and DVDs; they’re read only, so you can’t write to them.)
 
 From the Recent Items selection: When you click the Apple menu and 
hover your mouse pointer over the Recent Items menu item, the Finder 
displays all the applications and documents that you used over the past 
few computing sessions. Click an item in this list to launch or open it.
 
 From the Login Items list: Login Items are applications that Leopard 
launches automatically each time you log in to your user account.
 
 I cover Login Items in detail in Chapter 16.
 
 From the Finder window: You can also double-click an icon within the 
confines of a Finder window to open it (for documents), launch it (for 
applications), or display the contents (for a folder).
 
The Quick Look feature that debuted with Leopard can display the contents 
of just about any document or file — but without actually opening the corre-
sponding application! Sweet. To use Quick Look from a Finder window, click a 
file to select it and then click the Quick Look button (which bears an eye icon) 
on the Finder window toolbar.
After you finish using an application, you can quit that application to close 
its window and return to the Desktop. Here are a number of different ways to 
quit an application:
 
 Press Ô+Q. This keyboard shortcut quits virtually every Macintosh 
application on the planet. Just make sure that the application that you 
want to quit is currently active first!
 
 Choose the Quit command from the application’s menu. To display 
the Quit command, click the application’s name — its menu — from the 
menu bar. This menu is always to the immediate right of the Apple (Ú) 
menu. For example, Safari displays a Safari menu, and that same spot 
in the menu is taken up by iCal when iCal is the active application. In 
Figure 4-3, look for the iTunes menu, right next to Ú.
 
 Choose Quit from the Dock. You can Control-click (or right-click) an 
application’s icon on the Dock and then choose Quit from the right-click 
menu that appears. Alternatively, just click the icon and hold down the 
button to display the same menu.
 
 A running application displays a small blue dot under its icon on the Dock.

64
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Click the Close button on the application window; refer to Figure 4-3. 
Some applications quit entirely when you close their window, like the 
System Preferences window or the Apple DVD Player. Other applications 
might continue running without any window, like Safari or iTunes; to 
close these applications, you have to use another method in this list.
 
 Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu. This is a last-resort mea-
sure! Use this only if an application has frozen and you can’t use 
another method in this list to quit. Force-quitting an application doesn’t 
save any changes to any open documents within that application!
Juggling Folders and Icons
Finder windows aren’t just for launching applications and opening the files 
and documents that you create. You can also use the icons within a Finder 
window to select one or more specific items or to copy and move items from 
place to place within your system.
A field observer’s guide to icons
Not all icons are created equal. Earlier in this chapter, I introduce you to your 
MacBook’s hard drive icon on the Desktop, but here is a little background on the 
other types of icons that you might encounter during your mobile Mac travels:
 
 Hardware: These are your storage devices (such as your hard drive and 
DVD drive) as well as external peripherals (such as your iPod and printer).
 
 Applications: These icons represent the applications (or programs) that 
you can launch. Most applications have a custom icon that incorporates 
the company’s logo or the specific application logo, so they’re very easy 
to recognize, as you can see in Figure 4-4. Double-clicking an application 
usually doesn’t load a document automatically; you typically get a new 
blank document, or an Open dialog box from which you can choose the 
existing file you want to open.
 
 Documents: Many of the files on your hard drive are documents that can 
be opened within the corresponding application, and the icon usually 
looks similar to the application’s icon. Double-clicking a document auto-
matically launches the required application (that is, as long as Mac OS X 
recognizes the file type).
 
 Files: Most of the file icons on your system are mundane things (such as 
preference and settings files, text files, log files, and miscellaneous data 
files), yet most are identified with at least some type of recognizable 
icon that lets you guess what purpose the file serves. You’ll also come 
across generic file icons that look like a blank sheet of paper (used when 
Leopard has no earthly idea what the file type is).

 Aliases: An alias acts as a link to another item elsewhere on your system. 
For example, to launch Adobe Acrobat, you can click an Adobe Acrobat 
alias icon that you can create on your Desktop rather than clicking the 
actual Acrobat application icon. The alias essentially acts the same way as 
the original icon, but it doesn’t take up the same space — only a few bytes 
for the icon itself, compared with the size of the actual application. Plus, 
you don’t have to go digging through folders galore to find the original 
application icon. (Windows Switchers know an alias as a shortcut, and the 
idea is the same although Macs had it first. Harrumph.) You can always 
identify an alias by the small curved arrow at the base of the icon, and the 
icon might also sport the tag alias at the end of its name.
 
 You have two ways to create an alias. Here’s one:
 
a. Select the item.
 
 The following section has details about selecting icons.
 
b. Choose File➪Make Alias, or press Ô+L.
 
 Figure 4-5 illustrates a number of aliases, arranged next to their 
linked files.
 
 Here’s another way to create an alias:
 
a. Hold down Ô+Option.
 
b. Drag the original icon to the location where you want the alias.
 
 Note that this funky method doesn’t add the alias tag to the end 
of the alias icon name!

Figure 4-5: 
No, not the 
popular

show. These 
are alias 
icons in 
Leopard.
 
So why bother to use an alias? Two good reasons:
 
 Launch an application or open a document from anywhere on your 
drive. For example, you can start Pages directly from the folder where 
you store the documents for your current Pages project. Speed, organi-
zation, and convenience . . . life is good.
 
 Send an alias to the Trash without affecting the original item. When 
that school project is finished, you can safely delete the entire folder 
without worrying about whether Keynote will run the next time you 
double-click the application icon!
 
If you move or rename the original file, Leopard is actually smart enough to 
update the alias, too! However, if the original file is deleted (or if the original 
is moved to a different volume, such as an external hard drive), the alias no 
longer works. (Go figure.)
Selecting items
Often, the menu commands or keyboard commands that you perform in the 
Finder need to be performed on something: Perhaps you’re moving an item 
to the Trash, or getting more information on the item, or creating an alias for 

67
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
that item. In order to identify the target of your action to the Finder, you need 
to select one or more items on your Desktop or in a Finder window. In this 
section, I show you just how to do that.
Selecting one thing
Leopard gives you a couple of options when selecting just one item for an 
upcoming action:
 
 Move your mouse pointer over the item and click. A dark border (or 
highlight) appears around the icon, indicating that it’s selected.
 
 If an icon is already highlighted on your Desktop or within a window, 
move the selection highlight to another icon in the same location by 
using the arrow keys. To shift the selection highlight alphabetically, press 
Tab (to move in order) or press Shift+Tab (to move in reverse order).
 
Selecting items in the Finder doesn’t actually do anything to them by itself. 
You have to perform an action on the selected items to make something 
happen.
Selecting a whole bunch of things
You can also select multiple items with aplomb by using one of these methods:
 
 Adjacent items
 
• Drag a box around them. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian, 
here’s the explanation: Click a spot above and to the left of the first 
item; then hold down the trackpad button and drag down and to 
the right. (This is dragging in Mac-speak.) A box outline like the one 
in Figure 4-6 appears, indicating what you’re selecting. Any icons 
that touch or appear within the box outline are selected when you 
release the button.
 
• Click the first item to select it and then hold down the Shift key while 
you click the last item. Leopard selects both items and everything 
between them.
 
 Nonadjacent items: Select these by holding down the Ô key while you 
click each item.
 
Check out the status line at the bottom of a Finder window. It tells you how 
much space is available on the drive you’re working in as well as how many 
items are displayed in the current Finder window. When you select items, it 
shows you how many you highlighted.

Copying items
Want to copy items from one Finder window to another, or from one location 
(like a CD-ROM) to another (like your Desktop)? Très easy. Just use one of 
these methods:
 
 On the same drive
 
• To copy one item to another location: Hold down the Option key 
(you don’t have to select the icon first) and then click and drag the 
item from its current home to the new location.
 
 To put a copy of an item within a folder, just drop the item on top 
of the receiving folder. If you hold the item that you’re dragging 
over the destination folder for a second or two, Leopard opens up 
a new window so you can see the contents of the target. (This is 
called a spring-loaded folder. Really.)
 
• To copy multiple items to another location: Select them all first (see 
the earlier section, “Selecting a whole bunch of things”), hold down 
the Option key and then drag and drop one of the selected items 
where you want it. All the items that you selected follow the item 
you drag. (Rather like lemmings. Nice touch, don’t you think?)
 
 To help indicate your target when you’re copying files, Leopard high-
lights the location to show you where the items will end up. (This works 
whether the target location is a folder or a drive icon.) If the target loca-
tion is a window, Leopard adds a highlight to the window border.

69
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
 On a different drive
 
• To copy one or multiple items: Click and drag the icon (or the 
selected items if you have more than one) from the original 
window to a window you open on the target drive. (No need to 
hold down the Option key whilst copying to a different drive.) You 
can also drag one item (or a selected group of items) and simply 
drop the items on top of the drive icon on your Desktop.
 
 The items are copied to the top level, or root, of the target drive.
If you try to move or copy something to a location that already has an item 
with the same name, you get a dialog that prompts you to decide whether to 
replace the file or to stop the copy/move procedure and leave the existing 
file alone. Good insurance, indeed.
Moving things from place to place
Moving things from one location to another location on the same drive is the 
easiest action you can take. Just drag the item (or selected items) to the new 
location. The item disappears from the original spot and reappears in the 
new spot.
Duplicating in a jiffy
If you need more than one copy of the same item within a folder, use the 
Leopard Duplicate command. I use Duplicate often when I want to edit a doc-
ument but ensure that the original document stays pristine, no matter what. I 
just create a duplicate and edit that file instead.
To use Duplicate, you can
 
 Click an item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate.
 
 Right-click the item and choose Duplicate from the menu.
 
 Hold down the Option key and drag the original item to another spot 
in the same window. When you release the trackpad button, the dupli-
cate file appears like magic!
The duplicate item has the word copy appended to its name. A second copy 
is named copy2, a third is copy3, and so on.
 
Duplicating a folder also duplicates all the contents of that folder, so creat-
ing a duplicate folder can take some time to create if the original folder was 
stuffed full. The duplicate folder has copy appended to its name, but the con-
tents of the duplicate folder keep their original names.

Keys and Keyboard Shortcuts 
to Fame and Fortune
Your MacBook’s keyboard might not be as glamorous as your trackpad, but 
any Macintosh power user will tell you that using keyboard shortcuts is usu-
ally the fastest method of performing certain tasks in the Finder, such as 
saving or closing a file. I recommend committing these shortcuts to memory 
and putting them to work as soon as you begin using your laptop so that they 
become second nature to you as quickly as possible.
Special keys on the keyboard
The Apple standard keyboard has a number of special keys that you might not 
recognize — especially if you’ve made the smart move and decided to migrate 
from the chaos that is Windows to Mac OS X! Table 4-1 lists the keys that bear 
strange hieroglyphics on the Apple keyboard as well as what they do.

The Finder is chock-full of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to take care 
of common tasks. Some of the handiest shortcuts are in Table 4-2.
 
But wait, there’s more! Most of your applications also provide their own set 
of keyboard shortcuts. While you’re working with a new application, display 
the application’s Help file and print out a copy of the keyboard shortcuts as a 
handy cheat sheet.

If you’ve used a PC before, you’re certainly familiar with three-key shortcuts — 
the most infamous being Ctrl+Alt+Delete, the beloved shut-down shortcut, nick-
named the Windows Three-Finger Salute. Three-key shortcuts work the same 
way in Leopard (but you’ll be thrilled to know you won’t need to reboot by using 
that notorious Windows shortcut)! If you’re new to computing, just hold down 
the first two keys simultaneously and then press the third key.
 
You’re not limited to just the keyboard shortcuts listed above, either. Within 
System Preferences, visit the Keyboard & Mouse pane and then click the 
Keyboard Shortcuts button to change an existing shortcut or add another!
Performing Tricks with Finder Windows
In this section of your introduction to Mac OS X, I describe basic windows 
management within Leopard: how to move things around, how to close win-
dows, and how to make ’em disappear and reappear like magic.
Scrolling in and resizing windows
Can you imagine what life would be like if you couldn’t see more than a single 
window’s worth of stuff? Shopping would be curtailed quite a bit — and so 
would the contents of the folders on your hard drives!
That’s why Leopard adds scroll bars that you can click and drag to move 
through the contents of the window. You can
 
 Click the scroll bar and drag it.
 
 Click anywhere in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages 
one at a time.
 
 Hold down the Option key and click anywhere in the empty area above 
or below the bar to scroll to that spot in the window.
 
Of course, you can also drag two fingertips across the trackpad to scroll the 
contents of a window (both vertically and horizontally). To control trackpad 
behavior, open System Preferences, click the Keyboard & Mouse pane, and 
then click the Trackpad button. You can read all about this in the earlier sec-
tion, “Wait a Second: Where the Heck Is the Right Mouse Button?”
Figure 4-7 illustrates both vertical and horizontal scroll bars in a typical 
Finder window.
 
Often, pressing your Page Up and Page Down keys moves you through a docu-
ment one page at a time. Also, pressing your arrow keys moves your insertion 
cursor one line or one character in the four compass directions.

You can also resize most Finder and application windows by enlarging or 
reducing the window frame itself. Move your mouse pointer over the Resize 
handle in the lower-right corner of the window (which smartly bears a 
number of slashed lines to help it stand out) and then drag the handle in any 
direction until the window is the precise size you need.
Minimizing and restoring windows
Resizing a window is indeed helpful, but maybe you simply want to banish 
the doggone thing until you need it again. That’s a situation for the Minimize 
button, which also appears in Figure 4-7. A minimized window disappears from 
the Desktop but isn’t closed: It simply reappears in the Dock as a miniature 
icon. Minimizing a window is easy: Move your mouse pointer over the Minimize 
button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign appears in the button 

74
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
to tell you that you’re on target — and then click. Here’s a good shortcut: double-
clicking the window’s title bar (that’s the top frame of the window, which usually 
includes a document or application name) minimizes the window.
 
Hold down the Shift key whilst you minimize, and prepare to be amazed when 
the window shrinks in slow motion like Alice in Wonderland!
To restore the window to its full size again (and its original position on the 
Desktop), just click its window icon on the Dock.
Moving and zooming windows
Perhaps you want to move a window to another location on the Desktop so 
you can see the contents of multiple windows at the same time. Click the 
window’s title bar and drag the window anywhere you like. Then release the 
button. (Don’t click the icon in the center of the title bar, though. You won’t 
move the window, just the icon itself.)
 
Many applications can automatically arrange multiple windows for you. 
Choose Window➪Arrange All menu item (if it appears).
To see all that a window can show you, use the Zoom feature to expand any 
Finder or application window to its maximum practical size. (This is different 
from zooming with the Multi-Touch feature because you’re expanding only the 
window — and not an image or a document.) Note that a zoomed window can fill 
the entire screen, or (if that extra space isn’t applicable for the application) the 
window might expand only to a larger part of the Desktop. To zoom a window, 
move your mouse pointer over the button (as shown in Figure 4-7) at the top-left 
corner of the window. When the plus sign appears in the Zoom button, click to 
claim the additional territory on your Desktop. (You can click the Zoom button 
again to automatically return the same window to its original dimensions.)
Only one can be active at once™
Yes, here’s a very special Mark’s Maxim in the 
Mac OS X universe.
 
 Only one application window can be active 
in Leopard at any time.™
You can always tell which window is active:
  The active window is on top of other 
windows.
 
 Tip: You can still use a window’s Close, 
Minimize, and Zoom buttons when it’s 
inactive.
  Any input you make by typing or by moving 
your finger on the trackpad appears in the 
active window.
  Mac OS X dims inactive windows that you 
haven’t minimized.

75
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
Closing windows
When you’re finished with an application or no longer need a window open, 
move your mouse pointer over the Close button at the top-left corner of the 
window. When the X appears in the button, click it. (And yes, I can get one 
more reference out of Figure 4-7, which I’m thinking of nominating as Figure 
of the Year.)
 
If you have more than one window open in the same application and you want 
to close ’em all in one swoop, hold down the Option key whilst you click the 
Close button on any of the windows.
 
If you haven’t saved a document and you try to close that application’s 
window, Leopard gets downright surly and prompts you for confirmation. 
“Hey, human, you don’t really want to do this, do you?” If you answer in the 
affirmative — “Why, yes, machine. Yes, indeed, I do want to throw this away 
and not save it.” — the application discards the document that you were 
working on. If you decide to keep your document (thereby saving your poste-
rior from harm), you can either save the document under the same filename 
or under a new name.
Toggling toolbars the Leopard way
Time to define a window control that’s actually 
inside the window for a change. A toolbar is a 
strip of icons that appears under the window’s 
title bar. These icons typically perform the most 
common actions within an application; the 
effect is the same as if you use a menu or press 
a keyboard shortcut. Toolbars are very popu-
lar these days. You see ’em within everything 
from the Finder window to most application 
windows.
You can banish a window’s toolbar to make 
extra room for icons, documents, or whatever 
it happens to be holding. Just click the little 
lozenge-shaped button at the right corner of the 
window. (You guessed it — the Toolbar button 
is also shown in Figure 4-7.) Note: If you toggle 
the Finder toolbar off, you also lose the Finder 
window Sidebar.

hen you’re no longer a novice to Leopard and the basics of the 
Finder, turn your attention to a number of more advanced topics ’n 
tricks to turn you into a MacBook power user — which, after all, is the goal of 
every civilized consciousness on Planet Earth.
Consider this chapter a grab bag of Leopard knowledge. Sure, I jump around 
a little, but these topics are indeed connected by a common thread: They’re 
all surefire problem-solvers and speeder-uppers. (I can’t believe the latter is 
really a word, but evidently it is. My editors told me so.)
Home, Sweet Home Folder
Each user account that you create within Leopard is actually a self-contained 
universe. For example, each user has a number of unique characteristics and 
folders devoted just to that person, and Leopard keeps track of everything 
that user changes or creates. (In Chapter 16, I describe the innate loveliness 
of multiple users living in peace and harmony on your laptop.)
This unique universe includes a different system of folders for each user 
account on your system. The top-level folder uses the short name that 
Leopard assigns when that user account is created; don’t necessarily look for 
a folder named “Home.” Naturally, the actual folder name is different for each 

78
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
person, and Mac techno-types typically refer to this folder as your Home 
folder. (On the sidebar, look for the teeny house icon under the Places head-
ing, marked with your account name.)
Each account’s Home folder contains a set of subfolders, including
 
 Movies
 
 Music
 
 Pictures
 
 Downloads (for files you download by using Safari)
 
 Sites (for Web pages created by the user)
 
 Documents (created by the user)
Although you can store your stuff at the root (top level) of your hard drive, 
that gaggle of files, folders, and aliases can get very crowded and confusing 
very quickly. Here’s a Mark’s Maxim to live by:
 
Your Home folder is where you hang out and where you store your stuff. Use it 
to make your computing life much easier!™
 
Create subfolders within your Documents folder to organize your files 
and folders even further. For example, I always create a subfolder in my 
Documents folder for every book that I write so that I can quickly and easily 
locate all the documents and files associated with that book project.
I discuss security within your Home folder and what gets stored where in 
Chapter 16. For now, Figure 5-1 shows how convenient your Home folder is 
to reach because it appears in the Finder window Sidebar. One click of your 
Home folder, and all your stuff is in easy reach.
In addition to the Finder window Sidebar, you can also reach your Home 
folder in other convenient ways:
 
 From the Go menu: Choose Go➪Home to display your Home folder 
immediately from the Finder window. Alternatively, you can press 
Ô+Shift+H to accomplish the same thing.
 
 From within Open and Save dialogs: Leopard’s standard File Open and 
File Save dialogs also include the same Home folder (and subfolder) 
icons as the Finder window Sidebar.
 
 Within any new Finder window you open: If you like, you can set every 
Finder window that you open to automatically display your Home folder.
 
a. Choose Finder➪Preferences to display the dialog that you see in 
Figure 5-2.

 You’re set to go. From now on, every Finder window you open dis-
plays your Home folder as the starting location!
 
Here’s another reason to use your Home folder to store your stuff: Leopard 
expects your stuff to be there when you migrate your files from an older Mac 
to a new Mac.
Personalizing Your Desktop
Most folks put all their documents, pictures, and videos on their Leopard 
Desktop because the file icons are easy to locate! Your computing stuff is 
right in front of you . . . or is it?
Call me a finicky, stubborn fussbudget — go ahead, I don’t mind — but I 
prefer a clean Leopard Desktop without all the iconic clutter. In fact, my 
Desktop usually has just three or four icons even though I use my MacBook 
Pro several hours every day. It’s an organizational thing; I work with liter-
ally hundreds of applications, documents, and assorted knickknacks daily. 
Sooner or later, you’ll find that you’re using that many, too. When you keep 
your stuff crammed on your Desktop, you end up having to scan your screen 
for one particular file, an alias, or a particular type of icon, which ends up 
taking you more time to locate it on your Desktop than in your Documents 
folder!
Plus, you’ll likely find yourself looking at old icons that no longer mean 
anything to you or stuff that’s covered in cobwebs that you haven’t used in 
years. Stale icons . . . yuck.
I recommend that you arrange your Desktop so you see only a couple of 
icons for the files or documents that you use the most. Leave the rest of the 
Desktop for that cool image of your favorite actor or actress.
Besides keeping things clean, I can recommend a number of other favorite 
tweaks that you can make to your Desktop:
 
 Keep Desktop icons arranged as you like.
 
a. From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View Options.
 
b. Select the Arrange By check box.

81
 Chapter 5: Getting to the Heart of the Leopard
 
c. From the pop-up menu, choose the criteria that Leopard uses to auto-
matically arrange your Desktop icons, including the item name, the 
last modification date, or the size of the items.
 
 I personally like things organized by name.
 
 Choose a favorite background.
 
a. Hold down the Control key while you click any open spot on your 
Desktop. (Or, if you use a pointing thing with a right mouse button, 
click that instead.)
 
b. From the right-click menu that appears, choose Change Desktop 
Background.
 
 You see the Desktop & Screen Saver pane appear, as shown in Figure 
5-3. Browse through the various folders of background images that 
Apple provides or use an image from your iPhoto library.
 
 Display all the peripherals and network connections on your system.
 
a. Choose Finder➪Preferences.
 
b. Make sure that all four of the top checkboxes (Hard Disks; External 
Disks; CDs, DVDs, and iPods; and Connected Servers) are enabled.
 
 If you’re connected to an external network or you’ve loaded an 
external hard drive or device, that shows up on your Desktop. You 
can double-click that Desktop icon to view your external stuff.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Customizing the Dock Just So
If the Dock seems like a nifty contraption to you, you’re right again — it’s like 
one of those big control rooms that NASA uses. From the Dock — that icon 
toolbar at the bottom of Leopard’s Desktop — you can launch an application, 
monitor what’s running, and even use the pop-up menu commands to control 
the applications that you launch. (Hey, that NASA analogy is even better than 
I thought!)
 
By default, the Dock hangs out at the bottom of your screen, but you can 
move it to another edge, change the size of the icons, or even hide it until it’s 
necessary. (You can find more details on customizing your Dock in Chapter 6.)
When you launch an application — either by clicking an icon on the Dock 
or by double-clicking an icon in a Finder window or the Desktop — the icon 
begins to bounce hilariously on the Dock to indicate that the application 
is loading. (So much for my Mission Control analogy.) After an application 
is running, the application icon appears on the Dock with a shiny blue dot 
underneath. Thusly, you can easily see what’s running at any time just by 
glancing at the Dock.
 
You can hide most applications by pressing Ô+H.
Adding Dock icons
Ah, but there’s more: The Dock can offer more than just a set of default icons! 
You can add your own MIS (or Most Important Stuff) to the Dock, making it 
the most convenient method of taking care of business without cluttering up 
your Desktop. You can add
 
 Applications: Add any application to your Dock by dragging the applica-
tion icon into the area to the left of the separator line (the vertical dotted 
line on the Dock which appears between applications and folders or 
documents). The existing Dock icons move aside so that you can place 
the new neighbor in a choice location.
 
 Do not try to add an application anywhere to the right of the separator 
line. You can’t put applications there — and Leopard might even think 
that you want the application dumped in the Trash!
 
 Folders: Here’s where you want to add things to the area to the right 
of the separator line. A folder or volume icon that you drag to the Dock 
is called a Stack in Leopard, and you can display the contents with a 
single click. (The contents of the folder “fan out” into a half-circle or grid 

83
 Chapter 5: Getting to the Heart of the Leopard
arrangement, depending on the number of items in the folder.) To open 
or launch an item, just click it in the Stack display. Folders that include 
many items are displayed in a grid view.
 
 Leopard already includes two Stacks in the Dock by default: your 
Documents folder and your Downloads folder.
 
 Web URLs: Sure, you can add your favorite Web site from Safari! Drag it 
right from the Safari Address bar into the area to the right of the separa-
tor line. When you click the URL icon, Safari opens the page automatically.
Removing Dock icons
You can remove an icon from the Dock at any time (as long as the applica-
tion isn’t running). In fact, I always recommend that every Leopard user 
remove the default icons that never get used to make more room available 
for your favorite icons. The only two icons you can’t remove are the Finder 
and the Trash icons. To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag 
it off the Dock. You’re rewarded with a ridiculous puff of smoke straight out 
of a Warner Brothers cartoon! (One of the Mac OS X developers was in a fun 
mood, I guess.)
 
When you delete an icon from the Dock, all you delete is the Dock icon: The 
original application, folder, or volume is not deleted.
Using Dock icon menus
From the Dock menu, you can open documents, open the location in a Finder 
window, set an application as a Login Item, control the features in some 
applications, and other assorted fun, depending on the item.
To display the right-click Dock menu for an icon
 
1. Move your mouse over the icon.
 
2. Right-click.
 
 Note that you can also press the Control key and click the icon, or even 
hold down the left mouse button for a second or two.
 
I cover the Dock settings that you can change within System Preferences in 
Chapter 6. You can also change the same settings from the Apple menu if you 
hover your mouse over the Dock menu item, which displays a submenu with 
the settings.

What’s with the Trash?
Another sign of a Mac laptop power user is a well-maintained Trash can. It’s 
a breeze to empty the discarded items you no longer need, and you can even 
rescue something that you suddenly discover you still need!
Previewing images and documents 
the Leopard way
Leopard’s new Quick Look feature (available on 
the Finder window toolbar) has garnered a lot 
of attention within the technology press, and 
rightly so. Just select a file and click the Quick 
Look button (or just press the spacebar), and 
Leopard instantly displays the contents of the 
document or image, without opening the appli-
cation. Heck, I’ve been waiting for such a magic 
lamp for two decades now!
However, don’t forget that Mac OS X has always 
offered a Swiss Army knife application for view-
ing image files and documents: namely, Preview. 
You can use Preview to display digital photos in 
several popular image formats, including TIFF, 
GIF, PICT, PNG, JPEG, and Windows Bitmap.
I know, if that were the sum total of Preview’s 
features, it wouldn’t deserve coverage here. So, 
what else can it do? Here’s a partial list (just my 
favorites, mind you):
  Use Preview to add a bookmark at the 
current page within a PDF document by 
choosing Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
  Fill out a form in a PDF document by choos-
ing Tools➪Text Tool.
 
 Click an area that’s marked as an input 
field, and you can type text into that field. 
After you complete the form, you can fax or 
print it.
  Take a screen snapshot (saving the con-
tents of your screen as a digital photo) by 
choosing File➪Grab➪Timed Screen.
 
 Preview launches the Grab utility, which 
displays an onscreen timer and then snaps 
the image for you after ten seconds. (This 
gives you time to get things just right before 
saying, “Cheese!”)
  Convert an image into another format or 
into a PDF file by choosing File➪Save As.
 
 If a PDF document can be edited, you can 
delete or insert pages at will.
  Resize or rotate an image by using the 
commands on the Tools menu.
Leopard automatically loads Preview when you 
double-click an image in a format that it rec-
ognizes or when you double-click a PDF file. It 
also acts as the Print Preview window, as you 
can read elsewhere in this chapter. However, 
if you want to launch Preview manually, open a 
Finder window, click the Applications folder in 
the Sidebar, and then double-click the Preview 
icon.

85
 Chapter 5: Getting to the Heart of the Leopard
The Leopard Trash icon resides on the Dock, and it works just like the Trash 
has always worked in Mac OS X: Simply drag selected items to the Trash to 
delete them.
 
Note one very important exception: If you drag a Desktop icon for an external 
device or removable media drive to the Trash (such as an iPod, iPhone, DVD, 
or an external hard drive), the Trash icon automagically turns into a giant 
Eject icon, and the removable device or media is ejected or shut down — not 
erased. Repeat, not erased. (That’s why the Trash icon changes to the Eject 
icon — to remind you that you’re not doing anything destructive.)
Here are other methods of chunking items you select to go to the wastebasket:
 
 Choose File➪Move to Trash.
 
 Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and choose Move to Trash 
from the list that appears.
 
 Press Ô+Delete.
 
 Right-click the item and choose Move to Trash from the menu that 
appears.
You can always tell when the Trash contains at least one item because the 
basket icon is full of crumpled paper! However, you don’t have to unfold a 
wad of paper to see what the Trash holds: Just click the Trash icon on the 
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. To rescue something from the 
Trash, drag the item(s) from the Trash folder to the Desktop or any other 
folder in a Finder window. (If you’re doing this for someone else who’s not 
familiar with Leopard, remember to act like it was a lot of work, and you’ll 
earn big-time DRP, or Data Rescue Points.)
When you’re sure that you want to permanently delete the contents of the 
Trash, use one of these methods to empty the Trash:
 
 Choose Finder➪Empty Trash.
 
 Choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash.
 
 If security is an issue around your laptop and you want to make sure 
that no one can recover the files you’ve sent to the Trash, using the 
Secure Empty Trash command takes a little time but helps to ensure 
that no third-party hard drive repair or recovery program could resusci-
tate the items you discard.
 
 Press Ô+Shift+Delete.
 
 Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock and then choose Empty Trash 
from the menu that appears.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Working Magic with Dashboard, 
Exposé, and Spaces
MacBook power users tend to wax enthusiastic over the convenience fea-
tures built into Leopard. In fact, we show ’em off to our PC-saddled friends 
and family. Three of the features that I’ve demonstrated the most to others 
are Leopard’s Dashboard display, the amazing convenience of Exposé, and 
the brand-new Spaces Desktop manager. In this section, I show ’em off to you 
as well. (Then you can become the Leopard evangelist on your block.)
Using Dashboard
The idea behind Dashboard is deceptively simple yet about as revolutionary 
as it gets for a mainstream personal computer operating system. Dashboard 
is an alternate Desktop that you can display at any time by using the key-
board or your mouse; the Dashboard desktop holds widgets (small applica-
tions that each provide a single function). Examples of default widgets that 
come with Leopard include a calculator, a world clock, weather display, and 
a dictionary/thesaurus.
Oh, did I mention that you’re not limited to the widgets that come with 
Leopard? Simply click the plus button at the bottom of the Dashboard dis-
play and drag new widgets to your Dashboard from the menu at the bottom 
of the screen. To remove a widget while you’re in this mode, click the X icon 
that appears next to each widget. When you’re done with your widgets — 
that sounds a bit strange, but I mean no offense — press the Dashboard key 
again to return to your Desktop.
 
Widgets can also be rearranged any way you like by dragging them to a new 
location.
Simple applications like these are no big whoop — after all, Mac OS X 
has always had a calculator and a clock. What’s revolutionary is how you 
access your widgets. You can display and use them anywhere in Leopard, 
at any time, by simply pressing the Dashboard key. The default key is F12 
although you can change the Dashboard key via the Exposé & Spaces pane 
within System Preferences (or even turn it into a key sequence, such as 
Option+F12). You can also click the Dashboard icon on the Dock to summon 
your Dashboard widgets and then banish the Dashboard when you’re done.
 
Click the scroll ball on your Mighty Mouse to display your Dashboard.

87
 Chapter 5: Getting to the Heart of the Leopard
A WebClip widget is a portion of a Web page that can include text, graphics, 
and links, which Dashboard updates every time you display your widgets. 
Think about that for a second: Dynamic displays, such as weather maps, car-
toons, and even the Free Music Download image from the iTunes Store are all 
good sources of WebClip widgets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
Leopard even allows you to create your own Dashboard widgets! That’s right, 
this new feature is sure to be a winner amongst the In Crowd. Follow these 
steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget from your favorite Web site:
 
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
 
2. Click the Open This Page in Dashboard button on the Safari toolbar, 
which bears a pair of scissors and a dotted box.
 
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget.
 
 Most Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a page, 
so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired content.
 
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your 
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
 
 Bam! Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within Dashboard.
When you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page 
in Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit 
often.
Switching between apps with Exposé
Most MacBook owners are comfortable using the Ô+Tab keyboard shortcut 
to switch between open applications. If you’ve moved to the Mac from a PC 
running Windows, you might think this simple shortcut is all there is to it. Ah, 
dear reader, you’re in Leopard territory now!
Exposé is a rather racy-sounding feature, but (like Dashboard) it’s really all 
about convenience. If you typically run a large number of applications at the 
same time, Exposé can be a real timesaver, allowing you to quickly switch 
between a forest of different application windows (or display your Desktop 
instantly without those very same windows in the way). The feature works in 
three ways:
 
 Press the All Windows key (or key sequence) to display all your applica-
tion windows on a single screen, as shown in the truly cool Figure 5-4. 
(By default, F9 is the All Windows key.)
 
 Then just click the window that you want to make active.

88
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Figure 5-4: 
With 
Exposé, 
you can 
instantly see 
every open 
applica-
tion’s 
window(s).
 
 
 Press the Application Windows key (or key sequence) to display all 
the windows that have been opened by the active application. (By 
default, F10 is the Application Windows key.)
 
 This comes in handy with those mega-applications like Photoshop 
Elements or FileMaker Pro, in which you often have three or four win-
dows open at one time. Again, you can click the window that you want 
to make active.
 
 Press the Desktop key (or key sequence) to move all your application 
and Finder windows to the sides of your Desktop so you can access 
your Desktop icons. (The default Desktop key is F11.)
 
 After you’re done with your Desktop and you want to restore your win-
dows to their original locations, press the Desktop key (F11) again to put 
things back.
Switching between desktops with Spaces
Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applica-
tions? For example, suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing 

89
 Chapter 5: Getting to the Heart of the Leopard
job, designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop also 
includes Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often by using 
one of the techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize you 
need to schedule a meeting with others in your office by using iCal, and you 
also want to check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?
Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your graph-
ics applications, and then minimize or close them. With Leopard’s new Spaces 
feature, though, you can press the Control+← or Control+→ sequences to 
switch to a completely different “communications applications” desktop, with 
iCal and Apple Mail windows already open and in your favorite positions! 
Figure 5-5 illustrates the Spaces screen, showing two available desktops.
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important 
e-mail, simply press Control+← or Control+→ again to switch back to your 
“graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for 
GarageBand and iTunes . . . or perhaps you joined iWeb, Safari, and iPhoto as 
a “Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited? (Let’s see Windows 
Vista do that out of the box.)

With 
Spaces, 
you can

90
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Unlike Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you can use 
it. You can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and even choose 
a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within System 
Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see Chapter 6.
 
You can activate Exposé, Spaces, and Dashboard by using your mouse rather 
than the keyboard:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Exposé & Spaces icon to display the settings.
 
3. Click the desired Screen Corner pop-up menu to choose what function 
that screen corner will trigger.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to save your changes and then exit System Preferences.
 
 When you move your mouse pointer to that corner, the feature you’ve 
specified automatically kicks in.
Printing within Mac OS X
Leopard makes document printing a breeze. Because virtually all Mac print-
ers use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, setting up printing couldn’t be 
easier. Just turn on your printer and connect the USB cable between the 
printer and your MacBook; Leopard does the rest.
 
Printer manufacturers supply you with installation software that might add 
cool extra software or fonts to your system. Even if Leopard recognizes your 
USB printer immediately, I recommend that you still launch the manufactur-
er’s Mac OS X installation disc. For example, my new Epson printer came with 
new fonts and a CD/DVD label application, but I wouldn’t have ’em if I hadn’t 
installed the Epson software package.
After your printer is connected and installed, you can use the same pro-
cedure to print from within just about every Mac OS X application on the 
planet! To print with the default page layout settings — standard 81⁄2" x 11" 
paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
 
1. Within the active application, choose File➪Print or press the Ô+P 
shortcut.
 
 Mac OS X displays the Print sheet, as shown in Figure 5-6.

 From this dialog, you can
 
• Print from a different printer connected to your laptop or print over a 
network connection to a shared printer on another computer.
 
 Click the Printer pop-up menu. In this pop-up menu, Leopard dis-
plays all the printers that you can access.
 
• Check what the printed document will look like.
 
 Click Preview to open it within the very same Preview application I 
discuss earlier in this chapter.
 
 If you have to make changes to the document or you need to change 
the default print settings, click Cancel to return to your document. (You 
have to repeat Step 1 again to display the Print dialog again.)
 
If everything looks good at this point and you don’t need to change any set-
tings (like multiple copies or to print only a portion of the document), click 
Print — you’re done! If not, click the Expand button next to the Printer pop-up 
menu. (It bears a downward-pointing arrow.) Now you can proceed with these 
steps:
 
1. (Optional) For more than one copy, click in the Copies field and type 
the number of copies that you need.
 
 Collation (separating copies) is also available, and it doesn’t cost a thing!

92
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
2. (Optional) To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio 
button and then enter the starting and ending pages.
 
 To print the entire document, leave the default Pages option set to All.
 
3. (Optional) If the application offers its own print settings, such as col-
lating and grayscale printing, make any necessary changes to those 
settings.
 
 To display these application-specific settings, click the pop-up menu 
in the Print dialog and choose the desired settings pane that you need 
to adjust. (You can blissfully ignore these settings and skip this step 
entirely if the defaults are fine.)
 
4. When you’re set to go, click Print.
 
You can also save an electronic version of a document in the popular Adobe 
Acrobat PDF format from the Print dialog — without spending money on 
Adobe Acrobat. (Slick.)
 
1. Click the PDF button to display the destination pop-up menu.
 
2. Click Save as PDF.
 
 Leopard prompts you with a Save As dialog, where you can type a name 
for the PDF document and specify a location on your hard drive where 
the file should be saved.
Heck, if you like, you can even fax a PDF (with an external USB modem) or 
send it as an e-mail attachment! Just choose these options from the destina-
tion list rather than Save as PDF.

emember the old TV series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea? You always 
knew you were on the bridge of the submarine Seaview because it had 
an entire wall made up of randomly blinking lights, crewmen darting about 
with clipboards, and all sorts of strange and exotic-looking controls on 
every available surface. You could fix just about anything by looking into the 
camera with grim determination and barking out an order. After all, you were 
On The Bridge. That’s why virtually all the dialog and action inside the sub 
took place on that one (expensive) set: It was the nerve center of the ship, 
and a truly happenin’ place to be.
In the same vein, I devote this entire chapter to the System Preferences 
window and all the settings within it. After all, if you want to change how 
Leopard works or customize the features within our favorite operating 
system, this one window is the nerve center of Mac OS X, and a truly hap-
penin’ place to be. (Sorry, no built-in wall of randomly blinking lights — but 
there are exotic controls just about everywhere.)
An Explanation (In English, No Less)
The System Preferences window (as shown in Figure 6-1) is a self-contained 
beast, and you can reach it in a number of ways:
 
 Click the Apple menu (Ú) and choose the System Preferences menu item.
 
 Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock — it’s a collection of gears.

94
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Click the Apple menu (Ú), choose Dock, and then choose the Dock 
Preferences menu item.
 
 Click the Time and Date display in the Finder menu and then choose the 
Open Date and Time menu item.
 
 Control-click (or right-click) any uninhabited area of your Desktop and 
then choose Change Desktop Background.
 
 Click most of the Finder menu status icons and then choose the Open 
Preferences menu item. (This includes the Bluetooth, AirPort, Display, 
Modem, and Clock icons.)
When the System Preferences window is open, you can click any of the group 
icons to switch to that group’s pane; the entire window morphs to display the 
settings for the selected pane. For example, Figure 6-2 illustrates the Sound 
pane, which allows you to set a system alert sound, configure your MacBook’s 
built-in microphone, and choose from several different output options.
Many panes also include a number of tabbed buttons at the top — in this case, 
Sound Effects, Output, and Input. You can click these tabs to switch to another 
panel within the same pane. Many panes within System Preferences have mul-
tiple panels. This design allows our friends at Apple to group a large number of 
related settings together in the same pane (without things getting too confusing).

To return to the top-level System Preferences panel from any pane, just click 
the Show All button (top left) or press Ô+L. You can also click the familiar 
Previous and Next buttons to move backward through the panes you’ve 
already visited and then move forward again, in sequence. (Yep, these 
buttons work just like the browser controls in Safari. Sometimes life is 
funny that way.)
You won’t find an OK button that you have to click to apply any System 
Preference changes — Apple’s developers do things the right way. Your 
changes to the settings in a pane are automatically saved when you click 
Show All or when you click the Close button on the System Preferences 
window. You can also press Ô+Q to exit the window and save all your 
changes automatically . . . a favorite shortcut of mine.
 
If you see an Apply button in a pane, you can click it to immediately apply any 
changes you made, without exiting the pane. This is perfect for some settings 
that you might want to try first before you accept them, like many of the con-
trols on the Network pane. However, if you’re sure about what you changed 
and how those changes will affect your system, you don’t have to click Apply. 
Just exit the System Preferences window or click Show All as you normally 
would.
Locating That Certain Special Setting
Hey, wouldn’t it be great if you could search through all the different panes 
in System Preferences — with all those countless radio buttons, check boxes, 
and slider controls — from one place, even when you’re not quite sure 
exactly what you’re looking for?

96
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Figure 6-3 illustrates exactly that kind of activity taking place. Just click in the 
System Preferences Spotlight Search box (upper right, with the magnifying 
glass icon) and type in just about anything. For example, if you know part of 
the name of a particular setting you need to change, type that. Leopard high-
lights the System Preferences panes that might contain matching settings. 
And if you’re a Switcher from the Windows world, you can even type in what 
you might have called the same setting in Windows XP or Vista!
 
Figure 6-3: 
Searching 
for specific 
settings is a 
breeze with

The System Preferences window dims, and the group icons that might con-
tain what you’re looking for stay highlighted. Slick.
 
You can also search for System Preferences controls by using the Spotlight 
menu and Spotlight window. Find more on this cool feature in Chapter 7.
If you need to reset the Search box to try again, click the X icon that appears 
at the right side of the box to clear it.
Popular Preference Panes Explained
Time to get down to brass tacks. Open up the most often-used panes in 
System Preferences to see what magic you can perform! I won’t discuss every 
pane because I cover many of them in other chapters. (In fact, you might 

97
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
never need to open some System Preferences panes at all, like the .Mac 
pane.) However, this chapter covers just about all the settings that you’re 
likely to use on a regular basis.
The Displays pane
If you’re a heavy-duty game player or you work with applications like 
Keynote or Final Cut Pro, you probably find yourself switching the charac-
teristics of your monitor on a regular basis. To easily accomplish switching, 
visit the Displays pane (see Figure 6-4), which includes two panels:
 
 Display: Click a screen resolution to choose it from the Resolutions 
list on the left. Leopard displays the number of colors (or color depth) 
allowed at that resolution, and you can pick a color depth from the 
Colors pop-up menu. (Typically, it’s a good idea to use the highest reso-
lution and the highest number of colors.) If you have an external moni-
tor connected to your laptop, click the Detect Displays button to scan 
for that monitor. Because MacBooks running Leopard have a flat-panel 
LCD, the refresh rate is disabled. If you’re working with a projector, you 
can also use the Detect Displays button to configure external displays. 
Drag the Brightness slider to change the brightness level of your display.
 
 When you enable (mark) the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box, you 
can switch resolutions and color levels right from the Finder menu!
 
 Color: Your MacBook can use a color profile file that controls the colors 
on your display. This setting comes in handy for graphic artists and 
illustrators who need color output from their printers that closely 
matches the colors displayed by the laptop. Click the Calibrate button 
to launch the Display Calibrator, which can create a custom ColorSync 
profile and calibrate the colors that you see on your monitor.

The Desktop & Screen Saver pane
Hey, no offense to the awesome Aurora background (new with Leopard), but 
who doesn’t want to choose their own background? And what about that 
nifty screen saver you just downloaded from the Apple Web site? You can 
change both your background and your screen saver by using these options 
on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
The settings on the Desktop panel (as shown in Figure 6-5) include
 
 Current Desktop picture: To change your Desktop background, click 
a thumbnail. You can also drag a picture from a Finder window or the 
desktop and drop it into the well (the fancy Apple word for the square 
box with the sunken look). Leopard automatically updates your Desktop 
so you can see the results. To open another collection of images from 
Apple, click the desired collection folder in the list on the left of the 
panel. (I recommend the stunning images in the Nature folder.) If you 
want to open a different folder with your own images, click the Add 
button (which bears a plus sign) at the lower left of the panel and then 
navigate to that folder.
 
 Arrangement: You can automatically fit an image to your screen, tile 
your background image (repeat it across the Desktop), center it, or 
stretch it to fill the screen. Because the images from Apple are all sized 
correctly already, the Arrangement control appears only when you’re 
using your own pictures.

 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
 Change Picture: If you like a bit of automatic variety on your Desktop, 
select the Change Picture check box. You can click the accompanying 
drop-down list box to set the delay period. The images in the current 
collection or folder are then displayed in the sequence in which they 
appear in the thumbnail list.
 
 Random Order: Select this check box to throw caution utterly to the 
wind and display random screens from the current collection or folder!
The settings on the Screen Saver tab include
 
 Screen Savers: Click the screen saver that you want to display from the 
Screen Savers list. Leopard displays an animated preview of the selected 
saver on the right. You can also click the Test button to try out the screen 
saver in full-screen mode. (Move your mouse a bit to end the test.)
 
 If the selected screen saver has any settings you can change, the 
Options button displays them.
 
 Start Screen Saver: Drag this slider to choose the period of inactivity 
that triggers the screen saver. Choose Never to disable the screen saver 
entirely.
 
 For additional security, check out the Security pane in System Preferences, 
where you’ll find the Require password to wake this computer from sleep 
or screen saver check box. Enable the check box, and Leopard will require 
your user account password before allowing anyone to turn off the screen 
saver (a great idea when traveling, as you can imagine).
 
 Use Random Screen Saver: Another chance to rebel against conformity! 
Enable this check box, and Leopard picks a different screen saver each 
time.
 
 Show With Clock: Enable this check box, and Leopard adds a smart 
clock display to your screen saver. (A great help for those of us who 
spend many minutes on the phone.)
 
 Hot Corners: Click this button to display a drop-down sheet, and then 
click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners of the screen 
to select that corner as an activating hot corner. (Moving your mouse 
pointer there immediately activates the screen saver.) You can also 
specify a corner as a disabling hot corner — as long as the mouse pointer 
stays in that corner, the screen saver is disabled. Note that you can also 
set the Dashboard, Spaces, and Exposé activation corners from here. 
(Read on for the entire lowdown.)
The Exposé & Spaces pane
The pane you see in Figure 6-6 illustrates the settings that control Leopard’s 
Spaces, Dashboard, and Exposé features, which I discuss in more detail in 
Chapter 5. The settings on the Exposé tab include

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Active Screen Corners: The screen corners pop-up menus that I 
describe in the preceding section operate just like those in the Screen 
Savers panel. Click a corner’s list box to set it as
 
• An Exposé All Windows corner (displays all windows on your 
Desktop).
 
• An Exposé Application Windows corner (displays only the windows 
from the active application).
 
• An Exposé Desktop corner (moves all windows to the outside of 
the screen to uncover your Desktop).
 
• A Spaces corner (activates the Spaces Desktop selection feature).
 
• A Sleep Display corner (immediately turns off your display, putting 
your screen in Sleep mode).
 
• A Dashboard corner (displays your Dashboard widgets). Widgets 
are small applications that each perform a single task; they appear 
when you invoke the awesome power of Dashboard.
 
 These pop-up menus can also set the Screen Saver activate and disable 
hot corners.
 
 Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Pretty straightforward stuff here. Click 
each pop-up menu to set the key sequences (and mouse button settings) 
for all three Exposé functions as well as Dashboard.
 
 If you hold down a modifier key (Shift, Control, Option, or Ô) while a 
shortcut pop-up menu is open, Leopard adds that modifier key to the 
selections you can choose! (Perfect for those folks who already have the 
F11 key in use by another application. Make your Desktop shortcut key 
the Shift+F11 key sequence instead.)
One of Leopard’s hottest new features is Spaces, which is the system you 
use to configure and control multiple “prefabricated” desktops that you can 
switch between at will! The settings on the Spaces tab include
 
 Enable Spaces: Enable this check box to use Spaces. (Go figure.)
 
 Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is enabled, Leopard 
displays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using in the 
Finder menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to switch to 
another Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences pane.
 
 Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, 
click the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts with 
two desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered begin-
ning with three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which bears a 
minus sign).

101
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
 Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces 
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to 
remove a column from the grid.
 
 If you choose to remove a column or row, Leopard alerts you that the 
bindings (the specific applications linked to the deleted columns or 
rows) will be reassigned.
 
 Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button 
with the plus sign under the Application Assignments list) to add an 
application to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which desk-
top should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows next 
to the Space column for that application’s entry — just click the desired 
desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an application, 
click it in the Application Bindings list to select it and then click the 
Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).
 
 Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops; just choose 
Every Space from the pop-up menu.
 
 Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
 
 Like with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you 
can press Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys (or even a combination of 
them) while the box is open to display modified choices.

The Appearance pane
The talented Appearance pane (as shown in Figure 6-7) determines the look 
and operation of the controls that appear in application windows and Finder 
windows. It looks complex, but I cover each option here.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Appear-
ances might 
not be 
everything, 
but they’re 
easy to find 
here.
 
The settings include
 
 Appearance: Click this pop-up menu to specify the color Leopard uses 
for buttons, menus, and windows.
 
 Highlight Color: Click this pop-up menu to choose the color that high-
lights selected text in fields, pop-up menus, and drop-down list boxes.
 
 Place Scroll Arrows: Select a radio button here to determine whether 
the arrows that control the scroll bar in a window appear together 
at the bottom of the scroll bar, or separately at the top and bottom 
of the scroll bar.
 
 Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Leopard scrolls to the next or pre-
vious page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. Select 
the Jump to Here radio button to scroll the document to the approxi-
mate position in relation to where you clicked. (Smooth scrolling slows 
down scrolling, which some people prefer.)
 
 You can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-
clicking the window’s title bar. To enable this feature, mark the Minimize 
When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box.

103
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
 Number of Recent Items: By default, Leopard displays ten recent appli-
cations, documents, and servers within Recent Items in the Apple menu. 
Need more? Just click the corresponding pop-up menu and specify up to 
50 items.
 
 Font Smoothing Style: This feature performs a little visual magic that 
makes the text on your monitor or flat-panel look more like the text on 
a printed page. Most MacBook owners should choose Automatic or 
Medium (for a typical flat-panel LCD display).
 
 Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text 
smoothing doesn’t help fonts look any smoother onscreen. By default, 
any font displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is a good 
choice for a MacBook with a flat-panel LCD screen.
The Energy Saver pane
I’m an environmentalist — it’s surprising how many techno-types are col-
ored green — so these two panels here are pretty doggone important. When 
you use them correctly, you not only conserve battery power but also even 
invoke the Power of Leopard to automatically start and shut down your 
laptop whenever you like!
Laptop owners get special treatment within Leopard — notice the Settings 
For and Optimization pop-up menus at the top of the pane, which don’t 
appear if you’re using a mere desktop Mac. These menus allow you to quickly 
switch between different settings for operation with a battery or AC adapter, 
making it easy to fine-tune your power use wherever you may find yourself! 
You can choose from two energy use settings (Battery or Power Adapter) 
and three optimization modes (Better Battery Life, Normal, or Better 
Performance). If you tweak the settings on this pane yourself, Leopard auto-
matically assigns you a Custom optimization mode (perfect for those presen-
tations where you need a longer screen saver delay).
 
Naturally, if you plug your MacBook into a convenient AC outlet, the Settings 
menu automatically switches to Power Adapter. When you’re running on bat-
tery power, System Preferences switches to Battery settings. (You can manu-
ally change at any time, however, if you need your laptop’s best performance 
on the road, or if you want to go green and conserve electricity while using 
your power adapter.)
The panels (as shown in Figure 6-8) include
 
 Sleep: To save that precious battery power, drag the Put the Computer 
to Sleep When It Is Inactive For slider to a delay period that triggers 
sleep mode when you’re away from the keyboard for a significant period 

104
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
of time. (I prefer 30 minutes.) If your laptop must always remain alert 
and you want to disable sleep mode entirely, choose Never. You can set 
the delay period for blanking your monitor separately from the sleep set-
ting with the Put the Display to Sleep When the Computer Is Inactive For 
slider. To conserve the maximum juice and cut down on wear, enable 
the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible check box to power-
down your hard drives when they’re not needed. (This might cause a 
delay of a second or two while loading or saving files because the drives 
must spin back up.)
 
 You can set Leopard to start or shut down your laptop at a scheduled 
time. Click the Schedule button and then select the desired schedule 
(the Start Up or Wake check box and the Shut Down/Sleep pop-up menu) 
to enable them. Set the trigger time by clicking the up and down arrows 
next to the time display for each schedule. Click OK to return to the 
Energy Saver pane.
 
 Options: By default, your laptop’s display will dim to indicate that sleep 
mode is approaching, but you can disable the Automatically Reduce 
the Brightness of the Display check box to maintain full brightness until 
sleep mode actually kicks in. To reduce display power consumption, you 
can enable the Slightly Dim the Display When Using This Power Source 
check box. You can also enable or disable the Finder menu Battery 
meter from the Options panel.

 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
The Dock pane
I’ll come clean: I think the Dock is the best thing since sliced bread! (I wonder 
what people referred to before sliced bread was invented?) You can use the 
settings, as shown in Figure 6-9, to configure the Dock’s behavior until it fits 
your personality like a glove:
 
 Size: Pretty self-explanatory. Just drag the slider to change the scale of 
the Dock.
 
 Magnification: When you select this check box, each icon in your Dock 
swells like a puffer fish when you move your mouse cursor over it. 
(Just how much it magnifies is determined by the Magnification slider.) 
I really like this feature because I resize my Dock smaller, and I have a 
large number of Dock icons.
 
 Position on Screen: Select a radio button here to position the Dock on 
the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
 
 Minimize Using: Leopard includes two cool animations that you can 
choose from when shrinking a window to the Dock (and expanding it 
back to the Desktop). Click the Minimize Using pop-up menu to specify 
the genie-in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect.
 
 If animation isn’t your bag or you want to speed up the graphics perfor-
mance of an older G4 iBook or PowerBook, you can turn off these mini-
mizing effects.
 
 Animate Opening Applications: Are you into aerobics? How about punk 
rock and slam dancing? Active souls who like animation likely get a kick 
out of the bouncing application icons in the Dock. They indicate that 
you’ve launched an application and that it’s loading. You can turn off 
this bouncing behavior by disabling this check box.
 
 Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Select this check box, and the 
Dock disappears until you need it. (Depending on the size of your Dock, 
the Desktop that you gain can be significant.) To display a hidden Dock, 
move your mouse pointer over the corresponding edge of the Desktop.

106
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
The Sharing pane
So you’re in a neighborly mood, and you want to share your toys with others 
on your local wired or wireless network. Perhaps you’d like to start your own 
Web site, or protect yourself against the Bad Guys on the Internet. All these 
fun diversions are available from the Sharing pane in System Preferences, as 
shown in Figure 6-10.
Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your 
MacBook during the installation process. Your current network name is listed 
in the Computer Name text field.
Each entry in the Service list controls a specific type of sharing, including 
Screen Sharing, File Sharing (with other Macs and PCs running Windows), 
Printer Sharing, Web Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management (using 
Apple Remote Desktop), Remote Apple Events, Xgrid Sharing, Internet 
Sharing, and Bluetooth Sharing. To turn on any of these services, enable the 
On check box for that service. To turn off a service, click the corresponding 
On check box to disable it.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only those 
services that you actually use because each service you enable automatically 
opens your Leopard firewall for that service. (Chapter 17 discusses your fire-
wall in more detail.) A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
 
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.™
 
When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing pane 
changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular service. To 
display all the details on these options, click the Help button (question mark) 
at the lower-right corner of the System Preferences dialog.
The Time Machine pane
Mac users are excited about the new Time Machine automatic backup feature 
that debuts with Leopard, and you can easily configure how Time Machine 
handles your backups from this pane (as shown in Figure 6-11). Chapter 21 
covers how to use Time Machine. Of course, you need an external hard drive 
(or a Time Capsule wireless backup station) for the best backup security. 
Note that Time Machine won’t work with your CD or DVD rewriteable drive: 
You must use a hard drive.

107
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
Figure 6-10: 
Use con-
trols on the 
Sharing 
pane to 
share your 
toys.
 
 
You can actually use a second partition on your existing internal hard drive to 
hold your Time Machine data, but guess what happens if your internal hard 
drive is hit with a hardware failure. You lose both your original data and your 
backup in one fell swoop! For this reason, I strongly recommend that you add 
an external hard drive to your MacBook for use with Time Machine. (I don’t 
know why Apple even made this an option. Sigh.)
 
Figure 6-11: 
Put Time 
Machine to 
work, and

To enable Time Machine, click the big On sliding switch and then select a 
disk (or partition) that will hold your Time Machine backup data. Click the 
desired backup location, and then click Use for Backup. It’s really that simple!
 
Your Mac must be turned on to allow a Time Machine backup to run.

108
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
By default, Time Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system; 
however, you might not need to back up some hard drives or folders on 
your laptop. To save time and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you 
to exclude specific drives and folders from the backup process. Click the 
Options button; then click the Add button (with the plus sign) to select the 
drives or folders you want to exclude, and they’ll appear in the Do Not Back 
Up list.
 
To remove an exclusion, select it in the list and click the Delete button (with 
the minus sign); note the Total Included figure increases, and Time Machine 
adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.

hat would you say if I told you that you could search your entire 
system for every single piece of data connected with a person — 
and in only the short time it takes to type that person’s name? And I’m not 
just talking about files and folders that might include that person’s name. I 
mean every e-mail message and every iCal calendar event that references 
that person — and even that person’s Address Book card to boot? Heck, 
how about if that search could dig up every occurrence of the person’s name 
inside your electronic PDF documents?
You’d probably say, “That makes for good future tech — I’ll bet I can do that 
in five or ten years. It’ll take Apple at least that long to do it . . . and just in 
time for me to buy a new MacBook! (Harrumph.)”
Don’t be so hasty: You can do all this, right now. The technology is the Mac 
OS X feature named Spotlight, built right into Leopard. In this chapter, I show 
you how to use it like a Mac power guru. I also show you how to take advan-
tage of Internet search widgets you can display within Dashboard. (From 
what I hear, there’s good stuff on the Internet, too.)
A Not-So-Confusing Introduction 
to Spotlight
Invoking the magic of Spotlight is a snap. As you can see in Figure 7-1, the 
Spotlight search field always hangs out on the right side of the Finder menu 
bar. You can either click once on the magnifying glass icon or just press 
Ô+spacebar. Either way, Leopard displays the Spotlight search box.

110
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Figure 7-1: 
Soon to be 
a very good 
friend of 
yours — the 
Spotlight 
search box.
 
Spotlight search box
Spotlight works by indexing — in other words, searching for and keep-
ing track of keywords within your files. (In case you’ve never heard the 
term before, a keyword is a word in the title or innards of a document that 
describes the contents, like leopard, music, or soda. That last one turns up a 
lot in my documents.)
In fact, Leopard indexes the contents of your MacBook’s hard drives into one 
huge file, which it constantly maintains while you create new files and modify 
existing files. Leopard can search this index file in a fraction of a second 
after you enter your search criteria. Your index file contains all sorts of data, 
including quite a bit of information from inside various documents: hence, 
Spotlight’s ability to present matching data inside your files and application 
records.
 
When you first boot Leopard, it spends anywhere from a few minutes to an 
hour or two creating the initial Spotlight index file. A blue dot appears in the 
middle of the magnifying glass icon while indexing is underway. Creating this 
full index happens only once, so it’s no great burden to bear.
You can search for any string of text characters in Spotlight, and you’ll 
be surprised at everything this plucky feature will search. For example, 
Spotlight searches through your Address Book contacts, Mail messages, iCal 

111
 Chapter 7: Sifting through Your Stuff
calendars, iChat transcripts, temporary Web page cache, and even System 
Preferences! Yep, you can even use it to find specific settings in all those 
System Preferences panes, such as printer sharing or Dashboard. Of course, 
Spotlight includes matching files and folders — like that other operating 
system — but it does it in the blink of an eye.
Spotlight matches all the items that include all your search text: Therefore, 
if you enter just the word horse, you’re likely to get far more matches than if 
you enter a more-restrictive word string, such as horse show ticket.
 
If you add metadata to your documents — such as a Comment field in a Word 
document (which you can display in the Get Info dialog box) — Spotlight 
matches that information as well. Other recognized file formats include iWork 
documents, Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and third-party appli-
cations that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
Searching with Spotlight
To begin a Spotlight topic search, click within the Spotlight box and start 
typing. As soon as your finger presses the first key, you’ll see matching items 
start to appear. Check out Figure 7-2, in which I typed only a single character 
(L). No need to press Return to start the process, by the way. When you type 
more characters, Spotlight’s results are updated in real time to reflect those 
more-restrictive qualifiers. For example, if I had typed three characters — 
say, Leo — my results would be far more specific: everything from Leopard to 
Leonard Bernstein.
Spotlight displays what it considers the top 20 matching items within the 
Spotlight menu itself. These most relevant hits are arranged into categories, 
such as Documents, Images, and Folders. You can change the order in which 
categories appear (via the Spotlight pane within System Preferences, which I 
cover a bit later in this chapter).
 
With its internal magic, Spotlight presents the category Top Hit (with what it 
considers the single, most-relevant match) at the top of the search results, as 
also shown in Figure 7-2. You’ll find that the Top Hit is often just what you’re 
looking for. To open or launch the Top Hit item from the keyboard, click the 
entry or press the down-arrow key (↓) to select Top Hit; then press Return.
Didn’t find what you were after? Click the X icon that appears at the right side 
of the Spotlight box to reset the search box and then start over.
If all you know about the item you’re searching for is its file type, prefix a key-
word with the text kind: in front of the file type in the Searchlight field. For 
example, say you’re searching for a QuickTime movie, but you don’t know the 
title. In this case, you’d type kind:movies. This trick also works with image 
files (kind:images), contacts (kind:contacts), applications (kind:applications), 
and audio files (kind:music), too.

112
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Figure 7-2: 
A Spotlight

takes as 
little as one

Here’s another trick that’s built into Spotlight: You can type in a date a file was 
created or received, such as modified:=>01/01/08, to match all items modi-
fied on or after January 1, 2008. Heck, you can even combine appended cri-
teria, such as kind:music created:07/18/07. Note: Be sure to include a space 
between the criteria. Spotlight then matches every audio file that was created 
on that date. One-hundred-percent sassy!
To allow even greater flexibility in your searches, Apple uses those help-
ful Boolean search friends that you might already be familiar with: AND, OR, 
and NOT (separated by spaces). For example, in Leopard, you can perform 
Spotlight searches, such as
 
 Horse AND cow: Collects all references to both those barnyard animals 
into one search
 
 Batman OR Robin: Returns all references to either Batman or Robin, but 
not both
 
 Apple NOT PC: Displays all references to Apple that don’t include any 
information on dastardly PCs

113
 Chapter 7: Sifting through Your Stuff
Working with matching stuff
After you run a fruitful search, and Spotlight finds the proverbial needle in 
your system’s haystack, what’s next?
Just click the item — that’s all it takes. Depending on the type of item, 
Leopard does one of four things:
 
 Launches an application
 
 Opens a specific pane in System Preferences (if the match is the name of 
a setting or contained in the text on a Preferences pane)
 
 Opens a document or data item, such as an Address Book card
 
 Displays a folder within a Finder window
To see all sorts of useful info about each Spotlight menu item — otherwise 
known as filtering — click the Show All item (above the Top Hit listing; refer 
to Figure 7-2) to expand your Spotlight menu into the Results window, as 
shown in Figure 7-3. From the keyboard, you can press the Results window 
shortcut key, which you can set from System Preferences (more on this in a 
page or two).
How secure is Spotlight?
Say you’re sharing your Mac as a multiuser 
computer, or accessing other Macs remotely. 
What about all those files, folders, contacts, 
and events that you don’t want to appear in 
Spotlight? Can other folks search for and access 
your personal information through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by 
Spotlight are controlled by file and folder per-
missions as well as your account login, just like 
the applications that create and display your 
personal data. For example, you can’t access 
other users’ calendars by using iCal, and they 
can’t see your Mail messages. Only you have 
access to your data, and only after you log in 
with your username and password. Spotlight 
works the same way. If a user doesn’t normally 
have access to an item, it simply doesn’t appear 
when that user performs a Spotlight search. (In 
other words, only you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders 
and disks from your own Spotlight searches if 
necessary. Perhaps you’d prefer keeping your 
tax and financial records away from Spotlight’s 
all-searching eye? Check out the last section of 
this chapter for details on setting private loca-
tions on your system.

ways to 
group and

matches.
 
To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the Spotlight Results 
window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the button with the 
plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click the pop-up menus 
to choose from criteria, such as the type of file, text content, or the location 
on your system (such as your hard drive, your Home folder, or a network 
server). You can also filter your results listing by the date when the items 
were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click the plus and minus 
buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To save a custom filter 
that you created, click Save.
After you locate the item you want, click it to open, launch, or display it, just 
like you would in the Spotlight menu.
Tweaking Spotlight in System Preferences
The System Preferences window boasts a Spotlight pane, which you can use 
to customize what search matches you see and how they are presented. To 
adjust these settings, click the System Preferences icon on the Dock (look 
for the Three Gears of Justice) and then click the Spotlight icon (under 
Personal).
Configuring the Search Results settings
Figure 7-4 illustrates the Search Results tab of the Spotlight Preferences pane. 
From here, you can
 
 Pick your categories. To disable a category (typically because you don’t 
use those types of files), select the check box next to the unnecessary 
category to clear it.

115
 Chapter 7: Sifting through Your Stuff
 
 Specify the order that categories appear within Spotlight. Drag the 
categories into the order that you want them to appear in the Spotlight 
menu and Results window.
 
 Select new Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard 
shortcuts. In fact, you can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut, as 
you like. Click the pop-up menu to choose a key combination.

Marking stuff off-limits
Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 7-5) to add disks and folders that 
should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. The disks and folders 
that you add to this list won’t appear even if they actually match your search 
string. This safeguard can come in handy for organizations (such as hospi-
tals) that are required by law to protect their patient or client data. However, 
you can select a removable hard drive here, which is often stored in a safe 
after business hours.
To add a private location, click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) and 
navigate to the desired location. Then click the location to select it and click 
Choose.
 
If you already have the location open in a Finder window, you also can drag 
folders or disks directly from the window and drop them into the list.

Other Search Tools Are Available, Too
The Finder window toolbar has featured a Search box for a few years now 
(and Leopard includes a Find dialog), but even the older Search features 
within Leopard have been updated to take advantage of Spotlight technology. 
Now you can even use file types (such as image or movie) and relative time 
periods (such as yesterday and last week) in the Finder window Search box 
and Find displays!
Typically, I use the Finder window Search box if I need to do a simple file or 
folder name search: It works the same as using the Spotlight search field. 
Just begin typing. To reset the field and start anew, click the X button in the 
Search box. To choose a specific location for your search — say, your Home 
folder or a hard drive volume — click the desired button along the top of the 
Search results display. The Finder window automatically turns into a Results 
display.
Leopard also includes the oldest Search method in the book: the Find dis-
play. (It used to be a dialog all by itself, but Find controls are now displayed 
in the Finder window, so it’s more of an extension to the Finder window.) 
Choose File➪Find or press Ô+F to display the Find controls. From here, you 
can click pop-up menus to choose a specific filename or portion of a filename. 
Other modifiers include the file type, content, file size, and the most recent 
date when the file was opened. Again, click the location buttons at the top of 
the window to choose where to search.

117
 Chapter 7: Sifting through Your Stuff
 
For a truly mind-blowing list of modifiers, click the Other item in the modifier 
menu. You’ll find you can search for all photos where a certain shutter speed 
was used, or all files that are read-only. Heck, I sometimes use this expanded 
list to search for documents that use a certain font!
The Find display, however, is a little more sophisticated than the toolbar Search 
box. You can click the plus (+) button next to a search criterion field in the Find 
display to add another field, allowing for matches based on more than one condi-
tion. Click the minus (–) button next to a search criterion field to remove it.
After you find a match, both older Search methods work the same: Click 
the item once to display its location, or double-click it to launch or open it. 
Files can also be moved or copied, respectively, from the Results and Find 
displays with the standard drag or Option+drag methods. You can return to 
the more mundane Finder window display by clicking the Back button on the 
toolbar to erase the contents of the Spotlight box.
 
These older Search methods can also do one thing that Spotlight doesn’t offer: 
You can use them to create a new Smart Folder, which is a folder with contents 
that Leopard automatically updates according to the criteria you set — the 
same modifiers I discuss earlier.
Click the Save button in either the Finder window Search Results or Find dis-
play. You’re prompted to specify the name and location for the new Smart 
Folder and whether it should appear in the Finder window Sidebar.
After you create the folder, Leopard automatically updates the contents of 
the Smart Folder with whatever items match the criteria you saved. You 
never have to search using the same text or criteria again because the search 
is saved as part of the Smart Folder! (Each icon in a Smart Folder is a link to 
the actual file or folder — just like an alias — so nothing gets moved, and 
no extra space is wasted with multiple copies of the same items.) In other 
words, you can work with the files and folders inside a Smart Folder as if they 
were the actual items themselves.
With Widgets, the Internet 
Is Your Resource
No chapter on searching within Mac OS X would be complete without the 
Internet resources available through your Leopard Dashboard. (I describe 
widgets in illuminating detail in Chapter 5.) Figure 7-6 illustrates many of 
these widgets:
 
 Dictionary: This multipurpose widget can display the Oxford American 
dictionary or thesaurus entry for the word you enter.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Weather: Check out the six-day forecast for a specific ZIP code or 
city/state combination at a glance.
 
 To enter the location data, click the tiny i button that appears when you 
mouse over the right corner of the widget. This trick works with just 
about every widget, allowing you to set any options it offers.
 
 Flight Tracker: Keep tabs on the arrival and destination time for the 
flight you specify.
 
 Google: Yep, it’s a shortcut to the King of all Internet search engines. 
Just type in the words you want to search for and then press Return. 
The widget automatically launches Safari with the results!
 
 Business: Put your local Yellow Pages to work by typing in a business 
name or category. This widget displays matching telephone numbers 
and addresses. Click an entry to get directions or a map from the Web.
 
Okay, I know you’re going to roll your eyes, but I have to remind you that you 
need an Internet connection to use these widgets. Otherwise, Business and 
Flight Tracker are about as useful as a pair of swim fins in the Sahara Desert.
Naturally, you’ll find countless other Internet-enabled widgets on the Apple 
Web site, in the Download area. For all the details on adding built-in widgets 
to your Dashboard, visit Chapter 5.

L
ooking for that massive Microsoft monster of a Web browser on your 
MacBook? You know, the one that practically everyone uses in the 
Windows world. What’s it called? I forget the name.
You see, I use a MacBook Pro, and I proudly surf the Web via a lean, mean — 
and very fast — browser application. That’s Safari, of course, and it just keeps 
getting better with each new version of Mac OS X. It doesn’t matter whether 
you’re working wirelessly from a hotel room or safely ensconced in your 
office: Safari delivers the Web the right way, without the wait.
If you need a guide to Safari, this is your chapter. Sure, you can start using it 
immediately, but wouldn’t you rather read a few pages in order to surf like a 
power user?
It’s Not Just Another Web Browser
Figure 8-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from 
the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon (which looks like a compass dial) 
within your Applications folder.

Figure 8-1: 
The Web 
doesn’t get

the default 
Safari 
window.
 
Bookmarks bar
Content window
Status bar
Toolbar
Major sections of the Safari window include
 
 The Toolbar: You’ll find the most often-used commands on this toolbar 
for everyday tasks, such as navigation, adding bookmarks, and search-
ing Google. Plus, here, you can type or paste the address for Web sites 
that you’d like to visit. You can hide the Toolbar to open up more real 
estate in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden 
mode, press Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or choose 
View➪Hide/Show Toolbar.
 
 The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump 
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click. I show you later, 
in the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks,” how to add and remove 
sites from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you can 
toggle the display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/Show 
Bookmarks Bar, or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.
 
 The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you waded through all 
the pre-game show and reached the area where Web pages are actually 
displayed. Like any other window, the Content window can be scrolled; 
when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail (minimized) 
image of the Content window.
 
 The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons 
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy for you to move 
from one area of a site to another or to a completely different site.

123
 Chapter 8: Taking Your Laptop on Safari!
 
 The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the 
mouse pointer is currently resting upon, like the address for a link or the 
name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page 
is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash).
Visiting Web Sites
Sure, you’re likely saying, “Mark, I already know this stuff. I can operate a 
Web browser blindfolded — while listening to The Best of Air Supply, even.” I 
agree wholeheartedly, but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just 
not be aware of all the myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web 
page from any of the following methods:
 
 Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Toolbar and then press 
Return.
 
 If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that 
you already visited, it helps by completing the address for you. If this is 
a new site, just keep typing.
 
 Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
 
 Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you 
specify.
 
 More on this in the section, “Putting Down Roots with a New Home 
Page,” later in this chapter.
 
 Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
 
 Click a page link within another Web page.
 
 Use the Google box in the Toolbar.
 
 Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and 
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on 
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under 
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.
com is the preeminent search site on the Web. People use Google to find 
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
 
 Click a Safari page icon on the Dock or in a Finder window.
 
 For example, Mac OS X sports an icon in the default Dock that takes 
you to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your 
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the 
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
 
 This trick works only on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical 
line.

124
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with 
the Safari logo. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to restore the page to its full 
glory.
Basic Navigation While on Safari
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one page 
to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding the rest. 
However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need to return to 
where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home page. Safari 
offers these navigational controls on the Toolbar:
 
 Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to 
return to the last page that you visited. Additional clicks take you to pre-
vious pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t 
visited at least two sites.
 
 Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the 
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or 
through the pages) where you were, in forward order. The Forward 
button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
 
 Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your 
home page.
 
 Not all these buttons and controls might appear on your Toolbar. To 
display or hide Toolbar controls, choose View➪Customize Toolbar. The 
sheet that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet within 
a Finder window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to your 
Toolbar, or drag a control that you don’t want from the Toolbar to the 
sheet.
 
 AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at 
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks 
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can 
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences 
and the clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
 
 To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any personal information to 
any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use this 
feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the padlock 
icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the site’s 
Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be 
treated.
 
 Text Size: Use this to shrink or expand the text on the page, offering 
smaller, space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, 
easier-to-read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which 
is labeled with a small and large letter A.

125
 Chapter 8: Taking Your Laptop on Safari!
 
 Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh 
(reload) the contents of the current page. Although most pages remain 
static, some pages change their content at regular intervals or after you 
fill out a form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy 
arrow), you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every 
hour or so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the 
Reload button turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and 
you can click it to stop the loading of the content from the current 
page. This is a real boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can 
happen when you’re trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site 
(especially if you’re using a dialup modem connection to the Internet). 
Using Stop is also handy if a page has a number of very large graphics 
that are going to take a long time to load.
 
 Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget 
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts 
you to choose which clickable section of the page to be included within 
the widget’s borders (like the local radar map on your favorite weather 
Web site). Click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with your new 
widget. (More on widgets in Chapter 5.)
 
 Add Bookmark: Click this Toolbar button (which carries a plus sign) to 
add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More on this in 
a tad.)
 
 Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box, type text 
that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine, and then 
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click 
the down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari 
window. Dig that crazy printer icon!
 
 Report Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button makes 
it easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display 
properly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs: hence, 
the name.) When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the 
settings shown in Figure 8-2; there, you can enter a short description of 
the problem that you’re having. (I also enable the Send Screen Shot of 
Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes to give 
the Apple folks more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) Then 
click the Submit button to send the bug report to Apple.

Putting Down Roots with a 
New Home Page
Choosing a home page (that’s the page that initially appears when you launch 
Safari) is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your Web surfing, espe-
cially if you’re using a dialup modem connection. However, a large percent-
age of the Mac owners with whom I’ve talked have never set their own home 
page, simply using the default home page provided by their browser. With 
Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare your own free-
dom to choose your own home page:
 
1. Display the Web page you want as your new home page, in Safari.
 
 
I recommend electing a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popular 
site.
 
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
3. Click the General button.
 
 You see the settings shown in Figure 8-3.
 
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
 
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and 
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a 
blank page.
 
 This is the fastest choice of all for a home page (and a good choice for 
those using a dialup modem connection because then Safari doesn’t 
have to download anything upfront).
 
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.

Lean, fast, and mean — That’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want 
you to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary or 
really simple syndication) pages! RSS Web 
sites display updated information by using a 
shortened list format, rather like a newspaper 
headline, without unnecessary graphics or 
silly advertisements. You can tell when a Web 
site has RSS pages available because Safari 
displays an RSS icon at the right side of the 
Address box. (When you click the RSS icon, 
the Web address switches to a feed:// 
prefix — another indication that you’re not in 
Kansas reading HTML pages anymore.)
To display more information about a news 
item on an RSS page, click the item headline. 
Safari opens the corresponding Web page — 
yep, once again you’re back in the world of 
HTML — where you can read the full story. To 
return to the RSS feed, click the Back button on 
the Toolbar. Naturally, RSS feed pages can be 
bookmarked. In fact, Apple gives you a number 
of RSS sites that you can explore immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose 
Safari➪Preferences and then click the RSS 
tab. By default, Safari checks for updated RSS 
headlines on your bookmarked feeds every 30 
minutes, but you can change this to an hourly or 
daily check. (Of course, you can also check for 
updates manually by reloading the RSS page, just 
like you would any other Web page.) New articles 
can be assigned any color you like, and you can 
specify the amount of time an item should remain 
on the RSS page after it’s published.

128
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. When you set 
bookmarks in Safari, you can immediately jump from one site to another with 
a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the Bookmarks bar. 
(The Bookmarks menu opens up in a separate pane on the left side of the 
Safari window, and the Bookmarks bar appears right below the Toolbar: your 
choice!)
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the 
following:
 
 Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 
 Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
 
 Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the book-
mark and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the 
Bookmarks menu).
 
 Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Toolbar to the 
Bookmarks bar.
 
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note 
that doing this adds only a bookmark for the page corresponding to the link — 
not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark
 
 Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
 
 If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this 
section, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its con-
tents and then click the bookmark.
 
 Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
 
 If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the 
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the 
buttons.
 
 Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small, 
opened book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired 
bookmark.
 
 The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 8-4 appears, where you 
can review each collection of bookmarks at leisure.

129
 Chapter 8: Taking Your Laptop on Safari!
 
Figure 8-4: 
The 
Bookmarks 
window 
puts all your 
bookmarks 
within easy 
reach.
 
 
 The more bookmarks that you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks 
menu and the Bookmarks window become. To keep your bookmarks 
organized, choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a 
name for the new folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks 
into collections, which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks 
window (or as separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You 
can drag bookmarks into the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and 
then press Delete.
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download 
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, you 
typically just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari 
takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, which keeps 
you updated with the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading, 
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status 
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be 
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.

130
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to your Mac OS X Downloads 
folder on the Dock, which I like and use. To specify the location where down-
loaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them automati-
cally with an antivirus program — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
2. Click the General tab (refer to Figure 8-3) and then click the Save 
Downloaded Files To pop-up menu.
 
3. Choose Other.
 
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
 
5. Click the Select button.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your mouse 
pointer over the image and hold down Control while you click (or right-click, 
if you’ve got the button to spare). Then choose Save Image As from the 
pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts you for the location where you 
want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe — 
things such as movies, text files, and PDF files that are very unlikely to 
store a virus or a damaging macro. By default, the Open “Safe” files After 
Downloading check box is enabled on the General pane. However, if you’re 
interested in preventing anything you download from running until you man-
ually check it with your antivirus application, you can disable the check box 
and breathe easy.
 
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtually 
any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve downloaded 
a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display it, try 
loading the file within QuickTime. QuickTime is the Swiss Army knife of multi-
media players, and it can recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image 
formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the 
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date 
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that page 
you forgot to bookmark!

131
 Chapter 8: Taking Your Laptop on Safari!
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an 
address that you’re typing. That’s the feature I mention in the earlier section, 
“Visiting Web Sites.”
If you’re worried about security and you’d rather not keep track of where 
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file in 
the upcoming section, “Handling ancient history.”
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and orga-
nize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit of 
comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online 
stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a 
tab representing the new page appears under the Bookmarks bar. (Choose 
File➪New Tab or press Ô+T to work the same magic.) Just click the tab to 
switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert to business as 
usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the new page.) 
Figure 8-5 illustrates a number of pages that I opened in Safari, using tabs.
To turn on tabbed browsing, choose Safari➪Preferences to display the 
Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, select the Ô-Click Opens a 
Link in a New Tab check box to enable it. After you turn on tabs, your brows-
ing experience will never be the same.
 
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button 
next to the tab’s title.
Searching for pointed sewing implements in a haystack
Looking for a certain word or phrase on a huge 
Web page that seems to be 47 screens long? 
Don’t despair! You can always press Ô+F (or 
choose Edit➪Find➪Find) to display the Find 
bar (which appears directly under the Safari 
Toolbar). Type the word or phrase that you’re 
looking for in the Find box — no need to press 
Return — and Safari highlights any matches 
that it finds!
Click the Next button in the Find bar to advance 
to each spot within the page in order, all the 
way to the bottom of the page. To search 
upward to the top of the page, click Previous. 
When you’re finished searching, click the Done 
button to banish the Find bar.
Convenient, indeed. Consider that needle 
found!

Saving Web Pages
If you encounter a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to disk in 
its entirety as a Web archive (which stores all the page content, including the 
text and images). Follow these steps:
 
1. Display the desired page.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As, or press Ô+S.
 
3. In the Export As text field, type a name for the saved page.
 
4. From the Where field, navigate to the location where you want to 
store the file on your system.
 
 To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system, 
click the button with the down arrow.
 
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved 
page.
 
 Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire 
page and can be displayed just as you see it (even if your MacBook no 
longer has an Internet connection). However, if you want to save just the 
HTML source code, choose Page Source.

133
 Chapter 8: Taking Your Laptop on Safari!
 
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
 
 After the Save file is created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
 
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of back-
ground and text colors might conspire together to render your printed copy 
practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale setting 
(if it has one). Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select the text 
on the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word or Pages, 
where you can print the page on a less offensive background (while still keep-
ing the text formatting largely untouched).
 
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link to 
the page, which is faster to send over a dialup Internet connection — choose 
File➪Mail Contents of this Page/Mail Link to this Page. (From the keyboard, 
press Ô+I to send the contents in an e-mail message, or press Ô+Shift+I to 
send a link in e-mail.) Mail loads automatically, complete with a prepared 
e-mail message. Just address it to the recipients and then click Send!
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security, 
both against outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around your 
MacBook. Hence, this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
 
Although diminutive, the tiny padlock icon that appears in the top-right corner 
of the Safari window when you’re connected to a secure Web site means a 
great deal! A secure site encrypts the information that you send and receive, 
making it much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain things like 
credit card numbers and personal information. Of course, the padlock doesn’t 
ensure that you’re on a “good” Web site — plenty of objectionable sites want 
your money as well — but at least you can be certain that your personal and 
financial information won’t be intercepted in transit between your MacBook 
and the site.
 
Never — I mean never — enter any valuable personal or financial information 
on a Web page unless you see the secure connection padlock symbol.™
This type of information includes
 
 Obvious things, such as your credit card number, address, or telephone 
number
 
 Not-so-obvious things, such as your Social Security number or a login/
password combination

134
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
If a site doesn’t provide a secure connection and asks you for personal infor-
mation, find another spot in cyberspace to do your business. Your identity 
should remain yours.
 
It’s always a good idea to restrict your Web shopping to your home network. 
For example, I don’t use airport or coffee shop wireless networks when 
I’m sending credit card or personal information across the Internet. Why? 
Because the “open” (as in unencrypted) architecture of these public networks 
can allow others to intercept the data that you send and receive. Therefore, 
I recommend that you use a public wireless network for simple Web surfing, 
but save the important stuff for your home or office. (You can find more infor-
mation on wireless networking in Chapter 17.)
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site 
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site 
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such 
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the offer-
ings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file 
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the 
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t 
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal 
information. Also, if you do a large amount of surfing, cookies can occupy a 
significant amount of your hard drive space over time. (Not to mention that 
some cookies have highly suggestive names, which could lead to all sorts of 
conclusions. End of story.)
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only from 
the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or 
CAP, for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Security button.
 
 Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 8-6.

Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and 
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files 
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint). 
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just 
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to 
clean up your cache.

Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints 
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the 
History menu, choose History➪Clear History.
The latest version of Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to 
retain entries in your History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click 
the General tab, and then click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to 
specify the desired amount of time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly, 
biweekly, monthly, or yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up 
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to 
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block 
Pop-Up Windows is checked. (If it’s not checked, click the menu item to 
toggle the menu item on.)
 
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does 
something constructive with pop-up windows, like present a download or 
login prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press 
Ô+Shift+K to toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up blocking 
back on after you’ve finished with the site.

R
eaders often ask me to name my favorite reasons why they should 
switch — that is, why should a Windows user who thinks all is well 
move to the Apple universe? Of course, I always mention the superior hard-
ware and how much of a better job Leopard does as an operating system. But 
here’s my favorite selling point: “Apple simply does things right the first time, 
and everyone else plays catch-up.”
And then I pose this question: “What if you could reach a hard drive with 5GB 
of your files over any Internet connection — anywhere in the world — and 
it just showed up on your Desktop automatically?” Usually, I get a thoughtful 
silence after that one, and another person decides to learn more — about 
Apple’s .Mac online hosting service, that is. In this chapter, I save you the 
trouble of researching all the benefits of .Mac. Heck, that’s one of the reasons 
why you bought this book, right?
Where Exactly Is My .Mac Stuff Stored?
Yep, that’s the question everyone asks. Best that I answer this one first.
I’ll begin with a definition. The online hard drive offered to .Mac subscribers 
(read about subscribing in the following section) is an iDisk, and it’s well inte-
grated into Mac OS X. In fact, if you didn’t know the background, you might 
think that iDisk were simply another internal hard drive. Figure 9-1 illustrates 
my iDisk icon on my Desktop. The Finder window displays the contents; 
notice the folders visible there. (More on these folders later in the chapter.)

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
Figure 9-1: 
My iDisk 
at work. 
Looks like 
a normal 
hard drive, 
doesn’t it?
 
iDisk icon
The files that I add to my iDisk are stored on an Apple server, location 
unknown. Literally. The physical storage (a massive file server that holds 
uncounted gigabytes of data) could be in Cupertino, or it might be in 
Timbuktu. There’s a whole bunch of ’em, too. You and I don’t need to care 
about the where part because
 
 Your iDisk is always available. Oh, yes. 24/7, your files are waiting for 
you.
 
 Your iDisk is secure. Apple goes to great lengths to guarantee the secu-
rity of your data, encrypting the transfer of files and folders whenever 
you use your iDisk. You can also password-protect any data that you 
want to offer to others, just in case.
 
 Your iDisk works even when you aren’t on the Internet. Yep, you 
read that right: You can create new documents and modify files to your 
heart’s content while you’re on a flight or relaxing on the beach. iDisk 
automatically updates whatever’s changed the next time you connect to 
the Internet.
Now that I’ve piqued your interest (and answered the most common question 
about iDisk), return to the .Mac service for a moment so I can show you how 
to set up your account.

139
 Chapter 9: .Mac Is .Made for Mac Laptops
Opening a .Mac Account
If you haven’t already opened your .Mac account, you get a chance to sign up 
when you turn on your laptop for the first time and also when you install (or 
upgrade to) Mac OS X. However, if you decided to pass on .Mac at that time, 
you can always join in the fun by following these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
 Read through Chapter 6 for the A–Z on System Preferences.
 
2. Click the .Mac icon.
 
3. Click the Learn More button.
 
 This launches Safari (the Apple browser) and displays the Apple .Mac 
Welcome page (www.mac.com/dotmac). Click Free Trial and then 
follow the onscreen instructions to choose a member name and pass-
word.
 
 When you’re done with the clicking and you’re rewarded with your login 
information, close Safari and then enter your name and password into 
the text boxes in the .Mac System Preferences pane.
Figure 9-2 illustrates an example login that I created.
 
Figure 9-2: 
The .Mac 
pane within 
System 
Preferences 
keeps track 
of your login 
information.
 
Like the convenient operating system that it is, Leopard handles all your 
.Mac login chores automatically from this point on.
 
If you’re a dialup Internet user, you were likely dreading this moment, but here 
it is. I’m truly sorry, but in my opinion, a high-speed broadband connection is 
a real requirement in order to take full advantage of a .Mac subscription. You 
can certainly still use all the functionality of .Mac with any type of Internet 
connection, but you’re going to spend from now until the next Gone With the 
Wind sequel waiting for files to copy and things to happen.

140
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
If you decide to sign up for a full year’s .Mac membership, I salute you for 
your discerning taste in online services. However, you can opt for a 60-day 
trial subscription at this point, which is only fair because Apple wants you 
to check out things at your leisure. Table 9-1 shows the major differences 
between a free trial subscription and a full $100 yearly subscription to .Mac.

A .Mac subscription also allows you to synchronize your e-mail, Address Book 
contact information, and your Safari bookmarks between multiple Macs. What 
a real boon if you spend time on the road with a member of the MacBook 
species!
 
Both trial and subscriber .Mac users can read .Mac e-mail through the Web-
based browser offered on the .Mac Web site. That’s neat, certainly, and you 
can use Web mail from any computer with an Internet connection. However, 
you can also send and receive .Mac e-mail seamlessly from Leopard’s Mail 
application, which is the preferred method of checking your messages. In fact, 
Leopard automatically creates a matching Mail account for your trial .Mac 
account. Unadulterated sweet!
Is .Mac an ISP?
.Mac is many things, but it isn’t an ISP (techno-
nerd shorthand for Internet service provider). 
You need to join an ISP first because you need 
an existing Internet connection to use the ser-
vices and features included in .Mac member-
ship. This makes a lot of sense, considering that 
most of us already have Internet access. (Plus, 
Apple doesn’t have to worry with all the sup-
port and hardware headaches that an ISP has 
to deal with.)
.Mac works with the ISP that you already 
have, so you don’t have to worry about AOL 
or EarthLink conflicting with .Mac. (However, I 
can’t guarantee that your system administrator 
at work will allow .Mac traffic across his or her 
pristine network. Perhaps a steak dinner would 
help your argument.)

141
 Chapter 9: .Mac Is .Made for Mac Laptops
If you decide that you want the extra functionality of a .Mac subscription, 
upgrading is easy. When you open the .Mac pane within System Preferences 
and click the Account button, Leopard displays a countdown reminder telling 
you how many days remain on your trial period. To upgrade, visit the .Mac 
Web site at any time and click the Join Now button.
Using Your iDisk on the iRoad
So how do you open your iDisk? Leopard gives you a number of different 
avenues:
 
 Choose Go➪iDisk from the Finder menu and then choose My iDisk 
from the submenu.
 
 Keyboard types can press Ô+Shift+I instead.
 
 Click the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.
 
 Click the iDisk button on your Finder toolbar.
 
 It’s easy to add an iDisk button. Open a Finder window, click View, and 
then click Customize Toolbar. Drag the iDisk icon up to the toolbar and 
then click Done.
After you open your iDisk, an iDisk volume icon also pops up on your 
Desktop. You can open the little scamp later in your computing session 
by simply double-clicking the Desktop icon. The Desktop iDisk icon hangs 
around until you log out, restart, eject the iDisk, or shut down your MacBook.
It’s all in the folders
Your iDisk contains a number of different folders. Some of them are similar to 
the subfolders in your Home folder, and others are unique to the structure of 
your iDisk. In this section, I provide the details on the iDisk folder family.
iDisk storage folders
Although you can store files and create folders in the root (or top level) of an 
iDisk, the same organizational tips apply as the root of your laptop’s internal 
hard drive. In other words, most things that you copy to or create on your 
iDisk should be stored in one of these six storage folders. (Refer to Figure 9-1 
to see them.)

142
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
 Documents: Store the documents that you create with your applications 
in this folder, which only you can access.
 
 Movies: This folder stores your QuickTime movies (including any that 
you might use in your .Mac Web pages).
 
 Music: iTunes music and playlists go here.
 
 Pictures: The digital images that you store in this folder can be used 
with other .Mac services (like your Web pages) or within iPhoto.
 
 Public: The files that you store in this folder are meant to be shared 
with other people (as well as offered on your .Mac Web pages). You can 
also allow others to copy and save files to your Public folder as well 
(more on this later in this section).
 
 Sites: You can use HomePage to create Web pages in this folder, or you 
can add Web pages that you’ve created with your own applications. You 
can read more about HomePage, the Apple Web page-creation applica-
tion, in the upcoming section, “Publishing a Web Site with HomePage.”
These folders can be opened in a Finder window just like any typical folder 
on your MacBook’s internal hard drive, and you can open and save docu-
ments to your iDisk folders, using all your applications. In other words, these 
six iDisk folders act just like normal, everyday folders. Pretty doggone neat!
Funky specialized iDisk folders
Your iDisk contains three folders that you can’t use to store stuff (directly, 
anyway):
 
 Backup: This is the storage vault for the backup files created with the 
.Mac Backup application. You can read more about Backup later in this 
chapter.
 
 Because you have Read access to the Backup folder, you can copy the 
backup files from this folder to a CD, DVD, or removable drive on your 
MacBook. (I cover backing up later in this chapter.)
 
 Library: Like the Library folders that you find in the root of your hard 
drive (and in your Home folder), this folder stores all sorts of configura-
tion settings for the .Mac features that you’re using, like your Backup 
settings.
 
 Software: This read-only folder is a special case. Apple stuffs this folder 
full of a wide variety of the latest in freeware and shareware as well as 
commercial demo software. You can copy whatever you like from the 
Software folder to your MacBook’s Desktop and then install your new 
toy from that local copy. (Oh, and the contents of the Software folder 
don’t count against your total storage space limit.) Enjoy!

143
 Chapter 9: .Mac Is .Made for Mac Laptops
Mirror, mirror, on your drive . . .
You can use your iDisk even if you aren’t connected to the Internet. This 
magic is accomplished through a mirror, or local copy of your iDisk, that’s 
stored on your local hard drive. (“Hey, wasn’t I supposed to be getting away 
from storing things locally?”) If you choose to use a mirror — and you can 
enable this feature if you like — Leopard automatically synchronizes any files 
that you created or changed on your local iDisk copy the next time you con-
nect to the Internet. This is a great feature if you have more than one Mac in 
different locations because you can update and synchronize your iDisk files 
from any of your computers — all automatically!
 
Without a mirror, you must have an active Internet connection to use your 
iDisk.
To enable (or disable) the mirror feature, open System Preferences, click the 
.Mac icon, and then click the iDisk tab to display the settings you see in Figure 
9-3. Click the Start button, and — after a moment of preparation, complete with 
its own dialog — the text above the button reads iDisk Syncing On.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Configure 
iDisk within 
System 
Preferences.
 
 
If you use a local copy of your iDisk — and I recommend it — choose to syn-
chronize automatically. This ensures that your files get updated even if you’re 
somewhat forgetful, like I am.

144
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
A mirror makes things much faster when you browse your iDisk or when you 
save and load documents from your iDisk. Leopard actually uses your local 
copy from your hard drive, and then updates your remote iDisk files in the 
background while you work. (Leopard is updating your iDisk whenever you 
see that animated circular-yin-yang-thinglet rotating next to your iDisk icon in 
the Finder window. You’ll know it when you see it.)
Monitoring and configuring your iDisk
The iDisk pane in System Preferences groups all the configuration settings 
that you can make to your iDisk and your .Mac account. In this section, I 
review the controls that you can find here.
Disk space
Concerned about how much of your 100MB (for trial users) or 10GB (for 
subscribers) remains? The iDisk panel (refer to Figure 9-3) includes the Disk 
Usage bar graph, which always displays how much of your iDisk space is free. 
(The bar actually totals only half of your storage because the other half of 
your iDisk is reserved for e-mail use.)
Public folder
The Finder Go menu includes a shortcut to access another .Mac member’s 
Public folder.
Password
I strongly recommend that you set a password to protect the contents of 
your Public folder.
This password must be entered by anyone trying to open your Public folder. 
If you haven’t supplied that person with the proper password, he can’t open 
your Public folder. Just that simple. (There’s nothing more embarrassing 
than discovering the bikini shots from your vacation are available for every 
.Mac user to peruse.)
 
Here’s one drawback to this extra level of security: If you password-protect 
your Public folder, it can’t be used to store anything that you offer on your 
.Mac Web pages.
Settings
While you’re in the iDisk panel, you can configure your Public folder security 
settings. You can decide whether others should be able to

145
 Chapter 9: .Mac Is .Made for Mac Laptops
 
 Only read the contents of your Public folder.
 
 By default, the Public folder is set to Read Only.
 
 Copy documents to your Public folder.
 
 To give others the ability to save and copy, select the Read and Write 
radio button.
Backing Up Your Treasured Laptop Stuff
My editors have heard me drone on and on long enough about how impor-
tant it is to back up your hard drive. They probably rub their eyes when they 
encounter yet another instance of my preaching about the wages of backup 
sloth and losing everything but hindsight.
Well, you’re lucky, because I was just about to launch into another round 
of backup warnings. .Mac subscribers get a great utility application called 
Backup when they join the club. Backup is a great application that saves a 
copy of your treasured data on just about any media on the planet, including
 
 Your iDisk (using the Backup folder that I discuss earlier in this chapter)
 
 An external USB or a FireWire hard drive
 
 Recordable CD or DVD media
 
 Network servers
 
 Your iPod
 
Before you get too enthusiastic about backing up to your iPod, heed this: You 
can indeed back up to your iPod (or I wouldn’t have listed it as an option), 
but your iPod’s tiny hard drive isn’t meant to handle the same serious thrash-
ing as a full-size external hard drive. Personally, I’ve never used my iPod as 
a backup destination, and I don’t recommend that you do, either, unless no 
other recording media is handy and you absolutely have to have a backup.
 
If you’d like an offline copy of your data that would survive a catastrophe like a 
fire or theft, consider using both Time Machine and Backup. That way, your stuff 
is covered in the WCS (short for worst case scenario). I cover Time Machine — 
Leopard’s awesome new automatic backup system — in Chapter 21.

146
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Installing Backup
Backup isn’t built into Leopard; you have to download it from the .Mac site at 
www.apple.com/dotmac. After the image file is mounted on your Desktop, 
you see the Backup installation folder. Double-click the Backup.pkg file to 
begin the installation. After installation is complete, you can find Backup in 
your Applications folder.
Saving your stuff
Nothing is more important to a proud MacBook owner than a secure backup. 
In this section, I demonstrate how you can produce both manual backups 
(produced whenever you like) and automated backups (which are scheduled 
at regular intervals). Do it!
 
Remember that you’re limited to 50MB of data storage with a trial .Mac mem-
bership! The other 50MB is dedicated to your .Mac e-mail account. (I’m still 
talking about several hundred JPEG images that can fit in 50MB, but that total 
isn’t much when you consider digital video or your iTunes Library.)
Beginning a backup is as easy as marking the check boxes next to the items 
that you want to safeguard. These are the default Backup Plans available, and 
they’re already scheduled to start automatically.
After you enable the check boxes for the items you want to back up, follow 
these steps to start a manual backup:
 
1. Click Continue to display the Backup main window.
 
 Notice that each backup plan you selected on the previous screen has a 
scheduled time assigned to it for automatic operation.
 
2. Click the plan you want to select it; then click Back Up.
The rest is cake as your irreplaceable stuff is saved to your iDisk.
If you ever need to restore from your backup, click the desired plan to select 
it, and then click the Restore button. Backup leads you through the restore 
process with the same aplomb.
The Backup application itself doesn’t need to be running for the automated 
backup to kick off, but keep in mind that your laptop must remain awake! 
Make sure that
 
 You’re logged in.
 
 Sleep mode is completely disabled on the Energy Saver pane within 
System Preferences.
 
 Your computer has an active Internet connection.

Publishing a Web Site with HomePage
HomePage is a very popular feature for .Mac members. Most MacBook 
owners aren’t Web page designers, after all, and HomePage is extremely easy 
to use. Apple is smart enough to let trial .Mac members use HomePage; you 
can try it before you decide to invest in a .Mac subscription.
Follow these steps to create a new Web page on your .Mac site with 
HomePage:
 
1. Launch Safari and visit www.apple.com/dotmac.
 
2. Click the Log In link.
 
 Safari prompts you for your .Mac member name and password.
 
3. Click the HomePage link at the top of the .Mac Welcome page.
 
 The HomePage top-level page that you see in Figure 9-4 appears.
 
Figure 9-4:

4. Choose a theme for your page from the tabbed display at the left of 
the screen.
 
 Some of the categories are specially designed for certain chores. For 
example, the Photo Album theme collection is perfect for showing off 
your digital photographs online, and the File Sharing category presents 
an easy downloading format for your visitors. Each of these different cat-
egories displays different onscreen instructions that are specific to their 
use.
 
 For an elegant site where you show off your best photography online, 
click the Formal frame in the Photo Album category.
 
5. Choose the folder with the photos you want to include on the page.
 
 This can be either your iDisk Pictures folder or a subfolder that you cre-
ated within it.
 
6. Click Choose.
 
 HomePage loads all the images in the selected folder.
 
7. Mark the Show check box for each image that you want to appear.
 
8. Drag the image thumbnails to the order that you want.
 
9. Select the text boxes to add
 
• The Web page title
 
• An introductory sentence (or two)
 
• The titles for each photo
 
 You can display a counter (which tallies how many visitors came to your 
page) and an e-mail button (so your visitors can send a message to your 
.Mac e-mail account). To use either of these features, just mark the cor-
responding Show check box to enable it.
 
10. Click Preview in the toolbar at the top of the page to see what your 
page will look like.
 
 If the page you see in Preview mode isn’t up to snuff, click the Back 
button on the Safari Toolbar to edit it.
 
11. If you like what you see, click the Publish button.
 
 Huzzah! You’re a Web page designer! (Insert sound of champagne cork 
popping here.)
 
 HomePage displays your new Web page address, which you can click to 
jump directly to your new work of art.
 
The steps to create a page vary by category. However, the only category that 
really requires any rocket science is the Advanced tab, which allows you 
to use your own HTML files that you copy to your iDisk Sites folder. Not to 
worry, though: Just follow the onscreen instructions for creating a Web site 
with your own HTML files, and you’ll be fine.

T
his chapter is all about getting interesting things into — and out of — 
your MacBook. Some are more common (almost mundane these days) 
and pretty easy to take care of, such as scanners and printers. Then I might 
surprise you with something new to you, like your laptop’s built-in video 
camera, which is built into your laptop and the perfect companion to Photo 
Booth.
I also show you how to turn your road warrior into a photo booth, and how 
to use an Apple Remote to control your MacBook or MacBook Pro wirelessly 
using Leopard’s Front Row application. Heck, I’ll even describe how you can 
pull that fancy satellite or cable TV signal into your laptop.
Sure, you can connect your MacBook Pro to a printer and do some serious 
work — but then again, you could also snap your photo and send it to your 
friends as an e-mail attachment or upload it to your blog. Decisions, decisions!
Connecting Printers
All hail the USB port! It’s the primary connection point for all sorts of good-
ies. In this section, I concentrate on adding a local USB printer and the basics 
of adding a network printer to your system. (You find more on connecting a 
wireless Bluetooth printer in Chapter 18.)

150
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
USB printers
Connecting a USB printer to your MacBook is duck soup. Don’t you wish all 
things in life were this easy? You might very well be able to skip most of the 
steps in this section entirely, depending on whether your printer came with 
an installation disc. (Virtually all do, of course, but you might have bought 
yours used, say from eBay.)
 
Your printer needs to be fully supported within Mac OS X:
 
 If the software is designed for earlier versions of Mac OS X (say, v. 10.3 
or v. 10.4), it probably works with Leopard.
 
 I always recommend visiting the manufacturer’s Web site to download 
the latest printer driver and support software before you install your 
printer. That way, you know that you’re up to date. (Don’t forget to 
check the Read Me file that accompanies your new software to make 
sure there are no new system requirements!)
 
Save and close open files and applications before installing your printer. You 
might have to restart your laptop to complete the installation.
The physical connections for your printer are pretty simple:
 
1. Make sure that your printer’s USB cable is plugged in to both your 
laptop and the printer itself.
 
2. After the USB connection is made, plug the printer in to an AC wall 
socket and turn it on.
 
Don’t forget to add the paper and check the cartridge(s)!
The finishing printer installation steps depend on whether you have a manu-
facturer’s installation CD for your printer.
Sure, I’ve got the install disc
If your printer comes with its manufacturer’s installation disc, follow these 
steps when everything is connected and powered on:
 
1. Insert the installation disc in the laptop.
 
 
The disc contents usually appear in a Finder window. If they don’t, dou-
ble-click the installation disc icon on the Desktop to open the window.
 
 
If you’re using a MacBook Air, you need to use either the external 
SuperDrive or a computer with an optical drive on your local network.

151
 Chapter 10: Spiffy Connections for the Road Warrior
 
2. Double-click the installation application to start the ball rolling.
 
3. Follow the onscreen instructions.
 
 
Files get copied to your hard drive.
 
 
You might have to restart your MacBook.
You’re ready to print!
 
Don’t forget to visit your printer manufacturer’s Web site to check whether 
any driver updates are available for your particular model.
Whoops, I’ve got diddly-squat (Software-wise)
Didn’t get an installation CD? Try installing the printer without software, or 
download the software from the manufacturer’s Web site.
Installing without software
If you didn’t get an installation CD with your printer, you might be lucky 
enough that your printer’s driver was included in your installation of Mac OS 
X. First, press Ô+P within an application to display the Print dialog, and see 
whether the printer you connected is already recognized.
If it’s not displayed, here’s how to check for that pesky driver after you con-
nect the printer and switch it on:
 
1. Open the System Preferences window.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which sports a plus sign).
 
4. Check the Printer list in the Printer Setup Utility window to see 
whether your printer has already been added automatically within 
Leopard.
 
 If your printer appears here, dance a celebratory jig. You can close 
System Preferences and choose that printer from the Print dialog in your 
applications. You can set it as the default from the System Preferences 
Print & Fax pane; just click the Default Printer pop-up menu to select 
your new printer.
Downloading software
If you don’t have installation software and your laptop doesn’t automatically 
match your USB printer with a driver, it’s time to check the Internet to locate 
a Leopard-compatible driver for your printer.

152
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Check the manufacturer’s Web site for your printer’s software. Look for
 
 Special software drivers that the printer might need
 
 Install any drivers you find before you run an installation application. 
Otherwise, the installation app might not be able to recognize or config-
ure the printer if the driver hasn’t been installed first.
 
 Installation application
 
 If the manufacturer offers an installation application for your printer, 
download the application and run it.
Networked printers
Your wired or wireless Ethernet network provides a quick and easy way to 
share any printer that’s connected to your MacBook. Follow these steps to 
share your printers across the network with others:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
 
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
In most cases, a printer that you share automatically appears in the Print 
dialog on other computers connected to your network. Therefore, if you want 
to access a printer being shared by another Mac across your network, open 
the Print dialog within your application and click the Printer pop-up menu to 
select it.
If the remote printer isn’t listed automatically, you can dig a little further. 
To add a printer that another Mac on your network is sharing to your list of 
printers, follow these steps:
 
1. Click System Preferences on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
 
4. Click the Default button on the toolbar.
 
 Leopard displays all the available local shared printers. Click the desired 
printer and then click Add.

Connecting Scanners
USB and FireWire scanners practically install themselves. As long as the 
model is listed as Mac OS X-compatible (check the system requirements on 
the scanner’s box or on the manufacturer’s Web site for compatible comput-
ers) and it supports the TWAIN device standard (just about all scanners do), 
things really are plug-and-play.
 
The MacBook Air doesn’t have a FireWire port, so it’s a USB-only ticket.
If you have the scanner manufacturer’s installation disc, go ahead and use 
it. However, most scanners don’t require specialized drivers, so even that 
orphan model that you picked up from Uncle Milton last year should work 
(if it’s recognized by Mac OS X). It doesn’t hurt to check the manufacturer’s 
Web site to see whether any of the software has been updated since the disc 
was produced.
 
If Mac OS X doesn’t support your older scanner, a third-party application 
might be able to help. Get thee hence to Hamrick Software at www.hamrick.
com and download a copy of the latest version of VueScan. This great scan-
ning application supports over 750 scanner models, including a number that 
don’t work with Leopard otherwise. At $40, it’s a world-class bargain to boot.
Ready to go? Make sure that your scanner is powered on and connected to 
your laptop (and that you load a page or photograph to scan). If your scan-
ner’s installation disc provided you with a proprietary scanning application, 
I recommend that you use that application to test your scanner. In fact, it’s 
Mark’s Maxim time!
 
If your printer or scanner includes bundled applications, use them! ™
Sure, Mac OS X has the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences for print-
ers and the Image Capture application for scanners and digital cameras, 
but these are bare-bones tools compared with the print manager and image 
acquisition software that comes bundled with your hardware. I turn to 
Leopard’s built-in hardware handling stuff only when I don’t have anything 
better.
Hey, I’m not saying that anything’s wrong with Image Capture, which is in 
your Applications folder, if you need to use it. However, don’t expect Image 
Capture to support any specialized features offered by your scanner (like 
one-button e-mail or Web publishing). You have to use the application espe-
cially designed for your manufacturer and model to take advantage of any 
extras that it offers.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Using Photo Booth and Front Row
Many Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice that tiny square 
lens and LED light at the top of the MacBook’s svelte frame. You might also 
have received a device that looks like a stick of chewing gum with buttons. 
What gives?
First, allow me to identify these toys. The former is the lens of your laptop’s 
built-in iSight camera, which allows you to capture video or snap a quick fun 
series of photos via Leopard’s Photo Booth application. The latter is an Apple 
Remote, which you can use to control your MacBook from the comfort of 
your lounge chair or breakfast nook via Leopard’s Front Row software.
If your MacBook didn’t come with an Apple Remote, you can pick one up on 
Apple’s Web site. Note, however, that the MacBook Air is not compatible with 
the Apple Remote because the Air model doesn’t have an infrared sensor.
Capturing the moment with Photo Booth
What’s that you say? You’ve never used a computer video camera? Well then, 
good reader, you’ve come to the right place!
The iSight camera’s indicator light (see Figure 10-1) glows green whenever 
you’re taking a snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, 
is A Good Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).

If you need a quick picture of yourself for use on your Web page, or perhaps 
your iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut, use Photo 
Booth to capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color. Although 
today’s digital cameras can produce a much higher-quality photo, you can’t 
beat the built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot!
To snap an image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photo Booth from the Dock or from the Applications folder.
 
 Check out that glowing LED!
 
2. (Optional) Click Effects button to choose an effect that you’d like to 
apply to your image.
 
 Photo Booth displays four screens of thumbnail preview images. Each 
screen displays nine thumbnails (see Figure 10-2) so that you can see 
how each effect changes the photo. To move through the thumbnail 
screens, click the Previous and Next arrow buttons that appear around 
the Effects button.

 You can produce some of the simple effects you might be familiar with 
from Photoshop (such as a black-and-white image or a fancy, colored 
pencil filter), but it can also deliver some mind-blowing distortion 
effects, and even an Andy Warhol–style pop-art image!
 
 Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward 
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available in 
iPhoto — but Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon 
as you take the picture.
 
3. (Optional) Click a thumbnail to select the desired effect.
 
 To return the display to normal, click the Normal thumbnail, which 
appears in the center. (Um, that would be Paul Lynde’s spot, for those of 
you old enough to remember Hollywood Squares.)
 
4. Click the Camera button.
 
 The image appears in the film strip at the bottom of the window.
Photo Booth keeps a copy of all the images you take in the film strip so that 
you can use them later. After you click a photo in the film strip, a series of 
buttons appear, inviting you take any one of a series of actions, including
 
 Sending the photo in an e-mail message
 
 Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
 
 Using the image as your Leopard user account icon
 
 Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
 
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo 
and then click the X button that appears underneath.
If you’re itching to connect a USB digital camera for use with iPhoto, let me 
redirect you to Chapter 12, where I cover the iPhoto experience in depth.
To capture a video clip, click the Movie Clip button (which bears frames from 
an old-fashioned movie reel) at the lower left of the Photo Booth window. 
Click the Big Red Movie Button to start recording, and again to end the clip.
Controlling your laptop 
remotely with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now! 
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your MacBook into a multime-
dia presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your ador-
ing public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, with the Apple Remote, 
you don’t even have to leave the comfort of the couch to start the show.

157
 Chapter 10: Spiffy Connections for the Road Warrior
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
 
 Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD 
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your MacBook doesn’t 
load the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually 
driven for a few years yet.) Naturally, MacBook Air owners need an 
external SuperDrive to watch movies from a disc.
 
 Viewing photos and slide shows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that 
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slideshows.
 
 Displaying videos in QuickTime Player: You can choose any video you 
download from the iTunes Music Store or save to your Movies folder.
 
 Coaxing your favorite music, podcasts, and TV shows from your 
iTunes library: Find your media and playlists available from Front Row.
All this is accomplished by using the awesome, infrared Apple Remote you 
see in Figure 10-3. If your last computer — the beige box — didn’t have a 
remote control, don’t panic. It’s as simple to use as an iPod Shuffle!

menu in Front Row, offering you the chance to toggle your screen saver and 
menu sound effects off or on. Both options are turned on by default.)
 
Your Apple Remote isn’t designed to work with any other third-party applica-
tions at the time of this writing. For example, you can’t use it as a presentation 
aid in PowerPoint. However, some Apple applications do recognize the Apple 
Remote (like Keynote), and it’s a sure bet that Apple will continue to add func-
tionality to the Apple Remote in the future. Check the Apple Remote section of 
Leopard’s online Help system to keep tabs on what’s happening!

Using iSight with iChat AV
Although your MacBook comes ready for videoconferencing, you should 
understand two caveats before embarking on the Voyage of Video Chat:
 
 Speed is an issue. To take advantage of video in iChat AV, you need a 
fast Internet connection — at least high-speed DSL or cable Internet, or 
even a connection between computers on the same network.
 
 All participants need a video camera. Plenty of folks online have sud-
denly realized that most of their iChat AV buddies didn’t have video 
capability!
Even though your laptop has an iSight camera installed, you can still join 
text-based and audio chats. (Your Mac has a built-in microphone, so even if 
your online buddies aren’t equipped with video hardware, you can enjoy an 
audio chat.) iChat AV displays audio and video buttons next to each person 
on your buddy list to help you keep track of who can communicate with you 
and how they can do it.
Starting a video chat is as simple as launching iChat AV from the Dock (or 
from your Application folder). Then in the buddy list, click any buddy entry 
with a Camera button next to it to connect. Wave hello for me!
Turning Your MacBook into a 
TV — And More
Your laptop’s beautiful LCD screen would seem to be the perfect artist’s 
canvas for watching live cable or satellite TV broadcasts, but there’s no coax-
ial (coax) input on the back of your computer. Therefore, unless you invest in 
some additional hardware, you’re restricted to watching DVD movies (using 
your optical drive) or watching movies and TV shows that you downloaded 
from the iTunes Store.
Such an obvious need is going to be filled quickly, and a number of different 
hardware manufacturers have produced external devices that can merge 
your MacBook and your TV signal. Most are USB or FireWire peripherals, and 
many have all the features of today’s TiVo and digital video recorders.
My favorite example is the EyeTV Hybrid, from Elgato Systems (www.
elgato.com), which uses a USB connection (so it’s suitable for use with the 
MacBook Air). Check out what this superstar includes for your investment of 
$150.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
 Built-in NTSC (analog) and ATSC (digital TV) tuners, cable-ready with a

stored on your laptop’s hard drive
 
 Capability to schedule recordings with an onscreen program guide
 
 Full-screen TV display or in a window anywhere on your Desktop
 
 No external power supply required
I really love the ability to fast-forward through commercials, and I can take 
anything that I record on my MacBook Pro and use it in iDVD and iMovie. The 
addition of TV under your control sorta finalizes the whole digital hub thing, 
now doesn’t it?

S
ometimes, words just aren’t enough. iTunes is that kind of 
perfection.
To envision how iTunes changes your relationship with your MacBook, you 
have to paint the picture with music — music that’s easy to play, easy to 
search, and easy to transfer from place to place. Whether it be classical, 
alternative, jazz, rock, hip-hop, or folk, I can guarantee you that you won’t 
find a better application than iTunes to fill your life with your music.
Whoops, I almost forgot: and podcasts. And video. And TV shows. And 
Internet radio. (See how hard it is to pin down this wonderful application? 
Along with your laptop, iTunes really does form the hub of your digital 
lifestyle.)
In this chapter, I lead you through all the features of my absolute favorite 
member of the iLife ’08 suite . . . and it’s going to be pretty doggone obvious 
how much I appreciate this one piece of software.
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player: It plays both audio and video files, 
which can come in many different formats. Some of the more common audio 
formats that iTunes supports are

164
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading 
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size 
(albeit at the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-
minute pop song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
 
 AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s 
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at 
the same file sizes. However, this format also supports a built-in, copy-
protection scheme that prevents AAC music from being widely distrib-
uted on Macs. (Luckily, you can still burn AAC tracks to an audio CD, 
just like MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download from the iTunes 
Store are in AAC format.
 
 The iTunes Store’s iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC format, but these 
tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a higher-quality 
256 Kbps rate. You can listen to your iTunes Plus tracks on as many 
Macs as you like.
 
 Apple Lossless: Another format directly from Apple, Apple Lossless 
format provides the best compromise between file size and sound qual-
ity. These tracks are encoded without loss of quality: hence the name, as 
opposed to “lossy” compression schemes, such as MP3. However, Apple 
Lossless tracks, which are somewhat larger than AAC files, are generally 
considered the favorite of the most discerning audiophile for their entire 
music library.
 
 AIFF: This standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the 
absolute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the 
files are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a 
size of 30–50MB.
 
 WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format 
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, like AIFF.
 
 CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store 
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
 
 Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV 
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store. And, 
with an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can 
watch those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the 
other side of your house.
 
 Podcasts: These relatively new programs are like radio programs for 
your iPod, but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts 
also include video and photos, to boot.
 
 Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy 
your spoken books. iTunes can play audiobooks for you, or you can 
send them to your iPod for listening on the go.

165
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
 Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of 
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with qual-
ity levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full qual-
ity of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still great 
fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in the 
chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your laptop’s opti-
cal drive, start iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock, and then click the Play 
button. (Note that your MacBook might be set to automatically launch iTunes 
when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles that of a tradi-
tional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the iTunes display 
are Previous, Play, Next, and the volume slider, as shown in Figure 11-1.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the 
Play button toggles to a Pause button. As you might imagine, clicking that 
button again pauses the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with 
your trackpad, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the 
Play and Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again 
to stop.
Click the Next button to advance to the next song on the CD. The Previous 
button works like the Next button but with a slight twist: If a song is playing 
and you click the Previous button, iTunes first returns to the beginning of the 
current song (just like an audio CD player). To advance to the previous song, 
double-click the Previous button. To change the volume of your music, click 
and drag the volume slider.
Like other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with the 
keyboard. Table 11-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard short-
cuts. (Note that iTunes must be the active application for these shortcuts to 
work.)

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can also play the digital audio files 
that you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the 
WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. (You can read about 
these formats earlier in this chapter.)
Enjoying a digital audio file is just slightly more complicated than playing a 
CD. After downloading or saving your audio files to your laptop, open the 
Finder and navigate to wherever you stored the files. Then simply drag the 

167
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
music files (or an entire folder of music) from the Finder onto the Music entry 
in the iTunes Source list, on the left side of the iTunes window.
The added files appear in the iTunes Music Library. Think of the Music 
Library as a master list of your music. To view the Music Library, select the 
Music entry in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, as shown in Figure 
11-2. Go figure.
Heck, you can also drag a song file from a Finder window and drop it on the 
iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to your Music Library as well.
 
If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it 
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists in 
a bit.)
To play a song, just double-click it in the Music Library list. Alternatively, you 
can click the song once to select it and use the playback controls (Previous, 
Play, and Next) that I discuss earlier in this chapter. (Refer to Figure 11-1.)
 
The Source list of iTunes can list up to six possible sources for audio.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The Music 
Library 
keeps track 
of all your 
audio files.
 

168
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, 
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I dis-
cuss further in the section, “iTunes Radio.”) Discerning readers will note 
that Figure 11-2 doesn’t show Audiobooks: That’s because I don’t have 
any loaded.
 
 iPod: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia, 
other models of MP3 players from other companies also appear in the 
list if they support iTunes.)
 
 iTunes Store: I discuss this later in the section, “Buying Billie Holiday 
from the Apple Music Store.”
 
 Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall 
Out Boy.
 
 Shared music: If another Mac on your local network is running iTunes 
and is set to share part (or all) of its library, you can connect to the 
other computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears 
as a separate named folder in the Source list.) Of course, you can elect 
to share your music with others as well.
 
 Playlists: Think of playlists as folders that you use to organize your 
music. (More on playlists later in this chapter.)
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to it, 
such as
 
 Name: The title of the song
 
 Time: The length of the song
 
 Artist: Who performs the song
 
 Album: The album on which the song appears
Most MP3 files have embedded data — title, album, or artist information, 
for example — that iTunes can read, but don’t panic if those fields are blank 
or generic right now. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always add 
the information to these fields manually. I show you how later in the section, 
“Setting or changing the song information manually.”
 
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder 
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Name column 
heading alphabetizes your Library by song title (and another click reverses the 
order). Oh, and you can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like.
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view that you see in Figure 11-1, where each song is one 
entry. Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to 
group tracks together by album. Click the third View button (Cover Flow), 
and you’re browsing by album cover, complete with reflective surface!

169
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
In fact, you can even browse full-screen in Cover Flow mode. Click the Full-
Screen button at the lower right of the cover pane — it looks like a box with 
arrows at each corner — and iTunes switches to full-screen mode, complete 
with those familiar play controls.
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become a 
task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cumber-
some as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help out, 
iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, browsing 
mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the Browse button at the 
lower-right corner of the iTunes window, which carries an eye icon.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion, orga-
nizing your tunes into four sections:
 
 Genre
 
 Artist
 
 Album
 
 Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s 
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes 
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window. 
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.) Note 
that the Browse button is disabled in Cover Flow view mode.
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes watches 
your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you try to delete a song 
from the Library that’s located only in the iTunes 
Music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes 
from another location on your hard drive). That 
means you’re about to delete the song entirely, 
with no copy remaining on your MacBook. Rest 
assured, though, that iTunes will prompt you to 
make sure that you really want to move the file to 
the Trash. (I get fearful e-mail messages all the 
time from readers who are loath to delete any-
thing from iTunes because they’re afraid they’ll 
trash their digital music files completely.)
If you delete a song from the Library that exists 
elsewhere on your hard drive (outside the reach 
of the iTunes Music folder), it isn’t deleted 
from your hard drive. In fact, if you mistakenly 
remove a song that you meant to keep, just drag 
it back into iTunes from the Finder, or even from 
the Trash. ’Nuff said.

170
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out, 
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the 
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find a 
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in the 
results.
For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might return results 
for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classified as electronic 
in the Genre field. (The upcoming section, “Know Your Songs,” tells you how 
to classify your songs by genre, among other options.) Click the magnifying 
glass at the left side of the Search field to restrict the search even more: by 
Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that 
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your 
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie 
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it 
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard. (If that sounds a bit daunt-
ing, check out the sidebar titled, “Will I trash my Count Basie?”)
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to your music. To view your 
video collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
 
 Movies
 
 Music Videos
 
 Video Podcasts
 
 TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumbnails. 
Music Videos appear as a standard playlist.

171
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
From your collection, you can
 
 Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
 
 Drag any QuickTime-compatible video clip from the Finder window to 
the iTunes window.
 
 These typically include video files ending in .mov or .mp4.
iTunes plays video full-screen, but when you move your finger across your 
trackpad, a control strip appears, sporting a standard slider bar that you 
can drag to move through the video (as well as a volume control and Fast 
Forward/Reverse buttons). You can also pause the video by clicking the 
Pause button.
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady 
Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Given time, your iTunes Music Library can quickly become a fearsomely 
huge beastie. Each Library can contain thousands upon thousands of songs: 
If your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your 
lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task. Furthermore, with 
the Library, if you just click Play you’re stuck listening to songs in the order 
that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature. 
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You 
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any 
numbers of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist 
displays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes — deleting a 
song, for example — that you make to a playlist affect only that playlist, leav-
ing the Library intact.
For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-loving 
friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song to change the 
music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and start the playlist at 
the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about changing the 
music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the accordion.)
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
 
 Choose File➪New Playlist.
 
 Press Ô+N.

172
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist 
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected in the 
Library. iTunes also attempts to name the playlist automatically for you.
 
 Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign 
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist 
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s 
a good idea to . . . well . . . name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have 
this book?) To load a playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the 
songs for that playlist. Click the playlist entry in the source list again to type 
a new name for the playlist.
To add a song from the library to your new playlist, click the Library and find 
the song you want to include, and then drag it to the desired playlist entry in 
the Source list.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a 
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs 
themselves. Add and remove them at will to any playlist, secure in the knowl-
edge that the songs remain safe in the Library. As for removing playlists 
themselves, that’s simple, too. Just select the playlist in the Source list and 
then press Delete.
 
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.
Some playlists are smarter than others
From the File menu, take a look at a menu com-
mand for creating a smart playlist. The contents 
of a smart playlist are automatically created 
from a specific condition or set of conditions 
that you specify via the Smart Playlist dialog: 
You can limit the track selection by mundane 
things, such as album, genre, or artist; or, you 
can get funky and specify songs that were 
played last, or by the date you added tracks, or 
even by the sampling rate or total length of the 
song. For example, iTunes can create a playlist 
packed with songs that are shorter than three 
minutes, so you can fill your iPod Shuffle with 
more stuff! Ah, but wait! You’re not limited to a 
single criterion. If you want to add other crite-
rion, click the plus sign at the right side of the 
dialog, and you get another condition field to 
refine your selection even further.
You can choose the maximum number of songs 
to add to the smart playlist; or limit the size of 
the playlist by the minutes or hours of play, or 
the number of megabytes or gigabytes the play-
list will occupy. (Again, great for automatically 
gathering as much from your KISS collection 
that will fit into a specific amount of space on a 
CD or your iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check 
box for the ultimate in convenience. iTunes 
automatically maintains the contents of the 
smart playlist to keep it current with your con-
ditions at all times in the future. (If you remove 
tracks manually from a smart playlist, iTunes 
adds other tracks that match your conditions.)

173
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
Click the Party Shuffle playlist, and you encounter a random selection of songs 
taken from your iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next party! You can 
change the order of the songs in the Party Shuffle playlist, add songs from 
your Library, or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of your 
gathering. Enjoy!
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives 
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add 
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it. 
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
 
 Name: The name of the song
 
 Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
 
 Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the 
song
 
 Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or 
tribute album
 
 Album: The album where the song appears
 
 Grouping: A group type that you assign
 
 Year: The year when the artist recorded the song
 
 BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
 
 Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
 
 Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
 
 Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
 
 Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing Ô+I 
to make the fields appear on the Info tab. Alternatively, you can choose 
File➪Get Info.
Setting the song information 
automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song informa-
tion included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD, iTunes 
connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the information for 
each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it often comes 

174
Part IV: Living the iLife 
with some information embedded in the file already; the amount of included 
information depends on what the creator supplied. (And believe me, it’s often 
misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you don’t have an Internet 
connection, iTunes can’t access the information and displays generic titles 
instead.
 
Internet connection restored? You can download the information on a CD at 
any time by choosing Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.
Setting or changing the song 
information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an 
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name! To 
view and change the information for a song, perform the following steps:
 
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
 
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
Figure 11-3:

175
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of 
the songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. 
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in 
a hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song. 
(It just makes life easier later if you do.) Normally, you can get away with set-
ting only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, 
however, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange. 
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but 
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but 
the Data Elves are out to lunch.)
“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes dis-
plays the artwork in a number of different places (including Album view and 
Cover Flow view), and the application can try to locate artwork automatically 
for the tracks you select. (Note that adding large images can significantly 
increase the size of the song file.) Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
 
2. Choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.
 
You can set iTunes to automatically attempt the addition of album artwork 
every time you rip tracks from an audio CD, or when you add songs without 
artwork to your Music Library. Click iTunes and choose Preferences. Click the 
General button and then select the Automatically Download Missing Album 
Artwork check box to enable it.
 
Unfortunately, the Get Album Artwork feature often doesn’t pull in any art-
work for little-known artists. Luckily, you can always add album covers to your 
song info manually! Select one (or all) of the songs from a single album in the 
track list, display the Info dialog, and click the Artwork tab. Now launch Safari, 
visit Amazon.com, and do a search on the same album. Drag the cover image 
from the Web page right into the Info dialog and then drop it on top of the 
image well. When you click OK, the image appears in the Summary pane, and 
you can display it while your music is playing by pressing Ô+G, or by pressing 
the Show or Hide Song Artwork button at the lower left of the iTunes window! 
(Again, adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.)
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can 
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your 
audio CDs with iTunes. (If you have a MacBook Air, you need the external 
SuperDrive to read audio CDs. Go figure.) The process of converting audio 
files to different formats is ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call 
this process digital extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the 
popular crowd.)

176
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Depending on what hardware or software you use, you’re likely to encounter 
differences in formats. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or AAC 
files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert files from 
one format to another is like having a personal translator in the digital world. 
You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can simply con-
vert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping involves converting CD audio to MP3 
format. To rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock.
 
 Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
 
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
 
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the Advanced toolbar 
button.
 
4. Click the Importing tab.
 
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
 
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and 
then click OK.
 
 This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality 
(better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size. (Tracks that 
you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates, such as 
192 Kbps or higher.)
 
7. Load an audio CD into your MacBook.
 
 The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list, which is on the left side 
of the iTunes interface. The CD track listing appears on the right side of 
the interface.
 
 If iTunes asks you whether you want to import the contents of the CD 
into your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps. 
However, if you disabled this prompt, just continue with the remaining 
two steps.
 
8. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from 
the CD.
 
 All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default. 
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
 
 Notice that the Browse button changes to Import CD.
 
9. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click 
the Import CD button.

 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter, 
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of 
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower 
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize how your 
music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer, do one of the following.
 
 Choose Window➪Equalizer.
 
 Press Ô+Option+2.
 
 Choose View➪Show Equalizer.
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use the leftmost 
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting 
a slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to 
play back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that 
frequency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the 
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the sliders until your music sounds how you like it. When 
you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your settings until you 
change them again. If you prefer to leave frequencies to the experts, the 
iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most musical 
styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer window to select a 
genre.
A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in 
Internet radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a large 
number of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recognized 
by iTunes, or even add your favorite stations to your Playlists. This section 
shows you how to do it all.

178
Part IV: Living the iLife 
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate 
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet — a 
process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “In” Internet crowd. iTunes 
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with 
only a few clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located 
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than 20 
types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a 
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations 
for that category. Whether you like Elvis (or those passing fads, like new 
wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The Radio 
also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you want to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action, loads 
the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web, 
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio 
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes 
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that 
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
What’s with the numbers next to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep 
your Internet connection speed in mind. If 
you’re using a broadband DSL or cable connec-
tion — or if you’re listening at work over your 
company’s high-speed network — you can 
listen to stations broadcasting at 128 Kbps (or 
even higher). The higher the bit rate, the better 
the music sounds. At 128 Kbps, for example, 
you’re listening to sound that’s as good as an 
audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dialup 
modem connection, iTunes can’t keep up with 
audio streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re 
limited to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or 
lower.

179
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Stream (or press Ô+U). In the Open 
Stream dialog that appears, enter the URL of your desired radio station and 
then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes in your station, and the station 
name is added as an entry in your Library.
Radio stations in your Playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be 
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its Playlists. To add a 
radio station to a Playlist, do the following:
 
1. Open the category that contains the station that you want to add to 
your Playlist.
 
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your Playlist and drag it 
from the Radio list to the desired Playlist on the left.
 
 If you haven’t created any Playlists yet, see the section, “Keeping Slim 
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists,” earlier in this 
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier but 
possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio station 
URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced menu, it 
doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the Playlist. Follow these steps to 
add a specific radio station to a Playlist:
 
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired Playlist.
 
 Any station in the list will do because you’ll immediately change both 
the station’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the 
Playlist.
I have an itch to hear “Kung Fu Fighting!”
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio, 
the Internet radio station I’ve been running for 
several years now. I call my station a ’70s Time 
Machine because it includes hundreds of clas-
sic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You hear 
everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo” 
by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels Right” by 
Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a decade here, 
so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain 
and Tennille, too.) The station broadcasts at 
128 Kbps (audio CD quality), so you need a 
broadband connection to listen. For the radio’s 
Internet address or help connecting to MLC 
Radio, visit my Web site at www.mlcbooks.
om — then follow the steps in the next section 
to add MLC Radio to your playlists!

for that station.
 
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit 
URL button.
 
4. Enter the desired URL and then click OK.
 
5. Click the Info tab, type the new station name, and then click OK.
Burning Like a True Techno
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too. 
iTunes makes recording songs to a CD as simple as a few clicks — now, put-
ting together the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is easier 
than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of three 
formats:
 
 Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy 
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which 
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
 
 Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the 
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player 
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can 
listen to these songs only by using your MacBook and an audio player, 
like iTunes or a PC running Windows.
Yes, Virginia, you can broadcast your music
If your MacBook has built-in AirPort Extreme 
wireless hardware (all recent models do) and 
you’re using an AirPort Express portable wire-
less Base Station, you can ship your songs right 
to your Base Station from within iTunes — and 
from there to your home stereo or boom box! 
(I get into some serious discussion of AirPort 
Express in Chapter 17.)
After your AirPort Express Base Station is 
plugged in and you connect your home stereo 
(or a boom box, or a pair of powered stereo 
speakers) to the stereo mini-jack on the Base 
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button 
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. (If 
the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose 
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences 
dialog and click the Advanced tab. Make sure 
that the Look for Remote Speakers Connected 
with AirTunes check box is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose 
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes 
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology 
truly grand?

181
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
 MP3 CD: Like the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an MP3 CD 
holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged in such 
a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that support the 
MP3 CD format (especially boom boxes, personal CD players, and car 
stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller than the digital audio 
tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit as many as 160 typical, 
four-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also be played on your 
laptop via iTunes.
 
MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that you buy at the store, 
and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that don’t support the MP3 
CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc that you burn at home for 
your own collection.
First things first: Before you burn, you need to set the recording format. Open 
the iTunes Preferences dialog by choosing iTunes➪Preferences. Click the 
Advanced button, click the Burning tab, and select the desired disc format by 
enabling the corresponding radio button. Click OK to close the Preferences 
window when you’re finished.
The next step in the CD creation process is to build a playlist (or select an 
existing playlist that you want to record). If necessary, create a new playlist 
and add to it whatever songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the ear-
lier section, “Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with 
Playlists,” if you need a refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select 
the playlist. Click the Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window to 
commence the disc burning process. iTunes lets you know when the record-
ing is complete.
Backing up within iTunes
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your 
media library. (I told you this was the best media 
player ever designed!) Choose File➪Back Up 
to Disc to start the process. You can choose 
to back up your entire iTunes library and all 
your playlists (which I recommend) or just the 
content you purchased from the iTunes Store. 
Personally, if I lost everything in my collection 
except for what I’ve bought from the iTunes 
Store, I’d be just as crushed. Back it all up, and 
you won’t be sorry.
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for 
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from 
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and 
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes 
to backing up your content? That depends 
completely on how often your media library 
changes. The idea is to back up often enough 
so that you always have a recent copy of your 
media files close by.

Visualization: Music for your eyes
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that 
it can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can 
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music.
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Turn On Visualizer (or press 
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins dis-
playing groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the visu-
als, choose View➪Turn Off Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual sunny 
aluminum face of iTunes returns.
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu. 
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape from 
the Full Screen mode, click the trackpad button or press Esc.
 
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming 
around your screen. See Table 11-1, earlier in this chapter, for a rundown on 
common keyboard shortcuts.
Buying Billie Holiday from the Apple 
Music Store
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t 
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and video: 
the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of iTunes. 
(That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s time to 
turn the page to a different chapter.)
Figure 11-4 illustrates the lobby of this online audio/video store. Click 
the iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments, you’re 
presented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the Store list to browse 
according to media type; or, click the Power Search link to search by song 
title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of the 
iTunes Store window operate much like those in Safari, moving you backward 
or forward in sequence through pages that you’ve already seen. Clicking the 
Home button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a miniature 
house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.

183

Figure 11-4: 
Hmm. . . . 
Now 
where’s that 
Liberace 
section?
 
To display the details on a specific album or track, just click it. If you’re inter-
ested in buying just certain tracks (for that perfect road warrior mix), you 
get to listen to 30 seconds of any track — for free, no less, and at full sound 
quality. To add an item to your iTunes Store shopping cart, click the Add 
Song/Movie/Album/Video/Podcast button (sheesh!). When you’re ready to 
buy, click the Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy 
Now button. (At the time of this writing, tracks are 99 cents a pop, and an 
entire album is typically $9.99 . . . what a bargain! As I mention earlier in the 
chapter, Apple now offers iTunes Plus tracks, which are higher in quality and 
aren’t hobbled with copy protection. These tracks are also 99 cents each.)
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address, 
and it also keeps secure track of your credit card information for future 
purchases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or 
retype your credit card information again — iTunes identifies you by your 
user account, and saves your buying method and information for future 
purchases.

184
Part IV: Living the iLife 
The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist called 
Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play ’em, move ’em to 
other playlists, burn ’em to CD or DVD, share ’em over your network, or ship 
’em to your iPod, just like any other item in your iTunes Library. If you rent 
a movie, though, you have a limited amount of time to view the film on your 
MacBook before it’s automatically erased — this is the new millennium, so 
there’s no need to be kind by rewinding.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and video 
could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high costs? 
Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology leader 
has done something the right way!

That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
In This Chapter
 Importing pictures from your hard drive or digital camera
 Organizing images with iPhoto
 Tweaking the appearance of photographs
 Sharing photos with your friends
V
irtually every Mac owner is likely to have a digital camera or a scanner. 
Digital video (DV) camcorders have certainly grown more plentiful over 
the past three or four years, and the iPod is the hottest piece of music hard-
ware on the planet at the time of this writing. The digital camera, however, 
has reached what those funny (strange) marketing people refer to as satura-
tion, and iPhoto was written to address the needs of every person with a digi-
tal camera and a Mac laptop!
With iPhoto ’08, you organize, edit, and even publish your photographs. (It 
sports more features than a handful of Swiss Army knives.) After you shoot 
your photos with a digital camera, you can import them into iPhoto, edit 
them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos that you take yourself, 
either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of digital image files. You 
can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto interface to order a hand-
some hard-bound copy shipped to you.
To sum it all up, I’m willing to bet that iPhoto is either the first or the second 
iLife application that you fall in love with (running neck and neck with 
iTunes). In this chapter, I show you how you can work digital image magic 
with true Apple panache!
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 12-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto. Other 
controls automatically appear when you enter different modes, I cover them 
in upcoming sections of this chapter.

Although I cover these controls as well as the various parts of the window in 
more detail in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re 
looking at:
 
 Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto 
displays.
 
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just 
the last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your 
camera.
 
• You can display photos grouped by events — for example, a birthday 
party or family vacation. Each event covers a specific period of time.
 
• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the source 
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
 
• You can create books, calendars, cards, and slideshows as well.
 
 Viewer: This pane displays the images from the selected photo source.
 
 You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks, 
such as assigning keywords and image editing.

 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
 Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, book, cal-
endar, Web Gallery (for .Mac subscribers), greeting card, postcard, or 
slideshow to your source list.
 
 Read all about .Mac in Chapter 9.
 
 Get Info button: Click this button to display information on selected 
photos.
 
 Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen display 
of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected album 
appear in a film strip across the top of the screen, and you can click 
one to view that image, using your MacBook’s entire screen real estate. 
You can also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter 
for editing and adjusting images. Just move the mouse cursor to the top 
edge of the full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge 
to show the toolbar.
 
 Play Slideshow button: Select an event, album, book, or slideshow in 
the Source list and then click this button to start a full-screen slideshow 
using those images.
 
 Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate 
photos by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to 
search by description and title.
 
 Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation that you 
want to perform on the images you select in the Viewer.
 
 Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of 
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at 
once, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider to 
the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, making it easier to differ-
entiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application (like iPhoto) 
would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one window. Thus, 
Apple developers provide different operation modes (such as editing and 
book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. Each mode allows 
you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes at just about any 
time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and edit — 
and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the chapter with 
sections on publishing and sharing your images.

188
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital 
camera — that is, as long as your specific camera model is supported in 
iPhoto. You can find out which cameras are supported by visiting the Apple 
iPhoto support section at
www.apple.com
Follow these steps to import images:
 
1. Connect your digital camera to your MacBook.
 
 Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into your 
laptop’s USB port, and then prepare your camera to download images. 
(Turn on your camera and switch it to a Transfer mode if necessary.)
 
2. Launch iPhoto.
 
 Launch iPhoto by clicking its icon on the Dock (or in your Applications 
folder). Note that iPhoto will automatically launch by itself if your 
camera or media card reader is recognized. Thumbnails of the images 
on your camera or card reader appear in the iPhoto window, and the 
bottom of the window displays the Import text fields and buttons.
 
 The first time that you launch iPhoto, you have the option of setting its 
auto-launch feature. I recommend this feature, which starts iPhoto auto-
matically whenever you connect a camera to your laptop.
 
3. Click in the Event Name field at the bottom of the window and type 
an event name for the imported photos, like Birthday Party or Godzilla 
Ravages Tokyo.
 
 Keep in mind that the images you’re seeing on your screen haven’t actu-
ally been copied over to your MacBook yet — the photos are still on 
your camera or card reader.
 
4. Click in the Description box and type a description for the event.
 
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into events based on 
the date they were taken, select the Autosplit Events After Importing 
check box to enable it.
 
 If you want to keep all these photos in a single event — even though the 
event spans multiple days — leave the Autosplit Events After Importing 
check box disabled.
 
6. Click the Import button to import your photographs from the camera.
 
 The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize 
them into individual albums or Events.
 
 To select specific images to import, hold down the Ô key and click each 
desired photo. Then click Import Selected rather than Import All.

189
 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from 
the camera afterward.
 
 If you don’t expect to download these images to another computer or 
another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your camera 
automatically by clicking Delete Originals. This saves you a step and 
helps eliminate the guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. (Sorry, 
but I couldn’t resist.)
 
 If you prefer to keep your images on your camera as a safeguard, click 
the Keep Originals button. Nothing’s deleted, and you can delete the 
photos later by using your camera’s built-in delete feature.
“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of 
your digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto, based 
on the date they were taken. For example, you can always display the last 
images you imported by clicking Last Import. If you want to see photos from 
your son’s graduation, they appear as a separate Event. (Both of these orga-
nizational tools will appear in the source list.) Think about that . . . it’s pretty 
tough to arrange old-fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they 
document, but iPhoto makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part 
of the same group! I explain more about Events in the next section.
Organize mode: Organizing and sorting 
your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your 
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your digi-
tal camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t print 
their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection of 
Importing images from your hard drive
If you have a folder of images that you collected 
on your hard drive, a CD, a DVD, an external 
drive, or a USB Flash drive, adding them to 
your library is easy. Just drag the folder from 
a Finder window and drop it into the source list 
in the iPhoto window. iPhoto automatically cre-
ates a new album using the folder name, and 
you can sit back while the images are imported 
into that new album. iPhoto recognizes images 
in several formats: JPEG, GIF, RAW, PNG, PICT, 
and TIFF.
You can drag individual images as well. Select 
the images in a Finder window and then drag 
them into the desired album in the source list. To 
add them to the album displayed in the Viewer, 
drag the selected photos and drop them in the 
Viewer instead.
If you’d rather import images via a standard 
Mac Open dialog, choose File➪Import to 
Library. Simplicity strikes again!

190
Part IV: Living the iLife 
digital photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved in 
iPhoto organize mode. Then you can display them as a slideshow, print them 
to your system printer, use them as Desktop backgrounds, or burn them to 
an archive disc.
The two methods of organizing photos are
 
 An album, which you might be familiar with from older versions of 
iPhoto
 
 Events, which are new in iPhoto ’08
A new kind of photo album
The key to organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each album can rep-
resent any division you like, be it a year, a vacation, your daughter, or your 
daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new album.
 
 Choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the 
source list. The New Album sheet appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Add a new 
album in 
iPhoto.
 

191
 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
 
 If you want to create an empty album (without using any images that 
might be selected), make sure you deselect the Use Selected Items in 
New Album check box to disable it.
 
3. Click Create.
iPhoto also offers a special type of album — a Smart Album — which you can 
create from the File menu. A Smart Album contains only photos that match 
certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating that you 
assign to your images. Other criteria include recent film rolls, text within 
photo filenames, dates when the images were added to iPhoto, and any 
comments you might have added. Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto 
automatically builds and maintains Smart Albums for you, adding new photos 
that match the criteria (and deleting those that you remove from your Photo 
Library)! Smart Albums carry a gear icon in the source list.
You can display information about the selected item in the information panel 
under the source list. Just click the Show Information button at the bottom of 
the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar i-in-a-circle logo. You can also 
type a short note or description in the Description box that appears in the 
Information pane. For more in-depth information, select the desired item and 
then press Ô+I.
 
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer and 
clicking the Show Information button. Click on any of the headings in the pane 
(Title, Date and Time) to display a text edit box. Then simply click in the box 
to make your edits: Type in a new name, for example, or alter the photo’s date 
stamp.
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer 
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove an album photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source list, select the desired album.
 
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
 
3. Press Delete.
 
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t actually remove the 
photo from your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under 
the Library heading in the source list). That’s because an album is just a group 
of links to the images in your collection. To completely remove the offending 
photo, click the Photos entry under the Library heading to display your entire 
collection of images and delete the picture there, too.

192
Part IV: Living the iLife 
To remove an entire album from the source list, just click it in the source list 
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and 
then press Delete.
To rename an album, click the entry under the Albums heading in the Source 
list to select it, and then click again to display a text box. Type the new album 
name and then press Return.
Change your mind? Daughter’s ex is back in the picture, so to speak? iPhoto 
comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and 
it’s like your last action never happened. (A great trick for those moments 
when you realize you just deleted your only image of your first car from your 
Library.)
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mention earlier, Events are essentially a group of images that you shot 
at the same time. iPhoto figures that those images belong together (which is 
usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 12-3 illustrates the Events I created 
in my iPhoto collection.
 
Like an album, an Event can be renamed just by using a different procedure. 
Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to display 
your Events in the Viewer, and then click the existing Event name in the cap-
tion underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears in which you can type a 
new name. Then press Return to update the Event.
Try moving your mouse cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer, and 
you’ll see that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken as 
well as the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really cool 
when you move your mouse cursor back and forth over an Event with many 
images. The thumbnail animates and displays all the images in the Event, 
without using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why can’t I think of 
this stuff? This is the future, dear readers.)
To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click the Event 
thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click the All Events button at 
the top of the Viewer.
 
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s Graduation 
Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on top of another, 
but that’s the easy way. Alternatively, click the Events entry under the Library 
heading in the Source list to display your Events and then hold down Ô while 
you click the Events that you want to merge. Click the Merge button in the 
toolbar at the bottom of the window, or choose Events➪Merge Events. (Forgot 
about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click Merge in the confirmation dialog that 
appears.

While you’re organizing, you can create a brand-new empty Event by choosing 
Events➪Create Event. Feel free to drag photos from albums, other Events, or 
your Photo library into your new Event.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, iPhoto albums and Events are great ideas, but do you really 
expect me to look through 20 albums just to locate pictures with specific 
people or places?” Never fear, good MacBook owner. You can also assign 
descriptive keywords to images to help you organize your collection and 
locate certain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a number of standard key-
words, and you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to 
special events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own key-
word, and anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can 
search for Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no 
matter what Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those 
keywords appear like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose 
View➪Keywords, which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the 
Viewer.)

194
Part IV: Living the iLife 
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
 
 Favorite
 
 Family
 
 Kids
 
 Vacation
 
 Birthday
 
 Checkmark
 
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case. Adding this key-
word displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the image. 
The Checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying specific 
images because you can search for just your check-marked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already been 
assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪Show 
Keywords or press Ô+K to display the Keywords window, as shown in 
Figure 12-4.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Time to add 
keywords 
to these 
selected 
images.
 

195
 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images 
to mark them. Or, click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to 
remove from the selected images to disable them.
Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of 
images by keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the Search 
box at the bottom of the iPhoto window and then choose Keyword from the 
pop-up menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you can click 
one or more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry those 
keywords.
 
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. For example, if an image is identified by only three of 
four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and won’t appear in the Viewer.
 
To search for a photo by title, or by words in its description (which you can 
add by clicking the Info button at the lower-left corner of the window), just 
click in the Search box and start typing. You can also click that same magnify-
ing glass by the Search box to search through your images by date and rating 
as well. (And speaking of ratings. . . .)
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of any-
where from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the 
images that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and 
then assign a rating by using one of the following methods.
You’re gonna need your own keywords
I’ll bet you take photos of other things besides 
just kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto 
allows you to create your own keywords. 
Display the iPhoto Keywords window by press-
ing Ô+K, click the Edit Keywords button in the 
toolbar, and then click Add (the button with the 
plus sign). iPhoto adds a new unnamed key-
word to the list as an edit box, ready for you to 
type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this 
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it 
and then click Rename. Remember, however, 
that renaming a keyword affects all the images 
that were tagged with that keyword. That might 
be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with the 
keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an existing key-
word from the list, click the keyword to select it 
and then click the Delete button, which bears 
a minus sign.

196
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the 
pop-up submenu.
 
 Use the Ô+0 (for your average snapshot) through Ô+5 (front-page mate-
rial) shortcuts.
Sorting your images just so
The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the Viewer 
by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then click 
the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the dis-
play by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source 
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you 
can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise 
order you want them.
 
Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also send 
photos directly to iWeb for use on your .Mac Web site. Click the iWeb button 
in the toolbar and choose either a Photo page or a Blog page. iPhoto automati-
cally sends the selected images or album to iWeb and launches the applica-
tion! You can also use the iPhoto Web Gallery feature to get your photos on 
the Web. (Find more on the Web Gallery at the end of this chapter.)
Edit mode: Removing and fixing stuff 
the right way
Not every digital image is perfect. Just look at my collection if you need 
proof. For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number 
of editing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the 
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit 
panel controls, as shown in Figure 12-5. Now you’re ready to fix problems, 
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a 
photo that’s part of an Event or an album, note the spiffy scrolling photo 
strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to edit just by 
clicking.)
Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display cor-
rectly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direction. 
Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in a 
clockwise direction.

197
 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
Figure 12-5:

Watch 
out, image 
problems!
 
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject? 
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just like folks once 
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With 
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image, which is a great way 
to get Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise 
perfect holiday snapshot.
Follow these steps to crop an image:
 
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit panel.
 
2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.
 
 In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the square to outline the 
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this 
rectangle disappears after the crop is completed.
 
 When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semi-opaque grid 
(familiar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares 
from the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claim-
ing. (Check it out in Figure 12-6.)

198
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Figure 12-6: 
Select the 
stuff that 
you want to 
keep in your 
photo.
 
 
3. (Optional) Choose a preset aspect ratio.
 
 If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific aspect ratio — 
such as 4:3 for an iDVD project — select the Constrain check box and 
then select the size from the Constrain pop-up menu.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess 
up and need to try again — just press Ô+Z.
 
iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to 
travel back through your last several changes.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or 
decrease) the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is auto-
matic, so you don’t have to set anything.
Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies 
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a cam-
era’s flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur with 
both humans and pets.

199
 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
iPhoto can remove that red-eye to turn frightening zombies back into your 
family and friends. Click the Red-Eye button and then select a demonized eye-
ball by clicking in the center of it. To complete the process, click the X in the 
button that appears in the image.
Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines in an 
image (especially those images from scanned prints). Click Retouch, and the 
mouse cursor turns into a crosshair. Just drag the cursor across the imper-
fection. (Actually, you’re matching the pixels in the selected area with the 
pixels surrounding it, which “smooths” out the imperfection.)
Switching to black-and-white or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better 
as a black-and-white (grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia 
tone in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to convert 
an image from color to shades of gray or shades of brown, respectively. (To 
return to the original image, just click in the center square of the effects 
window.)
Adjusting brightness and contrast manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments on brightness and contrast (the 
light levels in your image). To adjust the brightness and contrast, make sure 
that nothing’s selected in the image and then drag the Brightness/Contrast 
sliders until the image looks the way that you want.
 
While you’re editing, you can use the Next button to move to the next image in 
the current album (and the Previous button to revert to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table 
Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto: 
the chance to design and print a high-quality, bound photo book! After you 
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you want, 
and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your book — 
iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company that 
prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish For 
Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in most 
of my books, either.)

200
Part IV: Living the iLife 
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings, 
including an 8.5 x 11" softcover book with 20 double-sided pages for about 
$20 and a hardbound 8.5 x 11" keepsake album with 10 double-sided pages 
for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be added for 70 
cents and $1 a pop, respectively.
iPhoto ’08 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting 
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for produc-
ing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
 
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the 
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better 
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images 
with more than 1,000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions. 
Check your camera’s manual for instructions on how to choose the maximum 
quality and resolution settings.
To create a photo book, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired album in the source list to select it.
 
2. Click the Book toolbar button.
 
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
 
 Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well 
as the background graphics for each page.
 
4. Click Choose.
 
 iPhoto displays a dialog box indicating that you can lay out your photos 
manually or allow iPhoto to do everything automatically (by clicking 
the Autoflow button on the toolbar). Automatic mode is fine, but I’m a 
thorough guy, so I’ll lay out this book manually. You’ll see the controls 
shown in Figure 12-7.
 
 In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current 
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail 
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images 
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag 
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the 
page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail 
strip — it looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display 
thumbnails of each page in your book. (To return to the album image 
strip, click the Photos button under the Page button.)

5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of 
any page from one location to another in the strip.
 
6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of 
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background, 
page numbers, and text fonts.
 
 At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions (about 
a dozen words) to the pages of your photo album. Click any one of the 
text boxes in the page display and begin typing to add text to that page.
 
7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
 
8. In a series of dialog boxes that appear, iPhoto guides you through the 
final steps to order a bound book.
 
 Note that you’re asked for credit card information.
 
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book through a dialup modem connection. The 
images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a broad-
band or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If your only 
connection to the Internet is through a dialup modem, I recommend saving 
your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop or printing ser-
vice instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as PDF button.)

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Introducing Web Gallery!
iPhoto ’08 introduces a new feature — Web Gallery — that does for images 
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends, 
family, business clients, and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your 
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; they can use That Other Kind of 
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you 
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your 
photos. However, you must be a .Mac subscriber to use the Web Gallery 
feature. If you haven’t heard the news on the Apple .Mac service yet, see 
Chapter 9 for the details.
To create a Web Gallery, you designate one or more albums to share by 
selecting them in the source list and then clicking the Add button at the 
bottom left of the iPhoto window. (Hold down Ô while you click to select 
multiple albums.) Click the Web Gallery toolbar button in the sheet that 
appears to display the Web Gallery settings, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of each 
photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their own, and 
even allow photos to be uploaded by other Mac owners using Apple Mail!

 Chapter 12: That Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
By default, any visitor to your .Mac Web site can see your gallery. But what 
if you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the Album 
Viewable By pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audience. (You 
can even require that your visitors enter a login name and password before 
they can receive your photos.)
Click Publish, and you’ll see that iPhoto indicates your images are being 
uploaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the 
source list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the album is 
being “photocasted” with a special networky-looking icon to the right of the 
album, and even a new Web Gallery heading in the Source list. You’re on the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your Web Gallery in the 
Source list and clicking Tell a Friend on the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automati-
cally prepares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new Web 
Gallery! Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy message 
includes instructions for
 
 Folks using iPhoto ’08 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easiest 
Receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they get 
an automatically updated album of the same name that appears in their 
source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto projects. 
From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your Web Gallery by 
choosing File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the subscription 
URL from the e-mail message.
 
 Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers 
can use any Web browser with really simple syndication (RSS) support (like 
the Safari browser that comes with Leopard) or any RSS reader. (In effect, 
your Web Gallery becomes an RSS feed for those without iPhoto ’08.)
 
By default, any changes you make to the contents of the albums in your 
Web Gallery are updated automatically on your .Mac account, and in turn, 
are updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can 
turn this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you 
update often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot of 
data). To display the Check for New Photos setting for Web Gallery, choose 
iPhoto➪Preferences and then click the Web Gallery button on the Preferences 
window toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor 
your iDisk usage from this pane.)

R
emember those home movies that you used to make in high school? 
They were entertaining and fun to create, and your friends were 
impressed. In fact, some kids are so downright inspired that you’re not sur-
prised when you discover at your high school reunion that they turned out to 
be graphic artists, or they’re involved in video or TV production.
iMovie, part of the iLife ’08 suite, makes movie making as easy as those home-
made movies. Apple simplified all the technical stuff, such as importing video 
and adding audio, leaving you free to concentrate on your creative ideas. In 
fact, you won’t find techy terms such as codecs or keyframes in this chapter 
at all. I guarantee that you’ll understand what’s going on at all times. (How 
often do you get a promise like that with video editing software?)
With iMovie, your digital video (DV) camcorder, and the other parts of the 
iLife suite, you can soon produce and share professional-looking movies, with 
some of the same creative transitions and titles used by Those Hollywood 
Types every single day.
If you turn out to be a world-famous Hollywood Type Director in a decade or 
so, don’t forget the little people along the way!

206
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Shaking Hands with the iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level, video editing application, you prob-
ably felt like you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo jet. In 
iMovie, though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically placed.
 
Video editing takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t run 
iMovie at resolutions less than 1024 x 768, nor would you want to.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon on the Dock. (It looks like a star from 
Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, which I find very fitting.) You can also click the 
Application folder in any Finder window Sidebar and then double-click the 
iMovie icon.
To follow the examples that I show you here, follow these strenuous steps 
and create a new movie project:
 
1. Click the Create a New Project button — located under the Project 
Library list — which bears a plus sign.
 
 iMovie displays the window that you see in Figure 13-1.

207

2. Type a name for your project.
 
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
 
 You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3), or 
a display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the 
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose 
the standard (4:3) ratio.
 
4. Click Create.
 
 You’re on your way! Check out Figure 13-2: This is the whole enchilada, 
in one window.

208
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Monitor: Think of this as being just like your TV or computer monitor. 
Your video clips, still images, and finished movie play here.
 
 Browser toolbar: This row of buttons allows you to switch between 
your media clips (video clips, photos, and audio) and the various tools 
that you use to make your film. The selected items fill the browser pane 
below the toolbar. For example, Figure 13-2 illustrates the Transitions 
pane, which appears when you click the Transitions Browser button (go 
figure).
 
 Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are 
stored in the Event pane.
 
 Project pane: In this pane, iMovie displays the elements that you add to 
your movie project.
 
 Playhead: The red vertical line that you see in the Event and the Project 
panes is the playhead, which indicates the current editing point while 
you’re creating your movie. When you’re playing your movie, the play-
head moves to follow your progress through the movie.
 
 Editing toolbar: This strip of buttons allows you to control editing func-
tions such as cropping, audio and video adjustments, voiceovers, and 
selecting items.
 
 Camera Import button: Click this switch to import DV clips from your 
DV camcorder or iSight camera.
Those are the major highlights of the iMovie window. A director’s chair and 
megaphone are optional, of course, but they do add to the mood.
A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack the 
moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun unfortunately intended.) 
However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I follow a linear 
process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide you with an over-
view of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
 
1. Import your video clips into iMovie, directly from your DV camcorder, 
your iSight camera, or your hard drive.
 
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project pane 
and arrange them in the desired order.
 
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes; GarageBand; or external 
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files you recorded) and add them to 
your movie.

209
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive) and 
place them where needed in your movie.
 
5. Add professional niceties — such as audio, transitions, effects, and 
text — to the project.
 
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
 
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a DVD 
that you create and burn with iDVD.
That’s the first step-by-step procedure in this chapter. I doubt that you’ll 
even need to refer to it, however, because you’ll soon see just how easy it is 
to use iMovie.
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic 
if you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife ’08 
applications for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing 
would come in handy.)
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, iSight camera, 
and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think credits) and 
iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your MacBook or MacBook Pro is equipped already with the two extras that 
come in handy for video editing: namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire 
port. Because virtually all DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to 
transfer clips, you’re all set. (The MacBook Air can connect to any DV cam-
corder that uses a USB 2.0 connection.) Oh, and, of course: Your MacBook 
has an iSight camera onboard, so you’re a self-contained movie studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your DV camcorder:
 
1. Plug the proper cable into your MacBook.
 
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
 
 
Some camcorders call this Play mode.
 
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 13-2).
 
 iMovie opens a new window.
 
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu and select your DV camcorder or iSight 
camera.

210
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring 
the controls on your DV camcorder. This allows you to control the unit 
from iMovie. Keen! You also get Import All and Import Checked buttons 
as a bonus.
 
5. To import selected clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Manual.
 
 
To import all clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Automatic, and 
click Import All.
 
6. Select the check boxes next to the clips that you don’t want to import 
to disable them.
 
7. Click the Import Checked button.
 
8. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store 
your clips.
 
 
You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event, or create 
a new Event. Heck, if the Event spanned more than one day, you can 
create a new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
 
9. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
 
 iMovie begins transferring the footage to your Mac and automatically 
adds the imported clips to your Event Library. Note that the footage 
remains pristine on your camera, and is not deleted.
If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can 
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie 
also recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 13-1.

 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
 
1. Choose File➪Import Movies.
 
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
 
 The Large setting (960 x 540 resolution) will save you a significant 
amount of hard drive space. (If you’re not importing 1080i video, use the 
default Large setting and click OK.)
 
 If you are indeed importing 1080i (HD, or high definition) video and you 
want to take advantage of the whopping 1920 x 1080 resolution it pro-
vides, choose the Full setting. (And prepare to lose a nice-sized patch of 
free space on your hard drive!)
 
3. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store 
your clips.
 
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing 
Event, or whether you’d like to create a new Event.
 
 If you want to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up menu 
and choose an Event.
 
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original 
movie intact), or whether the original movie should be deleted after a 
successful import.
 
6. Click Import.
 
 Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and 
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits 
to your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can also use still images to introduce scenes or to sep-
arate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when delineating 
the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas celebrations 
over time.
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
 
 Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button on the 
Browser toolbar (or press Ô+2), and you’ll experience the thrill that is 
your iPhoto library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 13-3). You can 
elect to display your entire iPhoto library or more selective picks, such 
as specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want to add, 
just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.

212
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Figure 13-3: 
Pulling still 
images from 
iPhoto is 
child’s play.
 
 
 Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the 
International Drag-and-Drop society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT, 
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into 
the Project pane as well.
Importing and adding audio from all 
sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background music 
and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get those 
notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by dragging them 
to the Project pane.
You can add audio from a number of sources:
 
 Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects 
button on the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+1) to display the contents of 
your iTunes library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling list, like the 
Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 13-4. (If you’ve exported 
any original music you composed in GarageBand to your iTunes Library, 
you can use those songs in your own movie!) You can add a track to 
your movie by dragging the song entry from the Music and Sound Effects 
browser to the desired spot in the Project pane.

213
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
Figure 13-4: 
Calling on 
my iTunes 
library to

 Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse galloping 
for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click the Show Music and Sound 
Effects button and then click either the iMovie ’08 Sound Effects or iLife 
Sound Effects folders at the top of the scrolling list. To add a sound 
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.
 
 If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes library, it might 
be more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin, 
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your MacBook do the 
digging for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin 
typing a song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to 
those that match the characters you type. To reset the search box and 
display all your songs in the library or selected playlist, click the X icon 
that appears to the right of the box.
 
 Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose 
Audio CD from the scrolling list. iMovie displays the tracks from the CD, 
and you can add them at the current playhead position the same way 
that you would an iTunes songs.
 
 Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking voi-
ceover narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the sidebar, 
“Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.

214
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips that 
you add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the Adjust Audio 
button on the Editing toolbar. The Audio Adjustments window that appears 
includes an array of audio controls that allow you to change the volume of the 
selected clip, or give that audio priority over other audio playing simultane-
ously (such as a sound effect that needs to be clearly heard over background 
music and the video clip).
If your clips dramatically vary in volume, follow along:
Narration the easy way
Ready to create that award-winning nature 
documentary? You can add voiceover narra-
tion to your iMovie project that would make 
Jacques Cousteau proud. In fact, you can 
record your voice while you watch your movie 
playing, allowing perfect synchronization with 
the action! To add narration, follow these 
steps:
 1. Click the Voiceover button on the Editing 
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon — to 
open the Voiceover window.
 2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and 
select the input device.
 
 Your MacBook sports a decent internal 
microphone, but you can always add a USB 
microphone to your system.
 3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
 
 You can monitor the volume level of your 
voice with the left and right input meters. 
Try to keep the meters at 50% or so for the 
proper volume level.
 4. To block out ambient noise levels around 
you, drag the Noise Reduction slider to the 
right if necessary.
 
 If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice 
electronically for a more professional sound, 
select the Voice Enhancement check box. If 
you need to hear the audio from your movie 
project while you speak, select the Play 
Project Audio While Recording check box. 
Note, however, that you need to listen to 
the audio while using a set of headphones 
(plugged into your laptop’s headphone jack) 
to avoid feedback problems.
 5. Click in the desired spot within the Project 
pane where the narration should begin.
 6. Begin speaking when prompted by 
iMovie.
 7. Watch the video while you narrate so that 
you can coordinate your narration track 
with the action.
 8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window to 
stop recording.
 
 iMovie adds a purple icon to the Project 
pane underneath the video with the 
voiceover.
 9. Click the Close button in the Voiceover 
window.

215
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
1. Click the Normalize Clip Volume button.
 
2. Select each clip that you want to set to the same volume.
 
3. Click Normalize Clip Volume again for each clip.
 
4. When you’re done tweaking, click Done.
 
 You can always return the clip to its original volume. Just open this 
window again and click Revert to Original.
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along with 
video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-quality 
transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, I demon-
strate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life furshlug-
giner movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event 
pane. The Dynamic Duo work like this:
 
 Project pane: This pane displays the media you added to your project, 
allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions, and still images in 
your movie.
 
 Event pane: This pane displays your video clips arranged by Event (the 
date they were shot), acting as the source repository for all your clips. 
Movies pulled into iMovie, imported to iPhoto, or added manually from 
the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie
 
1. Move your mouse pointer across clips in the Event pane to watch a 
preview of the video.
 
 The clip’s thumbnail actually displays the video in real time as you move 
your pointer across it. Nice.
 
2. When you decide what to add to your project, you can add the entire 
clip or a selection.

216
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
• To select an entire clip: Right-click the clip thumbnail and choose 
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
 
• To select a portion of a clip: Drag your mouse cursor across the 
thumbnail. A yellow frame appears around your selection.
 
• To change the length of the selected video: Drag the handles that 
appear on either side. If you make a mistake while selecting video, 
just click any empty space within the Event pane to remove the 
selection frame, and then try again.
 
3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in 
the Project pane.
 
 Alternatively, you can press the E key, or click the Add to Project button 
(the first button on the Editing toolbar).
Do this several times, and you have a movie, just like the editors of old used 
to do with actual film clips. This is a good point to mention a moviemaking 
Mark’s Maxim:
 
Preview your work — and do it often.™
iMovie offers two Play Full Screen buttons: one under the Event Library, and 
one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to play, 
and then click the corresponding button. You can also choose View➪Play 
Full Screen to watch the selection. Press the spacebar to pause, and press 
Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your mouse to display a filmstrip 
that you can click to skip forward or backward in the project or Event.
To play a selection from the Playhead position, press Ô+G. (If you’ve ever 
watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, they’re constantly watch-
ing a monitor to see what things will look like for the audience. You have the 
same option in iMovie!)
 
While you’re moving through clips in the Event pane, you might decide that 
a certain clip has a favorite scene . . . or that another clip has material you 
don’t want, like Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ’08 introduces 
Favorite and Rejected scenes, allowing you to view and use your best camera 
work (and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames 
or an entire clip; then click the Mark as Favorite button on the Editing tool-
bar. Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. 
(You can always unmark a Favorite scene by using the Unmark button on the 
Editing toolbar.)

217
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Be gone! To banish a clip from your movie project
 
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the clip (or a selection you made by 
dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection from 
the menu that appears.
The clip disappears — only from the project, not from your hard drive — and 
iMovie automatically rearranges the remaining clips and still images in your 
movie.
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use the iMovie Undo fea-
ture (press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
 
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two in your movie, you can 
easily reorder your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in the 
Project pane. When you release the mouse, iMovie automatically moves the 
rest of your movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want 
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives 
you the following functions:
 
 Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image, allow-
ing you to change the aspect ratio of the media
 
 Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
 
 Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:
 
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane or the Event pane to 
display it in the Monitor (refer to Figure 13-2).

218
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click it.
 
3. Drag your mouse cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of 
the media you want to edit.
 
 Some editing functions automatically apply to the entire clip, such as 
Crop and Rotate.
 
 The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to 
edit that selected part of the clip.
 
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. You 
can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
 
 To crop: Click the Crop button on the Editing toolbar to display the 
frame in the Monitor pane, and then click Crop at the top of the Monitor 
pane. Drag the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section 
you want to keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the 
top of the monitor. When you’re ready, click Done, and everything but 
the selected region is removed.
 
 To rotate: Click the Crop button on the Editing toolbar, and then click 
one of the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each 
click rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the 
clip or image is properly oriented.
 
 To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames 
from around the selected video.
 
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to multi-
ple items! Select the edited clip and choose Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu. 
Then you can select one or more clips and use the Edit➪Paste Adjustments 
menu to apply Video, Audio, or Crop edits. (To apply all three types of edits, 
just choose All.)
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely 
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be far-
ther from the truth, though, because judicious use of transitions can make 
or break a scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding cer-
emony — an abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the 
reception?
 
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to 
overuse the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition 
carefully.

219
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions. To display your transition 
collection, click the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or 
press Ô+4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your mouse pointer over 
the thumbnail to display the transition in miniature.
Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in 
the Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip 
and a still image in the Project pane. In iMovie ’08, transitions are applied in 
real time — you don’t end up checking your mail or tapping your fingers on 
your desk waiting for a transition to render (a fancy word for calculate, which 
means that older versions of iMovie required you to wait while a transition 
was generated).
Even Gone with the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser. 
You find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser toolbar (which bears 
a big capital T), or by pressing Ô+3. You can add a title with a still image, but 
iMovie also includes everything you need to add basic animated text to your 
movie.
Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style. 
You can change the font, size, and color of the text.
To add a title
 
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the browser pane and drag it to 
the desired spot in the Project pane.
 
2. Click the Show Fonts button to make any changes to the fonts or text 
attributes.
 
3. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.
 
4. Click the Play button to preview your title.
 
 iMovie displays a preview of the effect in the monitor with the settings 
that you choose.
 
5. Click Done.
 
 The title appears in the Project pane.

Your movie is complete, you saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re 
wondering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar, 
and you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting 
family and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:
 
 iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes library as a movie. iMovie offers 
recommended settings for your iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and for viewing 
on your MacBook.
 
 .Mac Web Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by post-
ing it within a Web Gallery on your .Mac Web site. (I provide more .Mac 
details to chew on in Chapter 9.)
 
 Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other 
iLife ’08 applications, in four different sizes suited to different display 
devices.
 
 Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive, in one of 
four different sizes.
 
 Export via QuickTime: You can create a QuickTime movie with your 
project by using the QuickTime encoding engine, which allows you 
greater control over the export process and the attributes of the fin-
ished movie file.
 
 
If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime 
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in presen-
tations you create with Apple’s Keynote application as well.
 
 YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the 
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
 
 Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ’08 project 
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the 
option, and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes. For example, 
choosing Tiny will reduce the finished movie as far as possible in file size, 
and the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo.
After you adjust any settings specific to the desired sharing option, click 
Publish (or Save) to start the ball rolling.

H
ow does the old adage go? Oh, yes, it’s like this:
Any DVD movie must be a pain to create. You’ll need a ton of money    
for software, too. And you’ll have to take hours of training that will cause 
your brain to explode.
Funny thing is, DVD authoring — designing and creating a DVD movie — 
really was like that for many years. Only video professionals could afford the 
software and tackle the training needed to master all the intricacies of DVD 
Menu design.
 Take one guess as to the company that changed all that. (No,   it wasn’t Coca-
Cola.) Apple’s introduction of iDVD was (quite literally) a revolution in DVD 
authoring. Suddenly you,  your kids,  and Aunt Harriet could all design and 
burn DVD movies and picture slideshows. Dear reader,   this iDVD thing is huge.
Plus, you’ll quickly find out that iDVD ’08 is tightly connected to all the other 
slices of your digital hub. In plain English, you can pull content from iTunes, 
iPhoto, and iMovie as easily as a politician makes promises. You’ll be creat-
ing DVDs for those special occasions on the fly, on the road. And that, friends 
and neighbors, is the quintessential definition of cool.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
In this chapter, I show you how your MacBook can take on Hollywood as 
well as how you can produce a DVD movie with content that’s as good as any 
you’d rent at the video store!
Hey, Where’s the Complex Window?
Figure 14-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. The iDVD ’08 window was designed 
by the same smart people who brought you the iMovie window. You have 
to supply your own digital video clips, background audio, and digital photo-
graphs, of course.

 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no half-a-dozen secondary windows 
to fiddle with or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve 
had my fill of old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the high-
lights of the iDVD window:
 
 Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD 
window, with good reason. You create your project here. In this case, 
Menu refers to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your Mac’s 
display.
 
 Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from 
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually 
comprises three separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of 
these buttons at the bottom right of the screen:
 
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding White, 
and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain look and 
feel.
 
• Buttons: These options apply to the selected item, such as drop shad-
ows on your text titles or the appearance of your menu buttons.
 
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips 
and photos, to your menu.
 
 Add: Clicking this button opens a pop-up menu (which sports a dapper 
plus sign) from which you can choose one of three types of buttons to 
add to a project. The choices are
 
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button 
to your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click 
a button to display a new submenu that can include additional 
movies or slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on. 
All becomes clearer later in the chapter in the section, “Adding 
movies.”)
 
 In iDVD ’08, a Menu can hold up to 12 buttons, so submenus let you 
pack more content on your DVD. (Older versions of the application 
only allowed six buttons, so don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway, each 
submenu you create can hold another 12 buttons.
 
• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole 
shooting match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to 
your menu.
 
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say, 
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto 
library — click this menu item. (Read all about iPhoto in Chapter 12.)

224
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Inspector Window: Click this button to display the Inspector window 
for the current menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can 
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire menu.
 
 Motion: Click this button (which bears two arrows in a circular shape) 
to start or stop the animation cycle used with the current iDVD theme. 
The animation repeats (just like it will on your finished DVD) until you 
click the Motion button again.
 
 
Need a visual indicator of the length of your menu’s animation cycle? 
Just follow the animation playhead, which moves below the Menu 
display to indicate where you are in the animation cycle. Like other 
playheads in the iLife suite, you can click and drag the diamond-shaped 
playhead button to move anywhere in the animation cycle. Choose 
View➪Hide Motion Playhead to turn off the playhead display.
 
 DVD Map: Click the DVD Map button to display the organizational chart 
for your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a par-
ticular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the 
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly. 
To return to the Menu display, click the DVD Map button again.
 
 Edit Drop Zones: Clicking this button allows you to edit the look and 
contents of a drop zone on your menu. Don’t worry; I explain more 
about drop zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop 
zones,” later in this chapter.
 
 Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a 
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty onscreen remote control that 
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching 
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the 
Stop button on the remote control. Read more about this control in the 
upcoming section, “Previewing Your Masterpiece.”
 
 Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your 
completed DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making 
movies.
Starting a New DVD Project
When you launch iDVD ’08 for the first time (or if you close all iDVD win-
dows), you get the sporty menu shown in Figure 14-2. Take a moment to 
discover more about these four choices.

225
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
 
Figure 14-2: 
Will that 
be create 
or edit, 
manual or 
automatic?
 
Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for 
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should 
be saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder. 
You also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard (full-
screen) aspect ratio of 4:3, or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve 
been watching DVD movies for some time, you recognize these two terms.
 
You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go 
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the 
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on. 
However, you can open any DVD you created by clicking Open an Existing 
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press 
Ô+O, or choose File➪Open Recent.)

226
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or are in a hurry), you can throw cau-
tion to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD offers 
two automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc.
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does most of the work automatically by using the media 
clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create a movie, 
click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer to Figure 14-2). If 
you already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD from the applica-
tion menu bar (to import clips directly from your camera) or File➪OneStep 
DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from your hard drive). I tell you 
more about the OneStep DVD feature later in the section, “A Word about 
Automation.”
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total 
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic 
iDVD button on the top-level menu (as shown in Figure 14-2). If you already 
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to 
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips, and 
choose an audio track.
Unlike OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to your 
liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or save a full-blown 
iDVD project to your hard drive with the results. Sweet.
You can find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later in the section, 
“A Word about Automation.”
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the 
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
 
1. Design the DVD Menu.
 
 Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
 
2. Add media.
 
 You can drag movie files from iMovie HD, still images from iPhoto, and 
music from iTunes.

227
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
 
3. Tweak.
 
 Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
 
4. Finish things up.
 
 Preview and burn your DVD, or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps 
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a 
background image, menu animation, an audio track, and a group of settings 
for text fonts and button styles.
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide 
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, as well 
as more generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technol-
ogy. To view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right 
corner of the iDVD window (see Figure 14-3).
 
Figure 14-3: 
Select a 
new theme 
from the 
Themes 
pane.
 

228
Part IV: Living the iLife 
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on 
your menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.
 
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme, 
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video 
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and 
sound of your DVD Menu completely changes with just the click of a theme 
thumbnail.
Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their 
DVD. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In 
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display! 
To play the video on a DVD player, you select the Movie button with the 
remote control, just like you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and drop 
it onto your DVD Menu display. (Note that only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies 
are supported. MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips might be rejected, or con-
verted when possible.) Alternatively, drag a clip from the iDVD media pane 
into the iDVD window, or click the Add button and choose Add Movie from 
the pop-up menu.
 
iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media pane 
and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips from 
your Movies folder.
Taking advantage of drop zones
Most of Apple’s animated themes include spe-
cial bordered areas marked as drop zones. 
These locations have nothing to do with skydiv-
ing; rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the 
Menu that can hold a single video clip or photo-
graph. When you drag a video clip or an image 
to a drop zone, that clip or picture is added to 
the animation in Apple’s theme! Think about 
that for a moment; I know I did. You can actually 
personalize a Hollywood-quality animated DVD 
menu with your own photos and video!
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone, 
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder 
window and drop it on the desired drop zone. 
You can also drag clips or photos from other 
sources, including the Movie and iPhoto panes 
in iDVD, the iMovie window, or the iPhoto 
window. Drop zones don’t act as links or but-
tons to other content; the stuff you add to a 
menu’s drop zones appears only as part of the 
theme’s animation cycle. You can even drag 
an iPhoto event or album to a drop zone, and 
it will continuously cycle through the images. 
Wowsers!

229
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD menu, 
iDVD adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 14-4. Note that some but-
tons appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a 
Movie button in your DVD menu is determined by the theme you choose.
 
A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD 
aligns buttons and text objects on an invisible grid. However, if you don’t 
want such order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object wherever 
you’d like to turn on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object and 
choose the Free Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD ’08 even 
provides cool new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re 
using Free Positioning. You’ll see them as yellow lines that appear when 
objects are aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.
As I mention earlier, you can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu. To 
add more content than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add 
button and choosing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click 
the submenu button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie 
files into it.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Keep in mind your target audience while you create your DVD. Standard TV 
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number of 
pixels on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t as pre-
cise in focusing that image on the tube. If you select the Standard aspect ratio 
when you create the project, you can make sure that your DVD content looks 
great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:
 
1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of the 
screen).
 
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
 
 You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut.
 
 iDVD adds a smaller rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the 
screen dimensions of a standard TV.
 
3. Place your content within the safe area.
 
 If you take care that your menu buttons and (most of) your background 
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a 
standard television can enjoy your work.
To toggle off the TV Safe Area rectangle, press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HD TVs (or you chose the 
Widescreen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area option 
off. Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any orientation.
Great! Now my audience 
demands a slideshow!
Many Mac owners don’t realize that iDVD can use not only video clips but 
also digital photos as content. In fact, you can add a group of images to your 
DVD Menu via the Slideshow buttons, which allow the viewer to play back a 
series of digital photographs. iDVD handles everything for you, so there’s no 
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard 
TV, make sure that your background image 
has the same dimensions as standard digital 
video — 640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions 
of your image don’t match the dimensions of 
digital video, iDVD will stretch or shrink the 
image to fit, which might have undesirable 
effects. When your image is stretched and 
skewed to fit the DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might 
end up looking like Shrek (or perhaps Fiona).

231
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts to write. Just click the Add button 
at the bottom of the iDVD window and choose Add Slideshow. iDVD places a 
Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by 
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps to 
select your slideshow images:
 
1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to 
the menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 14-5)
 
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
 
3. Click the Photos button (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto 
library and photo albums.
 
4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop 
them into the My Slideshow window.
 
 
You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto 
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.).

232
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their order 
of appearance in your slideshow.
 
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the 
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
 
 The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume 
control below the My Slideshow window.
 
 Alternatively, click the Audio button (top right of the screen) to select 
an audio track from your iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand 
creations.
 
7. Click the Return button on the Slideshow display to return to your 
DVD Menu.
 
If you’re using a menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather 
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on the 
Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the 
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll 
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to use 
for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button again to 
save your changes.
Now for the music . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background music 
for your menu, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD Menu. 
However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if your 
menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the 
current menu is child’s play!
 
1. Click the Media button.
 
2. Click the Audio button to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown in 
Figure 14-6.
 
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder 
display and drop it on the menu background.
 
 iDVD ’08 accepts every sound format that you can use for encoding in 
iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files.
 
4. Click the Motion button (labeled in Figure 14-1) to watch your DVD 
Menu animation cycle set to the new background audio.
 
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation and return to 
serious work.

Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the theme 
you choose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change the 
appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your 
content. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good) 
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.
Using Uncle Morty for your 
DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and anni-
versaries. Follow these steps to change the background of your DVD Menu:
 
1. Click the Inspector button (refer to Figure 14-1).
 
 iDVD displays the Menu Info dialog.

234
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
2. Get an image, using one of the following methods:
 
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background 
well, which appears as a square with a white outline at the top of 
the Menu Info dialog.
 
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.
 
• Use an image from your iPhoto library by clicking the Media button, 
choosing Photos, and then dragging the desired image into the 
Menu display.
 
 iDVD updates the DVD menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is 
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty 
lame, and they appear in two important places:
 
 Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the DVD 
Menu.
 
 Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you 
add to your menu has its own title.
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the text by clicking it.
 
2. Click it again to edit it.
 
 A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit the 
text.
 
3. Type the new text and then press Return to save the change.
Changing buttons like a 
highly paid professional
Customizing Movie buttons? You can do it with aplomb! Follow these steps:
 
1. Click Buttons.
 
2. Click any Movie button from the DVD Menu to select it.
 
 A slider appears above the button, which you can drag to set the thumb-
nail picture for that button in your DVD Menu. (Naturally, this is only for 
animated buttons, not text buttons.)

235
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
 
 Enable the Movie check box to animate the button.
 
3. To create a Movie button with a still image, drag a picture from a 
Finder window or the Media pane and drop it on top of the button.
 
4. To adjust the properties for the button, click the Inspector button.
Table 14-1 describes the button properties. Note that some properties won’t 
appear for text buttons.

Give my creation motion!
Earlier in this chapter, you can read how to use a different image for your 
background, but what about using an animated background? You can use any 
QuickTime movie from your iMovie library to animate your DVD Menu back-
ground! Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
 
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the end 
is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continuously, and 
your animated background flows seamlessly behind your menu.
 
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar, “Taking advantage of drop 
zones.”) You can add a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie 
clip as a background, you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather 
than just a single area of the background.

236
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
 
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector Window button (refer to Figure 14-1).
 
 Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted so that the 
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
 
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
 You can click the Movies button in the Media pane to instantly display 
your iMovie collection.
 
3. Click the Motion button in the iDVD window to try out your new 
background.
 
4. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation cycle.
Previewing Your Masterpiece
Figure 14-7 captures the elusive Preview remote control — truly an awesome 
sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD 
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.

 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu! 
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD 
player, or think outside the box and click a menu button directly with your 
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps to 
a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.
This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To make 
sure that you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you 
expect to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that 
Aunt Edna’s slideshow from her Hong Kong trip actually displays your fam-
ily’s summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something 
needs tweaking, click the Exit button on the controller, and you’re back to 
the iDVD window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.
 
iDVD ’08 allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image 
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — which a good idea if 
you’re out of blank media because you can use the Apple Disk Utility to open 
and mount the disc image as if it were a burned disc. (If you’re a MacBook 
Air Road Warrior without your external SuperDrive, this feature is just plain 
wonderful!) To save an iDVD project as a disc image, choose File➪Save as Disc 
Image (or press Ô+Shift+R).
 
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d like 
to improve the quality of your recorded video, or you’d like to switch video 
modes from NTSC to PAL for a DVD that’s to be sent overseas. If you’d like to 
view or change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click Project➪Project

At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD 
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or 
Magic iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the 
details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and 
you don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. In 
short, iDVD ’08 allows you to plug in your DV camcorder, answer a question 
or two, and then sit back while the application does all the work. iDVD ’08 
imports the DV clips, creates a basic menu design, and burns the disc 
automatically!

238
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any laptop owner. Why not produce a DVD 
right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a gift — in minutes after 
the event is over? Photographers who cover those same special events might 
consider selling a DVD made with OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture 
something incredibly unique — say, a UFO landing or an honest politician — 
you can use OneStep DVD to create an instant backup of the clips on your DV 
camcorder. You could even keep your friends and family up to date with the 
progress of your vacation by sending them a daily DVD of your exploits! (You 
gotta admit that even Grandma would consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD ’08 top-level menu (refer to 
Figure 14-2).
 
 Alternatively, choose File➪OneStep DVD.
 
 iDVD displays the OneStep dialog.
 
 If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your 
MacBook’s hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. 
iDVD prompts you for the video clip to use.
 
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV 
camcorder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. Load a blank DVD when prompted.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and 
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However, 
you can’t import clips directly from your DV camcorder like you can with 
OneStep DVD. Instead, you select the following:
 
 An iDVD theme
 
 Video clips you created with iMovie HD or that you dragged from the 
Finder
 
 Photos from your iPhoto library or dragged from the Finder
 
 Audio from your iTunes playlist or dragged from the Finder
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:

239
 Chapter 14: Creating DVDs on the Road with iDVD
 
1. Click the Magic iDVD button on the iDVD ’08 top-level menu (refer to 
Figure 14-2).
 
 iDVD displays the Magic iDVD window.
 
2. Click in the DVD Title box and type a name for your disc (or project).
 
3. Click to select a theme from the Theme strip.
 
4. Click the Movies button and drag the desired clips into the Drop 
Movies Here strip.
 
5. To add a slideshow, click the Photos button and drag the desired 
photos into the Drop Photos Here strip.
 
6. To add audio for your slideshow, click the Audio button and drag the 
desired song into the Drop Photos Here strip.
 
 No, there is no Drop Audio Here strip, but a speaker icon does appear in 
the first cell of the Drop Photos Here strip to indicate that you added a 
soundtrack.
 
7. Click Preview to see a preview of the finished project, complete with 
remote control. To exit Preview mode, click Exit.
 
8. To open the project in its current form in the main iDVD window, click 
Create Project.
 
 Opening your Magic iDVD work as a full iDVD project gives you full cre-
ative control over what’s been completed so far. (In effect, Magic iDVD 
has acted as an assistant and helped you to quickly build the foundation 
for an iDVD project.)
 
9. To record your completed project directly to DVD, load a blank DVD, 
and then click Burn.
To return to the iDVD main window at any time, just click the Close button on 
the Magic iDVD window.
Recording a Finished Project 
to a Shiny Disc
When you’re ready to record your next Oscar-winning documentary on family 
behaviors during vacation, just follow these simple words.
 
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window.
 
 I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite 
single control in all my 20+ years of computing! It looks powerful, it looks 
sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that. Rather wanton of me.)

240
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, 
load a blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW (depending on the 
media your Mac can handle).
 
 
Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, 
or DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only 
DVD-Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation 
of DVD players are likely DVD+R compatible as well. Therefore, remem-
ber the destination for the discs you burn and choose your media 
accordingly.
 
 After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application keeps 
you updated with a progress bar.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD 
player, or you can load it back into your laptop and enjoy your work, using 
the Apple DVD Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

o you dream of making music? I’ve always wanted to join a band, but 
I never devoted the time nor learned to play the guitar. You know the 
drill: Those rock stars struggled for years to gain the upper hand over an 
instrument, practicing for untold hours, memorizing chords, and. . . . Wait a 
second. I almost forgot. You don’t need to do any of that now!
Apple’s GarageBand ’08 lets a musical wanna-be (like yours truly) make 
music with any MacBook — complete with a driving bass line, funky horns, 
and a set of perfect drums that never miss a beat. In fact, the thousands of 
prerecorded loops on tap in this awesome application even allow you to 
design your music to match that melody running through your head, from 
techno to jazz to alternative rock.
Oh, and did I mention that you can also use GarageBand ’08 to produce pod-
casts on your MacBook? That’s right! You can record your voice and easily 
create your own show, and then share it with others from your iWeb site! 
Heck, add photos if you like. You’ll be the talk of your family and friends and 
maybe even your Mac user group.
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song, 
no matter where you are: a hotel room, a bus, an airplane, or even a record 
store! I also show you how to import your hit record into iTunes so you can 
listen to it on your iPod with a big silly grin on your face (like I do) or add it 
to your next iMovie or iDVD project as a royalty-free soundtrack.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Don’t be too smug when you think of all that practicing and hard work you 
missed out on. What a shame!
Shaking Hands with Your Band
As you can see in Figure 15-1, the GarageBand window isn’t complex at all, 
and that’s good design. In this section, I list the most important controls so 
you know your Play button from your Loop Browser button.

 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
Your music-making machine includes
 
 Track list: In GarageBand, a track is a discrete instrument that you set 
up to play one part of your song. For example, a piece for a classical 
string quartet has four tracks — one each for violin, viola, cello, and 
bass. This list contains all the tracks in your song arranged so that you 
can easily see and modify them, like the rows in a spreadsheet. A track 
begins in the list, stretching out to the right all the way to the end of the 
song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 15-1, I already have one 
track defined — a Grand Piano.
 
 If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast artwork track like the one you see 
at the very top of the list in Figure 15-1 can also appear.
 
 Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet) 
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. 
When a song plays, the timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your 
music. (Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page 
or two.)
 
 Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a spe-
cific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. You 
can drag loops from the loop browser to a track and literally build a 
bass line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips to the time-
line in iMovie to build a film.)
 
 Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the 
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the timeline. You can 
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts 
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a 
section of a song or a loop from the Clipboard, it appears at the current 
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so 
don’t panic.)
 
 Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to your 
song.
 
 Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track, 
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also con-
trol settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the dialog that’s displayed.
 
 View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye 
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click it 
again to close it. You can see more tracks at a time without scrolling by 
closing the Loop Browser.
 
 View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons 
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the Media Browser at 
the right side of the window; click it again to close it. When you close 
the media browser, you can see more of your tracks. If you’re already 
familiar with iDVD or iMovie, you recognize this pane in the GarageBand 
window. Use it to add media (in this case, still images or video clips) to 
your GarageBand project for use in a podcast.

244
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves 
the playhead back to the beginning of the timeline.
 
 Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used 
countless times before, and it works just like the same control on an 
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire 
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To stop the music, click 
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen, and the playhead 
stops immediately. (If playback is paused, it begins again at the play-
head position when you click Play.)
 
 Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the cur-
rent playhead position in seconds. You can also click the time/tempo 
indicator (the blue LED numeric display at the bottom of the window) to 
change the tempo (speed) of your song.
 
 GarageBand ’08 expands the abilities of the default Time/Tempo display. 
Click the icon at the left of the display to choose other modes, such as 
Time (to show a more precise absolute time display) and Project (to 
show the key, tempo, and signature for the song).
 
 Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise 
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but 
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next 
stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working 
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
 
1. Press Ô+N.
 
 GarageBand displays the Project Select dialog.
 
2. Click Create New Music Project to create a new song, or click Create 
New Podcast Episode to create a new podcast.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 15-2. 
(The Tempo, Signature, and Key controls don’t appear if you’re creating 
a new podcast.)
 
3. Type a name for your new song or podcast. If you’re creating a new 
song, drag the Tempo slider to select the beats per minute (bpm).
 
 A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (speed) throughout, 
expressed as beats per minute.

245
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
 
Figure 15-2: 
Start 
creating 
your new 
song here.
 
 
4. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
 
• Time signature: The Time pop-up
 
• Key: The Key pop-ups
 
 If you’re new to music theory (the rules/syntax by which music is created 
and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes that you 
and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 You see the window shown in Figure 15-1. The Ballad Piano 01 section 
in the middle of Figure 15-1 — which I show you how to add in the next 
section — is an example of a typical loop.
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many classi-
cal composers approached a new work in the same way you approach a new 
song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that you want to hear. 
(I imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use GarageBand, 
but I think they did a decent job with pen (quill?) and paper, too.)
If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve likely noticed two problems with 
your GarageBand window.

246
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 The tiny keyboard in the middle of your GarageBand window ain’t 
the greatest. You can record the contents of a software instrument track 
by “playing” the keyboard: that is, clicking the keys with your mouse. 
(As you might imagine, this isn’t the best solution.) If you’re a musician, 
the best method of recording your own notes is with a MIDI instrument, 
which you can connect to your laptop by using the USB port. For now, 
you can banish the keyboard window by clicking the window’s Close 
button. To display it again at any time, press Ô+K.
 
 The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next clas-
sical masterpiece for Grand Piano (the default track when you create a 
new song in GarageBand), that’s fine. Otherwise, you could start with a 
clean slate by choosing Track➪Delete Track on the GarageBand menu 
bar. It’s up to you; you’re the composer!
 
These are the four kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ’08:
 
 Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings. 
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your laptop ren-
ders (builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected 
to your aluminum supercomputer, you can create your own software 
instrument tracks. Read more on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.
 
 In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a non-musician to use.
 
 Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio 
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI 
connection. (Think microphone.)
 
 Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these, which holds photos 
that will appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when 
your podcast is playing. Apple’s iWeb application makes it easy to 
create your own Web pages, complete with your podcasts. I discuss 
more on sending your podcast to an iWeb project, later in this chapter.
 
 Video tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding 
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a 
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More 
on this in the sidebar, “Look! I’m John Williams!,” later in this chapter.)
Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign, 
labeled in Figure 15-1).
 
 GarageBand displays the New Track sheet.
 
2. Select the Software Instrument Track radio button and then click 
Create.

247
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
 
 The New Track sheet disappears, and you’re presented with all those 
great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right.
 
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
 
 I chose Drum Kits.
 
4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as 
Jazz Kit for a jazzy sound.
 
 If you haven’t installed the extra kits along with GarageBand, note that 
you might see disabled instruments appear in the list. Click the right 
arrow to install the complete set of instruments and loops.
 
 Figure 15-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you 
follow these steps.
If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images that will 
appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
 
2. Click the Photos button.
 
 GarageBand displays all the photos in your iPhoto library and film rolls.
 
Figure 15-3: 
The new 
track 
appears, 
ready to 
rock.
 

248
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the 
Track list.
 
 The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add 
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add 
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)
Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add something that you can 
hear. You do that by adding loops to your track from the Loop Browser — 
and Apple provides you with thousands of loops to choose from — as well 
as photos from your Media Browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which 
bears the all-seeing eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 15-4.

249
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
 
If your browser looks different from what you see in Figure 15-4, that’s 
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes 
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the lower-left corner 
of the Loop Browser toggles the browser display between column, musical 
button, and podcast sounds views. Click the middle of the three buttons to 
switch to button mode.
Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a jazz drum kit, but I haven’t added 
a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 15-3.) Follow these steps to search through your 
loop library for just the right rhythm:
 
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
 
 In this example, use the Kits button (which appears as the second 
button in the second row within the Loop Browser). Click it, and a list of 
different beats appears in the pane to the right of the browser window. 
(Check out Figure 15-4 for a sneak peek.)
 
2. Click one of the loops with a green, music note icon.
 
 Go ahead; this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the 
loop nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop 
sounds.
 
 Because I’m using only software instruments in this track (and in exam-
ples throughout this chapter), you should choose only software instru-
ment loops, which are identified with a green, music note icon.
 
3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches immedi-
ately to that loop.
 
 Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both 
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with 
members that never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re 
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
 
 If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search 
field (labeled in Figure 15-4) and type the text you want to match. 
GarageBand returns the search results in the list. (Read all about search-
ing in Chapter 7.)
 
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until 
you find one that fits like a glove.
 
 For this reporter, it’s Lounge Jazz Drums 01.
 
5. Drag the entry to your Jazz Kit track and drop it at the very beginning 
of the timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
 
 Your window will look like Figure 15-5.

250
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Figure 15-5: 
A track 
with a loop 
added.
 
 
Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you can 
undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z immedi-
ately afterward.
Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add additional tracks for each instrument that 
you want in your song:
 
 Each track can have more than one loop.
 
 Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop any-
where on the timeline.
For example, in Figure 15-6, you can see that my drum kit kicks in first, but 
my bass line doesn’t begin until some time later (for a funkier opening).
 
You put loops on separate tracks so they can play simultaneously on different 
instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same track, you hear 
only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same software instru-
ment. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbowroom to bring in 
the entire band at the same time. It’s uber-convenient to compose your song 
when you can see each instrument’s loops and where they fall in the song.

Click the Reset button in the loop browser to choose another instrument or 
genre category.
Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You 
can click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created 
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can 
watch the passing seconds by using either the Time/Tempo display or the 
second rule that appears at the very top of the timeline.) I’m sure that you 
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves 
past the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the 
playback; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 15-1) to 
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.
The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five 
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going, 
you have to do one of three things.

252
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Resize the loop. Hover your mouse cursor over either the left or right 
edge of most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor 
changes to a vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop. 
That’s your cue to click and drag — and while you drag, most loops 
expand to fill the space you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect 
time. By resizing a loop, you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long as 
you like.
 
 Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find 
that resizing it won’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the 
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to 
anywhere from one to five seconds. However, if you move your cursor 
over the top-right corner of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into 
a vertical line with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click 
and repeat the loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the 
same loop automatically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 15-7, 
I repeat the bass loop in Figure 15-6.
 
 Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no 
reason why you can’t use a horn riff loop in your violin track (as long as 
it sounds good played by a violin!). To GarageBand, a software instru-
ment track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you 
add from the Loop Browser as long as that loop is marked with our old 
friend, the green music note.
 
Figure 15-7: 
By re-
peating 
the bass 
loop, you 
can keep 
the thump

253
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
 
You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X), copy (Ô+C), and paste (Ô+V) short-
cuts to um, cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place, both on the time-
line and from track to track. Hold down Option and drag a loop to repeat it, 
and click a loop and drag it anywhere to move it. After all, you’re working 
under Mac OS X — the Leopard breed of cat.
Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between 
two or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
 
 Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the 
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the 
mute, click the speaker icon again.
 
 You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using 
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if 
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to 
the left or right speaker.
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another. 
As you can see in Figure 15-8, my first big hit — I call it Turbo Techno — has 
a number of repeating loops with empty space between them as different 
instruments perform solo. Not bad for an air guitarist who can barely whistle. 
Listen for it soon at a rave near you!

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Using an Arrange track
GarageBand ’08 adds another method you can use to monkey with your 
music: Use an Arrange track to define specific sections of a song, allowing you 
to reorganize things by selecting, moving, and copying entire sections. For 
example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (refrain) of a song, and 
how often it appears during the course of the tune. In an Arrange track, you 
can reposition the entire chorus within your song, carrying all the loops and 
settings within the chorus along with it! If you need another chorus, just copy 
that arrangement.
To use an Arrange track, display it by choosing Track➪Show Arrange Track. 
It appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. Click the Add Region 
button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign), and you see a new 
untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 15-9). You can drag the right side 
of the Arrange region to resize it, or drag it to move it anywhere in the song.
 
Who wants an arrangement full of regions named untitled? To rename an 
Arrangement region, click the word untitled to select it (the Arrange track 
turns blue), and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new 
name for the region and then press Return.
 
Figure 15-9: 
I add a new 
region in 
my song’s 
Arrange 
track.
 

255
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
Now, here’s where arrangement regions get cool:
 
 To move an entire arrangement region, click the region’s title in the 
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like within the song.
 
 To copy an arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag 
the desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
 
 To delete an arrangement region, select it and press Ô+Option+Delete.
 
 To replace the contents of an arrangement region with those of 
another arrangement region, hold down the Ô key and drag the desired 
region’s title on top of the offending region’s title.
 
 To switch two arrangement regions in your song — swapping the con-
tents completely — drag one of the arrangement region titles on top of 
the other and then release the mouse button.
Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? No, 
they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their music in 
the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just like it should. 
You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that you can perform 
include adding effects (pull a Hendrix, and add echo and reverb to your elec-
tric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-tuning the sound of your 
background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
 
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
 
3. Click the Details triangle at the bottom to expand the pane and show 
the settings shown in Figure 15-10.
 
4. Select the check box of each effect you want to enable.
 
 Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust 
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.
 
 GarageBand ’08 provides a new Visual Equalizer window that you can 
use to create a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display 
the Visual EQ window by clicking the Edit button at the far right of the 
Visual EQ controls in the expanded Track Info pane. To change the 
Bass, Low Mid, High Mid, or Treble setting for a track, click and drag the 
equalizer waveform in the desired direction. And, yep, you can do this 
while your song is playing, so you can use both your eyes and ears to 
define the perfect settings!

Automatic Composition 
with Magic GarageBand
In a hurry? Too rushed to snag loops and tweak effects? Never fear, 
GarageBand ’08 can even compose a song automatically! The new Magic 
GarageBand feature provides a wide range of eight different genres of music 
to choose from — everything from blues to reggae to funk and rock.

257
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
To create a new song automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+N to start a new project.
 
 If you’re working on a song, GarageBand prompts you to save it before 
closing the window.
 
2. Click the Magic GarageBand button on the Project Select dialog.
 
 You see an imposing curtain, with a button for each song genre.
 
3. Click the desired genre button.
 
4. To hear the entire song with the default instruments, click Entire Song 
and the click the Play button.
 
 Alternatively, to hear a short sample of the song, click Snippet and then 
click the Play button.
 
5. Click Audition to switch instruments or use the default musical 
arrangement.
 
 The curtains open, and you see each individual instrument on stage. To 
choose a different musical style for an instrument (or a different varia-
tion of the instrument), click it, and then select the desired sound from 
the menu below the stage.
 
 
Click My Instrument (the empty space in the middle of the stage) to add 
your own voice or instrumental, using a microphone or MIDI instrument.
 
6. After the song fits like a glove, click Create Project to open the song as 
a project in GarageBand.
 
 Now you can edit and tweak the song to your heart’s delight like any 
other GarageBand project, adding other software or real instrument 
tracks as necessary.
Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through 
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want to 
share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your iPod 
so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! Just like the other iLife applications that I cover in this 
book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital hub that 
is your MacBook.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Creating MP3 and AAC files
You can create digital audio files in MP3 or AAC format from your song or 
podcast project. (MP3 and AAC are by far the most popular formats for digi-
tal audio because they offer excellent audio quality with far smaller file sizes 
than the older, uncompressed WAV and AIFF formats.) Follow these simple 
steps:
 
1. Open the song that you want to share.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
 
3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name, 
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
 
 You can leave the defaults as-is, if you prefer. Each track that you export 
is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
 
4. From the Compress Using pop-up menu, choose the encoder that 
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
 
 The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for greater 
compatibility.
 
5. From the Audio Settings pop-up menu, choose the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
 
 The higher the quality, the larger the file.
 
 GarageBand displays the approximate file size and finished file informa-
tion in the description box.
 
6. Click Share.
After a second or two of hard work, your laptop opens the iTunes window 
and highlights the new (or existing) playlist that contains your new song.
Sending a podcast to iWeb or iTunes
If you’ve prepared a new podcast episode in GarageBand, you can send it 
automatically to iWeb or iTunes by following these steps:
 
1. Open the podcast that you want to export to iWeb.
 
 Make sure that the Podcast track is displayed. If necessary, choose 
Track➪Show Podcast Track to display it.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Podcast to iWeb (or Share➪Send Podcast to 
iTunes).

259
 Chapter 15: GarageBand on the Go
 
3. From the Compress Using pop-up menu, choose the encoder 
GarageBand should use to compress your podcast file.
 
 Your choices are AAC or MP3 format. AAC files are slightly smaller than 
MP3 files, but the MP3 format is supported by far more music players 
and audio applications.
 
4. From the Audio Settings pop-up menu, choose the proper audio 
quality for the finished file.
 
5. Click Share.
Burning an audio CD
Ready to create a demo CD with your latest GarageBand creation, using 
your MacBook’s optical drive? Follow these steps to burn an audio disc from 
within GarageBand:
 
1. Open the song that you want to record to disc.
 
2. Choose Share➪Burn Song to CD.
 
3. Load a blank disc into your optical drive.

verybody wants a piece. (Of your laptop, that is.)
Perhaps you live in a busy household with kids, significant others, grandpar-
ents, and a wide selection of friends — all of them clamoring for a chance to 
spend time on the Internet, take care of homework, or enjoy a good game.
On the other hand, your MacBook might occupy a college classroom or 
board room at your office — and suddenly your classmate or co-worker 
wants his own Private iDaho on the road warrior, complete with a reserved 
spot on the hard drive and his own hand-picked attractive Desktop back-
ground. (Even flying at 30,000 feet, your co-worker will be eyeing your 
MacBook.)
Before you throw your hands up in the air in defeat, read this chapter and 
take heart! Here you find all the step-by-step procedures, explanations, and 
tips to help you build a safe multiuser MacBook that’s accessible to everyone 
with clean hands.
Oh, and you still get to use it, too. And, no, that’s not being selfish.

Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Once Upon a Time (An 
Access Fairy Tale)
Okay, so you don’t have Cinderella, Snow White, or that porridge-loving kid 
with the trespassing problem. Instead, you have your brother Bob.
Every time Bob visits your place, it seems he needs to do “something” on the 
Internet, or he needs a moment with your MacBook Air to bang out a quick 
message, using his Web-based e-mail application. Unfortunately, Bob’s forays 
onto your laptop always result in stuff getting changed, like your Desktop set-
tings, Address Book, and Safari bookmarks.
What you need, good reader, is a visit from the Account Fairy. Your prob-
lem is that you have but a single user account on your system, and Leopard 
thinks that Bob is you. By turning your MacBook into a multiuser system and 
giving Bob his own account, Leopard can tell the difference between the two 
of you, keeping your druthers separate!
With a unique user account, Leopard can track all sorts of things for Bob, 
leaving your computing environment blissfully pristine. A user account keeps 
track of stuff such as
 
 Address Book contacts
 
 Safari bookmarks and settings
 
 Desktop settings (including background images, screen resolutions, and 
Finder tweaks)
 
 iTunes libraries, just in case Bob brings his own music (sigh)
 
 Web sites that Bob might ask you to host on your computer (resigned 
sigh)
Plus, Bob gets his own reserved Home folder on your laptop’s hard drive, so 
he’ll quit complaining about how he can’t find his files. Oh, and did I mention 
how user accounts keep others from accessing your stuff? And how you can 
lock Bob out of where-he-should-not-be, such as certain applications, iChat, 
Mail, and Web sites (including that offshore Internet casino site that he’s 
hooked on)?
Naturally, this is only the tip of the iceberg. User accounts affect just about 
everything you can do in Leopard and on your laptop. The moral of my little 
tale? A Mark’s Maxim to the rescue:
 
Assign others their own user accounts, and let Leopard keep track of every-
thing. Then you can share your MacBook with others and still live happily 
ever after!™

265
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
Big-Shot Administrator Stuff
Get one thing straight right off the bat: You are the administrator of your 
MacBook. In network-speak, an administrator (or admin for short) is the one 
with the power to Do Unto Others — creating new accounts, deciding who 
gets access to what, and generally running the multiuser show. In other 
words, think of yourself as the Monarch of Mac OS X. (The ruler, not the 
butterfly.)
 
I always recommend that you have only one (or perhaps two) accounts with 
administrator-level access on any computer. This makes good sense because 
you can be assured that no one can monkey with your laptop while you’re 
away from the keyboard. So why might you want a second admin account? 
Well, if you’re away from your laptop — think “daughter takes it with her on 
trip to Europe” — you might need to assign a second administrator account 
to a trusted individual who knows as much about your road warrior as you 
do. (Tell ’em to buy a copy of this book.) That way, if something breaks or an 
account needs to be tweaked in some way, the other person can take care of it 
whilst you’re absent (but without giving that person access to your personal 
data).
In this section, I explain the typical duties of a first-class MacBook 
administrator.
Deciding who needs what access
Leopard provides three levels of individual user accounts:
 
 Admin (administrator): See the beginning of this section.
 
 Standard level: Perfect for most users, these accounts allow access to 
just about everything but don’t let the user make drastic changes to 
Leopard or create new accounts.
 
 Managed with Parental Controls level: These are standard accounts 
with specific limits that are assigned either by you or by another admin 
account.
Assign other folks standard-level accounts and then decide whether each 
new account needs to be modified to restrict access as a managed account. 
Another Mark’s Maxim is in order:
 
Never assign an account admin-level access unless you deem it truly 
necessary.™

266
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Standard accounts are quick and easy to set up, and I think they provide the 
perfect compromise between access and security. You’ll find that standard 
access allows your users to do just about anything they need to do, with a 
minimum of hassle.
Managed accounts (with Parental Controls) are highly configurable so you 
can make sure that your kids don’t end up trashing the hard drive, sending 
junk mail, or engaging in unmonitored chatting. (Note: Attention, all parents, 
teachers, and those folks designing a single public access account for a 
library or organization — this means you.)
Adding users
All right, Mark, enough pre-game jabbering — show this good reader how to 
set up new accounts! Your laptop already has one admin-level account set up 
for you (created during the initial Leopard set-up process), and you need to 
be logged in with that account to add a user. To add a new account, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click 
the Accounts icon to display the Accounts pane that you see in 
Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Add new 
user 
accounts 
here.
 
 
2. Click the New User button — the one with the plus sign at the bottom of 
the accounts list — to display the new user sheet shown in Figure 16-2.

267
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
 
Figure 16-2: 
Fill out those 
fields, and 
you have a 
new user.
 
 
 If your New User button is grayed out, your Accounts pane is locked. 
Remember that you can toggle the padlock icon at the lower-left corner 
of most of the panes in System Preferences to lock or allow changes. To 
gain access, do the following:
 
a. Click the padlock icon to make changes to the Accounts pane.
 
b. When Leopard prompts you for your admin account password (the 
account you’re currently using), enter it. (This is the password 
you entered during Setup, when you create your personal user 
account.)
 
c. Click OK.
 
 Now you can click the New User button.
 
3. Click the New Account pop-up menu and specify the account level 
status.
 
 Choose from Administrator, Standard, or Managed with Parental 
Controls.
 
 You should have only one or two administrator-level users, and your 
account is already an admin account.
 
4. Type the name that you want to display for this account in the Name 
text box. Press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Leopard displays this name on the Login screen, so behave! (For exam-
ple, Bob has only one “o” the last time I checked.)
 
5. (Optional) Although Leopard automatically generates the user’s short 
name (for use in iChat, and for naming the user’s Home folder), you 
can type a new one. (No spaces, please.) Press Tab again.

268
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
6. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account. 
Press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Generally, I recommend a password of at least six characters, using a 
mixture of alpha and numeric characters.
 
7. In the Verify text box, retype the password you chose. Press Tab again 
to continue your quest.
 
8. (Optional) Leopard can provide a password hint after three unsuc-
cessful login attempts. To offer a hint, type a short question in the 
Password Hint text box.
 
 From a security standpoint, password hints are taboo. (Personally, 
I never use ’em. If someone is having a problem logging in to a computer 
I administer, you better believe I want to know why.) Therefore, despite 
the recommendation Leopard shows here, I strongly recommend that 
you skip this field — and if you do offer a hint, keep it vague! Avoid 
hints like, “Your password is the name of the Wookie in Star Wars.” 
Geez.
 
9. Click the Create Account button.
 
 The new account shows up in the list at the left of the Accounts pane.
Each user’s Home folder has the same default subfolders, including Movies, 
Music, Pictures, Sites, and such. A user can create new subfolders within his 
or her Home folder at any time.
Here’s one more neat fact about a user’s Home folder: No matter what the 
account level, most of the contents of a Home folder can’t be viewed by other 
users. (Yes, that includes admin-level users. This way, everyone using your 
MacBook Pro gets her own little area of privacy.) Within the Home folder, 
only the Sites and Public folders can be accessed by other users — and only 
in a limited fashion. More on these folders later in this chapter. (And read all 
about Home folders in Chapter 5.)
Modifying user accounts
Next, consider the basic modifications that you can make to a user account, 
such as changing existing information or selecting a new picture to represent 
that user’s unique personality.
To edit an existing account, log in with your admin account, display the 
System Preferences window, and click Accounts to display the account list. 
Then follow these steps:

269
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
 
1. Click the account that you want to change.
 
 Don’t forget to unlock the Accounts pane if necessary. See the earlier 
section, “Adding users,” to read how.
 
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
 
 For example, you can reset the user’s password, or (if absolutely neces-
sary) upgrade the account to admin level.
 
3. Click the picture well and then click a thumbnail image to represent 
this user (as shown in Figure 16-3).
 
Figure 16-3: 
Pick the 
image 
that best 
represents 
a user.
 
Picture well
 
 An easy way to get an image is to use one from your hard drive. Click 
Edit Picture and then drag a new image from a Finder window into the 
picture well. (Alternatively, you could click Edit Picture and then click 
the Snapshot button — which bears a tiny camera — to grab a picture 
from your iSight video camera. When you’ve captured the essence of 
your subject as a photo, click Set to return to the Accounts pane.)
 
 Leopard displays this image in the Login list next to the account name.
 
4. When everything is correct, press Ô+Q to close the System 
Preferences dialog.
 
 No need to save your changes (as a separate step) within System 
Preferences because Leopard does that automatically when you close 
the System Preferences window.

270
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
Standard-level users have some control over their accounts — they’re not 
helpless, after all. Standard users can log in, open System Preferences, and 
click Accounts to change the account password or picture, as well as the My 
Card assigned to them in Leopard Address Book. All standard users can also 
set up Login Items, which I cover later in this chapter. Note, however, that 
managed users might not have access to System Preferences at all, so they 
can’t make changes. (Read about this in the upcoming section, “Managing 
access settings for an account.”
I banish thee, Mischievous User!
Not all user accounts last forever. Students graduate, co-workers quit, kids 
move out of the house (at last!), and Bob might even find a significant other 
who has a faster cable modem. We can only hope.
Anyway, no matter what the reason, you can delete a user account at any 
time. Log in with your admin account, display the Accounts pane in System 
Preferences, and then follow these steps to eradicate an account:
 
1. Click the account that you want to delete.
 
2. Click the Delete User button (which bears the Minus Sign of Doom). 
Refer to Figure 16-2.
 
 Leopard displays a confirmation sheet, as shown in Figure 16-4. By 
default, the contents of the user’s Home folder are saved in a disk image 
file, which you can restore with Disk Utility — in the Deleted Users 
folder.
 
Figure 16-4: 
This is your 
last chance 
to save the 
stuff from a 
deleted user 
account.
 

271
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
 
3. To clean up completely, select the Delete the Home Folder radio 
button and then click OK.
 
 Leopard wipes everything connected with the user account off your 
hard drive.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to close the System Preferences dialog.
Time once again for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Always delete unnecessary user accounts. Otherwise, you’re leaving holes in 
your laptop’s security.™
Setting up Login Items and 
Parental Controls
Every account on your MacBook can be customized. Understandably, some 
settings are accessible only to admin-level accounts, and others can be 
adjusted by standard-level accounts. In this section, I introduce you to the 
things that can be enabled (or disabled) within a user account.
Automating with Login Items
Login Items are applications or documents that can be set to launch or load 
automatically as soon as a specific user logs in — for example, Apple Mail or 
Address Book. In fact, a user must be logged in to add or remove Login Items. 
Even an admin-level account can’t change the Login Items for another user.
 
A user must have access to the Accounts pane within the System Preferences 
window in order to use Login Items. As you can read in the following section, 
a user can be locked out of System Preferences, which makes it more difficult 
for Login Items to be added or deleted for that account. (Go figure.)
To set Login Items for your account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the 
Accounts icon.
 
2. Click the Login Items tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 16-5.
 
3. Click the Add button (with the plus sign) to display a file selection 
sheet.

272
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
Figure 16-5: 
Add apps to 
your Login 
Items list.
 
 
4. Navigate to the application you want to launch each time you log in, 
click it to select it, and then click Add.
 
 If you’re in the mood to drag and drop, just drag the applications you 
want to add from a Finder window and drop them directly into the list.
 
5. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your changes.
 
Login Items are launched in the order that they appear in the list, so feel free 
to drag the items into any order you like.
Managing access settings for an account
A standard-level account with restrictions is a managed account. (You can 
read about these accounts earlier in this chapter.) With these accounts, you 
can restrict access to many different places within Leopard and your laptop’s 
applications via Parental Controls. (Naturally, admin-level accounts don’t 
need Parental Controls because an admin account has no restrictions.)
 
In short, Parental Controls come in handy in preventing users — family 
members, students, co-workers, friends, or the public at large — from damag-
ing your computer, your software, or Leopard itself. If an account has been 
restricted with Parental Controls, the account description changes from 
Standard to Managed in the Accounts list.
To display the Parental Controls for a standard account, start here:
 
1. Log in with an admin-level account.
 
2. Open System Preferences and then click Accounts.
 
3. Click the Standard account in the list and then select the Enable 
Parental Controls check box.

273
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
Now click the Open Parental Controls button to display the specific catego-
ries (tabs) that you see in Figure 16-6:
 
 System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second) 
affect what the user can do within Leopard as well as what the Finder 
itself looks like to that user.
 
 Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. 
If you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for 
this user, select the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it. 
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
 
• Allow Unrestricted Access: Select this radio button to allow unfet-
tered access for this user.
 
• Try to Limit Access: You can allow Safari to automatically block 
Web sites that it deems “adult.” To specify particular sites that 
Safari should allow or deny, click the Customize button. On the 
Customize sheet, click the Add button under the Always Allow 
These Sites list box to enter the Web addresses that you approve; 
then click the Add button under the Never Allow These Sites list 
box to enter those Web addresses to be banned.
 
• Allow Access to Only These Websites: Select this radio button to 
specify which Web sites that the user can view. To add a Web 
site, click the Add button (which bears a plus sign); Leopard then 
prompts you for a title and the Web site address.
 
Figure 16-6:

274
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
 Mail & iChat: Select the Limit Mail and the Limit iChat check boxes to 
specify the e-mail and instant-messaging addresses that this user can 
communicate with. To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat 
with, click the Add button.
 
 
If you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to 
someone not in the list, select the Send Permission Requests To check 
box to enable it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.
 
 Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout with 
pure joy! You can limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage 
per weekday (Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of 
hours of usage per weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bed-
time computer curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days.
 
 Logs: Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files (which 
track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are 
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations 
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can 
monitor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are 
enabled or disabled from other locations within Leopard: For example, 
the log showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled from the 
Content panel that I describe a little earlier, whereas the applications 
log is enabled from the System panel. iChat logging is turned on from the 
Preferences dialog within the iChat application.
 
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls 
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the 
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System tab to 
modify these settings:
 
 Use Simple Finder: The Simple Finder is a great idea for families and 
classrooms with smaller children. For the ultimate in restrictive Leopard 
environments — think public access or kiosk mode — you can assign 
the Simple Finder to an account. Even the Dock itself is restricted, sport-
ing only the Finder icon, Trash, the Dashboard, and those folders that 
allow the user to access their documents and applications.
 
 Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is enabled, you can 
select the specific applications that appear to the user. These restric-
tions are in effect whether the user has access to the full Finder or just 
the Simple Finder.
 
• To allow access to all the applications of a specific type: Select the 
check box next to the desired group heading to enable it. This 
includes iLife, iWork, Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities.

275
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
 
• To restrict access to all applications within a group: If a group head-
ing check box is enabled and you want to deny access to all the 
applications in that group, clear the check box next to the heading 
to disable it.
 
• To toggle restriction on and off for specific applications within these 
groups: Click the triangle icon next to each group heading to 
expand its list and then either mark or clear the check box next to 
the desired applications. Leopard denotes partial access within 
a group — a mixture of full and restricted applications — with a 
dash mark in the group heading check box.
 
 
To locate a specific application, click in the Search box and type 
the application name.
 
• To add a new application to the Allow list: Drag its icon from the 
Finder and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add 
an application, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle 
access to it on and off like the applications in the named groups.
 
 Can Administer Printers: With this check box enabled, the user can 
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in 
System Preferences. If disabled, the user can still print to the default 
printer and switch to other assigned printers, but can’t add or delete 
printers.
 
 Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user 
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in 
Mac OS X. (Note: If you load a third-party recording program, such as 
Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
 
 Can Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to 
change the account password.
 
 
If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of 
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk 
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use 
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability

posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your 
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)

Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Mundane Chores for 
the Multiuser Laptop
After you’re hip on user accounts and the changes you can make to them, 
turn to a number of topics that affect all users of your MacBook — things like 
how they log in, how a user can share information with everyone else on the 
computer, and how each user account can be protected from unscrupulous 
outsiders with state-of-the-art encryption. (Suddenly you’re James Bond! 
I told you Leopard would open new doors for you.)
Logging on and off in 
Leopard For Dummies
Hey, how about the login screen itself? How do your users identify them-
selves? Time for another of my “Shortest books in the For Dummies series” 
special editions. (The title’s practically longer than the entire book.)
Leopard offers four methods of logging folks in to your multiuser laptop:
 
 The username and password login: This is the most secure type of login 
screen you’ll see in Leopard because you have to actually type your 
account username and your password. (A typical hacker isn’t going to 
know all the usernames on your MacBook.) Press Return or click the Log 
In button to compete the process.
 
 When you enter your username and password, you see bullets rather 
than your password because Leopard displays bullet characters to 
ensure security. Otherwise, someone could simply look over your shoul-
der and see your password.
 
 
Keep your laptop secure: Use a username and password login, and 
always choose a password that’s tough to guess.™
 
 The list login: This login screen offers a good middle of the road 
between security and convenience. Click your account username in the 
list and type your password when the login screen displays the pass-
word prompt. Press Return or click the Log In button to continue.
 
 Fast User Switching: This feature allows another user to sit down and 
log in while the previous user’s applications are still running in the back-
ground. This is perfect for a fast e-mail check or a scan of your eBay bids 
without forcing someone else completely off the MacBook. When you 
turn on Fast User Switching, Leopard displays the currently active user’s 
name at the right side of the Finder menu bar.

277
 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
 
 To switch to another account
 
a. Click the current user’s name in the Finder menu (see Figure 16-7).
 
b. Click the name of the user who wants to log in.
 
 Leopard displays the login window, just as if the laptop had been 
rebooted.
 
 
The previous user’s stuff is still running, so you definitely 
shouldn’t reboot or shut down the computer!
 
 To switch back to the previous user
 
a. Click the username again on the Finder menu.
 
b. Click the previous user’s name.
 
 For security, Leopard prompts you for that account’s login 
password.
 
 Auto login: This is the most convenient method of logging in but offers 
no security whatsoever. Leopard automatically logs in the specified 
account when you start or reboot your MacBook.

278
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
 I strongly recommend that you use auto login only if
 
• Your laptop is in a secure location — say, your home or a locked 
office. If you’re on the road, you and your data need the protection 
of a username and password login!
 
• You are the only one using your laptop.
 
• You’re setting up a public-access laptop kiosk, in which case you 
want your MacBook to immediately log in with the public account.
 
 Working in a public environment? Never set an admin-level account 
as the auto login account. This is the very definition of ASDI, or A 
Supremely Dumb Idea.
To set up a username/password or list login, open System Preferences, 
click the Accounts icon, and then display the Login Options settings (see 
Figure 16-8). Select the List of Users radio button for a list login screen, or 
select the Name and Password radio button to require your users to type 
their full username and password.
To enable Fast User Switching, mark the Enable Fast User Switching check 
box (also shown in Figure 16-8).
To set Auto Login, click the Automatic Login pop-up menu and choose 
the account that Leopard should use (shown also by the now-legendary 
Figure 16-8).

Logging out of Leopard all the way (without Fast User Switching) is a cinch. 
Just click the Apple menu (Ú) and then choose Log Out. (From the keyboard, 
press Ô+Shift+Q.) A confirmation dialog appears that will automatically log

 Chapter 16: Your Laptop Goes Multiuser
you off in one minute. And that one minute is important because if someone 
walks up and clicks Cancel, he’ll be using your laptop with your account! 
Your MacBook returns to the login screen, ready for its next victim. Heed this 
Mark’s Maxim:
 
Always click the Log Out button on the logout confirmation dialog before you 
leave your MacBook.™
Interesting stuff about sharing stuff
You might wonder where shared documents and files reside on your 
MacBook. That’s a good question. Like just about everything in Leopard, 
there’s a simple answer. The Users folder on your laptop has a Shared folder 
within it. To share a file or folder, it should be placed in the Shared folder.
 
You don’t have to turn on File Sharing in the Sharing pane of System 
Preferences to use Shared folders on your laptop. Personal File Sharing affects 
only network access to your machine by users of other computers.
Each user account on your MacBook also has a Public folder within that 
user’s Home folder. This is a read-only folder that other users on your laptop 
(and across the network) can access: They can only open and copy the files 
that it contains. (Sorry, no changes to existing documents from other users, 
or new documents from other users.) Every user’s Public folder contains a 
Drop Box folder, where other users can copy or save files but can’t view the 
contents. Think of the Drop Box as a mailbox where you drop off stuff for the 
other user.
Encrypting your Home folder can be fun
Allowing others to use your Mac laptop always incurs a risk — especially if 
you store sensitive information and documents on your computer. Although 
your login password should ensure that your Home folder is off limits to 
everyone else, consider an extra level of security to prevent even a dedicated 
hacker from accessing your stuff. All it takes is a forgetful moment in an air-
port or classroom, and your personal and business data is suddenly within 
someone else’s reach. Adequate security is A Supremely Good Thing!
To this end, Leopard includes FileVault, which automatically encrypts the 
contents of your Home folder. Without the proper key (in this case, either 
your login password or your admin’s master password), the data contained 
in your Home folder is impossible for just about anyone to read. (I guess the 
FBI or NSA would be able to decrypt it, but they’re not likely a worry at your 
place!)

280
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
The nice thing about FileVault is that it’s completely transparent to you and 
your users. In other words, when you log in, Leopard automatically takes 
care of decrypting and encrypting the stuff in your Home folder for you. You 
literally won’t know that FileVault is working for you (which is how comput-
ers are supposed to work).
To turn on FileVault protection for a specific account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the 
Security icon.
 
2. Click the FileVault button.
 
3. If necessary, click Set Master Password to create a master password.
 
 
You need to be logged in with an admin-level account to set a master 
password. However, this needs to be done only once, no matter how 
many accounts you’re hosting on your MacBook. When using this 
master password, any admin-level user can unlock any Home folder for 
any user.
 
 
Before you move to Step 4, note that you must be logged in using the 
account that requires the FileVault protection. (Therefore, if you had 
to log in using your admin-level account to set a master password, you 
have to log out and log in again using the account you want to protect. 
Arrgh.)
 
4. Click the Turn on FileVault button.
 
5. Enter your account’s login password when prompted and then click OK.
 
6. Click the Turn on FileVault button on the confirmation screen.
 
7. After Leopard encrypts your Home folder and logs you out, log in 
again normally.
 
 You’re done!
 
Remember those passwords. Again, do not forget your account login pass-
word, and make doggone sure that your admin user never forgets the master 
password! If you forget these passwords, you can’t read anything in your 
Home folder, and even the smartest Apple support technician will tell you that 
nothing can be done.

I
n my book, network access ranks right up there with air conditioning 
and the microwave oven. Like other “I can’t imagine life without them” 
kinds of technologies, it’s hard to imagine sharing data from your laptop with 
others around you without a network. Sure, I’ve used a sneakernet (the old-
fashioned term for running back and forth between computers with a floppy 
disk), but for a long time now, Apple computers don’t even come with floppy 
drives. (Heck, the MacBook Air doesn’t even come standard with an optical 
drive any more!)
Nope, networking is here to stay. Whether you use it to share an Internet 
connection, challenge your friends to a nice relaxing game of WWII battlefield 
action, or stream your MP3 collection to other computers that use iTunes, 
you’ll wonder how you ever got along without one. In this chapter, I fill you in 
on all the details you need to know to get your road warrior hooked up to a 
new (or an existing) network.
What Exactly Is the Network Advantage?
If you have other family members with computers or if your MacBook is in 
an office with other computers (including those rascally PCs), here’s just a 
sample of what you can do with a network connection.

282
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
 Share an Internet connection. This is the major reason why many fami-
lies and most small businesses install a network. Everyone can simul-
taneously use the same digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable Internet 
connection on every computer on the network.
 
 Share a printer. You say your fellow employee — or even worse, your 
big sister — has a great printer connected to their computer? Luckily, 
that printer can be shared with anyone across your network.
 
 Copy and move files of all sizes. Need to get a large iDVD project from 
one Mac to another? With a network connection, you can accomplish 
this task in just minutes. Otherwise you’d have to burn that file to a 
DVD-R or use an external hard drive. A network connection makes copy-
ing as simple as dragging the project folder from one Finder window to 
another. (MacBook Air owners, take note!)
 
 Share documents across your network. Talk about a wonderful col-
laboration tool. For example, you can drop a Word document or Keynote 
presentation file in your Public folder and ask for comments and edits 
from others in your office (or around the planet).
 
 Stream music and video. With iTunes, you can share your audio and 
video media collection on your MacBook Pro with other Macs and PCs 
on your network. Your eyes and ears can’t tell the difference!
 
 Play multiplayer games. Invite your friends over and tell ’em that you’re 
hosting a LAN party (the techno-nerd term for a large gathering of game 
players, connected through the same network, all playing the same mul-
tiplayer game. (Suddenly you’ll see firsthand just how devious a human 
opponent can be.) Each participant needs to buy a copy of the same 
game, naturally, but the fun you’ll have is worth every cent you spend. 
Don’t forget the chips!
If your laptop isn’t within shouting distance of an existing network or you 
don’t plan on buying any additional computers, stop right here because a 
lone MacBook hanging out in your home with no other computers around 
won’t need a network.
 
If you have just your Mac laptop and an Internet connection (either through 
a dialup modem or a high-speed DSL/cable modem) and you have no plans to 
add another computer or a network printer, a network isn’t necessary.
Should You Go Wired or Wireless?
After you decide that you indeed need a network for your home or office, you 
have another decision to make: Should you install a wired network (running 
cables between your computers) or a wireless network? Heck, should you 
throw caution completely to the wind and build a combination network with 
both wireless and wired hardware?

283
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
Your first instinct is probably to choose a wireless network for convenience. 
After all, this option allows you to eliminate running cables behind furniture 
(or in the ceiling of your office building). Ah, but I must show you the advan-
tages to a wired network as well. Table 17-1 shows the lowdown to help you 
make up your mind.

As I call it, here are the advantages of choosing a wired or a wireless network 
setup:
 
 Wired: Using a wired network offers two significant perks over a wire-
less network:
 
• Faster speeds: In general, wired networks that are compatible with 
your MacBook are many times faster than the fastest 802.11n wire-
less connections.
 
 The performance of a wireless connection can be compromised 
by interference (from impeding structures, such as concrete walls; 
and from household appliances, such as some wireless phones and 
microwave ovens) and by distance.
Grafting wireless access to a wired network
Maybe you’re caught in the middle, choosing 
between wired and wireless networking? Or 
perhaps you’re already using a wired network 
but would be absolutely thrilled by the idea 
of sitting on your deck in the sunshine whilst 
checking your e-mail on your laptop, unteth-
ered. By combining both technologies, you 
can get the faster transfers of a wired network 
between all the computers in your office and 
the freedom you crave.
That is the configuration I use in my home office. 
I use a wireless base station that also includes 
a built-in wired switch, which is a very common 
feature in today’s wireless routers and base 
stations. My family gets all the convenience 
a wireless network offers, and everyone can 
connect to the Internet from anywhere in our 
house. On the other hand, my office computers 
have the faster performance and tighter secu-
rity of a wired network. Sassy indeed!

284
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
• Better security: A wired network doesn’t broadcast a signal that can 
be picked up outside your home or office, so it’s more secure.
 
 Hackers can attack through your Internet connection, though. 
Hence the section, “USE YOUR FIREWALL!,” later in this chapter.
 
 Wireless: A wireless connection really has only one advantage, but 
it’s a big one: convenience (which, in this case, is another word for 
mobility for all your networked devices). Laptop owners crave this 
independence — a freedom that desktop computers can only dream 
about.
 
 Accessing your network anywhere within your home or office — without 
cables — is so easy. You can also easily connect a wireless printer. And 
when using an AirPort Express mobile Base Station, even your home 
stereo can get connected to your MP3 collection on your MacBook. Read 
more about Base Stations later on.
Be a Pal — Share Your Internet!
Time to see what’s necessary to share an Internet connection. In this section, 
I cover two methods of connecting your network to the Internet. (And before 
you open your wallet, keep in mind that you might be able to use your laptop 
to share your broadband connection across your network!)
Using your MacBook as a sharing device
You can use your MacBook to provide a shared Internet connection across a 
simple wireless network, using either
 
 A broadband DSL or cable connection
 
 An external USB dialup modem
 
 I recommend sharing a dialup modem Internet connection only if you 
have no other option. A dialup modem connection really can’t handle 
the data transfer speeds for more than one computer to access the 
Internet comfortably at one time. (In plain English, an external USB 
modem that you add to your MacBook isn’t fast enough for both you and 
your significant other to surf the Web at the same time.) Sharing a dialup 
connection just isn’t practical.
In these configurations, the only hardware you need to buy for your wired 
network is an external USB modem and an Ethernet switch (more on this 
device in the next section).

285
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
Because your MacBook has built-in AirPort Extreme wireless hardware, it’s 
easy to share your broadband connection wirelessly with other computers in 
your home or office.
 
In either configuration, your laptop uses the Mac OS X Leopard built-in 
Internet connection–sharing feature to get the job done, but your Mac must 
remain turned on to allow Internet sharing. I show you how to do this in the 
upcoming section, “Network Internet connections.”
Using a dedicated Internet-sharing device
You can also choose to use a dedicated Internet-sharing device (often called 
an Internet router) to connect to your cable or DSL modem. You do have 
to buy this additional hardware, but here’s the advantage: Your MacBook 
doesn’t have to remain turned on just so everyone can get on the Internet.
Internet routers usually include either wired or wireless network connec-
tions, and many include both.
Setting up an Internet router is usually a pretty simple matter, but the 
configuration depends on the device manufacturer and usually involves a 
number of different settings in System Preferences that vary according to the 
model of router you’re installing. Grab a diet cola, sit down with the router’s 
manual, and follow the installation instructions you’ll find there. (In many 
cases, you must set up your cable or DSL modem as a bridge between your 
ISP and your router, which should be covered in your modem and router 
manuals as well.)
 
Most Internet routers offer a DHCP server, which automatically assigns 
Internet protocol (IP) addresses, and I strongly recommend that you turn on 
this feature! (You can read more on DHCP later in the chapter, in the sidebar 
titled, “The little abbreviation that definitely could.”)
What Do I Need to Connect?
Most normal folks — whom I define as those who have never met a network 
system administrator, and couldn’t care less — think that connecting to a 
network probably involves all sorts of arcane chants and a mystical symbol 
or two. In this section, I provide you with the shopping list that you need to 
set up a network — or connect to a network that’s already running.

286
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Wireless connections
Today’s Mac laptops come complete with a built-in AirPort Extreme wire-
less card, so if you already have an AirPort Extreme or Express Base Station, 
you’re set to go. Otherwise, hold on tight while I lead you through the hard-
ware requirements for wireless networking.
 
The maximum signal range — and effectiveness — of any wireless network can 
be impeded by intervening walls or by electrical devices, such as microwave 
ovens and some wireless phones, all of which can generate interference.
Connecting a MacBook to an existing wireless network
Connecting a MacBook to an existing wireless network requires no extra 
hardware because your hardware is already built in. (Whew. That was easy!)
Using a base station to go wireless
If you decide that you want to build your own wireless network, you eschew 
cables, or you want to add wireless support to your existing wired network, 
you need a base station. (If you do have an existing wired network, the base 
station can act as a bridge between computers using wireless hardware and 
your wired network, allowing both types of computers to talk to each other.) 
Such a wireless base station will either have
 
 A port that can connect to your existing wired network’s switch
 
 A full built-in switch for wired connectivity (which means you can sell 
your old wired Ethernet switch to your sister in Tuscon)
And, of course, a base station can simply act as a central switch for your 
wireless network (with no support for a wired network at all).
You can use either a cool Apple Base Station or a boring 802.11n generic 
wireless base station; however, the Apple hardware requires less configura-
tion and tweaking. (Sounds like a Mark’s Maxim!)
 
If you don’t want the hassle of tweaking PC hardware to accommodate your 
Mac laptop, buy Apple hardware and software.™
Apple Base Station models
As listed in upcoming Table 17-2, your MacBook can work with four different 
Apple Base Station models for wireless networking:

287
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
 
 AirPort Extreme
 
 I recommend using AirPort Extreme if your network needs an enhanced 
antenna, which provides greater range. You can read about connectivity 
ranges in upcoming Table 17-2.
 
 Time Capsule
 
 Apple’s Time Capsule unit (an external wireless backup unit) isn’t just a 
wireless remote hard drive: It can also act as a full AirPort Extreme Base 
Station. In fact, the wireless specifications for a Time Capsule unit and 
an AirPort Extreme Base Station are almost identical.
 
 AirPort Express (as shown in Figure 17-1)
 
 I recommend using AirPort Express if you want to
 
• Carry your wireless base station with you. Express is much smaller 
than the other Apple Base Station models. (Think “party on the 
patio” or a LAN gaming get-together at a friend’s house.)
 
• Connect your home stereo for wireless music streaming. You can use 
the AirTunes feature in iTunes.
 
 AirPort (discontinued)
 
 You might find an original 802.11b or 802.11g AirPort Base Station on 
eBay or at a garage sale. Go ahead and pick it up if you want to save 
cash, unless you’re considering multiplayer gaming or using high-speed 
file transfers over your wireless network.
 
 The 802.11n standard used by the AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, and 
AirPort Express Base Stations delivers a connection that’s several times 
faster than the old AirPort Base Station’s 802.11b/802.11g standards. 
802.11n is also compatible with all the older standards — 802.11b/a/g — 
so I highly recommend that you stick with 802.11n in the future. It plays 
well with others, and at warp speed to boot!

The names of the Apple Base Stations are irritatingly similar; Apple usually 
does a better job differentiating their product names. Jot down the name 
of your model on a Stickie on your laptop’s Desktop just so you don’t get 
confused.
Installing an Apple Base Station is simple:
 
1. If you have a DSL or cable modem, connect it to the WAN (wide area 
network) port on the Base Station with an Ethernet cable.
 
2. If you have an existing wired Ethernet computer network using a 
switch or router, connect it to the Ethernet LAN port on the Base 
Station with an Ethernet cable.
 
 Remember that only the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule stations 
have a WAN port.

289
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
 
3. If you have a USB printer, connect it to the USB port on the Base 
Station.
 
 As I mention in Table 17-2, older AirPort Base Stations didn’t have USB 
ports.
 
 I cover the steps to share a printer in the upcoming section, “Sharing a 
network printer.”
 
4. Connect the power cable from the AC power adapter.
 
 The AirPort Express and Time Capsule units have a built-in AC adapter, 
so if you’re using one of these models, just plug the device itself into the 
wall.
 
5. Switch on your Base Station.
 
6. Run the installation software provided by Apple on your laptop.
Using non-Apple base stations
If any company other than Apple manufactured your wireless base station, 
the installation procedure is almost certainly the same. (Naturally, you 
should take a gander at the manufacturer’s installation guide just to make 
sure, but I added many different brands of these devices and used the same 
steps for each one.)
However, I should note that Apple wireless hardware uses a slightly different 
security encryption standard than most PC wireless hardware, which results 
in an extra hurdle to connecting to a non-Apple base station or access point 
with your laptop. (More on this in the next section. For now, just remember 
that I recommend using Apple wireless hardware with your MacBook when-
ever possible. It’s just a little easier!)
Joining a wireless network 
As far as I’m concerned, the only two types of base stations on the planet are 
Apple and non-Apple (which includes all 802.11n and 802.11g Base Stations 
and access points). In these two sections, I relate what you need to know to 
get onboard using either type of hardware.
Apple AirPort Base Stations
To join a wireless network that’s served by any flavor of Apple Base Station, 
follow these steps on each Mac with wireless support:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Network icon.
 
3. From the Connection list on the left, click AirPort.
 
4. Mark the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.

290
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
5. Click the Apply button.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
7. Click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan) on the Finder 
menu bar.
 
8. From the AirPort menu, choose an existing network connection that 
you’d like to join.
 
 The network name is the same as the network name you chose when 
you set up your AirPort Base Station.
 
9. If you set up a secure network, enter the password you assigned to the 
network during setup.
By the way, security is always A Good Thing, and I strongly recommend that 
you enable the password encryption features of your Apple base station 
while installing it! (Luckily, the Apple Base Station setup application leads 
you through this very process.) In the words of an important Mark’s Maxim:
 
Keep uninvited guests out of your network! Use your base station’s security 
features and encrypt your data!™
Some wireless networks might not appear in your AirPort menu list. These 
are closed networks, which can be specified when you set up your AirPort 
Base Station. You can’t join a closed network unless you know the exact net-
work name (which is far more secure than simply broadcasting the network 
name). To join a closed network, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Join Other Network from the AirPort menu.
 
 To open the menu, click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan) 
on the Finder menu bar.
 
2. Type the name of the network.
 
3. If the network is secured with WEP or LEAP encryption — the two 
most popular security standards for protecting your data through 
encryption — click the Security pop-up menu and choose which type 
of encryption is being used.
 
4. Enter the network password, if required.
To disconnect from an AirPort network, click the AirPort menu and either
 
 Choose Turn AirPort Off.
 
 Connect to another AirPort network.
 
 In other words, if you choose another available AirPort network from 
the AirPort menu, your MacBook will automatically drop the previous 
connection. (You can only be connected to one wireless network at a 
time, which makes Good Sense.)

291
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
Using non-Apple Base Stations
If you’re using your MacBook to connect to a non-Apple Base Station at your 
office, you might need to follow a specific procedure that takes care of the 
slightly different password functionality used by standard 802.11b/g/n 
hardware.
Leopard can take care of many potential wireless “language barriers” 
caused by security encryption — the two most common forms are WEP and 
LEAP — so whether you need to massage your password to connect to your 
non-Apple base station depends on the specific hardware and encryption 
system that it uses.
To read or print the latest version of this procedure, fire up Safari and visit 
http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.html, searching for the number 
106250. (This is the Apple Knowledge Base article number, which you can 
type in the first search field.) This article provides the details on how to con-
vert a standard wireless encrypted password to a format that your AirPort 
Extreme hardware can understand.
Wired connections
If you’re installing a wired network, your MacBook or MacBook Pro already 
comes with most of what you need for joining your new cabled world. You 
just connect the hardware and configure the connection. Don’t forget that 
you also need cables and an inexpensive Ethernet switch. (If you’re using an 
Internet router or other hardware sharing device, it almost certainly has a 
built-in 4- or 8-port switch.)
Another aside to owners of MacBook Air laptops: Your machine doesn’t come 
from Apple with a wired Ethernet port onboard, but you can buy a USB-to-
Ethernet connector that will allow you to use a wired network. After you add 
the connector to your system, you can follow along without any problem.
Connecting a MacBook or MacBook Pro to a wired network
Your Ethernet 10/100/1000 port (which looks like a slightly oversized modem 
port) is located on one of the sides of your MacBook or MacBook Pro, ready 
to accept a standard Ethernet Cat5/Cat5E/Cat6 cable with RJ-45 connectors. 
If you’re connecting to an existing wired network, you need a standard Cat5/
Cat5E/Cat6 Ethernet cable of the necessary length. I recommend a length of 
no more than 25 feet because cables longer than 25 feet are often subject to 
line interference (which can slow down or even cripple your connection). 
You’ll also need a live Ethernet port from the network near your laptop. Plug 
the cable into your MacBook, and then plug the other end into the network 
port.

Wired network hardware
If you don’t know your switch from your NIC, don’t worry. Here, I provide you 
with a description of the hardware that you need for your wired network.
Wired network components
If you’re building your own wired network, you need
 
 A switch: This gizmo’s job is to provide more network ports for the 
other computers in your network. They typically come in 4- and 8-port 
configurations.
 
 As I mention earlier in this chapter, most Internet routers (sometimes 
called Internet-sharing devices) include a built-in switch, so if you’ve 
already invested in an Internet router, make doggone sure that it doesn’t 
come equipped with the ports you need before you go shopping for a 
switch!
 
 A number of Ethernet cables: Exactly how many cables you need is 
determined by how many computers you’re connecting. If you’re work-
ing with a gigabit Ethernet system, you need Cat5E or Cat6 cables. Cat6 
cables provide better performance, but they are more expensive.
 
Naturally, if you’re using a broadband Internet connection, you’ll also have 
a DSL or cable modem. These boxes always include a port for connecting to 
your wired Ethernet network. (If you have one of the new breed of wireless 
modems — which acts as a wireless base station — don’t panic, for it should 
also have a wired port for connecting to your existing switch.)
Wired network connections
After you assemble your cables and your router or switch, connect the 
Ethernet cables from each of your computers to the router or switch, and 
then turn on the device. (Most need AC power to work.) Check the manual 
that comes with your device to make sure that the lights you’re seeing on the 
front indicate normal operation. (Colors vary by manufacturer, but green is 
usually good.)
Next, connect your cable or DSL modem’s Ethernet port to the WAN port on 
your switch with an Ethernet cable. If your modem isn’t already on, turn it on 
now and check for normal operation.
When your router or switch is powered on and operating normally, you’re 
ready to configure Mac OS X for network operation. Just hop to the upcom-
ing section, “Connecting to the Network.” (How about that? Now you can add 
network technician to your rapidly growing computer résumé!)

 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
Joining a wired Ethernet network
After all the cables are connected and your central connection gizmo is 
plugged in and turned on, you’ve essentially created the hardware portion of 
your network. Congratulations! (Now you need a beard and suspenders.)
With the hardware in place, it’s time to configure Leopard. In this section, I 
assume that you’re connecting to a network with an Internet router or switch 
that includes a DHCP server. (Jump to the sidebar, “The little abbreviation 
that definitely could,” for more on DHCP.)
Follow these steps on each Mac running Mac OS X that you want to connect 
to the network:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Network icon (under Internet & Network).
 
3. From the Connection list on the left, click Ethernet.
 
4. Click the Configure pop-up menu (see Figure 17-2) and choose Using 
DHCP.
 
Figure 17-2: 
All hail 
DHCP, the 
magical 
networking 
fairy!
 
 
5. Click the Apply button.
 
 The Apply button in the figure is grayed out because I’m already 
connected.
 
 Enjoy the automatic goodness as Mac OS X connects to the DHCP server 
to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address, and 
a Domain Name System (DNS) address. (Without a DHCP server, you’d 
have to add all this stuff manually. Ugh.)

294
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
 A few seconds after clicking the Apply button, you should see the infor-
mation come up. You might also notice that the DNS Server field is 
empty, but fear not because Mac OS X is really using DNS Server 
information provided by the DHCP server.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
 You’re on!
Connecting to the Network
All right! The hardware is powered up, the cables (if any) are installed and 
connected, and you configured Leopard. You’re ready to start (or join) the 
party. In this section, I show you how to verify that you’re connected as well 
as how to share data and devices with others on your network.
The little abbreviation that definitely could
You know, some technologies are just peachy. 
(So much for my uber-tech image.) Anyway, 
these well-designed technologies work 
instantly, you don’t have to fling settings around 
like wrapping paper on Christmas day, and 
every computer on the planet can use them: 
Mac, Windows, Linux, and even the laptops 
used by funny-looking folks from Roswell, New 
Mexico.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP 
for short, is about as peachy as it gets. This pro-
tocol enables a computer to automatically get all 
the technical information necessary to join a net-
work. Let me hear you say, “Oh yeah!” Just about 
every network device on the planet can use 
DHCP these days, including Internet routers, 
hubs, switches, and (go figure) Mac OS X. Today’s 
networking hardware and operating systems 
provide a DHCP server, which flings the proper 
settings at every computer on the network all by 
itself. Your Mac just accepts the settings and 
relaxes in a placid networking nirvana.
In this book, you can bet the farm that I assume 
you want to use DHCP and that your network 
hardware supports it as well. That way, I won’t 
spend 30 pages of this book leading you through 
the twisting alleyways of manual network set-
tings. (If you’re really into such things, I spend 
those 30 pages and explain every single techno-
wizard detail in my book Mac OS X Leopard All-
in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, [Wiley]. 
It’s about 800 pages long — hence the compre-
hensive angle.)
If you’re connecting to an existing network, tell 
the network administrator that you’re taking 
the easy route and using DHCP. One word of 
warning, however: Adding more than one DHCP 
server on a single network causes a civil war, 
and your system will lock up tight. Therefore, 
before adding hardware with a DHCP server to 
an existing network, ask that network admin-
istrator to make sure that you aren’t making a 
mistake.

 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
Verifying that the contraption works
After you have at least two computers on a wired or wireless network, test 
whether they’re talking to each other over the network by pinging them. (No, 
I didn’t make up the term, honest.) Essentially, pinging another computer is 
like yelling, “Are you there?” across a crevasse.
To ping another computer on the same network from any Mac running 
Leopard, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
 
3. Click the Ping tab; see upcoming Figure 17-3.
 
4. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the IP 
address of the computer that you want to ping.
 
 If you’re pinging another Mac running Mac OS X, you can get the IP 
address of that machine by simply displaying its Network pane within 
System Preferences, which always displays the IP address.
 
 If you’re trying to ping a PC running Windows and you don’t know the IP 
address of that machine, follow these steps:
 
a. Click Start, right-click My Network Places (XP)/Network (Vista), and 
then choose Properties.
 
b. From the Network Connections window, right-click your Local Area 
Network connection icon and then choose Status from the menu that 
appears.
 
c. Click the Support tab.
 
 The IP address of that PC is proudly displayed.
 
5. Select the Send Only x Pings radio button and enter 5 in the text field.
 
6. Click the Ping button.
 
• Yay!: If everything is working, you should see results similar to 
those shown in Figure 17-3, in which I’m pinging my Windows 
server at IP address 192.168.1.103, across my wired Ethernet 
network.
 
 The address 192.168.1.xxx is a common series of local network IP 
addresses provided by Internet routers, hubs, and switches with 
DHCP servers, so don’t freak if you have the same local IP address.
 
• Nay: If you don’t get a successful ping, check your cable connec-
tions, power cords, and Mac OS X settings. Folks using a wireless 
connection might have to move closer to the network base station 
to connect successfully, especially through walls.

Sharing stuff nicely with others
It works . . . by golly, it works! Okay, now what do you do with your all-new 
shining chrome network connection? Ah, my friend, let me be the first to con-
gratulate you, and the first to show you around! In this section, I cover the 
most popular network perks. (And the good news is that these perks work 
with both wired and wireless connections.)
Network Internet connections
If your DSL or cable modem plugs directly into your MacBook (rather than a 
dedicated Internet sharing device or Internet router), you might ponder just 
how the other computers on your network can share that spiffy high-speed 
broadband connection. If you’re running a wireless network, it comes to the 
rescue!
Follow these steps to share your connection wirelessly:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon (under Internet & Network).
 
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry in the Services list to the left of the 
pane.
 
4. From the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, choose Ethernet.
 
5. Mark the AirPort check box (in the To Computers Using list).
 
 Leopard displays a warning dialog stating that connection sharing could 
affect your Internet service provider (ISP) or violate your agreement 

297
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
with your ISP. I’ve never heard of this actually happening, but if you 
want to be sure, contact your ISP and ask the good folks there.
 
6. Click Start in the warning dialog to continue.
 
7. Select the On check box next to the Internet Sharing entry in the 
Services list.
 
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
 
Sharing an Internet connection (without an Internet router or dedicated hard-
ware device) through Mac OS X requires your computer to remain on continu-
ously. Remind others in your office or your home that the svelte laptop must 
remain on, or they’ll lose their Internet connection! Naturally, when you take 
off on your next trip with your road warrior, the folks left at your home or 
office will be without an Internet connection until you return. 
 
If your MacBook has an external USB modem, you can indeed share a dialup 
modem Internet connection. Just don’t be too surprised if you quickly decide 
to shelve the idea. Those dinosaurs are s-l-o-w beyond belief.
Don’t forget, you won’t need to configure Internet sharing if your DSL or 
cable modem connects to a dedicated sharing device or router. That snazzy 
equipment automatically connects your entire network to the Internet.
Network file sharing
You can swap all sorts of interesting files with other Macintosh computers on 
your network. When you turn on Personal File Sharing, Leopard lets all Macs 
on the network connect to your MacBook and share the files in your Public 
folder. (Note that sharing across a network is different from sharing a single 
computer betwixt several people. I cover that environment in Chapter 16.)
Follow these steps to start sharing files and folders with others across your 
network:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing service entry to 
enable the connections for Mac and Windows sharing.
 
 Other Mac users can connect to your computer by clicking Go in the 
Finder menu and choosing the Network menu item. The Network 

298
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
window appears, and your laptop is among the choices. If the other 
Macs are running Leopard, your MacBook’s shared files and folders 
appear in a Finder window, and they’re listed under the Shared heading 
in the Sidebar.
 
 Windows XP users should be able to connect to your Mac from their My 
Network Places window, and Vista users can use the Network window. 
(Users of pre-XP versions of Windows, head to Network Neighborhood.) 
Those lucky Windows folks also get to print to any shared printers 
you’ve set up. (The following section covers shared printers.)
 
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
 
Leopard conveniently reminds you of the network name for your MacBook at 
the bottom of the Sharing pane.
Sharing a network printer
Boy, howdy, do I love describing easy procedures, and sharing a printer on a 
Mac network ranks high on the list! You can share a printer that’s connected 
to your laptop (or your AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or AirPort Express 
Base Station) by following these very simple steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
 
4. Select the printer you want to share from the list at the right of the 
System Preferences window.
 
5. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
A printer that you share automatically appears in the Print dialog on other 
computers connected to your network.
USE YOUR FIREWALL!
Yep. That’s the only heading in this entire book that’s all uppercase. It’s that 
important.
The following Mark’s Maxim, good reader, isn’t a request, a strong recom-
mendation, or even a regular Maxim. Consider it an absolute commandment 
(right up there with Get an antivirus application now).
 
Turn on your firewall now.™

299
 Chapter 17: Working Well with Networks
When you connect a network to the Internet, you open a door to the outside 
world. As a consultant to several businesses and organizations in my home-
town, I can tell you that the outside world is chock-full of malicious individu-
als who would dearly love to inflict damage on your data or take control of 
your MacBook for their own purposes. Call ’em hackers, call ’em delinquents, 
or call ’em something I can’t repeat, but don’t let them in!
Leopard comes to the rescue again with the built-in firewall within Mac OS X. 
When you use this, you essentially build a virtual brick wall between you and 
the hackers out there (both on the Internet, and even within your local net-
work). Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Select the Allow Only Essential Services radio button to activate your 
firewall.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
6. Select the Enable Stealth Mode check box.
 
 This is an important feature that prevents hackers from “trolling” for 
your MacBook on the Internet — or, in normal-speak, searching for an 
unprotected computer — so it’s much harder for them to attack you.
 
7. Click OK.
 
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
Leopard even keeps track of the Internet traffic that you do want to reach 
your laptop, such as Web page requests and file sharing. When you activate 
one of the network features that I demonstrate in the preceding section, 
Leopard automatically opens a tiny hole (called a port by net-types) in your 
firewall to allow just that type of communication to your Mac.
For example, if you decide to turn on Web Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier), 
Leopard automatically allows incoming Web access.
You can also add ports for applications that aren’t on the firewall’s Allow list. 
This includes third-party Instant Messaging clients, multiplayer game servers, 
and the like. Depending on the type of connection, Leopard will often auto-
matically display a dialog prompting you for confirmation before allowing 
certain traffic, so most folks won’t need to do anything manually.

300
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
However, you can add a program manually to your list of allowed (or blocked) 
Firewall ports. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Click the Add button.
 
 Leopard displays a standard File browsing sheet.
 
5. Browse to the application that requires access to the outside world — or 
the application that you want to block from outside communication — 
and click it to select it.
 
6. Click the Add button in the File sheet.
 
 The application appears in the Firewall list. By default, it’s set to Allow 
Incoming Connections.
 
7. If you want to block any incoming communication to the application, 
click the Allow Incoming Connections pop-up menu and choose Block 
Incoming Connections instead.

ime to talk cordless. Your MacBook is already pretty doggone all-inclusive 
because everything that most other computers string together with 
cords has been integrated into the laptop’s case, including the monitor and 
speakers. Depending on the connection options that you choose when you 
buy your laptop (or what you added since), the only cord that you absolutely 
need might be your AC power cord.
For most of us, this introduces an entirely new realm of possibilities . . . and 
that results in more questions. Exactly how do other wireless devices com-
municate with your MacBook? Can you really share the data on your laptop 
with your cellphone? Can you sit in the comfort of your overstuffed recliner 
and watch a DVD from 15 feet away?
In this chapter, I describe to you what’s cooking in the world of wireless 
devices. I won’t delve into wireless Ethernet networking between your 
MacBook and other computers; that’s covered in depth in the confines of 
Chapter 17. I also don’t discuss the Apple Remote in this chapter; that’s cov-
ered in Chapter 10. However, I do cover the wireless Bluetooth connections 
that you can make with devices other than computers.

Bluetooth: What a Silly Name 
for Such Cool Technology
Originally, wireless computer connections were limited to IR (infrared) and 
802.11b (the original Wi-Fi specification for wireless Ethernet networks). This 
was fine; after all, what were you gonna connect to your Mac besides other 
computers? Ah, but progress marches on.
A little Danish history
Enter the explosion in popularity of modern cellphones and personal digi-
tal assistants (PDAs). In 1998, a consortium of big-name cellphone, PDA, 
and computer laptop manufacturers decided that their products needed 
a method of communicating with each other. This new wireless standard 
needed to be inexpensive and consume as little battery power as possible, so 
designers decided to keep the operational distance limited to a maximum of 
about 30 feet. Plus, the idea was to keep this new wireless system as hassle-
free as possible: Everyone agreed that you should simply be able to walk 
within range of another device, and the two would link up immediately and 
automatically. Thus, Bluetooth was born!
 
 Bluetooth has been incorporated into a range of peripherals and devices, 
including
 
 Cellphones
 
 Laptops
 
 Wireless computer peripherals, such as keyboards and mice
 
 Printers
 
 Headphones
Is your MacBook Bluetooth-ready?
Danish royalty aside, you still need to know whether your MacBook is ready 
for a Bluetooth connection. At the time of this writing, all Apple laptops come 
with internal Bluetooth hardware. If you’re using an older Mac laptop without 
Bluetooth built in, though, you’re currently out of the Bluetooth loop.

303
 Chapter 18: Communicating with That Bluetooth Guy
However, you don’t need to pitch your faithful MacBook if it doesn’t yet talk 
to the pirate! You can add Bluetooth capability to your computer with a 
simple USB Bluetooth adapter. The USB Bluetooth adapter from Belkin (www.
belkin.com) sells online for about $30. It includes automatic data encryp-
tion, which is necessary only if there’s a hacker within about 30 to 60 feet of 
your computer (although more security is always better in my book). The 
adaptor can link with up to seven other Bluetooth devices simultaneously. 
(Come to think of it, there were a lot of people within 30 feet of my MacBook 
Pro during my last LAN party bash. I guess this stuff really is important!)
Leopard and Bluetooth, together forever
You’d expect a modern, high-tech operating system like Mac OS X to come 
with Bluetooth drivers. You’d be right, but Apple goes a step further: 
Leopard comes with System Preferences and a utility application to help you 
get your laptop connected with the Bluetooth devices that are likely hanging 
out in your coat pockets.
Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock. From the Bluetooth pane, 
you can
 
 Set up new Bluetooth devices. Click the Set Up New Device button to 
run the Bluetooth Setup Assistant, which configures Bluetooth devices 
for use with Leopard.
 
 Follow the device-specific onscreen instructions to set up a number of 
common Bluetooth toys (including keyboards, mice, cellphones, and 
printers), or you can work with other types of devices by choosing 
Other. Setup Assistant searches for your Bluetooth device and makes 
sure that it’s ready to party with your MacBook.
 
 
Make sure that your Bluetooth device is in range and discoverable (avail-
able for connections with other Bluetooth devices) before you run the 
Bluetooth Setup Assistant. Check your user manual to determine how to 
set your Bluetooth device as “discoverable,” and make sure that you’re 
about 20 feet away (or less) from your MacBook.
 
 Configure Bluetooth connections. Click the Advanced button to create, 
remove, enable, or disable your Bluetooth connections, using them as 
virtual serial ports (for the simple transfer of data) or virtual modems 
(for bidirectional transfers, such as using an Internet connection 
through a Bluetooth cellphone).
 
 These openings to the outside world are presented as individual connec-
tions in the Serial Port list, and you can toggle them on and off individu-
ally. You can also specify whether a Bluetooth port is encrypted. 
Figure 18-1 shows an active Bluetooth virtual modem that’s set up 
to allow my MacBook Pro to sync up with my Palm Pilot, using the 
Bluetooth-PDA-Sync service.

304
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
I recommend that you enable the Show Bluetooth Status in the Menu Bar 
check box. The Bluetooth menu lets you conserve power by turning off your 
Bluetooth hardware until you need it. You can also conveniently toggle your 
laptop’s discovery status as well as set up a device or send and browse files. 
(You can even see what devices are connected to your Mac with the click of a 
menu icon. ’Nuff said.)
 
Figure 18-1: 
You can 
add, delete, 
enable or 
disable 
Bluetooth 
ports 
from the 
Advanced 
sheet.
 
 
If you know you won’t be using Bluetooth devices while you’re on the road, 
disabling a Bluetooth service on a laptop can help conserve battery power.
The other Bluetooth resource that you can use is the standalone application 
Bluetooth File Exchange. (Yes, you can call it BFE if you like. I do whenever 
possible.) You have to launch BFE the old-fashioned way; it’s located in 
your Utilities folder, inside your Applications folder. Much like a traditional 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) application, double-clicking the Bluetooth File 
Exchange icon presents you with a file selection dialog, where you choose 
the file(s) you want to send to the connected Bluetooth device! You can also 
elect to browse the files on a networked Bluetooth device so that you can see 
what the owner of that device is offering.
You can also set up your defaults for file exchanges from the Sharing pane 
in System Preferences. Click the Sharing icon and then select the Bluetooth 
Sharing check box to display the settings shown in Figure 18-2. Here you can 
control what Leopard does when you receive files or Personal Information 
Manager (PIM) data with BFE. For instance, with these settings, Leopard can

305
 Chapter 18: Communicating with That Bluetooth Guy
 
 Prompt you for permission to receive each file or PIM item
 
 Accept all files and PIM items without restriction or prompting
 
 Save all incoming files and items to the folder that you specify
 
 Offer only the files and items in the folder that you specify when other 
Bluetooth items browse your MacBook
 
Figure 18-2: 
Configure 
file 
exchanges 
in System 
Prefer-
ences.
 
Personally, I’m all for the defaults in Leopard for file exchanges:
 
 I want to know when someone’s sending me something.
 
 I want anything I receive to be saved in my Downloads folder.
 
 If I turn on File Transfer, I want to allow others to browse the contents of 
my Public folder.
However, feel free to adjust, enable, and disable to your heart’s content.
Adding Wireless Keyboards 
and Mice to Your Laptop
The current crop of Mac laptops arrive at your doorstep in a fully wireless 
configuration: Apple throws in an internal Bluetooth adapter and an inter-
nal AirPort Extreme wireless card. Everything’s already included for you. 

306
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
Therefore, you can indeed work keyboard and mouse magic from across the 
room from your laptop, using a wireless keyboard and mouse that you can 
buy separately. (Or perhaps you just want a full-size keyboard and external 
mouse to use when you’re working from your home or office.)
A number of wireless Bluetooth keyboard/mouse packages are on the market, 
and any one of ’em should work fine with your Mac. In fact, you can buy 
Apple’s wireless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse separately, for a total of 
about $150. Other offerings from Logitech and our old buddy Microsoft run 
about the same amount.
When shopping for a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse desktop, keep these facts in 
mind:
 
 Some keyboards are created more than equal. Many of today’s third-
party keyboards are encrusted with extra function buttons that do 
everything from opening your e-mail application to searching your 
kitchen cabinets for another can of spray cheese.
 
 I like these programmable function keys — they can bring up your favor-
ite applications with a single keystroke while you’re relaxing 20 feet 
away — so look for the keyboard that offers the most programmable 
keys in your price range.
 
 Rodents crave energy. Does the wireless mouse come with its own 
recharging stand? If so, that’s a big plus. Depending on how much you 
use your laptop, a mouse that runs on standard batteries can go through 
a set in as little as a month’s time! (Not surprisingly, many computer 
owners use rechargeable batteries in their wireless mice.) In fact, some 
wireless mice include an on/off switch to help conserve battery power.
 
 Wireless doesn’t always mean Bluetooth. Just because a keyboard or 
mouse is wireless doesn’t automatically make it a Bluetooth device. 
Plenty of wireless RF (radio frequency) devices are out there, too. These 
toys need their own transmitters, which are usually USB-based as well, 
so things can get confusing. Therefore, read the box or technical specifi-
cations carefully to make sure you’re buying Bluetooth.
 
 Bluetooth stuff isn’t self-cleaning. Sure, your new wireless keyboard 
and mouse can hang out with you on the sofa, but that doesn’t mean 
they’re happy sharing your nacho puffs and grape soda. Look for an 
optical mouse that doesn’t use a ball, and check whether a prospective 
keyboard can be easily cleaned and maintained before you buy it.
Most Bluetooth devices are controlled through the Bluetooth pane in System 
Preferences. However, wireless keyboards and mice are a special case because 
they’re monitored through the Bluetooth section of the Keyboard & Mouse 
pane. (You can even add a new wireless device from this tab. Geez, those 
Apple designers give you a dozen roads to the same spot on the map, don’t 
they?)

Getting Everything in iSync
No jokes about boy bands, please. iSync is the data transfer and synchroniz-
ing utility application that ships with Leopard, and it works fine with both 
wired and wireless Bluetooth connections. The difference between Bluetooth 
File Exchange and iSync is a matter of intelligence:
 
 BFE merely transfers files and dumps them in the folders you specify.
 
 iSync copies and updates your Address Book, Safari, and iCal informa-
tion between devices. iSync compares the information on both your 
laptop and your devices and makes sure they end up the same.
 
 iSync also allows you to synchronize data between multiple computers 
by using your .Mac membership so that the contacts, bookmarks, and 
calendar data on your MacBook match the data on your Mac Pro. You 
can control what gets sent from the .Mac pane in System Preferences. 
(For more on .Mac, visit Chapter 9.)
 
Just because your phone or PDA supports Bluetooth doesn’t mean that iSync 
is guaranteed to work. I know a few Mac owners who are still seething over 
incompatible devices. For a complete list of the Bluetooth phones, PDAs, and 
other devices that work with iSync, visit www.apple.com/isync/devices.
html.
After your supported Bluetooth device is linked to your Mac, follow these 
steps to add the new device to iSync and synchronize your data:
 
1. Click the Finder icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click Applications in the Finder window Sidebar and double-click 
iSync.
 
3. Press Ô+N.
 
 iSync displays the Add Device dialog.
 
4. Click Scan to display any Bluetooth devices in range.
 
5. Double-click the device that you want to use.
 
 The window expands to allow you to specify what data is to be synchro-
nized. (Other settings might appear as well, depending on the device.)
 
6. Mark the check boxes for each data type that you want to exchange.
 
7. Click Sync Devices.
 
Never disconnect a device while a synchronization is in progress. You risk cor-
rupting the data being transferred, or your MacBook could lock up. Wait until 
iSync indicates that the synchronization is finished; the application displays a 
message when the process is complete.

308
Part V: Sharing Access and Information 
 
Deleting a calendar event or a contact on either your laptop or the Bluetooth 
device deletes that same data from the other machine! For example, if you 
decide you no longer need your personal contacts on your Mac at work and 
you delete ’em, they’ll be deleted from your PDA when you synchronize. When I 
say that iSync creates a mirror image on both sides of the connection, I’m not 
lying: Additions appear, and deletions disappear.
The Magic of Wireless Printing
To your Mac laptop, a wireless Bluetooth printer is just another Bluetooth 
connection — but to you, it’s the very definition of convenience, especially if 
desk space is limited next to your Mac. Just set that paper-producing puppy 
up anywhere in the 30–40 foot range, plug it in, set up the printer in Leopard, 
and let ’er rip.
 
Not all printer manufacturers produce Bluetooth models that communicate 
properly with your Mac. Make sure that the Bluetooth printer you buy sup-
ports HCRP. (Another jawbreaker acronym. This time it stands for Hardcopy 
Cable Replacement Protocol.)
You have two options when installing a Bluetooth printer:
 
 Whenever possible, use the printer manufacturer’s software. A printer 
might require a driver that a typical Bluetooth device doesn’t need. 
 
 You can usually successfully set up a printer via the Bluetooth Setup 
Assistant, which you can run from Bluetooth pane of System Preferences 
(as I discuss earlier in the chapter):
 
a. Make sure your printer is set as discoverable.
 
 Check your printer manual to determine how to switch your 
printer to discoverable mode. This mode allows other Bluetooth 
devices within range (including your laptop) to recognize and 
make a connection to your printer.
 
b. Click the Set Up New Device button.
 
c. Choose to install a printer.
 
d. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Luckily, after you successfully set up a Bluetooth printer, you can just press 
Ô+P to open the Print dialog box and choose that printer from the Printer 
pop-up menu. No big whoop . . . and that’s the way it should be.

In This Chapter
 Avoiding the blame (righteously)
 Putting basic troubleshooting precepts to work
 Using Mark’s Troubleshooting Tree
 Getting help
I
 wish you weren’t reading this chapter.
Because you are, I can only surmise that you’re having trouble with your 
MacBook, and that it needs fixing. (The other possibility — that you just like 
reading about solving computer problems — is more attractive, but much 
more problematic.)
Consider this chapter a crash course in the logical puzzle that is computer 
troubleshooting: namely, the art of finding out What Needs Fixing. You also 
see what you can do when you just plain can’t fix the problem by yourself.
Oh, and you’re going to encounter a lot of Tips and Mark’s Maxims in this 
chapter — all of them learned the hard way, so I recommend committing 
them to memory on the spot!
Repeat After Me: Yes, I Am a Tech!
Anyone can troubleshoot. Put these common troubleshooting myths to rest:
 
 It takes a college degree in computer science to troubleshoot. Tell 
that to my troubleshooting kids in junior high. They’ll think it’s a hoot 
because they have Apple computers of their own in the classroom. You 
can follow all the steps in this chapter without any special training.
 
 I’m to blame. Ever heard of viruses? Failing hardware? Buggy software? 
Any of those things can be causing the problem. It’s Mark’s Maxim time.

312
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
 Don’t beat yourself up! Your laptop can be fixed.™
 
 I need to buy expensive utility software. Nope. You can certainly 
invest in a commercial testing and repair utility if you like. My favorite is 
TechTool Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.com), but a third-party 
utility isn’t a requirement for troubleshooting. (I would, however, con-
sider an antivirus application as a must-have, and you should have one 
already. Hint, hint.)
 
 There’s no hope if I can’t fix it. Sure, parts fail, and computers crash, 
but your Apple Service Center can repair just about any problem. And 
(ahem) if you backed up your laptop (like I preach throughout this 
book), you’ll keep that important data (even if a new hard drive is in 
your future).
 
 It takes forever. Wait until you read the Number One Rule in the next 
section; the first step takes but 30 seconds and often solves the prob-
lem. Naturally, not all problems can be fixed so quickly, but if you follow 
the procedures in this chapter, you should fix your laptop (or at least 
know that the problem requires outside help) in a single afternoon.
With those myths banished for good, you can get down to business and start 
feeling better soon.
Step-by-Step Laptop Troubleshooting
In this section, I walk you through my Should-Be-Patented Troubleshooting 
Tree as well as the Leopard built-in troubleshooting application, Disk Utility. 
I also introduce you to a number of keystrokes that can make your MacBook 
jump through hoops.
The Number One Rule: Reboot!
Yep, it sounds silly, but the fact is that rebooting your MacBook can often 
solve a number of problems. If you’re encountering these types of strange 
behavior with your laptop, a reboot might be all you need to heal
 
 Intermittent problems communicating over a network
 
 A garbled screen, strange colors, or screwed-up fonts
 
 The Swirling Beach Ball of Doom that won’t go away after several 
minutes

313
 Chapter 19: When Good Mac Laptops Go Bad
 
 An application that locks up
 
 An external device that seems to disappear or can’t be opened
To put it succinctly, here’s a modest Mark’s Maxim:
 
Always try a reboot before beginning to worry. Always.™
 
If you’re in the middle of a document, try to save all your open documents 
before you reboot. That might not be possible, but try to save what you can.
If you need to force a locked application (one that’s not responding) to quit 
so you can reboot, follow these steps to squash that locked application:
 
1. Click the Apple (Ú) menu and choose Force Quit.
 
 The dialog that you see in Figure 19-1 appears on your screen.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Force a 
recalcitrant 
application 
to take off.
 
Why is rebooting so darned effective?
Rebooting fixes problems because it resets 
everything. Your network connection, for exam-
ple, might be acting up or have timed out, and 
rebooting restores it. Rebooting also fixes prob-
lems due to brownouts or those notorious AC 
power flickerings that we all notice from time to 
time, which can even affect a laptop running on 
an AC adapter. Such interruptions in constant 
juice might not bother you or me (or your less-
intelligent toaster), but they can play tricks on 
your laptop that rebooting will fix.

314
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
2. Click the offending application and then click the Force Quit button.
When you get everything to quit, you should be able to click the Apple menu 
and choose Shut Down (not Restart) without a problem.
If your MacBook simply won’t shut down (or you can’t get the offending 
application to quit), then do what must be done:
 
1. Press and hold your laptop’s Power button until it shuts itself off.
 
 You have to wait about five seconds for your MacBook to turn itself off.
 
2. Wait about ten seconds.
 
3. Press the Power button again to restart the computer.
After everything is back up, check whether the problem is still apparent. If 
you use your laptop for an hour or two and the problem doesn’t reoccur, you 
likely fixed it!
Special keys that can come in handy
A number of keys have special powers over your MacBook. No, I’m not kid-
ding! These keys affect how your road warrior starts up, and they can really 
come in handy whilst troubleshooting.
Using Safe Boot mode
You can use Safe Boot mode to force Leopard to run a directory check of 
your boot hard drive and disable any Login Items that might be interfering 
with Leopard. Use the Shut Down menu item from the Apple (Ú) menu to 
completely turn off your laptop, press the Power button to start the com-
puter, and then press and hold down the Shift key immediately after you 
hear the startup tone. After Leopard completely boots, restart your MacBook 
again (this time without the Shift key) to return to normal operation.
Startup keys
Table 19-1 provides the lowdown on startup keys. Hold the indicated key 
down either when you push your Power button or immediately after the screen 
blanks during a restart. (As I just mentioned, the Shift key is the exception; it 
should be pressed and held down after you hear the startup tone.)

cian. I’ll warrant that you’ll use at least the C startup key fairly often.
All hail Disk Utility, the 
troubleshooter’s friend
Leopard’s Disk Utility is a handy tool for troubleshooting and repairing your 
hard drive. You can find it in the Utilities folder within your Applications 
folder.
Danger, Will Robinson!
Many Disk Utility functions can actually wipe 
your hard drives clean of data instead of repair-
ing them! These advanced functions aren’t 
likely to help you with troubleshooting a prob-
lem with your existing volumes anyway.
Remember: Don’t use these Disk Utility func-
tions unless an Apple technician tells you to 
use them:
  Partitioning and erasing drives
  Setting up RAID arrays
  Restoring files from disk images

316
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Fire up Disk Utility and click the First Aid tab to bring up the rather powerful-
looking window shown in Figure 19-2.
In the left column of the Disk Utility window, you can see
 
 The physical hard drives in your system (the actual hardware)
 
 The volumes (the data stored on the hard drives)
 
 You can always tell a volume because it’s indented underneath the phys-
ical drive entry.
 
 Any CD or DVD loaded on your MacBook
 
 USB or FireWire Flash drives
For example, in Figure 19-2, I have one hard drive (the 298.1GB entry) and one 
USB Flash drive (the 3.7GB entry). The hard drive has two volumes (Wolfgang 
and Mother), and the USB drive has one volume (MLC USB).
 
The information at the bottom of the Disk Utility window contains the speci-
fications of the selected drive or volume . . . things like capacity, free space, 
and the number of files and folders for a volume, or connection type and total 
capacity for a drive.

 Chapter 19: When Good Mac Laptops Go Bad
Repairing disk permissions
Because Leopard is built on a Unix base, lots of permissions can apply to 
the files on your drive — that is, who can open (or read or change) every 
application, folder, and document on your hard drive. Unfortunately, these 
permissions are often messed up by wayward applications or power glitches, 
or application installers that do a subpar job of cleaning up after themselves. 
And if the permissions on a file are changed, often applications lock up or 
refuse to run altogether.
 
I recommend repairing your disk permissions with Disk Utility once weekly. 
Figure 19-3 shows a permissions repair sweep on my internal hard drive’s 
volume.
Use these steps to repair permissions on your MacBook’s hard drive:
 
1. Make sure that you’re logged in with an admin account.
 
 Chapter 16 shows you how to log in as an admin user.
 
2. Save and close any open documents.
 
3. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.

cessful 
run, using 
Repair 
Disk Permis-
sions.
 

318
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
4. Click the volume that you want to check.
 
5. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
 
 I don’t worry about verifying. If something’s wrong, you end up clicking 
Repair Disk Permissions, anyway. Just click Repair Disk Permissions; if 
nothing pops up, that’s fine.
 
6. To finish the process, always reboot after repairing permissions.
 
 This shows you whether a problem has been corrected!
Repairing disks
Disk Utility can check the format and health of both hard drives and volumes 
with Verify Disk — and, if the problem can be corrected, fix any error by 
using Repair Disk.
 
Using Disk Utility to repair your hard drive carries a couple of caveats:
 
 You can’t repair the boot disk or the boot volume. This actually makes 
sense because you’re using that disk and volume right now.
 
 To verify or repair your boot hard drive, you need to boot from 
your Mac OS X installation disc by using the C startup key. (Refer to 
Table 19-1 for keys that come in handy.) After your laptop boots from 
the Mac OS X installation disc, choose the Utilities menu and click 
Disk Utility.
 
 You should be able to select your boot hard drive or volume, and the 
Verify Disk and Repair Disk buttons should be enabled.
 
 You can’t repair CDs and DVDs. CDs and DVDs are read-only media and 
thus can’t be repaired at all (at least by Disk Utility).
 
 If your MacBook is having trouble reading a CD or DVD, wipe the disc 
with a soft cloth to remove dust, oil, and fingerprints. Should that fail, 
invest in a disc-cleaning contrivance of some sort.
If you need to verify and repair a disk or volume, follow these steps:
 
1. If you need to repair your boot drive and volume, save all your open 
documents and reboot from either an external drive or your Mac OS X 
Installation disc.
 
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.
 
3. In the list at the left side of the Disk Utility window, click the disk or 
volume that you want to check.
 
4. Click the Repair Disk button.
 
5. If changes were made (or if you had to boot from a disc or external 
drive), reboot after repairing the disk or volume.

 Chapter 19: When Good Mac Laptops Go Bad
Mark’s MacBook Troubleshooting Tree
As the hip-hop artists say, “Alright, kick it.” And that’s just what my MacBook 
Troubleshooting Tree is here for. If rebooting your laptop hasn’t solved the 
problem, follow these steps in order (until either the solution is found, or you 
run out of steps — more on that in the next section).
Step 1: Investigate recent changes
This is a simple step that many novice Mac owners forget. Simply retrace 
your steps and consider what changes you made recently to your system. 
Here are the most common culprits:
 
 Did you just finish installing a new application? Try uninstalling it by 
removing the application directory and any support files that it might 
have added to your system. (And keep your applications current with 
the most recent patches and updates from the developer’s Web site.)
 
 From time to time, an application’s preference file — which stores all 
the custom settings you make — can become corrupted. Although the 
application itself is okay, it might act strangely or refuse to launch. To 
check your preference files for signs of corruption, try scanning your 
applications with Preferential Treatment, a freeware AppleScript utility 
by Jonathan Nathan, available from his Web site at www.jonn8.com/
html/pt.html. (Preferential Treatment will flag any dicey preference 
files, setting them up for a quick trip to the Trash.)
Should I reinstall Mac OS X?
This question seems to get a lot of attention 
on Mac-related Internet discussion boards 
and Usenet newsgroups — and the answer 
is a definitive perhaps. (I know. That’s really 
helpful.)
Here’s the explanation. You shouldn’t lose a 
single byte of data by reinstalling Mac OS X, so 
it’s definitely okay to try it. However, reinstall-
ing Mac OS X isn’t a universal balm that fixes 
all software errors because the problem that 
you’re encountering might be due to a buggy 
application, or a hard drive that’s going critical, 
or a video card with faulty memory modules. If 
the trouble you’re having is because of a cor-
rupted Mac OS X System folder, reinstalling 
Leopard might or might not fix the problem.
Therefore, the debate rages on. I would cer-
tainly follow the MacBook Troubleshooting 
Tree all the way to the end before I would even 
consider reinstalling Leopard, and I would rec-
ommend contacting an Apple support techni-
cian via the Apple Web site before you take 
this step.

320
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
 Did you just apply an update or a patch to an application? Uninstall 
the application and reinstall it without applying the patch. If your 
MacBook suddenly works again, check the developer’s Web site or con-
tact its technical support department to report the problem.
 
 Did you just update Leopard by using Software Update? Updating 
Leopard can introduce problems within your applications that depend 
on specific routines and system files. Contact the developer of the appli-
cation and look for updated patches that bring your software in line with 
the Leopard updates. (And use Software Update in automatic mode to 
check for Mac OS X updates at least once weekly.)
 
 Did you just make a change within System Preferences? Return the 
options that you changed back to their original settings; then consult 
Chapter 6 for information on what might have gone wrong. (If the setting 
in question isn’t in Chapter 6, consider searching Leopard’s online Help 
or the Apple support Web site for more clues.)
 
 Did you just connect (or reconnect) an external device? Try unplugging 
the device and then rebooting to see whether the problem disappears. 
Remember that many peripherals need software drivers to run — and 
without those drivers installed, they won’t work correctly. Check the 
device’s manual or visit the company’s Web site to search for software 
that you might need.
If you didn’t make any significant changes to your system before you encoun-
tered the problem, proceed to the next step.
Step 2: Run Disk Utility
The preceding section shows how to repair disk permissions on your 
Leopard boot drive.
 
If you’re experiencing hard drive problems, consider booting from your Mac 
OS X Installation CD or DVD to run a full-blown Repair Disk checkup on your 
boot volume.
Step 3: Check your cables
Cables work themselves loose, and they fail from time to time. Check all your 
cables to your external devices — make sure that they’re snug — and verify 
that everything’s plugged in and turned on. (Oh, and don’t forget to check for 
crimps in your cables or even Fluffy’s teeth marks.)
 
If a FireWire or USB device acts up, swap cables around to find whether you 
have a bad one. A faulty cable can leave you pulling your hair out in no time.

321
 Chapter 19: When Good Mac Laptops Go Bad
Step 4: Check your Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to see whether you recently deleted files 
or folders by accident. Click the Trash icon on the Dock once to display the 
contents. If something’s been deleted by mistake, drag it back to its original 
folder, and try running the application again.
I know this one from personal experience. A slight miscalculation while 
selecting files to delete made an application freeze every time I launched it.
Step 5: Check your Internet and network connections
Now that always-on DSL and cable modem connections to the Internet are 
common, don’t forget an obvious problem: Your laptop can’t reach the 
Internet because your ISP is down, or your network is no longer working!
A quick visual check of your DSL or cable modem will usually indicate 
whether there’s a connection problem between your modem and your ISP. 
For example, my modem has a very informative activity light that I always 
glance at first. However, if your laptop is connected to the Internet through a 
larger home or office network and you can’t check the modem visually, you 
can check your Internet connection by pinging www.apple.com.
 
1. Open your Utilities folder (inside your Applications folder).
 
2. Double-click Network Utility.
 
3. Click the Ping button.
 
4. Enter www.apple.com in the Address box.
 
5. Click Ping.
 
 You should see successful ping messages. If you don’t get a successful 
ping and you can still reach other computers on your network, your 
cable/DSL modem or your ISP are likely experiencing problems. If you 
can’t reach your network at all, the problem lies in your network hard-
ware or configuration.
Step 6: Think virus
If you made it to this point, it’s time to run a full virus scan — and make sure 
that your antivirus application has the latest updated data files, too. My 
antivirus application of choice is Virus Barrier X from Intego (www.intego.
com).
 
If a virus is detected and your antivirus application can’t remove it, try quar-
antining it instead, which basically disables the virus-ridden application and 
prevents it from infecting other files.

322
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Step 7: Disable your Login Items
Mac OS X might encounter problems with applications that you’ve marked as 
Login Items within System Preferences. In this step, I show you how to iden-
tify login problems and how to fix ’em.
Checking for problems
It’s time to use another nifty startup key (refer to Table 19-1). This time, hold 
down Shift after you hear the startup tone.
This trick disables your account’s Login Items, which are run automatically 
every time you log in to your MacBook. If one of these Login Items is to 
blame, your laptop will simply encounter trouble every time you log in.
Finding the Login Item that’s causing trouble
If your laptop works fine with your Login Items disabled, follow this proce-
dure for each item in the Login Items list:
 
1. Open System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login 
Items button.
 
2. Delete the item from the list; then reboot normally.
 
 You can delete the selected item by clicking the Delete button, which 
bears a minus sign.
 
 When your MacBook starts up normally with Login Items enabled, you 
discovered the perpetrator. You’ll likely need to delete that application 
and reinstall it. (Don’t forget to add each of the working Login Items back 
to the Login Items list!)
Step 8: Turn off your screen saver
This is a long shot, but it isn’t unheard of to discover that a faulty, bug-ridden 
screensaver has locked up your MacBook. (If you aren’t running one of the 
Apple-supplied screensavers and your computer never wakes up from Sleep 
mode or hangs while displaying the screensaver, you found your prime suspect.)
Reboot your MacBook (if necessary), open System Preferences, and then 
click Desktop & Screen Saver, and click the Screen Saver button. Then do one 
of the following:
 
 Switch to an Apple screensaver.
 
 Drag the Start slider to Never.
 
If this fixes the problem, you can typically remove the screensaver completely 
by deleting the offending saver application in the Screen Savers folder inside 
your Mac OS X Library folder. If you can’t find the screensaver application, try 
typing the saver name in the Spotlight search box.

323
 Chapter 19: When Good Mac Laptops Go Bad
Step 9: Run System Profiler
Ouch. You reached Step 9, and you still haven’t uncovered the culprit. At this 
point, you narrowed the possibilities to a serious problem, like bad hardware 
or corrupted files in your Mac OS X System Folder. Fortunately, Leopard pro-
vides System Profiler, which displays real-time information on the hardware 
in your system. Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac; then click 
More Info. Click each one of the Hardware categories in turn, double-check-
ing to make sure that everything looks okay.
 
You don’t have to understand all the technical hieroglyphics. If a Hardware 
category doesn’t return what you expect or displays an error message, 
though, that’s suspicious. (If your MacBook doesn’t have a specific type of 
hardware onboard — including an optical drive or Fibre Channel hardware — 
you won’t get information from those categories.)
 
Diagnostics shows whether your MacBook passed the Power On self-test.
Okay, I Kicked It, and 
It Still Won’t Work
Don’t worry, friendly reader. Just because you’ve reached the end of my 
MacBook tree doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. In this section, I discuss the 
online help available on the Apple Web site as well as local help in your own 
town.
Apple Help Online
If you haven’t visited the Apple MacBook Support site yet, run — don’t walk — 
to www.apple.com/support/macbook, where you can find
 
 The latest patches, updates, and how-to tutorials for the MacBook line
 
 MacBook and Mac OS X discussion boards, moderated by Apple
 
 Tools for ordering spare parts, checking on your remaining warranty 
coverage, and searching the Apple Knowledge Base
 
 Do-it-yourself instructions (PDF files) that you can follow to repair or 
upgrade your MacBook

Local service, at your service
In case you need to take in your MacBook for service, an Apple Store or 
Apple Authorized Service Provider is probably in your area. To find the clos-
est service, launch Safari and visit
http://www.apple.com/buy/locator/service/
That’s the Find Service page on the Apple Web site. You can search by city 
and state or ZIP code. The results are complete with the provider’s mailing 
address, Web site address, telephone number, and even a map of the location!
Always call your Apple service provider before you lug your (albeit light-
weight) laptop all the way to the shop. Make sure that you know your 
MacBook’s serial number (which you can display in System Profiler) and 
which version of Mac OS X you’re using.

Adding New Stuff to Your Laptop
In This Chapter
 Adding memory
 Upgrading your hard drive
 Adding USB and FireWire devices
 Reviewing what add-ons are available
“N
o laptop is an island.” Somebody famous wrote that, I’m sure.
Without getting too philosophical — or invoking the all-powerful Internet yet 
again — the old saying really does make sense. All computer owners usually 
add at least one peripheral (external device), such as a printer, joystick, an 
iPod, a backup drive, or a scanner. I talk about the ports on your MacBook in 
Chapter 1. Those holes aren’t there to just add visual interest to the sides of 
your treasured laptop. Therefore, I cover your USB and FireWire ports (and 
what you can plug into them) in detail in this chapter.
Ah, but what about the stuff inside your road warrior? That’s where things 
get both interesting and scary at the same time. In this chapter, I describe 
what you can add to the innards of your computer as well as how to get 
inside there if you work up the courage to go exploring.
More Memory Will Help
Hey, wait a second. No however stuck on the end? You mean for once, there 
isn’t an exception? Aren’t all computers different? Hard as it is to believe, just 
keep in mind this Mark’s Maxim:
 
More memory helps.™

326
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Period. End of statement. No matter what type of computer you own, how old 
it is, or what operating system you use, adding more memory to your system 
(to the maximum it supports) significantly improves the performance of your 
operating system (and practically every application that you run).
 
Memory maximizes the power of your computer: The more memory you have, 
the less data your laptop has to temporarily store on its hard drive. Without 
getting into virtual memory and other techno-gunk, just consider that extra 
memory as extra elbowroom for your applications and your documents. (You 
can read how in Chapter 21.) Believe me, both Mac OS X and Windows XP/
Vista efficiently make use of every kilobyte of memory that you can provide.
MacBook Air owners, I have good and bad news: The good news is that  your 
laptop is already maxed out at 2GB of memory, and the bad news is that you 
can’t add any more. Your ultrathin Air is a sealed unit — literally — and you 
must visit your local Apple hardware technician if your laptop’s memory 
malfunctions and needs replacing. (The same is true for your Air’s battery.) 
Therefore, you can skip the rest of this section!
Figuring out how much memory you have
To see how much memory you have in your computer, click the Apple menu 
(Ú), choose About This Mac, click More Info, and click the Memory heading.
At the time of this writing, your MacBook or MacBook Pro has sockets for 
two DDR SDRAM memory modules. (Don’t fret over what all the abbrevia-
tions mean. Rest assured that this memory type is fast.) These modules are 
available with up to 2GB of memory, so you can install as much as 4GB of 
memory in your Mac.
How you plan memory upgrades depends on how much memory you want. 
If your MacBook uses the single default 1GB module supplied by Apple, you 
have a couple of options:
 
 Add up to 2GB of RAM by inserting a 1GB or a 2GB memory module in 
the empty slot. At the time of this writing, a gigabyte memory module 
should set you back about $100 or so.
 
 2GB of memory is plenty for running applications from the iLife and 
iWork suites as well as any of the applications bundled with Leopard.
 
 Install up to 4GB of total memory by removing the standard 1GB 
module and inserting high-capacity 2GB modules in both slots. 
(Naturally, if your laptop came with a single 2GB module installed, all 
you have to do is add another 2GB module to reach 4GB total Nirvana.)
 
 If your primary applications include video editing, game playing, or 
image editing, you can use all the memory your laptop can hold.

 Chapter 20: Adding New Stuff to Your Laptop
Although the MacBook Pro comes with a minimum of 2GB, the process is 
generally the same. The exception to the RAM upgrade circus is the MacBook 
Air, which is a sealed unit — you can’t upgrade your RAM at all.
Unfortunately, Apple’s prices for adding RAM are, well, outrageous (as in, 
“Boy, howdy, I can’t afford that!”) Therefore, I can heartily recommend any 
one of these online sources that cater to Mac owners:
 
 MacMall: www.macmall.com
 
 CDW: www.cdw.com/content/brands/apple/default.aspx
 
 Newegg: www.newegg.com
Installing memory modules
I’m happy to report that adding extra memory to your system is one of the 
easiest internal upgrades that you can perform. Therefore, I recommend 
that you add memory yourself unless you simply don’t want to mess with 
your MacBook’s internal organs. As I mention earlier, of course, your local 
Macintosh service specialist will be happy to install new RAM modules for 
you (for a price).
Climbing inside your Mac laptop
This section on laptop upgrades is short for a 
reason: Laptops simply aren’t meant to be dis-
assembled. As I mention several times in this 
book, internal expansion in your MacBook or 
MacBook Pro is severely limited. Basically, you 
can add extra memory and swap out your hard 
drive. Adding memory is easy, but swapping out 
your hard drive requires more work and con-
siderable preparation. And, as I also mention 
earlier in this book, you can’t make any internal 
modifications at all to your MacBook Air, which 
is a sealed unit. (Breaking in will very likely void 
your warranty.)
Therefore, I always recommend that you seek 
professional servicing when you need to repair 
your laptop. For example, if your laptop’s LCD 
screen is cracked or broken, do not try to fix it 
yourself! Sure, you might see a number of used 
LCD panels on eBay, but these parts aren’t 
designed to be easily swapped out, like a desk-
top computer’s video card. Besides, if you make 
a mistake when trying to fix something deep in 
the bowels of your laptop, you might end up 
causing more damage than you repair.
The moral of the story? Let your local Apple 
dealer’s service technicians perform major 
surgery on your laptop, and buy an AppleCare 
Protection Plan that will cover your laptop like 
a blanket for up to three years!

upcoming section, “Gotta have internal.”

Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
To add memory modules to a MacBook or MacBook Pro, follow these steps:
 
1. Get ready to operate.
 
a. Spread a clean towel on a stable work surface, such as your kitchen 
table.
 
 The towel helps protect your screen from scratches.
 
b. Find a Phillips screwdriver.
 
c. Shut down your laptop and wait at least ten minutes for it to cool 
down.
 
d. Unplug all cables from the computer.
 
2. Close the computer and flip it over on top of the towel.
 
3. Ground thyself!
 
 Check out the “Let’s get grounded!” sidebar in this chapter.
 
4. Remove the battery.
 
 Slide both of the release latches up to pop out the battery (as shown in 
Figure 20-1), and then lift it out.
 
Figure 20-1:

5. Remove the two screws holding the memory door closed.
 
 Place the two screws in a handy plastic bowl for safekeeping. Tah-dah! 
That wasn’t much of a challenge, was it? Here’s your chance to gaze 
with rapt fascination at a portion of the bare innards of your favorite 
computer.
 
6. Locate the memory modules in your Mac’s svelte chassis.
 
 Figure 20-2 illustrates their position.

7. If you’re replacing an existing memory module, remove it.
 
 To remove a memory module, gently spread the two tabs at the ends 
of the socket apart (as shown in Figure 20-3) and then lift and slide the 
module away from the socket.

 Save the old module in the static-free packaging that held the new 
module. Your old RAM (which you can now sell on eBay) will be pro-
tected from static electricity.
 
8. Position the new module in the socket.
 
a. Line up the module’s gold connectors toward the socket, at a 
25 degree angle.
 
b. Line up the notch in the module with the matching spacer in the 
socket.
 
 See what I mean in Figure 20-4.

Ford pickup truck.)
Congratulations! You’ve done it — you’re now a MacBook memory guru! To 
verify that all is well with your road warrior, boot the computer, click the 
Apple menu, and choose About This Mac. Your laptop should report the 
additional memory.

 Chapter 20: Adding New Stuff to Your Laptop
Considering a Hard Drive Upgrade?
Asking whether you can upgrade your hard drive is a trick question. Yes, 
you certainly can upgrade your hard drive. (Note: The 64GB solid-state drive 
available with the MacBook Air is not upgradeable.) But before you start crui-
sin’ the Internet for a 500GB monster, though, I have two suggestions:
 
 Don’t upgrade your internal hard drive yourself.
 
 Be sure you really need a hard drive upgrade.
And, all in all, Apple’s pretty generous when configuring hard drive stor-
age for its base systems — current models run with anywhere from an 80 to 
300GB drive.
Most folks simply don’t need more than 80GB of hard drive space (even 
with Windows loaded in a separate partition for use with Boot Camp, which 
I discuss in Chapter 2). You’re likely to find that you still have plenty of elbow-
room for a typical family’s needs on your hard drive unless you’re heavily into
 
 Digital video (DV)
 
 Cutting-edge video games
 
 Tons of digital audio
 
If you’re short on hard drive space, clean up your existing hard drive by 
deleting all the crud you don’t need, such as game and application demos, 
duplicate or “work” copies of images and documents, archived files you down-
loaded from the Internet, and the contents of your Trash. You can read how in 
Chapter 21.
Let’s get grounded!
Follow one cardinal rule when the unguarded 
insides of any computer are in easy reach: 
Always ground yourself before you touch 
anything! Your body can carry enough static 
electricity to damage the circuitry and chips 
that make up the brains of your MacBook, and 
touching those parts without grounding your-
self is an invitation for disaster.
Grounding yourself is easy to do: Just touch 
a metal surface for a few seconds before you 
dig in. After you ground yourself, you can then 
safely handle both the internal components of 
your laptop and any new hardware components 
that you might be installing (such as memory 
modules or a hard drive).
If you walk anywhere in the room — hunting for 
a screwdriver, perhaps, or taking a sip of liquid 
reinforcement that you’ve stashed a comfort-
able distance away — you must ground yourself 
again before you get back to work. Remember: 
You can pick up a static charge by simply walk-
ing. Go figure.

332
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
If you decide that you do need to upgrade your MacBook’s internal drive, I 
strongly recommend that you don’t install your new hard drive yourself. Call 
on the services of an Apple technician to upgrade your drive!
Consider your external options
If you do need additional hard drive space, I recommend using an exter-
nal drive! Use a high-speed FireWire or USB port to connect a second hard 
drive the quick and easy way. (MacBook Air owners can skip the stuff about 
FireWire because the Air doesn’t have a FireWire port.)
Most of today’s FireWire and USB peripherals don’t even require the driver 
software that Mac old-timers remember with such hatred. You simply plug 
in a FireWire or USB device, and it works. You can move your external drive 
between different Macs with a minimum of fuss and bother.
An external hard drive can do anything that your internal hard drive can do. 
You can boot from it, for example, or install a different version of Mac OS X 
(great for beta testers like me). External optical drives work just the same as 
internal models; Apple sells an external USB SuperDrive optical drive for the 
MacBook Air for about $100.
 
Apple’s Time Capsule unit is an external hard drive with a difference: It stores 
the huge Time Machine backup files created by the Macs running Leopard on 
your network, and it uses a wireless connection to transfer data! (In fact, if 
you’re thinking of adding a wireless base station to your wired network, your 
Time Capsule actually acts as a full AirPort Extreme Base Station, complete 
with USB port for connecting a USB printer.) At the time of this writing, Time 
Capsule is available with either a 500GB ($299) or 1TB ($499) drive.
 
Here’s one problem with external drives: Data transfers more slowly this way 
than via an internal drive (even with a FireWire 800 connection). That’s why 
most Mac owners use their external drives for storing little-used documents 
and applications. Their favorite applications and often-used documents are 
housed on the internal drive.
Putting a port to work
A MacBook can carry up to three kinds of high-speed ports, any of which is a 
good match for connecting any external device.
USB 2.0
The USB standard is popular because it’s just as common in the PC world as 
in the Mac world. (Most PCs don’t have a FireWire port.) Your laptop carries 
at least one USB 2.0 port on the side of the case. Hardware manufacturers can 
make one USB device that works on both types of computers.

333
 Chapter 20: Adding New Stuff to Your Laptop
 
I heartily recommend that you avoid using any USB 1.1 devices (except, per-
haps, a USB 1.1 keyboard or mouse). USB 1.1 is very slow compared with the 
USB 2.0 standard although you can connect a USB 1.1 device to a USB 2.0 port 
with no problem at all. You should buy only USB 2.0 external hard drives, 
CD/DVD recorders, or Flash drives. ’Nuff said.
FireWire 400
The original FireWire (also called IEEE 1394) is the best port for most digital 
video camcorders. Use your FireWire port for connecting external devices to 
your MacBook or MacBook Pro.
 
MacBook Air laptops don’t have a FireWire port.
FireWire 800
A FireWire 800 drive offers much better performance than either a FireWire 
400 or a USB 2.0 drive, and today’s FireWire 800 drives are getting cheaper 
every day. MacBook Pro laptops proudly sport a FireWire 800 port on the 
side; MacBook and MacBook Air computers don’t carry a FireWire 800 port.
 
The physical FireWire 800 connector is shaped differently than the FireWire 
400 port, so don’t try to force the wrong connector into the wrong port!
Connecting an external drive
With FireWire or USB, you can install an external hard drive without opening 
your laptop’s case. With your MacBook turned on and the external drive dis-
connected from the AC outlet, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the FireWire or USB cable betwixt the drive and your computer.
 
2. Plug the external drive into a convenient surge protector or UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply).
The MacBook Pro’s Mystery Slot
If you’re wondering what that slot is for on the 
left side of your MacBook Pro, you’ll be pleased 
to hear that it’s called an ExpressCard/34 slot. 
Why the glee? Well, some of the premium 
external devices for your laptop will use the 
ExpressCard/34 slot, which is like a drive-
through window that allows the fastest possible 
data transfer rates to and from your computer. 
For example, the fastest external eSATA hard 
drives available these days can be connected 
to your MacBook Pro via an ExpressCard/34 
adapter!
Although ExpressCard/34 hardware is gen-
erally more expensive than FireWire or USB 
hardware, the higher price may be justified by 
the speed increase — before you invest in an 
external device, do a little research and see 
whether the Mystery Slot can speed things up.

334
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
3. Switch on the external drive.
 
4. If the drive is unformatted (or formatted for use under Windows), 
partition and format the external drive.
 
 The drive comes with instructions or software for you to do this. (Don’t 
worry, your external drive comes from the factory completely empty, 
and you won’t damage anything by formatting it.) Partitioning divides 
the new drive into one (or more) volumes, each of which is displayed as 
a separate hard drive under Leopard.
 
 If the drive comes preformatted for use with a Windows PC, I strongly 
suggest reformatting it for use with Mac OS X — this will result in faster 
performance and more efficient use of space.
After the drive is formatted and partitioned, it immediately appears on the 
Desktop. Shazam!
Gotta have internal
If you decide that you have to upgrade your existing internal hard drive — or 
if your internal drive fails and needs to be replaced — you should always 
take your MacBook to an authorized Apple service center and allow the techs 
there to sell you a drive and make the swap. Here are four darned good 
reasons why:
 
 Warranty: You’re very likely to void your laptop’s warranty by attempt-
ing a drive upgrade yourself.
 
 Selection: If you’re worried about choosing the proper drive, your 
friendly neighborhood Apple technician can order the right type and 
size of drive for you.
 
 Difficulty: Swapping a hard drive in your Mac laptop isn’t anywhere as 
easy as adding RAM modules (although the hard drive is much easier to 
reach on the MacBook than it is on the MacBook Pro).
 
 Backup: That very same Apple service technician can back up all the 
data on your existing drive, format the new drive, and move all your 
data to its new mansion, so you won’t lose a single document. That will 
save you time and possible angst.
 
To those who truly won’t be satisfied with their lives until they upgrade an 
internal drive in a MacBook: Yes, I’m sure you can find a magazine article that 
purports to show you how. Even better, I’ve seen many how-to articles on the 
Web that will lead you down a rosy path to a hard drive upgrade. Here’s my 
take on those savvy instructions: You’re walking into a field of land mines with 
someone else’s map, so you had better have complete faith in your tech skills. 
(And a darn good backup.)

 Chapter 20: Adding New Stuff to Your Laptop
A List of Dreamy Laptop Add-Ons
The USB and FireWire toys I cover in this section might add a cord or two to 
your collection at the side of your road warrior, but they’re well worth the 
investment. And they can really revolutionize how you look at technologies, 
such as television, digital audio, and computer gaming.
Game controllers
If you’re ready to take a shot at the enemy — whether they be Nazi soldiers, 
chittering aliens, or the latest jet fighters — you’ll likely find your keyboard 
and mouse somewhat lacking. (And if that enemy happens to be a friend of 
yours playing across the Internet, you’ll be ruthlessly mocked while you’re 
fumbling for the right key combination.) Instead, either pick up a USB joystick 
(for flying games) or a gamepad (for arcade and first-person shooting games)!
Video controllers
For armchair directors, specialized USB digital video controllers make edit-
ing easier. The ShuttleXpress from Contour Design (www.contourdesign.
com) provides a five-button jog control that can be configured to match any 
DV editor. For $60, you get the same type of editing controller as dedicated 
video-editing stations costing several thousand dollars.
Audio hardware
Ready to put GarageBand to the test with your favorite version of Chopsticks? 
You’ll need a USB piano keyboard, and I recommend the KeyRig 49 from 
M-Audio (www.m-audio.com), which retails for a mere $130. It provides 49 
keys and uses a USB connection.
Another neat audio favorite of mine is the USB-powered radio SHARK 2 from 
Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.com), which allows you to 
add AM/FM radio to your laptop, complete with recording capability, a pause 
feature, and scheduled recording, all for $50.

Tackling the Housekeeping
In This Chapter
 Cleaning unnecessary stuff off your hard drive
 Backing up your data with Time Machine
 Fixing permission errors
 Automating tasks in Leopard
 Updating Mac OS X automatically
N
othing runs better than a well-oiled machine, and your laptop is no 
exception. With a little Leopard maintenance, you can ensure that your 
MacBook is performing as efficiently as possible (which translates into longer 
battery life).
In this chapter, I demonstrate how you can make good use of every byte of 
storage space provided by your hard drive, as well as how to back up and 
restore that hard drive to an external drive, using Time Machine. Your hard 
drive also benefits from a periodic scan for permission errors.
Leopard’s Automator application is a great housekeeping tool: It allows your 
laptop to perform tasks automatically that used to require your attention. 
I show you how you can create Automator applications and set them up to 
run by themselves. (It sounds a little spooky, but you’ll have a ball!)
And it’s important to never forget about updating Mac OS X itself. But then 
again, if you configure Software Update to run automatically, you can live 
life free and easy, watching your favorite soaps and eating ice cream 
(or yogurt — your pick).
Cleaning Unseemly Data Deposits
Criminy! Where does all this stuff come from? Suddenly that spacious 250GB 
hard drive has 19GB left, and you start feeling pinched.

338
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Before you consider buying a new internal or external hard drive (which you 
can read about in Chapter 20), take the smart step: “Sweep” your hard drive 
clean of unnecessary and space-hogging software.
Getting dirty (Or, cleaning things 
the manual way)
If you’re willing to dig into your data a little, there’s no reason to buy addi-
tional software to help you clean up your hard drive. All you really need is 
the willpower to announce, “I simply don’t need this application any longer.” 
(And, sometimes, that’s tougher than it might seem.)
Unnecessary files and unneeded folders
Consider all the stuff that you probably don’t really need:
 
 Game demos and shareware that you no longer play (or even remember)
 
 Movie trailers and other QuickTime video files that have long since 
passed into obscurity
 
 Temporary files that you created and promptly forgot
 
 Log files that chronicle application installations and errors
 
 StuffIt archives that you downloaded and no longer covet
 
 iTunes music that no longer appeals to your ear
How hard is it to clean this stuff off your drive? Easier than you might think!
 
 You can easily delete files.
 
 You can get rid of at least the lion’s share of any application (often the 
whole application) by deleting its application folder that was created 
during the installation process.
Removing an application or file from your hard drive is usually two simple 
steps:
 
1. Display the file or application folder in a Finder window.
 
2. Delete the file or folder with one of these steps:
 
• Drag the icon to the Trash.
 
• Press Ô+Delete.
 
• Right-click the icon and choose Move to Trash.
 
• Select the icon and click the Delete button on the Finder toolbar 
(if you added one).

339
 Chapter 21: Tackling the Housekeeping
Truly, no big whoop.
 
Don’t forget to actually empty the Trash, or you’ll wonder why you aren’t 
regaining any hard drive space. (Leopard works hard to store the contents of 
the Trash until you manually delete it, just in case you want to undelete some-
thing.) To get rid of that stuff permanently and reclaim the space
 
1. Click the Trash icon on the Dock and hold down the mouse button — 
or right-click — until the pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose Empty Trash.
Associated files in other folders
Some applications install files in different locations across your hard drive. 
(Applications in this category include Microsoft Office and Photoshop.) How 
can you clear out these “orphan” files after you delete the application folder?
The process is a little more involved than deleting a single folder, but it’s still 
no big whoop. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Click the Search text box in a Finder window.
 
 You can read more about Search and Finder windows in Chapter 7.
 
2. Type the name of the application in the Search text box.
 
 Figure 21-1 shows this search. I want to remove Toast Titanium, so I 
search for every file with the word toast in its name.
 
Figure 21-1: 
Mine your
 hard 
drive for 
additional 
files to 
delete.
 

340
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
3. Decide which of these files belong to the to-be-deleted application.
 
 Be sure that the files you choose to delete are part of the deleted appli-
cation. For example, a text file with the name Instructions on Making a 
Perfect Piece of Toast might not be part of Toast Titanium.
 
 Many associated files either
 
• Have the same icon as the parent application
 
• Are in the Preferences, Caches, or Application Support folders
 
4. In the Search Results window, click the associated file(s) that you 
want to delete and just drag them to the Trash.
 
 Don’t empty the Trash immediately after you delete these files. Wait a 
few hours or a day. That way, if you realize that you deleted a file that 
you truly need, you can easily restore it from the Trash.
Using a commercial cleanup tool
If you’d rather use a commercial application to help you clean up your 
hard drive, a number of them are available, but most are shareware and 
perform only one task. For example, Tidy Up! from Hyperbolic Software 
(www.hyperbolicsoftware.com) finds only duplicate files on your hard 
drive, matching by criteria such as filename, size, and extension. It’s a good 
tool at $30.
For a truly comprehensive cleanup utility, I recommend Spring Cleaning, from 
Smith Micro Software (my.smithmicro.com), the same company that pro-
duces the archiving utility StuffIt. Spring Cleaning is a bargain at $50, because 
not much crud squeaks by the application’s search routines, including dupli-
cates, orphan preference files, and log files. Spring Cleaning even includes a 
separate feature called MacUninstaller that can help automate the steps that 
I cover in the preceding section.
Backing Up Your Treasure
Do it. I’m not going to lecture you about backing up your hard drive . . . well, 
perhaps just for a moment. Imagine what it feels like to lose everything — 
names, numbers, letters, reports, presentations, saved games, photographs, 
and music. Then ask yourself, “Self, isn’t all that irreplaceable stuff worth just 
a couple of hours every month?” Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Back up. On a regular basis. Then store those DVDs or that external backup 
device somewhere safe, away from calamities.™

341
 Chapter 21: Tackling the Housekeeping
You can back up your files either by saving them to external media or by 
using Leopard’s awesome new Time Machine feature.
Saving files
The simplest method of backing up files is simply to copy the files and fold-
ers to an external hard drive or a CD or DVD. Nothing fancy, but it works.
Backing up to an external hard drive
If you use an external hard drive with your MacBook, you can easily drag 
backup files to it from your internal hard drive:
 
1. Open separate Finder windows for
 
• The external hard drive
 
• The internal hard drive
 
2. Select the desired files that you want to back up from your internal 
drive.
 
3. Drag the selected files to the external drive window.
 
Chapter 20 covers external hard drives.
Backing up to CD and DVD
You can burn backup files to a recordable CD or DVD. Owners of the 
MacBook Air will need to use an external SuperDrive, however.
Burning backups from the Finder
To use the Finder’s Burn feature with a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
 
1. Load a blank disc into your MacBook’s optical drive.
 
 If you’re using the default settings in the CDs & DVDs pane in System 
Preferences, a dialog asks you for a disc name.
 
2. Into the disc’s Finder window, drag the files and folders that you want 
to back up.
 
 They can be organized any way you like. Don’t forget that the total 
amount of data shouldn’t exceed 700MB on a CD. You should also stick 
within 4GB or so (on a standard recordable DVD) or 8GB (on a dual-layer 
recordable DVD). You can see how much free space remains on the disc 
at the bottom of the disc’s Finder window. 

342
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
3. Click File and then choose Burn Disc from the menu.
 
 You can also click the Burn button on the Recordable DVD bar — it 
appears at the top of the disc’s Finder window.
 
4. Choose the fastest recording speed possible.
 
5. Click Burn.
Burning backups from other recording applications
If you’ve invested in Toast Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) or 
another CD/DVD recording application, you can create a new disc layout to 
burn your backup disc. (Think of a layout as a “road map” indicating which 
files and folders Toast should store on the backup.)
Putting things right with Time Machine
If you enable backups via Leopard’s new Time Machine feature, you can lit-
erally move backward through the contents of your MacBook’s hard drive, 
selecting and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously 
easy to restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed, 
no matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can 
even handle such deleted items as Address Book entries or photos you sent 
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every Mac 
owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included on the Dock. (Apple is 
not messing around!)
 
Apple’s Time Capsule device is designed as a wireless storage drive for your 
Time Machine backup files. If you’re interested in a single Time Machine 
backup location for multiple Macs across your wireless network, Time 
Capsule is a great addition to your home or office.
 
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time 
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover the Time Machine configuration 
settings (and how to turn the feature on) in more detail in Chapter 6. 
Here’s how you can turn back time, step by step, to restore a file that you 
deleted or replaced in a folder.
 
1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
 
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch 
the Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon on 
the Dock (which bears a rather funky clock with a counterclockwise 
arrow).

 Chapter 21: Tackling the Housekeeping
 
 The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your 
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the screen 
(as shown in Figure 21-2). On the right, you see a timeline that corre-
sponds to the different days and months included in the backups that 
Leopard has made.
 
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the 
folder’s contents on that date).
 
 Alternatively, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move 
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces 
of Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate some-
thing you deleted several weeks ago!)
 
 The backup date of the items you’re viewing appears in the button bar 
at the bottom of the screen.
  
4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.
 
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine button 
bar.
 
 If you want to restore all the contents of the folder, click the Restore All 
button instead.

Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now 
appearing in the folder. Out-standing!
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine has everything that 
a typical Mac owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy 
Mark’s Maxim to predict:
 
Turn on Time Machine. Do it now. Don’t make a humongous mistake.™
Maintaining Hard Drive Health
Shifty-eyed, sneaky, irritating little problems can bother your hard drive: 
permissions errors. Incorrect disk and file permissions can
 
 Make your MacBook lock up
 
 Make applications act screwy (or refuse to run at all)
 
 Cause weird behavior within a Finder window or System Preferences
To keep Leopard running at its best, I recommend that you fix permissions 
errors at least once per week.
To fix any permissions errors on your system, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon.
 
3. Click the volume at the left (which in this case is a named partition, 
like Macintosh HD, which appears under your physical hard drive) 
that you want to check.
 
4. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
 
 Disk Utility does the rest and then displays a message about whatever it 
has to fix. (When will someone invent a car with a Repair Me button?)
Automating Those Mundane Chores
One popular feature in Leopard — Automator — has generated a lot of 
excitement. You use Automator (as shown in Figure 21-3) to create applica-
tions with a compiled form of AppleScript. (In case you’re not familiar with 
AppleScript, it’s the simple programming language that you can use to auto-
mate tasks and applications within Leopard.)

Of course, that might sound daunting — akin to building your own nuclear 
submarine single-handedly over a long weekend — but Automator is actually 
easy to use. Heck, you might find it downright fun!
You can also create workflows, which are sequential (and repeatable) opera-
tions that are performed on the same files or data, and then your Automator 
application can automatically launch whatever applications are necessary to 
get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a 
CD every week with new product shots for your company’s marketing 
department. Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 
12-megapixel camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before 
you move them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to labori-
ously resize each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.
With help from Automator, though, you can build a custom application 
that automatically reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and 
even generates a thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves 

346
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
the massaged images to the proper folder. You’d normally have to manu-
ally launch Preview to perform the image operations and then use a Finder 
window to move the new files to the right location. But now, with Automator, 
a single double-click of your custom application icon does the trick.
You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator 
can handle specific tasks within about 30 or 40 applications (including the 
Finder), but both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new 
Automator task support to all sorts of new and existing applications.
To create a simple application with Automator, launch the application and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
 
2. Click the desired item in the Library list.
 
 Automator displays the actions available for the item you’ve selected. 
Some of these items are media files, while others include Address Book 
contacts, files and folders in the Finder, PDF documents, and even Apple 
Mail messages.
 
3. Drag the desired action from the Library window to the workflow 
window.
 
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
 
6. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.
 
 Use sample files while you’re fine-tuning your application lest you acci-
dentally do something deleterious to an original (and irreplaceable) file!
 
7. When the application is working as you like, press Ô+Shift+S to save it.
 
8. In the Save dialog that appears, type a name for your new application.
 
9. Click the Where pop-up menu and specify a location where the file 
should be saved.
 
10. Click the File Format pop-up menu and choose Application.
 
11. Click Save.
 
 Your new Automator application icon includes the Automator robot 
standing on a document. Why, most normal human beings would now 
call you a programmer, so make sure you’re inscrutable from now on! If 
you’re going to use your new Automator application often, don’t forget 
that you can make it more convenient to use by dragging the application 
icon to your Dock or to your Desktop.

347
 Chapter 21: Tackling the Housekeeping
 
To find all the actions of a certain type within the Library list, click in the 
Search box at the bottom of the Library window and type in a keyword, such 
as save or burn. You don’t even need to press Return!
If your Automator application should run every time you log in — for exam-
ple, an application to track your time on a project — follow these steps to set 
it up as a Login Item:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Display the Accounts pane.
 
3. Click the Login Items button.
 
4. Click the plus button at the bottom of the list.
 
5. Navigate to the location of your new Automator application.
 
6. Click Add.
 
 Now your Automator application is really automatic. Watch your signifi-
cant other gape in amazement as your MacBook begins to work without 
you touching the keyboard! (If you’ve added the application icon to your 
Dock, you can also simply right-click on the icon and choose Open at 
Login from the right-click menu that appears. Either way, your MacBook 
gets the message.)
Updating Mac OS X Automatically
I prefer my MacBook to take care of cleaning up after itself, so updating 
Leopard should be automatic as well. In Mac OS X Leopard, operating system 
updates are performed by the Software Update application.
 
Software Update uses the Internet, so you need an Internet connection to 
shake hands with the Apple server and download any updates.
Software Update can be found in two convenient spots:
 
 The Apple menu: Click the Apple menu (Ú) and then choose Software 
Update, which displays the Update dialog and alerts you to anything 
new that’s available.
 
 System Preferences: Click the Software Update icon to display the 
Software Update pane.

348
Part VI: Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
 If you take the System Preferences route, you can set Software Update to 
check for updates automatically:
 
a. Mark the Check for Updates check box to enable it.
 
b. Choose the time period from the Check for Updates pop-up menu.
 
 Software Update covers every Apple application, so I usually check once 
daily just to make sure that I don’t miss anything.
 
 If something needs to be updated, the program alerts you, either auto-
matically downloading the update(s) or displaying a dialog letting you 
know what you can update (depending on the settings you choose in the 
System Preferences Software Update pane).
You can even check for updates immediately from System Preferences. That, 
dear reader, is just plain thoughtful design.

h, the sedentary life of a desktop Mac — it sits there, like a bump on 
a log, comfortable and immobile. As long as you have a stable surface 
and an uninterrupted power supply, your Mac Pro is a happy puppy.
But you, good reader, are mobile! Whether you’re on campus or attending a 
convention, your Mac laptop is rarely running in the same spot, so it’s sus-
ceptible to all sorts of road warrior pitfalls. In this chapter, I remind you of 
ten of the most important rules that every laptop owner should follow to 
prevent chaos and carnage while traveling.
Keep Your Laptop in a Bag
Sure, using a laptop case or bag sounds like common sense — but Mac lap-
tops are so doggone sexy that you’d be surprised how many people carry 
them around without any protection at all. These Mac owners hear phrases 
like “rugged titanium” and “Sudden Motion Sensor hard drive protection” and 
figure that their laptop can tackle a construction site, a college campus, or a 
hotel room with impunity.

352
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Part of that is indeed true. Mac laptops are some of the toughest laptops ever 
made, but they’re not immune to bumps, scratches, and the (I hope) rare fall. 
But if you carry your MacBook from place to place without any protection, 
it’ll soon look like a boxer after a bad fight.
If you’re like me, you’re proud that your computers remain in pristine condi-
tion, so use a laptop bag or case that offers ample padding and a convenient 
shoulder strap or carry handle. (My laptop bag even converts to a backpack, 
and it includes plenty of extra space for power supplies, discs, and all the 
assorted hoo-hah that you know you need to carry with you.) Spend an extra 
$30 on a laptop bag, and your $1,000 computer can weather the worst the 
world will dish out.
Many folks think that a traditional laptop bag draws too much attention — 
and to some extent, I agree. (That’s one reason why no one totes an obvious 
15 x 7 bag with a hardware manufacturer’s logo emblazoned on the side these 
days.) If you’re a member of this group, consider a well-padded laptop sleeve 
that will allow you to carry your MacBook in your backpack or briefcase — 
the laptop always goes in on top of those heavy books, of course. Remember, 
though, that the padding is the important thing — without that extra cushion, 
you might as well just toss your unprotected laptop in with the rest of your 
books and must-have equipment.
Maximize Your RAM
Like any other computer running Windows or Mac OS X, your laptop will 
benefit from all the system RAM (memory) that you can squeeze onto it. 
(Chapter 20 describes how to add memory and the benefits of extra RAM.) 
However, additional memory is even more effective with a laptop because 
your Mac laptop’s internal hard drive runs more slowly than the correspond-
ing internal hard drive in a full-size desktop Mac. Therefore, the virtual 
memory functionality built into Leopard (which I also describe in Chapter 
20) will be even slower for your laptop, resulting in mediocre performance 
during memory-intensive tasks such as video and image editing.
With a full complement of RAM, your laptop’s performance will rival the 
performance of a desktop computer with the same processor — and you’ll be 
using it on the go!
As I also mention in Chapter 20, MacBook Air owners need not worry about 
upgrading their system RAM: The current Air models come from Apple 
already packed with the maximum amount of RAM they can carry (2GB), and 
you can’t upgrade (or even reach) the memory modules in your Air.

353
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Laptop Rules to Follow
Install a Tracker Application
The unthinkable happens: Your laptop is stolen while you’re on vacation or 
on a business trip, and you know that the chances that it will be returned are 
next to nil. You’ve resigned yourself to replacing it (and all your data). But 
wait! What if I told you that you might just receive an e-mail message on your 
desktop computer that tells you the Internet (IP) address of the thief or 
perhaps even the telephone number he or she is using?
If this scenario sounds a little like a James Bond movie, you’ll be surprised to 
discover that several tracker applications are available for Leopard that will 
run invisibly on your laptop. A tracker application can turn your MacBook into 
a transmitting beacon, broadcasting its current location and all the Internet 
information it can get to you — allowing you to alert police and apprehend the 
crook (who might be in the middle of creating an iPhoto library).
For example, XTool Laptop Tracker from XTool Mobile Security (www.xtool.
com) invisibly sends a signal to the company’s security center each time your 
laptop is connected to the Internet or a telephone line, as well as when the 
computer is rebooted or a user logs on. XTool Laptop Tracker costs about 
$70 per year, which is pocket change for a corporate Road Warrior or design 
professional who depends on both the laptop and the irreplaceable data it 
contains.
Keepest Thy Home Folder Encrypted
In Chapter 6, I discuss a number of System Preferences panes. The Security 
pane is particularly important to laptop users because it allows you to 
encrypt your Leopard Home folder. Encryption prevents just about anyone 
from accessing (or even identifying) any of the files you’ve stored in your 
Home folder. The robust encryption provided by Leopard will certainly 
stymie just about anyone but the NSA and FBI. (I won’t even go there.)
In System Preferences, click Security, click the FileVault button, and then 
click Set Master Password to create a backup password that will unlock your 
Home folder, just in case. (Your login account password is your primary 
password.) Select Turn On FileVault, and Leopard takes care of automatically 
encrypting and unencrypting files as necessary.
 
To take full advantage of an encrypted Home folder, you need the proper login 
mode (as I discuss in Chapter 16). Think about this possible security back-
door: From the Accounts pane, you’ve set your laptop to automatically log you 
in every time you boot your MacBook. This is the very definition of Not Secure 
because your login account password automatically bypasses the FileVault 
encryption! Therefore, make sure that you actually have to log in to access 
your account; for the full scoop, see Chapter 16.

354
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Brand Your MacBook
Put your brand on your laptop! Whether with an engraving tool on the 
bottom of the machine (my personal favorite) or a permanent metal tag, your 
MacBook deserves some sort of identifying information. After all, most of the 
people in the world are honest, and you might not need that tracking soft-
ware that I mention earlier in this chapter. You might have left your laptop by 
accident, and someone would like to return it to you. (Don’t forget to offer a 
reward!)
Some laptop owners will want to include their name and address and other 
contact information, while other Road Warriors might feel more comfortable 
with just their name and e-mail address. Whatever you choose, branding your 
laptop is as important as backing it up.
Disable Your Wireless
Funny how we don’t think about it, but wireless communications take juice, 
and that power comes straight from your laptop’s battery! Because your Mac 
laptop comes with a built-in AirPort Express card and built-in Bluetooth hard-
ware, you’re constantly broadcasting — sending and receiving, or at least 
trying to exchange data with others.
And therein lies the rub: If you’re not connected to a wireless network or a 
Bluetooth device, you’re wasting your precious battery power. That’s why 
Leopard gives you the ability to turn off your wireless Ethernet and Bluetooth 
hardware to save energy. And when you’re sitting in a crowded auditorium 
without access to an AC socket or a wireless network, the energy savings you 
reap when you disable your wireless hardware can be significant.
 
In fact, you might have to disable your wireless connectivity in situations 
where cellphones are not allowed, such as on an airplane flight, or in certain 
areas of a hospital. And, because I’m a security-conscious kind of guy, I always 
disable my wireless hardware whenever I’m not using it (even if I am in range 
of a wireless network). Call me overly careful, but none of my shared files have 
ever been sucked out of my MacBook without my permission!
To turn off your wireless Ethernet from the Leopard Finder menu, click the 
AirPort status icon and choose Turn Airport Off from the menu. To turn off 
your Bluetooth hardware from the Finder menu, click the Bluetooth icon and 
choose Turn Bluetooth Off.

355
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Laptop Rules to Follow
Bring a Surge Protector with You
I’ll be honest: I usually am not a huge supporter of surge protectors because 
I think they do only half the job. That job is protecting both your hardware 
and your data . . . and, as you probably know, a surge protector doesn’t pro-
vide backup power in case of a brownout or total loss of power like a UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply) can.
Of course, many locales around the world offer a less-than-perfect power 
grid, which translates into a sudden loss of power — usually at exactly 
the wrong moment. (Think Great American Novel Takes a Nosedive.) Your 
MacBook is smart enough to immediately switch from AC current to its bat-
tery in case of a power failure. So why am I suggesting a surge protector for 
your laptop, especially seeing as how it adds bulk and weight to your laptop 
bag or luggage?
 
 The risk of a power spike: A surge protector is good protection from a 
massive power spike, such as an overload or a lightning strike.
 
 Extra sockets on tap: Don’t forget that you might need several more 
AC sockets for external devices, such as a hard drive, projector, and 
portable printer. A surge protector can provide the extra power, even 
when your host can’t.
 
Naturally, if you’re traveling to a country with different AC standards (and dif-
ferent socket configurations), invest in an AC plug adapter that’s compatible 
with the standard used at your destination.
Use Leopard Power-Saving Features
Apple allows you considerable control over how fast your CPU will run, 
which is a real boon to power hungry laptop owners. In System Preferences, 
click Energy Saver to display the Settings For and Optimization list boxes.
If you’re running your laptop while connected to an AC outlet, click the 
Settings For drop-down list box and click Power Adapter; then click the 
Optimization list box and choose the Better Performance setting. This setting 
provides the best performance your laptop’s processor can provide — all 
your applications will run their fastest — but it also uses the most electricity.
If your laptop is running on battery power and you need to conserve as much 
power as possible, click the Settings For drop-down list box and click Battery; 
then choose Better Battery Life from the Optimization list box. Now you’re 
squeezing the maximum amount of computing time out of your remaining 
battery power. (Your laptop will also run much cooler.)

356
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Use an External Keyboard and Mouse
Does your laptop remain at your home, dorm room, or office for long periods 
of time? If so, I recommend that you invest in an external keyboard and an 
external mouse for two very good reasons:
 
 Adding external input devices helps lower the wear and tear on your 
laptop’s keyboard and trackpad.
 
 External input devices are generally more comfortable and convenient 
to use than those offered by your Mac laptop, especially for gaming.
If price is no obstacle, a wireless keyboard and mouse will allow you far more 
freedom of movement, but a standard USB keyboard and mouse will do just 
as fine a job and will cost considerably less.
In fact, you can have two external keyboards if you like: one to work with 
your laptop while you’re running Leopard (which will have all the keys 
unique to an Apple keyboard) and one to use when you’re running Windows 
(with those gnarly Windows-specific keys). Techno-suave.
Not Again! What Is It with 
You and Backing Up?
Yes, it’s one of the Top Ten Laptop Rules as well. I’m not kidding: If you 
think you don’t need to back up on a regular basis, you will eventually 
lose every byte of data you have. Period. It’s only a matter of time. Even if 
you have incredible luck and don’t do something you regret with a Finder 
window, your MacBook is just a machine, and it will wear out in the long run. 
(Especially with the mobile life of a Road Warrior, with all the bumps and 
bruises of travel.) That’s why hard drive manufacturers list MTBF — Mean 
Time Between Failures — figures for their hard drives.
Backing up your hard drive isn’t difficult and doesn’t take long. Chapter 21 
explains everything you need to know. And after you finish your first full 
backup, drop me a line at mark@mlcbooks.com with the subject I’ve Got 
Laptop Peace of Mind! We can celebrate together.

f you’ve read other books that I’ve written in the For Dummies series, you 
might recognize the title of this chapter — it’s a favorite Part of Tens sub-
ject of mine. I don’t like to see any computer owner fall prey to pitfalls. Some 
are minor (such as not keeping your laptop clean), and others are downright 
catastrophic (such as providing valuable information over the Internet to 
persons unknown).
All these potential mistakes, however, share one thing in common: They’re 
easy to prevent with a little common sense — that is, as long as you’re aware 
of them. And that’s my job. In this chapter, I fill in what you need to know. 
Consider these pages as experience gained easily!

358
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
USB 1.1 Storage Devices
Man, that is the very definition of sluggish. Let’s see, what could I be talking 
about? Oh, yes . . . only a creaking USB 1.1 external device such as a hard 
drive or CD-ROM drive could be as slow as a turtle on narcotics.
Unfortunately, you still find countless examples of USB 1.1 storage hardware 
hanging around. eBay is stuffed to the gills with USB 1.1 hard drives, and your 
family and friends will certainly want to bestow that old 4x CD-RW drive to 
you as a gift. (This is one that you should politely refuse immediately, just 
like your Aunt Harriet’s fruitcake.) These drives were considered cool in the 
early days of the colorful iMac G3, when USB was a new technology. Today, a 
USB 1.1 hard drive is simply a slow-as-maple-syrup-in-January embarrassment.
I do admit that plenty of great USB 1.1 devices are still around these days, 
such as joysticks, keyboards, mice, and other controllers, along with print-
ers and scanners that work just fine with slower transfer rates. However, if 
a peripheral’s job is to store or move data quickly — including hard drives, 
network connections, CD-ROM drives, and USB Flash drives — give a USB 1.1 
connection a wide berth, opting instead for a USB 2.0 or FireWire device.
Phishing Operations
Phishing is no phun. No, that’s not a misspelling. In Internet lingo, phishing 
refers to an attempt by unsavory characters to illegally obtain your personal 
information. If that sounds like an invitation to identity theft, it is — and 
thousands of sites have defrauded individuals like you and me (along with 
banks and credit card companies) out of billions of dollars. Unfortunately, 
the phishing industry has been growing like a weed, and more innocent folks 
are being ripped off every day. (The low-life running phishing operations are 
pond scum . . . and I’m being polite here because this will appear in print.)
A phishing scam works like this: You get an e-mail purporting to be from a major 
company or business, such as eBay, a government agency, or a major credit 
card company. The message warns you that you have to “update” your login 
or financial information to keep it current, or that you have to “validate” your 
information every so often — and even provides you with a convenient link to 
an official-looking Web page. After you enter your oh-so-personal information on 
that bogus page, it’s piped directly to the bad guys, and they’re off to the races.
Here’s a Mark’s Maxim that every Internet user should take to heart:
 
No legitimate company or agency will ever solicit your personal information 
through an e-mail message!™

359
 Chapter 23: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague
 
Never respond to these messages. If you smell something phishy, open your 
Web browser and visit the company’s site (the real one) directly. Then con-
tact the company’s customer support department. They’ll certainly want to 
know about the phishing expedition, and you can help by providing them with 
the e-mail and Web addresses used in the scam.
In fact, sending any valuable financial information through unencrypted 
e-mail — even to those whom you know and trust — is a bad idea. E-mail 
messages can be intercepted or read from any e-mail server that stores 
your messages.
Oddly Shaped Optical Discs
Your Mac laptop’s optical drive is a marvel of precision — and it’s doggone 
svelte to boot. Every current Apple laptop model (including the external 
drive available for the MacBook Air) features the latest optical drives, which 
don’t require silly trays. Just slide your CD or DVD inside the drive, and it 
smoothly disappears from sight. Press the Eject key, or drag the disc icon on 
your desktop to the trash, and the disc appears like magic. No need to give 
the loading and ejecting procedures a second thought, right?
Well, good reader, that’s true — but only if you’re loading a standard 1.2mm 
thick, 120mm round CD or DVD into your drive! Notice that I didn’t say
 
 An 80mm mini-disc: Yes, they’re cute. Yes, they’re used by all sorts of 
devices these days, from DV camcorders to digital cameras. But, no, 
they’re not supported by many slot-loading drives, so there’s a good 
chance one will refuse to eject.
 
 A credit-card or triangular-shaped disc: Friends, these discs just aren’t 
natural! Of course, that’s part of their pizzazz for advertisers, who give 
them away in scads. A square disc will work in a tray-loading drive, but a 
slot drive will likely get indigestion and refuse to eject it.
 
 A super-thick disc: Sure, a tray DVD drive will likely be able to accept a 
disc with a thick printed paper label, but if that disc is more than 1.5mm 
thick, it can actually damage your laptop’s slot-loading drive. Consider 
these words: “Marge, it’s stuck in there!” Now imagine how you would 
feel if you were the one saying that.
 
All three of these oddly shaped discs share one thing in common: The damage 
you may cause by attempting to use one in your MacBook is not covered under 
your Apple warranty. A weighty statement indeed.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Submerged Keyboards
Do you really want a submerged keyboard? Your answer should be an 
unequivocal, “No!” And that’s why everyone should make it a rule to keep all 
beverages well out of range of keyboards, trackpads, and external devices, 
such as speakers and mice. Especially when kids or cats are in close proxim-
ity to your laptop.
If a soda spill comes in contact with your MacBook, you’re likely to be visited 
with intermittent keyboard problems (or, in the worst-case scenario, a short in 
your laptop’s motherboard). Suffice it to say that 12 inches of open space can 
make the difference between a simple cleanup and an expensive replacement!
Antiquated Utility Software
It’s the upgrade game, and everyone’s gotta play. If you’re using Mac OS X 
Leopard, you must upgrade your older utility programs — such as an older 
copy of TechTool Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.com) that supports 
only Mac OS X Tiger. I know that you spent good money on ’em, but these 
older disk utility applications can do more damage than good to a hard drive 
under Mac OS X Leopard. Of course, utility software designed for earlier ver-
sions of Mac OS X (such as Panther and Jaguar) should be strictly avoided!
A number of things change when Apple makes the leap to a new version of 
Mac OS X, including subtle changes to disk formats, memory management in 
applications, and the support provided for different types of hard drives. If 
you use an older utility application, you could find yourself with corrupted 
data. Sometimes a complete operating system reinstall is necessary.
Now that you’re using Mac OS X Leopard, make sure that you diagnose and 
repair disk and file errors using only a utility application specifically designed 
to run in Leopard. Your laptop’s hard drive will definitely thank you.
Software Piracy
This one’s a no-brainer: Don’t endorse software piracy. Remember, Apple’s 
overall market share among worldwide computer users currently weighs in at 
around 10 percent. Software developers know this, and they have to expect 
(and receive) a return on their investment, or they’re going to find something 
more lucrative to do with their time. As a shareware author, I can attest to 
this firsthand.

 Chapter 23: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague
Pirated software seems attractive — the price is right, no doubt about it — 
but if you use an application without buying it, you’re cheating the developer, 
who will eventually find Macintosh programming no longer worth the time 
and trouble. Believe me, a MacBook is a great machine, and Leopard is a 
great operating system, but the sexiest laptop and the best hardware won’t 
make up for an absence of good applications.
Pay for what you use, and everyone benefits.
The Forbidden Account
You might never have encountered the root, or System Administrator, account 
in Mac OS X — and that’s always A Good Thing. Note that I’m not talking 
about a standard Administrator (or Admin) account here. Every Mac needs at 
least one Admin account (in fact, it might be the only visible account on your 
computer), and any Standard user account can be toggled between Standard 
and Admin status with no trouble at all.
The root account, though, is a different beast altogether, and that’s why it’s 
disabled by default. All Unix systems have a root account. Leopard is based 
on a Unix foundation, so it has one, too. Anyone logging in with the root 
account can do anything on your system, including deleting or modifying files 
in the System folder (which no other account can access). Believe me, delib-
erately formatting your hard drive is about the only thing worse than screw-
ing up the files in your System folder.
Luckily, no one can access the root/System Administrator account by acci-
dent. In fact, you can’t assign the root account through System Preferences at 
all; you have to use the Directory Utility application located in your Utilities 
folder. Unless an Apple support technician tells you to enable and use it, you 
should promptly forget that the root account even exists.
Unsecured Wireless Connections
Okay, I like free Internet access as much as the next technology author — it’s 
cool, it’s convenient, and public access wireless networks are popping up all 
over the world. Heck, New Orleans is currently upgrading to citywide free 
wireless Internet access, which is perfect for checking your e-mail whilst 
you’re catching beads or listening to jazz. More and more cities are certain to 
follow in the near future.

362
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
However, just because something is free doesn’t mean that it’s safe. 
(Impromptu bungee jumpers, take note.) Unfortunately, the free public wire-
less access you’re likely to encounter is not secure: Anyone can join, and the 
information you send and receive can be intercepted by any hacker worthy of 
the name. A public network uses no WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) key, so 
no encryption is involved, and therefore no guarantee that your private e-mail, 
your company’s financial spreadsheets, and your Great American Novel aren’t 
being intercepted while you’re uploading and downloading them in the airport.
 
If you must use your laptop on an unsecured public network, make sure that 
the connection itself is secure instead. For example, don’t check your e-mail 
by using a Web browser unless your ISP or e-mail service offers an encrypted 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. (Yep, I’m talking again about that 
little padlock that appears in Safari, which I discuss in Chapter 8. It’s not just 
for ordering things online!) If you need to establish a secure connection with 
your home or office network, use an SSL-enabled Virtual Private Network 
(VPN) client, which allows you to transfer files and remotely operate a host 
computer with bulletproof security. (Visit www.gracion.com and download 
a trial copy of DigiTunnel for Mac OS X. The full version sells for about $60. 
You’ll sleep better at night, Road Warrior.)
Refurbished Hardware
Boy, howdy, do I hate refurbished stuff. Like my single-minded quest to rid 
the world of floppy disks, I likewise make it a point to dispel the myth that 
you’re actually saving money when you buy a refurbished (or “remanufac-
tured”) piece of hardware. To quote someone famous, “If the deal sounds too 
good to be true, it probably is.”
Examine what you get when you buy a refurbished external hard drive. It’s 
likely that the drive was returned as defective, of course, and was then sent 
back to the factory. There the manufacturer probably performed the most 
cursory of repairs (just enough to fix the known problem), perhaps tested 
the unit for a few seconds, and then packed it back up again. Legally, retailers 
can’t resell the drive as a new item, so they have to cut the price so low that 
you’re willing to take the chance.
Before you spend a dime on a bargain that’s remanufactured — I can’t get 
over that term — make sure that you find out how long a warranty you’ll 
receive, if any. Consider that the hardware is likely to have crisscrossed the 
country at least once, and that it’s likely to have picked up a few bumps and 
bruises during its travels. Also, you have no idea how well the repairs were 
tested or how thoroughly everything was inspected.

363
 Chapter 23: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague
I don’t buy refurbished computers or hardware, and most of the tales that 
I’ve heard of folks who do have ended badly. Take my advice: Spend the extra 
cash on trouble-free, new hardware that has a full warranty.
Dirty Laptops
Clean your machine. Every computer (and every piece of computer hard-
ware) appreciates a weekly dusting.
 
Adding memory to your laptop? Seeing as how you have to open your Mac 
anyway, take advantage of the chance to use that trusty can of compressed air.
On the outside of your laptop, your screen should be cleaned at least once 
every two or three days — that is, unless you like peering through a layer 
of dust, fingerprints, and smudges. Never spray anything directly on your 
screen or your Mac’s case. I highly recommend using premoistened LCD 
cleaning wipes typically used for notebook computers.
Your laptop’s case really doesn’t need a special cleaning agent — in fact, you 
shouldn’t use any solvents — but a thorough wipe with a soft cloth should 
keep your case in spotless shape.
