About the Author
Keith Massey has been studying languages his whole life, starting with high school 
Latin and continuing to a PhD in Biblical Hebrew and Arabic at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. After 9/11, he went to work at the Top Secret National Security 
Agency as an Arabic linguist, where he served for more than four years. He now teaches 
Latin and Arabic in New Jersey, summering with his wife in her native Romania. An avid 
traveler, Keith has visited 15 different countries, 5 of which have been Arabic-speaking 
countries.
Dedication
To my father Bill and my late mother Nancy, who taught me the value of hard work.
And to Dustin Cowell, my first Arabic instructor. May this book further the mutual 
understanding between cultures to which you have devoted your life.

Introduction
I
f you’ve picked up this book, you’ve likely succeeded in learning the beginning 
level of Modern Standard Arabic. !( ﻣﹶﺒﹾﺮﻭﻙmabruuk! Congratulations!) What you’ve 
accomplished is no easy feat. Unlike the Romance languages, such as French and 
Spanish, your English didn’t really help you at all with Arabic. Instead, you were learn-
ing a language with completely different ways of expressing everything.
Now you’re ready to take your Arabic to the next level and improve your writing 
skills. You may be a student in an Arabic course looking for something to supplement 
your course materials and help you get a higher grade. Or perhaps you plan to visit 
an Arabic-speaking country sometime soon. Or maybe you’re conducting business 
with Arabic speakers and know that being able to write an official letter in Arabic will 
give you an edge (and it will). Whatever your reason, Intermediate Arabic For Dummies 
can help you achieve your particular needs. You’ll even have some fun along the way.
About This Book
Intermediate Arabic For Dummies is primarily a workbook for people who have a basic 
to beginning knowledge of Arabic and are ready to move to the next level of ability by 
improving their writing skills. That’s why it’s important that you not just read this 
book, but you use it as well! Write notes to yourself in the margin, and highlight 
things you want to concentrate on.
More importantly, however, you should complete each exercise in your own hand-
writing in the spaces provided. Then you can easily compare your answers with the 
correct answers provided in the key at the end of each chapter. You may even want 
to reinforce each exercise by then writing out the answer again to correct any mistakes 
you made. Believe it or not, you’ll remember things you see in your own handwriting 
much more efficiently than you would by just looking at the type-written answers.
Each chapter of this book gives you exercises that let you practice your Arabic writ-
ing in the topic that’s being focused on. I include many different types of exercises. 
Some are fill-in-the-blanks. Others are more involved, giving you the chance to edit or 
compose different types of communications, such as business letters and e-mails. 
This book can help you learn everything you need to confidently compose and read 
higher-level communications.
Remember that this book is a reference tool that doesn’t have to be read from cover 
to cover. Instead, you can just review the topics that you need to know about — when 
you need to know about them. Check out the Table of Contents or the Index to find 
the topic you’re interested in. Feel free to bounce around the book and skip any of 
the chapters that don’t pertain to you (such as the chapter on the alphabet if you 
already know how to read and write it). The beauty of this book is that each chapter 
is a self-contained unit that doesn’t assume knowledge of the others.

Intermediate Arabic For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you easily digest the information that you see in this book, I use the following 
conventions:
 
 All Arabic words and examples are presented in both Arabic script and English 
transliteration. The English transliteration is in bold.
 
 English translations of Arabic examples, both individual words and sentences, 
are italicized.
 
 Arabic doesn’t have capital letters like English does. Because the transliteration 
method makes use of some capital letters to distinguish among Arabic sounds, 
the transliteration also won’t be automatically capitalized.
 
 Answer Keys are provided at the end of each chapter. That way you don’t lose 
time searching in the back of the book for specific exercises.
 
 I use several abbreviations throughout the book. Most of them are pretty 
intuitive:
 
• F (feminine)
 
• M (masculine)
 
• S (singular)
 
• P (plural)
 
 To reduce clutter in the writing, I follow the common convention of not writing 
redundant vowels in my Arabic. Because there’s always a (  ﹶfatHa) preceding 
a ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa), I don’t write out the (  ﹶfatHa). I also don’t write the (  ﹶfatHa) 
or (  ﹾsukuun) of the definite article ‘( ﺍﻝalif laam). After all, those sounds can 
always be assumed. I do, however, always write a (  ﹼshadda) over a sun letter 
following the ‘( ﺍﻝalif laam). (To discover more about the vowels, see Chapter 3. 
For an exploration of the ‘( ﺍﻝalif laam), go to Chapter 2.)
 
 I don’t always include the formal and final vowels on nouns in the examples and 
exercises in this book because they usually aren’t pronounced in formal media 
sources. Chapters that focus on learning the formal and final vowels will, of 
course, comprehensively include them.
Foolish Assumptions
As someone interested in learning an intermediate level of Arabic, I assume that your 
basic or beginning knowledge includes the following:
 
 You have personal motivations for advancing to the next level in your Arabic.
 
 You don’t want a book that’s just a grammar textbook. You know where to find 
those. You’re after something that introduces a few important topics in each 
chapter and then covers them fully.

3
 Introduction
 
 You have experience with the fundamentals of Arabic grammar. This includes 
knowing the present, future, and past tenses of the verb. You understand the 
rules for making a noun definite and for constructing simple ’iDaafas. You’re also 
familiar with the more common prepositions and particles of Arabic. If you’re a 
bit rusty on any of these topics, don’t worry — Chapters 1 and 2 give you the 
chance to review those things.
However, I don’t assume that you know how to read and write in the Arabic alphabet. 
In fact, if you learned your beginning Arabic from Arabic For Dummies by Amine 
Bouchentouf (Wiley), you know that the alphabet wasn’t included there. Not includ-
ing this information allowed you to concentrate instead on speaking ability. But if you 
haven’t studied the Arabic alphabet yet, you need to master it before you can con-
sider yourself at the intermediate level. In Chapter 3, I help you learn it in a thorough 
and engaging way. In the meantime, all exercises and lessons include Arabic script 
and English transliteration for you to get started improving your Arabic right away.
How This Book Is Organized
Intermediate Arabic For Dummies is divided into six parts. The parts begin with the 
basics of the language and the alphabet and continue through exploration of the 
nouns, verbs, and particles. Each part has at least two chapters where you can dis-
cover the topic of that part in depth. Here’s how the various parts break down.
Part I: Polishing Your Arabic Skills
In this part, you review the alphabet, the numbers, and other words necessary to 
express things like dates and time in Arabic. I also provide you with a grammar 
review in case it has been a while since you studied to your basic level. I also show 
you how to use both the dictionaries included in this book as well as the larger ones 
you may acquire. Finally, I include a chapter on reading and writing the Arabic 
alphabet.
Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns
The chapters in this part present several topics necessary for an intermediate level 
command of nouns. You learn the three cases of the noun, and you meet the mystify-
ing types of broken plurals. You also get the info you need to confidently coordinate 
complicated ’iDaafa strings and add in adjectives. I round out this part with a chapter 
that helps you become a master at adding pronouns and relative clauses to your 
writing.
Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs
In Part III, you discover how to write with every imaginable type of verb. First I intro-
duce all ten forms of the Arabic verb and show you how to produce them when you 

4
Intermediate Arabic For Dummies 
throw in the irregular stems. Then you discover how to create commands and put 
objects on your verbs. The final chapter in this part introduces the various moods of 
the verb and demonstrates their uses in complicated constructions.
Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles
If you’re looking to make your writing even more sophisticated, this is the part for 
you. It equips you to use any of the dozens of particles in Arabic to join clauses, form 
conditional sentences, and enliven your writing with the use of the verbal noun and 
participles. This part also explains how to negate your sentences.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part give you further hints and help you improve your ability to 
write in the Arabic language. I show you ten common mistakes to steer clear of, and I 
provide ten tips to polish your Arabic writing. 
Part VI: Appendixes
The last part of this book provides you with valuable references. You get a full chart 
that shows you how to produce all forms of the Arabic verb. You also get English-
Arabic and Arabic-English dictionaries to use in completing the exercises throughout 
the book.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you navigate the chapters in this book, I use tiny pictures, called icons, in the 
margins. These icons help you spot particularly important or potentially troublesome 
concepts. The following icons appear in this book:
 
I use this icon whenever I introduce something that you should keep in mind while 
practicing your Arabic.
 
This icon highlights information that can provide you with another angle when trying 
to understand a particular point. These tips can save you time and frustration.
 
This icon points to differences between English and Arabic. The information high-
lighted with this icon can help you learn, because it lets you compare how your 
native language is similar to or different from Arabic. Comparing languages can be a 
powerful way to enhance your memory.

5
 Introduction
 
When you see this icon, it means that there’s a common error to be found nearby. 
Trust me, I’ve made them all. Hopefully, I’ve made them (and kept track of them) so 
you won’t have to.
 
This icon highlights the practice exercises, which help to reinforce the text I cover. 
These exercises are a good opportunity to improve your Arabic. I’ve even tried to 
make them fun.
Where to Go from Here
From here on out, dig in and follow your instincts! If you start a chapter and find that 
it just isn’t what you want to concentrate on, skip to something else. In my own lan-
guage studies, I’ve had days when I just didn’t want to concentrate on verb forms. 
Instead, I was hungry for some grammatical information. A week later, I couldn’t get 
enough of verbs. I’m giving you a wide variety of things to master. Whatever you do, I 
urge you to never rush your studies. Working regularly for a little while is better than 
cramming in hours of study in one sitting once a month.
If I can, I’d like to give you a little advice: Complete all the exercises! There’s nothing 
like committing yourself to putting down an answer on paper to force you to see 
where you need more study. Don’t be afraid of making errors. You’ve probably 
already seen that native speakers of Arabic are ever appreciative of your efforts. As 
you advance to the use of more intermediate concepts, errors are unavoidable, but 
the rewards are great. !( ﺣﹶﻈﹼﺎﹰ ﺳﹶﻌﻴﺪﺍﹰHaDHDHan sa3iidan! Good luck!)

Polishing Your 
Arabic Skills

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in Part I help you refresh your basic 
knowledge of Arabic and boost your confidence as you 
work to improve your writing skills. I offer you a quick 
review of the cardinal and ordinal numbers and how 
they’re used to tell time and express dates. I also give you 
a quick refresher on the basic Arabic grammatical issues, 
such as nouns, pronouns, possessive suffixes, verbs, and 
the main types of Arabic sentences. Also in this part is a 
chapter on how to read and write the Arabic alphabet. 
This is essential knowledge if you don’t already have it. 
With the information in this part, you’ll be bravely tread-
ing into the more advanced parts of the book in no time.

Chapter 1
Looking at Numbers, Times, and Dates
In This Chapter
 Mastering the Arabic cardinal and ordinal numbers
 Telling time using two methods
 Expressing dates in Arabic
C
atullus said, “Give me a thousand kisses.” And Elizabeth Barrett Browning 
declared, “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” Obviously, even the lan-
guage of love can’t get by without numbers! In fact, numbers and all the ways you 
need to use them are so important that they deserve to start off this brief review of 
basic Arabic. Besides telling that special someone when you’d like to see them again 
(for example, at 3 o’clock tomorrow or on Tuesday, March 4th, at 5:17 p.m.), people 
use numbers in commerce and for making appointments in all matters formal and 
mundane.
This chapter reviews the basics surrounding numbers and their use in making 
appointments and telling time. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be using numbers 
comfortably and confidently. I can’t promise that you’ll be able to avoid setting a 
lunch date with that boring office mate, but at least you’ll know how much your half 
of the bill is!
Focusing on Arabic Numbers
Numbers come in two forms in almost every language. The most common form is 
called the cardinal number. You use cardinal numbers when you look at a price tag or 
do your taxes. In other words, you use these types of numbers for any type of count-
ing. The second type of number is called the ordinal number, which allows you to 
rank something. For example, you may want to tell a client that you work on the 
fourth floor.
In the following sections, I give you the lowdown on both cardinal and ordinal num-
bers. I also introduce you to Arabic numerals, which are important because, as in 
English, you use them as a handy way to refer to numbers without writing out the 
whole word. I mean, after all, we call it the “War of 1812,” not the “War of Eighteen 
Twelve.”

Cardinal numbers: The digits you count with
Cardinal numbers are the ones that you use constantly in life, so they deserve to be 
considered ahead of the ordinals. If you haven’t yet mastered the basic forms of car-
dinal numbers, now would be a great time to do so. In Table 1-1, I show you many of 
the Arabic cardinal numbers.
 
Many Arabic numbers have both a masculine and a feminine form (which I discuss 
later in this section), so I list both forms where necessary in the table. In this chart, 
I display the words in Arabic and English transliteration without any of the case end-
ings (see Chapter 4 for more on the forms of the cases), with the exception of the 
numbers 11–19, which invariably have a (  ﹶfatHa) ending.

Dealing with gender in cardinal numbers
 
English has one gender-neutral form for each of the cardinal numbers. Arabic, how-
ever, has masculine and feminine forms (refer to Chapter 2 for more on gender of 
nouns). One of the maddening aspects of Arabic numbers is the strange practice of 
reverse gender agreement. In other words, the numbers that look similar to feminine 
nouns or adjectives are the ones you use with masculine nouns (and vice versa). Here 
are two examples of plural nouns with reverse gender agreement:
( ﺛﹶﻼﺙ ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺍﺕthalaath sayyaaraat; three cars)
( ﺧﹶﻤﹾﺴﺔ ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝkhamsa rijaal; five men)
As you can see, ( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺍﺕsayyaaraat; cars) is feminine, but it takes the masculine-
appearing form of the number. Similarly, ( ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝrijaal; men) is masculine but it takes 
the feminine-appearing form. So you need to know the gender of the noun you want 
to count. Then all you have to do is select the appropriate number from the list I pro-
vide you.
Putting two-digit numbers in the correct order
 
Another difference between English and Arabic is the order of two-digit numbers. 
After 20, English puts the second digit after the first, joining them with a hyphen. For 
example, you would write twenty-three. Arabic, on the other hand, puts the second 
digit first and joins the two numbers with the word ( ﻭﹶwa; and). Here’s an example: 
 ( ﺛﹶﻼﺛﺔ ﻭﹶﻋﹺﺸﹾﺮﻭﻥﹶthalaatha wa-3ishruuna), which translates to twenty-three.
Writing about one of something
To say there’s one of something, such as one house or one woman, the number must 
follow the noun and agree in gender and case (see Chapter 2 for more on gender and 
Chapter 4 for more on case). Note: In this section and the others that follow, I under-
line the numbers themselves to help you explore the examples. The following exam-
ple shows you a masculine and a feminine noun accompanied by the number one in 
Arabic:
( ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺖﹲ ﻭﺍﺣﹺﺪﹲbaytun waaHidun; one house)
’( ﺇﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶﺓﹲ ﻭﺍﺣﹺﺪﺓﹲimra’atun waaHidatun; one woman)
Writing about two of something
If you want to talk about two of something in Arabic (two pens or two letters, per-
haps), you have two options. The first option is to use the dual form of the noun. 
(Chapter 4 explains the dual form.) If you use the dual form of the noun, you won’t 
even be using a separate word for two. The ending of the noun itself will indicate that 
there are two of whatever you’re talking about. Here are a masculine and a feminine 
noun with the dual endings underlined:
( ﻗﹶﻠﹶﻤﺎﻥﹺqalamaani; two pens)
( ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺrisaalataani; two letters)

 Chapter 1: Looking at Numbers, Times, and Dates 13
Your other option is to use the dual form with the number two following (agreeing in 
gender and case, of course). You would use this option if you were trying to empha-
size the fact that you’re talking about two of something. You might need to emphasize 
the number to dispel a misunderstanding. If someone thought there were three books 
on the table, you could correct them, saying:
.ﻻ. ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺑﺎﻥﹺ ﺇﺛﹾﻨﺎﻥﹺ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﻭﹺﻟﹶﺔﹺ
(laa. hunaaka kitaabaani ’ithnaani 3alaa-T-Taawilati. No. There are two books 
on the table.)
Take a look at these two nouns that have the number two in Arabic added for 
emphasis:

( ﻃﺎﻭﹺﻟﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺ ﺇﹺﺛﹾﻨﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺTaawilataani ’ithnataani; two tables)
Writing about three to ten of something
When you’re speaking about three to ten of something, you first write the number 
using the form that appears to be the opposite gender of the noun that you want 
to count. (When most folks speak Modern Standard Arabic — and even when they 
write it — they don’t usually use the formal final vowels that can appear with the 
counted nouns.) Then you write the noun in its indefinite genitive plural form (refer 
to Chapter 4 for more on this form). Look closely at these examples of genitive plural 
nouns following numbers:
’( ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺑﹶﻌﺔ ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝﹴarba3at rijaalin; four men)
( ﺳﹶﺒﹾﻊﹶ ﻣﹶﺠﹶﻼﹼﺕﹴsab3a majallaatin; seven magazines)
 
Throughout this section, I tell you what the formal ending after the numbers is. I even 
show you the formal final vowels in my examples so you can become accustomed to 
them. But if you drop them from your speech and writing, you’ll still be correct. So 
that you can see what the same examples would be without the formal final vowels, 
here they are:
’( ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺑﹶﻌﺔ ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝarba3at rijaal; four men)
( ﺳﹶﺒﹾﻊﹶ ﻣﹶﺠﹶﻼﹼﺕsab3a majallaat; seven magazines)
Writing about eleven to ninety-nine of something
To count things between eleven and ninety-nine, you have to put the noun that’s fol-
lowing the number in the indefinite accusative singular form (see Chapter 4). Here are 
some examples of indefinite accusative singular nouns following their numbers:
( ﺗﹺﺴﹾﻊﹶ ﻋﹶﺸﹶﺮﺓ ﺟﹶﺮﻳﺪﹶﺓﹰtis3a 3asharat jariidatan; nineteen newspapers)
’( ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺑﹶﻌﻮﻥﹶ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻣﺎﹰarba3uuna yawman; forty days)

Writing about hundreds or thousands of something
When you talk about things occurring in even multitudes of hundreds or thousands, 
you write your number and use the indefinite genitive singular noun after it (see 
Chapter 4). Check out these examples:
’( ﺃﹶﻟﹾﻒ ﺩﻭﻻﺭﹴalf duulaarin; a thousand dollars)
( ﺛﹶﻼﺛﹸﻤﹺﺌﹶﺔﹺ ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞﹴ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺇﺳﹾﺒﺎﺭﹾﻃﺔthalaathumi’ati rajulin min ’isbaarTa; three hundred 
men from Sparta)
Writing about even multiples of ten
The multitudes of ten have two different forms, depending on whether the number is 
being used in the nominative or accusative/genitive cases. You can learn more about 
the cases and when you use them in Chapter 4. To produce the accusative/genitive 
form of the multiples of ten, you just have to change the ( ﻭﻥﹶ-uuna) ending into an  ﻳﻦﹶ
(-iina) ending. Here are the nominative and accusative/genitive forms of twenty in 
Arabic:
( ﻋﹺﺸﹾﺮﻭﻥﹶ3ishruuna; twenty; nom.)
( ﻋﹺﺸﹾﺮﻳﻦﹶ3ishriina; twenty; acc./gen.)
Writing numbers with three or more digits
In Arabic, when stating numbers that have three or more digits, you write the highest 
digit first and work your way down, adding the word and between number sets. Take 
a look at the following two multiple-digit numbers. This is how the number 5,678 
would be rendered in English according to Arabic style: Five thousand, and six hun-
dred, and eight and seventy. As you can see, with the exception of the way Arabic 
expresses seventy-eight, this is how we state large numbers in English as well.
Here are a few more examples:
( ﺛﹶﻼﺛﹸﻤﹺﺌﺔ ﻭﹶﺧﹶﻤﹾﺴﺔ ﻭﹶﺳﹺﺘﹼﻮﻥﹶthalaathumi’a wa-khamsa wa-sittuuna; 365)
( ﺛﹶﻼﺛﺔ ﺁﻻﻑ ﻭﹶﺧﹶﻤﹾﺴﹸﻤﹺﺌﺔ ﻭﹶﺳﹺﺘﹼﺔ ﻭﹶﺗﹺﺴﹾﻌﻮﻥﹶthalaathat ’aalaaf wa-khamsumi’a wa-
sitta wa-tis3uuna; 3,596)
 
Sometimes you need to write about a counted number in the definite state. For 
instance, you may need to discuss the set of five questions your boss asked you to 
answer. To do this in Arabic, just put the number after the noun and add the definite 
article to both. Reverse gender agreement still applies in this case. Here are two 
examples for you:
.ﻓﹶﻜﱠﺮﹾﺕﹸ ﺑﹺﺎﻷﹶﺳﹾﺌﹺﻠﺔ  ﺍﻟﺨﹶﻤﹾﺴﺔ
(fakkartu bil-’as’ila al-khamsa. I thought about the five questions.)
.ﻣﹶﺮﱠﺕﹾ ﺍﻷﹶﻳﹼﺎﻡﹸ ﺍﻟﻤﹺﺌﹶﺔﹸ ﺳﹶﺮﻳﻌﺎﹰ
(marrat al-’ayyaamu al-mi’atu sarii3an. The hundred days passed quickly.)

Ordinal numbers: The numbers 
you rank things with
Ordinal numbers aren’t quite as common in ordinary use (forgive the pun). But you 
need to use them whenever you express things that occur in an order or series. In a 
hotel, for instance, you may discover that your room is on the fifth floor. Or you may 
be considered first in your class. Table 1-2 shows you the ordinal numbers (through 
12) in Arabic. I explain what to do with numbers above 12 later in the section.

To properly use ordinals in Arabic, remember that ordinal numbers are adjectives. 
You have to choose the form that matches the gender of the noun it modifies. The fol-
lowing examples show both masculine and feminine nouns:
( ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞ ﺍﻟﻌﺎﺷﹺﺮar-rajul al-3ashir; the tenth man)
( ﺍﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺘﹼﺎﺳﹺﻌﺔas-saa3a at-taasi3a; the ninth hour [9 o’clock])
 
No abbreviation exists in Arabic to turn a cardinal into an ordinal like in English, 
when you write 1st and 3rd.
In Arabic, for any ordinal above 12, all you have to do is use the cardinal form. Take a 
look at the following example, which is a big number without a separate ordinal form:
( ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺮﹼﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﹺﻠﹾﻴﻮﻥal-marra al-milyuun; the millionth time)

Suppose that you’re reading an Arabic newspaper, and you come across a food crit-
ic’s ratings of some local eating establishments. She lists them in her order of prefer-
ence, like this:

the list and write the ranking in ordinal numbers on the line provided.

Arabic numerals: The symbols 
you write numbers with
In addition to the Arabic cardinal and ordinal numbers themselves (which I discuss 
earlier in this chapter), you also need to know the forms of the Arabic numerals (the 
symbols used to depict numbers). They’re called Arabic numerals because the 
Europeans borrowed them from the Arabs and acknowledged their source. The Arabs, 
however, actually borrowed them originally from India. Here are zero through nine in 
Arabic numerals (notice that a couple of them do resemble their Western counter-
parts; others, not so much):
  ( ٠0)
  ( ١1)
  ( ٢2)
  ( ٣3)
  ( ٤4)
  ( ٥5)
  ( ٦6)
  ( ٧7)
  ( ٨8)
  ( ٩9)
For numbers ten and higher, just combine the Arabic numerals from the chart above 
and use the same order you would for English. Here you can see a few larger 
numbers:
( ٢٤٩١1942)
( ٨٠٠٢2008)
 
Arabic uses a comma where English uses a decimal point. And Arabic doesn’t usually 
separate large numbers the way English does with the comma. Consider these 
examples:
( ٠٠٠٠٠٠١1,000,000)
( ٥,٣3.5)
 
As financial officer for your company, you need to fill out checks for several pur-
chases. The amounts are in ( ﺩﻳﻨﺎﺭdinaars) — the unit of currency used in many Arab 
countries, such as Bahrain and Iraq — but they have been given to you as English 
numerals. To do your job properly, first convert them into Arabic numerals and then 
write the Arabic numeral and the number itself, in Arabic. For the purpose of the 
exercise, use the masculine forms of the numbers.

Discovering How to Tell Time the Arabic Way
Time flies when you’re having fun. It drags when you’re looking forward to something 
later. And like money, it seems we never have quite enough of it. Because telling time 
is such a major part of our lives, knowing how to tell time and write it correctly is 
another one of those necessary skills in life.
 
In English you ask, “What time is it?” Someone asking you the time in Arabic will say 
( ﻛﹶﻢ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔkam as-saa3a). Literally, this translates as “How much is the hour?” 
 
Arabic has two methods of telling time, one of which shows a better command of lan-
 
guage. I explain both in this section.
Before you can tell time, however, here are a few words that you need to know:
( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔas-saa3a; the hour [o’clock])
( ﺩﹶﻗﻴﻘﺔdaqiiqa; minute)
( ﺩﹶﻗﺎﺋﹺﻖdaqaa’iq; minutes)
( ﻧﹺﺼﹾﻒniSf; half [to indicate 30 minutes])
( ﺭﹸﺑﹾﻊrub3; a quarter [to indicate 15 minutes])
( ﺛﹸﻠﹾﺚthulth; a third [to indicate 20 minutes])
( ﺻﹶﺒﺎﺣﺎﹰSabaaHan; in the morning)
( ﻣﹶﺴﺎﺀﹰmasaa’an; in the evening)

 Chapter 1: Looking at Numbers, Times, and Dates 19
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﻼﹰlaylan; at night)
( ﻇﹸﻬﹾﺮﺍﹰdhuhran; afternoon)
To tell time in Arabic, you replace the cardinal number with the correct ordinal form. 
Because ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔas-saa3a), the Arabic word for hour, is a feminine noun, you select 
the feminine forms of the ordinal. The only exception is that you use the feminine 
form of the cardinal ( ﻭﺍﺣﹺﺪﺓwaaHida) for 1:00.
To express the number of minutes on the hour up to the 30-minute mark, you add  ﻭﹶ
(wa), followed by the number of minutes in cardinal form. ( ﻭﹶwa) translates to and in 
English. You can use ( ﺭﹸﺑﹾﻊrub3) for a quarter hour (15 minutes), ( ﺛﻠﹾﺚthulth) for 20
min utes, and ( ﻧﹺﺼﹾﻒniSf) for the half hour (30 minutes). The following examples 
show you how to use these fractions to tell time:
4:30 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﹶﻟﺮﹼﺍﺑﹺﻌﺔ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻨﱢﺼﹾﻒas-saa3a ar-raabi3a wa-n-niSf; liter-
ally the hour the fourth and the half)
2:15 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﹶﻟﺜﹼﺎﻧﹺﻴﺔ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﺮﱡﺑﹾﻊas-saa3a ath-thaaniya wa-r-rub3; liter-
ally the hour the second and the quarter)
 
To state more complex times, you write the hour, followed by more specific minutes.  
For one or two minutes, you can just use the singular and dual forms of the word min-
 
ute, ( ﺩﹶﻗﻴﻘﺔdaqiiqa) and ( ﺩﹶﻗﻴﻘﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺdaqiiqataani). For more than two minutes, you use 
 
the cardinal number, followed by the plural form of minute, ( ﺩﹶﻗﺎﺋﹺﻖdaqaa’iq). Here are 
 
examples of one, two, and seven minutes past an hour:
9:01 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺘﹼﺎﺳﹺﻌﺔ ﻭﹶﺩﹶﻗﻴﻘﺔas-saa3a at-taasi3a wa-daqiiqa; liter-
ally the hour the ninth and a minute)
7:02 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﺎﺑﹺﻌﺔ ﻭﹶﺩﹶﻗﻴﻘﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺas-saa3a as-saabi3a wa-daqi-
iqataani; literally the hour the seventh and two minutes)
3:07 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﹶﻟﺜﹼﺎﻟﹺﺜﺔ ﻭﹶﺳﹶﺒﹾﻊ ﺩﹶﻗﺎﺋﹺﻖas-saa3a ath-thaalitha wa-sab3 
daqaa’iq; literally the hour the third and seven minutes)
 
If the time you want to write is after the half hour, you can write that it’s half past an  
hour, and then just add another number as necessary. For example, the time 6:35 
 
translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﺩﹺﺳﺔ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻨﱢﺼﹾﻒ ﻭﹶﺧﹶﻤﹾﺲﹶ ﺩﹶﻗﺎﺋﹺﻖas-saa3a as-saadisa wa-n-niSf 
 
wa-khamsa daqaa’iq; literally the hour the sixth and a half and five minutes).
There comes a point, however, when it becomes easier to talk about how many min-
utes there are until the next hour. The times 3:55 and 2:45 are both close enough to 
the next hour that it’s convenient to use ’( ﺇﹼﻻillaa), which in English is except (but 
here it’s the equivalent of to in the sense of “a quarter to four”). After ’( ﺇﹼﻻillaa), you 
use the accusative form of the noun or number. Consider the following examples:
3:55 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺮﹼﺍﺑﹺﻌﺔ ﺇﹼﻻ ﺧﹶﻤﹾﺲﹶ ﺩﹶﻗﺎﺋﹺﻖas-saa3a ar-raabi3a ’illaa 
khamsa daqaa’iq; literally the hour the fourth except five minutes)
2:45 translates to ( ﺍﹶﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺜﹼﺎﻟﹺﺜﺔ ﺇﹼﻻ ﺭﹸﺑﻌﺎﹰas-saa3a ath-thaalitha ’illaa rub3an; 
literally, the hour the third except a quarter)

Making Dates: Getting to Know 
the Arabic Days and Months
Whether they’re dreaded deadlines or anniversaries that you don’t want to forget, 
knowing dates is a critical skill in any language. In this section, I prepare you for writ-
ing out some dates in Arabic by presenting some important categories of words: days 
of the week and months in a year.
Before you begin, however, check out some useful words for talking about dates:
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡyawm; day)
’( ﺃﹸﺳﹾﺒﻮﻉusbuu3; week)
( ﺷﹶﻬﹾﺮshahr; month)

 Chapter 1: Looking at Numbers, Times, and Dates 21
( ﺳﹶﻨﺔsana; year)
( ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡal-yawm; today)
’( ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺamsi; yesterday)
( ﻏﹶﺪﺍﹰghadan; tomorrow)
Exploring the days of the week
The days of the week in Arabic are easy to remember because most of them are 
based on numbers, with Sunday being number one (it’s the first day of the week, after 
all). When you get to the end, the word for Friday means “Gathering Day,” because it’s 
the main prayer day for Muslims. Saturday preserves the Hebrew word “Sabbath.”
Here are the days of the week in Arabic:
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻷﹶﺣﹶﺪyawm al-’aHad; Sunday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻹﹶﺛﹾﻨﹶﻴﹾﻦﹺyawm al-’ithnayni; Monday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻟﺜﱡﻼﺛﺎﺀyawm ath-thulathaa’; Tuesday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻷﹶﺭﹾﺑﹶﻌﺎﺀyawm al-’arba3aa’; Wednesday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻟﺨﹶﻤﻴﺲyawm al-khamiis; Thursday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻟﺠﹸﻤﹾﻌﺔyawm al-jum3a; Friday)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻟﺴﹶﺒﹾﺖyawm as-sabt; Saturday)
 
Whether you’re speaking or writing, it isn’t uncommon to save time by dropping off 
 
the word ( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡyawm) and just state the second element. In other words,  ﺍﻟﺨﹶﻤﻴﺲ
 
(al-khamiis) can mean Thursday all on its own.
Remembering the months of the year
Most of the Arab world today uses the Gregorian calendar with names for the months 
borrowed from the Western world. An ancient Semitic system of names, which dates 
back more than 3,000 years, has also been preserved. In many Arabic language news-
papers, you see the Western month, followed by the ancient Semitic months in paren-
theses. In Table 1-3, I provide you with the Western months in Arabic along with their 
ancient Semitic equivalents and Western translations.

Writing full dates with the day, 
month, and year
To find out the date in Arabic, you can ask someone, ( ﻣﺎ ﺍﻟﺘﹼﺎﺭﻳﺦmaa at-taariikh? 
What’s the date?). The response, as in English, can be in either cardinal or ordinal 
numbers. Here are examples of a date with a cardinal number and one with an 
ordinal:
( ﺍﻟﻌﹺﺸﹾﺮﻭﻥﹶ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺃﹶﺑﹾﺮﻳﻞal-3ishruuna min ’abriil; April 20)
( ﺍﻷﹶﻭﱠﻝ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻳﹶﻨﺎﻳﹺﺮal-’awwal min yanaayir; January 1st)
 
To write a date in Arabic, you reverse the order of the month and day that you use in 
English. For example, January 14, 2008, in English, becomes 14 January, 2008, in Arabic.
Here’s where your knowledge of the Arabic numerals is going to come in handy. To 
write a date in Arabic numerals, you can do one of two things: You can put the whole 
thing in numerals and separate them with back slashes, or you can write out the 
month in Arabic (with the rest in numerals). The following examples show you how to 
write January 15, 2008, using both options:
( ٥١ﻳﹶﻨﺎﻳﹺﺮ ٨٠٠٢yanaayir) / ٥١/١/ ٨٠٠٢

 love languages and have studied a good number of them. No matter how familiar I 
become with a language, however, I still find it valuable to go back and review the 
basics every now and then. In so doing, sometimes I discover new and better ways to 
remember things that have long plagued me. So, no matter how recently you com-
pleted your basic studies in Arabic (and I’m assuming you have already completed at 
least a year’s worth of studies and are about to take or are currently in an intermedi-
ate level course), a refresher will help you as you move on.
If you’re a bit rusty, this chapter can reinvigorate your knowledge of some things I 
don’t cover elsewhere in this book. In the remaining chapters, I go beyond the mate-
rial reviewed here, which is the reason you picked up Intermediate Arabic For 
Dummies in the first place.
In this chapter, you encounter a description of what the Arabic triliteral root is and 
how it works. You experience the many ways that nouns can function in your sen-
tence. This chapter also acquaints you with how to add the Arabic definite article, 
the equivalent of English the, to your nouns. You see how to describe possession in 
Arabic, and you have the chance to review past, present, and future tense verbs. 
Finally, you discover the two main types of Arabic sentences.
This is a lot to cover, but gaining the skills from the material in this chapter provides 
you with a sound foundation. And this foundation will help you become proficient at 
the intermediate level.

Understanding How the Arabic Triliteral 
Root System Impacts Nouns
As you likely learned in the first semester of your first year of Arabic studies, the vast 
majority of Arabic words are derived from a root that’s made of three consonants. 
Each of these three-consonant roots are referred to as a triliteral root. (This name 
comes from the Latin for, you guessed it, three letters.) Thousands of different trilit-
eral roots exist in Arabic. It’s important to know about these triliteral roots because 
Arabic uses them in stable word patterns to form almost every noun and verb in the 
language.
A triliteral root has an inherent meaning. For example, consider the triliteral root ( ﻛﺘﺐk-t-b). This root means to write. Arabic uses the three consonants of the root 
k-t-b in different word patterns, each of which (because of the root meaning) will have 
something to do with the concept of writing.
 
Grammarians model word patterns in Arabic with a sort of “dummy” root, ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l). 
The root f-3-l means to do, but when it’s used to model word patterns, don’t think 
about its meaning at all. Instead, view the use of f-3-l to show patterns as a sort of 
blueprint. The three consonants of the root f-3-l show you where the three conso-
nants of any triliteral root will go when you use the word pattern in question.
In the following example, I demonstrate how you use the root ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l) as the model 
for word patterns. These are the word patterns:
( ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻞﹶfa3ala; to do something)
( ﻣﹶﻔﹾﻌﹶﻞﹲmaf3alun; the place to do that something)
( ﻓﺎﻋﹺﻞﹲfaa3ilun; one who does that something)
Here are the same word patterns from the previous list with the triliteral root  ﻛﺘﺐ
(k-t-b), which means to write:
( ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺐﹶkataba; to write)
( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐﹲmaktabun; office, or place of writing)
( ﻛﺎﺗﹺﺐﹲkaatibun; writer)
As you make your way through this book and advance in your Arabic studies, you’ll 
become familiar with many productive word patterns that have stable meanings no 
matter what root you insert. Notice, for instance, how the words on the pattern 
faa3ilun mean one who does something. The words on the pattern maf3alun mean 
place [where the verb happens].
 
Now’s your chance to practice replacing the consonants of the dummy root f-3-l with 
another root. For each of the items below, I give you a word pattern using f-3-l and a 
new triliteral root. Your job is to substitute the consonants of f-3-l with the conso-
nants of the new root. This exercise gives you a little practice writing in Arabic (if 
you’re rusty on that important skill). You can also guess at the meaning of the word 
you create, based on the root meaning and the word pattern.

Naming People, Places, and Things: 
Nouns 101
As you know, a noun is the part of speech in a language that names people, places, 
things, or even more abstract concepts, such as qualities and actions. This section 
offers a brief refresher on noun basics. I present the various types of nouns you find 
within a sentence and explain what they are. I also discuss how the topic of gender fits 
with nouns in the Arabic language. (To read about the noun cases, visit Chapter 4.)
Exploring the types of Arabic nouns
As in English, nouns fall into several different categories. Here are the categories in 
which a noun can appear in Arabic:
 
 Animate: Included in this category are humans, real or imaginary, and animals 
(and some might add aliens!). Here’s an example:
 
 .ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﻭﹶﺳﻴﻢﹲ
 
( dhaalikaa-r-rajulu wasiimun. That man is handsome.)
 
 Thing: Here you have any inanimate object that you can see, touch, taste, or 
somehow feel. For example:
 
 .ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡﹶ ﺳﹶﺮﻳﻌﺎﹰ
 
’( akaltu aT-Ta3aama sarii3an. I ate the food quickly.)

Part I: Polishing Your Arabic Skills

 Proper noun: Whether it’s a person’s name or a place like New Jersey, a proper 
noun refers to something ordinarily capitalized in English (but Arabic has no 
capital letters). Check out this example:
 
 .ﺯﺍﺭﹶﺕﹾ ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻫﹺﺮﹶﺓﹶ
 
( zaarat al-qaahirata. She visited Cairo.)
 
 Abstract quality or concept: This broad category basically covers anything that 
doesn’t fit in the previous three categories. Some items that fall into this cate-
gory include feelings, concepts, and even actions. Consider this example:
 
 .ﺍﻟﺴﱡﻜﻮﺕ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺍﻟﺬﱠﻫﹶﺐ
 
( as-sukuut min adh-dhahab. Silence is golden.)
Engendering differences
An important feature of Arabic nouns is their gender. So in this section, I show you 
ways to recognize the gender of an Arabic noun.
 
English nouns may describe males and females, but there’s no grammatical gender 
for inanimate nouns or abstract concepts. So, John may be referred to as he and Mary 
as she, but the table is referred to as it. In Arabic, the pronoun it doesn’t exist. 
Instead, every noun is either masculine or feminine. When the noun is masculine, it 
takes masculine adjectives. When it’s feminine, feminine adjectives are the correct 
choice. (See Chapter 6 for more information on how adjectives and genders interact.)
Working with masculine nouns
In Arabic, two clues can tell you whether a noun is masculine. For instance, an Arabic 
noun is masculine if:
 
 The noun describes something intuitively masculine, such as a man, brother, or 
uncle.
 
 The noun doesn’t have the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa), which is the ordinary ending for a 
feminine noun.
As an example of the first rule, here are a couple of masculine nouns describing 
males:
( ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞrajul; man)
( ﺟﹶﺪﹼjadd; grandfather)
 
Unfortunately, Arabic has no masculine ending (as, for instance, you have with the 
Spanish word carro, meaning car). There’s nothing about a typical masculine noun 
that tells you it’s masculine except the fact that it doesn’t have the ( ﺓtaa’ mar-
buuTa). Here are a few examples of masculine nouns that aren’t intuitively masculine:

 Chapter 2: Arabic 101 Refresher 31
( ﻛﹶﺄﹾﺱka’s; glass)
( ﻫﺎﺗﹺﻒhaatif; telephone)
( ﻧﹺﻈﺎﻡniDHaam; system)
Getting girly with feminine nouns
In Arabic, two factors help you determine whether a noun is feminine. For instance, a 
noun is feminine if it:
 
 Describes something understood as feminine, such as a woman, an aunt, or a 
grandmother
 
 Ends with the regular feminine ending, the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa)
The following are examples of the first rule. These feminine nouns describe females in 
Arabic:
( ﺍﹺﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶﺓimra’a; woman)
( ﺑﹺﻨﹾﺖbint; girl, daughter)
And now here are examples of the second rule. These nouns that describe gender-
neutral objects are still feminine nouns in Arabic. You can guess that they’re feminine 
because of the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending.
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓsayyaara; car)
( ﺟﹶﺮﻳﺪﺓjariida; newspaper)
 
There are always exceptions to the rule, of course. There are a handful of nouns with ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) that are masculine. There are some nouns without it that are femi-
nine. And there’s no rhyme or reason to the few violations of the expected rules. So 
you have to look up words that you aren’t familiar with. Note that most comprehen-
sive dictionaries on the market only tell you the gender of nouns that violate the 
expected gender. I don’t use any of these rare irregular nouns in this book, but be on 
the lookout for them elsewhere.
 
In this practice set, I give you the chance to recognize the probable gender of a noun 
and add the appropriate form of the adjective. For each item, I give you the noun and 
a masculine adjective. Put the adjective after the noun. I don’t throw any curve balls 
at you in this exercise. The gender will be what you can and should safely assume.

Being Specific with the Definite State
The definite state is the form of a noun that refers to a specific example of that noun — 
not just any theoretical case. In other words, when you say that you saw the movie, 
you’re referring to a specific, or definite, movie. But if you ask someone whether they 
saw a movie on Friday night, you aren’t asking about a specific movie. Grammarians 
use the term definite state to refer to a noun that’s given some equivalent to the 
English word the, which is considered a definite article. A noun in English with the 
word the in front of it is considered to be in the definite state. By contrast, if you use 
the indefinite article a/an, you’re describing the indefinite state.
Arabic creates the definite state by adding the prefix ( ﺍﹶﻝal-) to a noun. Even though 
al- is a prefix on the word — not a separate word like the — grammarians still gener-
ally call al- the definite article. Because the definite article in Arabic is made up of just 
the two consonants ’( ﺍﹶalif) and ( ﻝlaam), Arab speakers and writers frequently refer 
to making a noun definite as “adding the ’alif laam.”
The following are two nouns that I make definite by adding the ’alif laam. In each case, 
I first show you the noun by itself and then the noun with the prefixed definite article:
( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏkitaab; a book)
( ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏal-kitaab; the book)
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓsayyaara; a car)
( ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓas-sayyaara; the car)
Notice that in the Arabic script, I have indeed added the ’alif laam to each noun. But 
with ( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓsayyaara), the definite version has no ( ﻝlaam) at all. Instead, you find a 
double s sound. This is because about half of the consonants in Arabic absorb the l 
sound of the laam and turn into a doubled consonant.
In the following sections, you discover how each consonant behaves when you add 
the ’alif laam to it. The Arabic consonants are classified as sun letters or moon let-
ters depending on what they do to the laam in the definite state.

 Chapter 2: Arabic 101 Refresher 33
The sun letters
Consonants that assimilate the laam of the ’alif laam are called sun letters. The reason
 they’re called this is because the first letter of the word for sun in Arabic,  ﺷﹶﻤﹾﺲﹲ
(shamsun), is a sun letter itself.
 
The assimilation of the laam to produce a doubled consonant is primarily a matter of 
pronunciation. In writing, you use the usual ’alif laam as the prefix to create the defi-
nite state. If, however, the first consonant of the word is one of the sun letters, you 
acknowledge the assimilation of the laam by writing a (  ﹼshadda), which is the symbol 
for a doubled consonant, above the sun letter itself. (If you’re uncertain about the 
shadda, you can review Arabic writing rules in Chapter 3.) What’s great about this in 
Arabic is that there’s a convenient way to visually recognize that a noun is definite, 
even if the pronunciation doesn’t have a laam with sun letters.
Table 2-1 displays each of the sun letters, along with a noun that begins with each.

The moon letters
The moon letters are those consonants that don’t assimilate the laam. Instead, 
with the moon letters, the ’alif laam goes onto the word as a simple prefix pro-
nounced al-. The reason they’re named as they are is that the first letter of the 
word for moon in Arabic, ( ﻗﹶﻤﹾﺮﹲqamrun), is a moon letter itself.
Table 2-2 displays each of the moon letters along with examples of words beginning 
with each of the moon letters.

Working with Pronouns and Pronoun Suffixes
Pronouns are words that can take the place of nouns. For instance, in English, you can 
say, “I saw my friend at the party and went with him to the buffet table. He ate all the 
breadsticks!” Instead of repeating the word friend, you can use pronouns to be more 
concise. In this example, you can see how English has separate pronouns for both 
subjects (he) and objects (him) of verbs.
 
English also has possessive pronouns. With possessive pronouns, you’re able to say 
“I attended his wedding” and “I know their secret.” While English has separate words 
for pronouns and possessive pronouns, Arabic only has separate, or independent, 
pronouns for the subjects of verbs. When you need to express a pronoun as the 
object of a verb or to express a possessive pronoun, you use pronoun suffixes on the 
nouns and verbs.
Discovering the independent 
forms of Arabic pronouns
An independent (or stand-alone) form of the Arabic pronoun is used when the pro-
noun is the subject of a verb or the main topic of an equational sentence. However, 
in a sentence with a verb, the pronouns aren’t strictly necessary, because the verb 
form itself also tells you who’s performing the action. But you can add the indepen-
dent forms of the Arabic pronoun to provide emphasis about who’s doing the action. 
(For example, you may want to make it very clear that “You need to take out the gar-
bage, not me.”)
 
In Arabic, when you’re talking to or about a group that has mixed gender, you use the 
masculine plural forms. You only use the feminine plural forms when talking to or 
about a group that’s composed of three or more female people.

Tacking on the possessive pronoun 
suffixes to Arabic nouns
 
Unlike English, Arabic doesn’t have separate possessive pronouns such as his, our, 
and their. Instead, Arabic has possessive pronouns that you attach as suffixes to the 
noun. (When you want to express possession of one full noun over another noun, you 
use the ’iDaafa construction covered later in this chapter.)
To form the possessive, you attach the proper possessive pronoun suffix to the noun 
without adding the ’alif laam to make it definite. After all, if I tell you that I like his 
car, I’m referring to a specific, or definite, car. You attach your pronouns to the noun 
after the case ending with only one exception — the suffix ( ﻱ-ii), which is used to 
express my.
In Table 2-4, I use the nominative case, but these possessive pronoun suffixes go on a 
noun in the accusative or genitive as well. (To see the cases covered in detail, you 
can go to Chapter 4 of this book.) In the table, you see the possessive suffixes added 
to the nouns after the normal u vowel of the nominative. In the exception, you remove 
the nominative ending u and add the suffix ( ﻱ-ii) directly to the noun. I show you 
how to apply the suffixes using the example noun ( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏkitaab; book).

When you put the possessive suffixes on a noun with the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) — the 
Arabic feminine ending that’s described earlier in the chapter — you change the taa’ 
marbuuTa into a ( ﺕtaa’). Then you add the usual endings. Consider the feminine 
noun ’( ﺇﺟﺎﺑﺔijaaba; answer). Here’s what it looks like with the possessive pronoun 
 
suffixes added:
’( ﺇﺟﺎﺑﹶﺘﻲijaabatii; my answer)
’( ﺇﺟﺎﺑﹶﺘﹸﻬﺎijaabatuhaa; her answer)
 
For each of the supplied English nouns and pronouns, add the possessive suffix in Arabic.

Getting Active with Arabic Verbs
Verbs are the words in a language that really make life exciting because they express 
action. One interesting thing you may have discovered is that Arabic manages to get 
by without using a verb that means to be in the present tense. So, instead of saying 
“I am happy,” you just say “I happy.” (You can explore sentences without the verb to 
be in the present tense in the later section “Adding up equational sentences.” But, 
don’t worry. Arabic has a rich inventory of ways to describe the other actions that 
spice up your life.
In Chapter 9, I introduce you to the ten forms of the Arabic verb. And Chapter 10 
helps you sort out the irregular verbs that can sometimes be troublesome. In this sec-
tion, however, you can review the formation of the past, present, and future tenses of 
simple and regular verbs.
Writing the past tense verb
 
I start with the past tense because Arabic dictionaries use the past tense form as the 
base word to show you any verb. Another good reason to start with it is because it’s 
easier than the present — you only have to add suffixes to form the past tense. (The 
present requires both prefixes and suffixes.) So I start you out easy with the past 
tense.
Simply put, the past tense describes actions or conditions that happened in the past. 
In Arabic, you express past tense by adding one of the many past tense personal pro-
noun suffixes to the verb. All verbs in Arabic use the same endings to produce the 
past tense. Table 2-5 shows the different personal pronoun suffixes that you use.

You don’t necessarily need to use the separate pronouns in addition to the verb since 
the suffixes of the past tense tell you who’s performing the action. Use the pronouns 
only if you want to emphasize who’s performing the action.
Creating the present tense verb
The present tense expresses action occurring in the present time. In Arabic, forming 
the present tense is a bit more complicated than forming the past tense. The main 
reason is because every verb in the present tense receives a prefix, but some also get 
a suffix. I explain the rules a little later in this section.
 
Before you can properly form the present tense of a verb, you need to look in the dic-
tionary to determine the vowel that goes over the second consonant of the verb. You 
can read more about these vowels in Chapter 3. You don’t have to worry about which 
vowel to choose, however; it’s predetermined. You just need to find out which one is 
correct in the dictionary. (And you’ll be able to find it easily since I give you the past 
and present tense of each verb. Whatever vowel you find following the second conso-
nant of the triliteral root in the present tense is the vowel you use for all the forms of 
the present.) Each verb uses only one of the three possible vowels: Damma, kasra, 
and fatHa. Table 2-6 shows examples of verbs using each of the three vowels.

Before I show you all the forms of the present tense, I need to describe the steps for 
generating the present tense verb. Here they are:
 
1. Attach the necessary prefix for each person of the verb to the first consonant.
 
 The first consonant won’t be followed by a vowel (you write a consonant without 
a vowel in Arabic by placing the [  ﹾsukuun] symbol over the consonant).
 
2. After the second consonant, add the vowel that the particular verb uses in the 
present tense.
 
 You can discover the correct vowel in your dictionary.
 
3. Add a Damma to the third consonant of the root.
 
 The following are exceptions to this rule:
 
• You (FS) takes the suffix ( ﻳﻦﹶ-iina).
 
• You (MP) and they (MP) take the suffix ( ﻭﻥﹶ-uuna).
 
• You (FP) and they (FP) take the suffix ( ﻥﹶ-na).
Table 2-7 shows the prefixes and suffixes that you must add to create the present 
tense.

Forming the future tense verb
If there were an Olympic event for the easiest way to form the future tense in a lan-
guage, Arabic would likely take the gold medal. All you have to do to write a verb in 
the future tense is add ( ﺳﹶsa) to the present tense form. How easy is that?
Following are the future tense forms of the verb, ( ﺷﹶﺮﹺﺏﹶshariba; to drink). Notice that 
the forms here are identical to the present tense forms except for the addition of the 
prefix ( ﺳﹶsa).

Producing the proper form of the verb is an important skill to master as you move on 
to the various forms and irregular verbs in the rest of the book. So be sure to take a 
run through this exercise before you begin. In the following sentences, each blank 
needs a verb. For clues, you get the root and vowel of the verb you need. To keep you 
from having to go to the dictionary, I give you the present tense vowel of each verb in 
parentheses. For the sake of the exercise, use past tense for anything in the past, 
present for anything today, and future for tomorrow.

Grasping Arabic Grammar Essentials
As you know, nouns are the things and verbs are the actions. Knowing how to put 
these items together is where you enter that often feared area of grammar. To com-
pare language to baking a cake, nouns and verbs alike are the ingredients you use. 
But grammar is the recipe that tells you the specific ways to combine those ingredi-
ents so you can produce something good. Grammar lets writers produce a work in a 
way that’s understandable (and hopefully enjoyable) to all.

 Chapter 2: Arabic 101 Refresher 43
In terms of their grammar, there are two main types of languages. One type relies on 
word suffixes or prefixes to determine what every part of speech is doing in the sen-
tence. We call these inflected languages. Latin is one of them; it has different endings 
for every possible function of the words. Another type of language is what’s called a 
word order language. English is a member of this class. In English, the subject comes 
before the verb and the object comes after.
Modern Standard Arabic is an inflected language that has developed into a word 
order language. What do I mean by that? Well, Arabic has case endings (which you 
can read about in Chapter 4) that tell you whether a noun is the subject or the object. 
However, because word order also tells you the subject and object, you can drop 
those endings out of your pronunciation without causing any loss of understanding. 
It isn’t surprising that all the modern dialects have abandoned the case endings.
In this section, I give you a brief overview of a few important grammatical issues in 
Arabic, including a description of the two types of sentences (equational and verbal) 
and an explanation of the ’iDaafa structure. Familiarity with these concepts equips 
you to expand your use of Arabic into the more complicated grammatical construc-
tions that are covered in Part IV of this book.
Adding up equational sentences
 
The most basic sentence in Arabic is one in which you write A [is] B. This type of 
sentence is known as an equational sentence. In Arabic, there’s no verb meaning to be 
in the present tense. Instead, it’s understood from the context. To give you an idea of 
how this works, I put the word to be in brackets in the English translation of the exam-
ples to remind you that this word is missing in the Arabic.
In the following examples, I show you the possible types of equational sentences. 
What they have in common is the lack of a present tense verb to be as well as the 
existence of two parts. The first part (A) is the subject. The subject could be a name, 
pronoun, or proper noun. The second part (B) is called the predicate. The predicate is 
the additional information your equational sentence imparts about the subject. That 
information could be in the form of an adjective (if you’re describing an attribute of 
the subject) or a proper noun or name.
Here’s an example of an equational sentence in which A could be a proper name and 
B could be another noun:
.ﻣﹸﺤﹶﻤﱠﺪ ﻣﹸﻬﹶﻨﹾﺪﹺﺱ
(Muhammad muhandis. Muhammad [is] an engineer.)
A could also be a noun and B could be a proper name, like this:
.ﺍﹺﺳﹾﻤﻲ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪ
(ismii ’aHmad. My name [is] Ahmad.)

Part I: Polishing Your Arabic Skills 
44
And, finally, A could be a pronoun and B could be an adjective, as in this example 
(which also adds a temporal adverb):
. ﺃﹶﻧﺎ ﺗﹶﻌﹾﺒﺎﻥ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡ
’(anaa ta3baan al-yawm. I [am] tired today.)
 
You can add the interrogative particle ( ﻫﹶﻞﹾhal) to an equational sentence to make it 
a question. There’s no direct English equivalent for hal; it just introduces a question. 
Consider this example:
ﻫﹶﻞ ﺃﹶﻧﹾﺖﹶ ﻣﹸﺘﹶﺄﹶﻛﱢﺪ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ؟
(hal ’anta muta’akkid min dhaalika? [Are] you sure about that?)
Creating action with verbal sentences
A verbal sentence contains a verb in the predicate. In a verbal sentence, the fact that a 
particular action took place or is taking place is an integral part of the information 
being conveyed. It may also be true that the verbal sentence tells you who’s doing the 
action or to whom the action is being done. Here’s an example of a verbal sentence:
.ﻧﺎﻡﹶ ﺍﻟﻜﹶﻠﹾﺐ ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹼﻡ
(naama al-kalb kulla-l-yawm. The dog slept all day.)
Here the word dog is the subject and slept is the verb. This sentence displays the nor-
mal word order you use in Arabic. The first word of the sentence is your verb. 
Immediately following your verb comes your subject. There’s no object to the verb. 
However, if your sentence requires you to add an object, you express the object 
immediately after the subject. For example, here’s a sentence with a subject, a verb, 
and an object:
.ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﹶﺖﹾ ﺍﻟﻘﹺﻄﹼﺔ ﺍﻟﻔﹶﺄﹾﺭ
’(akalat al-qiTTa al-fa’r. The cat ate the mouse.)
Here the word cat is the subject, ate is the verb, and, well, the mouse is the unfortu-
nate object.
Expressing possession with 
the ’iDaafa structure
An ’iDaafa is the grammatical construction used in Arabic to express possession of 
one noun over another. To form an ’iDaafa, you put two nouns next to each other, 
with the second noun possessing the first. Refer to Chapter 7 for help on perfecting 
your use of complicated and long ’iDaafas. For now, I keep it simple and just go over 
the two-word ’iDaafa.

 Chapter 2: Arabic 101 Refresher 45
 
In English, you have two ways to express possession of one noun over another. You 
can use the word of, as in the phrase, the house of Ahmad. You can also use the pos-
sessive suffix ’s, as in Ahmad’s house. In Arabic, you express either one of these two 
 
English phrases with an ’iDaafa in which you put together the two words,  ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪ
(bayt ’aHmad; literally, house Ahmad).
 
One inviolable rule about the Arabic ’iDaafa is that the first word in the ’iDaafa can 
never take the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). If the second word is definite — it’s either a proper 
name like Ahmad or it’s a noun with the ’alif laam — the whole ’iDaafa is translated 
as if both members are definite. Here’s an example of an ’iDaafa with a noun in the 
definite state coming second. Notice that the translation renders both definite:
ﻣﹸﺴﺎﻋﹺﺪ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲ
(musaa3id ar-ra’iis; the assistant of the president or, the president’s assistant)
You see in the final example that when the first word in an ’iDaafa ends with the taa’ 
marbuuTa, you pronounce the word as if there’s a final t. In Arabic writing, however, 
there’s no difference in spelling.
 
The only way to master the ’iDaafa construction is by practicing extensively. So in 
the following exercise, I provide you with several English possessive phrases. 
Produce the indicated ’iDaafas in Arabic based on those English phrases.

Navigating Arabic Bilingual Dictionaries
Have you ever forgotten a word even in English? In that moment, you may tell a friend 
that there’s a word you need, and it’s right on the tip of your tongue. You use so 
many words every day that you’re bound to have difficulties even in your native lan-
guage. However, how much more frustrating it is to find yourself needing a word that 
you’ve never even learned! That’s where bilingual dictionaries come in.

Part I: Polishing Your Arabic Skills 
46
Consider the following common Arabic saying: .( ﺍﻟﻌﹶﺮﹶﺑﹺﻴﹼﺔ ﻣﹸﺤﻴﻂal-3arabiyya muHiiT. 
Arabic is an Ocean.). Arabic contains the largest number of native words of all other 
languages on the planet. (English has more words overall, but a majority of English 
words are borrowed from other languages.) So obviously, you need to know your way 
around a dictionary, whether it’s one in the back of this book or a separate Arabic-
English dictionary.
Using the dictionaries in the 
appendixes of this book
As you go through this book, you may need to consult the dictionaries in the appen-
dixes to complete the exercises. So to help you do that most efficiently, you need a lit-
tle guidance on how to use them. When you need to find the Arabic equivalent to an 
English word, look it up in the English-Arabic dictionary. You look it up alphabetically 
(according to the English word).
 
To help you distinguish between nouns and verbs, a verb is always given in the form 
of an infinitive (to + a verb). Compare the following two entries; the first one is a verb 
and the second a noun:
to answer: ’( ﺃﹶﺟﺎﺏﹶajaaba) / ( ﻳﹸﺠﻴﺐﹸyujiibu)
answer: ( ﺟﹶﻮﺍﺏjawaab) / ’( ﺃﹶﺟﹾﻮﹺﺑﺔajwiba)
For the Arabic-English dictionary, I include all forms alphabetically by the order of 
the Arabic alphabet — as opposed to listing words under their triliteral roots (which 
is how many other dictionaries are organized). If you’re unsure of the order of the 
Arabic alphabet, it’s included in the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book. This organi-
zation should help you more quickly locate the forms you need. When I give you a 
verb, I supply the present tense in parentheses along with the past tense. For nouns 
and adjectives, I give you the plural form in parentheses.
Finding your way through a regular 
Arabic-English dictionary
The main difference between the dictionaries you encounter in this book and many of 
the full dictionaries on the market is that many follow the convention of organizing by 
root rather than presenting each word alphabetically. In this book’s Arabic-English 
dictionary, you find the word ( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐmaktab; office) on the same page as  ﻣﹶﺼﹾﻨﹶﻊ
(maSna3; factory) because both start with m. In other full dictionaries, however, you 
would find ( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐmaktab; office) on the same page as ( ﻛﺎﺗﹺﺐkaatib; writer) because 
all the words formed from the root ( ﻛﺘﺐk-t-b; to write) are put together.
 
For a good alphabetical dictionary that’s organized the same way as the dictionaries 
in this book, try Al Mawrid (English-Arabic/Arabic-English dictionary) by Mounir 
Baalbaki. A good dictionary that’s organized by triliteral root is The Hans Wehr 
Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic.

any times, when native speakers of Arabic discover that I know how to speak 
their language, they ask me if I also know how to read and write it. When I tell 
them I do, they’re ordinarily more impressed (and even astounded) with the fact that 
I know the Arabic alphabet than with the fact that I know how to speak the language 
itself! This is because, for good or bad, the Arabic alphabet is a difficult matter.
If you have no background yet in how to read and write the Arabic script that you 
find in this book, you can still get started learning some intermediate level Arabic. 
This is because as an extra feature of this book, I include English transliteration for 
everything. But learning the alphabet still is essential for you if you intend to gain any 
depth in the language.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a straightforward presentation of each 
Arabic letter. I show you how to recognize and write each letter. I also explore how 
each consonant is pronounced and how to add vowels to your consonants.
Understanding the Basics 
of Writing Arabic Script
Arabic, as you probably know, is written from right to left. Arabic letters that can be 
connected only to letters on their own right side are called non-connectors. This name 
is conventionally used even though it’s a bit of a misnomer, since the so-called non-
connectors can indeed connect to letters that precede them in a word. But they can’t 
ever connect to letters that follow them. Other letters can connect to letters that both 
precede and follow them. These letters are called connectors.

When I present each of the letters to you, I give you the name of the letter in Arabic, 
which is a dummy word that starts with that letter (like how we, in English, pronounce 
the letter b as bee.) In this chapter, I use consistent names for the potential shapes of 
both the non-connectors and the connectors from the start. Here’s a description of 
the potential letters:
 
 Independent (I): The form of the letter that stands alone and not connected to 
any other letter.
 
 Initial Connected (In.C.): The form of the letter that’s not connected to any let-
ter on its own right side but is connected to a following letter on its left side.
 
 Medial (Med.): The form of the letter that’s connected to other letters on both 
its right and left sides.
 
 Final Connected (F.C.): The form of the letter that’s connected to another letter 
on its own right side but is also the final letter of a word.
 
One of the benefits of a For Dummies book is the modular organization. In other 
words, topics are self-contained in the book for you to explore however and when-
ever you see fit. Indeed, the rest of this book is organized that way. My advice to you, 
however, is that if you’re currently making your first foray into the alphabet, you 
should work through this particular chapter from start to finish. Because the Arabic 
letters connect with one another in a cursive script, they really need to be explored 
from start to finish so you can build on what you learn.
Exploring the Non-Connectors
 
Letters that can connect only on their own right side are called non-connectors. 
Because they can never connect to letters that follow them, they won’t have a form 
for the Initial Connected and Medial letters. They also, by definition, can never con-
nect to one another. I show you each of the non-connectors in the following sections.
’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif)
The ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) as a letter by itself represents the long a vowel (transliterated in this 
book as aa. You write the Independent ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) as a single line downward. The 
Final Connected ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) goes upward from the letter that it’s connected to. Table 3-1 
shows the two shapes of the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) as you will see them in the book and written 
by hand.

( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw)
The ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), which is transliterated as w in this book, can represent two sounds. 
It can be a consonant equal to the English w in wish. It also can stand for the long u 
vowel (transliterated in this book as uu) as in the English word food. There are two 
ways to know when the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) is being used as a consonant. If there’s a vowel 
symbol above or below the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), it represents the consonantal sound w. (You 
can explore vowels in the final section of this chapter.) Also, if the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) is fol-
lowed by a long vowel, written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), or ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), it’s being 
used as a consonant. If the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) doesn’t have a vowel, it’s being used to repre-
sent a long u vowel on whatever consonant it’s following.
You write the Independent ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) like a large comma with a space inside. The 
Final Connected ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) forms the same shape. Table 3-2 shows the two shapes of 
the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) as you will see them in the book and written by hand.

( ﺩﺍﻝdaal)
The ( ﺩﺍﻝdaal), which is transliterated in this book as d, represents the same sound

Taking a Look at Connectors
 
The majority of Arabic letters can connect on both their right and left sides. These 
are called connectors. They have four different shapes depending on their positions 
relative to other letters.
( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’), ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), ( ﺛﺎﺀthaa’), 
( ﻧﻮﻥnuun), and ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’)
The letters ( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’), ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), ( ﺛﺎﺀthaa’), ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun), and ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) are written with 
the same shapes. The only differences are that ( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’) is written with a single dot 
under the shape, ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’) is written with two dots above, ( ﺛﺎﺀthaa’) is written with 
three dots above, ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun) is written with a single dot above, and ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) rounds 
out the series with two dots below.
You write the Independent form like a bowl. The Initial Connected form is like a small 
comma that connects to the next letter. The Medial form is like a single wave between 
the letters on each side of the letter. The Final Connected form is like the Independent 
form, just connected with the letter preceding it.
( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’)
The ( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’), which is transliterated in this book as b, represents the b as in the 
English word bakery.
Table 3-9 shows the four shapes of the ( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’) as you will see them in the book and 
written by hand.

English word new. You write the Independent and Final Connected ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun) like a 
bowl — but a bit deeper in shape than the ( ﺑﺎﺀbaa’), ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), and ( ﺛﺎﺀthaa’). Refer 
to Table 3-12 for the four shapes of the ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun) as you will see them in the book

( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’)
The ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), which is transliterated in this book as y, can represent two sounds in 
Arabic. As a consonant, it’s the same as the y in the English word yes. However, it also 
can be used to signify the long i vowel (transliterated in this book as ii). There are 
two ways to know when the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is being used as a consonant. If you see a vowel 
symbol above or below the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), it represents the consonantal sound y. (You can 
explore vowels in the final section of this chapter.) If the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is followed by a 
long vowel — written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), or ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) — it’s also being 
used as a consonant. If the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) doesn’t have a vowel, it’s being used to repre-
sent a long i vowel on whatever consonant it’s following.
You write the Independent ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) like an s shape, which is identical in form to the 
’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura). The Initial Connected and Medial forms are identical 
in shape to the other letters in this section, except that the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) has two dots 
below the letter. The Final Connected form of the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is like the Independent 
form. Table 3-13 shows the four shapes of the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) as you will see them in the

( ﺟﻴﻢjiim), ( ﺣﺎﺀHaa), and ( ﺧﺎﺀkhaa’)
The ( ﺟﻴﻢjiim), ( ﺣﺎﺀHaa’), and ( ﺧﺎﺀkhaa’) are written with the same form. The only 
differences are that the ( ﺟﻴﻢjiim) has one dot below, the ( ﺣﺎﺀHaa’) has no dot at 
all, and the ( ﺧﺎﺀkhaa’) has one dot above.
You write the Independent form like a sharp angle with a hook below. The Initial Con-
nected and Medial forms have the same sharp angle, but no hook. The Final Connected 
form is like the Independent form, but it’s connected to the letter preceding it.
( ﺟﻴﻢjiim)
The ( ﺟﻴﻢjiim), transliterated in this book as j, represents the same sound as j in the 
English word jam. Check out Table 3-14 for the four shapes of the ( ﺟﻴﻢjiim) as you

that ( ﻏﹶﻴﹾﻦghayn) has one dot above it, and ( ﻋﹶﻴﹾﻦ3ayn) has none. The Independent form 
is written like the English letter c, with a hook. The Initial Connected form is the same as 
the Independent form except that it doesn’t have the hook, and it connects to the follow-
ing letter. The Medial form is like an inverted filled-in triangle, connected on both sides. 
The Final Connected form is written like the Medial form except that it has a final hook.
( ﻋﹶﻴﹾﻦ3ayn)
The ( ﻋﹶﻴﹾﻦ3ayn) has no correspondence in English. It’s produced by tightening the 
back of the throat and then speaking a vowel through it. This letter is transliterated in 
this book as 3. To see the four shapes of the ( ﻋﹶﻴﹾﻦ3ayn) as you will see them in the

( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’) and ( ﻗﺎﻑqaaf) are written with the same shape. The only difference is that ( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’) has one dot above it, and ( ﻗﺎﻑqaaf) has two. The Independent form is a 
small circle (written clockwise) with a hook. The Initial Connected form is the same 
as the Independent form except that it doesn’t have the hook, and it connects to the 
following letter. The Medial form is written as a clockwise circle, connected on both 
sides. The Final Connected form is a circle with a final hook. The hook of the ( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’) 
stays on the line of writing, but the hook of the ( ﻗﺎﻑqaaf) drops below.
( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’)
The ( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’), which is transliterated in this book as f, is the same sound as the f in

( ﻻﻡlaam)
The ( ﻻﻡlaam) is the same sound as the l in the English word loaf. The letter is trans-
literated as l.
 
Be careful not to mix the ( ﻻﻡlaam) up with the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif); both are written as a 
straight vertical line, so it’s easy to do. The way to distinguish the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) from the ( ﻻﻡlaam) is to remember that the ( ﻻﻡlaam) is a connector. So, if you see a straight 
line that connects with the next letter, it’s a ( ﻻﻡlaam). If it doesn’t connect with the 
next letter, you know it’s an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif). Additionally, the ( ﻻﻡlaam) has a 
hook on the Independent form and the Final Connected form.

Be careful not to mix the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) up with the ( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’) and ( ﻗﺎﻑqaaf), since 
they’re all essentially small circles. There are two ways to distinguish the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) 
from the ( ﻓﺎﺀfaa’) and the ( ﻗﺎﻑqaaf). Most importantly, the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) has no dots, 
and the others each have some. Also, the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) is written counterclockwise. 
The Independent and Final Connected forms of the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) have tails that drop 
below the line of writing.

The ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), ( ﻻﻡlaam), ( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’), ( ﺣﺎﺀHaa’), ( ﺧﺎﺀkhaa’), ( ﺟﻴﻢjiim), and  ﻣﻴﻢ
(miim) can join together in peculiar ways. When these letters connect to certain oth-
ers, they take on slightly different shapes than when they connect with any other let-
ter. The technical name for these atypically connected forms is ligature. For instance, 
you’ll notice that the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) leans more to the left than normal when following a ( ﻻﻡlaam). Here’s an example: ( ﻻlaa; no/not).
Similarly, when the preposition ( ﻝﹺli-) is followed by a noun with the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam), 
you don’t write the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif). This allows you to avoid writing three straight lines in 
a row. Here’s an example:
( ﻝﹺ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞli ar-rajul) becomes ( ﻟﹺﻠﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺli-r-rajuli; to the man)
In some Arabic fonts, when a ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) follows a ( ﻻﻡlaam), the ( ﻣﻴﻢmiim) may 
be written so that it’s sticking a bit to the right of the ( ﻻﻡlaam). 
Finally, in some Arabic fonts, when a ( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’), ( ﺣﺎﺀHaa’), ( ﺧﺎﺀkhaa’), or  ﺟﻴﻢ
(jiim) follows a ( ﻻﻡlaam), the ( ﻻﻡlaam) may be written sticking out of the middle of 
the following letter. 
( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’)
The ( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’), which is transliterated in this book as h, is the same sound as the h in 
the English word hot dog. The ( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’) has distinct shapes depending on its posi-
tion. For example, the Independent form is a small circle. The Initial Connected form 
is a larger circle with the smaller circle inside it, which is then connected to the fol-
lowing letter. The Medial form is written as a figure eight above and below the line of 
writing. The Final Connected form is like a raised oval connected to the preceding let-
ter. Refer to Table 3-30 for the four shapes of the ( ﻫﺎﺀhaa’) as you will see them in 
the book and written by hand.

( ﺀhamza)
The ( ﺀhamza), which is transliterated in this book as ’, represents the glottal stop. 
The glottal stop is that slight catch of air before actually releasing a vowel. For 
instance, think of how some people pronounce the word Latin (sort of like La’in). In 
Arabic, the ( ﺀhamza) is written as a tiny symbol like a backwards z.
The ( ﺀhamza) can be written above or below three letters: the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), the  ﻭﺍﻭ
(waaw), or the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’). These letters are called the seats of the ( ﺀhamza). It may 
also, in some cases, be written all on its own without one of the seats.
 
There’s a complicated set of rules governing where you place the ( ﺀhamza). Instead 
of memorizing the dozens of rules for it, you’ll instead intuitively pick up the rules by 
practicing your Arabic reading. The beauty of having full transliteration in this book 
is that you can always see how the Arabic is pronounced.
Here are several examples showing you the possible ways you may see the ( ﺀhamza):
’( ﺃﹶﻛﹾﻠﺔakla; food)
’( ﺃﹸﻡﹼumm; mother)
’( ﺇﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶﺓimra’a; woman)
’( ﺃﹶﺳﹾﺌﹺﻠﹶﺔas’ila; questions)
( ﺳﹸﺆﺍﻝsu’aal; question)
’( ﺃﹶﺻﹾﺪﹺﻗﺎﺀaSdiqaa’; friends)
Examining Vowels and Special Characters
Arabic was originally a purely consonantal alphabet. In other words, there were no 
vowels at all. As time went on, especially as people were learning Arabic as a second 
language, it was necessary to invent a system for telling readers what vowels a word 

 Chapter 3: The Write Stuff: How to Read and Write the Arabic Alphabet 69
had and when a consonant had no vowels or was doubled. Because this secondary 
system was invented later, it was tacked onto the alphabet as a system of symbols 
that you write above and below the existing letters. In this section, I introduce you to 
these important symbols.
(  ﹶfatHa)
The (  ﹶfatHa) represents a short a vowel. It’s written as a short dash above the letter. 
In other words, if you write a (  ﹶfatHa) above a ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), the combination is written 
( ﺕﹶta-). And if you write a (  ﹶfatHa) above a ( ﻛﺎﻑkaaf), you produce ( ﻙﹶka-).
Here are examples of words with only (  ﹶfatHa) to help you spot how they produce 
the short a vowel within the words. In each word, you see a (  ﹶfatHa) written above 
the first consonant:
( ﻛﹶﻠﹾﺐkalb; dog)
( ﺭﹶﺏﹼrabb; Lord)
( ﺩﹶﻡﹼdamm; blood)
(  ﹺkasra)
The (   ﹺkasra) represents a short i vowel. It’s usually written as a short dash below 
the letter. See the section on the (  ﹼshadda) for an exception to this rule. In other 
words, if you write a (   ﹺkasra) below a ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), the combination is written ( ﺕﹺti-). If 
you write a (   ﹺkasra) below a ( ﻛﺎﻑkaaf), you produce ( ﻙﹺki-).
Here are examples of words with only (   ﹺkasra) to help you spot how they produce 
the short i vowel within the words. In each word, you see a (   ﹺkasra) written below 
the first consonant:
( ﺣﹺﻠﹾﻢHilm; dream)
( ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮmiSr; Egypt)
( ﻃﹺﻔﹾﻞTifl; child)
(  ﹸDamma)
The (  ﹸDamma) represents a short u vowel. It’s a tiny ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) above the letter. If 
you write a (  ﹸDamma) above a ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), the combination is written ( ﺕﹸtu-). If you 
write a (  ﹸDamma) above a ( ﻛﺎﻑkaaf), you produce ( ﻙﹸku-).

Part I: Polishing Your Arabic Skills 
70
Here are examples of words with only (  ﹸDamma) to help you spot how they produce 
the short u vowel within the words. In each word, you see a (  ﹸDamma) written below 
the first consonant:
( ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺏqurb; near)
( ﻓﹸﺮﹾﻥfurn; oven)
’( ﺃﹸﻡﹼumm; mother)
(  ﹾsukuun)
The (  ﹾsukuun) represents the absence of a vowel. It’s a tiny circle written above the 
letter. Notice how in the following examples, the first consonant is followed by a vowel, 
but the second consonant isn’t. In each case, you spot a (  ﹾsukuun) written above the 
second consonant. This tells you that the second consonant isn’t followed by a vowel 
and closes the syllable with the first consonant and the vowel between them:
( ﺟﹸﻤﹾﻠﹶﺔjumla; sentence)
( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐmaktab; office)
( ﺩﹶﺭﹾﺱdars; lesson)
(  ﹼshadda)
The (  ﹼshadda) represents the doubling of a consonant. It’s a symbol similar to a tiny 
w written above the letter. You can then write a vowel over the (  ﹼshadda) to indicate 
that the doubled consonant has a vowel that follows it.
Notice how in the following examples, the first consonant has a vowel, but the second 
consonant has a (  ﹼshadda) and a vowel. In each case, you spot a (  ﹼshadda) and a 
vowel written above the second consonant:
( ﻣﹶﻜﱠﺔmakka; Mecca)
( ﺣﹶﺘﱠﻰHattaa; until)
( ﻗﹺﺼﱠﺔqiSSa; story)
 
When the (  ﹼshadda) is followed by the vowel (  ﹺkasra), people usually write the 
 (   ﹺkasra) below the (  ﹼshadda) but over the consonant itself (even though in every 
other situation, the (   ﹺkasra) is below the consonant). In other words, a short dash 
above a (  ﹼshadda) represents the vowel (   ﹶfatHa). A short dash below the (   ﹼshadda) 
but above the consonant represents the vowel (   ﹺkasra). The font in this book univer-
sally represents the (   ﹺkasra) between the (  ﹼshadda) and the consonant. Note how in 
these examples, the (   ﹺkasra) is above the consonant but below the (  ﹼshadda):
( ﻳﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱﹸyudarrisu; he teaches)
( ﺗﹸﻘﹶﺒﱢﻠﻴﻦﹶtuqabbiliina; you kiss)

 Chapter 3: The Write Stuff: How to Read and Write the Arabic Alphabet 71
( ﺁmadda)
Arabic doesn’t permit the writing of two ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalifs) side by side. Something about 
too many long lines in a row just wasn’t seen as attractive. Whenever circumstances 
of the language produce two ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalifs) at the beginning of a word, you instead write 
a single ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) with a ( ﺁmadda) over it. A ( ﺁmadda) is a wavy line you write over 
an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) to indicate the sound ’aa — that is, an initial glottal stop followed by a 
long a vowel.
Here are some examples of words with the ( ﺁmadda):
’( ﺁﻟﹶﺔaala; tool)
’( ﺁﺳﹺﻒaasif; sorry)
( ٱwaSla)
The ( ٱwaSla) is an elongated oval written over an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) to indicate that the  ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ
’(alif) has lost its vowel. The short a vowel over the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) in the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam) 
ordinarily disappears whenever there’s a preceding vowel. Because this vowel disap-
pearance is expected, people don’t bother writing the ( ٱwaSla) at all. I don’t use the  ٱ
(waSla) in this book. But just so you know what it is, here’s an example of a sentence 
with a ( ٱwaSla):
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺐﹶ ٱﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺩﹸﺑﹶﻲﱠ
(dhahaba-r-rajulu ’ilaa dubayya. The man went to Dubai.)

you also experience the adjectives necessary to liven 
things up a bit. Then I introduce you to the ways to com-
pare things — and label one as the best.
Finding out how to make one noun possess another puts 
you in the territory of the infamous ’iDaafa construction. 
In this part, the ’iDaafa becomes your best friend. Finally, 
in this part, I explain how to add relative clauses to your

I
f you’re like most people, you’ve never had to worry about case endings before — 
even in English. English nouns are the same whether they’re the subject, the object, 
or the word after a preposition. But English pronouns do preserve cases in some 
instances. “Him” can’t be a subject and “She” can’t be an object, after all. Unlike 
English, Arabic relies fairly heavily on cases.
The good news for you is that the situation isn’t nearly as bad as it could be. Latin 
has five cases, and depending on which of the five declensions of nouns they go on, 
there are dozens of different endings.
 
Arabic has only three cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive), and with very few 
exceptions, the ending is the same regardless of the gender and number of the noun. 
In this chapter, I show you the three case endings and how to produce them for the 
different nouns in an Arabic sentence.
Getting to the Point with 
the Nominative Case
The term nominative refers to nouns that are the subject of a sentence. In English 
grammar, there are several pronouns that have a separate nominative form. For 
example, in these sentences, “I” and “She” are nominative:
I study Arabic.
She is a fine doctor.

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
76
Any other form of the pronoun would create a grammatically incorrect sentence, 
such as this one (my apologies to Tarzan):
Me study Arabic.
 
Unlike English, Arabic has separate nominative forms of all nouns, not just pronouns.
The primary use of the nominative is as the subject of a sentence. Nominative is used 
in equational sentences, where the verb to be will be unstated. The nominative case is 
also used in verbal sentences. (See Chapter 2 for more on equational and verbal sen-
tences.) Here’s an example of an equational sentence and a verbal sentence with sub-
jects in the nominative case:
.ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺒﺎﺥﹸ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﹾﺒﹶﺦﹺ
(aT-Tabbaakhu fii-l-maTbakhi. The cook is in the kitchen.)
.ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱﹸ ﺍﻹﹺﻣﹾﺘﹺﺤﺎﻧﺎﺕﹺ
(qara’a al-mudarrisu al-’imtiHaanaati. The teacher read the tests.)
In the following sections, I show you the simple nominative and the indefinite nomina-
tive forms.
Keeping it simple: Simple nominative form
The simple nominative form is the form that’s used with definite nouns. To produce 
the simple nominative form, you simply place a (  ﹸDamma) on the last consonant of 
the noun. The (  ﹸDamma) is the tiny ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) shaped symbol that indicates a short 
u vowel. If you’re uncertain about the writing of a (  ﹸDamma), you may want to review 
Chapter 3, where I cover all the consonants and vowels in written Arabic. Here are 
examples of a few definite nouns with a (  ﹸDamma) added to the last consonant:
( ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸal-baytu; the house)
( ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺟﺎﻝﹸar-rijaalu; the men)
( ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﻭﹺﻻﺕﹸaT-Taawilaatu; the tables)
 
Ordinarily, the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) is pronounced as the vowel a at the end of a word. 
But when you put the simple nominative ending u on the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa), you pro-
nounce the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) like a taa’ (a t sound). Here’s an example of a noun with ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) without the simple nominative, followed by the same word with 
the additional (  ﹸDamma). Note how the t sound is inserted:
( ﺍﻷﹸﺳﹾﺘﺎﺫﺓal-’ustaadha; the professor)
( ﺍﻷﹸﺳﹾﺘﺎﺫﺓﹸal-’ustaadhatu; the professor)

 Chapter 4: Making Your Case with the Three Cases of the Arabic Noun 77
Adding an n for the indefinite nominative form
 
When a noun is indefinite, you still express the nominative case with a (  ﹸDamma), 
but you add a final n in the pronunciation. However, this particular sound isn’t repre-
sented with the letter ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun). Instead, it’s represented with a special form of the 
 
vowel. The Arabic name for such a final vowel closed with an n is ( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﻮﻳﻦtanwiin). 
Western grammarians have coined the term nunation to refer to this addition of a final 
n sound to the indefinite forms in Arabic. To write the indefinite nominative ending, 
 
you use a unique shape, which resembles a Damma with a hook on it:  . ﹲHere’s an 
 
example of that indefinite nominative ending in action: ( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏﹲkitaabun; a book).
In handwritten forms, sometimes you may see two Dammas simply drawn next to 
each other or inverted beside each other. No matter which form you see, these 
Dammas have the rather descriptive name Dammatayn (which literally means “two 
Dammas”). The Dammatayn looks like this: . ﹲ
When you write equational sentences with all the vowels expressed, you use the nom-
inative for both parts of the sentence. The subject can be definite, but the predicate is 
indefinite. Here are two equational sentences with indefinite predicates:
.ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹸ ﺟﹶﺪﻳﺪﺓﹲ
(as-sayyaaratu jadiidatun. The car is new.)
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲﹸ ﻣﹶﺴﹾﺮﻭﺭﹲ
(ar-ra’iisu masruurun. The president is happy.)
An indefinite noun also can be the subject in a verbal sentence. Here’s an example:
.ﺳﹶﻴﹸﺸﹾﺮﹺﻑﹸ ﻣﹸﺪﻳﺮﹲ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﻘﹺﺴﹾﻢﹺ
(sayushrifu mudiirun 3alaa-haadha-l-qismi. A director will oversee this 
department.)
 
In this practice set, I give you a number of Arabic sentences. Rewrite the sentence 
(for further writing practice) but add to the sentence the proper form of the nomina-
tive (Damma or the Dammatayn) wherever it should be found. Note that nominal sen-
tences require you to fill in two nominatives.

Making a Statement with 
the Accusative Case
The accusative case is the most poorly named of the cases because it sounds like it 
committed a crime or something. Actually, though, it’s not criminal at all. It’s mostly 
used to indicate the direct object in a sentence. Whoever said this case was difficult 
was falsely accusing it.
The English language preserves a few separate accusative forms for pronouns. 
Consider these examples:
I love her.
She hates him.
 
In Arabic, however, separate pronouns are all nominative. When you need to put a 
pronoun in a different case, it will always be a suffix on either a verb or a preposition.

 Chapter 4: Making Your Case with the Three Cases of the Arabic Noun 79
In this section, I show you the simple accusative, indefinite accusative, and accusa-
tive as predicate forms.
Forming the simple accusative form with fatHa
In Arabic, the simple accusative is used with definite nouns. This case is formed by 
adding a (  ﹶfatHa) to the final consonant of a word. Here are three definite nouns with 
the (  ﹶfatHa) indicating the simple accusative case:
( ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖﹶal-bayta; the house)
( ﺍﻷﹸﺳﹾﺘﺎﺫﹶﺓﹶal-’ustaadhata; the professor)
( ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺟﺎﻝﹶar-rijaala; the men)
Nouns with a feminine sound plural ending, however, form their accusative with a   ﹺ
(kasra). For example, consider this feminine plural noun: ( ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﻭﹺﻻﺕﹺaT-Taawilaati; the 
tables).
Using the indefinite accusative
The indefinite accusative ending is used to express the accusative case of an indefinite 
noun. Like the nominative, the indefinite accusative adds a final ( ﻧﻮﻥnuun) sound 
after the (  ﹶfatHa). This is indicated with a doubled fatHa, which is called fatHatayn. 
The fatHatayn looks like this: . ﹰ
 
When the fatHatayn is added to a singular feminine noun, there’s no other change in 
spelling. You can see in these examples that the fatHatayn symbol is placed directly 
above the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa):
( ﺣﹶﺪﻳﻘﺔﹰHadiiqatan; a park)
( ﺯﹺﻳﺎﺭﺓﹰziyaaratan; a visit)
Because masculine nouns don’t have distinct and recognizable endings like the femi-
nine nouns, Arabic uses the convention of putting the indefinite accusative ending on 
a masculine noun after first adding a dummy ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) to carry the symbol. Here are 
two masculine nouns in the indefinite accusative:
( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺑﺎﹰkitaaban; a book)
( ﻧﺎﺭﺍﹰnaaran; a fire)
Dealing with the accusative as predicate
As you probably know, an equational sentence in the present uses two nominatives. 
(See the earlier section “Getting to the Point with the Nominative Case” for more 
details.) But a special class of verbs that requires an accusative predicate exists in 
Arabic. Here’s an example of an equational sentence:

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
80
.ﺍﻟﺠﹶﻮﱡ ﻟﹶﻄﻴﻒﹲ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡﹶ
(al-jawwu laTiifun al-yawma. The weather is nice today.)
Remember that you don’t have to state the verb to be in Arabic. It’s just understood.
You can use the verb ( ﻛﺎﻥﹶkaana; was) to create a subject-predicate sentence refer-
ring to the past tense. But ( ﻛﺎﻥﹶkaana) requires a predicate in the accusative case. 
Notice in the following example how the subject of ( ﻛﺎﻥﹶkaana) is in the nominative, 
but the predicate is in accusative:
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﻮﱡ ﻟﹶﻄﻴﻔﺎﹰ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ ﺃﹶﻳﹾﻀﺎ ﹰ
(kaana-l-jawwu laTiifan ’amsi ’ayDan. Yesterday the weather was also nice.)
The predicate can also be another noun, as in this example:
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﻃﹶﺒﹼﺎﺧﺎﹰ ﺟﹶﻴﱢﺪﺍ ﹰ
(kaana ar-rajulu Tabbaakhan jayyidan. The man was a good cook.)
The class of verbs that takes the accusative predicate is known by the quaint name, 
( ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻭﹶﺃﹶﺧﹶﻮﺍﺗﹸﻬﺎkaana wa’akhawaatuhaa; kaana and her sisters). Some words in this 
group of verbs occur quite rarely. Here are examples of the most important ones that 
you (as an intermediate student) should know:
 
 ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa; [there is] not)
 
  ( ﺃﹶﺻﹾﺒﹶﺢaSbaHa; to become)
 
 ( ﻣﺎ ﻳﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸmaa yazaalu; yet, still)
 
 ( ﻻ ﻳﹶﻌﻮﺩﹸlaa ya3uudu; no longer, anymore)
 
Here are a few important points to remember about some of these verbs:
 
 ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) allows you to negate a nominal sentence in the present. (To see all 
the forms of laysa, check out Chapter 17 of this book.) Here are a few examples:
 
 .( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺖﹸ ﺟﺎﺋﹺﻌﺎﹰ ﺍﻵﻥﹶlastu jaa’i3an al-’aana. I’m not hungry now.)
 
 .( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻣﹸﺴﹾﺘﹶﻌﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ ﻟﹺﻺﻣﹾﺘﹺﺤﺎﻥﹺlaysa musta3iddan lil’imtiHaani. He isn’t ready 
 
 for the test.)
 
 You can use ( ﻣﺎ ﻳﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸmaa yazaalu) by itself to complement an equational sen-
tence. Check out this example:
 
 .( ﻣﺎ ﺗﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸ ﺣﹶﺰﻳﻨﺔﹰ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺸﹾﻜﹺﻠﺔmaa tazaalu Haziinatan 3alaa-l-mushkila. 
She’s still sad about the problem.)
 
 ( ﻣﺎ ﻳﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸmaa yazaalu) can also be used as an auxiliary to give the meaning still to 
a following verb. Consider this example:
 
 ( ﻣﺎ ﻳﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸ ﻳﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺐﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻔﹾﻠﺔﹺ؟maa yazaalu yadh-habu ’ilaa-l-Haflati? Is he 
 
 still going to the party?)

Writing All the Rest with the Genitive Case
The genitive case is generally used everywhere the nominative and accusative cases 
aren’t used. In this section, I show you the simple and indefinite forms of the genitive 
and offer several examples of how to use the genitive.
Working with simple genitive form
The simple genitive form is used whenever a definite noun follows a preposition or 
follows the first member of an ’iDaafa  (Refer to Chapter 7 for more on ’iDaafas.) You 
form this case in Arabic by adding a (   ﹺkasra) — the short i vowel — to the final con-
sonant of the noun. Like the nominative and accusative cases, you use the same end-
ing regardless of gender and number. The following are two definite nouns in the 
genitive:
( ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏﹺal-kitaabi; the book)
( ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺar-rajuli; the man)
Understanding indefinite genitive
The indefinite genitive ending is used to express the genitive case of an indefinite 
noun. Like the nominative and accusative, the indefinite genitive adds a final  ﻧﻮﻥ

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
82
(nuun) sound after the (  ﹺkasra). This is indicated with a doubled kasra (called kas-
ratayn). The kasratayn looks like this:  . ﹴTake a look at a few examples:
( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏﹴkitaabin; a book)
( ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞﹴrajulin; a man)
Discovering the uses of the genitive case
You use the genitive case in two important situations: following the head of an ’iDaafa 
and following a preposition. I explain each situation in the following sections.
Following the head of an ’iDaafa
You use the genitive case for all the words that follow the head of an ’iDaafa — no 
matter how many there are. In the following two examples, you see how the second 
and third words in an ’iDaafa are in the genitive case:
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹸ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺsayyaaratu ar-rajuli; the man’s car)
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹸ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻖﹺ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺsayyaaratu Sadiiqi-r-rajuli; the man’s friend’s car)
Following a preposition
You use the genitive whenever a noun directly follows a preposition. Here are exam-
ples with several different prepositions. Notice the use of the genitive after each one:
( ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺma3a-r-rajuli; with the man)
( ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﺪﻳﻘﺔﹺilaa-l-Hadiiqati; to the park)
( ﻣﹺﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖﹺmina-l-bayti; from the house)
( ﻟﹺﺼﹶﺪﻳﻖﹴliSadiiqin; for a friend)
A noun can follow a preposition but also can be the head of an ’iDaafa. In the follow-
ing example, I underline a word governed by a preposition and that starts out a long 
’iDaafa:
.ﻭﹶﺟﹶﺪﺕﱡ ﺁﻟﹶﺘﻲ ﺍﻟﺘﱠﺼﹾﻮﻳﺮﹺ ﺗﹶﺤﹾﺖﹶ ﻣﹶﻘﹾﻌﹶﺪﹺ ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹺ ﺑﹺﻨﹾﺖﹺ ﺧﺎﻟﹶﺘﻲ
(wajattu ’aalatii-t-taSwiiri tahta maq3adi sayyaarati binti khaalatii. I found my 
camera under the seat of my cousin’s car.)
 
When a noun in the genitive has possessive pronoun suffixes, the suffixes ( ﻩﹸhu) and 
 ( ﻫﹸﻢhum) change their vowels to i (written with a [  ﹺkasra]) to match the vowel of 
the genitive ending. Linguists call this a euphonic change (meaning it just sounds bet-
ter). Here are a few examples of nouns in the genitive with euphonically changed pos-
sessive pronoun suffixes:
( ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﺃﹸﻣﱢﻪﹺma3a ummihi; with this mother)
( ﻓﻲ ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺘﹺﻬﹺﻢfii baytihim; in their house)

Forming the Plural in Arabic
In This Chapter
 Forming the plural of regular feminine nouns
 Using broken plural patterns to form the masculine plural
 Recognizing and working with irregular plurals
 Putting nouns in the dual
M
ost languages have relatively simple ways of creating the plural. English, for 
instance, puts an s on the end of almost every noun. Sure, English has a hand-
ful of nouns like child/children and goose/geese that dance to their own tune. But 99 
percent of English nouns just add s to form the plural. In Arabic, however, well over 
half of the total nouns form their plural in a way that’s similar to the goose/geese situ-
ation in English.
Let’s face it: Among world languages, Arabic may have the most irregular and diffi-
cult-to-master system when it comes to talking about more than one thing. This sys-
tem is called the broken plural. At times over the years, the system has made me feel 
like a broken man! One grammarian lists 29 different patterns in use in Classical 
Arabic; and half of these patterns are still used in Modern Standard Arabic today. 
Don’t worry, though. In this chapter, I do everything I can to help you see how Arabic 
plurals work.
You have two options for grasping the forms of the plural in Arabic. I recommend that 
you pursue both of them at once. First, remember this one key bit of information: You 
just have to bite the bullet and memorize both the singular and plural of any new 
vocabulary item you want to acquire. If you make vocabulary cards, it’s a good idea 
to put both the singular and the plural on the cards. Any good dictionary will give you 
both forms.
Your second method of attack to grasp plurals in Arabic is what I cover in this chap-
ter. I show you that, in the end, Arabic does have some tendencies of regularity in 
this otherwise bewildering system. By the end of this chapter, you still won’t be able 
to take any new noun and infallibly produce the plural. But that’s not your fault. The 
language just isn’t fully regular. However, what you will be able to do is predict with a 
high degree of accuracy the plural of several common patterns of nouns. In addition, 
you’ll discover the more regular system of forming the dual.
 
English has a single plural ending for almost all nouns, regardless of gender. Arabic 
has different plural endings for the different genders. So in this chapter, I explain the 
ins and outs of making both feminine and masculine nouns plural. (If you need a 
refresher on masculine and feminine nouns, spend some time with Chapter 2.)

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
88
Working with Feminine Plural Nouns
The best way to discover the wonderful world of plurals is with the more or less regu-
lar class of nouns: feminine nouns. Feminine nouns frequently have the recognizable  ﺓ
(taa’ marbuuTa) endings. The masculine noun, by contrast, doesn’t have a recogniz-
able ending and will also not have a regular way to form the plural.
Many feminine nouns form the plural easily and regularly. All you have to do to form 
the regular feminine plural is to take off the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending and replace 
it with a different ending. But in other cases, unfortunately, the plural form will be 
unpredictable. So when it comes to making feminine nouns plural, you have two dif-
ferent situations: regular plurals and broken plurals. I explain what each of these two 
methods is and how to form both in the following sections.
Regular plural endings with ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa)
 
There are nouns that form their plural by just adding a regular plural ending to the 
noun or by replacing a singular ending with a plural ending. Arabic grammarians call 
this regular category the sound plurals. They’re called this because grammarians con-
sider them safe and sound. A more descriptive name for the sound plurals may be to 
call them suffixed plurals. In the case of feminine nouns, the sound plural is formed by 
removing the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) and replacing it with the following sound plural end-
ing: ( ﺍﺕaat).
Here are a few examples of how to form the plural of a regular feminine noun with the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending:
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓsayyaara; car) becomes ( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺍﺕsayyaraat; cars)
( ﻃﺎﻭﹺﻟﺔTaawila; table) becomes ( ﻃﺎﻭﹺﻻﺕTaawilaat; tables)
( ﺳﺎﻋﺔsaa3a; hour) becomes ( ﺳﺎﻋﺎﺕsaa3aat; hours)
Regular broken plurals with ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa)
I wish I could tell you that whenever you see the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending, you just 
replace it with ( ﺍﺕaat) to form the plural of a feminine noun. But, as you probably 
can guess, it’s a bit more complicated than that. For reasons that no one really 
knows, early Arabic speakers developed a system of forming plurals in which you 
don’t add an ending. Instead, you just change the vowels in the word.
Arab grammarians call this phenomenon the broken plural. It’s analogous to English 
plural formations such as mouse/mice and foot/feet. Languages closely related to 
Arabic, such as Hebrew and Aramaic, don’t have broken plurals, so it’s something 
early Arabic speakers developed all on their own. The term broken plural is just a 
translation of the term that’s used to describe them in Arabic: ( ﺟﹶﻤﹾﻊ ﺗﹶﻜﹾﺴﻴﺮjam3 
taksiir). Perhaps an Arab grammarian coined this term because they “broke” the 
regular pattern.

 Chapter 5: Forming the Plural in Arabic 89
Luckily, there’s a rule of sorts that you can use to predict the plural of certain femi-
nine nouns. When a feminine noun with the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending has a long i 
vowel — written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) — after the second letter of the root, it usually has a 
plural on a specific pattern.
 
However, before I show you that pattern, I need to explain what Arab grammarians 
mean when they use the term pattern. Because almost every Arabic word has three 
root consonants in it, grammarians long ago began using the Arabic root ( ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻞﹶfa3ala; 
to do) as a convenient model to describe any word pattern. Here’s an example: The 
noun ( ﻛﹶﻠﹺﻤﺔkalima) means word. But that noun also has a shape to it. It has the 
vowel a after the first consonant, the vowel i after the second, and the ( ﺓtaa’ mar-
buuTa) after the third. By inserting the shape of the word kalima into the root  ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻞﹶ
(fa3ala), you produce the nonexistent word ( ﻓﹶﻌﹺﻠﺔfa3ila). You can then say that 
 ( ﻛﹶﻠﹺﻤﺔkalima) is a noun on the pattern of ( ﻓﹶﻌﹺﻠﺔfa3ila).
This is a convenient way to reference the various plural forms you see in this book. 
When I say, for instance, that a certain noun forms its plural on a specific pattern, all 
you have to do is insert that noun’s three consonants into that pattern. For example, 
( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏkitaab; book) forms its plural on the pattern of ( ﻓﹸﻌﹸﻞfu3ul). So to produce 
the word books in Arabic, you replace the consonants in order to produce the word 
( ﻛﹸﺘﹸﺐkutub).
Getting back to feminine nouns with ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuta) and a long i vowel after the 
second consonant, they almost always form their plural on the pattern  ﻓﹶﻌﺎﺋﹺﻞ
(fa3aa’il). For example:
( ﺟﹶﺮﻳﺪﺓjariida; newspaper) becomes ( ﺟﹶﺮﺍﺋﹺﺪjaraa’id; newspapers)
( ﺣﹶﻘﻴﺒﺔHaqiiba; suitcase) becomes ( ﺣﹶﻘﺎﺋﹺﺐHaqaa’ib; suitcases)
 
The type of plural any given noun has isn’t a matter of choice or style. Each noun has 
a set plural you should learn at the same time that you learn the singular. You can 
discover the correct plural for a noun in the dictionary if you’re uncertain of it.
Some nouns that don’t have the ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa) ending also take the feminine 
sound plural ending. Check out the following examples:
( ﻃﹶﻠﹶﺐTalab; request) becomes ( ﻃﹶﻠﹶﺒﺎﺕTalabaat; requests)
( ﺧﹺﻄﺎﺏkhiTaab; speech) becomes ( ﺧﹺﻄﺎﺑﺎﺕkhiTaabaat; speeches)
 
In this exercise, I have listed the singular forms of some important feminine nouns. 
Put them in the correct plural form using the rules I explain in this section. In other 
words, if you see a long vowel in ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) after the second consonant of the root, 
 
you know you should form the plural using the same pattern as ( ﺟﹶﺮﻳﺪﺓjariida; news-
paper), which is shown earlier in the chapter. Otherwise, you can be sure that you 
just need to use the regular plural ending of ( ﺍﺕaat). Note: There are, of course, 
always exceptions in any language. But to help you build confidence, I include only 
nouns that aren’t exceptions to the rule.

Memorizing Masculine Plural Nouns
Here’s some potentially bad news: The more common and basic a masculine noun is, 
the more unpredictable its plural will be. There’s simply no way, based solely on the 
shape of the singular form, to predict that the plural of ( ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞrajul; man) would be ( ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝrijaal; men). Because of this irregularity, you just have to memorize the plural 
forms. A dictionary can help you determine the plural forms of the words you intend 
to put to memory.
 
The broken plural system in Arabic follows tendencies, but no rules work 100 percent 
of the time. When I tell you that a given word pattern frequently takes a certain plural 
pattern, there will always be exceptions. Also keep in mind that the particular plural 
pattern a noun uses is already determined. You can’t choose which of the patterns 
you want to use. Instead, your task is just to learn what pattern it does follow.
However, do note that a few patterns are somewhat predictable. So, in this section, 
I show you ten common plural patterns and give you examples of important and use-
ful words that follow each of them. In some cases, you can see that certain forms of 
singulars have a tendency to follow a given pattern. After you’ve seen the potential 
patterns of plurals, you’ll have a better chance of correctly guessing that something 
you run across in Arabic is a plural. And recognizing plurals allows you to succeed in 
finding the correct singular in a dictionary.
There are other plural patterns than the ten I focus on here. But they’re used for a 
smaller number of nouns. You quickly reach a point of diminishing returns when you 

 Chapter 5: Forming the Plural in Arabic 91
try to learn every possible plural pattern that Arabic uses. The ten you master in this 
chapter can equip you to recognize and produce the plurals of the vast majority of 
Arabic nouns.
 
To form the plural, you need to know two things. You need to know the three conso-
nants that make up the triliteral root for that word. You also need to know the word 
pattern that particular noun uses to form its plural. After you know those two things, 
all you have to do is substitute the consonants in the dummy root of the word pat-
tern (we use the root [ ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l; to make, do] traditionally) with the three consonants 
of the word you want to turn into the plural. If you’re unsure of how to do that, I dis-
cuss the triliteral root in depth and show you how to find the three consonants in 
Chapter 2. 
Plural Pattern 1: ( ﻓﹸﻌﹼﺎﻝfu33aal)
( ﻓﹸﻌﹼﺎﻝfu33aal) is a regular plural pattern for any noun derived from a Form I partici-
ple, which follows the word pattern ( ﻓﺎﻋﹺﻞfaa3il). An example of a noun that falls into 
this category is the word ( ﻛﺎﺗﹺﺐkaatib; writer). As a participle, this word means 
[someone] writing, and would take the sound plural endings. (A full discussion of the 
sound plural endings for participles is found in Chapter 18.) But the participle has 
also transitioned into a noun that means one who writes (that is, a writer). When this 
word is used as a noun, it doesn’t take the sound plural endings. Instead it forms its 
plural with Plural Pattern 1. The following are two common examples of plurals made 
with Pattern 1:
( ﻛﺎﺗﹺﺐkaatib; writer) becomes ( ﻛﹸﺘﹼﺎﺏkuttaab; writers)
( ﻋﺎﻣﹺﻞ3aamil; worker) becomes ( ﻋﹸﻤﹼﺎﻝ3 ummaal; workers)
Plural Pattern 2: ’( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﺎﻝaf3aal)
Nouns formed on the pattern ( ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻞfa3al) frequently follow Pattern 2, ’( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﺎﻝaf3aal). 
Here are a few common examples:
( ﻭﹶﻟﹶﺪwalad; child) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾﻻﺩawlaad; children)
( ﻣﹶﺜﹶﻞmathal; proverb) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺜﺎﻝamthaal; proverbs)
Plural Pattern 3: ( ﻓﹸﻌﻮﻝfu3uul)
Many nouns formed on the patterns ( ﻓﹺﻌﹾﻞfi3l), ( ﻓﹶﻌﹾﻞfa3l), and ( ﻓﹸﻌﹾﻞfu3l) form the 
plural with Pattern 3, ( ﻓﹸﻌﻮﻝfu3uul). Here are some common examples:
( ﺑﹶﻨﹾﻚbank; bank) becomes ( ﺑﹸﻨﻮﻙbunuuk; banks)
( ﻓﹶﺼﹾﻞfaSl; semester) becomes ( ﻓﹸﺼﻮﻝfuSuul; semesters)

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
92
Pattern 3 is also sometimes used for nouns with the patterns ( ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻞfa3al) and  ﻓﹶﻌﹺﻞ
(fa3il), such as ( ﻣﹶﻠﹺﻚmalik; king), which becomes ( ﻣﹸﻠﻮﻙmuluuk; kings).
 
Note that because this plural pattern separates the second and third consonants of 
the triliteral root, nouns with a doubled final consonant split them up if it takes the 
 
pattern that ( ﺻﹶﻒﹼSaff; class) takes. It becomes ( ﺻﹸﻔﻮﻑSufuuf; classes).
Plural Pattern 4: ( ﻓﹸﻌﹶﻞfu3al)
You’ll see Pattern 4 — ( ﻓﹸﻌﹶﻞfu3al) — mostly with nouns of the patterns ( ﻓﹸﻌﹾﻠﺔfu3la) 
and ( ﻓﹶﻌﹾﻠﺔfa3la). The following are some important nouns that use Pattern 4:
( ﻏﹸﺮﹾﻓﺔghurfa; room) becomes ( ﻏﹸﺮﹶﻑghuraf; rooms)
( ﺩﹶﻭﹾﻟﺔdawla; state) becomes ( ﺩﹸﻭﹶﻝduwal; states)
Plural Pattern 5: ( ﻓﹺﻌﺎﻝfi3aal)
Unfortunately, many different patterns of nouns use Pattern 5, ( ﻓﹺﻌﺎﻝfi3aal). But it’s a 
common enough plural pattern that you need to be ready for it. Some important 
nouns that use Pattern 5 include the following:
( ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞrajul; man) becomes ( ﺭﹺﺟﺎﻝrijaal; men)
( ﺑﹶﻠﹶﺪbalad; country) becomes ( ﺑﹺﻼﺩbilaad; countries)
 
To reinforce your mastery of the first five broken plural patterns, in this exercise I 
give you several singular nouns along with their plural pattern in brackets. Substitute 
the consonants of the singular into the pattern, and you’ll successfully convert the 
noun into the plural.

Plural Pattern 6: ( ﻓﹶﻮﺍﻋﹺﻞfawaa3il)
Nouns of the form ( ﻓﺎﻋﹺﻞfaa3il) that don’t refer to humans can take a plural accord-
ing to Pattern 6, ( ﻓﹶﻮﺍﻋﹺﻞfawaa3il). Here are a few common examples:
( ﻃﺎﺑﹺﻊTaabi3; printer) becomes ( ﻃﹶﻮﺍﺑﹺﻊTawaabi3; printers)
( ﺷﺎﺭﹺﻉshaari3; street) becomes ( ﺷﹶﻮﺍﺭﹺﻉshawaari3; streets)
( ﺧﺎﺗﹺﻢkhaatim; ring) becomes ( ﺧﹶﻮﺍﺗﹺﻢkhawaatim; rings)
Plural Pattern 7: ( ﻣﹶﻔﺎﻋﹺﻞmafaa3il)
Nouns referring to places, such as museums, schools, factories, and so on, that have 
the pattern of either ( ﻣﹶﻔﹾﻌﹶﻞmaf3al) or ( ﻣﹶﻔﹾﻌﹶﻠﺔmaf3ala) take Pattern 7 —  ﻣﹶﻔﺎﻋﹺﻞ
(mafaa3il) — almost exclusively. The following are some common examples:
( ﻣﹶﺼﹾﻨﹶﻊmaSna3; factory) becomes ( ﻣﹶﺼﺎﻧﹺﻊmaSaani3; factories)
( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐmaktab; office) becomes ( ﻣﹶﻜﺎﺗﹺﺐmakaatib; offices)
 
Note that the expected plural of the noun ( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺒﺔmaktaba; library) would be identi-
 
cal to the plural of ( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐmaktab; office). To avoid this potential problem, you’ll 
 
usually see a sound plural for this word instead: ( ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺒﺎﺕmaktabaat; libraries).
Plural Pattern 8: ( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﹺﻼﺀaf3ilaa’)
Nouns of the form ( ﻓﹶﻌﻴﻞfa3iil) usually use plural Pattern 8, ( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﹺﻼﺀaf3ilaa’). 
(Sometimes these nouns use Pattern 9, however. So refer to the next section for 
details on that pattern.) Here are some examples of nouns that use Pattern 8 to form 
the plural:
( ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻖSadiiq; friend) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺻﹾﺪﹺﻗﺎﺀaSdiqaa’; friends)
( ﻏﹶﻨﻲﹼghanii; rich person) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻨﹺﻴﺎﺀaghniyaa’; rich people)

94
Plural Pattern 9: ( ﻓﹸﻌﹶﻼﺀfu3alaa’)
Nouns of the form ( ﻓﹶﻌﻴﻞfa3iil) frequently use Pattern 9 — ( ﻓﹸﻌﹶﻼﺀfu3alaa’) — to 
form the plural. (Do note that nouns of this form may occasionally use Pattern 8, 
which is discussed in the previous section.) The following are common examples of 
nouns that use Pattern 9 to form the plural:
( ﺯﹶﻣﻴﻞzamiil; colleague) becomes ( ﺯﹸﻣﹶﻼﺀzumalaa’; colleagues)
( ﺭﹶﺋﻴﺲra’iis; president) becomes ( ﺭﹸﺅﹶﺳﺎﺀru’asaa’; presidents)
Plural Pattern 10: ( ﻓﹸﻌﹸﻞfu3ul)
Pattern 10 — ( ﻓﹸﻌﹸﻞfu3ul) — is another frustratingly random pattern that happens to 
be used with many words you need to know to be proficient in Arabic. The following 
are some examples of nouns that use Pattern 10 to form the plural:
( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏkitaab; book) becomes ( ﻛﹸﺘﹸﺐkutub; books)
( ﻣﹶﺪﻳﻨﺔmadiina; city) becomes ( ﻣﹸﺪﹸﻥmudun; cities)
 
To help you remember the way Patterns 6–10 work, in this exercise I give you several 
singular nouns along with their plural pattern in brackets. Substitute the consonants 
of the singular form into the pattern to convert the noun into the plural form.

 Chapter 5: Forming the Plural in Arabic 95
Discovering Nouns with Irregular Plurals
Several important nouns have irregular plurals, or they use patterns that aren’t com-
mon enough to treat separately. There’s no way to predict that any of these nouns 
should have the plural form that they have. And because these are some important and 
common nouns, you should just commit the singular and the plural forms to memory:
’( ﺃﹶﺏab; father) becomes ’( ﺁﺑﺎﺀaabaa’; fathers)
’( ﺃﹸﻡﹼumm; mother) becomes ’( ﺃﹸﻣﱠﻬﺎﺕummahaat; mothers)
’( ﺃﹶﺥakh; brother) becomes ’( ﺇﺧﹾﻮﺓikhwa; brothers)
’( ﺃﹸﺧﹾﺖukht; sister) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺧﹶﻮﺍﺕakhawaat; sisters)
’( ﺇﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﺓimra’a; woman) becomes ( ﻧﹺﺴﺎﺀnisaa’; women)
( ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡyawm; day) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻳﹼﺎﻡayyaam; days)
( ﺳﹶﻨﺔsana; year) becomes ( ﺳﹶﻨﹶﻮﺍﺕsanawaat; years)
’( ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺽarD; land) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺭﺍﺽﹴ / ﺍﻷﹶﺭﺍﺿﻲaraaDin/al-’araaDii; lands)
( ﻛﹸﺮﹾﺳﻲkursii; chair) becomes ( ﻛﹶﺮﺍﺱﹴ / ﺍﻟﻜﹶﺮﺍﺳﻲkaraasin/al-karaasii; chairs)
Seeing Double: Forming the Dual
You’ve heard that two’s company and three’s a crowd. Anytime you have exactly two 
of something, you can call it a pair, a couple, or, grammatically, a dual. (That’s why 
two people fighting is called a duel.) The broken plural patterns covered in preceding 
sections are challenging to learn. But the formation of dual nouns, covered in this sec-
tion, is a little easier to take. In Arabic you use a special ending, referred to as the dual 
ending, whenever you refer to only two of something (rather than three or more of 
something). Compared to the broken plural, mastering the dual will be a breeze.
 
To form the dual in Arabic, all you have to do is take the singular form and add the
 
ending ( ﺍﻥﹺaani) for the nominative and ( ﹶﻳﹾﻦﹺayni) for the accusative and genitive. 
(Check out Chapter 4 if you need a refresher on working with these cases.) Masculine 
and feminine nouns both take the same endings, but remember that the ( ﺓtaa’ mar-
buuTa) is secretly a taa’ and will turn back into a taa’ whenever you add an ending 
to it.
The dual of masculine nouns
In this section, I include some examples of how to form the dual when working with 
masculine nouns. Consider the following masculine singular noun: ( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏkitaab; 
book).

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
96
Here’s how to form the dual of two books in all three cases:
Nominative: ( ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺑﺎﻥﹺkitaabaani)
Accusative and genitive: (  ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺑﹶﻴﹾﻦﹺkitaabayni)
 
When a dual noun appears as the first word of an ’iDaafa, the final letter ( ﻥnuun) will 
disappear. (For more on the ’iDaafa construction, check out Chapter 7.) Here’s an 
example of what I mean:
.ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺘﺎ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺ ﺟﹶﺪﻳﺪﺍﻥﹺ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ
(baytaa-r-rajuli jadiidaani jiddan. The man’s two houses are very new.)
The dual of feminine nouns
As noted earlier, the dual of feminine nouns uses the same endings as the masculine 
nouns. Consider this singular feminine noun: ( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓsayyaara; car).
Here’s how to form the dual of two cars in each of the three cases:
Nominative: (  ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﹶﺗﺎﻥﹺsayyaarataani)
Accusative and genitive: ( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﹶﺗﹶﻴﹾﻦﹺsayyaaratayni)
 
Suppose you’re throwing a dinner party, and just as you’re about to go shopping, you 
find out that a few more good friends will be coming. That means you need to double 
your supplies. Examine your shopping list, and then convert every item into the dual 
form. You can just produce the dual of the Arabic word provided, but do produce 
 
both the nominative and accusative forms. ( ﻭﹶﺟﹾﺒﺔ ﻃﹶﻴﱢﺒﺔwajba Tayyiba). In other 
words, Bon Appetit!

 Chapter 5: Forming the Plural in Arabic 97
 Q. One item on your grocery list is a block of cheese ( ﺟﹸﺒﹾﻨﺔjubna). Convert this to 
the dual form, or two blocks of cheese.
 A. (  ﺟﹸﺒﹾﻨﹶﺘﺎﻥﹺ / ﺟﹸﺒﹾﻨﹶﺘﹶﻴﹾﻦﹺjubnataani/jubnatayni; two blocks of cheese)

f nouns and verbs are the meat and potatoes of language, adjectives and adverbs 
are certainly the spices that make the meal interesting. Being able to incorporate 
these important words expertly into your writing brings your prose to life — even if 
it’s just a simple business memo.
You may have noticed that an adjective or adverb has found its way into every sen-
tence of this chapter opening. So being hesitant with them can have a paralyzing 
effect on what you want to say. Mastering adjectives and adverbs is a win-win for you.
In this chapter, I show you the forms of the Arabic adjectives and the rules for how 
to use them within your sentences. This information will come in handy on a variety 
of occasions, such as when you want to compliment your boss about that nice tie. In 
this chapter, you also explore how to make a comparative adjective in Arabic. This 
information will equip you to tell your old friend that she looks younger than the last 
time you saw her. You also see how to jazz up your description of actions with Arabic 
adverbs. You’ll need them if you want to include on your resume how well you per-
form your duties. This chapter is a great way to make your Arabic writing even better!
Describing People and Things 
with Adjectives
To use adjectives in Arabic, you need to know how to properly form them and also 
how and where to add them to your sentence. The simple explanation is that an 
adjective must agree grammatically with the word it describes and come immediately 

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
100
after that word, as in the following example. I underline the adjective so you can 
spot it:
ﺗﹸﻌﹾﺠﹺﺒﹸﻚﹺ ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﹶﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺪﻳﺪﺓ؟
(tu3jibuki sayyaaratii al-jadiida? Do you like my new car?)
Recognizing adjective patterns
 
To recognize an adjective in Arabic, you must become familiar with the different word 
patterns that adjectives can follow. There are a handful of word patterns that are fre-
quently adjectives, but a strong majority of adjectives in Arabic use the word pattern ( ﻓﹶﻌﻴﻞfa3iil). To give you an idea of how two very different adjectives can each have 
the same word pattern, compare these antonyms:
( ﻛﹶﺒﻴﺮkabiir; big) 
( ﺻﹶﻐﻴﺮSaghiir; small)
These words mean the exact opposite, but what they do have in common is the exact 
same shape. They each have the vowel a after the first consonant and the long i after 
the second consonant.
Because the ( ﻓﹶﻌﻴﻞfa3iil) word pattern is so common, it’s the best adjective type to 
master first. Here are several common adjectives that follow this word pattern:
( ﺟﹶﺪﻳﺪjadiid; new)
( ﻗﹶﺪﻳﻢqadiim; old)
( ﺟﹶﻤﻴﻞjamiil; beautiful/handsome)
( ﻗﹶﺒﻴﺢqabiiH; ugly)
To read about some of the other adjective forms, check out the following section.
Wrestling with Arabic forms of the adjective
In your basic studies of Arabic nouns, you became acquainted with the masculine and 
feminine gender as well as the singular and plural. (To review these concepts, visit 
Chapters 2 and 5.) In the later section, “Keeping adjectives in agreement,” you dis-
cover that you have to use adjective forms that match your noun in gender and in 
number. The good news is that three of the four potential adjective endings are 
formed regularly.
 
The only tricky thing about adjectives in Arabic is that the masculine plural forms are 
unpredictably irregular. They’re irregular in the sense that their shapes can’t be pre-
dicted from the most basic form of the adjective — the masculine singular. As a 
result, you have to simply memorize the masculine plural (unless you want to reach 
for this book or your dictionary every time you want to write one).

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 101
The following sections introduce you to the shapes of the irregular masculine plurals 
as well as the (thankfully) fully regular masculine singular and feminine singular and 
plural forms.
Looking at irregular masculine plurals
In this section, I show you the forms of some common adjectives so you see the vari-
ous shapes that the masculine plural can take. Every adjective forms the feminine sin-
gular regularly by adding the suffix ( ﺓa) and the plural by adding the suffix ( ﺍﺕaat). 
But the pesky masculine plural turns out different in all three of the common adjec-
tives shown in Table 6-1. Because the masculine singular is the most basic form (it 
doesn’t have suffixes like the feminine forms), the masculine singular is the word that 
will double as the dictionary entry for every adjective.

A majority of adjectives form the masculine plural on the word pattern ( ﻓﹺﻌﺎﻝfi3aal), 
such as ( ﻛﹺﺒﺎﺭkibaar; big) in the previous table. So if you’re ever in a bind, don’t have 
access to a dictionary, and need to take a wild guess at forming a masculine plural 
adjective, go ahead and put it in the ( ﻓﹺﻌﺎﻝfi3aal) word pattern. Even if you’re wrong, 
people will understand what you mean to say. And most of the time you’ll be right 
anyway.
Adjectives can appear in several other word patterns as well. The word pattern  ﻓﹶﻌﻴﻞ
(fa3iil) (which you discover in the previous section) is so pervasive in the Arabic lan-
guage that it deserves to be learned as a type. The other potential word patterns an 
adjective can take, however, are numerous and not individually common. Table 6-2 
shows you four other word patterns for adjectives. The feminine will be regular, but 
be ready for the masculine plurals to be irregular.

Seeing patterns in feminine adjectives
Because feminine adjectives are always regular, the only thing worth mentioning that’s 
specific to feminine forms is a feature of adjectives on the word pattern ( ﻓﹶﻌﹾﻼﻥfa3lan). 
In Classical Arabic, these adjectives had a different feminine singular than what I show 
you in Table 6-3. That feminine singular was formed on the word pattern ( ﻓﹶﻌﹾﻠﻰfa3laa). 
You may see this obsolete feminine form in older books, but in Modern Standard Arabic 
it has been replaced by the more regular forms that I show you in Table 6-3.

angry
( ﻛﹶﺴﹾﻼﻥkaslaan)( ﻛﹶﺴﹾﻼﻧﺔkaslaana)
lazy
Adjectives like ( ﻋﹶﻄﹾﺸﺎﻥ3aTshaan; thirsty) are diptotes, meaning that they have only 
two case endings (the normal nominative u and the accusative a for both accusative 
and genitive). They also don’t take nunation (the additional n sound after the vowel to 
make it indefinite).
Using participles as adjectives
A number of adjectives in Arabic are actually participles. To understand what I mean, 
think about it from the standpoint of English: When you say something is exciting, 
you’re using the word as an adjective to describe that thing. But because of that -ing 
ending, exciting is a present participle. (A detailed description of participle formation 
is available to you in Chapter 18.)
 
The good news for you is that all the adjectives derived from participles take the reg-
ular masculine and feminine singular and plural sound endings. Table 6-4 shows three 
participles that have adjectival meanings.

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 103
Forming adjectives when naming places
I’m from Wisconsin originally. People there call themselves “Wisconsonites” (that is, 
they did until the label “Cheesehead” came along). Similarly, people from New York 
are called “New Yorkers.” And somebody from America is considered an “American.” 
In English, we have plenty of different endings to turn a place name into an adjective. 
It all depends on the ending of the word and, well, just what sounds the best. And 
then there’s Indiana with its Hoosiers — who knows what that’s all about!
 
Arabic, on the other hand, has a more regular way to form an adjective from a place 
 
name. You can add a doubled ( ﻱﹼyaa’) to almost every country (and even city) to cre-
 
ate an adjective that describes a person from that place. It’s known as the  ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔ
(nisba) ending because nisba in Arabic means relationship. With the place name  ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ
 
(miSr; Egypt), you just add the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending to the end to produce the fol-
 
lowing: ( ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮﻱﹼmiSrii; Egyptian).
 
To form the feminine and the plurals with ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba), keep in mind that the ending 
 
is actually a doubled ( ﻱﹼyaa’). Notice in the following examples the doubled ( ﻱﹼyaa’) 
 
in the feminine singular (FS) forms and the masculine and feminine plural forms (MP 
and FP):
( ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮﹺﻳﹼﺔmiSriyya; Egyptian; FS)
( ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮﹺﻳﹼﻮﻥﹶmiSriyyuuna; Egyptians; MP)
( ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮﹺﻳﹼﺎﺕmiSriyyaat; Egyptians; FP)
’( ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻥurdun; Jordan)
’( ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻧﻲﹼurdunii; Jordanians; MS)
’( ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻧﻴﹼﺔurduniyya; Jordanian; FS)
’( ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻧﹺﻴﹼﻮﻥﹶurduniyyuuna; Jordanians; MP)
’( ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻧﹺﻴﹼﺎﺕurduniyyaat; Jordanians; FP)
When you put the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending on a word with a final consonant, the word 
doesn’t undergo any further change. When you put the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) on a word with 
a final vowel or ( ﺓtaa’ marbuuTa), you drop the final syllable and add the  ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔ
(nisba) ending. (See Chapters 1 and 2 for more on the taa’ marbuuTa.) Here are a few 
examples:
’( ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺮﻳﻜﺎamriika; America) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺮﻳﻜﻲﹼamriikii; American)
( ﻟﻴﺒﹾﻴﺎliibyaa; Libya) becomes ( ﻟﻴﺒﻲﹼliibii; Libyan)
( ﻣﹶﻜﹼﺔmakka; Mecca) becomes ( ﻣﹶﻜﹼﻲﹼmakkii; Meccan)

Some country names have an ’( ﺍﻝalif laam), the Arabic definite article. The country 
 
we call Kuwait in English is literally called ( ﺍﻟﻜﹸﻮﹶﻳﹾﺖal-kuwayt; The Kuwait) in Arabic. 
For country names that have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam), you have to remove it and then add 
 
the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending. Take a look at two examples:
( ﺍﻟﻌﹺﺮﺍﻕal-3iraaq; Iraq) becomes ( ﻋﹺﺮﺍﻗﻲﹼ3iraqii; Iraqi)
( ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻫﹺﺮﺓal-qaahira; Cairo) becomes ( ﻗﺎﻫﹺﺮﻱﹼqaahirii; Cairene)
Labeling abstract concepts with adjectives
In English, we have adjectives that are formed from more abstract concepts than 
place names. Think, for instance, about how you can form the adjective melodic from 
the word melody and responsive from response.
In Arabic, you can create such abstract adjectives by putting the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) end-
ing on virtually any noun. Notice in the following examples how a noun generates a 
nisba adjective:
( ﻋﺎﺋﹺﻠﺔ3aa’ila; family) becomes ( ﻋﺎﺋﹺﻠﻲﹼ3aa’ilii; familial/domestic)
( ﻣﺎﻝmaal; money) becomes ( ﻣﺎﻟﻲﹼmaalii; monetary)
Some adjectives are formed by putting the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending on a historical root 
that you couldn’t have predicted. (A historical root is a root that was used thousands 
of years ago but changed over time.) Obsolete consonants from the historical root 
reappear when you put on the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending. Here are several examples of 
nisba adjectives formed on roots that are slightly different than the nouns they 
come from:
( ﻟﹸﻐﺔlugha; language) becomes ( ﻟﹸﻐﹶﻮﻱﹼlughawii; linguistic)
’( ﺃﹶﺏab; father) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺑﹶﻮﻱﹼabawii; paternal/fatherly)
’( ﺃﹶﺥakh; brother) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺧﹶﻮﻱﹼakhawii; fraternal/brotherly)
 
It’s time for you to take your ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) adjective formation quiz! For each of the 
following place names and nouns, create a nisba adjective. If you can also correctly 
write the English translation of your newly created adjective, you get extra credit. 
Two of the questions prompt you to produce feminine singular. All the rest should be 
masculine singular. Good luck!

Adding colors to your writing
 
Most of the adjectives describing color in Arabic are formed on the same word pat-
 
tern as the comparative form: ’( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﹶﻞaf3al). This pattern is discussed later in the 
chapter. You can see in Table 6-5 that the masculine forms are of the same pattern as 
the comparative adjective, but there are feminine singular forms as well (unlike the 
comparative adjective, which doesn’t have a feminine singular form).

When you get beyond the basic color wheel, however, you run into words formed 
 
with the ( ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔnisba) ending on nouns. Here are a few examples of how the  ﻧﹺﺴﹾﺒﺔ
(nisba) ending produces a color from a noun:
( ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺐdhahab; gold [the metal]) becomes ( ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﻲﹼdhahabii; golden [the color])
( ﺑﹸﺮﹾﺗﹸﻘﺎﻝburtuqaal; orange [the fruit] becomes ( ﺑﹸﺮﹾﺗﹸﻘﺎﻟﻲﹼburtuqaalii; orange 
[the color])
Keeping adjectives in agreement
In Arabic, when you’re using an adjective as a predicate, it must agree with the sub-
ject in gender and number. Here’s an assortment of examples using all the genders 
and numbers of Arabic:
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞ ﺗﹶﻌﺒﺎﻥ
(ar-rajul ta3baan. The man is tired.)
.ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﹾﺖ ﺫﹶﻛﹺﻴﹼﺔ
(al-bint dhakiyya. The girl is intelligent.)
.ﺍﻟﻨﱢﺴﺎﺀ ﻣﹶﺸﹾﻬﻮﺭﺍﺕ
(an-nisaa’ mashhuuraat. The women are famous.)
.ﺍﻟﻤﹺﺼﹾﺮﹺﻳﹼﻮﻥﹶ ﻟﹺﻄﺎﻑ
(al-maSriyyuuna liTaaf. The Egyptians are nice.)
 
Unlike English, adjectives in Arabic always follow the nouns they describe. For exam-
ple, in English you write the white house. In Arabic, this same phrase would literally 
be the house the white. Look at these two examples:
( ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﺍﻷﹶﺑﹾﻴﹶﺾal-bayt al-’abyaD; the white house)
( ﻣﹶﻮﹾﺿﻮﻉ ﻣﹸﻬﹺﻢﹼmawDu3 muhimm; an important issue)
In the previous two examples, I use what’s called the attributive adjective. An attribu-
tive adjective is so named because it attributes a description to the noun. In other 
words, it’s an attributive adjective when you describe a noun in your sentence with 
the adjective placed before it in English, such as blue cheese, sour cream, and the 
greasy spoon. When an adjective is attributive in Arabic, it always has to agree with the 
noun in gender (masculine or feminine), number (singular or plural), or state of defi-
niteness (whether it has the or a/an). (See Chapter 2 for more on the definite state.)
Notice how the adjectives in the following two sentences match their nouns’ definite 
or indefinite state:
.ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺖﹸ ﺷﹶﻴﺌﺎﹰ ﻏﹶﺮﻳﺒﺎﹰ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ
(ra’aytu shay’an ghariiban hunaaka. I saw  a strange thing there.)

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 107
.ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﺎﻳﺔ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻠﺔ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﺴﺎﺭ ﻫﹺﻲﹶ ﺍﻟﺴﱢﻔﺎﺭﺓ
(al-binaaya aT-Tawiila 3ala-l-yasaar hiya as-sifaara. The tall building on the left is 
the embassy.)
In other words, when you state an indefinite noun such as ( ﺷﹶﻴﺌﺎﹰshay’an; a thing), 
the adjective following the word will also be indefinite (as in the first example). But 
after a definite noun, such as the building (al-binaaya) in the second example, the 
adjective describing the noun also has to have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam).
 
The only exception to adjectives following nouns comes with the demonstrative adjec-
tives. These are the adjectives that demonstrate who or what you’re talking about, for 
example this car or that girl. The Arabic demonstrative adjectives come immediately 
before the nouns they go with, but they still agree in gender. As a rule, they only go 
before nouns with the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). Here are the masculine and feminine forms of 
this and that in Arabic with examples:
( ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖhaadha-l-bayt; this house) MS
( ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓhaadhihi-s-sayyaara; this car) FS
( ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞdhaalika-r-rajul; that man) MS
( ﺗﹺﻠﹾﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﻘﹼﺔtilka-sh-shaqqa; that apartment) FS
In addition to using adjectives to describe the nice girl, you can also use an adjective 
in a sentence such as The girl is nice. This is known as the predicate adjective. It’s sim-
ple to form in Arabic because you just put it after the noun and don’t add the ’( ﺍﻝalif 
laam) to the adjective. Here are two examples:
.( ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﹾﺖ ﻟﹶﻄﻴﻔﺔal-bint laTiifa. The girl is nice.)
.( ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﺎﻳﺔ ﺟﹶﻤﻴﻠﺔal-binaaya jamiila. The building is beautiful.)
 
A possessive pronoun suffix, such as my or her, also makes its noun definite. Because 
of that, if the noun in your sentence has one of the possessive pronoun suffixes, you 
have to make your adjective definite to match. (You can review possessive pronoun 
suffixes in Chapter 2.) You don’t put the same possessive pronoun suffix on the adjec-
tive. Instead, you just add the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam) to the adjective. This is the equivalent of 
saying, as in the following example, my idea the new. Take a look at how adjectives 
describing nouns with possessive pronoun suffixes have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam):
( ﻓﹺﻜﹾﺮﹶﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺪﻳﺪﺓfikratii al-jadiida; my new idea)
( ﻣﹺﻬﹾﻨﹶﺘﹸﻬﺎ ﺍﻟﺼﱠﻌﹾﺒﺔmihnatuhaa aS-Sa3ba; her difficult occupation)
Handling feminine singular 
for inanimate plurals
 
A curious grammatical rule in Arabic is that only humans are counted as plurals when 
it comes to adjective agreement. So the plural forms explored in the earlier section, 
“Wrestling with Arabic forms of the adjective,” are used to describe men, women, 
children, and even animals. 

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
108
But never will you see plural adjectives used for houses, cars, or balloons. Instead, 
whenever an inanimate object is plural, you use feminine singular adjectives. Here are 
some examples of inanimate plurals with their feminine singular adjectives:
.ﺍﻟﻘﹺﺼﹶﺺ ﻣﹸﻀﹾﺤﹺﻜﺔ
(al-qiSas muDHika. The stories are funny.)
.ﺍﻹﺟﺎﺑﺎﺕ ﺻﹶﺤﻴﺤﺔ
(al-’ijaabat SaHiiHa. The answers are correct.)
.ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺ ﺍﻷﹶﺣﹾﻼﻡ ﺣﹸﻠﹾﻮﹶﺓ
(haadhihi-l-’aHlaam Hulwa. These dreams are sweet.)
 
In this exercise, I list several phrases in English, each one containing a noun and an 
adjective. Using the dictionary in the back of this book, look up any words you don’t 
know, and then write the phrase in Arabic.

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 109
Describing Verbs with Adverbs
G.K. Chesterton said, “If a thing is worth doing, it’s worth doing badly.” An adverb 
describes the manner with which a verb is performed (badly or otherwise). Adverbs 
are easily formed in English. Most every adjective you know can get -ly tacked onto 
the end; at that point, you’ve made yourself an adverb. Perhaps someone can cook 
beautifully so their guests can eat greedily. And English has just one irregular adverb, 
“well” (which may explain why so many people don’t use it when they should!).
 
Arabic creates adverbs regularly as well. You can take any adjective, put it in the mas-
culine singular accusative indefinite form, and then use it as an adverb. (For a review 
of the accusative singular, see Chapter 4.) You put your adverb after the verb, as in 
English. Here are three adjectives turned into adverbs in the accusative indefinite:
( ﺟﹶﻤﻴﻞjamiil; beautiful)
.( ﻫﹺﻲﹶ ﺗﹸﻐﹶﻨﹼﻲ ﺟﹶﻤﻴﻼﹰhiya tughanni jamiilan. She sings beautifully.)
( ﺑﹶﻄﻲﺀbaTii’; slow)
.( ﺗﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹾ ﺑﹶﻄﻴﺌﺎﹰ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹶtakallam baTii’an, min faDlika. Please speak slowly.)
( ﺟﹶﻴﱢﺪjayyid; good)
.( ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺒﹶﺖﹾ ﺟﹶﻴﱢﺪﺍﹰkatabat jayyidan. She wrote well.)
In English, you can use a noun plus a preposition to create an adverbial phrase. For exam-
ple, in the sentence, Walk carefully on that ice, the adverb is carefully. Now consider the 
sentence, Handle this package with care. It showcases an adverbial phrase — with care.
Arabic also uses some prepositional phrases adverbially. You can add the prefixed 
preposition bi- to abstract nouns, and they take on an adverbial sense. Here are three 
common examples:
( ﺑﹺﻀﹶﺒﹾﻂbiDabT; with exactitude/exactly)
( ﺑﹺﺴﹶﻬﻮﻟﺔbisahuula; with ease/easily)
( ﺑﹶﺼﹶﻌﻮﺑﺔbiSa3uuba; with difficulty)
 
Each of the following sentences has a blank and an Arabic word in brackets. Your 
challenge is to put the bracketed word into the form of an adverb.

This Is Better than That: Making 
Comparisons
Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to use adjectives and adverbs, so now you 
can probably describe someone as beautiful or tell her that she sings beautifully. 
Another important skill is knowing how to tell someone that she’s more beautiful than 
another person. (Maybe I should caution you that whether you’re doing it in English 
or Arabic, you should be careful about the kinds of comparisons you make!).
To form the comparative in English, you can just add the suffix -er to most adjectives. 
For example:
big becomes bigger
small becomes smaller
As always, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, you wouldn’t say “beauti-
fuller.” If you did call someone “beautifuller,” she would understand that you intend a 
compliment, but she wouldn’t exactly be impressed with your language ability! 
Instead, you need to say someone is more beautiful, or you can switch to prettier.
Arabic, on the other hand, forms the comparative in several different ways depending 
on the words you’re using. I explain everything you need to know in the following 
sections.
Forming the comparative from the triliteral root
Like English, Arabic has a regular way to form the comparative. You take the three 
consonants of the adjective’s triliteral root (the three consonants any word contains), 
and you put them in the word pattern ’( ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻌﹶﻞaf3al).
In the following list, you see how several adjectives turn into the comparative form 
when you put their roots into the word pattern. To put the root into the comparative 
form, you add the prefix ’( ﺃﹶa-) and use the a vowel, which is written with the (  ﹶfatHa), 
over the second consonant of your root. Here are some examples:
( ﺻﹶﻐﻴﺮSaghiir; small) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺻﹾﻐﹶﺮaSghar; smaller)
( ﺣﹶﺴﹶﻦHasan; good) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺣﹾﺴﹶﻦaHsan; better)
( ﺻﹶﻌﹾﺐSa3b; difficult) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺻﹾﻌﹶﺐaS3ab; more difficult)

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 111
Dealing with geminate roots
If an adjective has geminate roots, meaning it has the same second and third conso-
nant, the two consonants are doubled in the comparative form, and you put the 
accent on the second syllable. Here are some examples of geminate roots becoming 
comparative adjectives:
( ﺣﺎﺭﹼHarr; warm) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺣﹶﺮﹼaHarr; warmer)
( ﻗﹶﻠﻴﻞqaliil; little/few) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻗﹶﻞﹼaqall; fewer)
( ﺧﹶﻔﻴﻒkhafiif; light) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺧﹶﻒﹼakhaff; lighter)
Encountering waaw or yaa’ 
as a third consonant
If an adjective has a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or a ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) as its third consonant, the comparative 
form is written with the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura) in place of the final consonant. 
(See Chapter 3 for information on the ’alif maksuura.) Take a look at a few examples:
( ﻏﹶﻨﻲghanii; rich) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻨﻰaghnaa; richer)
( ﻋﺎﻝﹴ3aalin; high) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﻋﹾﻠﻰa3laa; higher)
( ﺣﹸﻠﹾﻮHulw; sweet) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻠﻰaHlaa; sweeter)
( ﺫﹶﻛﻲdhakii; intelligent) becomes ’( ﺃﹶﺫﹾﻛﻰadhkaa; more intelligent)
 
When you use the comparative as a predicate, the preposition ( ﻣﹺﻦﹾmin) functions 
like English than. Just as you put the English word than directly in front of the word 
you want to compare, so also you put min directly in front of the noun you want to 
compare in Arabic. Min ordinarily means from. So in Arabic you’re saying something 
like, John is taller from Steve. But when you use min in a comparative sentence, 
always translate it as than. The following sentences show you some examples:
.ﻫﹸﻮﹶ ﺃﹶﻃﹾﻮﹶﻝ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺃﹶﺧﻲ
(huwa ’aTwal min ’akhii. He is taller than my brother.)
.ﻫﹺﻲﹶ ﺃﹶﺫﹾﻛﻰ ﻣﹺﻨﹼﻲ
(hiya ’adhkaa minnii. She is smarter than I.)
The comparative can function as an attributive adjective, as well. However, to do so 
correctly, the adjective must match its noun in definiteness, as in these examples:
.ﺑﹺﻌﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹶ ﺍﻷﹶﻏﹾﻠﻰ
(bi3tu as-sayyaarata al-’aghlaa. I sold the more expensive car.)
.ﻟﹶﺒﹺﺲﹶ ﺍﻟﻘﹶﻤﻴﺺ ﺍﻷﹶﺭﹾﺧﹶﺺ
(labisa al-qamiiS al-’arkhaS. He wore the cheaper shirt.)

For each of the following items, I give you a simple English sentence with something 
being compared to something else. Translate these into Arabic, observing the rules 
you have discovered in this section.
 Q. Ahmad is taller than Latiif.
 A. .’( ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪ ﺃﹶﻃﹾﻮﹶﻝ ﻣﹺﻦﹾ ﻟﹶﻄﻴﻒaHmad ’aTwal min laTiif.)
 27. My car is faster than your car. _______________________________________________
 28. This house is newer than that apartment. _____________________________________
 29. She is nicer than her sister. __________________________________________________
 30. The student is smarter than the teacher! ______________________________________
Being Super with the Superlative
The superlative takes your writing beyond saying something is merely good or even 
better. With the superlative, the object you’re talking about is really great. It may 
even be stupendous! It’s sort of like when two kids go back and forth saying, “My 
dad’s better than your dad!” Then a third kid walks up and ends the argument by stat-
ing in the superlative, “Well, my dad’s the best of all!”
 
To produce the superlative in English, you usually add -est to the regular adjective. 
Arabic doesn’t have a separate form for the superlative. Instead, you use the compar-
ative form in any of three constructions to produce a superlative idea. In the follow-
ing sections, I explain each of the constructions.
Comparative plus ’( ﺍﻝalif laam)
You can add the ’( ﺍﻝalif lam) to a comparative adjective used as a predicate, and it 
will pick up a superlative sense. If you’re rusty on adding the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam), see 
Chapter 2. Here are two examples:
.ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏ ﺍﻷﹶﻗﹾﺼﹶﺮ
(haadha-l-kitaab al-’aqSar. That book is shortest.)
.ﺃﹸﺳﹾﺘﺎﺫﻱ ﺍﻷﹶﺟﹶﺪﹼ ﻫﹸﻨﺎ
’(ustaadhii al-’ajadd hunaa. My professor is the newest one here.)
Comparative plus the indefinite singular
An indefinite noun following the comparative form can provide a superlative sense. (See 
Chapter 4 for more on creating indefinite nouns.) Take a look at two cases of this option:

 Chapter 6: Bringing Your Sentences to Life with Adjectives and Adverbs 113
.ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺ ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻀﹶﻞ ﻓﹺﻜﹾﺮﺓ ﺳﹶﻤﹺﻌﹾﺘﹸﻬﺎ
(haadhihi afDal fikra sami3tuha. That’s the best idea I’ve heard.)
.ﻫﹸﻮﹶ ﺃﹶﻓﹾﻘﹶﺮ ﺭﹶﺟﹸﻞ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻘﹶﺮﹾﻳﺔ
(huwa ’afqar rajul fii-l-qarya. He’s the poorest man in the town.)
Comparative plus an ’iDaafa
A comparative in an ’iDaafa construction with a definite plural noun produces a 
superlative in Arabic. (To discover more about the ’iDaafa, refer to Chapters 2 and 7.) 
Here are two examples of this superlative expression:
.ﻫﹸﻮﹶ ﺃﹶﺻﹾﻐﹶﺮ ﺍﻟﻄﱡﻼﹼﺏ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺼﱠﻒﹼ
(huwa ’aSghar aT-Tullab fii-S-Saff. He’s the youngest student in the class.)
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻋﻴﺪ ﻣﻴﻼﺩﻱ ﻓﻲ ﺃﹶﺣﹶﺮﹼ ﺍﻷﹶﻳﹼﺎﻡ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻨﺔ
(kaana 3iid miilaadii fii aHarr al-’ayyaam fii-s-sana. My birthday was on the 
warmest day of the year.)
 
In this exercise, I give you a few English sentences using superlatives. Each one is 
accompanied by three Arabic versions, only one of which expresses the English cor-
rectly. Remember that one of the Arabic sentences does match the English sentence 
provided, so dig in and find the one that follows the rules you discovered in this 
section.

Making Connections: Mastering 
the ’iDaafa Construction
In This Chapter
 Creating ’iDaafas in Arabic
 Using adjectives to modify words in a complex ’iDaafa
T
he goal of the lesson of this chapter is . . . Wait, let me try to write that more 
clearly: This chapter’s lesson’s goal . . . Huh, that still doesn’t sound quite right. 
How about, the goal of this chapter’s lesson? Oh bother! What I’m trying to write 
requires the ’iDaafa in Arabic. The ’iDaafa is the way that Arabic expresses posses-
sion of one noun over another. So you need it to state things like this lesson’s goal or 
the goal of this chapter.
You’ve seen simple two-word ’iDaafas in your beginning Arabic studies. (I provide 
you with a review of the ’iDaafa and practice with the two-word ’iDaafa in Chapter 2.) 
Intermediate level Arabic, however, permits ’iDaafas of several items. You can also 
describe one or more of the words in the ’iDaafa with adjectives. Keeping track of the 
genders and numbers through it all can be a real feat. But mastering the complex 
’iDaafa allows you to write much more concisely and correctly. This chapter familiar-
izes you with the rules of the ’iDaafa of the Arabic language. Oh, there it is! This chap-
ter’s goal is to present Arabic’s ’iDaafa rules!
Showing Possession and Relationship 
with ’iDaafas
In English, you describe possession or relationship using apostrophes; you use either 
’s or s’. Or you can use the preposition of. For example, the phrase the man’s office 
means the same thing as the office of the man.
 
In Arabic, however, possession is indicated a bit differently. You use the ’iDaafa con-
struction to express how one noun either possesses another or is in some kind of 
relationship with another. You describe possession or relationship by putting the two 
words next to each other with no words in between them. Here’s an example:  ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐ
 
( ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞmaktab ar-rajul), which means the man’s office (or literally, office the man).

118
Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
If you’re vowelling your text fully (meaning you add the formal final vowels that indi-
cate the noun’s case), the second member of the ’iDaafa chain will be in the genitive, 
like this: (  ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺐ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺmaktab ar-rajuli; the man’s office). Note: I’m not going to 
include all the formal final vowels in this chapter because the main lesson to take 
away here is the order of the words and agreement of the words in gender and state 
of definiteness. If you want to master the case endings, consult Chapter 4.
Tracking multiple words in an ’iDaafa
Adding multiple members to your ’iDaafa is just a matter of, well, piling them on. But 
keep in mind that every time you add a new word to the ’iDaafa, you’re indicating 
that the added word is somehow connected to the one before it. However, if there are 
three words in the ’iDaafa, you aren’t saying that all three are necessarily related to 
one another; you’re just saying that each is related to the word on either side of it.
 
Arabists sometimes call the first word in an ’iDaafa the head of the ’iDaafa. It’s really 
the topic being discussed in the sentence. One inviolable rule about the Arabic 
’iDaafa is that the first word can never take the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). If the second word is 
definite, either being a noun with the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam), a proper name, or a noun with a 
possessive pronoun suffix, the whole ’iDaafa is translated as if both members are 
definite.
To help you grasp the ’iDaafa concept, I start by showing you two-word ’iDaafas, and 
then I build from there. You’ll frequently need to create even longer ’iDaafas than 
those with two words, such as to render the phrase Arabic’s ’iDaafa rules. But you 
need to be comfortable with two-word ’iDaafas before moving on to three (or four or 
five).
Two-word ’iDaafas
A two-word ’iDaafa expresses possession of one noun over just one other noun. 
Here’s a two-word ’iDaafa that expresses actual ownership:
( ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺbayt ar-rajuli; the house of the man or the man’s house)
Even though the ’iDaafa expresses possession, you can also use it to describe rela-
tionships of one person with another. We do the same thing in English. Here are 
examples of two-word ’iDaafas describing relationships:
( ﺯﹶﻭﹾﺟﺔ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺzawjat ar-rajuli; the wife of the man or the man’s wife)
( ﻡﹸﺩﻳﺮﺓ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺmudiirat ar-rajuli; the boss of the man or the man’s boss)
Three-word ’iDaafas
Adding a third word to an ’iDaafa doesn’t imply that the first and third words have 
anything to do with each other (apart from the fact that each is somehow connected 
to the second word). Each item is only in charge, so to speak, of the item in front of it. 
Check out this three-word ’iDaafa as an example:
( ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓ ﻣﹸﺪﻳﺮﹺ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﻲsayyarat mudiir Sadiiqii; my friend’s boss’s car)

119
 Chapter 7: Making Connections: Mastering the ‘iDaafa Construction
You may go further to write, for instance, My friend’s boss’s car is red. In the course 
of the ’iDaafa, you discover who owns the car — namely, the boss. You also under-
stand something about the man who owns the car — that he’s my friend’s boss.
’iDaafas with more than three words
If you’re writing complex sentences in Arabic, you may need to write an ’iDaafa that 
has more than three words. Pushing the envelope just a bit further, here’s an example 
to show you how to make an ’iDaafa grow to impressive lengths:
ﻭﹶﺟﹶﺪﺕﱡ ﺁﻟﺔ ﺍﻟﺘﱠﺼﹾﻮﻳﺮ ﺗﹶﺤﹾﺖ ﻣﹶﻘﹾﻌﹶﺪﹺ ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹺ ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻦﹺ ﺧﺎﻟﻲ
(wajadtu ’aalat a-taSwiir taHt maq3adi sayyaarati ibni khaalii. I found the cam-
era under the seat of my cousin’s car.)
There’s no separate word in Arabic for the English cousin. Instead, you write son/
daughter of uncle/aunt. So the word cousin is already starting out as an ’iDaafa. When 
you put the possessive suffix on a word, that possessive suffix is in an ’iDaafa with 
the noun it owns. (If you’re rusty on the use of the possessive suffixes, you can find a 
review of them in Chapter 2.) Add all this together and the previous sentence con-
tains a whopping five-word ’iDaafa:
( ﻣﹶﻘﹾﻌﹶﺪﹺ ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓﹺ ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻦﹺ ﺧﺎﻟﻲmaq3adi sayyaarati ibni khaalii; seat – car – son – uncle 
– my)
Keeping these levels of ownership straight is difficult for English speakers. And 
because Arabic sentences frequently include ’iDaafas longer than three members, 
mastering what relationships an ’iDaafa does and doesn’t imply is crucial to effective 
reading and writing in Arabic.
 
Now it’s your turn to create some ’iDaafas. Each of the following English phrases 
requires an ’iDaafa to express it in Arabic. Put these ’iDaafas in the correct order (in 
Arabic). The sample practice question shows you a three-word ’iDaafa, but in the 
exercise I start you out slow with a few two-word ’iDaafas before moving on to the 
more difficult ones.

Crafting complex ’iDaafas using 
the different noun cases
’iDaafas aren’t just isolated phrases telling you how nouns possess each other. An 
’iDaafa can be the subject of a verb. It can be the direct object. An ’iDaafa can even 
follow a preposition. When an ’iDaafa appears in one of these grammatical positions, 
it will only be the head of the ’iDaafa that changes its grammatical case. (I discuss the 
grammatical cases of nouns in Chapter 4.) In this section, I show you some multiple 
member ’iDaafas in the nominative, accusative, and genitive cases.
No matter how long your ’iDaafa is, every word that follows the head of it will be in 
the genitive case. But if the head of the ’iDaafa is the subject of a verb or is the sub-
ject of an equational sentence, it should be in the nominative case. (See Chapter 2 for 
more on equational sentences.) To help you visualize how the case of the head of the 
’iDaafa changes, I underline the head of the ’iDaafa in all my examples.
Here are two ’iDaafas in nominative case. The first example is an equational sentence. 
The second is a verbal sentence:
.ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺏﹸ ﺃﹸﻣﹼﻲ ﻃﹶﻮﻳﻞﹲ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ
(kitaabu ’ummi Tawiilun jiddan. My mother’s book is too long.)
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹶﺖﹾ ﺑﹺﻨﹾﺖﹸ ﺧﺎﻟﺔﹺ ﺯﹶﻭﹾﺟﺘﹺﻚﹶ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺃﻭﺭﻭﺑﺎ
(dhahabat bintu khaalati zawjatika ’ilaa ’uuruubaa. Your wife’s cousin went to 
Europe.)
Similarly, when the head of an ’iDaafa is the object of a verb, it’s in the accusative 
case, and all the other members that follow it are in the genitive. Take a look at this 
example, which shows an accusative as the first word in an ’iDaafa:
.ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹾﺕﹸ ﻣﹶﺠﹾﻤﻮﻋﺔﹶ ﻣﹶﻘﺎﻻﺕﹺ ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺳﻲ
(qara’tu majmuu3ata maqaalaati mudarrisii. I read my teacher’s essay 
collection.)
 
The only way the head of an ’iDaafa can itself be genitive is when the ’iDaafa is gov-
erned by a preposition. Here’s an example with the ’iDaafa head underlined:
.ﺃﹶﺗﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺪﻳﺮﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺣﹶﻔﹾﻞﹺ ﺗﹶﻘﺎﻋﹸﺪﹺ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻮﹶﻇﱠﻒﹺ
’(ataa al-mudiiru ’ilaa Hafli taqaa3udi al-muwaDHDHafi. The director came to 
the employee’s retirement party.)

121
 Chapter 7: Making Connections: Mastering the ‘iDaafa Construction
There are just five nouns that have irregular forms for their three cases when they 
appear in an ’iDaafa. For your reference, Table 7-1 shows those five nouns and their 
forms.
Table 7-1 
Common Nouns Having Irregular Forms in an ‘iDaafa
Nominative
Accusative
Genitive
father’( ﺃﹶﺑﻮabuu)’( ﺃﹶﺑﺎabaa)’( ﺃﹶﺑﻲabii)
brother’( ﺃﹶﺧﻮakhuu)’( ﺃﹶﺧﺎakhaa)’( ﺃﹶﺧﻲakhii)
father-in-law( ﺣﹶﻤﻮHamuu)( ﺣﹶﻤﺎHamaa)( ﺣﹶﻤﻲHamii)
owner of( ﺫﻭdhuu)( ﺫﺍdhaa)( ﺫﻱdhii)
mouth( ﻓﻮfuu)( ﻓﺎfaa)( ﻓﻲfii)
 
When a noun with a masculine sound plural ending is at the head of an ’iDaafa, you 
drop off the final ( ﻥnuun) of the suffix. (To study all the sound plural endings, see 
Chapter 18.) Here are two examples:
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻣﹸﺮﺍﺳﹺﻠﻮ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺮﻳﺪﺓ ﻣﹶﺸﹾﻐﻮﻟﻴﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡ
(kaana muraasiluu al-jariida mashghuuliina al-yawm. The newspaper correspon-
dents were busy today.)
.ﺃﹶﻋﹾﺘﹶﻘﹺﺪﹸ ﺇﻥﱠ ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺳﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺪﹾﺭﹶﺳﺔ ﻣﹸﻤﹾﺘﺎﺯﻭﻥﹶ
’(a3taqidu ’inna mudarrisii al-madrasa mumtaazuuna. I think that the school’s 
teachers are excellent.)
Including Adjectives in 
Your Complex ’iDaafas
Knowing how to put many words together in lengthy ’iDaafas is a good starting point, 
but wouldn’t it be nice to be able to describe the words in your ’iDaafa with adjec-
tives as well? If you answered with a resounding “yes!” you’ve come to the right place. 
In this section, I show you the rules for adding adjectives to your ’iDaafas.
Looking at ’iDaafas with single adjectives
Adjectives in Arabic ordinarily follow the words they describe. (Chapter 6 covers 
adjectives in detail.) Here’s an example showing how the two words usually appear 
together:
( ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﺮﻳﻌﺔas-sayyaara as-sarii3a; the fast car)

122
Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
 
However, an adjective isn’t allowed to interrupt the flow of the ’iDaafa. For this rea-
son, if you want to describe a word in an ’iDaafa, you must put the adjective after the 
’iDaafa itself. The adjective still needs to agree with its noun in gender, number, and 
definiteness. Here’s a simple ’iDaafa with a single adjective describing the first word 
in the ’iDaafa:
( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻔﻴﺪnuSH jaddatii al-mufiid; my grandmother’s useful advice)
In this example, ( ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻔﻴﺪal-mufiid; useful) is an adjective that’s further describing the 
advice, not the grandmother. Notice that the word ( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢnuSH; advice) itself doesn’t 
have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). It can’t have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam) because it’s the head of an 
’iDaafa. The next word in the ’iDaafa, however, ( ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﻲjaddatii; my grandmother), is 
definite because it has the possessive pronoun suffix. If the final word in an ’iDaafa is 
definite, the whole ’iDaafa is definite. For that reason, the adjective describing the 
word ( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢnuSH) has to have the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam).
 
The only partial exception to the rule that nothing can interrupt the flow of the 
’iDaafa is when you use demonstrative adjectives, such as this or that. Because 
demonstrative adjectives usually come before the noun in Arabic, they can come 
between two words in an ’iDaafa. Here’s an example:
( ﺣﹶﻞﹼ ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺸﹾﻜﹺﻠﺔHall haadhihi-l-mushkila; the solution of this problem)
However, if the demonstrative adjective describes the head of the ’iDaafa, it follows 
the ’iDaafa, as you see here:
( ﻣﹺﻦ ﻭﹸﺟﹾﻬﹶﺔﹺ ﺍﻟﻨﱠﻈﹶﺮﹺ ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺmin wujhati-n-naDHari haadhihi; from this point of view)

 Chapter 7: Making Connections: Mastering the ‘iDaafa Construction
Handling ’iDaafas with multiple adjectives
After reading the heading for this section, you’re probably thinking: “How can I possi-
bly use an adjective to describe both nouns in an ’iDaafa?” I’m glad you asked! In this 
section, I demonstrate how you can add multiple adjectives to complex ’iDaafas by 
expanding on a previous example about my grandmother. In this example, the adjec-
tive describing her advice comes after the ’iDaafa itself:
( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻔﻴﺪnuSH jaddatii al-mufiid; my grandmother’s useful advice)
However, I can use an adjective to describe my grandmother instead of an adjective 
describing her advice. In this case, the adjective still follows the whole ’iDaafa, as in 
this example:
( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻄﻴﻔﺔnuSH jaddatii al-laTiifa; my kindly grandmother’s advice)
 
If I want to add one adjective describing the advice and another adjective describing 
my grandmother, the rule is to add the adjectives — in reverse order — after the 
’iDaafa. In other words, the adjective describing my grandmother comes first, 
because grandmother is the final word in the ’iDaafa. Then I add the adjective describ-
ing her advice. Look at how the adjective for the last word in the ’iDaafa comes 
before the adjective for the first word:
( ﻧﹸﺼﹾﺢ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﻲ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻄﻴﻔﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻔﻴﺪnuSH jaddatii al-laTiifa al-mufiid; my kindly grand-
mother’s useful advice)
If your ’iDaafa has three or more words in it, you continue to add the adjectives — in 
reverse order — after the ’iDaafa, as in this ridiculously complicated example:
ﻣﹸﺪﻳﺮ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺒﺔ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﻣﹺﻌﺔ ﺍﻷﹶﻣﹾﺮﻳﻜﹺﻴﹼﺔ ﺍﻟﻠﱡﻐﹶﻮﹺﻳﹼﺔ ﺍﻷﹶﻭﱠﻝ
(mudiir maktabat al-jaami3a al-amriikiyya al-lughawiyya al-’awwal; the 
American university’s linguistic library’s first director or the first director of the 
American university’s linguistic library)
 
Constructing an ’iDaafa as long and complicated as the preceding example isn’t fun 
for anyone, even native writers. To avoid making an ’iDaafa this long in the first 
place, you have the option of breaking up the ’iDaafa with a preposition. Here’s the 
same long example, but this time it’s made a bit more manageable by splitting the 
subject off the ’iDaafa with a preposition:
ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺪﻳﺮ ﺍﻷﹶﻭﱠﻝ ﻟﹺﻤﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺒﺔ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﻣﹺﻌﺔ ﺍﻷﹶﻣﹾﺮﻳﻜﹺﻴﹼﺔ ﺍﻟﻠﱡﻐﹶﻮﹺﻳﹼﺔ

You’re hosting a working luncheon with representatives from several companies and 
government entities. The place settings contain placards with the titles of several 
important guests. The placards were translated from English into Arabic by a co-

A
 good writer goes beyond just writing a subject, verb, and object. The world of 
subordinate clauses allows you to give important background on a topic, all 
within a single sentence. The relative clause lets you add levels of detail in your back-
ground explanation that go way beyond what adjectives alone can achieve.
Like other skills you acquire by working through this book, the use of the relative 
clause in Arabic distinguishes you as an accomplished writer. In this chapter, you 
discover the essential tricks for forming relative clauses correctly and precisely in 
Arabic.
Getting to Know the Singular 
Relative Pronoun
A relative clause is a secondary clause that tells you information about a word in the 
main sentence. Here’s an example of a sentence with a relative clause in English: The 
man, who just called me, is my brother. The main sentence informs the reader that The 
man is my brother. The relative clause gives information about the man in the form of 
sub-clause.
Before you can compose a relative clause, you need to understand the components 
that make them up and the situations in which to include them. So in this section, I 
cover the elements of a relative clause and then discuss the masculine and feminine 
singular relative pronouns. At the end of the section, I discuss relative pronouns and 
the parts of speech. And, as usual, I include practice questions to help you sharpen 
your skills.

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
128
Dissecting relative clauses
 
The relative clause is always about someone or something in the sentence. The word 
being described further in this way is called the antecedent. As a rule, the antecedent 
comes before the relative clause and ordinarily is the word that immediately pre-
cedes the relative clause.
When you describe someone or something, you frequently use an adjective. You may, 
for instance, say that a man you met is “tall.” Perhaps you want to describe the man 
even further and add that he’s “tall and angry.” Adjectives can take you a long way 
toward describing physical and other attributes.
Sometimes, however, what you want to describe to your reader isn’t a visible attri-
bute, but a fact concerning your topic. You may want to describe important back-
ground information to help your reader or listener understand the topic better. For 
instance, you may write that you met “the tall and angry man who came to the party 
with Fatima.” This information may be significant if a second tall and angry man came 
to the party with Dalia!
The way you convey background information in this way is through a relative clause. 
If you remove the whole relative clause, what’s left over is a separate and grammati-
cal sentence. Here’s an example in Arabic where the relative clause comes at the end 
of the sentence:
. ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻴﹾﻠﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺎﺿﹺﻴﺔ ﺍﻟﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺑﹺﺎﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻞﹺ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻐﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻥ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺃﹶﺗﻰ ﺇﹺﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻔﹾﻠﺔﹺ ﻣﹶﻊﹶ
ﻓﺎﻃﹺﻤﺔ
(al-layla al-maaDiya iltaqaytu bir-rajuli aT-Tawiili wa-l-ghaDbaan alladhii ’ataa 
’ilaa-l-Haflati ma3a faaTima. Last night I met the tall and angry man who came to 
the party with Fatima.)
Here’s the same sentence without the relative clause. As you can see, it’s still a com-
plete thought:
.ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻴﹾﻠﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺎﺿﹺﻴﺔ ﺍﻟﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺑﹺﺎﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹺ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻞﹺ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻐﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻥ
(al-layla al-maaDiya iltaqaytu bir-rajuli aT-Tawiili wa-l-ghaDbaan. Last night I 
met the tall and angry man.)
A relative clause can come in the middle of the sentence as well. Here’s a sentence 
with the relative clause imbedded inside:
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻞﹸ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻐﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻥ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺃﹶﺗﻰ ﺇﹺﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻔﹾﻠﺔﹺ ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﻓﺎﻃﹺﻤﺔ ﺃﹶﺧﹾﺒﹶﺮﹶﻧﻲ ﻧﹸﻜﹾﺘﹶﺔﹰ
(a-rajul aT-Tawiil wa-l-ghaDbaan alladhii ’ata ’ila-l-Hafla ma3a faaTima ’akhba-
rani nuktatan. The tall and angry man who came to the party with Fatima told me 
a joke.)
You can remove the relative clause from the middle and still have a full sentence:
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻞﹸ ﻭﹶﺍﻟﻐﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻥ ﺃﹶﺧﹾﺒﹶﺮﹶﻧﻲ ﻧﹸﻜﹾﺘﹶﺔﹰ
(a-rajul aT-Tawiil wa-l-ghaDbaan ’akhbarani nuktatan. The tall and angry man 
told me a joke.)

 Chapter 8: Pronouns: Relatively Speaking 129
 
Use ( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱalladhii; who/that) or ( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii; who/that) only when the antecedent is a 
 
definite noun — that is, it has the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam; the), a possessive suffix, or it’s the 
 
head of an ’iDaafa that’s definite. Arabic has a slightly different way of forming rela-
tive clauses for indefinite antecedents (see the later section “Looking at Other 
Relative Clauses” for details).
Masculine singular relative ( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱalladhi)
Arabic has separate relative pronouns for the different genders and numbers of 
potential antecedents. When the antecedent is a masculine singular noun in the 
definite state, whether it’s a person or an object, use the pronoun ( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱalladhii; 
who/that). Check out the following examples:
.ﺍﻟﻔﹺﻠﹾﻢ ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺷﺎﻫﹶﺪﹾﻧﺎﻩﹸ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺭﺍﺋﹺﻌﺎﹰ
(al-film alladhii shaahadnaahu ’amsi kaana raa’i3an. The film that we saw yes-
terday was tremendous.)
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞ ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺍﹺﺗﱠﺼﹶﻞﹶ ﺑﻲ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ ﻗﺎﻝﹶ ﻟﻲ ﻧﹶﻔﹾﺲﹶ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﻲﹾﺀ
(ar-rajul alladhii ittaSala bii ‘amsi qaala lii nafsa-sh-shay’. The man who called 
me yesterday told me the same thing.)
Feminine singular relative ( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii)
When the antecedent in a relative clause is a feminine singular definite noun, use the 
relative pronoun ( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii; who/that). Here are three examples of sentences with 
feminine singular definite antecedents:
.ﺃﹸﻣﹼﻲ ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲ ﺃﹶﺗﱠﺼﹺﻞﹸ ﺑﹺﻬﺎ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻣﹺﻴﹼﺎﹰ ﻣﺎ ﺗﹶﺰﺍﻝﹸ ﺗﹶﻘﹾﻠﹶﻖﹸ ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻲﱠ
’(ummii allatii ’attaSilu bihaa yawmiyyan maa tazaalu taqlaqu 3alayya. My 
mother, whom I call daily, still worries about me.)
.ﺍﹶﻟﻠﱡﻐﺔﹸ ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲ ﺗﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺳﹸﻬﺎ ﻫﹺﻲﹶ ﻣﹸﻔﻴﺪﺓﹲ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﺮﹾﻕﹺ ﺍﻷﹶﻭﹾﺳﹶﻂﹺ
(al-lughatu allatii tadrusuhaa hiya mufiidatun jiddan fii-sh-sharqi -l’awsaTi. 
The language that you are studying is very useful in the Middle East.)
 
Suppose you’re writing an e-mail describing your vacation to a friend. Depending on 
the gender of the antecedent, write the correct form of the relative pronoun on the 
lines that are provided to you.
 Q. .( ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺳﺎﻟﺔ _____ ﺃﹶﻛﹾﺘﹸﺒﹸﻬﺎ ﻟﹶﻚﹶ ﻓﹶﻬﹺﻲﹶ ﻋﹶﻦ ﻋﹸﻄﹾﻠﹶﺘﹺﻨﺎar-risaalatu _____ ’aktubuhaa lakaa

 Chapter 8: Pronouns: Relatively Speaking 131
Singular relative pronouns and parts of speech
A relative pronoun in Arabic can appear anywhere a noun might. It could be the sub-
ject of its own verb. You could have a relative pronoun as the object of a verb within 
a relative clause. It also could be governed by a preposition.
 
The relative pronoun presents a situation in which the normally complicated Arabic 
language is considerably easier than English. Arabic has preserved case endings for 
almost all nouns, while English nouns are invariable. Arabic relative pronouns, how-
ever, are nondeclinable (meaning, they have a single form that can stand for the sub-
 
ject or object within a relative clause). You use the forms ( ﺍﻟﱠﺪﻱalladhii; who/that) or 
 ( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii; who/that) regardless of whether the relative pronoun is the subject or 
 
object in the relative clause. English, by contrast, has one form for the nominative, 
who, another for accusative or after prepositions, whom, and even a genitive relative 
pronoun, whose.
Relative pronoun as a subject
No matter what role the antecedent plays in the sentence, the relative pronoun 
describing it can be the subject of the relative clause. Here’s a relative clause with the 
relative pronoun as a subject:
.ﺃﹸﺣﹺﺐﱡ ﺍﻟﻜﺎﺗﹺﺐﹶ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺐﹶ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏﹶ
’(uHibbu al-kaatiba alladhii kataba dhaalika-l-kitaaba. I love the author who 
wrote that book.)
Relative pronoun as a direct object
 
An antecedent can be the object within a relative clause. Whenever a relative pro-
noun is the object, you then have to add an object pronoun either directly to the verb 
or to a preposition required by the verb. This produces the Arabic equivalent of say-
ing “The man whom I met him” or “His book that he wrote it.” This certainly does 
sound odd to an English-speaking person. But if you form a relative clause and forget 
to use these object pronouns, a more advanced reader of Arabic will certainly notice 
their absence.
The extra pronoun you add when the relative pronoun is an object or is governed by 
a preposition is an essential part of a fully grammatical relative clause in Arabic. 
Grammarians call the object pronoun used in this way a resumptive pronoun, meaning 
it resumes speaking about the antecedent.
The following are two examples of relative pronouns that are direct objects. I under-
line the resumptive pronoun in the Arabic so you can become accustomed to its use:
.ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺍﹺﻟﺘﹶﻘﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺑﹺﻪﹺ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻔﹾﻠﺔﹺ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻃﹶﻮﻳﻼﹰ ﻭﹶﻏﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻥﹶ
(ar-rajulu alladhii iltaqaytu bihi fi-l-Haflati kaana Tawiilan wa-ghaDbaana. The 
man whom I met at the party was tall and angry.)
.ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹾﺕﹸ ﻛﹺﺘﺎﺑﹶﻪﹸ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺒﹶﻪﹸ ﻋﹶﻦ ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻮﹾﺿﻮﻉﹺ
(qara’tu kitaabahu alladhii katabahu 3an haadhaa-l-mawDuu3i. I read his book 
that he had written on that subject.)

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
132
Relative pronoun governed by a preposition
In English, relative pronouns can be governed by a preposition. Here are two exam-
ples in English:
The friend about whom I told you is getting married soon.
She sent a letter to the uncle from whom she received the present.
By contrast, Arabic doesn’t put the preposition before the relative pronoun. Instead, 
you move the prepositional phrase into the relative clause and use the object suffix. 
Here are Arabic versions of the preceding English example sentences. I translate them 
into literal English here to show you where to put the prepositions. I’ve underlined 
the prepositions with their object suffixes so you can see how they compare to the 
English:
.ﺍﻟﺼﱠﺪﻳﻖﹸ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺃﹶﺧﹾﺒﹶﺮﹾﺗﹸﻚﹶ ﻋﹶﻨﹾﻪﹸ ﺳﹶﻮﹾﻑﹶ ﻳﹶﺘﹶﺰﹶﻭﱠﺝﹸ ﻗﹶﺮﻳﺒﺎﹰ
(aS-Sadiiqu alladhii ’akhbartuka 3anhu sawfa yatazawwaju qariiban. The friend 
who I told you about him is getting married soon.)
.ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺳﹶﻠﹶﺖﹾ ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﺔﹰ ﻟﹺﻠﹾﺨﺎﻝﹺ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺣﹶﺼﹶﻠﹶﺖﹾ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻬﹶﺪﹺﻳﺔﹺ ﻣﹺﻨﹾﻪﹸ
’(arsalat risaalatan lil-khaali alladhii HaSalat 3ala-l-hadiyati minhu. She sent a 
letter to the uncle who she received the present from him.)
Relative pronoun in the genitive
The relative pronoun in Arabic doesn’t have a genitive case, but you can still use a 
relative clause to describe an antecedent that owns something. In English you use 
whose or of whom to form a relative clause describing ownership. Here’s an example 
in English: The colleague whose proposal we are considering wants to speak before the 
group.
 
To express this sentence in Arabic, use the relative pronoun and put the possessive 
suffix on the object within the relative clause. Here’s an Arabic version of the preced-
ing example sentence. I’ve underlined the possessive suffix to show you how Arabic 
creates a relative pronoun in the genitive:
.ﺍﻟﺰﱠﻣﻴﻞﹸ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﻧﹶﻬﹾﺘﹶﻢﱡ ﺑﹺﺎﹺﻗﹾﺘﹺﺮﺍﺣﹺﻪﹺ ﻳﹸﺮﻳﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶ ﺃﹶﻣﺎﻡﹶ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﺠﹾﻨﺔﹺ
(az-zamiilu alladhii nahtammu bi-’iqtiraaHihi yuriidu ’an yatakallama 
’amaama al-lajnati. The colleague who we are considering his proposal wants to 
speak before the committee.)
 
As you become more experienced with picking the correct relative pronoun for each 
gender, you can take it to the next level by adding the resumptive pronouns. Here’s 
your chance to show off what you know by using these skills! Translate each of the 
following sentences into Arabic. Any words you don’t know are in the dictionary at 
the back of the book.
 Q. The room I entered was very dark.

Examining Relative Clauses 
with Plural Antecedents
A relative clause can have a plural noun as its antecedent. Arabic has plural relative 
pronouns for such occasions. One peculiar grammatical trait of Arabic, however, is 
that the only time you actually use a plural relative pronoun is when the antecedent 
is both plural and animate. An animate object is something alive, either a human or 
even an animal. An inanimate object, by contrast, is something that isn’t living, such 
as a book or a sofa. The dual relative pronouns are the only ones that have different 
forms depending on the case of the pronoun. For your reference, Table 8-1 shows the 
singular and plural forms of the relative pronoun.
Table 8-1 
Singular and Plural Forms of the Relative Pronoun
Singular
Plural
Masculine( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱalladhii; who, whom, that)( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻳﻦﹶalladhiina; who, whom, that)
Feminine( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii; who, whom, that)( ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻮﺍﺗﻲallawaati; who, whom, 
that)

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns

( ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻳﻦﹶalladhiina) with animate plurals
Because you use the masculine plural relative pronouns for any group of humans 
that’s either all male or (as is more common) of mixed gender, the masculine plural 
relative is overwhelmingly the most common plural form. All the rules you observe 
with the singular relative forms apply to its use. The antecedent has to be definite, 
plural, and animate. Consider the following examples:
.ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺮﺍﺳﹺﻠﻮﻥﹶ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻳﻦﹶ ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺒﻮﺍ ﻫﺬﹺﻩﹺ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻘﺎﻟﺔ ﺳﹶﻴﹶﻔﻮﺯﻭﻥﹶ ﺑﹺﺠﺎﺋﹺﺰﹶﺓﹴ
(al-muraasiluuna alladhiina katabuu hadhihi-l-maqaala sayafuuzuuna bi-
jaa’izatin. The correspondents who wrote that article will win an award.)
.ﺳﹶﻠﱠﻤﹾﻨﺎ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﺰﱡﻭﺍﺭﹺ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺬﻳﻦﹶ ﺣﹶﻀﹶﺮﻭﺍ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺤﺎﺿﹶﺮﺓﹶ
(sallamnaa 3ala kulli-z-zuwwaari alladhiina HaDaruu al-muHaaDarata. We 
greeted all the visitors who attended the lecture.)
 
You can additionally modify many plural nouns with the word ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull; all). Here is 
an example:
.ﺭﹶﺃﻯ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲﹸ ﻛﹸﻞﱠ ﺍﻟﺰﱡﻭﹼﺍﺭﹺ
(ra’aa ar-ra’iisu kulla-z-zuwwaari. The president saw all the visitors.)
Even though technically the plural noun is in ’iDaafa with ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) (a singular noun), 
you won’t see grammatical agreement between ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) and relative pronouns. 
Instead, Arabic intuitively uses plural relative pronouns. Here’s an example of a rela-
tive clause with ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull). Note the use of the plural relative pronoun (underlined):
.ﺭﹶﺃﻯ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲﹸ ﻛﹸﻞﱠ ﺍﻟﺰﱡﻭﹼﺍﺭﹺ ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻳﻦﹶ ﺣﹶﻀﹶﺮﻭﺍ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖﹺ ﺍﻷﹶﺑﹾﻴﹶﺾﹺ
(ra’aa ar-ra’iisu kulla-z-zuwwaari alladhiina HaDaruu ’ilaa-l-bayti- al-’abyaDi. 
The president saw all the visitors who came to the White House.)
( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii) with inanimate plurals
When you form a relative clause with inanimate plurals as the antecedent, use the 
feminine singular relative pronoun ( ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲallatii; who, whom, which, that). If you need 
to use resumptive pronouns in these sentences, make sure they’re feminine singular 
as well. Here are two examples:
.ﺑﺎﻉﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﺎﻋﺔﹸ ﻛﹸﻞﱠ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻨﹾﺘﹶﺠﺎﺕﹺ ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲ ﺃﹶﻧﹾﺘﹶﺠﹶﻬﺎ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺼﹾﻨﹶﻊﹸ
(baa3a al-baa3atu kulla-l-muntajaati allatii ’antajahaa al-maSna3u. The sales-
men sold all the products that the factory produced.)
.ﻳﹸﻔﹶﻀﱢﻞﹸ ﺍﻷﹶﻭﹾﻻﺩ ﺍﻟﻜﹸﺘﹸﺐﹶ ﺍﻟﱠﺘﻲ ﻓﻴﻬﺎ ﺍﻟﺼﱡﻮﹶﺭﹸ
(yufaDDilu al-’awlaadu alkutuba allatii fiihaa aS-Suwaur. The children prefer the 
books that have pictures.)

Looking at Other Relative Clauses
The beginning of this chapter shows you how Arabic handles relative clauses when 
the antecedent is a definite noun. But some relative clauses have indefinite anteced-
ents or, for that matter, no stated antecedent at all. In the following sections, I show 
you how to write these kinds of relative clauses.
Indefinite antecedents in relative clauses
 
You form a relative clause with an indefinite antecedent exactly the same way you 
form a relative clause with a definite antecedent, except you don’t use the relative 
pronoun. Because a relative pronoun can only have a definite antecedent, you leave 
the relative pronoun unstated in Arabic. (See the earlier section “Getting to Know the 
Singular Relative Pronoun” for details on how to form a relative clause with a definite 
antecedent.)

Part II: Becoming a Master at Using Nouns 
136
Here are examples of indefinite antecedents in relative clauses. The English transla-
tions have relative pronouns, but there’s no stated word in the Arabic for the relative 
pronoun:
.ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﺔﹰ ﻟﹶﻢ ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺳﹺﻠﹾﻬﺎ
(katabtu risaalatan lam ’ursilhaa. I wrote a letter that I never sent.)
.ﺑﹶﻘﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﻓﻲ ﻓﹸﻨﹾﺪﹸﻕﹴ ﺍﻗﹾﺘﹶﺮﹶﺣﹶﻪﹸ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﻲ ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻲﱠ
(baqaytu fii funduqin iqtaraHahu Sadiiqii 3alayya. I stayed in a hotel that my 
friend had suggested to me.)
Topical antecedents in relative clauses
 
Sometimes the antecedent in a relative clause isn’t a noun that’s stated explicitly in 
the sentence. The very topic of a sentence can become the unstated antecedent. 
Luckily, each of these situations has a relative pronoun that tells you when to expect 
a relative clause without a stated antecedent. To help you spot the relative pronouns 
in this section, I underline them in the Arabic and the English.
Who
The particle ( ﻣﹶﻦﹾman; who) can serve as a relative pronoun in cases where you want 
to form a relative clause referring to a previously unmentioned human or animate 
object. Here’s an example of a sentence using this particle:
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺠﹸﻤﹾﻬﻮﺭﹺ ﻣﹶﻦ ﺑﹶﺤﹶﺚﹶ ﻋﹶﻦ ﺇﹺﺟﺎﺑﺔﹴ
(kaana fii-l-jumhuuri man baHatha 3an ’ijaabatin. There was in the crowd some-
one who sought an answer.)
What
The word ( ﻣﺎmaa; what) stands as a relative pronoun for indefinite objects that are 
unstated. Consider this example:
.ﺩﹶﻋﹶﻤﹾﺖﹸ ﻣﺎ ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺐﹶ ﺍﻟﺼﱡﺤﹸﻔﻲﱡ
(da3amtu maa kataba aS-SuHufiyyu. I supported what the reporter wrote.)
Which
The word ( ﻣﹺﻤﹼﺎmimmaa; which), which is the contraction of ( ﻣﹺﻦmin; from) and  ﻣﺎ
(maa; what), can serve as a relative pronoun. It stands for concepts or ideas raised 
within the first part of the sentence. Check out the following example:
.ﻗﹶﺮﱠﺭﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺱﹶ ﻓﻲ ﺑﺎﺭﻳﺲ ﻣﹺﻤﹼﺎ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﺰﹶﻥﹶ ﺃﹸﻣﱠﻪﹸ
(qarrara ’an yadrusa fii-baariis mimmaa ’aHzana ’ummahu. He decided to study 
in Paris, which saddened his mother.)

Staying Active: Forming 
Arabic Verbs

In this part . . .
I
f you like to be part of the action, this is the part for 
you. It’s where you find everything you need to write 
verbs of every size, shape, and especially, form in Arabic. 
The ten forms of the Arabic verb will bow to your com-
mand after you master them here. I introduce those pesky 
irregular verbs as well, but I show you that deep down 
they’re manageable, too. Discovering how to add an object 
to your verb helps you polish your writing skills, so I 
include a chapter on the object suffix. Finally, in this part, 
you break out of the basic world of indicative verbs and 
take on the task of using the subjunctive and the jussive 
when Arabic calls for it.

Chapter 9
Forms and Functions: 
The Forms of the Arabic Verb
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the structure of the Arabic verb forms
 Producing the past and present of the verb forms
E
very language has basic verbs to describe the actions of the world. But beyond 
simply using basic verbs, such as eat, run, and sleep, each language also has ways 
to nuance descriptions. In English, for example, you can refine verbs with preposi-
tions, to produce statements such as eat out, run on, and sleep in. In some cases, just 
adding a preposition produces an idiomatic meaning quite separate from the basic 
verb by itself.
Similarly, Arabic has a way to change basic verbal roots to produce multiple mean-
ings. Arabic, however, adds various prefixes, vowels, and doubled consonants to gen-
erate meanings such as to cause to do something, to seek to do something, or to be 
done. So in this chapter, you discover how to apply the changes that turn a verbal 
root into any of the different word patterns, creating various shades of meaning or 
even whole new verbs in the process.
Understanding the Forms of the Arabic Verb
The nine word patterns you read about in this chapter are called forms by English lan-
guage linguists. These forms are usually distinguished by the use of Roman numerals, 
which is the convention that I use in this book. You likely became acquainted with 
the common Form I in your basic studies of Arabic. (If not, you can find a refresher on 
Form I in Chapter 2.)
 
An Arabic verb form is a word pattern created by the addition of extra consonants or 
long vowels. These extra elements, depending on the form, are added to the verbal 
root at the beginning of the word or in between the consonants of the verbal root.
Each of the forms has specific features that you’ll come to recognize and associate 
with that form. I highlight the features for you in this chapter. This treatment of the 
features will allow you to remember the traits that can help you recognize a given 
form.

144
Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
In order to understand how Arabic can create different meanings through elements 
such as prefixes, consider by analogy a similar development in English. The English 
language inherited numerous verbs from Latin, and these verbs come to the language 
already carrying various prepositional prefixes that radically change their meanings. 
Nowadays we don’t even think about how some of these verbs are related to one 
another. Words have specific meanings for us in English today that aren’t readily 
apparent from their etymologies alone.
For example, from Latin capere, meaning to take, we get these words: receive, con-
ceive, and perceive. Similarly, from Latin mittere, meaning to send, we get remit, com-
mit, and permit. And from Latin formare, meaning to form, we get reform, conform, and 
perform.
Form II
Form II is a common and easily recognizable verb form. As you’re about to see, 
there’s a visual flag on a Form II verb that helps you determine that you do, in fact, 
have a Form II verb on your hands. Here are the distinct traits of Form II:
 
 The second consonant of the root doubles, which is written by placing a   ﹼ
(shadda) over the second consonant. Only two of the Arabic verb forms will 
have a (  ﹼshadda) over the second consonant — Forms II and V. And Form V will 
have an additional prefix that Form II doesn’t have.
 
 A (  ﹺkasra) is added under the second consonant of the root in the present tense.
 
 A (  ﹸDamma) is added over the present tense prefixes.
Forget what the kasra, Damma, and shadda are? Check out Chapter 3.
The meaning of Form II
Form II can affect the root meaning of a verb in two ways. In some cases, it seems to 
imply an intensifying of the action. For example, consider the Form I verb,  ﻛﹶﺴﹶﺮﹶ
(kasara), which means to break. The intensified Form II version of this verb is  ﻛﹶﺴﱠﺮﹶ
(kassara), which means to shatter/smash. Here’s an example sentence using this verb:
.ﻛﹶﺴﱠﺮﹶﺕﹾ ﺍﻹﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶﺓﹸ ﺍﻟﻐﹶﻀﹾﺒﺎﻧﹶﺔﹸ ﺍﻟﺰﱡﺟﺎﺟﹶﺔﹶ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻷﹶﺭﹾﺽﹺ
(kassarat al-’imra’atu al-ghaDbaanatu az-zujaajata 3alaa-l-’arDi. The angry 
woman smashed the bottle on the ground.)

145
 Chapter 9: Forms and Functions: The Forms of the Arabic Verb
Other verbs in Form II are causative. For instance, the Form I verb, ( ﺩﹶﺭﹶﺱﹶdarasa; to 
learn), changes in Form II to ( ﺩﹶﺭﱠﺱﹶdarrasa), which means to teach (or to cause to 
learn). Check out this example sentence:
.ﺃﹶﺷﹾﻜﹸﺮﹸ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞ ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﺩﹶﺭﱠﺳﹶﻨﻲ ﺍﻟﻠﱡﻐﺔﹶ ﺍﻟﻌﹶﺮﹶﺑﹺﻴﹼﺔ
’(ashkuru ar-rajula alladhii darrasanii al-lughata al-3arabiyyata. I thank the 
man who taught me the Arabic langauge.)
 
You can observe the intensifying meaning of Form II when you compare Form I  ﻛﹶﺴﹶﺮﹶ
 
(kasara; to break) to Form II ( ﻛﹶﺴﱠﺮﹶkassara; to shatter). But that doesn’t mean you can 
take just any verbal root and put it into Form II with the intention of intensifying the 
meaning. In other words, a verbal root may occur in Form II or it may not. And if a 
verbal root doesn’t occur in Form II, you can’t create a new verb by putting it into 
Form II.
Producing Form II
Here are some other common and important verbs that occur in Form II. Unlike  ﻛﹶﺴﱠﺮﹶ
(kassara; to shatter), these verbs don’t have any apparent meaning imparted to them 
by Form II:
( ﺳﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶsallama; to greet)
( ﻏﹶﻴﱠﺮﹶghayyara; to change)
The following are some examples using these verbs:
.ﺳﹶﻠﱢﻢﹾ ﻟﻲ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺯﹶﻭﹾﺟﹶﺘﹺﻚﹶ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹶ
(sallim lii 3alaa zawjatika min faDlika. Please convey my greetings to your wife.)
.ﻏﹶﻴﱠﺮﺕﹸ ﺭﹶﺃﹾﻳﻲ ﺳﹶﺮﻳﻌﺎﹰ
(ghayyartu ra’yii sarii3an. I changed my opinion quickly.)
 
To produce Form II, you apply the steps I show you in the introduction to this sec-
tion. All Arabic verb forms take the same suffixes and prefixes to form their past and 
present tenses. (If you’re interested in reviewing past and present tense formation, 
you can visit Chapter 2.)
The following tables show the conjugation of ( ﺩﹶﺭﱠﺱﹶdarrasa; to teach), which is a Form 
II verb. I show the conjugation in both past and present tense.

The best way to internalize your production of each verb form in this chapter is to 
apply the steps you discover in each section immediately after you encounter them. 
For this exercise, I give you a pronoun and a verbal root. Write the past and present 
tenses of the Form II verb that correspond to the verbal root and the supplied pro-
noun in each item.

Form III
These are the distinct features of Form III:
 
 A long a vowel — written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — comes after the first consonant of 
the root.
 
 A (  ﹺkasra) is added under the second consonant in the present tense.
 
 A (  ﹸDamma) is added over the prefixes in the present tense.
To read more about the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), flip to Chapter 3.
The meaning of Form III
Form III generally imparts a meaning of trying to do something. For example, consider 
the Form I verb, ( ﺷﹶﻬﹺﺪﹶshahida; to witness). The Form III version, ( ﺷﺎﻫﹶﺪﹶshaahada) 
means to watch or to try to witness something. Another example is the Form I verb 
( ﺻﹶﺪﹶﻕﹶSadaqa; to speak the truth). The Form III version of this verb is ( ﺻﺎﺩﹶﻕﹶSaadaqa), 
meaning to befriend, consent.
Here are examples of sentences using these verbs:
.ﺷﺎﻫﹶﺪﹾﻧﺎ ﻓﹺﻠﻤﺎﹰ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ
(shaahadnaa filman ’amsi. We watched a movie yesterday.)
.ﺻﹶﺎﺩﹶﻗﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﺭﹶ ﺍﻟﱠﺬﻱ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻋﹶﺪﹸﻭﹼﺍﹰ ﻟﻲ
(Saadaqtu al-jaara alladhii kaana 3aduwwan lii. I befriended the neighbor who 
used to be my enemy.)
Here are three other useful verbs that occur in Form III:
( ﺭﺍﻓﹶﻖﹶraafaqa; to accompany)
( ﺷﺎﺭﹶﻙﹶshaaraka; to share/take part in)

(hal turaafiqunii ’ilaa-s-suuqi? Will you accompany me to the store?)
.ﻳﹸﺸﺎﺭﹺﻙﹸ ﺍﻟﻌﹸﻤﹼﺎﻝ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻀﱠﺮﹾﺏ
(yushaariku al-3ummaal fi-D-Darb. The workers are taking part in the strike.)
Producing Form III
The main distinguishing feature of Form III is the long a vowel, written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), 
after the first consonant of your root. It’s visible in both the present and past tenses.
The following tables show the conjugation of the Form III verb ( ﺗﺎﺑﹶﻊﹶtaaba3a; to con-

Form IV
Form IV is unusual because its past and present tenses each have different distinctive 
traits that you use to spot a verb in that category. The features of a Form IV verb are:
 
 A prefixed ’( ﺃﹶa) is added in the past tense only.
 
 A (  ﹸDamma) is added over the prefixes in the present tense.
 
 A (  ﹺkasra) is added under the second consonant in the present tense.
The meaning of Form IV
Form IV reliably gives a causative meaning to a verbal root. In other words, if your 
verb root means to cook, the Form IV of that verb root would mean to cause someone 
to cook (make someone cook). For example, consider the Form I verb ( ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹶqara’a), 
which means to read. The Form IV version of this word is ’( ﺃﹶﻗﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶaqra’a), meaning to 
make someone read. Another example is the Form I verb ( ﻋﹶﻤﹺﻞﹶ3amila; to work). The 
Form IV version of this verb is ’( ﺃﹶﻋﹾﻤﹶﻞﹶa3mala), meaning to put to work.

150
Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
The following are some example sentences that use these verbs:
ﻫﹶﻞ ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹾﺕﹺ ﻗﹺﺼﱠﺘﹶﻬﺎ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺪﻳﺪﺓ؟

(laa. li’anna mudarrisatanaa maa ’aqra’atnaa haadhihi-l-qiSSa. No. Because our 
teacher didn’t make us read this story.)
These are some other useful verbs that occur in Form IV:
’( ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺳﹶﻞﹶarsala; to send)
’( ﺃﻋﹾﻠﹶﻦﹶa3lana; to announce/advertise)
Here are some sentences using these Form IV verbs:
.ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺳﹺﻞﹾ ﻟﻲ ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﺔﹰ ﺣﻴﻦﹶ ﺗﹶﺤﹾﺼﹸﻞ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻨﱠﺘﺎﺋﹺﺞ

(yu3linu aT-Tayaraan 3an wuSuul Taa’iratihi al-qaadima min baariis. The air-
line is announcing the arrival of their plane coming from Paris.)
Producing Form IV
 
Make sure to study the past and present tenses of the Form IV verb separately and 
internalize the different look and feel of them. In the past tense, note the use of the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) prefix. In the present tense, observe how the Form IV verb differs from 
Form I in the vowels alone.
The following tables show the conjugation of the Form IV verb ’( ﺃﹶﻛﹾﻤﹶﻞﹶakmala), which 
means to finish. I show the conjugation in both past and present tenses.

To help you improve your use of Forms IV, your teacher designed a matching exer-
cise. You have a word bank with seven verbs in Form IV. Match each one with the 
sentence that fits the meaning best. Note: The exact form in the word bank isn’t what 
you need to fill in the blank, because the context of the sentence will prompt you for 
a specific tense and person of the verb. Each verb will make the best sense in only 
one place.

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
Form V
Form V is a very recognizable form. Form V presents the following distinct features:
 
 A ( ﺗﹶta-) is prefixed onto the root.
 
 The second consonant of the root is doubled.
 
 A (  ﹶfatHa) is added over the present tense prefixes.
 
 A (  ﹶfatHa) is added over the second consonant of the root in both the present 
and past tenses.
The meaning of Form V
Form V serves as the reflexive or passive counterpart to Form II. What I mean is that 
when you have a verbal root in Form V, the same root will usually have a Form II with 
a similar meaning. Form V will be the reflexive (where the action is done by the sub-
jects on themselves) or passive (where the action is done to the subject). For 
instance, consider the Form I verb ( ﻋﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶ3allama; to teach). The Form V version of 
this verb is ( ﺗﹶﻌﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶta3allama), which means to learn (or to be taught). The following is 
a sentence using this Form V verb:
ﺃﹶﺗﹶﻌﹶﻠﱠﻤﹾﺖﹶ ﺳﹺﺮﱠ ﺍﻟﻨﱠﺠﺎﺡﹺ؟
’(ata3allamta sirra an-najaaHi? Have you learned the secret of success?)
Here are some other useful verbs that occur in Form V:
( ﺗﹶﻌﹶﺮﱠﻑﹶta3arrafa; to get to know/meet/become acquainted)
( ﺗﹶﻀﹶﻤﱠﻦﹶtaDammana; to include/contain)
The following are some example sentences that show you how these Form V verbs 
are used:
.ﺗﹶﻌﹶﺮﱠﻓﹾﺖﹸ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺟﺎﺭﻱ
(ta3arraftu 3alaa jaarii. I made the acquaintance of my neighbor.)
.ﻳﹶﺘﹶﻀﹶﻤﱠﻦﹸ ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏ ﻣﹶﻌﹾﻠﻮﻣﺎﺕ ﻣﹸﻬﹺﻤﹼﺔ
(yataDammanu al-kitaab ma3luumaat muhimma. The book contains important 
information.)
Producing Form V
The Form V verb has the same distinctive doubling as the Form II verb, but it addi-
tionally has the distinctive ( ﺗﹶta-) prefix.

Form VI
Form VI is produced by:
 
 Adding a prefixed ( ﺗﹶta-)
 
 Inserting a long a vowel after the first consonant of the root
 
 Using a (  ﹶfatHa) over the second consonant in both the present and past tenses
 
 Using a (  ﹶfatHa) over the prefixes in the present tense
The meaning of Form VI
Form VI is the reciprocal counterpart to Form III. Here’s what I mean: If a verb is 
in Form VI, it describes people exchanging the action of a verb that exists in Form III. 
For example, consider the Form III verb ( ﺣﺎﺭﹶﺏﹶHaaraba), which means to fight. The 
Form VI version of this verb is ( ﺗﹶﺤﺎﺭﹶﺏﹶtaHaaraba), which means to fight one another.
The following is an example sentence that uses this verb:
.ﺗﹶﺤﺎﺭﹶﺏﹶ ﺍﻟﺠﹸﻨﻮﺩ ﻛﹸﻞﱠ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻴﹾﻠﺔﹺ
(taHaaraba al-junuud kulla-l-laylati. The soldiers fought one another all night.)
Here are some other useful verbs that occur in Form VI:
( ﺗﹶﺴﺎﻟﹶﻢﹶtasaalama; to make peace with one another)
( ﺗﹶﺴﺎﺀﹶﻝﹶtasaa’ala; to ask oneself/inquire)
Take a look at these example sentences:
.ﺗﹶﺴﺎﻟﹶﻢﹶ ﺍﻷﹶﻋﹾﺪﺍﺀ ﺃﹶﺧﻴﺮﺍﹰ
(tasaalama al-’a3daa’ ’akhiiran. The enemies finally reconciled.)
.ﺗﹶﺴﺎﺀﹶﻟﹾﺖﹸ ﻫﹶﻞﹾ ﺳﹶﺄﹶﺫﹾﻫﹶﺐﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻔﹾﻠﹶﺔﹺ ﺃﹶﻡﹾ ﻻ
(tasaa’altu hal sa-’adh-hab ’ilaa-l-Haflati ’am laa. I asked myself whether I would 
go to the party or not.)

Producing Form VI
 
Watch for the long a vowel — written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — and the prefixed ( ﺗﹶta-) as the 
key points of Form VI.
The following tables show the conjugation of the Form VI verb ( ﺗﹶﺒﺎﺩﹶﻝﹶtabaadala), 
which means to exchange. I show the conjugation in both the past and present tenses.

Form VII
To create Form VII, you have to:
 
 Prefix a ( ﻥnuun) to the verb
 
 Prefix an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) + (   ﹺkasra) before the ( ﻥnuun) in the past tense
 
 Add a (  ﹶfatHa) over the prefixes in the present tense
 
 Add a (   ﹺkasra) under the second consonant of the root in the present tense
The meaning of Form VII
Form VII is relatively rare and can impart a passive meaning. In other words, when it 
exists, it means the action is done to the subject of the verb. For example, consider 
the Form I verb ( ﻛﹶﺴﹶﺮﹶkasara), meaning to break (something). The Form VII version of 
this verb is ( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﻜﹶﺴﹶﺮﹶinkasara), which means to be broken.
The following sentence shows how you can use this verb:
.ﺍﹺﻧﹾﻜﹶﺴﹶﺮﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﺎﺏ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﻓﹶﺘﹶﺤﹾﺘﹸﻪﹸ
(inkasara al-baab 3indamaa fataHtuhu. The door became broken when I 
opened it.)
Here are some other common and important verbs that occur in Form VII:
( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﺪﹶﻟﹶﻊﹶindala3a; to break out [war, fire])
( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﺒﹶﻐﻰinbaghaa; to be incumbent upon)
Consider the following sentences, which show you how to use these common Form 
VII verbs:
.ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹸ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﺍﹺﻧﹾﺪﹶﻟﹶﻌﹶﺖﹾ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﺮﹾﺏ
(kuntu hunaak 3indamaa indala3at al-Harb. I was there when the war broke out.)

 Chapter 9: Forms and Functions: The Forms of the Arabic Verb
.ﻳﹶﻨﹾﺒﹶﻐﻲ ﻟﻲ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺃﹶﺗﹶﻌﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶ ﺍﻟﻌﹶﺮﹶﺑﹺﻴﹼﺔ
(yanbaghii lii ’an ’ata3allama al-3arabiyya. I must learn Arabic.)
Producing Form VII
The feature of a Form VII verb is the prefixing of the ( ﻥnuun). In the past, there’s the 
additional ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) before the ( ﻥnuun). In the present, you find the ( ﻥnuun) 
between the normal present tense prefix and the first consonant of your root.
The following tables show the conjugation of the Form VII verb ( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﻜﹶﺴﹶﺮinkasara), 
which means to get broken. I show the conjugation in both past and present tenses.

Form VII verbs are rare, but knowing how to form them will be a boon when you 
really need one. For this exercise, I give you a pronoun and a verbal root. Write the 
past and present tenses of the Form VII verb that correspond to the verbal root and 
pronoun in each item.

Form VIII
Form VIII has the following distinct features:
 
 A ( ﺗﹶta-) is inserted after the first consonant of the root.
 
 You have to prefix an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) + (   ﹺkasra) to the verb in the past tense.
 
 You use a (  ﹶfatHa) over the prefixes in the present tense.
 
 You use a (   ﹺkasra) under the second consonant of the root in the present tense.
The meaning of Form VIII
Form VIII can be reflexive or passive. For example, consider the Form I verb  ﺭﹶﻓﹶﻊﹶ
(rafa3a; to lift). The Form VIII version of this verb is ( ﺍﹺﺭﹾﺗﹶﻔﹶﻊﹶirtafa3a), which means 
to rise.
The following is a sentence showing the use of this verb:
.ﺍﹺﺭﹾﺗﹶﻔﹶﻊﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﺎﻟﻮﻥﹸ ﻓﹶﻮﹾﻕﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﺎﻳﺔﹺ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻮﻳﻠﺔﹺ
(irtafa3a al-baaluunu fawqa-l-binaayati aT-Tawiilati. The balloon rose over the 
tall building.)
Here are some other useful verbs that occur in Form VIII:
( ﺍﹺﺟﹾﺘﹶﻤﹶﻊﹶijtama3a; to meet [together])
( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻞﹶintaqala; to move)
Check out these example sentences:
.ﺳﹶﺘﹶﺠﹾﺘﹶﻤﹺﻊﹸ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﺠﹾﻨﺔ ﻣﹶﺮﱠﺗﹶﻴﹾﻦ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﻬﹾﺮ ﺍﻟﻘﺎﺩﹺﻡ
(satajtami3u al-lajna marratayn fish-shahr alqaadim. The committee will meet 
twice in the coming month.)
.ﺍﹺﻧﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻠﹶﺖﹾ ﻋﺎﺋﹺﻠﹶﺘﻲ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺖﹴ ﺟﹶﺪﻳﺪﹴ
(intaqalat 3aa’ilatii ’ilaa baytin jadiidin. My family moved into a new house.)

159
 Chapter 9: Forms and Functions: The Forms of the Arabic Verb
Producing Form VIII
 
Form VIII is the only Arabic verb form with what’s called an infix. This means that the 
extra element, the consonant t, is inserted between the first and second consonants 
of the root. Be careful not to mistake a Form VIII verb for a verb with a ( ﺕtaa’) as 
part of its root. Also be on the lookout for how similar a Form VIII verb with ( ﺱsiin) 
as its first letter will look to a Form X verb. (You can read more about Form X later in 
this chapter.)
The following tables show the conjugation of perhaps the most common Form VIII 
verb, ( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻤﹶﻊﹶistama3a), which means to listen. I show the conjugation in both past 
and present tenses.

Form IX
 
Form IX exists in Arabic, but it occurs rarely. It’s a way to describe the action of 
acquiring either a color or a bodily defect. Just so that you can recognize it if you 
ever come across it, the one distinct feature of a Form IX verb is a doubling of the 
third consonant in the verbal root, which is written by placing a (  ﹼshadda) over the 
 
third consonant. For example, consider the Form II verb ( ﺣﹶﻤﱠﺮﹶHammara; to redden). 
 
The Form IX version of this verb is ( ﺍﹺﺣﹾﻤﹶﺮﱠiHmarra), which means to turn red.
For your reference, here are sample forms of the past and present tenses of a Form IX 
verb:
Past Tense: ( ﺍﹺﺣﹾﻤﹶﺮﱠhuwa iHmarra; he turned red)
Present Tense: ( ﺗﹶﺤﹾﻤﹶﺮﱡhiya taHmarru; she turns red)
Now check out this example of a Form IX verb in a sentence:
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﻮﹼ ﺣﺎﺭﹼﺍﹰ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ ﻓﹶﻬﹺﻲﹶ ﺍﹺﺣﹾﻤﹶﺮﱠﺕﹾ ﻣﹺﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﻤﹾﺲﹺ
(kaana-l-jawu Haarran jiddan fa-hiya iHmarrat mina-sh-shamsi. The weather 
was very hot, and so she turned red from the sun.)

161
 Chapter 9: Forms and Functions: The Forms of the Arabic Verb
Form X
Form X involves the following distinct features:
 
 Prefixing ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) to the verb
 
 Prefixing an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) + (   ﹺkasra) before the ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) prefix in the past tense
 
 Using (  ﹶfatHa) over the present tense prefixes
 
 Using (   ﹺkasra) under the second consonant of the root in the present tense
The meaning of Form X
Form X implies the act of seeking for the action described by the verbal root. For 
example, consider the Form II verb ( ﻓﹶﺴﱠﻞﹶfassala; to explain). The Form X version of 
this verb is ( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻔﹾﺴﹶﻞﹶistafsala), which means to seek an explanation.
Here’s an example sentence using this form of the verb:
.ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﻔﹾﻬﹶﻢﹾ ﻛﹶﻴﹾﻒﹶ ﺣﹶﺪﹶﺛﹶﺖﹾ ﺍﻟﺤﺎﺩﹺﺛﺔ ﻓﹶﻬﹸﻮﹶ ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻔﹾﺴﹶﺮﹶ  ﻋﹶﻦﹾ ﺍﻷﹶﺳﹾﺒﺎﺏﹺ
(lam yafham kayfa Hadathat al-Haaditha, fa-huwa istafsara 3an al-’asbaabi. He 
didn’t understand how the accident occurred, so he sought an explanation as to the 
causes.)
These are some other common and important verbs that occur in Form X:
( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﺸﹾﻬﹶﺪistash-hada; to be martyred/die in battle)
( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻐﹾﺮﹶﻕﹶistaghraqa; to take/last)
Check out the following sentences, which are examples of uses of these verbs:
.ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﺸﹾﻬﹶﺪﹶ ﺃﹶﻟﹾﻒ ﺟﹸﻨﹾﺪﻱ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻌﹾﺮﹶﻛﺔ
(istash-hada alf jundi fii-l-ma3raka. A thousand soldiers died in the battle.)
.ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻐﹾﺮﹶﻗﹶﺖﹾ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺣﹾﻠﺔ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻣﹶﻴﹾﻦﹺ
(istaghraqat ar-riHla yawmayni. The trip took two days.)
Producing Form X
 
Form X is one of the easiest forms to identify, because it includes a two-consonant 
 
prefix ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) before the three consonants of the verbal root. In the past tense, 
 
you add the ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) prefix, and then you add an additional short i vowel before 
 
that prefix, which is written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) and (   ﹺkasra). In the present tense, you 
 
add the ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) prefix and then add the same present tense prefixes used for all 
 
the forms directly before the ( ﺳﹾﺖﹶsta-) prefix.

162
Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
The following tables show the conjugation of the Form X verb ( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻌﹾﻤﹶﻞﹶista3mala; to 
use). The overall root meaning of ( ﻋﻤﻞ3-m-l) is to work, so in Form X it means to seek 
to work, or to use. I show the conjugation in both the past and present tenses.

f you grew up speaking English, you never had to think about how maddeningly 
irregular the language can be. People who learn English as a second language don’t 
have it so easy. They learn that if you want to put a verb in the past tense, you can 
just add -ed, such as in walked. But if the verb already ends in e, you just add a d, as in 
baked. If only that were the end of it! Instead you come across words like see, which 
in the past tense is saw. The last straw comes when you realize that with go, the past 
tense (went) is from a completely different verb. Every language has its irregularities, 
but English is among the worst offenders.
 
So you won’t be surprised to find out that Arabic also has irregular forms. Unlike 
English, however, the so-called irregularity in Arabic just amounts to a different set of 
rules when a few of the consonants appear in a verb. This chapter shows you how to 
confidently form any Arabic verb, regardless of these pesky irregularities.
Grasping Verb Weakness in Arabic
 
The verbs you encounter in this chapter are irregular in the sense that they don’t play by 
the same rules as the so-called “regular” verbs (see Chapters 2 and 9 for more on these run-
of-the-mill verbs). Many Arabic grammar books prefer to call these irregular verbs weak. 
There’s a good reason for using that adjective to refer to these verbs. You probably recall 
from your basic Arabic studies that Arabic verbs have three consonants onto which you 
add the various suffixes and prefixes to indicate who’s performing the action of the verb.
Just a few consonants, however, are soft enough in their pronunciation that they 
can’t quite carry the vowels the same way as the others. For example, a w is a whole 
lot weaker in pronunciation than, say, a d. With a w, you’re bending air in your mouth, 

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
168
but you aren’t touching your tongue against something as you do with letters such as 
d. The three Arabic consonants that yield irregularities from the expected forms are 
the ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), and the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’).
In this chapter, I show you the forms of weak verbs in their past and present tenses. 
Other chapters in this book cover forms of the verb, such as imperative forms 
(Chapter 11), verbal nouns (Chapter 15), and participles (Chapter 18). The weak verb 
forms of each of those are discussed in their respective chapters.
Discovering Initial Weak Verbs
Weak consonants can affect a verb no matter where they appear in a sentence. So in 
this section, I show you the various problems that weak consonants cause when they 
come in the first, or initial, position.
Verbs with initial ( ﺀhamza)
Verbs with an initial glottal stop, which is written with a ( ﺀhamza), have the least 
amount of change overall from the regular pattern. A glottal stop is that little catch 
you have in the back of your throat before you start a word with a vowel. Even 
though we don’t think of the glottal stop as a consonant in English, in Arabic it’s 
treated as such. It may seem surprising to you that something we don’t even see as a 
consonant is still able to carry almost all the normal vowels of the Arabic verb.
 
The irregularity of the initial hamza verb stems from the inability of Arabic to have 
 
two ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalifs) in a row. Forms such as the first person singular present in Form I 
and all the past tense of Form IV replace the two ’alifs with a ( ﺁmadda). (For more 
information on the madda, see Chapter 3.) The only other thing to be on the look out 
for with initial hamza verbs is the change in spelling when the hamza appears over 
the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaw) seat in the present tense of Forms II, III, and IV.
The hamza with Form I verbs
The following tables showing the past and present conjugations of the common Form 
I verb ( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻞﹶakala; to eat) demonstrate how an initial hamza verb behaves.

’( ﺗﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻞﹸanta ta’kulu)
’( ﺗﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﻴﻦﹶanti ta’kuliina)
’( ﺗﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﻮﻥﹶantum ta’kuluuna)
’( ﺗﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﹾﻦﹶantunna ta’kulna)
( ﻳﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻞﹸhuwa ya’kulu)
( ﺗﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻞﹸhiya ta’kulu)
( ﻳﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﻮﻥﹶhum ya’kuluuna)

.ﺁﻛﹸﻞﹸ ﺍﻟﺨﹸﺒﹾﺰ ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ
’(aakulu al-khubz kull yawm. I eat bread every day.)
As you can see from the previous tables, there’s only one form in the present tense where 
a verb with an initial hamza isn’t what you would have expected. That form is the first per-
son singular. Here’s why: Arabic doesn’t permit two ’alifs to stand next to one another. 
Because of that fact, the first person singular form replaces the double ’alif with a madda.
The hamza with Form II verbs
Form II is a case where the initial hamza will only cause spelling irregularity. An initial 
hamza in a Form II verb is normal in the past tense, but it uses the waaw seat in the 
present. The following tables show the past and present conjugations of the Form II 
verb ’( ﺃﹶﺧﱠﺮﹶakhkhara; to delay).

Take note of the present tense in the previous table, and get used to seeing the 
hamza over a waaw seat outside of Form I. Anytime there’s a (  ﹸDamma), the hamza 
will be written over a waaw as you see in the table.
The hamza with Form III and IV verbs
In Forms III and IV, the spelling irregularities of the hamza will be shown in two ways. 
First, the inability to have two consecutive ’alifs forces the use of a madda in the past 
tense of a Form III or IV verb. Secondly, the hamza is written over a waaw seat in the 
present of a Form III or Form IV verb. The following tables show the past and present 
conjugations for the Form IV verb ’( ﺁﻛﹶﻞﹶaakala; to feed).

(tu’kilunaa falaafil 3aadatan 3indamaa nazuuruhaa. She usually feeds us falafel when we visit her.)
Looking at the table showing the past tense, just remember that whenever you have a 
madda, it’s because Arabic doesn’t like two ’alifs in a row. So an initial madda is an 
excellent hint that the first consonant of the verb is an ’alif.
 
The simple act of writing out the irregular verbs immediately after you study each 
type helps lock them in your memory. So in this exercise, write the past and present 
tenses for each root, pronoun, and form of the verb as indicated.

Verbs with initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw)
The ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) is a weak wittle wetter. You’re going to see it behave in three ways. It 
will disappear entirely in some cases, assimilate into a doubled t in others, and just 
turn into a long u vowel elsewhere. An initial waaw causes significantly more changes 
to a verb than the initial hamza, which is described earlier in the chapter.
 
Some grammarians call initial waaw verbs assimilating verbs, because, as I said, 
assimilation is one of the things that an initial waaw verb will do. Other linguists, 
myself included, prefer to label all the irregular verbs with their most accurate 
description. If the issue is an initial waaw, that’s what I call the verb.
The waaw with Form I verbs
In Form I, the waaw disappears in the present tense, but is stable in the past tense. In 
the following tables, I show you an example of how the waaw behaves with the Form I 
verb ( ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶwaSala; to arrive). The conjugations are shown in the following tables.

Note the present tense in the previous table. Whenever you have a verb that seems to 
be missing a consonant to make up a nice triliteral root, consider the possibility that 
it’s an initial waaw like you see here.
The waaw with Form IV verbs
Verbs with initial waaw are completely regular in Forms II and III, so we can skip over 
those. .( ﺍﻟﺤﹶﻤﹾﺪﹸ ﷲﹺﹶal-Hamdu lillah. Praise God.) But in Form IV, an initial waaw 
causes some problems in the present tense. What you’ll see is that the waaw becomes 
a long u vowel following the prefix. Take a look at the following conjugation tables for 
the Form IV verb ’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾﺿﹶﺢﹶawDaHa; to make clear/explain).

Notice that in the past tense, the initial waaw verb is regular in Form IV. But it turns 
into a long u vowel (written with waaw) in the present tense.
The waaw with Form VIII verbs
The initial waaw is regular in Forms V, VI, and VII. But if you thought regularity would 
run the table, think again! In Form VIII, an initial waaw assimilates into the ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’) 
you put after the first consonant in Form VIII, producing a doubled taa’ in both the
past and present tenses. The doubled taa’ is written with a (  ﹼshadda). (For more on 
doubled letters, consult the information on the shadda in Chapter 3.) An example in 
which this happens is the verb ’( ﺇﺗﱠﺼﹶﻞﹶittaSala; to call), which is shown in the follow-
ing conjugation tables.

Make sure to remember that an initial waaw verb in Form VIII is one of the few that has 
its particular irregularity in both past and present tenses. That doubled taa’ turns into 
your friend when you realize it’s a huge red flag for an initial waaw verb in Form VIII.
 
Here’s your chance to produce the most irregular of the initial waaw forms. In this

Getting to Know Medial Weak Verbs
In this section, you meet the most challenging type of irregular verbs in Arabic: the 
medial weak verbs. Medial simply means in the middle. Why is this name significant? 
Well, as you know, most Arabic verbs (and nouns) are made up of three consonants. 
When the middle consonant is a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or a ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), more often than not something 
besides a waaw or a yaa’ is used in that place. However, the original waaw or yaa’ may 
reappear in some of the forms. You’ll see some books call these hollow verbs, because the 
medial waaw or yaa’ will sometimes give the appearance that the verb is hollowed out.
Verbs with medial waaw
Verbs that have medial waaw are more common than verbs with medial yaa’, so I 
start with them. For some reason, the statistics overall in the Arabic language are that 
the yaa’ as an actual consonant in the triliteral root is fairly rare. In the following sec-
tion, I explain how the medial waaw behaves in each of the forms affected by it.
The medial waaw in Form I
In Form I, the medial waaw can take two different shapes. In one shape, the medial 
waaw will tend to stay as either a long or short u vowel. The important and useful verb ( ﻗﺎﻝﹶqaala; to say) — which comes from the root ( ﻗﻮﻝq-w-l) — behaves this way.
Here are the features of a medial waaw verb that prefers the long or short u vowel in 
place of the waaw:

 Chapter 10: Exploring Irregularity in Arabic Verbs 175
 
 The waaw only appears in the present tense and even then only as a long u vowel.
 
 The long u vowel in the present tense is reduced to a (  ﹸDamma) in the two femi-
nine plural forms.
 
 In the past tense, you see a long a whenever the final consonant l has a vowel 
and a short u whenever the final consonant has a (  ﹾsukuun).
The following tables show the past and present conjugations of ( ﻗﺎﻝﹶqaala; to say).

(taquulu an-nisaa’ ’innahunna muwaafiqaat ma3aki. The women say that they agree with you.)
Make sure to notice that in the present tense, you can see all three consonants of the 
root in all but the feminine plural forms.
The verb ( ﻧﺎﻡﹶnaama; to sleep) shows you the second style a verb with medial waaw 
can display in Form I. Here, the medial waaw will become an a or i vowel. The features 
of verbs like ( ﻧﺎﻡﹶnaama) are:
 
 Instead of a Damma in the past tense, you use a (   ﹺkasra).
 
 In the present tense, you have a long a vowel (written with an ’[ ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif]) in 
place of the long u (written with waaw).
 
 The feminine plural forms reduce the long a to a (  ﹶfatHa).
To read more about the Damma, kasra, and fatHa, check out Chapter 3.

.ﻻ ﻧﹶﻨﺎﻡﹸ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺼﱠﻒﹼ ﺃﹶﺑﹶﺪﺍﹰ
(laa nanaamu fii-S-Saff ’abadan. We never sleep in class.)
Even though you don’t see the waaw at all with this verb, the only verb that can have 
a long a (written with ’alif) in the present tense of Form I is a medial waaw. So, look 
at that long a and always remember it’s secretly a waaw.
 
The particular style a medial waaw verb uses is predetermined. You can’t just select 
one or the other. A verb either follows the pattern of ( ﻗﺎﻝﹶqaala) or ( ﻧﺎﻡﹶnaama). A 
dictionary can tell you the style a verb follows.
The medial waaw in Form IV
A medial waaw causes no irregularity in Forms II and III. But Form IV is a different 
matter. In Form IV, the medial waaw vanishes altogether. Here are the guidelines to 
remember in this case:
 
 In the past tense, the waaw is replaced with a long a whenever the third conso-
nant has a vowel.
 
 Forms with a sukuun over the third consonant reduce the vowel to a fatHa.
 
 In the present tense, you encounter a long i vowel (written with yaa’), except for 
the feminine plural forms, which reduce it to a kasra.

 Chapter 10: Exploring Irregularity in Arabic Verbs 177
The verb ’( ﺃﹶﺟﺎﺏﹶajaaba; to answer) is a good example of how a Form IV medial waaw 
verb is formed. The following tables show the conjugations.

ﻟﹺﻤﺎﺫﺍ ﻻ ﺗﹸﺠﻴﺒﹸﻨﻲ؟
(limaadhaa laa tujiibunii? Why don’t you answer me?)
 
Take a mental note of the past and present tenses of ’( ﺃﹶﺟﺎﺏﹶajaaba) because they 
show you at a glance how medial waaw appears in the forms after Form I. Whenever 
you see long a and long i between two consonants, you have a medial waaw or medial 
yaa’ verb. But because medial yaa’ is relatively rare, it’s probably a medial waaw.
The medial waaw in Forms VII and VIII
Like Form IV, Forms VII and VIII are other cases of the completely vanished medial waaw. 
Like the second style for Form I, the waaw is replaced with a long a everywhere except:
 
 Past tense forms with sukuun over the third consonant
 
 The feminine plural forms in the present tense
The verb ( ﺍﹺﻧﹾﻘﺎﺩﹶinqaada; to obey) demonstrates how to make the Form VII of a medial 
waaw verb. The following tables show you the conjugations.

Here you see how the long a continues to be a reliable marker for a lost waaw.

medial waaw verb. See the tables for the conjugations.

When you see a verb in Form VIII, resist the urge to assume that the taa’ appearing 
after the first consonant is part of the root. Keep in mind that any long a vowel in the 
past or present tense is likely hiding a waaw instead.
The medial waaw in Form X
Medial waaw verbs in Form X follow the same rules as Form IV. Here are the rules:
 
 In the past tense, the waaw is replaced with a long a whenever the third conso-
nant has a vowel.
 
 Forms with a sukuun over the third consonant reduce the vowel to a fatHa.
 
 In the present tense, you encounter a long i vowel (written with yaa’), except for 
the feminine plural forms, which reduce it to a kasra.
The verb ( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻘﺎﻡﹶistaqaama; to stand up) is an example of a Form X verb. The follow-
ing are the conjugation tables for the verb.

(3indamaa nastaqiimu ma3an sanakuunu ’aqwiyaa’. When we stand up together we will be strong.)
Form X is another example of the need to never disregard the clue of having a long a 
or long i in the verb. I’ve seen many students try to make the ( ﺳﻴﻦsiin) or ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’) 
of Form X part of the root.
Verbs with medial yaa’
Verbs with a medial yaa’ are somewhat rare in the language. But there are a few of them 
that are common and important verbs. A medial yaa’ presents its own peculiar irregulari-
ties to your verb formation. A verb with medial yaa’ in Form I follows these guidelines:
 
 A long a vowel takes the place of the yaa’ in the past tense when the third conso-
nant has a vowel.
 
 The long a vowel in the past tense reduces to a kasra when the third consonant 
has a kasra.
 
 A long i vowel takes the place of the yaa’ in the present tense.
 
 The long i vowel in the present reduces to a kasra with the feminine plural forms.

The main thing to concentrate on in the previous charts is the vowel over the prefixes 
in the present tense. If you see a fatHa over the prefix, and then a long i where you 
may have expected a medial consonant, it means that you have a Form I medial yaa’ 
verb on your hands. If you see a Damma, you have a Form IV irregular verb.
In Forms IV, VII, VIII, and X, verbs with medial yaa’ behave exactly the same as Form 
IV, VII, VIII, and X medial waaw verbs.

Working with Final Weak Verbs
When the weak consonants ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) appear as the final consonant in 
an Arabic verb root, they create a series of irregularities in your verb production. I 
explain verbs with both consonants in the following sections. You may see verbs with 
a final waaw or yaa’ called defective verbs in other books. This really isn’t a good way 
to reference them, because they aren’t defective at all. Rather, the final weak conso-
nant just presents its own distinct patterns.
Verbs with final waaw
In Form I, verbs with a waaw as their third (and final) consonant follow these rules:
 
 Forms with (  ﹾsukuun) over the third consonant are normal, and the waaw 
appears as a full consonant.
 
 The waaw disappears in the past tense third person feminine singular.
 
 The waaw turns into a long a (written as an ’[ ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif]) in the past tense third 
person masculine singular.
 
 The past tense third person masculine plural is a consonantal waaw.
 
 All present tense forms without a suffix replace the waaw with a long u vowel.
 
 The waaw disappears in the present tense second person feminine singular.
As an example, the following tables show the conjugations of the Form I verb  ﺩﹶﻋﺎ
(da3aa; to call, invite).

(nad3uu kull ’aSdiqaa’anaa ’ilaa-l-Hafla. We invite all our friends to the party.)
Note that a final waaw verb is the only case in the whole Arabic language where the 
masculine and feminine plural forms are identical. Verbs with final waaw behave as if 
they have a final yaa’ in all the other Forms. To see what changes that means for you, 
consult the next section on final yaa’ verbs.
Verbs with final yaa’
 
Much more irregular than final waaw verbs (see the previous section) are those with 
a yaa’ as the third and final consonant. They’re more irregular than final waaw verbs 
in that there are three different styles that a final yaa’ verb can follow. And you don’t 
have your choice as to which of the three styles you prefer. Instead, if a verb has a 
final yaa’, you need to determine which of the three it is in order to correctly state it 
in the past and present in Form I.
The final yaa’ in Form I
I show you the verb ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry) as an example of the first style of a final yaa’ 
verb. The traits of this style of final yaa’ verb are a tendency for the yaa’ to be a con-
sonant in a closed syllable when suffixes are added to the past tense and for the yaa’ 
to appear as a long i vowel in the present tense. The following tables show the conju-
gations of ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry).

(hal tabkiina ’am taDHakiina? Are you crying or laughing?)
In the next style of final yaa’ verb, the yaa’ appears usually as a long i vowel in the 
past tense and as an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksura) in many present tense forms. For 
this style of verb, I use the verb ( ﻧﹶﺴﹺﻲﹶnasiya; to forget), whose conjugations you can 
see in the following tables.

’(ansaa al-’arqaam daa’iman. I always forget numbers.)
The third style of final yaa’ verb is essentially a hybrid of the previous two. It forms 
its past tense like ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry) and its present tense like ( ﻧﹶﺴﹺﻲﹶnasiya; to for
get). The following conjugation tables for ( ﺳﹶﻌﻰsa3aa; to make an effort) show you 
what I mean.

The final yaa’ in Forms II–X
Verbs with either final waaw or final yaa’ each have the same endings in Forms II–X. 
Essentially, the final waaw verbs act as if they were final yaa’. Forms II, III, IV, VIII, and 
X use the same endings as the Form I verb ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry). In the following conju-
gation tables, I show you the Form IV verb ’( ﺃﹶﺧﹾﻔﻰakhfaa; to hide) as an example.
Past conjugation for ’( ﺃﹶﺧﹾﻔﻰakhfaa; to hide)

Final weak verbs in Forms V, VI, and VII use the same endings with the exception of 
having an ’alif maksura in place of the final i in the present tense. For example, look 
at the conjugation tables for ( ﺗﹶﺴﹶﻤﹼﻰtasammaa; to be named).

Notice that the only difference between the masculine and feminine plural forms in 
the previous tables is the consonant before the final -na prefix — waaw for masculine 
and yaa’ for feminine.

Touching on Geminate Verbs
 
Sometimes a verb has the same consonant in the second and final position. Because 
you essentially have twin consonants in one verb, these are called geminate verbs 
(like my zodiac sign, Gemini). Some linguists call these doubled verbs, but this name 
isn’t helpful because there’s plenty of doubling that goes on in Arabic apart from the 
nature of the root (such as the doubling of the middle consonant in Form II).
With geminate verbs in Forms II, III, V, and VI, there’s no irregularity at all. In those 
forms, you can just use all three consonants normally, even though the second and 
third consonants are identical. In those forms, you have both consonants living side 
by side. But in Form I, a geminate verb will sometimes assimilate the two identical 
twins into one doubled consonant.
In Form I, there’s no irregularity when you put a suffix that begins in a consonant on the 
verb. But with other suffixes and in all present tense forms except the feminine plural, 
the second and third consonants contract into one doubled consonant. To show you 
how this appears, I include a conjugation table of the Form I verb ( ﻋﹶﺪﱠ3adda; to count).

The way to master the geminate verbs is to notice that the twin consonants double 
up whenever there’s a vowel after them. When there’s no vowel (such as when 
you have a consonant suffix), the twins insist on their individuality and both get 
pronounced.

Chapter 11
Using the Imperative in Commands
In This Chapter
 Using formal and informal commands in Arabic
 Producing imperative forms for regular verbs
 Understanding the forms of irregular Arabic imperatives
I
 bet in your average day you tell other people what to do hundreds of times. For 
example, if you’re a parent, you tell your kids to behave or to do their homework. 
Or, if you’re a student, you tell your roommates to pick up their clothes or to turn 
down their music. Now, I’m sure you’re appropriately polite about it. I mean, even if 
you’re a boss with lots of employees who answer to you, you’ve noticed that just 
barking orders doesn’t always get the desired result (unless, of course, you’re in the 
military!). You do better to at least add “please” to your request. And, chances are, 
when you tell someone what to do, you aren’t really so much telling them directly 
what to do as asking them in a roundabout way. You may say something like, “Would 
you please have this project done by close of business?” You may even ask that 
dreaded question, “Would you like to take out the trash?”
This chapter discusses the verb forms known as commands or imperatives. You first 
see how to work with verbs that have three strong consonants. Then later in the 
chapter, you uncover the changes to make when one of the three consonants is weak. 
Arabic also uses forms of the jussive mood to produce prohibitions (negative com-
mands, such as “Don’t stay out too late”) as well as hortatory commands (suggestions 
like “Let’s go out sometime”). You can explore the jussive forms and the ways you 
can use the jussive in Chapter 13.
As in English, Arabic has ways to form commands along the entire spectrum of direct-
ness and courtesy. In this chapter, you discover how to use and form a command for 
any verb and every occasion, whether you need to direct it to a close friend or a dig-
nitary you just met. So, please get ready. Would you like to begin?
Addressing People Properly with Commands
When you give any type of command, you’re addressing another person (unless 
you’re talking to a pet). You may be talking to one person, two friends, or 20 strang-
ers, but a command is something you direct to other people. So many other things in 
Arabic can be about inanimate objects or people who aren’t even in the room. But, 
generally speaking, a command is, by definition, an utterance directed at another 

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
194
human. (You can, of course, direct a command to your dogs. And they can even 
understand simple commands. But I’ll leave that for another book: Training Your Pets 
with Arabic Commands For Dummies! Or, maybe not.)
A command by definition is a request for action on the part of someone else. But you 
can’t really make anyone else do something. Just like in English, asking someone to 
do something in Arabic can run the spectrum of barking an order to asking for things 
as nicely as possible. Think of the difference, for instance, between these two sentences:
Finish your homework!
Would you be so good as to finish your homework, please?
The writer of both sentences has the same intention and hoped for outcome, but the 
tone of each is very different.
When to use the command form
 
As a general rule of thumb, Arabic courtesies for commands are the same as in 
English. In other words, don’t give a straight-out command to someone in Arabic if 
you wouldn’t command that person in English. At the very least, don’t forget to add a 
word for “please” if you direct a command at someone. If you’re in a setting like a taxi 
cab, restaurant, or hotel lobby, you can use command forms with employees, but 
omitting “please” is needlessly rude. Here are some examples of commands you 
might use in such settings:
.ﺍﹺﺣﹾﻤﹺﻞﹾ ﺣﹶﻘﻴﺒﹶﺘﻲ ﺇﹺﻟﻰ ﻏﹸﺮﹾﻓﹶﺘﻲ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹶ
(iHmil Haqiibatii ’ilaa ghurfatii, min faDlika. Carry my bag to my room, please.)
.ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹺ ﺃﹶﺧﹾﺒﹺﺮﻱ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﺒﹼﺎﺥﹶ ﺑﹺﺄﹶﻥﱠ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡﹶ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻣﹸﻤﺘﺎﺯﺍﹰ
(min faDliki ’akhbirii aT-Tabbaakha bi’anna aT-Ta3aama kaana mumtaazan. 
Please tell the cook that the food was wonderful.)
The preceding examples involve singular imperatives. You can generally use singular 
forms with a close friend or family member as well as with employees commonly 
understood to be in a servile position. Remember: You never have any reason to omit 
the courtesy of the word “please.”
When to use the polite alternatives 
to the command form
Just as in English, formal communication requires you to ask for things in a more 
round about way. When you write a business letter, you ordinarily stick to a level of 
courtesy beyond singular commands. The way Arabic kicks formality up a notch is to 
use the plural command. Just as the Queen of England can say of herself, “We are not 
amused,” using plural forms directed at a single person is seen as a polite way to ask 
for things. Here is an example of a plural command used for politeness:

(min faDlikum, as-sayyid mubaarak, ’a3dhiruuni 3an ghiyaabi 3an al-’ijtimaa3i 
’amsi. Please, Mr. Mubarak, forgive me for my absence from the meeting 
yesterday.)
Creating Commands of Regular Verbs
You write or speak commands with the intention of getting someone to do something. 
It makes sense that a language would use the simplest and most concise form of a 
verb to do that. Think about English for a moment. You change vowels and add suf-
fixes to the verb to tell depending on the tense. Someone tells a story. Yesterday he 
told a story. Right now she’s telling a story. But if you need to use the verb as a com-
mand, you use the most basic form available, and say “Tell me something.” Arabic is 
much the same. In this section, I show you how to strip the present tense of the verb 
down to its most basic form, the command.
Producing Form I regular verb commands
Form I verbs are the most common type in the Arabic language. (I cover the ten forms 
of the Arabic verb in Chapter 9.) I start with Form I verbs because they’re the most 
likely form you’ll face when writing and reading in Arabic. (You use a different final 
step to produce the commands for Forms II through X.) If you know how to form the 
present tense, forming the command won’t be difficult for you. If you’re rusty on the 
present tense, review it in Chapter 2.
 
A command is something you say to another person. And when you talk to another 
person, you use the second person present tense forms. Depending on whether 
you’re talking to one male, one female, or a mixed group of people, you use one of the 
four second person present tense forms of the verb. So there are four command 
forms, corresponding to the four second person present tense verbs. You shorten the 
second person present tense form of the verb to arrive at the command forms by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
1. Remove any suffix that follows a long vowel.
 
2. Shorten one more form, the second person masculine singular, by removing 
the final vowel, the (  ﹸDamma), and replacing it with the (  ﹾsukuun), which 
indicates that it has no vowel at all.
 
3. Add an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) after the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) of the masculine plural form.
 
 Arabic always adds an ’alif after the long u sound of a plural verb; it has no pro-
nunciation value.
 
4. Remove the present-tense prefix from all four second person present tense 
verb forms.
 
5. Identify the vowel after the second consonant of your verb and follow these 
instructions:

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
196
 
• If the vowel is an a (written with [   ﹶfatHa]), add a short i vowel (written 
with an ’alif and a [   ﹺkasra]) at the beginning of the word.
 
• If the vowel is an i (written with kasra), add a short i vowel (written with an 
’alif and a kasra) at the beginning of the word.
 
• If the vowel is a u (written with a Damma), add a short u vowel at the begin-
ning of the word (written with an ’alif and a Damma).
When you follow these five steps for the Form I verb ( ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺐﹶdhahaba; to go), you pro-
duce the commands in Table 11-1.

’( ﺗﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺒﻮﻥﹶantum tadh-habuuna; You go)( ﺍﹺﺫﹾﻫﹶﺒﻮﺍidh-habuu; Go!)
’( ﺗﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺒﹾﻦﹶantunna tadh-habna; You go)( ﺍﹺﺫﹾﻫﹶﺒﹾﻦﹶidh-habna; Go!)
The verb ( ﺩﹶﺧﹶﻞﹶdakhala; to enter) has a (  ﹸDamma) after the second consonant in the 
present tense. Follow the five steps from earlier in the chapter to produce the com-
mand forms, which you can see in Table 11-2.

Imperative of ( ﺩﹶﺧﹶﻞﹶdakhala; to enter), a Form I Verb

’( ﺗﹶﺪﹾﺧﹸﻠﻮﻥﹶantum tadkhuluuna; You enter)( ﺍﹸﺩﹾﺧﹸﻠﻮﺍudkhuluu; Enter!)
’( ﺗﹶﺪﹾﺧﹸﻠﹾﻦﹶantunna tadkhulna; You enter)( ﺍﹸﺩﹾﺧﹸﻠﹾﻦﹶudkhulna; Enter!)
Here are examples of a few sentences showing the command forms in action:
.ﺍﹺﻗﹾﺮﹶﺃﹾ ﺍﻟﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏﹶ
(iqra’ al-kitaaba. Read the book.)
.ﺍﹸﻛﹾﺘﹸﺒﹾﻦﹶ ﺃﹶﺳﹾﻤﺎﺀﹶﻛﹸﻦﱠ
(uktubna asmaa’akunna. Write your names.)
 
This exercise lets you apply the five steps of command production that I explain ear-
lier. For each item, I give you a second person present tense verb for Form I. Your job 
is to turn each one into the command form that matches the gender and number of 
the present tense verb you start with.

Producing regular verb commands 
for Forms II, III, V, and VI
To produce the commands of Forms II, III, V, and VI, you use some of the same steps 
you use to produce commands of Form I verbs (see the previous section). The differ-
ence is that you can stop after Step 4 with these verbs because the first consonant 
has a vowel. The fifth step is necessary only when Steps 2 through 4 leave an initial 
consonant without a vowel.
 
Here are the steps you take to produce commands for Forms II, III, V, and VI:
 
1. Starting from the end of the verb, remove any suffix that follows a long vowel.
 
2. Shorten up one more form, the second person masculine singular, by remov-
ing the final vowel, the (  ﹸDamma), and replacing it with the (  ﹾsukuun), which 
indicates that it now has no vowel at all.
 
3. Add an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) after the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) of the masculine plural form.
 
 Arabic always adds an ’alif after the long u sound of a plural verb; it has no pro-
nunciation value.
 
4. Remove the present-tense prefix from all four second person present tense 
verb forms.

Producing regular verb commands 
for Forms IV, VII, VIII, IX, and X
 
Removing the present tense prefixes from Forms IV, VII, VIII, IX, and X leaves behind a 
consonant without a vowel. But Arabic doesn’t accept consonants without vowels at 
the beginnings of words. To solve the problem, you need another step to complete 
your command production. So to create the commands for these verbs, you have to 
follow the first four steps from the earlier section, “Producing Form I regular verb 
commands,” and then add the new Step 5. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Starting from the end of the verb, remove any suffix that follows a long vowel.
 
2. Shorten up one more form, the second person masculine singular, by remov
 
 ing the final vowel, the (  ﹸDamma), and replacing it with the (  ﹾsukuun), which 
indicates that it now has no vowel at all.
 
3. Add an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) after the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) of the masculine plural form.
 
 Arabic always adds an ’alif after the long u sound of a plural verb; it has no pro-
nunciation value.
 
4. Remove the present-tense prefix from all four second person present tense 
verb forms.
 
5. Add the past-tense prefix specific to each form.
I give you an example for four of the forms in this section; see Tables 11-7, 11-8, 11-9, 
and 11-10.

Making Commands with Weak Verbs
Verb forms in Arabic are quite regular whenever you have three strong consonants 
in the root. However, whenever one of the so-called “weak” letters appears, the verb 
can become irregular. Commands are no different. If you aren’t familiar with the ways 
weak letters change the verb, you can review the topic in Chapter 10.
Commanding with the initial ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) 
and initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw)
When you have an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) or a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) as the first consonant, it simply drops off 
when you create a command for Form I verbs. Tables 11-11 and 11-12 show some 
examples.
Table 11-11 
Imperative of ’( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻞﹶakala; to eat), a Form I Verb
Present Tense

’( ﺗﹶﻀﹶﻌﹾﻦﹶantunna taDa3na; You put)( ﺿﹶﻌﹾﻦﹶDa3na; Put!)
In other verb forms, commands from initial ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) and initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) verbs are 
no more irregular than the present tense from which you form them. Here are a few 
examples of commands from initial ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) and initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) verbs. The third 
example shows you how an initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) Form VIII verb is regular in its production:
.ﺿﹶﻊﹾ ﺣﹶﻘﻴﺒﹶﺘﻲ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺰﺍﻭﻳﺔﹺ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹶ
(Da3 Haqiibatii fi-l-zaawiyati, min faDlika. Put my bag in the corner, please.)
.ﻛﹸﻠﻮﺍ ﻳﺎ ﺃﹶﻭﹾﻻﺩ
(kuluu yaa ’awlaad. Eat up, children.)
.ﺍﹺﺗﱠﺠﹺﻪﹾ ﺇﹶﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﺴﺎﺭﹺ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻔﹾﺘﹶﺮﻕﹺ
(ittajih ’ilaa-l-yasaari 3inda-l-muftaraqi. Head to the left at the corner.)
Commanding with medial weak verbs
 
A medial weak verb is a verb with a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or a ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) as its second consonant. 
To produce the command of a medial weak verb, you follow the same first four steps 
as demonstrated in other sections of this chapter. But then you have a unique fifth 
step in which you reduce the long middle vowel for the masculine singular and femi-
nine plural forms. The feminine singular and masculine plural commands are finished 
with just the first four steps.
If the medial vowel is written with ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), replace it with (  ﹸDamma). Table 11-13 
shows the commands of a common verb of this type.
Table 11-13 Imperative of ( ﻗﺎﻝﹶqaala; to say), a Form I Medial Weak Verb
Present Tense
Imperative
’( ﺗﹶﻘﻮﻝﹸanta taquulu; You say)( ﻗﹸﻞﹾqul; Say!)
’( ﺗﹶﻘﻮﻟﻴﻦﹶanti taquuliina; You say)( ﻗﻮﻟﻲquulii; Say!)
’( ﺗﹶﻘﻮﻟﻮﻥﹶantum taquuluuna; You say)( ﻗﻮﻟﻮﺍquuluu; Say!)
’( ﺗﹶﻘﹸﻠﹾﻦﹶantunna taqulna; You say)( ﻗﹸﻠﹾﻦﹶqulna; Say!)

 Chapter 11: Using the Imperative in Commands 203
If the medial vowel is written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), replace it with (  ﹺkasra). Table 11-14 
shows examples of commands for a verb with a medial ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’).
Table 11-14 Imperative of ( ﺑﺎﻉﹶbaa3a; to sell), a Form I Medial Weak Verb
Present Tense
Imperative
’( ﺗﹶﺒﻴﻊﹸanta tabii3u; You sell)( ﺑﹺﻊﹾbi3; Sell!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﻴﻌﻴﻦﹶanti tabii3iina; You sell)( ﺑﻴﻌﻲbii3ii; Sell!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﻴﻌﻮﻥﹶantum tabii3uuna; You sell)( ﺑﻴﻌﻮﺍbii3uu; Sell!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﹺﻌﹾﻦﹶantunna tabi3na; You sell)( ﺑﹺﻌﹾﻦﹶbi3na; Sell!)
If the medial vowel is written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif), put (  ﹶfatHa) in its place for the mascu-
line singular and feminine plural command forms. Table 11-15 shows commands for 
this type of verb.
Table 11-15 
Imperative of ( ﺧﺎﻑﹶkhaafa; to be afraid), 
 
a Form I Medial Weak Verb
Present Tense
Imperative
’( ﺗﹶﺨﺎﻑﹸanta takhaafu; You are afraid)( ﺧﹶﻒﹾkhaf; Be afraid!)
’( ﺗﹶﺨﺎﻓﻴﻦﹶanti takhaafiina; You are afraid)( ﺧﺎﻓﻲkhaafii; Be afraid!)
’( ﺗﹶﺨﺎﻓﻮﻥﹶantum takhaafuuna; You are afraid)( ﺧﺎﻓﻮﺍkhaafuu; Be afraid!)
’( ﺗﹶﺨﹶﻔﹾﻦﹶantunna takhafna; You are afraid)( ﺧﹶﻔﹾﻦﹶkhafna; Be afraid!)
The same reductions in vowel length that take place in Form I also occur in Forms II–X. 
Table 11-16 shows an example of a Form IV verb command from a medial weak verb.

Commanding with the final 
( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) and ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’)
 
Verbs with a final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) form their command forms with the 
same first four steps as every other verb with only one exception: The final long 
vowel of the masculine singular reduces to a short vowel.
If the final vowel is written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’), it reduces to (   ﹺkasra). Table 11-17 shows 
commands for this type of verb.
Table 11-17 Imperative of ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry), a Form I Final Weak Verb
Present Tense
Imperative
’( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻲanta tabkii; You cry)( ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻚﹺibki; Cry!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻴﻦﹶanti tabkiina; You cry)( ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻜﻲibkii; Cry!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻮﻥﹶantum tabkuuna; You cry)( ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻜﻮﺍibkuu; Cry!)
’( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻴﻦﹶantunna tabkiina; You cry)( ﺍﹺﺑﹾﻜﻴﻦﹶibkiina; Cry!)
If the final vowel is written with ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw), it reduces to (  ﹸDamma). Table 11-18 
gives you the commands for this type of verb.
Table 11-18 Imperative of ( ﺩﹶﻋﺎda3aa; to call), a Form I Final Weak Verb
Present Tense
Imperative
’( ﺗﹶﺪﹾﻋﻮanta tad3uu; You call)( ﺍﹸﺩﹾﻉﹸud3u; Call!)
’( ﺗﹶﺪﹾﻋﻴﻦﹶanti tad3iina; You call)( ﺍﹸﺩﹾﻋﻲud3ii; Call!)

’( ﺗﹶﺪﹾﻋﻮﻥﹶantunna tad3uuna; You call)( ﺍﹸﺩﹾﻋﻮﻥﹶud3uuna; Call!)
If the final vowel is written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura), it reduces to   ﹶ
(fatHa). In Table 11-19, I show you the commands of a verb of this type.

Answer Key

Chapter 12
Writing to the Point with Object 
Suffixes and Pronouns
In This Chapter
 Changing nouns with possessive suffixes
 Forming object suffixes on verbs
 Adding suffixes to prepositions
“H
ow can you correct this sentence to make this sentence more concise?” 
That’s easy! Just don’t repeat the words “this sentence!” After you’ve 
referred to something once, you can usually replace it with a pronoun in the second 
reference. For example, you may write something like this: “How can you correct this 
sentence to make it more concise?”
You use pronouns so often in your speaking and writing that you probably don’t even 
think about them. Like so many things in a language, the most common things can fre-
quently be the most irregular. For instance, consider the fact that English preserves 
different forms of pronouns depending on whether the pronoun is a subject or an 
object. And so, you write “He celebrates his birthday with me,” but then “I saw him at 
the party.”
 
Like English, Arabic also has different forms of pronouns depending on whether the 
pronoun is the subject or the object of the verb. In Arabic, however, only the subject 
pronouns will be separate words. Every other type of pronoun will be a suffix on a 
verb or preposition. In this chapter, you discover everything you need to tighten your 
writing by effortlessly adding object pronouns to verbs and prepositions.
Forms of the Object Suffix
Object suffixes that are added to a verb are almost identical to the possessive pro-
noun suffixes. If you’re rusty on the possessive pronoun suffixes, you may want to 
study them before working through this chapter. I discuss them in Chapter 2.
I show you the minor difference between object suffixes and possessive pronoun suf-
fixes before letting you see all the forms together. Then I show you just a few minor 
tweaks to the system that you’ll encounter before you can declare yourself an expert 
on the object suffixes.

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
208
Note: Because the focus of this chapter is the object suffixes, I will not use all of the 
formal final endings on the nouns and verbs.
Using nii instead of ii
 
The object suffixes themselves depart from the possessive pronoun suffixes in only 
one place: the first person singular. When you put the possessive pronoun for my on 
a noun in Arabic, the ending is ( ﻱii). But when you want to describe in Arabic how 
someone saw me, the ending you put on the verb is ( ﻧﻲnii). Here’s an example of this 
 
suffix in use. I underline the ending so you can locate it easily:
.ﺃﹶﺧﹾﺒﹶﺮﹶﻧﻲ ﻋﹶﻦ ﺍﻟﺒﹺﻨﺎﻳﺔ ﺍﹶﻟﱠﺘﻲ ﻳﹶﻌﹾﻤﹶﻞﹸ ﻓﻴﻬﺎ
’(akhbarani 3an al-binaaya allatii ya3amlu fiihaa. He told me about the building 
in which he works.)
Table 12-1 shows a run-through of the object suffixes using the third person past 
tense verb, ( ﺯﺍﺭﹶzaara; he visited), as an example.
Table 12-1 
Object Suffixes
English Object Pronoun
Object Suffix
Example
me( ﻧﻲ-nii)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻧﻲzaaranii; he visited me)
you (MS)( ﻙﹶ-ka)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻙﹶzaaraka; he visited you)
you (FS)( ﻙﹺ-ki)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻙﹺzaaraki; he visited you)
him( ﻩﹸ-hu)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻩﹸzaarahu; he visited him)
her( ﻫﺎ-haa)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻫﺎzaarahaa; he visited her)
us( ﻧﺎ-naa)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻧﺎzaaranaa; he visited us)
you (MP)( ﻛﹸﻢ-kum)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻛﹸﻢzaarakum; he visited you)
you (FP)( ﻛﹸﻦﱠ-kunna)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻛﹸﻦﱠzaarakunna; he visited you)
them (MP)( ﻫﹸﻢ-hum)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻫﹸﻢzaarahum; he visited them)
them (FP)( ﻫﹸﻦﱠ-hunna)( ﺯﺍﺭﹶﻫﹸﻦﱠzaarahunna; he visited them)
Replacing the (  ﹸDamma) with a (  ﹺkasra)
 
You need to make one minor adjustment in the vowel of a few of the object suffixes. 
Arabic doesn’t like having a u vowel (written with the [   ﹸDamma]) after the i vowel, 
or (   ﹺkasra). So it changes the u to another i. (Linguists call this euphony, meaning, it 
 
sounds nicer.) So where you might have expected ( ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺘﹺﻪﹸra’aytihu; you saw him), you 
 
instead get ( ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺘﹺﻪﹺra’aytihi). Three conditions cause this euphonic change to happen. 
You will see it after:

 Chapter 12: Writing to the Point with Object Suffixes and Pronouns 209
 
 a short i (written with [  ﹺkasra])
 
 a long i (written with [ ﻳﺎﺀyaa’])
 
 a closed syllable ending in y (written with a [ ﻳﺎﺀyaa’] and a [  ﹾsukuun])
Here are two examples:
ﻫﹶﻞ ﺗﹶﺮﹶﻛﹾﺘﹺﻬﹺﻢ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓ؟
(hal taraktihim fii-s-sayyara? Did you leave them in the car?)
ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺘﹺﻪﹺ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ ﺃﹶﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻛﹶﺬﻟﹺﻚﹶ ؟
(ra’aytihi hunaka, ’alaysa kadhaalika? You saw him there, isn’t that so?)
Looking at the disappearing ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif)
The change I explain in this section is only a matter of spelling. You ordinarily write 
an extra ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) after the third person masculine plural in the past tense:
.’( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﻮﺍ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡﹶakaluu aT-Ta3aama. They ate the food.)
When you add an object suffix, however, you just remove that extra ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) and 
add your object suffix:
.’( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﻮﻩﹸakaluuhu. They ate it.)
Here are a few more examples:
.ﻛﹶﺘﹶﺒﻮﺍ ﺭﹶﺳﺎﺋﹺﻠﹶﻬﹸﻢ ﺛﹸﻢﱠ ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺳﹶﻠﻮﻫﺎ ﻷﹶﺻﹾﺪﹺﻗﺎﺋﹺﻬﹺﻢ
(katabuu rasaa’ilahum thumma ’arsaluuhaa li-’aSdiqaaiihim. They wrote their 
letters and then sent them to their friends.)
.ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﺟﹶﺪﻳﺪ ﻟﻜﹺﻦ ﺑﺎﻋﻮﻩﹸ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﻛﹸﻞﱢ ﺣﺎﻝ
(al-bayt jadiid, laakin baa3uuhu 3alaa kulli Haal. The house is new, but they sold 
it anyway.)
Changing tum to tumuu
The change I explain in this section is a little more involved than the magical disap-
pearing ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) trick. When you write the second person masculine plural ending, 
you use the ending tum. Here’s an example:
.’( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﹾﺘﹸﻢ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡﹶakaltum aT-Ta3aama. You ate the food.)
When you add an object suffix to a verb with the second person masculine plural end-
ing, however, you change the verb ending to tumuu, as in this example:
.’( ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻠﹾﺘﹸﻤﻮﻩﹸakaltumuuhu. You ate it.)

Here are two more examples to demonstrate the different ending:
ﺃﹶﺭﹾﺳﹶﻠﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﺮﹾﺩ ﻣﹸﻨﹾﺬﹸ ﺃﹸﺳﹾﺒﻮﻉ. ﺃﹶﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺘﹸﻤﻮﻩﹸ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪ؟
’(arsaltu aT-Tard mundhu usbuu3. ’ara’aytumuuhu ba3d? I sent the package a 
week ago. Have you seen it yet?)
ﺃﹶﻋﹾﺠﹶﺒﹶﺘﹾﻨﻲ ﺗﹺﻠﹾﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻘﺎﻟﺔ. ﻫﹶﻞ ﻗﹶﺮﹶﺃﹾﺗﹸﻤﻮﻫﺎ ﺃﹶﻳﹾﻀﺎﹰ؟
’(a3jabatni tilka-l-maqaala. hal qara’tumuuhaa ’ayDaN? I loved that article. Have 
you also read it?)
 
Now it’s your turn to have fun with object suffixes. In the following exercise, I give 
you a verb and a pronoun. Take the verb and add to it the object suffix that corre-
sponds to the pronoun next to it.

Important verbs using object suffixes
After you’re comfortable with putting the object suffixes on verbs, you’re ready to use 
some important Arabic idiomatic verbs that require object suffixes. I show you two of 
the most common and useful verbs in this category. The proper use of these verbs 
will distinguish your Arabic use.
The Arabic verb ’( ﺃﹶﻋﹾﺠﹶﺐﹶa3jaba; to please) functions exactly the same as Spanish 
gustar. The thing liked will actually be the subject of the verb and the thing that likes 
it will be the direct object, expressed as an object suffix. In your basic Arabic studies, 
you may have learned to say you like something using ’( ﺃﹸﺣﹺﺐﱡuHibbu; I like/love). 
This usage isn’t wrong, but it isn’t as formal and proper as ’( ﺃﹶﻋﹾﺠﹶﺐﹶa3jaba). (This 
verb is a Form IV verb, which you can review in Chapter 9.) Here are two examples 
that use this verb:
.ﻳﹸﻌﹾﺠﹺﺒﹸﻨﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﹾﻌﹶﻢ
(yu3jibunii al-maT3am. I like the restaurant. [literally, The restaurant pleases me.])
.ﺃﹶﻋﹾﺠﹶﺒﹶﺘﹾﻨﺎ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓ
’(a3jabatnaa as-sayyaara. We liked the car. [literally, The car pleased us.])
Another important idiomatic verb to include in your Arabic vocabulary is  ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶ
(waSala; to arrive). This verb is a Form I verb but it’s irregular because it has a  ﻭﺍﻭ
(waaw) as the first consonant of its root (you can refresh your memory on irregular 
verbs in Chapter 10). An idiomatic usage of ( ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶwaSala) requires you to use object 
suffixes. When you get something in the mail, the preferable idiom in Arabic is to say, 
The letter arrived [to] me. Here’s the Arabic equivalent:
.ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻠﹶﺘﹾﻨﻲ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺳﺎﻟﺔ
(waSalatnii ar-risaala. I received the letter.)
 
Whenever a language behaves differently than our native language, it’s difficult to 
break out of our normal mode of thinking. Resist the natural temptation to make your-
self the grammatical subject when you remark that you like something or got some-
thing in the mail. Instead, think backwards from how English works. For example, 
avoid thinking I like or I receive. Instead, write pleases me and arrived me. If you use 
the verbs in this section correctly, these idioms will distinguish you as having a good 
command of Modern Standard Arabic.

Your Arabic teacher knows how important it is for you to master the idioms covered 
in this section. So, she’s giving you a pop quiz in which you have to form several sen-
tences with each verb. For each question, you get a noun, a verb, and a pronoun. The 
noun is the grammatical subject and the pronoun is the object. Create the indicated 
Arabic sentence for both the past and present tenses.

Connecting Prepositions  
with Object Pronouns
You use pronouns with prepositions because you can write more concisely with 
them. The rule we follow in English is to use the same form of the pronoun after prep-
ositions as we would use for direct objects. For example, you may say, I met my friend 
in the park and went with him to dinner.
 
While English uses object pronouns after prepositions, Arabic puts the possessive 
pronouns on prepositions as a suffix.
In this section, you explore the two types of prepositions in Arabic and see how the 
possessive pronoun suffixes team up with them.
Indeclinable prepositions
The type of preposition that’s most common and easiest to learn in Arabic is called 
the indeclinable preposition. Characteristics of indeclinable prepositions include at 
least one of the following:
 
 They’re spelled with only one or two letters.
 
 They end in a long vowel.
Besides taking possessive pronoun suffixes, indeclinable prepositions can be used 
with nouns. I introduce you to a couple of indeclinable prepositions, underlining them 
for you to help you spot them:
.ﺧﹶﺮﹶﺟﹾﺖﹸ ﻣﹺﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﻭﹶﻣﹶﺸﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﹶﺪﻳﻘﺔ
(kharajtu mina-l-bayt wa-mashaytu ’ilaa al-Hadiiqa. I went out from the house 
and walked to the park.)
.ﺭﹶﺃﹶﺕﹾ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﹶﺘﹶﻬﺎ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻴﹼﺎﺭﺓ
(ra’at Sadiiqatahaa fii-s-sayyaara. She saw her friend in the car.)

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
214
 
The possessive suffixes are added to the prepositions with just a few irregularities. 
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:
 
 Before the suffix ( ﻱii; me, my), indeclinable prepositions ending in ( ﻥnuun) 
 
 double that nun. For example, ( ﻣﹺﻦmin; from) becomes ( ﻣﹺﻨﹼﻲminni; from me).
 
 Instead of ( ﻱii; me, my), you add ( ﻱﹶ-ya; me, my) to prepositions ending in a long 
 
 vowel. You write the ( ﻱﹶ-ya) with a (  ﹼshadda) whenever the final vowel is a long 
i (written with [ ﻳﺎﺀyaa’]). Here are two examples: ( ﻓﻲﱠfiiyya; in me) and  ﺇﻟﹶﻲﱠ
 
’( ilayya; to me).
Table 12-2 shows the suffixes of the indeclinable preposition ( ﺑﹺbi-; with). Note that 
the vowel of the forms ( ﻩﹸhu) and ( ﻫﹸﻢhum) changes to i to match the vowel of the 
preposition.
Table 12-2 
Indeclinable Prepositions
Suffix
Preposition + Suffix
( ﻱ-ii)( ﺑﻲbii; with me)
( ﻙﹶ-ka)( ﺑﹺﻚﹶbika; with you)
( ﻙﹺ-ki)( ﺑﹺﻚﹺbiki; with you)
( ﻩﹸ-hu) / ( ﻩﹺ-hi)( ﺑﹺﻪﹺbihi; with him)
( ﻫﺎ-haa)( ﺑﹺﻬﺎbihaa; with her)
( ﻧﺎ-naa)( ﺑﹺﻨﺎbinaa; with us)
( ﻛﹸﻢ-kum)( ﺑﹺﻜﹸﻢbikum; with you)
( ﻫﹸﻢ-hum) / ( ﻫﹺﻢ-him)( ﺑﹺﻬﹺﻢbihim; with them)
Here are some other indeclinable prepositions:
 
 ( ﺳﹺﻮﻯsiwaa; other than)
 
 ( ﻛﹶka-; like)
 
 ( ﻋﹶﻦ3an; about)
 
 ( ﺣﹶﺘﹼﻰHatta; until)
 
 ( ﻣﹶﻊﹶma3a; with)
 
 ’( ﺇﻟﻰilaa; to)
A final ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura) is hiding a final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) that existed in the 
distant past. When you put any type of suffix on a word with final ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif 
maksuura), the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) reappears. (This is similar to how you pronounce the usu-
ally silent final s in French words when a vowel immediately follows.)

 Chapter 12: Writing to the Point with Object Suffixes and Pronouns 215
Understanding suffixes on prepositions with a final 
’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura)
 
When a preposition ends in ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura), the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) becomes 
a final consonant, onto which you then put your possessive pronoun suffixes. 
Table 12-3 shows an example of when this happens with the preposition ( ﻋﹶﻠﻰ3alaa; 
 
on/onto). Note the use of the suffix ( ﻱﹶya) in place of ( ﻱii), as well as ( ﻩﹺhi) for ( ﻩﹸhu) 
and ( ﻫﹺﻢhim) for ( ﻫﹸﻢhum) in response to the final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’).

( ﻙﹺ-ki)( ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﻚﹺ3alayki; on you)
( ﻩﹸ-hu) / ( ﻩﹺ-hi)( ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﻪﹺ3alayhi; on him)
( ﻫﺎ-haa)( ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﻬﺎ3alayhaa; on her)
( ﻧﺎ-naa)( ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﻨﺎ3alaynaa; on us)

( ﻫﹸﻢ-hum) / ( ﻫﹺﻢ-him)( ﻋﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﻬﹺﻢ3alayhim; on them)
Dealing with the preposition ( ﻝﹺli-; to)
The preposition ( ﻝﹺli-; to) picks up the vowel (  ﹶfatHa) when you add suffixes that 
begin in consonants. Table 12-4 shows what the preposition looks like after you add 
the (  ﹶfatHa).

Declinable prepositions
Think for a moment about the English preposition beside. You may have noticed that 
this preposition is related to the noun side. The English language also has inside and 
outside. These prepositions began their careers as nouns. Similarly, Arabic has sev-
eral nouns that function as quasi-prepositions. They’re called declinable prepositions. 
They’re called this because they “decline,” that is to say they take the genitive case 
just like nouns if you put another preposition in front of them. (You can encounter 
the genitive case in more detail in Chapter 4.)
Here are two examples of the declinable preposition ( ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺏﹶqurba; near) used by itself:
.ﻭﹶﺟﹶﺪﻭﻩﹸ ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺏﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(wajaduuhu qurba-l-bayti. They found him near the house.)
.ﻻﺣﹶﻈﹶﺘﹾﻪﹸ ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺑﹶﻪﹸ
(laaHaDHathu qurbahu. She noticed him near it.)
 
The thing that makes the declinable prepositions different from the indeclinable 
types is that they can take prepositions themselves. Like all words following preposi-
tions, the declinable prepositions take on the final i vowel of the genitive case.
In the following two examples, I put the preposition bi- on the declinable preposition  ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺏﹶ
(qurba). Notice that the meaning doesn’t change at all. The only thing that changes about 
the declinable preposition itself is that the final vowel changes from a to i because it takes 
on the genitive case after the prepositional prefix.
.ﻭﹶﺟﹶﺪﻭﻩﹸ ﺑﹺﻘﹸﺮﹾﺏﹺ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(wajaduuhu bi-qurbi-l-bayt. They found him near the house.)
.ﻻﺣﹶﻈﹶﺘﹾﻪﹸ ﺑﹺﻘﹸﺮﹾﺑﹺﻪﹺ
(laaHaDHathu bi-qurbihi. She noticed him near it.)
Here are some other declinable prepositions. Notice that one feature of the declinable 
prepositions is that all of them end in a when they stand by themselves:
 
 ( ﻣﹺﺜﹾﻞﹶmithla; like)
 
 ( ﺑﹶﻴﹾﻦﹶbayna; between)
 
 ( ﻗﹸﺮﹾﺏﹶqurba; near)
 
 ’( ﺃﹶﻣﺎﻡﹶamaama; in front of)
 
 ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶba3da; after)
 
 ( ﻗﹶﺒﹾﻞﹶqabla; before)
 
 ( ﻭﹶﺭﺍﺀﹶwaraa’a; behind)
 
 ( ﺧﹺﻼﻝﹶkhilaala; during)
 
 ( ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶ3inda; at)
 
 ( ﺩﻭﻥﹶduuna; without)

In this exercise, you’re writing an e-mail to your friend Ahmad that requires you to 
use several prepositions with object pronouns. The context of each sentence tells 
you which preposition in your word bank is the best choice as well as what object 
pronoun to add. To determine what the best preposition is, you may have to consult 
your dictionary to see what prepositions are used with the verbs in this e-mail. You 
have a variety of declinable and indeclinable prepositions to choose from, but each 
one makes the best sense in only one spot.

Hello, my friend Ahmad
I have to buy a new notebook tomorrow.  Maybe you want to go with me.
As for me, I don’t want to go without you.
But you don’t know my new address.  And you need it if you want to find my house.
Send me the phone number, and I will call you.
I heard about your problem, and I was thinking it over.
I want to learn all the details from you so we can find a solution about the issue before you.
As for your wife, greet her for me.
See you later,

ave you ever heard someone say something like, “I wish I was in Cairo right 
now!” Or maybe, “If only I can see the pyramids!” You understand what they 
mean, but you also sense that something’s a bit off in their sentences. Better word 
choices would have been, “I wish I were . . .” and “If only I could . . .” Words like should, 
would, could, and were in English are the last vestiges we have left of something called 
mood in language. That’s right; your professor isn’t the only one who can be moody.
Modern Standard Arabic has three moods: indicative, subjunctive, and jussive. In 
Arabic, mood refers to whether the action of the verb has happened or is just some-
thing you want to happen. There’s only one mood for the past tense verb: the indica-
tive. The logic behind this is that anything reported as having happened must, by 
definition, be indicative, because indicative is the mood for reporting realities.
A verb, as you see in this chapter, doesn’t really change its meaning when used in 
these moods. Instead, the various moods simply give you the correct expression of 
the verb for the different situations you face. In this chapter, you discover how to cre-
ate the three moods easily, and you figure out when and how to use them.
Setting the Record Straight 
with the Indicative Mood
 
In your everyday use of any language, you tend to talk about realities. You tell your 
friends what you did over the weekend. You tell your significant other that you love 
him or her. When you use language this way, you’re using the indicative mood, which 
means that the action of the verb

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
222
 
 Has actually taken place
 
 Is currently taking place
 
 Will indeed take place
The past tense you encountered in your basic studies is indicative because the action 
is over. The action definitely happened, and you’re using the past tense to describe it.
Take special note that a ( ﹸDamma) appears over four of the present indicative forms: 
the first person singular and plural, the second person singular masculine, and the 
third person singular masculine. The verbs ending in ( ﹸDamma) can be converted 
into the other two moods by changing only the ( ﹸDamma). (You can read more about 
the [  ﹸDamma] in Chapter 3.)
The following table shows you the present indicative of the Form I verb  ﺷﹶﻜﹶﺮﹶ
(shakara; to thank).

Hypothesizing with the Subjunctive Mood
The subjunctive mood is used to convey the idea of being subjective or hypothetical. 
You need the subjunctive, for instance, when you wish something would happen. 
Here are a few examples in English of the subjunctive in action:
I wish he would tell me what happened.
If only I could go along with them.
It’s important that he travel tomorrow.
 
Notice that in the third example, the subjunctive in English is different from the indic-
ative he travels. The subjunctive doesn’t impart a new meaning to the verb. Rather, 
it’s just the correct version of the verb for certain situations. If you make a mistake 
and use the indicative instead of the subjunctive in English, people will understand 
you. In fact, many folks may not even notice the error. The same thing is true of 

 Chapter 13: The Indicative, Jussive, and Subjunctive Moods of the Arabic Verb 223
Arabic. But because I know that you want to stand out from the crowd, I show you 
how to create the subjunctive in Arabic and when to use it.
Forming the subjunctive of regular verbs
 
The subjunctive involves changing the suffixes of a verb. No matter which one of the 
ten verb forms you have, the suffixes are all the same. For that reason, forming the 
subjunctive is the same for all ten verb forms. To produce the subjunctive of regular 
verbs, you have to do the following:
 
 Change any final (  ﹸDamma) to (  ﹶfatHa).
 
 Remove the suffix ( ﻥﹶna) or ( ﻥﹺni) after any long vowel, and add a superfluous ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) after any resulting final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw).
 
 Leave the final ( ﻥﹶna) of the feminine plural verbs alone. These verbs are the 
same in all three moods.
The following table shows you what you get after applying the previous guidelines to 
the verb ( ﺷﹶﻜﹶﺮﹶshakara; to thank).
( ﺷﹶﻜﹶﺮﹶshakara; to thank)
’( ﺃﹶﺷﹾﻜﹸﺮﹶanaa ’ashkura)( ﻧﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﹶnaHnu nashkura)

(yajibu ’an ’ashkura mudarrisii limusaa3adatihi. 
It is necessary that I thank my teacher for his help.)
Forming the subjunctive of irregular verbs
The subjunctive mood is only irregular with verbs that have a weak final letter (for 
more on irregular verbs see Chapter 10). Even then, only a few verbs require an 
adjustment to the normal rules that you use to produce the subjunctive.
It’s easier to show you the indicative and subjunctive of final weak verbs side by side 
and point out how the final weak letter altered the verb. Table 13-1 shows the present 
indicative and subjunctive versions of the Form I final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) verb ( ﺩﹶﻋﺎda3aa; 
to call).

( ﻳﹶﺪﹾﻋﻮﺍhum yad3uu; [that] they call)( ﻳﹶﺪﹾﻋﻮﻥﹶhum yad3uuna; they call)
 
When you remove the endings after long vowels, the subjunctive verbs with final  ﻭﺍﻭ
(waaw) are completely regular. The only tricky verbs are those that have a final long 
u vowel — written with a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw). To produce these subjunctive verbs you:
 
 Turn the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) into a consonant and add the (  ﹶfatHa) of the subjunctive.
 
 Put a (  ﹸDamma) over the middle consonant of the root.
Verbs with a final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) are irregular in one of two ways. First off, if the verb has 
an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura) as the final vowel in the present indicative, the sub-
junctive won’t change at all. Table 13-2 shows the subjunctive and present indicative 
of the Form I final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verb ( ﻧﹶﺴﹺﻲﹶnasiya; to forget).
Table 13-2 
Comparing the Subjunctive and Present Indicative of  ﻧﹶﺴﹺﻲﹶ
 
(nasiya; to forget), a Final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) Verb
Subjunctive

’( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﺴﹶﻲﹾanti tansay; [that] you forget)’( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﺴﹶﻴﹾﻦﹶanti tansayna; you forget)
( ﻳﹶﻨﹾﺴﻰhuwa yansaa; [that] he forget)( ﻳﹶﻨﹾﺴﻰhuwa yansaa; he forgets)
( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﺴﻰhiya tansaa; [that] she forget)( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﺴﻰhiya tansaa; she forgets)
( ﻳﹶﻨﹾﺴﹶﻮﹾﺍhum yansaw; [that] they forget)( ﻳﹶﻨﹾﺴﹶﻮﹾﻥﹶhum yansawna; they forget)
However, when a final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verb has a final long i vowel — written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) — 
in the present, the final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) becomes a consonant in the subjunctive version. 
For example, Table 13-3 shows the subjunctive and present indicative of the Form I 
verb, ( ﺑﹶﻜﻰbakaa; to cry), with a final long i vowel.

( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻲﹶhiya tabkiya; [that] she cry)( ﺗﹶﺒﹾﻜﻲhiya tabkii; she cries)
( ﻳﹶﺒﹾﻜﻮﺍhum yabkuu; [that] they cry)( ﻳﹶﺒﹾﻜﻮﻥﹶhum yabkuuna; they cry)
Using the subjunctive
You use the subjunctive whenever you want to express a situation that may or may 
not have happened. The subjunctive in Arabic is always introduced by certain con-
junctions, just as it is always preceded in Spanish by the conjunction que. Most of 
the time, you use subjunctive after the conjunction ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan; that) in constructions 
expressing wishes. Other conjunctions that precede the subjunctive express purpose 
clauses. In this section, I show you how to form these important and common con-
structions in Arabic.
 
As a rule of thumb, you don’t need to worry about whether the subjunctive is war-
ranted or not. Instead, whenever you naturally find yourself in need of one of the con-
junctions that I demonstrate in this section, you put the verb that follows it in the 
subjunctive.
Working with the conjunction ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan; that)
The conjunction ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan; that) follows a verb expressing wish, necessity, or command. 
In the following example, note that the verb following ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan) is in the subjunctive:
.ﻳﹶﺠﹺﺐﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻧﹸﺴﺎﻓﹺﺮﹶ ﻗﹶﺮﻳﺒﺎﹰ
(yajibu ’an nusaafira qariiban. It is necessary that we travel soon.)
 
I translated the preceding example into English very literally to demonstrate how the 
Arabic expresses that in a sentence. A better English translation of any sentence with 
the subjunctive is frequently to not express the word that at all and render the sub-
junctive as an infinitive. For example, the translation for the previous example may 
sound like this: We have to travel soon.
Arabic uses subjunctive in the preceding sentence construction because the example 
sentence (It is necessary that we travel soon) isn’t really talking about the fact of the 
action; there may be no traveling that actually occurs. The sentence instead is talking 
about the potential need for travel. As such, this is what is called an irreal situation. 
The action may or may not happen at all, and we may not even want the action to 
happen.

Part III: Staying Active: Forming Arabic Verbs 
226
Here are several examples of sentences using the conjunction ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan) followed by a 
subjunctive verb describing irreal situations:
ﻫﹶﻞ ﺳﹶﺄﹶﻟﹾﺘﹺﻪﹺ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹸﺮﹾﺳﹺﻞﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺳﺎﻟﺔﹶ؟
(hal sa’altihi ’an yursila ar-risaalata? Did you ask him to send the letter?)
.ﻳﹸﺮﻳﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺱﹶ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻴﺎﺑﺎﻥﹺ
(yuriidu ’an yadrusa fii-l-yaabaani. He wants to study in Japan.)
Sometimes a verb requires a preposition for its object. When such a verb precedes a 
subjunctive, you can just put the preposition directly in front of the conjunction  ﺃﹶﻥﹾ
’(an; that). Here are some examples with ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan; that) plus a preposition:
.ﻻ ﻳﹶﺴﹾﻤﹶﺢﹸ ﻟﻲ ﺃﹶﺑﻲ ﺑﹺﺄﹶﻥﹾ ﺃﹶﺗﹾﺮﹸﻙﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺪﹾﺭﹶﺳﺔﹶ
(laa yasmaHu lii ’abii bi-’an ’atruka al-madrasata. My father won’t permit me to 
leave school.)
.ﺗﹶﺘﹶﻤﹶﻜﱠﻦﹸ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺗﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹶ ﺍﻹﻧﹾﻜﻠﻴﺰﻳﹼﺔﹶ
(tatamakkanu min ’an tatakallama al-inkliiziyyata. She is able to speak English.)
Expressing purpose in the subjunctive with a few more conjunctions
The subjunctive is the appropriate mood to describe any situation that isn’t yet a 
concrete fact. That holds true for sentences in which you want to express purpose as 
well. If I say, for instance, “They stayed at the library in order to complete the task,” 
you don’t actually know from the sentence whether they completed the task. All you 
really know is that they completed an action for the purpose of completing another. 
For all we know, they got to chatting and still have lots of work to do! For that reason, 
you use the subjunctive in Arabic, along with conjunctions that essentially mean in 
order to, to express purpose in Arabic.
Here are examples of the conjunctions you can use with subjunctive verbs following:
 
 ( ﺣﹶﺘﹼﻰHattaa; until/in order to)
 
  ( ﻛﹶﻲﹾ / ﻟﹺﻜﹶﻲﹾkay/likay; in order to)
 
 ( ﻝﹺli-; to)
And now here are examples using those conjunctions:
.ﺑﹶﻘﹶﻮﹾﺍ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻜﹾﺘﹶﺒﺔﹺ ﺣﹶﺘﹼﻰ ﻳﹸﻜﹾﻤﹺﻠﻮﺍ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻬﹺﻤﹼﺔﹶ
(baqaw fii-l-maktabati Hatta yukmiluu almuhimmata. They stayed at the library 
in order to complete the task.)
.ﻳﹸﺮﻳﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹸﻐﹶﻴﱢﺮﹶ ﻣﹶﻮﹾﻋﹺﺪﹶ ﻃﺎﺋﹺﺮﹶﺗﹺﻪﹺ ﻟﹺﻜﹶﻲﹾ ﻳﹶﺮﹾﺟﹺﻊﹶ ﻓﻲ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡﹺ ﺍﻟﺴﹶﺒﹾﺖﹺ
(yuriidu ’an yughayyira maw3ida Taa’iratihi likay yarji3a fii yawmi as-sabti. 
He wants to change his plane in order to return on Saturday.)

Taking Charge with the Jussive Mood
 
The jussive mood is named as such because one of its uses is to create polite com-
mands. Unlike the subjunctive, we don’t have even a trace of a jussive in English.
Like the subjunctive, the jussive in Arabic doesn’t so much have a meaning but a 
proper context. Instead, there are a number of constructions in which jussive is the 
correct version of the verb to use. In this section, I show you how to create the jus-
sive version of the verb and when you should use it.
Forming the jussive of regular verbs
You produce the jussive by making changes to the suffixes of the verb. Because all 
ten forms of the Arabic verb use the same suffixes, the process of creating the jussive 
is the same for all ten forms. To generate the jussive of a Form I regular verb, you do 
the following:
 
 Change any final ( ﹸDamma) to ( ﹾsukuun).
 
 Remove the suffix ( ﻥﹶna) or ( ﻥﹺni) after any long vowel. Add a superfluous  ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ
’(alif) after any resulting final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw).
 
 Leave the final ( ﻥﹶna) of the feminine plural verbs alone. These verbs are the 
same in all three moods.

 Chapter 13: The Indicative, Jussive, and Subjunctive Moods of the Arabic Verb 229
 
With the exception of the verbs that you change to ( ﹾsukuun), the jussive and sub-
junctive forms are identical when you have three strong consonants in the root.
When you apply the previous three rules to the verb ( ﺷﹶﻜﹶﺮﹶshakara; to thank), the 
conjugations look like those in the following table.
( ﺷﹶﻜﹶﺮﹶshakara; to thank)
’( ﺃﹶﺷﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾanaa ’ashkur)( ﻧﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾnaHnu nashkur)
’( ﺗﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾanta tashkur)
’( ﺗﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﻱanti tashkurii)

( ﺗﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾhiya tashkur)
( ﻳﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﻭﺍhum yashkuruu)
( ﻳﹶﺸﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾﻥﹶhunna yashkurna)
.ﻷﹶﺷﹾﻜﹸﺮﹾ ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺳﻲ ﻟﹺﻤﹸﺴﺎﻋﹶﺪﹶﺗﹺﻪﹺﹺ
(li’ashkur mudarrisii limusaa3adatihi. I should thank my teacher for his help.)
Forming the jussive mood of irregular verbs
The real hallmark of the jussive versions of the verb is that they’re attempting to 
shorten the verb wherever possible. When you have three strong consonants, the 
only way to shorten the verb is to remove all final vowels and the prefixes before long 
vowels. Some of the irregular verbs, however, give the jussive the opportunity to 
reduce the verbs even further.
Final weak verb reductions
Like the subjunctive, final weak verbs are fair game for this reduction. The basic rules 
you use to reduce final weak verbs in the jussive are as follows:
 
 When there’s a final long u — written with a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) — it reduces to a   ﹸ
(Damma).
 
 When there’s a final long a — written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura) — it 
reduces to a (  ﹶfatHa).
 
 When there’s a final long i — written with a ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) — it reduces to a (  ﹺkasra).
Table 13-4 shows you what you get after you apply the rules to the final weak verb  ﺩﹶﻋﺎ
(da3aa; to call). Because the jussive is used for many different constructions and 
expressions, I won’t translate the jussive verbs differently than the indicative.

( ﻳﹶﺒﹾﻜﻮﺍhum yabkuu; they cry)( ﻳﹶﺒﹾﻜﻮﻥﹶhum yabkuuna; they cry)
Medial weak verb reductions
In addition to dropping off the suffixes, verbs with a medial weak letter also reduce 
their medial vowels in the jussive. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on medial weak 
verbs.) You produce the jussive of a medial weak verb with the following rules:

 Chapter 13: The Indicative, Jussive, and Subjunctive Moods of the Arabic Verb 231
 
 Any verb with a ( ﹾsukuun) on the third consonant in the jussive reduces its 
medial long vowel.

 A medial long a — written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — reduces to a ( ﹶfatHa).

Geminate irregularity
 
One curious irregularity in the jussive comes when you have the same second and 
third consonant in the root. These verbs, which are called geminate verbs (see 
Chapter 10), would have had a ( ﹾsukkun) over a doubled letter. However, this really 
isn’t possible to pronounce. As a result, you actually have to add a (  ﹶfatHa) as the 
final vowel. The result is that the jussive and subjunctive of a geminate verb are 
identical.
Table 13-10 shows side by side the present indicative and jussive/subjunctive ver-
sions for the geminate verb ( ﻋﹶﺪﱠ3adda; to count).

( ﻳﹶﻌﹸﺪﹼﻭﺍhum ya3udduu; they count)( ﻳﹶﻌﹸﺪﹼﻭﻥﹶhum ya3udduuna; they count)
Using the jussive mood
 
A handy use of the jussive is to create indirect commands. To produce an indirect 
command, you add the particle ( ﻟﹺli-; to) to the jussive. Often, you can translate the 
resulting verb with the sense of let’s do something. Here’s a demonstration of this use 
of the jussive:
.ﻟﹺﻨﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹾ ﻣﹶﻌﺎﹰ
(linatakallam ma3an. Let’s speak together.)

 Chapter 13: The Indicative, Jussive, and Subjunctive Moods of the Arabic Verb 233
Often, you see the particle ( ﻓﹶfa-) attached before the ( ﻟﹺli-), which then takes a   ﹾ
(sukuun). Here is an example:
.ﻓﹶﻠﹾﻨﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺐﹾ
(falnadh-hab. Let’s go.)
Several of the more important uses of the jussive are covered in other chapters of this 
book. For example, to see the use of jussive to create a negative command and pro-
duce a negated past tense, refer to Chapter 17. To see the jussive used in a conditional 
sentence, consult Chapter 14.
 
For each of the following items, I give you a pronoun and verb in the present indica-
tive. Produce the correct jussive verb for each.

(My friend,
I want to explain to you what happened yesterday. But first you need to understand the situation. I was working at 
the office typing on the computer. I wanted to print an article, but I didn’t have paper. I went to the storeroom 
to find a box of paper. At the same time the director’s assistant arrived there to look for a pen. As for me, I am 
really in love with her, but I have never told her. I wanted her to notice me, so I tried to say to her: “May I help 
you?” But my heart said something else, and I heard these words coming from me: “May I kiss you?” She turned 
red and left me there. The director immediately fired me from the company. So now I need to find a new job. I 
spoke with a man in the office near my former office. And they may give me a job there. I want to get a job there so 
that I see the young lady from time to time.)

use small but mighty words to form sentences such as 
conditionals. You also add valuable words, including con-
junctions, to your inventory. I provide a chapter on the 
verbal noun, which is the smallest form of the verb but 
important for many parts of speech. Negation is also 
important in communication, so I show you how to add not

f you’ve worked through the preceding chapters, you’ve practiced quite a bit of 
Arabic! Just think: If you hadn’t picked up a copy of Intermediate Arabic For 
Dummies, you would have missed all the fun!
The preceding two sentences are conditional sentences. What’s that, you ask? A condi-
tional sentence is one that discusses hypothetical situations and their consequences.
 
Whenever you describe a situation in English that may or may not happen, you usu-
ally form a sentence that starts with the word if. However, forming conditional sen-
tences in Arabic requires you to choose the correct word for if. You also have to 
determine which tense and mood is the best choice for the conditional sentence you 
want to express.
This chapter gives you the information you need to confidently enter the Arabic 
world of “what if?” You’ll encounter the parts of the conditional sentence, a list of 
Arabic words for if, and some handy tips for selecting the correct type of verb to go in 
your sentence.
Seeing the Condition and Result in Sentences
Anytime you use the word if, you’re talking about a hypothetical situation (something 
that may or may not happen). These conditional sentences each have two parts. 
Grammarians call the part of the sentence introduced by the word if the protasis. This 
is the part of the sentence that affects the outcome of the second part, which is called 
the apodosis. In this book, I call them the condition clause and the result clause as 
shown in Table 14-1.

240
Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
Table 14-1 
The Main Parts of Conditional Sentences
Protasis (Condition Clause)
Apodosis (Result Clause)
If I had lived in Roman times,
I would have liked to have been a gladiator.
If I have the time,
I will surely come to your party.
In English, the condition clause and the result clause can actually come in reverse 
order and still produce a conditional sentence. For example, consider this sentence: 
You won’t learn as quickly if you don’t complete the practice exercises.
The first part of the sentence (You won’t learn as quickly . . .) is the result clause of 
the second part of the sentence (. . . if you don’t complete the practice exercises), 
which is the condition clause. In this sentence, you can also replace the word if with 
unless without changing the meaning. So, one half of the sentence tells you what may 
or may not happen, and the other half tells you the result.
 
In Arabic, the result clause comes before the condition clause much more rarely than 
in English. That’s not to say it’s never done, but that construction is definitely not as 
common as in English.
Forming Simple Conditional 
Sentences in Arabic
In Arabic, conditional sentences can take on two basic forms:
 
 Simple
 
 Contrary to fact
In this section, I discuss simple conditional sentences. You can read about contrary 
to fact conditional sentences in the later section, “Getting to Know Contrary to Fact 
Conditional Sentences.”
A simple conditional sentence describes a situation that could have happened or still 
could happen. For example, “If I have the time, I will surely come to your party.” In 
the condition clause of this example, it isn’t yet clear whether the person will have 
the time (and thus whether he or she will come to the party). A simple conditional 
sentence includes two primary variations: past tense indicative and jussive. And, of 
course, there are some exceptions and twists!
 
English has one workhorse word to introduce conditional sentences: if. English distin-
guishes between different types of conditional situations through the use of grammat-
ical moods. By contrast, Arabic uses different words to introduce conditional 
sentences, depending on whether they’re simple or contrary to fact. Because most 
conditional sentences are of the simple type, you will most often use the Arabic word 
for if reserved for this style of conditional sentence: ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha).

241
 Chapter 14: Forming Conditional Sentences
 
Be careful not to form an Arabic simple conditional sentence with a word for word 
substitution of English words and tenses. Someone reading what you write in this 
case will probably still understand what you mean, but he or she will also be aware 
that your Arabic needs help.
In this section, I show you the Arabic word that’s used for if in simple conditional sen-
tences. I also walk you through the past indicative and show you how to add a nega-
tive to a simple conditional sentence.
Using ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha) for if
If learning the word for if was all you needed to know in order to write simple condi-
tional sentences in Arabic, you would be set up for success. But I have good news and 
bad news. The bad news is that writing simple conditional sentences is just a little 
more complicated than simply knowing the Arabic word for if. But the good news is 
that you form conditional sentences in Arabic without needing to understand any 
new forms of the verb. In fact, you just have to get used to using the past tense for 
everything, even when you’re referring to the present or future. See what I mean 
about past tense in the later section “Applying past tense indicative.”
 
Modern Standard Arabic has a special word for if that’s used when you want to form a 
simple conditional sentence. That word is ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha). And in Arabic, the condition 
clause usually comes first. To finish the job of creating your simple conditional sen-
tence, all you have to do next is state the verbs of both the conditional clause and the 
result clause in the past tense.
Applying past tense indicative
To get a feel for how conditional sentences would sound in English with only past 
tense verbs, take a look at the following examples:
If you studied this book, you learned many things.
If I saw my friend, I was happy.
If he wanted, he was able to come too.
These sentences (translated literally) may seem strange to English speakers. On the face of 
it, you may wonder how the speaker has forgotten whether he saw his friend. But this is 
just how Arabic forms simple conditional sentences. What the Arabic means here is this: If I 
see my friend, I will be happy. The Arabic, however, puts both verbs in the past tense.
In the following Arabic versions of the same sentences, the verbs are really past 
tense, but a good English translation of past tense verbs in a conditional sentence is 
to express them as present tense:
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺩﹶﺭﹶﺳﹾﺖﹶ ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﹾﻜﹺﺘﺎﺏ ﺗﹶﻌﹶﻠﱠﻤﹾﺖﹶ ﺃﹶﺷﹾﻴﺎﺀ ﻛﹶﺜﻴﺮﹶﺓ
’(idhaa darasta hadha-l-kitaab, ta3alamta’ashyaa’ kathiira. If you study this 
book, you’ll learn many things.)

242
Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺖﹸ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﻲ ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹸ ﻣﹶﺴﹾﺮﻭﺭﺍﹰ
’(idhaa ra’aytu Sadiiqii, kuntu masruuran. If I see my friend, I’ll be happy.)
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺍﺭﺍﺩﹶ ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻄﺎﻉﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺤﹾﻀﹸﺮﹶ ﺃﹶﻳﹾﻀﺎﹰ
’(idhaa araada, istaTaa3a ’an yaHDura ’ayDan. If he wants, he can come too.)
Using past tense this way may seem a bit confusing at first, but once you get used to 
it, you’ll be grateful that simple conditional sentences in Arabic are so easy. After all, 
in many languages, an entirely new form of the verb is required for this situation. In 
Arabic, on the other hand, you just need to use the most basic form of the verb.
 
Using the past tense in both the condition and result clauses is the most common 
method of forming conditional sentences in Arabic. A simple conditional sentence, 
however, can involve other tenses in the result clause. You may, for instance, use 
imperative or future tense. Just remember that when you do use something besides 
 
the past tense in a simple conditional sentence, you must add the prefix ( ﻓﹶfa-) to the 
result clause.
Here are a few examples of other tenses in the result clauses of simple conditional 
sentences:
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻄﹶﻌﹾﺖﹸ ﻓﹶﻘﹸﻞﹾ ﻟﻲ ﺳﹶﺮﱠﻙﹶ ﻣﹺﻦ ﻓﹶﻀﹾﻠﹺﻚﹶ
’(idhaa istaTa3ta, fa-qul lii sirraka min faDlika. If you can, please tell me your 
secret.)
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺃﹶﺭﹶﺩﹾﺕﹶ ﻓﹶﺴﹶﺄﹶﻗﻮﻟﹸﻪﹸ ﻟﹶﻚﹶ
’(idhaa ’aradta, fa-sa’aquuluhu laka. If you want, I will tell it to you.)
So you can identify them easily, I underline the verbs that are in some other tense 
besides past. In the first example, you have an imperative. In the second case, you 
can see a future tense verb. Each one, as per the requirement, has the prefix ( ﻓﹶfa-) on 
it first.
Adding a negative to a simple conditional 
sentence
 
When you need to add a negative to your simple conditional sentence, you can’t use 
the normal negative particle ( ﻣﺎmaa; not) with the past tense verb. Instead, you use 
 ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam; not) plus the jussive forms of the verb in the condition clause. (For more on 
 
using [ ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam] to negate sentences, check out Chapter 17.) You also have to add the 
 
prefix ( ﻓﹶfa-) to the result clause (as I discuss in the previous section).
Here are a few examples:
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﺰﹸﺭﹾ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﹶﻪﹸ ﻓﹶﻠﹶﻦﹾ ﺗﹶﻜﻮﻥﹶ ﻣﹶﺴﹾﺮﻭﺭﺓﹰ ﻣﹶﻌﹶﻪﹸ
’(idhaa lam yazur jaddatahu, fa-lan takuna masruuratan ma3ahu. If he doesn’t 
visit his grandmother, she won’t be happy with him.)

243
 Chapter 14: Forming Conditional Sentences
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﺗﹶﻜﹸﻦﹾ ﻣﹸﺘﹶﺄﹶﻛﱢﺪﺍﹰ ﻣﹺﻦﹾ ﺇﺟﺎﺑﹶﺘﹺﻚﹶ ﻓﹶﻼ ﺗﹸﺨﹶﻤﱢﻦﹾ
’(idhaa lam takun muta’akkidan min ’ijaabatika, fa-laa tukhammin. If you aren’t 
sure about your answer, don’t guess.)
 
For each of the English sentences I give you in the following practice set, translate 
them into Arabic using the word ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha). For items 1–5, use the past tense of the 
verb in both the condition clause and the result clause. In item 6 you need to use a 
negative verb (covered in Chapter 17). For item 7, use a command (go to Chapter 11 if 
you’re uncertain about these). Item 8 requires a future tense (which you can discover 
in Chapter 2).
 Q. If you agree, we would do that.
 A. .’( ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹶ ﻣﹸﻮﺍﻓﹺﻘﺎﹰ ﻓﹶﻌﹶﻠﻨﺎ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶidhaa kunta muwaafiqan fa3alnaa dhaalika.)

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
Getting to Know Contrary to Fact 
Conditional Sentences
In most simple conditional sentences, there’s at least the potential for the condition 
to come true. The contrary to fact conditional, on the other hand, involves things that 
can never be true at all. An English example would be something like this: If I had 
lived in Roman times, I would have liked to have been a gladiator. Until time travel 
exists outside of science fiction, neither you nor I will be able to actually go back to 
the days of yore.
Here are some additional English examples about circumstances that didn’t happen 
or could never happen (okay, maybe you could become a king, but it isn’t likely):
If I were king, things would be different.
If I had gone to the party (but I didn’t), I would have seen my friend there.
 
The good news for you is that contrary to fact conditional sentences are even easier 
to form in Arabic than they are in English. After all, sometimes in English you hear 
someone say, “If I was in charge, things would be different.” But if you’re in tune to 
your grammar, you know that this is wrong! The correct statement is, “If I were in 
charge, things would be different.” English has a special form of certain verbs that’s 
used when you form contrary to fact conditionals. In this particular case, “were” is 
the subjunctive form, used in English to properly form conditions contrary to fact. 
Creating contrary to fact sentences in Arabic is much easier than all that. In Arabic, 
all you need to do is use a different word for if and use the past tense in both parts of 
the sentence.
In this section, I show you the Arabic word used for if in contrary to fact conditional 
sentences. I also explain how to be negative and contrary at the same time.
Expressing contrary to fact 
conditionals with ( ﻟﹶﻮﹾlaw)
Arabic has a word for if that’s reserved only for use in contrary to fact conditional 
sentences. That word is ( ﻟﹶﻮﹾlaw), and it’s translated as if, just like the word  ﺇﺫﺍ
’(idhaa) within simple conditional sentences.
When creating contrary to fact sentences in Arabic, you have to use the prefix ( ﻟﹶla-). 
You put the ( ﻟﹶla-) at the beginning of the result clause, but you don’t translate it. It’s 
just a stylistic conjunction required by Arabic at this particular spot.
 
To express a contrary to fact conditional sentence in Arabic, follow these steps:
 
1. Introduce the condition clause with the particle ( ﻟﹶﻮﹾlaw).
 
2. Add the prefix ( ﻟﹶla-) to the result clause.
 
3. Use the past tense in both the condition and result clauses.

245
 Chapter 14: Forming Conditional Sentences
Here are a few examples of contrary to fact conditional sentences:
.ﻟﹶﻮﹾ ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ ﻟﹶﺮﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻷﹶﻫﹾﺮﺍﻡ
(law dhahabtu ’ilaa miSr, lara’aytu al-ahraam. If I had gone to Egypt, I would 
have seen the Pyramids.)
.ﻟﹶﻮﹾ ﺭﹶﺃﻯ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﻔﻴﻠﻢ ﻟﹶﻜﺎﻥﹶ ﻣﹸﻮﺍﻓﹺﻘﺎﹰ ﻣﹶﻌﻲ
(law ra’a hadha-l-film, lakaana muwaafiqan ma3ii. If he had seen that movie, he 
would have agreed with me.)
.ﻟﻮ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻫﹸﻢﹾ ﻣﹺﻠﹾﻴﻮﻥ ﺩﻭﻻﺭ ﻟﹶﺸﹾﺘﹶﺮﻭﺍ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(law kaana 3indahum milyuun dolaar, la-shtaruu al-bayt. If they had a million 
dollars, they would buy the house.)
In the previous examples, I underline the two past tense verbs of the conditional and 
result clauses. You can see that in each case, there’s the addition of the prefix ( ﻟﹶla-) 
before the second past tense verb. Also note, however, that the English translation 
reflects the unreal situation posed by a contrary to fact sentence.
Adding the negative to contrary to fact 
conditional sentences
 
When you need to add a negative to your contrary to fact conditional sentence, you 
 
use ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam; not) plus the jussive forms of the verb in the condition clause, and  ﻣﺎ
(maa; not) plus the past tense in the result clause. To read more about the use of  ﻣﺎ
 
(maa) and ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam; not), flip to Chapter 17.
In the following examples, I underline the verbs, preceded by their words for not so 
that you can easily spot them:
.ﻟﻮ ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺳﹺﻞﹾ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﺮﹾﺩ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺍﻟﺨﹶﻤﻴﺲ ﻟﹶﻤﺎ ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶ ﻟﹺﺤﹶﺒﻴﺒﹶﺘﻲ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ
(law lam ’ursil aT-Tard yawm al-khamiis lamaa waSala liHabiibatii ’amsi. If I hadn’t 
sent the package on Thursday, my girlfriend would not have received it yesterday.)
.ﻟﻮ ﻓﺎﺯﹶﺕﹾ ﻓﹺﺮﹾﻗﹶﺘﻲ ﻟﹶﻤﺎ ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹸ ﺣﹶﺰﻳﻨﺎﹰ ﺍﻵﻥﹶ
(law faaza firqatii lamaa kuntu Haziinan al’aana. If my team had won, I wouldn’t

In this practice set, I give you several simple conditional sentences. Convert them 
 
into contrary to fact conditional sentences by replacing ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha) with ( ﻟﹶﻮﹾlaw) and 
 
adding the particle ( ﻟla-) to the result clause. Then translate your newly created con-
trary to fact conditional sentence into English.

Tackling the Jussive in Simple Conditional 
Sentences
Jussive comes from a Latin word meaning to order. You can use the jussive mood in what 
are very polite orders, such as ( ﻓﹶﻠﹾﻨﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺐﹾfalnadh-hab; Let’s go). Because the jussive is a 
mood that you can use in unreal situations, the jussive can be used in simple conditional 
sentences. A simple conditional sentence using jussive won’t impart a meaning different 
from one using just past tense (to see the use of past tense verbs refer to the earlier sec-
tion “Applying past tense indicative”). But you want to know how to form a conditional 
sentence with jussive so you can vary your own writing style and also make sense of con-
ditional sentences formed with jussive that you come across in your reading.
 
To use the jussive in a conditional sentence, you can start with a past tense verb in the con-
dition clause, just like you would for a simple conditional sentence (see the earlier section 
“Forming Simple Conditional Sentences in Arabic” for more information). In the result 
 
clause, you use a jussive form of the verb, following the addition of the particle ( ﻓﹶfa-).
The particle ( ﻓﹶfa-) is left untranslated, because it’s a stylistic necessity of Arabic in a 
simple conditional sentence with the jussive, not a meaning-bearing word as such. 
However, ( ﻓﹶfa-) does have the translatable meaning of and so/and then in other 
contexts. (To discover further details about the use of ( ﻓﹶfa-), see Chapter 15.)
Here are a few examples of simple conditional sentences using the jussive in the 
result clause:

’(idhaa darasta hadha-l-kitaab, fatata3allam ’ashyaa’ kathiira. If you study this 
book, you’d learn many things.)
.ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﺭﹶﺃﹶﻳﹾﺖﹸ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﻲ ﻓﹶﺄﹶﻛﹸﻦﹾ ﻣﹶﺴﹾﺮﻭﺭﺍﹰ

’(idhaa araada, fayastaTi3 ’an yaHDura ’ayDan. If he wants, he can come too.)
In the previous examples, I underline the verbs to help you quickly locate them. 
Notice that all the verbs in the condition clause are past tense. The result clauses, 
however, have verbs in the jussive, each one preceded by the particle ( ﻓﹶfa-).
 
Until you have fully mastered the jussive, get in the habit of just using past tense for 
all your conditional sentences. It’s grammatically correct, and it’s easier to work with 
than the jussive.
 
The following sentences are conditionals that currently use past tense in both parts. 
Rewrite each sentence, adding the prefix ( ﻓfa-) to the result clause and changing the 
verb in that clause to the jussive.

Finding  ’(  ﺇﹺﻥﹾin) in Classical 
Conditional Sentences
At one time, ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha) was used to imply more potential for the conditional sentence 
coming true. By contrast, ’( ﺇﹺﻥﹾin) implied a more hypothetical situation. In Modern 
Standard Arabic today, however, ’( ﺇﺫﺍidha) has become the standard word for all 
conditional sentences. You may see ’( ﺇﹺﻥﹾin) used in classical texts, but it’s no longer a 
commonly used word. It survives today within the phrase you should use whenever 
referring to the future: ’( ﺇﹺﻥﹾ ﺷﺎﺀ ﺍﷲin shaa’ ’allah; if God wills it). (To see more about 
the use and formation of the future tense, visit Chapter 2.) But don’t get in the habit 
of using ’( ﺇﹺﻥﹾin) regularly in your own writing. It would make it sound overly formal 
and maybe even stuffy. I’m only showing you this particle so you recognize it when 
you see it in classical texts and quotes.

Chapter 15
Picking Up the Pieces Using 
Particles and Partitives
In This Chapter
 Discovering simple and temporal conjunctions
 Looking into Arabic partitive nouns
T
wo particular pieces of Arabic grammar come together in this chapter: particles 
and partitives. Arab grammarians traditionally divided their language into just 
three categories: nouns, verbs, and, well, everything else. The name they gave to this 
“everything else” category is ( ﺣﹸﺮﻭﻑHuruuf), meaning particles. If you’ve read through 
other chapters of this book, you’ve probably already seen many things that qualify as 
particles. Just like particles of dust in the air, Arabic particles are everywhere!
In the first part of this chapter, I give you an overview of Arabic particles. Then I focus 
on two important types of particles: simple and temporal conjunctions. Conjunctions 
are those words you use to bind or divide parts of your sentence. The most basic and 
important of the conjunctions is ( ﻭwa-; and). But I explain several others that you can 
use to polish your Arabic writing.
In the second part of the chapter, I present the Arabic partitive nouns. Partitives are 
the words you use to talk about “parts” of a noun. In other words, they indicate 
whether you’re discussing all, some, or most of something.
Examining Arabic Particles
There’s a reason that the Arabic word for particle, ( ﺣﹸﺮﻭﻑHuruuf), is the same word 
used for letters (of the alphabet). It’s because they’re both tiny little things. Languages 
tend to use small words for important and common tasks and reserve multiple sylla-
ble words for rarer things. Imagine how tired your tongue would be at the end of the 
day if the word for and were as long as antidisestablishmentarianism! Many different 
types of words qualify as particles. Included are prepositions, conjunctions, and even 
words such as ( ﻻlaa; no/not), which makes a verb negative. I show you the particles 
for making sentences negative in Chapter 17. And you can explore prepositions in 
detail in Chapter 12.

252
Pulling Sentences Together 
Using Arabic Conjunctions
Arabic offers you a variety of ways to join words. Sometimes you just need to bind 
two words with ( ﻭwa-; and). Other times you need something more sophisticated 
than that. So, in this section, I delve into the most common conjunctions that you 
may encounter and use to combine words and longer phrases. I break them down 
into two categories: simple and temporal.
Simple conjunctions
 
What grammarians call simple conjunctions are those words that either join or sepa-
rate words and phrases in a sentence. Now, just because they’re called simple doesn’t 
mean they aren’t important. You’re about to see that these words can give you some 
powerful ways to express yourself in Arabic. The most common simple conjunctions, 
which I show you in the following sections, include the following: and, when, and/and 
so/and then, but, or, and because. I also toss in a few other essential conjunctions that 
fall into the miscellaneous category.
( ﻭﹶwa-; and)
The conjunction ( ﻭﹶwa-; and) is probably the most important conjunction of all. You 
add ( ﻭﹶwa-) as a prefix to words when you want to say and. Here’s an example of this 
powerful conjunction in action:
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺐﹶ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪﹸ ﻭﹶﻣﹶﺮﹾﻭﺍﻥ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻠﹾﻌﹶﺐ ﻭﹶﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺭﹶﺟﹶﻌﺎ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(dhahaba ’aHmadu wa-marwaan ’ilaa-l-mal3ab wa-ba3da dhaalika raja3aa 
’ilaa-l-bayt. Ahmad and Marwan went to the stadium, and after that they returned to 
the house.)
Notice that the conjunction in the previous example joins two people, Ahmad and 
Marwan, but also joins two clauses together the second time it occurs.
Here’s a useful trick you can perform with the conjunction ( ﻭﹶwa-). You can create a 
circumstantial clause just by joining a few words or a separate sentence to your main 
sentence with wa-.
A circumstantial clause is a phrase or sentence that tells your reader some important 
background information (the circumstances) about your main topic. For instance, I 
could tell you that I went to France. But if I tell you that I went to France when I was in 
college, I would be adding information that’s circumstantial to my main topic (going 
to France). You can create a circumstantial clause in Arabic by putting ( ﻭﹶwa-) in 
place of when in the example I just used. Here’s the Arabic equivalent:
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻓﹶﺮﹶﻧﹾﺴﺎ ﻭﹶﺃﹶﻧﺎ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻜﹸﻠﱢﻴﺔ
(dhahabtu ’ilaa faransaa wa-’anaa fii-l-kulliya. I went to France when I was in 
college.)

 Chapter 15: Picking Up the Pieces Using Particles and Partitives 253
 
Keep in mind that it isn’t the case that ( ﻭﹶwa-; and) means when just because we 
translate it that way in English. Rather, Arabic uses the conjunction to create a cir-
cumstantial clause. Here are more examples of the conjunction wa- creating circum-
stantial clauses:
.ﺗﹶﻌﹶﻠﱠﻤﹶﺖﹾ ﺗﹺﻠﹾﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﻠﱡﻐﺔ ﻭﹶﻫﹺﻲﹶ ﻃﺎﻟﹺﺒﺔﹲ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﻣﹺﻌﺔ
(ta3allamat tilka-l-lugha wa-hiya Taalibatun fi-l-jaami3a. She learned that lan-
guage when she was a student at the university.)
.ﻧﹶﺰﹶﻝﹶ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﺋﹺﺮﺓ ﻭﹶﻫﹸﻮﹶ ﻳﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹸ ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﹺﻪﹺ
(nazala min aT-Taa’ira wa-huwa yatakallamu ma3a Sadiiqihi. He got off the 
plane while talking with his friend.)
( ﻓﹶfa-; and/and so/and then)
In addition to ( ﻭﹶwa-), Arabic has the conjunction ( ﻓﹶfa-), which also translates as and 
in many contexts. The main difference between the two is that ( ﻓﹶfa-) ordinarily 
implies that the two things you’re binding together are happening in a certain order. 
Most of the time, you use ( ﻓﹶfa-) to put together two phrases that happen one after 
another. In this case, you can translate ( ﻓﹶfa-) as simply and, or you could translate it 
as and so or and then (depending on what sounds best in that context). Like wa-, you 
attach fa- as a prefix to the first word in your new clause.
Here are a few examples of ( ﻓﹶfa-) in action:
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺐﹶ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪﹸ ﻭﹶﻣﹶﺮﹾﻭﺍﻥ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻠﹾﻌﹶﺐ ﻓﹶﺮﹶﺟﹶﻌﺎ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(dhahaba ’aHmadu wa-marwaan ’ilaa-l-mal3ab fa-raja3a ’ilaa-l-bayt. Ahmad and 
Marwan went to the stadium, and then they returned to the house.)
.ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﻱ ﺧﹸﺒﹾﺰﹲ ﻓﹶﻴﹶﺠﹺﺐﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺃﹶﺫﹾﻫﹶﺐﹶ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﻮﻕ
(laysa 3indii khubzun fa-yajib ’an ’adh-haba ’ilaa-s-suuq. I don’t have bread, and 
so I need to go to the market.)
Notice that the conjunctions here are identical. It’s the English context that requires 
slightly different translations. In the first example, the conjunction focuses on the 
temporal relationship between the clauses. In the second example, the main point is 
the logical connection between the clauses. But the Arabic conjunction is the same 
for both.
( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾ / ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakin/laakinna; but)
Arabic has two forms of the word for but. Those two forms are ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾlaakin) and  ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠ
(laakinna).
The word ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾlaakin) is the simple version of but in Arabic. You can simply insert it 
as a separate word between two clauses when you want to express exclusion. It can 
occur before a verb or a noun in the nominative case (unlike [ ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakinna], which 
requires accusative).

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
254
Here are a few examples of ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾlaakin):
.ﻳﹸﺮﻳﺪﻭﻥﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﻮﺍ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾ ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻫﹸﻢ ﻣﺎﻝﹲ ﻛﹶﺜﻴﺮﹲ
(yuriiduuna ’an ya’kuluu hunaaka, laakin laysa 3indahum maalun kathiirun. 
They want to eat there, but they don’t have much money.)
.ﺗﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺱﹸ ﻓﺎﻃﹺﻤﺔ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﻳﺎﺿﹺﻴﹼﺎﺕ ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾ ﻳﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺱﹸ ﺃﺧﻮﻫﺎ ﺍﻟﻬﹶﻨﹾﺪﹶﺳﺔ
(tadrusu faaTima aririyaaDiyaat, lakin yadrusu ’akhuhaa al-handasa. Fatima 
studies mathematics, but her brother studies engineering.)
( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakinna) also means but; however, it behaves differently than ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾlaakin).  ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠ
(laakinna) can’t be followed immediately by a verb. Instead, you have to follow it 
with the subject of the verb, either a noun (in the accusative case) or an object pro-
noun attached to ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakinna).
Here are some examples of ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakinna):
.ﻳﹸﻌﺠﹺﺒﹸﻨﻲ ﺍﻟﻔﻴﻠﻢ ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻤﹶﺜﱢﻠﻴﻦﹶ ﻳﹸﺰﹾﻋﹺﺠﻮﻧﹶﻨﻲ ﻛﹶﺜﻴﺮﺍﹰ
(yu3jibuni al-fiilm, laakinna-l-mumaththiliina yuz3ijuunani kathirran. I like the 
film, but the actors really bother me.)
.ﺗﹶﺸﹾﺮﹸﺏﹸ ﺯﹶﻭﹾﺟﹶﺘﻲ ﻛﹶﺜﻴﺮﺍﹰ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺍﻟﺸﹼﺎﻱ ﻟﻜﹺﻨﱠﻨﻲ ﺃﹸﻓﹶﻀﱢﻞﹸ ﺍﻟﻘﹶﻬﹾﻮﺓ
(tashrubu zawjatii kathiiran min ash-shaay, laakinnanii ’ufaDDilu al-qahwa. My 
wife drinks a lot of tea, but I prefer coffee.)
 
There are two equally valid ways of adding the object pronoun for ’( ﺃﹶﻧﺎanaa; I) and  ﻧﹶﺤﹾﻦﹸ
(naHnu; we). One way is to assimilate the initial n sound into the doubled n of lakinna. The 
other way is to keep them as separate sounds. There’s no difference in meaning and no time 
when either option is more correct than the other. This example illustrates your options:
( ﻟﻜﹺﻨﹼﻲlaakinni; but I . . . )
( ﻟﻜﹺﻨﱠﻨﻲlaakinnanii; but I . . . )
’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾ / ﺃﹶﻡﹾaw/’am; or)
The words ’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾaw) and ’( ﺃﹶﻡﹾam) both mean or. The only difference between them is 
that you use ’( ﺃﹶﻡﹾam) when you need to express or within a question. By contrast, you 
use ’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾaw) in any sentence that isn’t a question.
Here’s an example using ’( ﺃﹶﻭﹾaw):
.ﺳﹶﺄﹶﻛﹾﺘﹸﺐﹸ ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﺔﹰ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡ ﺃﹶﻭﹾ ﺳﹶﺄﹶﺗﱠﺼﹺﻞﹸ ﺑﹺﺤﹶﺒﻴﺒﹶﺘﻲ
(sa’aktubu risaalatan al-yawm, ’aw sa’attaSilu biHabiibatii. I will write a letter 
today, or I will call my girlfriend.)
And to better understand the distinction between the two, check out this example 
that uses ’( ﺃﹶﻡﹾam):
ﻫﹶﻞﹾ ﺗﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺒﻴﻦﹶ ﻣﹶﻌﹶﻨﺎ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﻴﻨﹶﻤﺎ ﺃﹶﻡﹾ ﻻ؟
(hal tadh-habiina ma3anaa ’ila-s-siinama ’am laa? Will you go to the cinema with 
us or not?)

 Chapter 15: Picking Up the Pieces Using Particles and Partitives 255
( ﻷﹶﻥﱠli’anna; because)
The word for because in Arabic is ( ﻷﹶﻥﱠli’anna). Like ( ﻟﻜﹺﻦﱠlaakinna; but), which is 
discussed earlier in the chapter, you use an accusative noun immediately after  ﻷﹶﻥﱠ
(li’anna). Or you can also add an object pronoun to it (see Chapters 4 and 12 for 
more on object pronouns). If you have a verb after the conjunction, you put the 
object pronoun on first. If you have a noun as a subject, it goes immediately after the 
conjunction and is expressed in the accusative case.
Here are two examples:
.ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺼﹾﺮﹺﻑﹸ ﻣﹶﻘﹾﻔﻮﻝﹲ ﻷﹶﻥﱠ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡﹶ ﻫﹸﻮﹶ ﻋﻴﺪ ﺍﻟﻌﹸﻤﹼﺎﻝ
(al-maSrifu maqfuulun li’anna al-yawma huwa 3iid al’3ummaal. The bank is 
closed today because it’s Labor Day.)
.ﺍﻷﹶﻭﹾﻻﺩ ﺟﺎﺋﹺﻌﻮﻥﹶ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ ﻷﹶﻧﱠﻬﹸﻢ ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﺄﹾﻛﹸﻠﻮﺍ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪ
(al-’awlaad jaa’i3uuna jiddan li’annahum lam ya’kuluu ba3d. The children are 
very hungry because they haven’t eaten yet.)
Temporal conjunctions
 
Temporal conjunctions bind clauses together with the information of when they hap-
pened or in what order. In Modern Standard Arabic, the most common temporal con-
 
junction to express the concept of when something happened is ( ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ3indamaa). 
Here are a couple examples to illustrate its use:
.ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹸ ﺻﹶﻐﻴﺮﺍﹰ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﺍﹺﺷﹾﺘﹶﺮﹶﻳﹾﻨﺎ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ
(kuntu Saghiiran 3indamaa ishtaraynaa dhalika-l-bayt. I was young when we 
bought that house.)
.ﺳﹶﻨﹶﺴﹾﺘﹶﻘﹾﺒﹺﻞﹸ ﺃﹶﺧﺎﻧﺎ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﻳﹶﺼﹺﻞﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﺎﺭ
(sa-nastaqbilu akhaana 3indamaa yaSilu ’ilaa-l-maTaar. We’ll greet our brother 
when he arrives at the airport.)
You can create conjunctions in Arabic to say that something happened before or after 
something else by adding temporal prepositions to the conjunction ’( ﺃﹶﻥﹾan).
Here’s an example using ( ﻗﹶﺒﹾﻞﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾqabla ’an; before):
.ﻋﹶﻤﹺﻞﹶ ﺃﹶﺑﻲ ﻟﹺﻤﹸﺪﹼﺓ ﺧﹶﻤﹾﺴﻴﻦﹶ ﺳﹶﻨﺔ ﻗﹶﺒﹾﻞﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺗﹶﻘﺎﻋﹶﺪﹶ
(3amila ’abii li-muddat khamsiina sana qabla ’an taqaa3ada. My father worked 
fifty years before he retired.)
Here’s an example using ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾba3da ’an; after):
.ﺳﺎﻓﹶﺮﹶﺕﹾ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻗﹶﻄﹶﺮ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻏﺎﺩﹶﺭﹶﺕﹾ ﺍﻟﻜﹸﻮﹶﻳﹾﺖ
(saafarat ’ila qaTar ba3da ’an ghaadarat al-kuwayt. She traveled to Qatar after 
she left Kuwait.)

256
( ﻣﹸﻨﹾﺬﹸmundhu) is another temporal conjunction. You may recall seeing this particle 
as a preposition that means ago, as in this example:
.ﺍﹺﻟﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺑﹺﻪﹺ ﻣﹸﻨﺬﹸ ﺛﹶﻼﺙ ﺳﹶﻨﹶﻮﺍﺕ
(iltaqaytu bihi mundhu thalaath sanawaat. I met him three years ago.)
As a temporal conjunction, however, ( ﻣﹸﻨﹾﺬﹸmundhu) means since:
.ﻗﹶﺪﹾ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﺒﹶﺒﺘﹸﻪﹸ ﻣﹸﻨﹾﺬﹸ ﺍﹺﻟﹾﺘﹶﻘﹶﻴﹾﺖﹸ ﺑﹺﻪﹺ
(qad ’aHbabtuhu mundhu iltaqaytu bihi. I’ve liked him since I met him.)
 
In the following practice set, I give you a number of sentences with missing conjunctions. 
Each sentence is best completed by inserting one of the conjunctions supplied in the 
word bank. You may need to add object suffixes from clues elsewhere in the sentence. 
 
Each word is used once. ( ﻷﹶﻥﱠli’anna), however, is used once in the example and once in 
 
the actual practice set. Write the sentence with the conjunction on the line provided.

Parceling Noun Quantity with 
the Arabic Partitives
You’ve probably heard the old adage, “You can fool some of the people all of the 
time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all 
of the time.” Whoever first said these words (they’ve been attributed to Abraham 
Lincoln and P.T. Barnum), made extensive use of a class of nouns known as partitives. 
Partitives in English frequently are used with the preposition of to express how much 
of something you have.
In some languages, such as Spanish, partitives are adjectives. Arabic partitives, how-
ever, behave in much the same way as English partitives. For example, you may say 
all of, some of, or most of something. In the same way, Arabic partitives come directly 
in front of the noun that they’re modifying. There are Arabic partitives to express all 
the potential quantities of a noun that English expresses. Really, all you need to do is 
learn them as vocabulary items, and you’re more than halfway to mastering them.
The Arabic partitives are a strange class of nouns. They function grammatically as 
nouns, having case, but they’re somewhat defective in that they don’t themselves 
have a plural. Instead, they convey the various shades of partitive meaning to what-
ever nouns you place immediately after them.
 
To use an Arabic partitive, you put the partitive in an ’iDaafa construction with the 
noun you want to modify. The meaning of the partitive can change depending on 
whether its noun is singular or plural and whether it has the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). I explain 
exactly how you change the translation as I show you each individual partitive. (If you 
want to review the formation of the ’iDaafa, check out Chapter 7. For more on the  ﺍﻝ
’[alif laam], refer to Chapter 2.)
In this section, I show you how to use the Arabic partitives meaning all, some/part, 
and most.

258
Forming sentences with ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull; all)
To express the phrase all of the food in Arabic, you take the partitive noun ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull; 
all) and put the word ( ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡaT-Ta3aam; the food) directly after it. So the phrase 
looks like this: ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡkull aT-Ta3aam; all [of] the food).
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) can take the object suffixes (see Chapters 2 and 12) like any noun. You put 
object pronoun suffixes on this partitive when you want to express, for instance, all of 
it (as opposed to all of the pie) or all of them. Look at a few examples:
.ﺃﹶﻣﹼﺎ ﺃﹶﺻﹾﺪﹺﻗﺎﺋﻲ ﻓﹶﻜﹸﻠﱡﻬﹸﻢ ﻫﹸﻨﺎ
’(amma ’aSdiqaa’ii fa-kulluhum hunaa. As for my friends, they’re all here.)
.ﺃﹶﻛﹶﻞﹶ ﺍﻟﻮﹶﻟﹶﺪ ﺍﻟﻜﺎﺗﻮ ﻛﹸﻠﱠﻪﹸ
’(akala al-walad al-kaatuu kullahu. The boy ate the cake — all of it.)
To show you how ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull; all) works, I present the slightly different meanings it 
takes when it’s followed by a definite or indefinite noun.
Using ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) with a definite noun
When you combine ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) with a definite singular noun, the partitive can be trans-
lated as the whole. With a definite plural noun, you would translate it as all [of] the. 
Here are some phrases using the partitive ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull):
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻨﹼﺎﺱkull an-naas; all [of] the people)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻌﺎﻟﹶﻢkull al-3aalam; the whole world)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻷﹶﻳﹼﺎﻡkull al-’ayyaam; all [of] the days)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻴﹶﻮﹾﻡkull al-yawm; the whole day)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﻠﱠﻴﹾﻞkull al-layl; the whole night)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﺴﱠﻨﺔkull as-sana; the whole year)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺍﻟﺼﱠﻒﹼkull aS-Saff; the whole class)
Using ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull) with an indefinite noun
When an indefinite noun follows ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull), it means each or every. Here are several 
example phrases for you:
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡkull yawm; every day)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺷﹶﺨﹾﺺkull shakhS; each person)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺳﹶﻨﺔkull sana; every year)
( ﻛﹸﻞﹼ ﺃﹶﺣﹶﺪﹴkull aHadin; every one/each one)

 Chapter 15: Picking Up the Pieces Using Particles and Partitives 259
Creating reciprocal phrases with 
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D; some/part)
Like other partitives, ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D) — which means some or part of something — pre-
cedes the noun it describes in an ’iDaafa construction. Here are several examples to 
show you how to use ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D):
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾ ﺍﻟﻮﹶﻗﹾﺖba3D al-waqt; some of the time)
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾ ﺍﻟﻨﹼﺎﺱba3D an-naas; some of the people)
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾ ﺍﻷﹶﻳﹼﺎﻡba3D al-’ayyaam; some of the days)
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D) with a possessive suffix gives you this useful reciprocal phrase:
( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﻀﹸﻬﹸﻢ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﻀﺎﹰba3Duhum ba3Dan; one another/each other)
What’s a reciprocal phrase, you ask? It’s a phrase in which you express action that’s 
done between two subjects. You usually translate it with each other or one another. 
With the exception of the way you translate ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D) in a reciprocal phrase, this 
partitive can always be translated as some.
Writing with ( ﻣﹸﻌﹾﻈﹶﻢmu3DHam) 
and ’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻠﹶﺐaghlab)
The Arabic words ( ﻣﹸﻌﹾﻈﹶﻢmu3DHam) and ’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻠﹶﺐaghlab) both mean most. There 
isn’t difference in meaning between them, and neither is more correct in any given 
context. The meaning stays the same regardless of the noun that follows it. Just as 
with ( ﻛﹸﻞﹼkull; all) and ( ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺾba3D; some) in the preceding sections, you use  ﻣﹸﻌﹾﻈﹶﻢ
(mu3DHam) and ’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻠﹶﺐaghlab) in an ’iDaafa with the noun you want to modify. 
Here are a few examples:
( ﻣﹸﻌﻈﹶﻢ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻌﺎﻡmu3DHam aT-Ta3aam; most [of] the food)
’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻠﹶﺐ ﺍﻟﻄﱡﹼﻼﺏaghlab aT-Tullaab; most [of] the students)
’( ﺃﹶﻏﹾﻠﹶﺐ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺸﺎﻛﹺﻞaghlab al-mashaakil; most [of] the problems)
 
To help you practice your use of the partitive nouns visually, in this exercise I show 
you a number of objects circled in different ways. For each picture, I give you a num-
ber of phrases — only one of which expresses the reality in the picture with the 
appropriate Arabic partitive. Select the item that best matches how the objects are 
circled, and then translate the Arabic phrase into English.

Chapter 16
Uncovering the Source 
of the Verbal Noun
In This Chapter
 Getting to know verbal nouns
 Creating verbal nouns for all the forms of the Arabic verb
 Using verbal nouns in your writing
I
n English, when you write about actions as abstract or complex concepts, you’re 
using verbal nouns. For example, in the maxim, “To err is human, to forgive 
divine,” the words err and forgive are verbal nouns. They represent both abstract and 
complex actions. This is different from using a verb such as “Run!” which indicates a 
pretty simple and clear action.
 
Arabic has a system of verbal nouns that allows you to express abstract or complex 
 
concepts concisely. The Arabic word for the verbal noun is ( ﻣﹶﺼﹾﺪﹶﺭmaSdar), which 
literally means source. You can think of the verbal noun as the source or most basic 
form of any verb. In this chapter, you discover how to produce the maSdar for any 
verb that you need to use. You also encounter how to use the maSdar in several 
important sentence structures.
Understanding the Basics of Verbal Nouns
Before you can begin using the Arabic maSdar in your writing, you first need to wrap 
your brain around it. A veteran linguist at the National Security Agency once told me 
that the key to understanding the Arabic verbal noun is to view it as more verb than 
noun. The maSdar is indeed a noun in form, though; it can take all the cases of the 
noun. (For more on the cases, flip to Chapter 4). But a verbal noun in Arabic doesn’t 
just describe an action. Instead, it’s a way of expressing action. In Arabic, for 
instance, you frequently use a verbal noun where English would use a form of the 
verb called an infinitive. Like all verbs in Arabic, the verbal noun is quite varied in its 
shape in Form I, and remarkably regular in Forms II through X.
To help you understand verbal nouns from a grammatical standpoint, I start by 
describing their formations and uses in English. Verbal nouns are derived from verbs, 
and they describe the act of performing whatever their verbs mean. Grammarians use 
the term gerund in English to describe verbal nouns that end -ing. Think of the advice 

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
264
“Seeing is believing.” In this example, seeing and believing are gerunds being used as 
verbal nouns.
You can also use infinitives as verbal nouns. In English, you form the infinitive by put-
ting the preposition to in front of the most basic form of the verb. You use the infini-
tive when you want to complete the action of certain auxiliary verbs. For example, 
when you say “I want . . .” you finish your thought with an infinitive (such as “to eat a 
nice juicy steak”). Consider the infinitive’s use in the following maxim: “To err is 
human.” In this example, to err is an infinitive, but it’s representing the concept of 
erring.
 
While English uses more than one type of word as a verbal noun (such as the gerunds 
and infinitives in the previous examples), an Arabic verb has one verbal noun but can 
use that one verbal noun as both a gerund and even as an infinitive. Each of the ten 
Arabic verb forms has its own verbal noun, but you can think of them as verbal nouns 
of different verbs, even though they’re derived from the same verbal root.
Grammatically, a verbal noun is a noun. You use it in both English and Arabic the 
same way you use other more concrete nouns. Here’s an example of the same verb 
expressed once with a tangible object and then with a verbal noun as its object:
I like stuffed grape leaves.
I like eating in Arab restaurants.
I underline the direct objects of the verb in the previous examples. In the first exam-
ple, the verb, like, has as its direct object a tangible (and delicious) concrete thing — 
stuffed grape leaves. In the second example, however, the object of the verb is an 
action that I like doing. The two sentences are identical in their deep grammatical 
structures (each one having a verb and a direct object). But they’re quite different in 
that the second example shows the versatility of using a verbal noun to express suc-
cinctly what could have been a much more complex sentence if done verbally (for 
example, I like it when I eat in Arab restaurants).
Producing the maSdar in the Forms
 
Producing a maSdar is easy. All you need to know is the word pattern used by the 
particular verbal root in Form I or the regular word pattern used by each of the other 
verb forms. You can then simply substitute the consonants of your verbal root for the 
consonants in the dummy root ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l). (To discover more about this root to pro-
duce word patterns, visit Chapter 2.) Here are several examples of this substitution:

 Chapter 16: Uncovering the Source of the Verbal Noun 265
After you see how to align the consonants one by one with the location within the 
word pattern of the dummy root ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l), you can take any supplied pattern and 
produce the maSdar. Notice how the consonants in each verbal root replace the con-
sonants of the dummy root ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l) to produce a word that essentially rhymes 
with the pattern.
The Arabic verb comes in ten forms. Each one of them has its own maSdar to master. 
The Arabic verb is also subject to various irregularities depending on the relative 
strength or weakness of the consonants in each verbal root. In this section, you 
encounter everything you need to know to produce the maSdar, not only of the regu-
lar verb in all ten forms, but also of the irregular verb.
Creating the maSdar of regular verbs
To succeed with the maSdar of the regular verb, all you need to know is the principle 
of substituting consonants within the word patterns with the dummy root. The 
maSdar almost always preserves the distinct elements you use to recognize the 
form of the verb. (For more on the ten forms of the Arabic verb, go to Chapter 9.)
Form I
The maSdar of Form I verbs is unpredictable. I know it’s frustrating to have to memo-
rize random patterns for these verbs. But do know that the rest of the forms are com-
pletely regular and predictable.
 
No single word pattern is reserved for the Form I maSdar. Arabic uses an enormous 
variety of word patterns to produce it. And unfortunately, from a verbal root alone, 
you can’t infallibly predict what shape that root’s Form I maSdar will take. As a result, 
you ultimately have to memorize the maSdar of the basic and important verbs in 
Form I. To show you the possibilities, here are several Form I verbal nouns of some 
basic and important verbs:
( ﺫﹶﻫﺎﺏdhahaab; to go)
( ﺩﹸﺧﻮﻝdukhuul; to enter)
( ﻋﹶﻤﹶﻞ3amal; to work)
( ﺩﹺﺭﺍﺳﺔdiraasa; to study)
Forms II–X
The maSdar in Forms II–X are regular and a little easier to master than Form I. In 
Table 16-1, I present the maSdar for some verbs in Forms II–X. In the “Pattern” col-
umn, I provide the word pattern that you use to produce each form’s maSdar. The 
present tense is provided as a reference to remind you about the distinct features 
you find in each of the ten verb forms. Now, you can’t exactly extrapolate the maSdar 
from any particular part of the verb. Instead, you need to memorize the word pat-
terns for each of the ten forms.

Creating the maSdar of irregular verbs
Arabic verbs are considered irregular if one or more of the three consonants of the verbal 
root are weak enough in pronunciation that they affect the form of the verb. When you pro-
duce the maSdar with a root containing a weak letter, you still use the same word patterns 
as the regular verb. You just have to make a few adjustments because of the weak letters.
Form I
Just as with regular verbs, the irregular Form I maSdar is unpredictable and has to be 
memorized separately. A dictionary can give you this information.
Here are the maSdar forms of several important irregular verbs in Form I:
( ﻛﹶﻮﹾﻥkawn; to be)
( ﻭﹸﺻﻮﻝwuSuul; to arrive)
( ﺑﹶﻴﹾﻊbay3; to sell)
( ﺷﹺﺮﺍﺀshiraa’; to buy)

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
268
 
In many cases, verbs that are irregular in their present or past tenses are completely 
regular in their maSdar forms. Geminate verbs, for instance, split up the doubled let-
ter to produce a regular maSdar. Here are examples of geminate verbs with the let-
ters doubled in the past tense and split up in the maSdar:
( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹶﻤﹶﺮﱠistamarra; he continued)
( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﹺﻤﹾﺮﺍﺭistimraar; to continue)
You can read more about geminate verbs in Chapter 10.
Initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs (Forms VIII, IV and X)
The maSdar of a verb with an initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) isn’t terribly difficult to 
spot. Initial waaw or yaa’ verbs keep the assimilation that they ordinarily have in 
Form VIII. However, in Forms IV and X, they turn their initial consonant into a long i 
vowel, which is written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’). Here are some examples:
Form 
Verbal Root 
Present 
maSdar 
English
VIII ( ﻭﺻﻞw-S-l) ( ﻳﹶﺘﹾﹶﺼﹺﻞﹸyattaSilu) ( ﺍﹺﺗﱢﺼﺎﻝittiSaal)

IV ( ﻭﺟﺐw-j-b) ( ﻳﻮﺟﹺﺐﹸyuujibu) ’( ﺇﻳﺠﺎﺏiijaab)

X ( ﻭﺭﺩw-r-d) ( ﻳﹶﺴﹾﺘﹶﻮﹾﺭﹺﺩﹸyastawridu) ( ﺍﹺﺳﹾﺘﻴﺮﺍﺩistiiraad) 
to import
Note the doubled ( ﺗﺎﺀtaa’), which is the distinctive feature of an initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) 
verb in Form VIII. The long i vowel — written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) — in the Form IV and X 
maSdar of an initial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) verb can take some getting used to. Remember that 
the ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) and the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) behave similarly in the irregular verbs, so it’s no sur-
prise that a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) turns into a ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’).
Medial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs (Forms IV and X)
Medial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs in Forms IV and X turn the medial letter into a 
long a vowel (written with an ’[ ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif]) and add a ( ﺗﺎﺀ ﻣﹶﺮﹾﺑﻮﻃﹶﺔtaa’ marbuuTa). 
Check out a few examples:

Arabic likes its roots to have three consonants. When the weakness of a consonant 
makes it disappear, as you see it do by turning into a long a vowel in the previous 
 
table, the language compensates by adding something. The ( ﺗﺎﺀﻣﹶﺮﹾﺑﻮﻃﹶﺔtaa’ marb-
uTa) gives the maSdar here an extra syllable to make up for the lost letter.
Final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs (Forms II and III)
Final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs add a ( ﺗﺎﺀ ﻣﹶﺮﹾﺑﻮﻃﹶﺔtaa’ marbuuTa) in Forms II and 
III as shown in these examples:

III ( ﻧﺪﻭn-d-w) ( ﻳﹸﻨﺎﺩﻱyunaadii) ( ﻣﹸﻨﺎﺩﺍﺓmunaadaa) to call out
The key to recognizing the maSdar of a final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verb in Forms II 
and III is to note that most of the normal shape of the maSdar is still present with 
them. Just be careful not to mistake the form ( ﺗﹶﺮﹾﺑﹺﻴﺔtarbiya) for a feminine adjective 
(for more information on adjectives, check out Chapter 6).
Final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs (Forms IV, VII, VIII and X)
In Forms IV, VII, VIII, and X, final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs turn the final letter into 
a long a — written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — followed by ( ﺀhamza). Check out these examples:

As you can see in the previous examples, the final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is replaced 
by the distinctly recognizable long a and ( ﺀhamza). The key to finding a word in a 
dictionary is knowing what root it comes from. If you ever run across such a form in 
your reading, it’s a good bet that a final long a and ( ﺀhamza) are hiding a final  ﻭﺍﻭ
(waaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’).
Final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs (Forms V and VI)
In Forms V and VI, final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs remove the final letter 
altogether and replace it with ( ﻛﹶﺴﹾﺮﹶﺗﹶﻴﹾﻦkasratayn). The kasratayn turns into a full 
long i vowel — written with ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) — when the maSdar is the head of an ’iDaafa or 
has the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). Here are two examples:

To help you note the alternate forms, I’ve placed the Form V and VI final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) 
or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) maSdar directly below the form with kasratayn. The version with the 
final long vowel is the one you will actually see more commonly, because the maSdar 
will tend to take on the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam) in actual use. (To see more about adding the  ﺍﻝ
’[alif laam] to the maSdar, continue to the next section, “Incorporating the maSdar in 
Your Writing.”)

Incorporating the maSdar in Your Writing
The Arabic maSdar is a powerful tool for expressing yourself succinctly. In this sec-
tion, I show you ways to use a maSdar as a noun, describing actions vividly in the 
three cases. I also show you ways to replace longer verbal clauses with a maSdar. 
Finally, you discover how to coordinate the use of your maSdar with important auxil-
iary verbs, which shows you can express a polished literary style.
Using the maSdar as a noun
Like in English, every verbal noun in Arabic can be used as a noun that describes an 
action rather than a physical object. In fact, as a noun, a maSdar can appear in any 
place you might use another noun. In other words, it can be used in all three cases: 
nominative, accusative, and genitive. The verbal noun sometimes denotes a concept 
only translatable as a noun. Other times, the verbal noun could be replaced with a 
form of a verb to create a sentence of the same meaning. I explain how to use a maS-
dar with all three cases in the following sections.
The maSdar as a nominative noun
A maSdar in the nominative case can be the subject of a nominal sentence or the sub-
ject of a verb. A maSdar with a ( ﺗﺎﺀ ﻣﹶﺮﹾﺑﻮﻃﹶﺔtaa’ marbuuTa) is treated as a feminine 
noun. A verbal noun in Arabic is usually in the definite state, meaning it has the  ﺍﻝ
’(alif laam) prefix (the equivalent of the English word the). (To see how to add the  ﺍﻝ
’[alif laam] to nouns, flip to Chapter 2.) In other words, unless the verbal noun is the 
first member of an ’iDaafa, it either has the ’( ﺍﻝalif laam) or a possessive suffix.
Here’s an example of the maSdar being used in the nominative case (the maSdar is 
underlined):
.ﺍﻟﺪﱢﺭﺍﺳﺔﹸ ﻛﹸﻞﱠ ﻳﹶﻮﹾﻡﹴ ﻣﹸﻬﹺﻤﹼﺔﹲ
(ad-diraasatu kulla yawmin muhimmatun. Studying every day is important.)
The maSdar as an accusative object noun
Just as a verbal noun can be the subject of a verb, it can also be the object, which 
means it’s in the accusative case. Here are two examples of verbal nouns in the accu-
sative case and serving as objects to verbs (the maSdar is underlined):
.ﺃﹸﺣﹺﺐﱡ ﺍﻷﹶﻛﹾﻞ ﻓﻲ ﻣﹶﻄﺎﻋﹺﻢ ﻋﹶﺮﹶﺑﹺﻴﹼﺔ
’(uHibbu al-’akl fii maTaa3im 3arabiyya. I love eating in Arab restaurants.)
.ﺑﹶﺪﹶﺃﹶﺕﹾ ﺯﹺﻳﺎﺭﹶﺗﹶﻬﺎ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺘﹾﺤﹶﻒ
(bada’at ziyaaratahaa fii-l-matHafi. She began her visit at the museum.)
Notice that in the first example, the English gerund would be interchangeable with 
the infinitive to eat. In that example, the verbal noun is functioning as a verbal com-
plement within the sentence. In the other example, the verbal noun is rendered much 
more as a noun. This displays the versatility of verbal nouns in Arabic.

 Chapter 16: Uncovering the Source of the Verbal Noun 271
The maSdar as a genitive noun
A verbal noun can appear in the genitive case after prepositions or as the second 
member of an ’iDaafa. Here are two examples of verbal nouns in the genitive case 
(the maSdar is underlined):
.ﻛﺎﻧﹶﺖﹾ ﻧﹶﺘﻴﺠﹶﺔ ﻋﹶﻤﹶﻠﹺﻬﺎ ﻣﹸﺆﹶﺛﱢﺮﺓ
(kaanat natiijat-3amaliha mu’aththiratan. The result of her work was impressive.)
.ﻧﺎﻡﹶ ﺟﹶﻴﱢﺪﺍﹰ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶ ﻋﹶﻮﹾﺩﹶﺗﹺﻪﹺ ﻣﹺﻦ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺣﹾﻠﺔ
(naama jayyidan ba3da 3awdatihi min ar-riHlati. He slept well after his return 
from the trip.)
Notice that in the second example, another perfectly good translation would be to 
render the verbal noun as a verbal phrase: He slept well after he returned from the trip.
 
As long as you understand what the Arabic is actually doing on a grammatical level, 
you should feel free to translate more freely than a literal word for word rendering.
Creating purpose clauses with the maSdar
The maSdar gives you a convenient way to express a purpose clause (a clause that 
describes the reason or intention for doing something) that would otherwise require 
a longer sentence. You can add the preposition ( ﻟﹺli-; to) to a maSdar and use it as an 
infinitive. This maSdar can stand in the place of a longer clause formed using the sub-
junctive. Here are a few examples:
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ ﻟﹺﻜﹶﻲﹾ ﺃﹶﺩﹾﺭﹸﺱﹶ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ
(dhahabtu ’ila miSr likay ’adrusa hunaaka. I went to Egypt in order that I might 
study there.)
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ ﻟﹺﻠﺪﱢﺭﺍﺳﺔ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ
(dhahabtu ’ila miSr lid-diraasati hunaaka. I went to Egypt to study there.)
In the previous examples, it only takes one less syllable to use the maSdar in the pur-
pose clause. Even so, learning to use the maSdar instead of the subjunctive is an effi-
cient way to write. After all, there may be times when you won’t know the subjunctive 
form of an irregular verb. The maSdar will likely be easier to remember.
 
Sometimes, you may want to form a purpose clause with an object. In this case, you 
can add an object to your purpose clause by putting your maSdar in an ’iDaafa with 
the intended object. (See Chapter 7 for more on the ’iDaafa.) Consider this literal 
translation of an ’iDaafa added to the earlier example:
.ﺫﹶﻫﹶﺒﹾﺖﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ ﻟﹺﺪﹺﺭﺍﺳﺔ ﺍﻟﻌﹶﺮﹶﺑﹺﻴﹼﺔ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ
(dhahabtu ’ila miSr li-diraasat-al-3arabiyya hunaaka. I went to Egypt for the 
study of Arabic there.)

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
272
The “study of Arabic” is essentially the same thing as “studying Arabic.” Here are 
some other examples of purpose clauses with ’iDaafas as objects:
.ﺩﹶﺧﹶﻠﹶﺖﹾ ﺍﻟﻐﹸﺮﹾﻓﺔ ﻟﹺﺘﹶﺒﹾﻠﻴﻎﹺ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲ ﻋﹶﻦ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻜﺎﻟﹶﻤﺔ
(dakhalat al-ghurfata litabliighi-r-ra’iisi 3an al-mukaalama. She entered the 
room to inform the president about the call.)
.ﻳﹶﺠﹺﺐﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺗﹶﻜﹾﺘﹸﺐﹶ ﺭﹺﺳﺎﻟﺔﹰ ﻟﹺﻮﺍﻟﹺﺪﹶﻳﹾﻚﹶ ﻟﹺﺘﹶﻬﹾﺪﹺﺋﺔ ﺃﻋﹾﺼﺎﺑﹺﻬﹺﻤﺎ
(yajibu ’an taktuba risaalatan li-waalidayka li-tahdi’ati a3Saabihimaa. You 
should write a letter to your parents in order to calm their nerves.)
Making use of the maSdar 
with an auxiliary verb
A feature especially common in Arabic media is the use of the maSdar with certain 
auxiliary verbs. They’re common in newspapers because they provide a way to con-
cisely express certain constructions. In this section, I show you one auxiliary verb 
that is so pervasively used in literary Arabic that knowing it is essential as you 
begin to read and write at the intermediate level. The auxiliary verb you want to 
know is ( ﻗﺎﻡﹶ ﺑqaama bi; to rise).
The verb ( ﻗﺎﻡﹶqaama) means to rise. This verb can have numerous idiomatic uses, 
especially when you add a prepositional phrase to it. When you follow the verb  ﻗﺎﻡﹶ
(qaama) with the preposition ( ﺑﹺbi-; with, by) plus maSdar, it denotes the concept of 
performing or undertaking an action. In many cases, it isn’t even necessary to add the 
sense of performing or undertaking to your translation. You can just translate the 
maSdar as if it were the main verb of the sentence.
Here are a few examples of ( ﻗﺎﻡﹶ ﺑﹺqaama bi-) with a maSdar:
.ﻗﺎﻡﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺋﻴﺲ ﺑﹺﺘﹶﻮﹾﻗﻴﻊ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﻌﺎﻫﺪﺓ
(qaama ar-ra’iis bi-tawqii3i-l-mu3aahada. The president signed the treaty.)
.ﻗﺎﻣﻮﺍ ﺑﹺﺎﻟﺒﹶﺤﹾﺚ ﻋﹶﻦ ﺍﻟﺬﱠﻫﹶﺐ
(qaamuu bi-l-baHthi 3an adh-dhahabi. They undertook to search for the gold.)
Remember that the maSdar is the real verb of the sentence when it’s used with the 
auxiliary verbs. In the first example, I don’t translate the auxiliary at all, because it 
isn’t necessary. In the second example, I render it with the verb to undertake; though 
They searched for the gold would be a valid translation.
 
Almost all of the following sentences use one or more examples of the maSdar. See if 
you can arrange the sentences into the order that best makes a coherent story. To do 

 Chapter 16: Uncovering the Source of the Verbal Noun 273
so, first write the English translation below each sentence, and then write the letters 
of each sentence in the correct order to make a story in the space provided.

Being Positive About Adding the 
Negative to Arabic Sentences
In This Chapter
 Adding the negative to sentences of all tenses
 Negating nouns and adjectives
I
f you ask your boss for a raise, you’re hoping, of course, to hear the word yes. And 
if you call that special someone for a date, you’d like to hear an enthusiastic sure! 
What you don’t want to hear is that one dreaded word: no. Negative sentences have 
received a bad rap because they so often stand in the way of what you want in life. 
But negative sentences can be positive. Perhaps your boss says, “I’ve been thinking 
you don’t make enough money here.” Or, maybe your sweetheart says to you, 
“There’s no one else in the world I’d rather go out with.”
However you look at it, adding no or not to a sentence is important. In this chapter, 
you discover that Arabic adds no or not in a number of ways. In the first part of the 
chapter, you see that you need to use different words for no and not and different 
moods of the verb, depending on whether you want to negate past, present, or future 
tenses. In the second half of the chapter, you experience the different ways nouns 
and adjectives are negated. I can’t guarantee you’ll always hear the answer you hope 
for in life, but I’ll at least try to make your experience of the negative in Arabic a posi-
tive one.
Putting a Negative Spin on Verbs
Telling your readers that something didn’t happen is at least as valuable as being able 
to report what did. In English, you add the word not, usually directly in front of your 
verb, and you’ve done the job. Arabic, however, offers you a few more techniques. In 
this section, I show you how to negate in the past, present, and future tenses as well 
as how to negate commands.
 
Before you begin encountering the ways you add not to verbs, make sure you’re com-
fortable with the jussive and subjunctive forms of the verb. (I explain them in consid-
erable detail in Chapter 13.)

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
278
Don’t do it! Writing the negative command
 
Unlike in English, in Arabic you can’t tell someone not to do something just by putting 
the word not with the command. Instead, you have to put the word ( ﻻlaa) in front of 
the second person jussive forms.
Here are some examples of negative commands:
!ﻻ ﺗﹶﻘﻮﻟﻲ ﺫﻟﹺﻚﹶ
(laa taquulii dhaalika! Don’t say that!)
.ﻻ ﺗﹶﻤﹾﺶﹺ ﺇﹺﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺪﹾﺭﹶﺳﺔ ﺇﹺﺫﺍ ﻛﹸﻨﹾﺖﹶ ﻣﹶﺮﻳﻀﺎﹰ
(laa tamshi ’ilaa-l-madrasa ’idha kunta mariiDan. Don’t go to school if 
you’re sick.)
!ﻻ ﺗﹶﻨﹾﺲﹶ ﻋﻴﺪ ﻣﻴﻼﺩﻱ
(laa tansa 3iid milaadii! Don’t forget my birthday!)
!ﻻ ﺗﹶﺘﹶﺄﹶﺧﱠﺮﻭﺍ
(laa tata’akhkharuu! Don’t be late!)
The way it wasn’t: Negating the past tense
The past tense is the only timeframe in which Arabic gives you two options for adding 
not to your sentence. In each case, you put the word that means not directly in front 
of the verb form required by the negative.
Putting ( ﻣﺎmaa) before a past tense verb
The first and easiest way to negate a past tense verb is to put the word ( ﻣﺎmaa; not) 
before your verb. Here are several examples of ( ﻣﺎmaa) plus a past tense verb:
.ﻣﺎ ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺟﺎﺋﹺﻌﺎﹰ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﹾﻌﹶﻢ
(maa kaana jaa’i3an 3indamaa waSala ’ilaa-l-mat3am. He was not hungry when 
he arrived at the restaurant.)
.ﻣﺎ ﺷﹶﺮﹺﺑﹾﺖﹸ ﺍﻟﻘﹶﻬﹾﻮﺓ ﻷﹶﻧﹼﻲ ﺃﹸﻓﹶﻀﱢﻞﹸ ﺍﻟﺸﹼﺎﻱ
(maa sharibtu al-qahwa li’anni ’ufaDDilu al-shaay. I did not drink the coffee 
because I prefer tea.)
.ﻣﺎ ﺳﺎﻓﹶﺮﻭﺍ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻷﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻥ ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﹺﻬﹺﻢﹾ
(maa saafaruu ’ilaa-l-’urdun ma3a jaddatihim. They did not travel to Jordan with 
their grandmother.)
The handy thing about using ( ﻣﺎmaa) plus the past tense verb is that this option 
allows you to just add one word to a fairly basic form of the verb. Because you 

 Chapter 17: Being Positive About Adding the Negative to Arabic Sentences 279
probably picked up the past tense early in your Arabic studies, negating it with this 
method is easy enough.
Negating with ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam) plus the jussive mood
The other way to negate the past tense involves using a form of the verb you proba-
bly didn’t encounter until later in your Arabic studies: the jussive (see Chapter 13 if 
you need a refresher). If you put the word ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam; not) directly in front of a jussive 
verb, you can translate the sentence just as if it were a past tense verb with ( ﻣﺎmaa), 
which I discuss in the previous section.
 
The jussive on its own isn’t a past tense verb. Only when you put ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam) in front of 
the jussive does it take on a past tense meaning.
Here are some examples that use ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam) plus the jussive. (Note: I use the same 
examples in the preceding section to show you the past tense with [ ﻣﺎmaa]. Notice 
that the translation is identical).
.ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﻜﹸﻦﹾ ﺟﺎﺋﹺﻌﺎﹰ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻣﺎ ﻭﹶﺻﹶﻞﹶ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﹾﻌﹶﻢ
(lam yakun jaa’i3an 3indamaa waSalam ’ilaa-l-mat3am. He was not hungry when 
he arrived at the restaurant.)
.ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹸﺴﺎﻓﹺﺮﻭﺍ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻷﹸﺭﹾﺩﹸﻥ ﻣﹶﻊﹶ ﺟﹶﺪﱠﺗﹺﻬﹺﻢﹾ
(lam yusaafiruu ’ilaa-l-’urdun ma3a jaddatihim. They did not travel to Jordan 
with their grandmother.)
Adding ( ﻣﺎmaa) to negate a past tense verb is a bit less formal than using ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam) 
plus the jussive mood. However, ( ﻣﺎmaa) isn’t colloquial Arabic. You’re likely to 
encounter both these methods, and you should know how to produce both equally 
well.
 
Putting the word ( ﻣﺎmaa) in front of a past tense verb doesn’t involve much of a chal-
lenge. The more valuable skill is turning a past tense verb into a negative with the jus-
 
sive option. For each of the past tense verbs I give you here, add ( ﻟﹶﻢﹾlam) and 
replace the past tense verb with the corresponding jussive form. You’ll find one prac-
tice problem that’s already negative with ( ﻣﺎmaa). In that case, replace the ( ﻣﺎmaa) 
accordingly.

Not happening: Negating the present tense
Negating the present tense isn’t difficult. I just did it in English! Luckily, it’s just as 
easy in Arabic. All you have to do is add the word for not and you’re in business. And 
because Arabic doesn’t even have a present tense of the most basic verb of all, to be, 
you get a special verb just for when you need to say, to not be.
Using ( ﻻlaa) with most verbs
When you’re dealing with the present timeframe and need to add the word not, you 
need only place the word ( ﻻlaa) in front of your verb. Here are two examples of 
negated present tense verbs:
.ﻻ ﻳﹸﺮﻳﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﻳﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺐﹶ ﻣﹶﻌﹶﻨﺎ ﻷﹶﻧﱠﻪﹸ ﻣﹶﺮﻳﺾ
(laa yuriidu ’an yadh-haba ma3ana li’annahu mariiD. He does not want to go 
with us because he’s sick.)
.ﻻ ﺃﹶﺳﹾﻜﹸﻦﹸ ﻓﻲ ﺑﹶﻴﹾﺖﹴ ﺑﹶﻞﹾ ﻓﻲ ﺷﹶﻘﱠﺔﹴ
(laa ’askunu fii baytin bal fii shaqqatin. I do not live in a house, but rather an 
apartment.)
Not having or being: Applying ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa)
Because Arabic has no present tense form of the verb to be, you use a special negative par-
ticle ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) to express concepts such as he is not . . . . (See Chapter 15 for more on 
particles.) The curious thing about ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) is that although you use it as a negative 
form of the present tense, it has past tense endings on it. Like the verb ( ﻛﺎﻥﹶkaana; to be), 
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) uses the accusative case in the predicate. Check out the verb table for the con-
jugation of this word.
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa; not to be)
’( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺖﹸanaa lastu)( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﻨﺎnaHnu lasna)
’( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺖﹶanta lasta)
’( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺖﹺanti lasti)
’( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺘﹸﻢﹾantum lastum)
’( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺘﹸﻦﱠantunna lastunna)
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶhuwa laysa)
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺴﹶﺖﹾhiya laysat)
( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺴﻮﺍhum laysuu)
( ﻟﹶﺴﹾﻦﹶhunna lasna)
.ﻟﹶﺴﹾﺖﹸ ﻋﹶﻄﹾﺸﺎﻥ ﺍﻵﻥ
(lastu 3aTshaan al’aan. I’m not thirsty right now.)

 Chapter 17: Being Positive About Adding the Negative to Arabic Sentences 281
Here are a couple of examples of using ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) to negate to be:
.ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﺍﻟﻔﻴﻠﻢ ﺟﹶﻴﱢﺪﺍﹰ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ
(laysa-l-film jayyidan jiddan. The movie is not very good.)
.ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﺪﹾﺭﹸﺱﹾ ﺍﻟﻄﱡﹼﻼﺏ ﻓﹶﻠﹶﻴﹾﺴﻮﺍ ﻣﹸﺴﹾﺘﹶﻌﹺﺪﹼﻳﻦﹶ ﻟﻼﻣﹾﺘﹺﺤﺎﻥ
(lam yadrusu aT-Tullaab, fa-laysuu musta3iddiin li-limtiHaan. The students 
didn’t study, so they’re not prepared for the test.)
You can also use ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) in the sense of there isn’t [something]:
.ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ ﺷﹶﻲﹾﺀﹲ ﻋﹶﻠﻰ ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﻭﹺﻟﺔ
(laysa hunaaka ’shay’un 3alaa-Taawila. There is not anything on the table.)
The word ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa) is also useful for negating ( ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶ3inda; to have). Consider these 
examples:
.ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﻱ ﻣﹸﺸﹾﻜﹺﻠﺔ
(laysa 3indii muskila. I have no problem.)
.ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻋﹺﻨﹾﺪﹶﻧﺎ ﺍﻟﻮﹶﻗﹾﺖ ﺍﻵﻥ
(laysa 3indana al-waqt al’aan. We do not have the time right now.)
Not meant to be: Negating the future tense
To add the word not in the future tense, you need to use a special word for not:  ﻟﹶﻦﹾ
(lan). You put it directly in front of the subjunctive form of the verb. (Refer to 
Chapter 13 for more on the subjunctive.) Here are some examples of sentences with 
future tense followed by a sentence with negated verbs in the subjunctive mood:
.( ﺳﹶﺄﹸﺭﹾﺳﹺﻞﹸ ﻟﹶﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺳﺎﻟﺔsa’ursilu laka ar-risaala. I will send you the letter.)
.( ﻟﹶﻦﹾ ﺃﹸﺭﹾﺳﹺﻞﹶ ﻟﹶﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺳﺎﻟﺔlan ’ursila lahu ar-risaala. I will not send you the letter.)
.( ﺳﹶﻴﹶﺼﹺﻠﻮﻥﹶ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﺎﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺘﹼﺎﺳﹺﻌﺔsa-yaSiluuna ’ilaa-l-maTaar 
fii-s-saa3a at-taasi3a. They will arrive at the airport at nine o’clock.)
.( ﻟﹶﻦﹾ ﻳﹶﺼﹺﻠﻮﺍ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﻄﺎﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﹼﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﺘﹼﺎﺳﹺﻌﺔlan yaSiluu ’ilaa-l-maTaar fii-s-saa3a
 at-taasi3a. They will not arrive at the airport at nine o’clock.)
 
The following sentences contain no negatives. Change each one into its negative equiv-
alent. If you have a present tense verb, all you need to do is put ( ﻻlaa) before the verb. 
 
If it’s a present tense nominal sentence, you need to add a form of ( ﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶlaysa). (For 
more on nominal sentences, see Chapter 2.) If the verb has a future tense, you need to 
 
add ( ﻟﹶﻦﹾlan) and change the verb into the subjunctive. Good luck!

Turning Nouns and Adjectives Negative
It isn’t only verbs that get negated in a language. In English, for instance, we have the 
sayings “No man is an island,” “Hell hath no fury,” and “there’s no crying in baseball” 
(unless you’re like me, a Cubs fan), which negate nouns and gerunds. In Arabic, you 
also can add a negative thought to things besides verbs. With an assortment of nega-
tive particles, you’ll be able to make nouns and adjectives negative.
Making simple nouns negative with ( ﻻlaa)
Put the ordinary negative particle ( ﻻlaa) in front of nouns when you’re forming a sen-
tence that speaks of an exception. Here’s an example to illustrate this somewhat for-
mal construction:
.ﻻ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻖﹶ ﻟﻲ ﺇﹼﻻ ﻣﹸﺼﹾﻄﹶﻔﻰ
(laa Sadiiqa lii ’illaa muSTafaa. I have no friend except Mustafa.)

 Chapter 17: Being Positive About Adding the Negative to Arabic Sentences 283
The use of ( ﻻlaa) before a noun produces a few other useful words and phrases, 
such as the following:
( ﻻ ﺷﹶﻚﱠlaa shakka; no doubt)
( ﻻ ﺑﹸﺪﹼﹶlaa budda; it’s inevitable [that])
Understanding how to negate verbal nouns
Verbal nouns are nouns that describe an action in abstract terms. They’re frequently 
in the form of a gerund, such as seeing is believing. They can also be nouns, such as 
agreement and composition (see Chapter 16).
 
When you need to add a negative to the phrase you’re expressing with the verbal 
 
noun, you use the special word ( ﻋﹶﺪﹶﻡ3adam). All on its own, this word would be 
translated as nothingness or nonexistence. When you put a verbal noun in an ’iDaafa 
 
with ( ﻋﹶﺪﹶﻡ3adam), you essentially express the nonexistence of that verbal noun’s 
action. (Flip to Chapter 7 for more on the ’iDaafa construction.)
Take a look at a couple examples of verbal nouns negated with ( ﻋﹶﺪﹶﻡ3adam):
.ﻳﹶﻌﹾﺘﹶﺬﹺﺭﹸ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪ ﻋﹶﻦﹾ ﻋﹶﺪﹶﻡ ﺩﹺﺭﺍﺳﹶﺘﹺﻪﹺ ﻓﻲ ﻣﹺﺼﹾﺮ
(ya3tadhiru ’aHmad 3an 3adam diraasatihi fii miSr. Ahmad apologizes for not 
studying in Egypt.)
.ﺷﹶﺮﹶﺣﹾﺖﹸ ﻷﹺﹸﻣﹼﻲ ﺳﹶﺒﹶﺐﹶ ﻋﹶﺪﹶﻡ ﺯﹺﻳﺎﺭﹶﺗﻲ ﺍﻷﹸﺳﹾﺒﻮﻉ ﺍﻟﻤﺎﺿﻲ
(sharaHtu li-ummii sababa 3adam ziyaaratii al’usbuu3 al-maaDii. I explained to

In English, you can turn an adjective into a negative by adding a prefix such as un-, as 
in changing acceptable to unacceptable. You can also use non- in certain cases, as in 
binding and nonbinding. In Arabic, however, you negate an adjective by putting it in an 
 
’iDaafa with the word ( ﻏﹶﻴﹾﺮghayr).
Here are some examples of adjectives negated with ( ﻏﹶﻴﹾﺮghayr):
.ﻫﺬﺍ ﻏﹶﻴﹾﺮ ﺻﹶﺤﻴﺢ
(haadha ghayr SaHiiH. That’s untrue.)
.ﺃﹶﻧﺎ ﻏﹶﻴﹾﺮ ﻣﹸﺴﹾﺘﹶﻌﹺﺪﹼ
’(anaa ghayr musta3idd. I’m unprepared.)
.ﻓﹶﺮﹶﺣﹸﻬﺎ ﻏﹶﻴﹾﺮ ﻣﹶﺤﹾﺪﻭﺩ
(faraHuhaa ghayr maHduud. Her joy is unbounded.)

Active and Passive Participles
In This Chapter
 Forming active and passive participles for regular and irregular verbs
 Understanding how to use participles in your writing
H
ave you ever been the recipient of that old prank where someone calls you, 
pretending to be from the electrical company, and asks if your refrigerator is 
running? You answer, “Why, yes it is!” The caller then responds, “Well, you better 
go catch it!” The joke hinges on ambiguity in English over the use of participles.
In this chapter, you discover everything you need to know about using participles in 
Arabic. One thing you see is that Arabic participles don’t have any of the ambiguity 
that the electrical joke depends on.
You may already know the endings you put on the Arabic participles. Participles take 
that series of endings called the sound plurals. They’re called sound plurals because 
they’re regular and predictable (as in the phrase safe and sound). After you master a 
few simple steps, you’ll be producing Arabic active and passive participles for every 
one of the ten verb forms.
In this chapter, you also encounter the ways you use participles in your Arabic writ-
ing. Forming active and passive participles accurately and using them correctly is a 
valuable skill because it allows you to dramatically expand your ability to describe 
the world around you.
Acting or Acted Upon: Comparing Active 
and Passive Participles
A convenient definition of a participle is that it’s a version of a verb that functions as 
an adjective. You can use to eat as a verb in the present tense to say John eats too fast. 
You can use it in the past tense to say Yesterday I ate too much. And you can use it in 
the future tense to say We’ll eat at a great restaurant tonight. But a participle lets you 
take that same verb and make it describe not the action itself but someone or some-
thing doing that action. An active participle describes someone currently doing that 
action. A passive participle describes something an action has been done upon.
In English, you form all active participles with the suffix -ing. With a participle you can 
write, “Eating his meal, John noticed a fly in his soup.” Or, “In the corner of the restaurant, 

Part IV: Enlivening Your Writing with Particles 
288
he saw two people kissing.” In both of these cases, the participle is really an adjective. 
Passive participles take the same action and describe someone as having experienced 
that action. With passive participles you can talk about taking home the rest of your 
half-eaten meal. You can also ask the waiter whether the tip is included.
 
English and Arabic share the fact that their participles are used as adjectives. Arabic, 
however, has separate versions of the participle depending on whether the participle 
is describing a male versus a female or one person versus a crowd. This fact isn’t sur-
prising, because Arabic distinguishes for gender and number in the rest of its adjec-
tives as well. Another key difference is that Arabic doesn’t form the participle with a 
simple ending as English does. Instead, Arabic uses the endings to mark gender and 
number. In Arabic you put the participle together by adding prefixes or changing the 
vowels, depending on the type of verb you’re using to create your participle.
Creating Forms of the Participle
Within each form, you have two kinds of participles:
 
 Active: An active participle (also called the present participle in English) 
describes an action that’s currently happening. In English, these end with -ing. 
The proverb “A rolling stone gathers no moss” shows you how the active partici-
ple is really used as an adjective.
 
 Passive: A passive participle (also called the past participle in English) describes 
an action as already completed. Consider the two passive participles in the prov-
erb “A penny saved is a penny earned.” A passive participle is a short way to say 
that an action has been accomplished on something. “A penny having been 
saved is a penny having been earned” is just unnecessarily long.
In this section, I show you how to form active and passive participles for the basic 
Form I verb, both regular and irregular. Because Forms II–X are more similar to each 
other than any of them are to Form I, I also show you the relatively easy task of form-
ing participles for regular and irregular verbs in those forms.
Producing Form I active participles 
of regular verbs
To make the active participle of a Form I regular verb, take the three consonants that 
make up your verb (the verbal root) and add the following:
 
 A long a — written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — after the first consonant of the root
 
 A (  ﹺkasra) under the second consonant
Following these two rules produces the word pattern ( ﻓﺎﻋﹺﻞfaa3il; one doing).
You use different versions of the participle when you need to use participles for the 
different genders and numbers of nouns. Here are examples of all the versions of a

sample Form I active participle showing all the endings of the participle, including the 
final vowels. Only the masculine plural has a special and different form for its accusa-
tive/genitive plural. Here’s the active participle of ( ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻞdaakhil; entering), a regular 
Form I verb:
 
Masculine (Nom.) 
Masculine (Acc./Gen.) 
Feminine
Singular ( ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻞﹲdaakhilun) 
 ( ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻠﹶﺔﹲdaakhilatun)
Plural ( ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻠﻮﻥﹶdaakhiluuna) ( ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻠﻴﻦﹶdaakhiliina) (  ﺩﺍﺧﹺﻼﺕﹸdaakhilaatu)
Producing Form I active participles 
of irregular verbs
Some weak consonants produce Form I active participles that are different from those 
of the regular verb. In the following sections, I show you a few representative forms of 
irregular participles and let you in on a few tricks to produce them.
Handling irregularities with verbs rooted in ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’)
Even in English, when you make the sounds w and y, your lips and tongue don’t com-
pletely touch anything. They’re pretty weak sounds in comparison to, say, something 
meaty like a d or a g. In Arabic, these weak consonants, the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) and the  ﻳﺎﺀ
(yaa’), tend to turn into other consonants or disappear altogether when the verb 
takes on different shapes. The Arabic verb has three consonants, and a ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) can appear in any of the three positions: first, second, or final.
If the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is the first consonant of the root, there’s no irregularity 
in Form I. Here’s an example:
( ﻭﺍﻗﹺﻒwaaqif; stopping)
If the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is the second consonant of the root, you can produce 
your Form I active participle by just turning the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) into a ( ﺀhamza).
Here are a few examples using masculine singular active participles. I transliterate the 
three consonants of the root with lowercase letters for you and separate them with 
hyphens so you can see the position of the weak letters clearly:
Participle (MS) 
Verbal Root

( ﺑﺎﺋﹺﻊbaa’i3) ( ﺑﻴﻊb-y-3) 
[one] selling; (a salesperson)
( ﻗﺎﺋﹺﻞqaa’il) ( ﻗﻮﻝq-w-l) 
[one] saying
If the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is the final consonant of the root, you can produce the 
Form I active participles by turning the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) into a final long i

vowel. The masculine singular indefinite form is written with ( ﺗﹶﻨﹾﻮﻳﻦtanwiin), but it 
becomes a long i when you add an ’( ﺍﻝalif laam). Here are a few examples:

Feminine

[one] hoping
( ﺑﺎﻙﹴbaakin) ( ﺑﺎﻛﹺﻴﺔbaakiiya) ( ﺑﻜﻲb-k-y) 
[one] weeping
Producing participles from geminate verbs
Sometimes a verb has the very same consonant in the second and final position. 
Because you essentially have twin consonants in one verb, these are called geminate 
verbs (like my zodiac sign, Gemini). You can discover more about the irregular shapes 
a geminate verb can have in Chapter 10.
To produce the active participle of a Form I geminate verb, you do the following:
 
 Insert a long a — written with ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — after the first consonant of the 
verbal root.
 
 Write the identical second and third consonants as a single doubled letter — 
 
 written with (  ﹼshadda).
Here’s an example:
Masculine 
Feminine 
Verbal Root 
English Participle
( ﻋﺎﺩﹼ3aadd) ( ﻋﺎﺩﹼﺓ3aadda) ( ﻋﺪﺩ3-d-d)

( ﻣﺎﺩﹼmaadd) ( ﻣﺎﺩﹼﺓmaadda) ( ﻣﺪﺩm-d-d) 
stretching
Producing Form I passive participles 
of regular verbs
You form the passive participle of a Form I verb with the following steps:
 
 Attach the prefix ( ﻣﹶma-) to the first consonant of the root.
 
 Add a (  ﹾsukuun) to the first consonant.
 
 Insert a long u vowel — written with ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) — after the second consonant of 
the root.
Following these rules produces the word pattern ( ﻣﹶﻔﹾﻌﻮﻝmaf3uul). Here are the 
forms of a sample Form I passive participle, ( ﻣﹶﺪﹾﺧﻮﻝmadkhuul; entered):
( ﻣﹶﺪﹾﺧﻮﻝmadkhuul, MS)
( ﻣﹶﺪﹾﺧﻮﻟﺔmadkhuula, FS)
( ﻣﹶﺪﹾﺧﻮﻟﻮﻥﹶmadkhuuluna, MP)
( ﻣﹶﺪﹾﺧﻮﻻﺕmadkhuulaat, FP)

In this practice, take the supplied verbal root and write the four versions of the active 
participle and the four versions of the passive participle (the masculine singular, the 
feminine singular, the masculine plural, and the feminine plural).

Producing Form I passive participles 
of irregular verbs
When a weak consonant is in the initial position, there are no irregularities with the 
passive participles in Form I. Here’s an example: ( ﻣﹶﻮﹾﻗﻮﻑmawquuf; stopped).
However, the irregular verbs do cause a few difficulties when you need to create Form 
I passive participles. Like the active participles, these problems occur only when the 
second or final letter is weak.
Working with the second consonant
For the passive participle of a verb that has a weak consonant in the second syllable, 
you just turn the medial consonant into a long vowel. Here are some roots and their 
masculine singular passive participles:
Passive Participle (MS)

( ﻣﹶﺒﻴﻊmabii3) ( ﺑﻴﻊb-y-3) 
selling 
( ﻣﹶﻘﻮﻝmaquul) ( ﻗﻮﻝq-w-l) 
said
Working with the final consonant
The passive participle of a final ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verb turns the final consonant into a long i 
vowel. The passive participle of a final ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) verb preserves the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw). 
Here are a couple of examples:
Masculine 
Feminine

Working with geminate verbs
The passive participles of geminate verbs have no irregularity, because the twin let-
ters are kept separate by the shape of the passive participle. Here’s an example:
( ﻣﹶﻌﹾﺪﻭﺩma3duud; counted, MS)
( ﻣﹶﻌﹾﺪﻭﺩﺓma3duuda; counted, FS)

 Chapter 18: Active and Passive Participles 293
Producing active participles for 
regular verbs in Forms II–X
After mastering the steps to create the active and passive participle for Form I verbs, 
you can produce all the rest of the Forms with just a few common rules. (If you aren’t 
familiar with the rules for producing the ten forms, see Chapter 9 before tackling the 
participles.)
 
To produce an active participle of verbs in Forms II–X, follow these steps:
 
1. Start with the third person singular present verb.
 
 For instance, start with the Form V verb ( ﻳﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹸyatakallamu; he speaks).
 
2. Remove the verbal prefix (the [ ﻳﺎﺀyaa’] and its vowel) and add the prefix 
 
 ( ﻣﹸmu-).
 
 For example, ( ﻳﹶﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹸyatakallamu) becomes ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹸmutakallamu).
 
3. In Forms V and VI, change the (  ﹶfatHa) of the second consonant to a (   ﹺkasra).
 
 For example, ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱠﻢﹸmutakallamu) becomes ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻢﹸmutakallimu).
 
4. Remove the (  ﹸDamma) from the third consonant and add the sound endings.
 
 For instance, ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻢﹸmutakallimu) becomes ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻢmutakallim),  ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻤﺔ
 
( mutakallima), ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻤﻮﻥﹶmutakallimuuna), and ( ﻣﹸﺘﹶﻜﹶﻠﱢﻤﺎﺕmutakallimaat), all 
of which mean speaking.
With just these four rules, you can produce all the active participles of Forms II–X. 
Table 18-1 shows you sample participles in Forms II–X. Because the sound endings 
are so regular, I just show you the masculine and feminine singular versions.

Producing passive participles for 
regular verbs in Forms II–X
 
The passive participles of Forms II–X are produced the same way as the active with 
one exception. Rule #3 from the previous list of steps will be the following for pas-
sive participles: Change the kasra of the second consonant of the root to a fatHa. 
(In Forms V and VI, you just leave it as it is.)
In other words, the only difference between an active and a passive participle in Forms II–X 
is the vowel of the second consonant of the root. Forms VII and IX have no passive at 
all. Table 18-2 shows sample passive participles for the forms that have a passive.

Producing active participles for 
irregular verbs in Forms II–X
Irregular verbs pose even less difficulty in Forms II–X than they do in Form I. 
Internalize just a few tricks, and you’ll be recognizing and producing them easily.
Working with weak first and second consonants
 
There are no special rules for creating active participles for verbs with weak first or 
second consonants in Forms II–X. Following the same four rules you use for regular 
verbs (see the preceding section) produces the correct forms because any irregular-
ity is already present in the third person singular present tense form you start with.

 Chapter 18: Active and Passive Participles 295
Working with a weak final consonant
As with Form I participles, when the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) is the final consonant of 
the root, you can produce the active participles by simply turning the ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) into a final long i vowel. Here’s an example:
Masculine 
Feminine 
Verbal Root 
English
( ﻣﹸﻠﹾﺘﹶﻖﹴmultaqin) ( ﻣﹸﻠﹾﺘﹶﻘﹺﻴﺔmultaqiiya) ( ﻟﻘﻲl-q-y)

( ﻣﹸﺒﹾﻚﹴmubkin) ( ﻣﹸﺒﹾﻜﹺﻴﺔmubkiya) ( ﺑﻜﻲb-k-y) 
[one] causing tears
Producing passive participles for 
irregular verbs in Forms II–X
As with the active participle, there are no special rules for generating the passive par-
ticiple of a verb with an irregularity in the first consonant. But like active participles, 
passive participles of irregular verbs present a few curious issues. In the following 
sections, I show you the peculiar cases to be on the lookout for.
Working with the second consonant
To produce the passive participles of medial ( ﻭﺍﻭwaaw) or ( ﻳﺎﺀyaa’) verbs in the 
other forms, just put a long a vowel — written with an ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif) — in the place of 
the medial letter. The following are a few examples using masculine singular passive 
participles. (Note: The passive participles of abstract concepts will sometimes look 
more like adjectives than participles.)

final ’( ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒ ﻣﹶﻜﹾﺴﻮﺭﹶﺓalif maksuura) in the masculine and a long a (written with an 
’[ ﺃﹶﻟﹺﻒalif]) in the feminine. Here’s an example:

Writing with Participles
To get a good grasp of how to use participles, you need to keep in mind exactly what 
they are. A participle is a verb that’s given the endings of an adjective. As such, parti-
ciples don’t describe the action itself. Instead, a participle is primarily describing a 
noun in terms of an action that the noun is either doing or has had done to it.
 
The following can help you keep track of the main ways you use participles in your 
writing:
 
 As adjectives (their primary function)
 
 As nouns (as a logical extension from the adjective)
 
 As verbs
Using participles as adjectives
Participles function as adjectives in all ten of the Arabic verb forms. Some words you 
may have already encountered as adjectives are actually participles.
 
English and Arabic both can use participles as adjectives. The adjective exciting has 
the same -ing ending as the participle drinking. One difference, however, is that Arabic 
uses participles in place of adjectives for meanings that English speakers wouldn’t 
expect a participle to convey.
In the following examples, I underline in the English the adjective that uses a partici-
ple in the Arabic
.ﻛﺎﻥﹶ ﺍﻟﻄﱠﻘﹾﺲﹸ ﺣﺎﺭﹼﺍﹰ ﺟﹺﺪﹼﺍﹰ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ
(kaana-T-Taqsu haaran jiddan ’amsi. The weather was very hot yesterday.)
ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﹸﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺪﻳﺪﹸ ﻣﹸﺆﹶﺩﱠﺏ ﺃﹶﻟﹶﻴﹾﺲﹶ ﻛﹶﺬﻟﹺﻚﹶ ؟
(Sadiiquka al-jadiidu mu’addab, ’alaysa kadhaalika? Your new friend is polite, 
isn’t he?)
Using participles as nouns
Many adjectives in Arabic have come over time to be used as nouns in their own 
right. A classic example in Arabic is the participle ( ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱmudarris; teaching). Over 
time, the meaning of this participle changed to denote one who teaches, that is, a 
teacher. If you ask Arabic speakers or writers to tell you what ( ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱmudarris) 
means, their first and immediate answer will be teacher. Even so, if those same speak-
ers or writers need to form the participle of the verb ( ﻳﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱﹸyudarris; to teach), they’ll 
form the word ( ﻣﹸﺪﹶﺭﱢﺱmudarris) for that as well because it still remains a participle.

 Chapter 18: Active and Passive Participles 297
 
Unlike Arabic, English doesn’t like to use participles as nouns. Instead, English speakers 
tend to use a class of nouns called the nomen agentis, the “noun of doing.” To form these, 
you add -er to the end of the word. Words such as teacher, singer, and baker are examples.
Here are several example sentences that use participles as full nouns in Arabic:
.ﻟﹶﻢﹾ ﻳﹶﺮﹾﺟﹺﻊﹾ ﺍﻟﻌﺎﻣﹺﻞﹸ ﺑﹶﻌﹾﺪﹶ ﺍﻹﺟﹾﺘﹺﻤﺎﻉﹺ
(lam yarji3 al-3aamilu ba3da al-’ijtimaa3i. The worker [one working] didn’t return 
after the meeting.)
.ﺃﹶﻋﹾﻠﹶﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹸﺬﻳﻊﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﱠ ﺍﻟﻄﹼﺎﺋﹺﺮﺓﹶ ﻗﹶﺪﹾ ﻫﹶﺒﹶﻄﹶﺖﹾ
’(a3lana al-mudhii3u ’anna-T-Taa’irata qad habaTat. The announcer [one 
announcing] reported that the plane had landed.)
Using participles as verbs
In many cases, a present participle can stand in the place of a verb. This usage antici-
pates the evolution of the participle into the present tense of the verb in most spoken 
Arabic dialects. Here’s an example in which the word translated as sitting is the parti-
ciple being used as a verb:
.ﺍﻹﻣﹾﺮﹶﺃﹶﺓﹸ ﺟﺎﻟﹺﺴﺔﹲ ﺗﹶﺤﹾﺖ ﺍﻟﺸﱠﺠﹶﺮﺓﹺ
(al-’imra’atu jaalisatun taHt ash-shajarati. The woman is sitting under the tree.)
 
You’re sending an e-mail to a good friend. To complete it, select the appropriate 
forms of the participles from the word bank. You need to use all the different types of 
participles discussed in this chapter for this exercise.

further hone your ever-increasing Arabic skills.

Chapter 19
Ten Mistakes to Avoid in Arabic
I
 hope you’ve made a lot of mistakes in Arabic. Because that means you’ve tried to 
use your Arabic, no matter how much of a beginner you may yet be. That said, I’m 
sure you’d like to know how to avoid some of the most common mistakes English 
speakers tend to make when producing Arabic either in speech or in written form. 
Knowledge is the power to ever improve your use of Arabic. So in this chapter, I com-
pile the ten most common mistakes you should be careful to avoid.
Using Incorrect Word Order
Both English and Modern Standard Arabic are word order languages. What’s that, you 
ask? It’s a language in which action is indicated by where the subject appears relative 
to the verb. Consider, for instance, this sentence: The cat ate the mouse. You know the 
cat did the action because subjects come before the verb in English. But, in fact, 
English and Modern Standard Arabic are two languages that don’t use the same word 
order at all! The only common point between them is that the object of a verb comes 
after the verb. But if you adjust your English grammar instincts in just a few ways, 
you can improve your Arabic.
The following are some pointers to keep your Arabic word order in line:
 
 Put your verb first, and then state your subject. For example:
 
 .ﻳﹸﺤﹺﺐﱡ ﺃﹶﺣﹾﻤﹶﺪﹸ ﺃﹸﻣﱠﻪﹸ
 
( yuHibbu ’aHmadu ’ummahu. Ahmad loves his mother.)
 
 Make sure your adjective is placed after the noun it describes. Your English 
instinct is to talk about your new car. Instead, rave about:
 
 ﺳﹶﻴﹼﺎﺭﹶﺗﹸﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﺠﹶﺪﻳﺪﹶﺓ
 
( sayyaaratuka al-jadiida; literally your car the new)
 
 Place any adverbs at the end of your sentence. For example:
 
 .ﺳﹶﻨﹸﺴﺎﻓﹺﺮﹸ ﺇﻟﻰ ﻣﹺﺼﺮ ﻏﹶﺪﺍﹰ
 
( sanusaafiru ’ilaa miSr ghadan. We will travel tomorrow to Egypt.)
To explore word order and verbs in more detail, see Chapter 2. For more information 
on the use of adjectives and adverbs, go to Chapter 6.

Part V: The Parts of Ten 
Writing in the Wrong Mood
If you use the wrong mood when writing Arabic, everyone will still understand what 
you mean. But they’ll also, of course, understand that you don’t know how to use the 
right mood! One way around the problem, especially when you’re just starting out, is 
to drop off all the final vowels from your verbs. Putting the wrong vowel on a verb is 
worse than no vowel at all. But when you want to distinguish yourself, lock in your 
knowledge of the formation and use of the Arabic verb moods. You’ll be sure to stand 
out. (See Chapter 13 for more on the many moods of Modern Standard Arabic.)
Adding Colloquialisms to Your Writing
It’s good to know some colloquial Arabic, especially if you’re going to be spending 
any significant time in an Arabic-speaking country. But Arabs are proud of their for-
mal language, which they call Modern Standard Arabic. So learn some colloquialisms 
to use with new friends in speech, but keep them completely out of your writing.
 
While I’m on the topic of colloquial speech, I want to give you a word of warning 
about slang. You’ve probably seen books for sale that promise to tell you all the 
“naughty” language your teacher never taught you. But don’t fall for it. No one will be 
impressed if you use the Arabic equivalent of profanity. Instead, stand out as an 
accomplished writer of Modern Standard Arabic and keep it clean.
Translating Word for Word
Translating word for word is an understandable habit when you’re attempting compo-
sition in a new language. And you can even learn the use of important vocabulary just 
by trying to look up words that you think you need. But do remember that languages 
convey meaning in different ways.
Languages like Spanish and Italian are related enough that a word-for-word-translation 
from one to the other would probably be accurate most of the time. English and 
Arabic, however, are completely unrelated. As a result, what English uses a word to 
convey, Arabic may accomplish through a particular form of the verb. And Arabic 
may have one word where English has two.
 
The only way to get out of the bad habit of translating word for word is just to get a 
lot of Arabic practice under your belt. As you immerse yourself in the sentence struc-
tures and cadences of your new language, you’ll develop a sense of how to express 
yourself in Arabic without thinking through English first.
Overusing Pronouns
English has lost the verb endings that its distant cousins like Russian and Spanish still 
maintain. As a result, in English, you have to use pronouns to convey who’s doing the 
action of a verb. Arabic, on the other hand, puts prefixes and suffixes on the verb to tell 
your reader or listener who’s being described as performing the action of the verb.

305
 Chapter 19: Ten Mistakes to Avoid in Arabic
But Arabic pronouns are used in some instances. For example, they can be used to 
express emphasis. Take a look at this sentence:
ﻫﹶﻞﹾ ﺃﹶﻧﹾﺖﹶ ﺗﹸﺮﻳﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻥﹾ ﺗﹶﺬﹾﻫﹶﺐﹶ ﺃﹶﻳﹾﻀﺎﹰ؟
(hal ’anta turiidu ’an tadh-haba ’ayDan? Do you want to go as well?)
The pronoun also can be used as the copula (a word that links the subject and predi-
cate in a sentence). When used in this way, the pronoun stands in place of the absent 
present tense verb to be, as in this sentence:
.ﺃﹶﻣﹼﺎ ﺍﻟﺮﱠﺟﹸﻞﹸ ﻫﹸﻨﺎﻙﹶ ﻓﹶﻬﹸﻮﹶ ﺻﹶﺪﻳﻘﻲ
’(ammaa ar-rajulu hunaaka fa-huwa Sadiiqii. The man over there is my friend.)
But in most sentences with a verb, you can leave the pronoun out all together, such 
as with the second verb of this sentence (English usage still requires the use of the 
pronoun, but the Arabic can go without):
.ﺗﹶﺮﹶﻙﹶ ﻣﹸﺤﹶﻤﱠﺪﹸ ﺃﹶﻣﹾﺲﹺ ﻟﻜﹺﻦﹾ ﺳﹶﻴﹶﺮﹾﺟﹺﻊﹸ ﻏﹶﺪﺍﹰ ﺇﻥﹾ ﺷﺎﺀﹶ ﺍﷲ
(taraka muHammadu ’amsi laakin sa-yarji3u ghadan ’in shaa’a ’allah. 
Muhammad left yesterday, but he will return tomorrow, God willing.)
I underlined the second verb to show you the lack of the pronoun there. Refer to 
Chapters 2 and 8 for more details on Arabic pronouns.
Forgetting to Coordinate Gender
One of my students recently had a difficult time with the concept that in Arabic the word 
for table, ( ﻃﺎﻭﹺﻟﺔTaawila), is feminine. She wanted to know what made the table feminine. 
The answer is that nothing made the table feminine. It just is. But knowing the gender of a 
noun is crucial if you want to describe the noun with an adjective or make it the subject 
of a verb. After all, Arabic practices gender coordination with those parts of speech.
My advice is to go ahead and play it pretty loose at first. As long as you’re putting 
your adjective right after the noun and putting your subject right after the verb, you’ll 
be understood even if you make gender mistakes. The mistakes will correct them-
selves when you have encountered enough cases of the right answer.
Using the Incorrect Case
Knowing when to use the nominative, accusative, and genitive case endings in Arabic 
can take a lot of practice. But don’t worry! There are exercises in this book that can 
help you get a handle on how they work (see Chapter 4).
 
If you’re uncertain about what case ending you should use, just leave the final syllable 
vowel-less. The formal final vowels of Modern Standard Arabic are ordinarily not pro-
nounced at all in media sources anyway. So, if you don’t fill out the final vowels, no 
one will suspect that you did it because you were unsure of them. But also go ahead 
and develop a sense for when the cases are correct and add them in so that you can 
stand out as an accomplished Arabic speaker and writer.

306
Part V: The Parts of Ten 
Spelling Words Improperly
Some of the consonants in Arabic are close in pronunciation to others. As a result, 
nonnative speakers and writers sometimes forget over time whether, for instance, a 
word has a ( ﺡHaa’) versus a ( ﺥkhaa’) or a ( ﺱsiin) versus a ( ﺹSaad). (But I’ve 
seen plenty of misspelled words written by native Arabic speakers and writers as well.) 
If you’re ever in doubt, reach for your dictionary to be sure of the correct spelling. You’ll 
not only deepen your knowledge, but you’ll keep your writing as pure as possible.
Ignoring Idiomatic Uses of Prepositions
Prepositions are notoriously idiomatic in any language. I recently used the idiom plug-
ging away in a conversation with my Romanian-American wife. She speaks excellent 
English, but she had to ask me what exactly was being plugged and how anything 
could be plugged away. When I told her that the idiom means to be persistent in an 
action, she rolled her eyes and replied, “And you say Romanian is difficult!”
When you look in the dictionaries of this book, you’ll notice that two different prepo-
sitions can mean with. Two different prepositions can both mean to as well. And 
another preposition can mean both in and at, depending on the context. I explain in 
the dictionaries the distinctions between these prepositions.
Make sure that when you learn a preposition you don’t just memorize a simple 
English equivalent. The precise usage is an important part of the prepositions. You 
can review prepositions in Chapter 12.
Making Words Plural That Shouldn’t Be
There are two important cases when your English instinct will suggest the use of plu-
ral but Arabic actually would use singular. If you use the singular in these cases, 
you’ll prevent a common mistake. Here are the two cases to watch for:
 
 As you know, verbs should come before the subject in an Arabic sentence. When 
the subject is plural, you use a singular verb (even though many people may be 
doing the action). Any verbs that follow the plural subject are plural. Here’s an 
example of this grammatical construction:
 
 .ﺧﹶﺮﹶﺝﹶ ﺍﻟﺮﱢﺟﺎﻝﹸ ﻣﹺﻦﹶ ﺍﻟﺒﹶﻴﹾﺖ ﻭﹶﺩﹶﺧﹶﻠﻮﺍ ﺍﻟﻤﹶﺪﹾﺭﹶﺳﹶﺔﹶ
 
( kharaja [sing. verb] ar-rijaalu [plural noun] mina-l-bayti wa-dakhaluu 
[plural verb] al-madrasata. The men left the house and entered the school.)
 
 When you have to create the plural of several inanimate objects, you always use 
feminine singular adjectives to describe them. Here’s an example of what I mean:
 
 .ﺍﻟﺒﹸﻴﻮﺕﹸ ﻓﻲ ﺗﹺﻠﹾﻚﹶ ﺍﻟﻤﹺﻨﹾﻄﹶﻘﹶﺔﹺ ﺟﹶﻤﻴﻠﹶﺔﹲ
 
( al-buyuutu [plural noun] fii tilkaa-l-minTaqati jamiilatun [singular adjec-
tive]. The houses in that area are beautiful.)

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Fine-Tune 
Your Arabic Skills
You’ve already demonstrated that you intend to do whatever necessary to 
improve your Arabic skills. After all, you’ve bought this book, haven’t you? In 
this chapter, I share ten tips for how to best apply yourself to your exploration of the 
beautiful and important Arabic language.
Master the Alphabet Early
A language and its writing system aren’t identical. A person can be illiterate and still 
be a native speaker of a language. The same goes for Arabic. I know plenty of native 
speakers of colloquial dialects who can’t read and write the language much at all. But 
your progress in Modern Standard Arabic really does depend strongly on your devel-
oping the ability to function comfortably in the Arabic script.
The transliteration in this book is a tool to help you master the reading and writing of 
Arabic by comparing the transliteration to what you think you’re reading in the 
Arabic script. The faster you learn the alphabet and how to both read it and write in 
it, the quicker you’ll be able to start taking advantage of a world of other resources, 
such as online news in Arabic.
Learn Singular and Plural Nouns Together
 
Because the majority of Arabic nouns have irregular plurals that can’t really be pre-
dicted from the form of the singular, you’re really wasting your time by learning a sin-
gular noun by itself. After all, you’re just as likely to refer to a specific number of 
books as you are to just one. So from the very start, learn the plural of any new noun 
you encounter. The dictionaries in this book include the plural of every noun included.
Build Your Vocabulary
Mastering grammatical constructions and the forms of irregular verbs is crucial busi-
ness on your journey to being a competent writer and speaker of Arabic. But, let’s 
face it; if you don’t know the word in Arabic for clock, you’re going to have a hard 
time talking about one! (By the way, the Arabic word for clock is [ ﺳﺎﻋﹶﺔsaa3a].)

308
Part V: The Parts of Ten 
 
Here are a few ways to boost your vocabulary:
 
 Spend some time speaking casually with friends or loved ones. Have a notebook 
handy, and every time someone uses a basic word you don’t know in Arabic, 
write it down. Later, look up those words in a good English-Arabic dictionary and 
commit them to memory. Then you can practice forming sentences in which you 
need that new vocabulary item.
 
 Read large amounts of Arabic without worrying about understanding every 
word. Over time you’ll pick up words that keep reappearing based on the con-
text in which you encounter them.
Explore Arab Culture
Go online (or to the library) and begin exploring the world of Arab culture, whether it 
be the rich literary tradition, the impressive scientific achievements, or the cinema. 
Knowing more about the culture behind the language that you’re learning helps you 
better understand the language because basic cultural concepts often come up in 
writing and speech.
As an example, knowing the importance of the month of ( ﺭﹶﻣﹶﻀﺎﻥramaDaan; Ramadan) 
will provide you with an abundance of phrases and vocabulary that appear yearly in 
Arabic language media. (Ramadan is the month during which Muslims observe a total 
fast during daylight hours.) Knowing more about the culture behind Arabic can also 
give you an appreciation of the global importance of the language you’re learning 
(and thus inspire you to work hard to experience it more deeply).
One last point on culture: Don’t forget to frequent an Arab restaurant — if one is near 
you. Personally, I adore the dish ( ﻭﹶﺭﹶﻕ ﻋﹺﻨﹶﺐwaraq 3inab; stuffed grape leaves). Order it 
and tell them I sent you. You won’t regret it.
Memorize Proverbs and Passages
There’s great value in memorizing some select Arabic proverbs. If you happen to pull 
them out at an apropos time, your Arab friends will be endlessly impressed. But 
besides wowing your friends, proverbs also can be good tools for learning vocabulary 
in context.
Here are a few proverbs to get you started:
.( ﻓﹶﺘﱢﺶﹾ ﻋﹶﻦﹺ ﺍﻟﺠﺎﺭ ﻗﹶﺒﹾﻞﹶ ﺍﻟﺪﹼﺍﺭfattish 3ani-l-jaar qabla-d-daar. Search out the neighbor 
before the house.) In other words, your neighbors can make your life miserable, 
no matter how nice your house is.
.( ﻣﹶﻦﹾ ﺳﹶﻜﹶﺖﹶ ﺳﹶﻠﹺﻢﹶman sakata salima. He who is silent is safe.) So, if you don’t 
speak rashly, you won’t regret your words later.
.( ﺍﻹﻧﹾﺴﺎﻥﹸ ﻳﹸﺪﹶﺑﱢﺮﹸ ﻭﹶﺃﷲﹸ ﻳﹸﻘﹶﺪﱢﺭﹸal-’insaanu yudabbiru wa-’allahu yuqaddiru. Humans 
plan, and God preordains.) (Essentially, this is the Arabic equivalent of the notion 
that if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Fine-Tune Your Arabic Skills
No matter what your personal religious tradition is, memorizing key texts, such as the ( ﺍﻟﻔﺎﺗﹺﺤﹶﺔfaatiHa), the opening Surah (chapter) of the Qur’an, or the Lord’s Prayer in 
Arabic will also ground you in some important vocabulary and convey your apprecia-
tion for Arab culture.
Be Brave and Use Any Arabic You Can
You’ll continuously encounter Arabs who simply can’t believe that you have learned 
even a little Arabic. As a result, everyone you encounter will be extraordinarily gener-
ous of you for your efforts. No matter what mistakes you make, you’ll be praised with 
the words, “You speak it better than me!” (Even though you’ll know better.)
 
The upshot of all this is that you can (and should) just relax and use whatever Arabic 
you have. It’s a win-win situation for you. No matter what comes out of your mouth, 
you’re a hero. And the effort of trying to produce Arabic will help you get even better.
Being brave is also good advice for working your way through this book. Don’t labor 
too much over any one item in the practices. What’s the worst that could happen? 
That you find out you were wrong? I wish I had a nickel for every time I tried to pro-
duce language and was wrong! When you don’t get something right, just review it 
another day and your mistake will have been well worth making.
Practice Regularly
You’ve heard it said that Rome wasn’t built in a day. And no one has ever learned 
everything there was to know about a language in a day either. You’ve likely seen 
books and programs promising that with their product you could speak Arabic in one 
week. Don’t bother buying them. Unless you’re a linguistic genius (and I’m certainly 
not), the book or program won’t help you accomplish that goal.
 
Much more important is the regular study of Arabic. Ten minutes a day is better than 
90 minutes once a week. To acquire a language, you need to regularly train your brain 
to think in the words and grammatical patterns of your target language. Obviously I 
suggest that you study more than ten minutes a day. But, whatever you do, do it 
regularly.
Consult a Variety of Resources
This book is a tool (and a good one at that!). There’s a lot of Arabic for you to master 
between these covers. But you can supplement this book with other sources of the lan-
guage. For instance, you can read and listen to Arabic news online at a variety of sites.
I recommend the BBC (news.bbc.co.uk/hi/arabic/news), where you can find 
news stories translated into Arabic as well as audio of the main stories of the day. 
The good thing about the BBC is that you can also click on the English page. There 
you can read the English source of the story and learn the English equivalents for any 
words you need without looking them up in the dictionary.

Part V: The Parts of Ten 
Another valuable pursuit is finding a few songs in Arabic and listening to them regu-
larly. Combining music and language is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it’s also 
helpful in learning.
Discover How You Learn Best
Personally, I’m a visual learner. I can’t hear a word spoken and learn it in any credible 
way. I need to see the word written, in Arabic, in order to acquire it as a vocabulary 
item that I can then use myself when the situation demands it. But you, my dear 
reader, are not me. You may very well be an auditory learner. And no one is right or 
wrong when it comes to learning. You just need to discover how you, personally, 
learn a foreign language best.
 
If you’re an auditory learner, you should make tapes of yourself reading the sentences 
and practices from this book. Burn it onto a CD and listen to it in your car. Download 
news from the Internet and do the same. If, on the other hand, you’re like me, write 
out the exercises in your own hand and study them that way. You may even be a 
learner of a totally different sort. Try a number of different things. Try crazy things! 
Success can’t be judged by anyone. Whatever helps you learn a language is what you 
need to focus on. Go find it!
Start All Over
Are you reading this chapter after working your way through the entire book? If so, 
let me congratulate you. But whether you have finished your exploration of 
Intermediate Arabic For Dummies or have just begun it, there’s value in starting all 
over in your Arabic language study. Every now and then I break out my first-year 
books in a language that I work in and start from scratch. The basics of a language 
make up 70 percent of it all. There’s no way to minimize the importance of deepening 
your mastery of 70 percent of Arabic (or any other language you want to function in).

o you need to quickly refresh your memory about 
one of the ten Arabic verb forms? This part has a 
chart for you to consult. And if there’s an Arabic word on 
the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t seem to recall it 
(and you need it to complete the exercises or talk to your 
friend or co-worker), this part helps you out with bilingual 
dictionaries.

Appendix A
Verb Chart
B
ooks on Romance languages, such as Italian, could include many charts showing 
you examples of the verbs — regular and irregular — in a reasonably-sized 
appendix. For Arabic, however, verb weakness issues would require dozens of pages 
to comprehensively show it all. So it’s all in this book, in the chapters touching on 
verbs, commands, participles, and verbal nouns.
But I wanted to give you a one-page chart that you can consult whenever you need to 
see the big picture of the ten forms. This one-page chart can be helpful whenever you 
want to see at a glance all the parts of speech for the forms lined up with each other. 
You’ll also find that it’s easier to memorize when you see the parts of speech this way.
In Table A-1, I give you the third person singular forms of the past and present tense, 
the verbal noun, and the masculine singular active and passive participles of all ten 
verb forms. This chart uses the root ( ﻓﻌﻞf-3-l; to do/make). Using f-3-l as a dummy 
root to display the various verb forms is a common convention in Arabic books, even 
though the root doesn’t actually occur in all these forms.
 
There’s no singular word pattern used for the verbal noun in Form I. When no form 
appears, it means that the verb form doesn’t exist.

Appendix C
Arabic-English Dictionary
I
n this appendix, I provide some of the Arabic vocabulary used in this book. It’s 
arranged alphabetically by the English transliteration, for your use in completing 
the practices or learning valuable new words. I provide you with the past and present 
tenses of all Arabic verbs (in that order). I also provide you with the singular of every 
noun and adjective as well as the plural (except where the plural is regularly formed, 
such as the sound plurals). To discover more about plural formation, go to Chapter 5. 
To search out the formation of adjectives, flip to Chapter 6.
Note: Other larger dictionaries you buy may organize the words by root, but I want 
you to be able to quickly find a word based on the form you actually have in your 
practice exercise. So I arranged this dictionary alphabetically by the order of the let-
ters in the Arabic alphabet. You can find a list of those letters in order on the Cheat 
Sheet at the front of the book.
