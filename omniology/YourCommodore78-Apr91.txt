THE PLEASURES OF THE PALM!
We all know that the
Commie C64 is the
spunkiest computer
available and that you
love it so much that you
would want to take it
everywhere with you,
more than your over-
loved teddy or dog-eared
comfort blanket, but let's
face it - there would be a
few technical hitches if
you wanted to transport it
everywhere with you!
Even the GS console is a
bit big to take to your
Grannies. However, don't
despair cos Granstand,
UK's leading brand of
electronic hand held LCD
games, may just solve the
problem of sitting bored
out of your wits during yet
another British Rail delay
by releasing 20 of your
best loved games on

hand held LCD.
David Evans,
marketing director
explained to YC
"Performance of these
titles in the USA and parts
of Europe has been
dramatic over the last 12
months and we expect a
similar development in
the UK for 1991.
Popularity of the titles is
fuelled by the explosion in
the TV interactive games
systems market." Yeah
OK Dave  L e t's
translate - he means he's
sussed that you lot out
there spend night after
night square-eyed over
your fave computer
games, so he thought you
might want to play them
even more and has
cashed in on the fact!
Spiffy games like
Shinobi, Paperboy and
Thunder Blade will be in

DEAD 'ARD
Suppose you lot think that
Hardware is only a name
given to the likes of your
Commodore 64; well it
ain't now! Hardware is the
lastest in Sci-Fi thrillers
being hailed as the
Bladerunneraerminator of
the Nineties and I thought
it was rather spiffy too in
that horrifying and gorey
kinda way!
It's set in the far off
future (hopefully) which is
ﬁlmed in a pink-ﬁltery arty,
and truly spectacular, way
with a similarly spooky
and atmospheric
soundtrack. It's basically
about a Mark 13 - which is
an unfriendly robot, not
the latest in Ford Cortinas
- which has the amazing
ability to reconstruct itself
from electrical sources
and then goes on a mad
killing spree.
It's not all blood, gore
and the odd arm ﬂying
around, it's about
relationships, it's about
the kinda future we are
building, it's about
technology and the
mistakes it can make and
it's well worth a watch (but
don't sleep with your
Commodore 64 beside
your bed afterwards!)
Also those nice people
from Hardware Land have
given YC some super
Hardware goodies, namely
a copy of the Hardware
vid, a Hardware baseball
cap, and a wicked
Hardware watch to three
winners. And all you have
to do to be in with a
chance of winning one of
these sets is build a killer
robot with your C64 (ha
only joking)... simply

AND LASHINGS OF
COMPUTER FUN!
It's always been a mystery
to me just why all those
mysteries happened just
when the Famous Five
were on school holidays,
but it's no mystery why
Enigma Variations have
signed up those ﬁve
famous meddling kids,
cos it's a good idea for a
super range of computer
adventure games.
Enigma Variations,
those clever dudes
responsible for
programming Postman
Pat amongst other things,
is soon to release "The
Famous Five 1 - Five on a
Treasure Island" based on
Enid Blyton's endearing
book - if you didn't know
already.
Using the "Worldscape"
adventure system,
you will be able to
transform into
Anne, George (a
girlie), Julian, or
Dick
(unfortunately you
cannot transform
into Timmy the
Dog!) to solve the
mystery of the
Treasure Island.
The game
features the best
in text parsers
and many
graphical
locations but
unfortunately
does not come
complete with jam
sandwiches, push
bikes and lashings
of ginger beer!
Blow me and well I never - what
will they come up with next!
Cheetah, the world's leading
joystick maker has really
surpassed itself this time with -
wait for it -  the AEROSKATE.
Aeroskate is a skateboard
thingy attachment that links in
with your C64 so you can control
games with the nifty footwork
you've been practising for years
and now you can impress your
old parents in the privacy of
your own living room! It comes
in two packages, with, or
without the Cheetah Skateboard.
If you purchase the device
without the Skateboard you can
just use it with your own board.
Just imagine the capabilities,
you'll be able to jump aboard
and let your skill in balance,
footwork and aggression take
over. You'll lean to avoid
obstacles and kick to dodge
missiles. A built in Hand Control
lets you zap em back or jump
out of their way.
So will I be able to play me
normal games? With great
difﬁculty, but Cheetah is
currently working with Titus to
design speciﬁc games for the
Aeroskate, including Skateboard
sims, Ski Runs, Shoot 'Em Ups,
Surﬁng and Driving Sim's and
obviously other software houses
will follow with their own.
It's bound to be a runaway
success but what worries me is
the extent of carpet burns and
broken porcelain!

So who's the geezers that actually spout their
babble and expect you to believe it? Who's the
blokes that you're more often than not likely to
see down a pub in Milton Keynes? And who's
those perculiar fellows who you once bumped into
in Sainbury's who had a trolley full of cans of coke
and Twix party packs?
This month we asked them all what presenter of
'The Word' they were most like, and why?
Rik Henderson - Ed
"Deﬁnitely Terry Christian - the
bloke who sits in his armchair
and abuses the audience ('Shut
er faces, yer rabble!!!', Tee,
brow them a ﬁsh and they'll be
ppy!!!', etc)."
ik's certainly got the loud
shirts and sarchasm, except the
closest he's ever got to
Manchester is getting stuck in the toilet in a service
station in Newport Pagnell.

"I see myself as the voice that
gives you all those useless
factual questions just before an
advertising break, and the
answers after!"
Jeff's favourite question is:-
Which of these four people is
really Jeff Davy? Post
Apocalypse, Oozin' Eugene, Purple Fishlord, Jeff Davy.
AFTER THE BREAK
Answer:- None of them! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Simon Dale - Staff Writer
"Amanda De Cadenet? She
always gets the crappy tasks
too!!! Mind you, I wouldn't mind
training with the candidates for
Miss America!"
Simon couldn't possibly be
Amanda De Cadenet, for a start
he's too useful, and also when
wind blows in his ear it doesn't
come whistling out the other side.
THE CREDIT CARD
The scores on the Credit Card are worked out by the four minor
categories (Sonics, Graphics, Fix Factor, Half Life) are all marked out
of 10 (10 being the bestest).
Overall is a percentage (ie. out of 100%). And here's what the score
means:
0-25 0 Forget it!!! This game is so bad that it's only use is as a
tenner's worth of door stop.
26-50 0 Pretty naff, really! This game would maybe be wcwth buying
if you needed some ﬁre fuel or something.
51-75 0 Actually quite alright. Not the reviewer's cup of tea, but
somebody might ﬁnd it playable.
76-84 0 A good game, but not a great one! Worth buying if you've
got the money to spare.
85-99 0 Truly mega game, and well worth a YC FUN ONE accolade.
If you don't get this game you must be brain dead.
100 0 Such a good game that the commie 64 was built just to play
it The sort of game that you load up when your pathetic 16-bit
machine owning friends pop round.

I
the open sea' kind, not
the 'that'll be two quid
for a copy of Kick Off') the
most nafﬁng off thing that
could possibly happen to
you, apart from being
hung, drawn and
quartered (THAT would
really naff you off), would
be to have all your
illgoften gains nicked from
the treasure island that
you buried it on (it's your
own fault though, maybe
you shouldn't've placed a
large red cross on top of
the sand, with a sign that
says "X marks the spot"!)
What's even worse
than having all your loot
pinched is that some Paul
Daniels-alike has done the
deed, and we all know
how much pirates hate
wizards (especially short
pillocks with scruffy wigs).
So it's time to get your
cutlass in your hand (it's a
sword, it's a sword!) and
slash your way to the Isle
of many strange things,
where you should ﬁnd
your enormous stash of
cash (and also a Debbie
McGee lookalike who
you'd not do too badly to
rescue). And if you're a bit
dodgy at the old
swashbuckling bit you
could even get a friend to
die hopelessly with you.
This is the background
to Domark's new action
adventure style slash-em-
up soon to be released on
the Tengen label. It's
origins are rooted ﬁrmly in
the local arcade (or kebab
shop), but on the idea
front the theme, if not the
gameplay, is pretty fresh
(ie. not ﬂogged to death,
like those ninja thingies).
The weird thing is that
pirates are so appealing
for action and adventure
that it bafﬂes me why
there haven't been an
inﬂux of games revolved
around the profession
(although I have little
doubt that we'll now see
thousands of games with
Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. in
them).
Yo, ho, h o  an d  a
bottle of ru m,

Skull & Crossbones is a
hack'n'slash game in the
true sense of the phrase.
You get the chance to play
either One Eye or Red Dog
(and if there are two
players, both can be used
at the same time) who
must progress through 8
levels in order to ﬁnally
meet, and kick the frag out
of, the wizard with all your
dosh. Along the way
there's tonnes of meanies
from all sorts of
backgrounds (depending
on which level you're on at
the time), including the
ninjas from the ninja level -
no doubt added to the
coin-op due to American
and Japanese pressure,

SPESH
O 0ohl Aahl They look suspiciously like Ninjas to me - and
this an original game and all that, at least they're not
green!
and harpies from the
Castle level which also
has an end-of-screen
meanie in the shape of
Medusa (you MUST avoid
her stare or you'll end up
As stiff as John Major's
suits).
All the other levels have
end-of-level baddies too,
and you'll need all kinds of
strategies to be able to
give them a good
smegging.
Fortunately you
have four
different types of
offensive move
to perform, three
forward swipes
and one back,
and a defensive
blocking move.
And also on the
way you can dig
up treasure, which will

either give you gold, food
(for health restoration), or
some form of cunning
'extra' weapon. If you do
manage to get all the way
through the game, and
there's another player with
you, you also get the
added thrill of having to
bash each other in order
to see who grabs the ﬁnal
wonga.
So even though S&C is
very much like many of the
other beat-em-up arcade
adventure games, there's
an awful lot of new features
that make the game THAT
much more exciting,
original and playable. The
spntes are, although
typically commie-like, very
large and well animated,
and the backdrops are
pretty spiffy (and very
colourful). Occasionally
there's an action sequence
(like swinging across
chasms in typical old-
fashioned movie style, etc.)
which will happen and this
is really just for show, but
good presentation never
does any harm.
There's a lot involved in
Skull & Crossbones, it
looks as if it's going to be
one of the better Tengen
conversions and you'll be
able to catch a really funky
review of it next
ish.
THE ARCADE MACHINE
Skull & Crossbones wasn't the most popular of coin-
ops mainly because the format was best suited for
home computers. The graphics were very nice
though and
the depth
was THAT
much more
extensive
than the
typical
Double
Dragon types.
The only
problem it
really had was that it
gobbled up more
cash from your pocket
than any pirate would
hide in his chest,
mainly due to the hard
gameplay.

made him. What it didn't
make was a good game,
and the sequel was equally
naff, so now we come to
third time lucky.
Mirrorsoft (under the
Imageworks label) has
played it's trump card
though in order to give
Back to the Future 3 a
better chance of being a
cracking game. This trump
is the acquisition of Probe
(Viz, Super Monaco GP,
Chase HO 2, Supremacy,
Golden Axe and thousands
of others) to do the code,
and game design - a wise
move in my opinion. And it
seems as if it's worked as
the game not only looks a
hundred dollars, each copy
could be sold for it as well.
It adopts the same idea
as Back to the Future 2, in
the fact that the overall
I I I
separate levels of sub-
games (four in all), but this
is really where all similarity
ends. For a
start all the
games are
more
involved than
any of those in it's
prequel and the
graphics and sound are
better in almost god-like
proportions.
Level 1
The adventure begins.
Clara, the school teacher
that Doc fancies, is heading
for a cliff in a runaway stage
coach and if you (as Doc)
do not save her she'll end
up deader than a
Northampton night club.
At the bottom of the
screen is a little 'radar' type
charty thing which shows
how far you are from her
coach, and how far she is
from the cliff face. You have
to catch up with her before
she takes the drop and this
is done in two ways. Firstly
there's a horizontally
scrolling section where you
are on horseback racing
along and trying to avoid all
the obstacles coming at
you and picking up her
knick-knacks for more
points. The second type of
stage
of the whole game) the
clock from the new clock
tower will tick one hour
down and you have only
four hours to spend, but
you're allowed to be shot
up to eight times before you
lose one life. If you manage
to rescue Clara it's onto the
next level...
Level 2
Now you get to play Marty
McFly (or "Clint Eastwood"
as he calls himself in the
movie) in a completely
different style of gameplay
to the ﬁrst level. Instead we
are treated to something
that most would link with
Operation Wolf, although
it's true origin comes from
the fun fair and, more
speciﬁcally, the shooting
galleries that you'd
always ﬁnd there.
This is my
favourite section
as targets pop up
from all over the
place and you
move a cursor over
them to shoot. Every
target hit adds to your
score and you have a time
limit in which to score
50,000,000 points. The
whole level is full of
humour and it's
culminated in when you
manage to hit all of the
coloured ducks and the
conveyor belt at the
bottom starts to show
prizes in a Generation
Game fashion.
It's about time (groan) that we got a decent
Back to the Future game, and this one even
makes up for what the others lacked.

THE FUTURE:I
Level 3
Apparently, when plans
were at the preliminary
stage, Amblin - the
production company
behind the movie - wanted
Probe to include as many
pie plates in the game as
they could humanly ﬁt in
(even though the ﬁlm on
had one pie plate throwing
scene, featuring only one
pie plate). So we ﬁnd
ourselves with a whole pie
plate throwing section, as
Buford and his gang are
holed out in the Saloon and
they have to be downed by
the plates.
The only prob is that
they have guns and they
shoot at you. Due to your
initiative though, you've got
an iron plate stuffed down
your poncho and this will
take up to eight blasts
before you get taken to that
DeLorean car in the sky.
Level 4
And so the ﬁnal level, and
it's a bit harder than the
rest (obviously). You're on
the top of the train that'll
propel the car back to the
future, and you must
collect logs in order to get
the train up to 88 MPH.
Unfortunately though the
train is already moving and
you only have a brief time
limit to grab them all and
jump into the car at the end
before the engine ﬂies off
the disused bridge and
Marty McFly becomes
Marty McPlummeting. And
there are loads of hazards
on the way too.
Not only are all of the
games whole ones in
themselves (each one is
better than an average

WAD A
LETTER
I used to buy 'another
magazine' every munf
until I heard of this
really cool, mega
magazine called VC. After
a few months, I realised I
was buying a real
magazine for the
Commodore 64 and not
the Amiga, which is what
'the other one' mostly
covers now. Now I know
I'm not wasting my wad.
One teeny prob. Last
munf I was reading the
Dream Team feature
(where there was another
picture of Rik with his
mouth open!) and Jeffrey
Davy's
"Most
outrageous
thing" just
ends with
"and
were".
Could
you
tell
me where
the rest is?
Aaron Hillard,
Leicester
PH: Yeah, YC's the best
C64 games mag and we
know it! About that
layabout Dream Team lot,
we can't help the Rik pic -
I don't think he ever
closes his
mouth
0  b u t  Jeff's
comment
should end
with: "...ﬁnally
picked up about 9
o'clock the
next day!"
Not that I
gave a damn.

PSYCHO!
I'm going b****y mad. My Commie power pack blew
up in my face. Aargh. I'm going to throw the thing
in the ﬁre. I thought of robbing a bank to get the
E22.95 for a new one. It's driven me up the wall
(Vroom, vroom, damn, I've just made two big black
tyre-marks on the wall). Maybe I could kill some rich
bloke. Hmmm... President Bush? No, too far away. The next door
neighbours? No, they're poor. I think I'll go back to the bank idea.
Oh, and in Feb's YC, you said there were ﬁve games and one demo and
I found three games and a demo. Explain, before I blow your ***** *******
head off with an Iraqi supergun.
Scott Turley, N. Ireland
PS. Be quick.
PPS. I'm counting: 5, 4, 3, 2...
PPPS. I'll mow you down with my motorbike!
PPPPS. I'm in with the b****y Maﬁa...
PH: OK, stop. stop! You're completely mad! Madder than me AND my brother.
Yup, there were only three games and a demo on the Feb tape. Are some people
never satisﬁed?
Of course, we're much too evil to just leave it there. That's why I'm gonna
send you a copy of Back to the Future III, because without a powerpack you
won't be able to play it! Ha, ha!
Y... Y... Y....
I've been buying YC
since the June 1990
issue, I reckon it's cool
but I got the
September issue and
the berk in the
newsagent gave me
another magazine tape!
Could you answer
these questions?
1) Why do you have
an arcade column
when YC is a C64 mag?
2) Why did you
choose to write about
the C64 when there are
Segas (which are
coon)?
John Luhr, New South
Wales, Australia
PH: Newsagents like that
make me MAD. Hand me
my ﬂamethrower and let
me at 'im. He won't be
able to tell Gardeners
Weekly from a pile of
ashes by the time I've
ﬁnished.
And about your
snivelling questions? 1)
As the saying goes:
"Arcade machine today,
C64 game tomorrow"
(probably) and 2) 'Cos if
we were a Sega mag,
we'd have to be called
Your Sega, or VS for
short, which we couldn't
do 'cos there's already a
mag called VS. Logic or
what?
RAD TAPE
I've been buying YC for
more than a year and I
think the games
cassettes are radical!
We have to wait a long
time for the magazine
but it's worth it!
Tim Dowell, South
Melbourne, Australia
PH: Sounds like you have
to wait as long for YC as I
do for the pitifully small
paycheque I use to buy
all my high-explosive
Ammo. Yeah, the games
cassettes are well radical,
but I ﬁnd they're not
HARD enough to knock
people out, you just make
a big bruise. Pah!
DONER IT
MAKE YOU
SAD?
I'll start by saying
"Doner Kebabs Rule".
I've been buying your
mag ever since your
new image even
though I pay ALISS6
(E2.50) and it's two
months late... [STOP
THERE! PH]
Richard Fares, Sydney,
Australia
PH: Stop RIGHT there.
There's a pattern
emerging 'ere. Is it my
imagination or is there a
friggin' Oz invasion going
on? Let's try the next
letter...
SAW POINT
Fair go. Your mag
arrived on our
Newsagents' shelves a
week ago. I'm sending
this straight back and
you'd better have a
copy for me 'cos me
mate's on his way over.
He's only got one
arm so he just took the
light chainsaw. And it
takes TWO Poms [Does
he mean us? PH] to lift
an Aussie light
chainsaw!
Harold Eggleton,
Victoria, Australia
PH: it IS an Oz invasion. I
knew I could smell sheep
dip. And this guy's the
maddest of them all. I'm
blowed if I know what
he's on about and I'm a
bit ﬂamin' worried about
the one-armed Aussie
chainsaw murderer. I like
my limbs as they are,
thankyouverymuch.
GO-CART
I have two questions to
ask you:
1) Can you use the
C64GS games on the
Commie 64?
2) When is Post
Apocalypse going to
kill the bloomin' baby?
Danny Potter,
Thamesmead
PH: 1) What's that
whacking great hole on
the back of your C64 for,
d'ya think? 2) I think my
brother ought to be more
worried about what the
baby's gonna do to HIM.

THE NEAGOX PLOT
In the year 2020 the earth has
become so polluted that most
people are dying of different
strange diseases. Every time a
new child is born its mutated.
Therefore the earth's
government decided that the
earth's population had to move
to some other planet if
mankind should
survive. Three
years later, in
the year 2023,
the ﬁrst planet
was colonised.
From then on
mankind
colonised more
than 11 planets
in 30 years.
Your planet
NEAGOX was
colonised as planet no.8 in the
year 2044. Some 40 years later
an alien ace arrived on earth
It was the Zyxonions. They
came in peace and people had
belief in them. But then one
day the Zyxonions showed
their real intentions and took
over the world. After which the
Zyxonions took over the world
government - no longer
allowing people to live a
decent life with their strict rule.
The Government of the
colonised planets eventually
joined forces and made a
defensive pact which involved
a group of special ﬁghter
pilots. This group was called
TERRORFORCE (032) and the
headquarters were situated on
NEAGOX. A couple of years
after this pact was made, the
Zyxonions began to attack the
colonised planets. The newly
trained TERRORFORCE ﬁghter
pilots were sent to destroy the
Zyxonions but they were
destroyed one by one. Now,
this is where you take over!!!
You are the last of the
ﬁghter pilots and you have to
win the ﬁnal battle on your
planet NEAGOX. Do you have
to what it takes to free the
human race from enslavement
of the Zyxonions????
CONTROL IN YOUR

Strategy Boardgame
Controls; Keyboard (see below)
The original version of GO-
MOKU is played on the same
19 by 19 board that the
fascinating (and very complex)
chinese game of 'Go' is played
on, and simply involves two
players (one black, one white)
placing pieces on a board until
one player wins by getting 5-
in-a-line in any vertical,
horizontal or diagonal direction
(a bit like a giant noughts and
crosses). When you ﬁrst run
the game you are presented
with a moderately interesting
title screen, and are invited to
hit the SPACE bar. You are
then given a command
summary, and you can start a
game by selecting 'T for
traditional GO-MOKU or 'H' for
a 'Hard' variation of the game I
have devised. (See 'Game-play
theory' below.) I recommended
you try the 'Hard' version - it
isn't really any harder to play,
just more interesting.
I don't want to ramble on
too much in a this is the key
you press' command list, since
if you've enough wit to switch
on the computer and load the
tape, the commands won't
pose a problem. Remember
that if you do have problems,
the Ed runs a special 3am
help-line from the comfort of
his his own bidet. (Get the frag
out of here - Ed)

G A M E
Since a line of ﬁve wins, if you
get a row of four that is
unblocked at each end you
have effectively won the game,
unless your opponent can win
immediately by making a row
of ﬁve. This is because
whatever end your opponent
blocks, you can simply move
to the other end and win. By
similar reasoning. 2 open-
ended rows of three pieces
usually poses a winning threat,

•  '
because your opponent
cannot stop you making an
open-ended row of four out of
one of these rows of three.
Now, after serious analysis,
players of traditional GO-
MOKU found that whoever
moves ﬁrst should be able to
force a win early in the game
by making a double-threat of
three pieces. For this reason,
the Japanese have invented a
variation of the game called
Renju. In this game the ﬁrst
player to move (White) is
restricted in that he cannot
make moves that form certain
combinations of multiple
threats of three or more
pieces, and the board itself is
limited to 15 by 15 squares.
Now a certain amount of
reﬂection on this game has
lead me to believe that it is
really a bit of a botch. For a
start, you have restrictions
which apply to only one player,
which in itself is unnatural.
Further, the restriction of
simply depriving a side of his
strongest moves surely must
put that side into somewhat
passive role. What I felt was
needed was a natural
extension that doesn't interfere
with the games basic concept.
I have tried to achieve this by
changing the board itself, and
making certain squares
'illegal', ie. neither side can
play on them. If you run the
game and
select 'H' for
the hard
version you
will be able to
see the pattern
Have decided
to use.
Essentially I
have placed
an illegal
square at the
intersection of
every fourth
column an
row, counting
from the 2nd
row to the top
What I hope this achieves is a
'breaking up' of the boards
continually, making it
impossible (?) for the white
player to force a win every
time. This pattern also has the
effect of making some squares
stronger than others, and I
have put suitable weights into
the computer's game-play.
however I will leave you the fun
of discovering the relative
strength and weakness of
those areas for yourself!

"Another pint please Jim"
Alan Withersnips loves his
hourly visit to his local
pub, 'The Nags Head'. Today
seemed just like any other to
Alan, as he asked Jim the
Barman for another pint,
"...and one extra packet of
peanuts purleeeese!!!"
But little did he know.
On opening the peanuts,
Alan cried out in surprise as he
was sucked into a forth
dimensional parallel universe.
Pico-seconds later, Alan
awoke in rather unfamiliar
surroundings. After a short
scan of the area, he realised he
was, surprise-surprise, in the
Starship Coball. A voice rang
out in the previously silent
environment. "Hi!!, I'm your
friendly onboard computer.
Blast those aliens get lots of
points."
And so began the voyages
of Alan the Space Ace,
Commander of the Starship
'Cobalr, ready for anything,
anytime, anyplace.
BLACKJACK
Programmer: N. Sykes
Type: Complete game -
Strategy Cardgame
Controls: Keyboard
It's Friday night and you've
had a hard week at work! Your
partner has made up
mountains of sandwiches. The
fridge is full of amber nectar.
The table is laid out and you
are busy shufﬂing the cards.
If this scenario sounds familiar
to you, stand by for an
entertaining evening of card
playing with a difference. You
may well lose at this version of
'Blackjack' but you can rest
assured that you won't lose
your shirt, car, home or any
thing else, except perhaps
your pride.
In case you are unfamiliar
with the rules for Blackjack. I
will brieﬂy outline
the idea behind the
game. Each player
is dealt two cards.
The idea being to
make a score of 21
or as near as
possible. Aces
count as 1 or 11
depending upon
the circumstances.
After the cards
have been dealt
no-one will have a
score of more than
the required 21. Each player
takes his turn to decide
whether or not he wishes more
cards to increase his score
value, or to stick with what
they have. After all players
have had their turn the dealer
then reveals his cards. He may
deal himself more cards just as
the other players with one
exception. The dealer MUST
deal another card too if his
initial score is 16 or less.
This gives the players
slightly better odds of
winning the hand. When
the dealer completes his
turn, any player whose
cards add up to more than
the dealer's wins. Unless
the dealer himself has been
dealt 21.
In this computerised
version I have stripped out a
lot of the ﬁner points of the
game. Buying extra cards,
paying out speciﬁc odds, extra
odds for a royal pontoon etc.
The following is the breakdown
of the rules for this version.
The bank must draw extra
cards on a score of 16 or less.
The players may on any score
if they desire.
Blackjack is the best hand
and comprises of a score of 21
with 2 cards only.
To place a bet you use the
keys 1-9. Key 1 will place a bet
of 50, 2 places a bet of 100,
etc. (up to 9 which will bet
450). Key 0 will place a bet of
500 (this being the maximum
you can bet on any hand).
If you wish to be dealt
another card press 'C'.
If you wish to stay (stick)
press 'NV
Cards of the same value
may be split once, except for
4, 5 or 10. If aces are split you
receive only one card. Press
's'.
It you score Blackjack and
the bank has an ace you can
take even money by pressing
'E'.
The winner is the player
with the most cash when the
bank has no money le t
Cards are drawn randomly
from 4 decks and reshufﬂed
after 2 decks have been dealt.
TA P E  P R O B S ! ! !
If your ever-so-stonky, and
incredibly funky, YC
taperoonie steadfastedly
refuses to load it could be one
of three things:
a) The tape could be
faulty!!!
b) Your datasette could be
faulty!!!
c) The cat has peed on it
and when you put it in your
datasette not only does a
terrible stench come out. but a
strange 'Slopp! Sloop! Sloppr
noise can be heard.
If it's 'a' you should get a
new tape (from us). If your
answer's 'b' you should get a
new datasette. If it's 'c' you
should get yourself a new cat!
If you're absolutely, 100%
sure that it's the tape at fault,
pop it in a jiffy bag, with an
explanation of the problem,
and send it to:

THE SCORING SYSTEM
A couple of months ago Beverly received a press
release from Bondwell with a quote from the guv'ner
of the ﬁrm stating "We see Logic 3 as the BMW of
the joystick world...", so we've decided to rate the
joysticks on a similar parallel.
ENGINE - This is how well the joystick is made
inside (ie. does it have microswitches or what?)
BODYWORK - This is how sturdy the joystick is, and
how much torture the exterior can take.
STEERING - This is how accurate are the directions.
MILEAGE - This is how long will the joystick last
before conking out.
TOP SPEED - This is the overall rating for the game!!!
All of the above ratings are given in MPH. The ﬁrst
four are marked out of 50 miles per hour, and then
this is added up to give a Top Speed.
After this we give you a comparison on what motor
the joystick is most like.
ENGINE - The
microswitches give a
resounding 'click' every
time you point the shaft in
a direction and it makes
you feel as if the action is
very much controlled by
yourself. 45 MPH
BODYWORK - Although
the feel is very plasticky,
and the shaft is absolutely
teeny, it ﬁts very snuggly
in your hand and the
button is conveniently
placed for extremely fast
action. Left handed
players should beware, as
the main-stream version is
deﬁnitely designed for the
right handed majority. 34
MPH
STEERING - Excellent at
hitting those diagonals
ﬁrst time, and the other
directions are slid into with
ease. 47 MPH
MILEAGE - Although the
outer parts look quite
shoddy, the only part of
the joystick that'll wear
with age is the
presentation. 43 MPH
TOP SPEED - A very slick
joystick that is favoured by
most of the YC staff (I've
had mine for 3 years). It
was superb at both types
of game we tested it on.

CON VERTA
ENGINE - This is a micro
leaf joystick (meaning it
uses metal contacts for
directional play rather than
switches) and as such has
smaller, but occasionally
inaccurate, workings. 15
MPH
BODYWORK - Oh dear!!!
The whole stick is based
on the idea that it can
either ﬁt in your hand or
stick to the table - it fails
to do either. 10 MPH

STEERING - This is a bit
like stirring a bowl of
soup. There is no physical
indication of diagonals,
and I'm afraid that its
directional play is about as
effective as ﬂat tyre. 12
MPH
MILEAGE - If this ﬂimsy
excuse last for more than
a week of hard gameplay

KONIX
NAVIGATOR
ENGINE - Everything runs
very smoothly in this high-
class version of the Konix
Speedking. The
microswitches are very
robust but still very
responsive. 47 MPH
BODYWORK - A very slick
design that ﬁts snugly in
your hand with a little
shaft at the top. Also,
unlike its little brother, you
can use it in either hand.
46 MPH
STEERING - Easy to lock
into those diagonals, and
it's nice to see that the
normal directional play
doesn't suffer because of
this. Also the main stick
needn't travel very far to
reach it's slot, making it a
lot tighter than most
joysticks. 48 MPH
MILEAGE - At last a
plastic joystick that feels
as if it's been built to last.
Everything about it feels
sturdy. 47 MPH
TOP SPEED - This is truly
the joystick by which to
judge all others. And
above everything else it
even has a smart auto-ﬁre
(if the auto-ﬁre's on, you
have to press down the
main ﬁre button for it to
work, allowing you to
avoid things you don't
particularly want to shoot).
188 MPH
microswitches, and
although this Ouickshot
seems to work well
enough I just can't get to
grips with the almost
spongy mechanisms. 35
MPH
BODYWORK - One thing
you can't knock any of the
new range of Quickshots
for is their presentation. It
feels so good in your
hands that you honestly
don't want to let go. 48
MPH
STEERING - Like all the
sticks without
microswitches there is no
real indication of whether
you're placed in a
direction or not, but it all
seems very responsive to
me. 42 MPH
MILEAGE - This is hard to
say. I've known some
people who've had
Quickshots for years, but
others who've had to
continually replace them.
It really depends on what
type of games you play,
and whether you're an
aggresive person or not.
35 MPH
TOP SPEED - A gorgeous
looking joystick with the
ancient Ouickshot
mechanism inside. If you
like to be comfortable
ENGINE - I really don't like w h e n  playing this is the
joysticks without 
j
o
y
 for you. 160 MPH

APACHE
ENGINE - Exactly
the same inside as
it's brother (the Python 1)
and exactly the same
applies. 35 MPH
BODYWORK - Not as
appealing as most of the
Quickshot range, and feels
more plasticky. 35 MPH
STEERING - Again
identical to the Python 1.
42 MPH
MILEAGE - I honestly
can't see it taking the kind
of battering a game of
Swiv would give it. 28
MPH
TOP SPEED - Although it
seems to be pretty poor,
the Apache 1 is the ideal
joystick to have as a spare
(for when your mates
come round). You might
even like it as your ﬁrst
choice. 140 MPH

RIGHTGRIP
ENGINE - Works very well
due to the exterior being a
joypad in preference to a
joystick. One only
wonders how it ﬁts in? 47
MPH
BODYWORK - Easily the
funkiest looking out of the
lot of them. If you don't
want to use it as a joystick
you could always play
Batman and Robin with it
whilst zooming it through
the air. 50 MPH
STEERING - Immaculate,
as long as you get the
hang of using the
directional pad instead of
a stick. 50 MPH
MILEAGE - Again it's
made from a light plastic,
but it seems very sturdy,
and is not the sort of thing
that you'd play Track and
Field with anyway. 42
MPH
TOP SPEED - Although
weird initially this strange
beastie gives you the
ultimate control over any
game (apart from
wagglers). It performed
very well on the two
games we tested it on. -

other computers are
welcome for those of us
with consoles too. 46 MPH
BODYWORK - Exceptional!!!
It wouldn't look out of
place in the local arcade
and helps you to feel like
your really there. 50 MPH
STEERING - Faultless! 50
MPH
111111,4111
MILEAGE - If not abused
the Maverick 1 should last
for yonks and yonks and
yonks. 47 MPH
TOP SPEED - Joypads
are so comfortable to use,
and they certainly brighten
any coin-op conversion.
The Ouickshot joypad is
the best at an affordable

BODYWORK - Another
very weird looking joy in
the Navigator mould.
Couldn't fail to stand out
as it's a bright blue and
shiny plastic. 42 MPH
STEERING - The stick
part is a bit clumsy and
174 MP H
large for you to
come to grips
with at the most
urgent of times.
34 MPH
MILEAGE - A
hard one this!
It's a different
plastic to the
rest but it
seems far more
chunky and
built to last. 49
MPH
TOP SPEED -
Although it has
the worst
placed ﬁre
buttons in the
history of
joysticks, the
one at the front
is by far enough
for most uses.

RATINGS
NO STARS - Crap!!! Erm, what do you want me to
say!
- Not really very good, could use it to wipe your
bottom with!
- Okay for a rainy day, or a picnic in Milton
Keynes.
- Well worth the read, but collectors will
deﬁnitely not be bagging it up!
- A cracker of a read, well worth the third
mortgage to be able to buy it.
- So good that the pages invite you to
come in, have a cup of tea and a rather large
scone, and play a game of Pictionary.

With the success of the
monthly/bimonthly
anthology mags (such as
Deadline and
Crisis), it's quite
easy to give the
credit to them for
their originality.
The fact of the
matter is that
underground
fanzines have
been doing the
same thing for
absolutely
yonks (and
yonks and
yonks).
The only
problem that
exists here is
that they are
not very well
distributed in
the comic
outlets, and
it's unlikely
that you'll be
able to ﬁnd
the latest
copy of
'Nuns with big bikes'
unless you dig under the
masses of piles of comics
with 'X' in their titles. This
is a shame, and should be
something that'll be
rectiﬁed shortly, thanks to
the attitudes of the
smaller distributors. Even
still, I had to barge past
boxes of '2000ADs' and
'Marvel Presents' to be
able to grab a copy of
what could be the
showpiece for a plethora
of artists that tomorrow
will be the industry's
hottest talent.
In this ish we get the
chance to savour the
delights of Byzantium - a
dark future tale of the
dangers of technology -
by Garen Ewing (an artist
I've been in contact with a
few times in my shady
past) and Terry Stock as
the writer, Georgie & The
Dragon - a comedy, star-
hopping story - by Paul H.
Birch, Jez Hall and Joe
Ahern, with the other
highlight being Cath
McGrath The Telepath -
which is a serious short
tale about the curse of
telepathy - by David
Waddell, Gary Portman
and John Robbins. The
other regular strips will
need a few more episodes
to establish themselves,
as they seem to rely
heavily on action, and
tend not to dwell on plot.
Over The Edge will
need to tighten up it's
presentation a tad, and
perhaps include a couple
of strips that break from
the Science
Fiction/Fantasy mould, but
we've been guaranteed
that in the Editorial.

Al is by far the most
impressive anthology title
to day (and by far one of
the dearest too), and
although this'un's a fair bit
late, we've been treated
once again to strips with
more talent that 'Uncle
Bob's Butlin's Bognor
Regis cheeky talent show
and dog mastery
competition'.
The contents are a bit
on the saucy side so for all
those under the age of 16
it's best if you ask your
mam if you can have it ﬁrst
(otherwise you'll only have
to hide it under your
mattresses - and we all
know what a drag that is!),
and anyway, some of the
strips are a little complex
in plot anyway (we're not
talking 'nudey turtles'
here).
Inside is a hotch-potch
of strips (some that offer
more than one meaning
for that word), and they're

PREDATOR 2 #1 (of 2)
PUBLISHER: Dark Horse
PRICE: $2.50 U.S.
CREATIVE TEAM: Franz Henkel, Dan Berry,
Randy Emberlin
Los Angeles is so hot that the tarmac is
melting, and to make things worse there's a
drug war going on. To make things even more
bad a new Predator has arrived on Earth, and
his hunting ground is the city. Lieutenant
Harrigan is the man who is solely out to net the
drug barons, and he ﬁnds more than he
bargained for.
This comic is the ﬁrst part of the ofﬁcial
movie adaptation, and although it's very well
done, like all movie adaptations, it's really only
worth buying if you're not likely to see the ﬁlm,
but you'd like to know what happens anyway.
If you are going to see the ﬁlm, you'd be a dumb
plonker if you wanted to read the story before hand
(unless you like telling everybody else in the cinema
exactly what happens before the end of the movie, and
therefore having extremely large popcorn cartons
rammed up your bottom).
THE COLOUR OF MAGIC #1 (of 4)
PUBLISHER: Innovation
PRICE: S2.50 U.S.
CREATIVE TEAM: Scott
Rockwell, Steve Ross,
Daenck Gross Sr.
Anybody that's read Terry
Pratchett's wonderful
fantasy comedy novel
The Colour of Magic' will
be thrilled that it's ﬁnally
reached the pages of a
comic. It's a tale of
exploration and humour
that even Douglas Adams
would be proud of, and
although the book has far
more body to it, this
adaptation is quite
superb.
The colour of the
artwork is splendidly
done, and the only qualm
would be that the art
itself lends far more to Conan the Barbarian than any
humour strip. The story was always a good one for this
medium, Innovation has made it a great one.

Beebop - It is best to stand
on the ledge by Rocksteady
and make sure he's not
hitting you. Then crouch
down, use Donatello, and
keep ﬁring. Eventually
Beebop will jump into your
staff 8 times and kill himself.
Rocksteady - Work out
where he jumps and jump
up behind him. Hit him 8
times with Donatello to kill
him. Do not jump too close
or he will keep hitting you.
Mecaturtie - Again, work
out where he jumps and
stand next to where he's
going to land. Keep hitting
him 8 times with Donatello
or 16 times with any other
turtle.
Shredder - Jump to the
highest platform and
crouch down with
Donatello. Keep ﬁring and
he will jump into your Bo
and kill himself. Be careful
though, he'll jump to the
height of the platform and
ﬁre every so often, you'll
have to jump over the
bullets.

FORTRESS PUMA
SPIRIT
This YC tape game was
ﬁendish so G. J. Donoghue
has sent us this brief tip (a
ﬁver's on its way).
Hold down RUN/STOP and
keep the ﬁre button pressed
down for slow motion
gameplay (very useful for
tight squeezes).
ST
DRAGON
Another superb game, and
another tip from G. J.
Donoghue (and another ﬁver
for him).
Start the game and crash
into the bottom of the
screen, then restore the
game by pressing P then O.
Do the same 4 times, you
should now have immunity,
but you cannot collect extra
weapons.
weapon has the shortest
reach.
Try to collect as many
goodies, like Ninja Stars
and Boomerangs, as
possible because they help
on end of level baddies and
Mr Invincibility helps even
though it doesn't last very
long.
Robin Ogle also replies to
the Wingers plea sent out by
Kourosh Mojar. Not only
does he supply the solution
for the ﬁrst four levels of this
aging game, but a cheat that
deﬁnitely works too.
Apparently though, he didn't
want to give the last two
levels away because it
would be "too easy", and
Robins earned himself
another easy terrier.
Level 1
For this level you should use
the sword. When you start,
go right, killing any enemies
who appear under the ﬂoor
immediately. When you get
to the second part of the
temple, stay in one place
and wait for the golden
Ninjas to attack you.
When you kill one, collect
the spirit ball that he leaves
behind (it's either a Spirit,
Weapon Boost, or Smart
Bomb). Repeat this until
there's a minute left on the
clock, then run to a screen
with two mini volcanoes.
Kill ten of the men who
t•••t
o
jump out of the MVs and
when the end of level baddie
appears, go to the right
hand comer, change to
Ninja Stars, and keep
blasting. When a bullet goes
near you just jump over it
and keep blasting. Onward
level 2...
Level 2
Use the sword again. Keep
going right until you get to
the second bridge, change
to ninja stars and keep
running. The end of level
baddie is tricky. Firstly,
make sure there's no
ﬁreballs on screen, then,
whenever the scorpion goes
for you, jump up. This gives
you a few seconds to shoot
at him and when it charges
again, just repeat the above
tactics.
Level 3
Very tough indeed. Use
sword on this level. You've
got to jump over the swamp
giants, not kill them. It takes
a while to learn this, but
once you've perfected it
you'll manage it every time.
When you get to the end
of level baddie, switch to
dynamite and jump over it in
the same way as you did the
swamp giants. As it goes the
other way, give it a taste of
explosives. Repeat this until
it dies, but watch the small
Ninjas coming up from
behind.
Level 4
Dynamite on this level. Just
keep going onwards and kill
everything you see. You'll
lose loads of lives, but what
the hell!
On the ﬁnal drop, switch
to sword and move fast.
When you get to the end of
level baddies stay with the
sword and when you get the
chance, jump on top of them
and dig the sword in.
The Cheat
For this cheat you'll need
a reset switch. Reset on
the title screen and enter
POKE 10448, 173
SYS 2051
This gives you inﬁnite
lives.
KNIGHT
MARE
For most people this
game has been true to
its title, but for no
longer. Daniel
Broomﬁeld and Jamie
Cotter have sent us this
brief tip on how to get
past the second door,
for which they get a
ﬁver to share between
them.
Give the man a few
items and he gives you
a shovel. Dig with the
shovel under the
locked door.

MIDNIGHT RESISTANCE
Easily the most
addictive game for
many moons, we've
been inundated with
both pleas for help,
and tips galore. Robin
Ogle does one better,
and gives us loads of
tips for every level to
help us all ﬁnally
complete the game.
Fifteen quid is the least
we can give you (and
the most) Robin. Holy
big dosh!!!
Level I
A fairly simple level. Just
keep going right until you
get to the tank, then go to
the left-hand corner and
keep blasting at the tank.
When it ﬁres simply jump
over the bullet, the
second bullet just aims at
where you were in the sir
and presents no problem.
Go up and right to
complete the level.
Buy
Three-way or Shotgun
Homing or Nitro
An extra life
Level 2
Still fairly easy. Destroy
the tank in the usual
method and go down the
hatch. Go through the
vents and blast the
machine gunners. Destroy
the conveyor belts and
when you get to the
missile ﬁring tank, go in
the bottom left-hand
corner and blast it from
below. Go down and right
to ﬁnish the level.
Buy
Three-way
Nitro or Shower
An extra life
Level 3
Tricky level this. Go right
until you get to the lift,
then keep jumping up,
using the three-way to
dispose of the
jetpack men.
When you get
to the three
saws, use the
nitro or shower
to dispose of
them. To avoid
them, just stay
in the middle of
the screen and
when they
come down,
jump away and
then back again.
The end of level
baddie is quite simple.
Just blast the saws and
shoot the eye. Keep going
right to exit the level.
Buy
Three-way or Shotgun
Homing Missiles
An extra life
Level 4
Keep going right,
destroying the tanks you
meet, but be prepared for
the jetpackers! Climb up
the ladder and prepare for
a long battle. Use the
homing missiles to
destroy the jets and exit
right.
Buy
Extra
ammo
Homing or
Nitro
Extra life
Level 5
A tough level this. Keep
going left and drop down
the ledge. When the
helicopter appears, use all
your armoury on it and
pray like crazy. Keep
going left and use the
same 'tactics' on the
second helicopter.
To get past the electric
forceﬁeld, just blast the
top and bottom of the
electric beams. Jump the
large gap and kill the
machine-gunner. Go down
and kill the electric man.
Then go back up and
destroy the forceﬁeld,
after which you go right to
complete the level.
Buy
Extra ammo
Homing Missiles
Extra life
Level 6
Easy! Just go right and
when the screen drops,
smeg everything you see.
The screen keeps dropping
and you keep killing.
When you reach the
bottom, just go right and
exit the level.
Buy
Fire or Extra ammo
Nitro or Shower
Extra life
Level 7
Fairly easy, but you do
need 'ﬁre'. Just go right
and waste all the soldiers
you meet. Use the ﬁre and
backpack weapon to
destroy the missile-ﬁring
funnels and the other
'things', and bingo - you've
done it.
Buy
Extra ammo
Homing
Extra life
Level 8
Keep going up, there's lots
of keys to collect so its not
advisable to shoot
someone on a separate
ladder.
The end of level
baddies is very awkward
and homing missiles come
in very useful as close ﬁre.
Buy
Extra ammo
Homing or Nitro
Level 9
Quite tough this. Keep
going right, blasting all
the blocks you see (three-
way is good for this)
before they get a chance
to ﬁre. When you get to
King Crimson (well, his
head anyway), just blast
like crazy and hope for
the best. There, you've
done it, sit back and
watch the end of game
sequence.
The Cheat
If you get killed on any
level, after you've typed in
your high score the
message 'rewind and
press ﬁre' comes up.
Ignore this line and just
press ﬁre. The next level
will then load (this
obviously will not work if
you have a disk drive).

these will be getting a crispy ﬁver
for their efforts.
If there is no SYS number it
means that the pokes are for use
with a cartridge (available from

manufacturers).

WINGERS' CORNER
If you can help any of the following
please send us your tips.
John Boriey is having trouble with
Knightmare (the tip in this ish should
help), all three Dizzys (we printed full
solutions to two of them - Treasure
Island and Fantasy Land - in our
Sept 90 issue), and Strip Poker 2.
M. A. Barrington wonders how to
enter pokes without an SYS
number. It's pretty easy really, you
need a commercial cartridge from
one of the suppliers. In a future
issue we'll look at all those
available, but for now you should
rake through the adverts for the
best one. The same applies to
Michael Bennett Jnr.
James Hannaford is also having
trouble with a Dizzy game,
although this time it's the ﬁrst
one. He can get into the castle,
and past the Wizard, but cannot
complete the game.
Richard Fares is having a little
trouble with Flimbo's Quest, he
can't get past level 6, and needs
a Poke with an SYS number.
Emma Copeman is having big
probs with Frosty the Snowman
and cannot get past the Elf.
We'll be printing full maps and a
playing guide in a future issue,
but up in the poke section
there's one for this excellent
game.
Paul Milburn is looking for a cheat
that works for X-Out. He reckons
the one we printed in December
didn't work due to the C64 not
having an 'ESCAPE' key. There IS
one on the C128, but I don't
suppose that helps much.
Adrian Sharp needs cheats for
Predator (How do you kill the
monster or lift the tree trunk?),
Live and Let Die (Inﬁnite fuel
needed), and Moonwalker (Inﬁnite
disks).
Scott Batts is looking for cheats
for Back to the Future II,
Barbarian, Target Renegade and
Footballer of the Year.
Anthony Phillips would like to
know if there's a poke that works
for Green Beret.

You join us for the ﬁrst heat of this
exciting contest. T h e lights are dim.
The au d ien ce are dim. T h e
contestants are d... No , but
seriously. T h ere will b e  four
qualifying rounds of the contest
from four sections of the software
industry with questions on the kind
of trivia that, until now, has cluttered
only the min d s of the YC staff.
THE CONTESTANTS:
Danielle Woodyatt (US
Gold): "My job is to maintain
a constant corporate image
for the company and its
brands in response to
enquiries from trade, public
and press."
Cathy Campos
(Mirrorsottilmageworks):
"I'm responsible for the
promotion of lots of different
titles' Such as Back to the
Future III and Predator II. In
the course of my job I get to
deal with and take out lots of
interesting joumos like the
YC team."
Tammy Lock (Domark):
"I'm a Marketing Assistant,
Assistant PR Supremo. I
meet lovely joumos like Rik
and go up and down the
country taking them out for
scrummy, expensive
lunches. I also organise nice
compos with games like
Skull + Crossbones and
Hydra which are completely
brilliant!"
Nicki Hemmings (Rainbow
Arts): "I try to get as many
front covers out of joumos
as possible, with no lunches
up front. I want to tell all the
readers to go out and buy
Turrican II which'll give
Robocop ll a run for its
money - and we didn't have
to buy a licence!"
Mike Clarke (Code
Masters): "The Codies say
to me: 'Get close to the
press, Mike, and get them to
write nice things about us.
So, Absolutely brilliant...
Code Masters... Code
Masters... Super-smooth
graphics. Is that OK?"
Daniel Marchant
(Storm): "I do PR, testing
and development
managing. I take journos
out to lunch and that gives
me a good excuse to have
an expensive meal. I like,
where possible, to get my
photo in the press so that
our programmers can
blow it up on the
photocopier and deface
it."

a day or two in front of a
commie and a copy of
Football Director and I'll
be quiet the whole time
(pausing brieﬂy just to
scoff the odd ﬁg roll and
sup my cold tea). And
when something more
original that footy
becomes the subject of
such a game I'm at it like a
shot.
I tell you what, you've
never seen a tape ﬂy into a

Unfortunately I had to wait
for the normal loading time
until the game was there,
up on screen, for my
eagerly awaiting
management skills to
delve into, and delve they
did.
You are the boss of a
Formula One racing team,
the sort of bloke that you
see up in the grand stand
of any racing track with a
fat cigar and an equally fat
build. And to build the
team you get a few offers
from different racing
names and sponsors. As
soon as the game starts
you are offered the type of
car that you'll race, the
engine you'll put in the
cars, the major sponsor
name, the tyre
manufacturer that you'll be
linked to, and other

names that all go to
putting together a winning
set-up. These all give you
I humungous amounts of
cash that you can use at a
later date.
When you get through
to the major option screen
you realise that there's not
really much you can
actually spend your
money on. You've already
been supplied with a crew
(the staff) all of which have
their own individual
percentage ratings, but
you can sack them and
install new people in their
places (with higher
percentage ratings
hopefully). And apart from
betting, investing and
viewing the tables (driver
and franchise) it's onto the
track.
Here you get the
chance to fuel your car
and choose the type of
tyres to use depending on
the weather and really
that's about it, just send
your two drivers out. You
have one qualifying lap to
set your position on the
grid and then it's the main
race. Its here that the
game fails most as you
have to wait about ﬁve
minutes to see the
outcome. The only part of
this that needs you to do
anything is the pitstop
when you've either got
engine trouble, you want
to change your tyres
because the weather's
changed, or you need to
refuel, but the computer
can even do this for you.
That's essentially all
there is to the game. It's
very hooking, but not
necessarily complex
enough for the real
management boffos. If
you're a racing fan you'd
be well chuffed at the
accuracy of the gameplay,
if not it may be best
to stick with the
subject we all know
and love, footy.

A distinctly average management game. It
takes the corners smoothly enough, it just
doesn't have the oomph for the straights.
THE SKORES
NO SKORE - This game is
too abysmal for words.
- It'd probably be
worthwhile using the
cassette to record an
E.M.F. single on or
something.
0 0 -  Not even worth a
look. It's only appeal
would be for amusement.
0 0 0  - This is an average
budgie game, and would
probably ﬁll a gap on a
rainy Sunday afternoon.
0 0 0 0  - This game is
rather splendid really, but
it lacks that certain
something that
determines a 'must buy'.
0 0 0 0 0  - This is the best
you're likely to get for
your pocket money. Well
worth raiding your piggy
bank for.

RUGBY
COACH
CULT E2.99
D&H Games are very well
known for not only the
company's proliﬁc nature
when it comes to sport
simulations (see the
Grand Prix review on
these pages), but 90% of
them are rather stonky
(and pretty accurate). And
out of these most of them
are released for just
under three quidies on
the budget label 'Cult'.
Rugby Coach is yet
another of the
management games that
Cult's so good at,
although this time the
focus is away from footy.
But not that far away,
'cause rugby's the focus
of attention, or more
accurately rugby league
(the difference between
rugby league and rugby
union is the amount of
facial scars boasted
about in the pub
afterwards, and the

First you choose which
team you'd like to
manage, or 'coach' if
we're being picky (we
certainly are - The
Readers), and you do have
the chance to change the
LEUCLIIE t i P T C U  t
names later on. Then you
can choose a skill level
from 1 (easy) and 9 (mega-
stonkingly difﬁcult, so
hard in fact that you could
use it to drill holes in the
road), all of which
determining how devious
and unfeasibly strong the
opposing teams in the
league are.
Then you're presented
with an option screen that
offers you all the features
you need to be able to
choose a championship
and cup (there are two of
them) winning team. You
can offer players on the
transfer market (don't
forget, rugby league
allows transfer fees for
players and is run on a
proﬁt making basis, unlike
union) and similarly buy
others, although you can
only ever have up to 20
players in your team at
one time. Each player has
a level for each of
Strength, Speed, Tackling,
Passing, and Kicking
Abilities, and also has an
overall rating which, unlike
other management games
(footy or otherwise), differs
from player position to
player position.

old days, sitting in my
School library with a set
of the Diplomacy board
game and a few chums.
After about half an hour
we'd set up the board and
another half we'd read the
rules. By the time the ﬁrst
turn had been worked out,
the school bell rung and we
were chucked out by the
scruff of our dodgy jeans
(hahl No school uniform for
the mighty Rik) And,
unfortunately, all further
attempts at playing were
constantly dashed by
somebody's Mum hnging
up half way through, or the
cat had eaten half the
pieces, and to this date
we've never ﬁnished a
whole game.
Thanks to Virgin, and the
Leisure Genius label, we're
ﬁnally treated to the
Mk,
computerisation of the game
of old world domination, and
'treated' is certainly the hght
word for it. Although we
don't really have the space
to go into all the nooks and
crannies of the rules of the
game, here's a rough idea:
You are the ruler of a nation
(England, Austria-Hungary,
Russia, Germany, Turkey,
Italy, or France), or if there
are less players than seven
(the max), generally more
than one. Using your armies
and ﬂeets you have to
essentially take over the
regions (called supply
centres) of each country
(eventually taking over the
entire world).
This can be done using
help from other players by
signing 'treaties' and by
asking for military aid, and
when you do take over a
supply centre you will then

receive a new army or ﬂeet
(growing your forces as you
go). You get several options
to perform before you end
your turn - move troops,
support other troops in
battle, convoy troops across
the water, etc. - and once
over all the turns are
revealed and the outcomes
worked out.
"Now why shouldn't I just
go out and buy the board
game?" I hear you all gob
out in unison! Simple,
because there are no ﬁddly
bits in this box, just a tape or
disk, and the presentation
and options are incredible.

Not the sort of game for shoot-em-up freaks,
but strategists and boardgamers will salivate
—
to seven players, any of
them human or computer
controlled (with the
computer players having
three skill levels), and the
map screens are split up
into standard, troop, and
occupied maps.
Everything is controlled
using easy joystick controls
and the whole package gives
anew, and highly improved,
lease of life to what has been
acclaimed as the best board
game ever. You can forget
the excellent conversion of
Monopoly, Cluedo, Scrabble,
and Risk, Diplomacy .
is the ultimate of
them all.

balanced team), and have
looked at your oppositions
area scores (and seen that
they're very likely to just
come out on the pitch and
continually jump up and
down on your faces),
you'll enter the arena of
operation (as the
Americans would call it if
they saw how violent
rugby really is - not like
their pansy game). It is
here that you realise one
of the few faults of Rugby
Coach as, no matter how
many points my team
decimated the opposition
in area scores, the ﬁnal
outcome is always most
likely to go away from
your team. The other bug

Imagine this, one
Japanese bloke is phoning
up an American, and he
wants to know what the
name of his lovely new

when you accumulate too
good a team and you try
to raise your Forward
rating above 45, it will
decrease all the way to 0,
no matter how good the
players are in that
position.
Rugby Coach isn't the
best management game,
but is typical of the high
standard of budget
simulation games
released by Cult. It offers
a lot of new features and
is very simple, and very
gripping, to play. If it
wasn't for the bugs it
could well have even been
worth a full price tag.

up is created.
Virgin bought the
rights to the machine,
and so a computer game
cock-up was created.
Continental Circus was
never the sort of game,
in the arcades, that was
an ideal choice for
commie conversion, and
it was expressed upon
ﬁrst viewing (having
previously been released
at full price).
There are eight
different race tracks to
race on, but like Pole
Position and thousands
after it, you have to
qualify each time to be
able to progress onto the
next. And that really is
the entire playability in
one. You wave your
badly drawn car sprite
around the badly
scrolling 3D racetrack,
trying to avoid other
badly drawn car sprites,
and racing towards the
badly wobbling
qualifying line. When you
pass it you either qualify
for the next section, or
ﬁnish the race (and you
must be within a certain
race position to qualify
for the next track.
The graphics are
pretty crappy, the sonics
are dire and to be honest
to Virgin Mastertronic,
although the name will
probably have already
sold bucketloads, the
whole thing (in the words
of the immortal Vic
Reeves) is very poo-er,
very poo-er indeed!!!

 ur long missed egg
like friend is back! No,
it's not Humpty
Dumpty or Paul Daniels
without his wig on, it's the
only egg that has developed
arms and legs apart from
Dylan, Denzil, Dozy, Dora,
Daisy and Grand Dizzy. Yes,
you guessed it it's our hero
egg Dizzy with a compilation
made up of the last four
Dizzy games - Fast Food,
Dizzy, Treasure Island Dizzy,
Fantasy World Dizzy and the
brand new Magicland Dizzy.
For any idiot who doesn't
know of Dizzy and his
amazing adventures I won't
bother to explain cos you're
probably too thick to
remember what I tell you. Oh
all right, for those that don't
know, Dizzy is a small egg
shaped character who
usually wonders about in
arcade adventure games
solving puzzles by moving
objects about and avoiding
being fried, squashed, eaten
or any other unfortunate fate.
FAST FOOD
First of all, just to confuse
you, I'll start of with the most
crap game on the
compilation... Fast Food,
which obviously would have
got nowhere without the
name of Dizzy to back it up,
reminds me of some of the
more dated games that I
used to play in my wasted
years on the Acorn Electron
(useless cheaper option to
the BBC Micro). It's a one
screen one level pac-man
type game in which you
control a badly drawn sprite
who is chasing some more
badly drawn sprites and still
more badly drawn sprites are
chasing after you. They all
have various speeds but they
all move slightly faster than
the graphics you sometimes
try make out on teletext.
DIZZY
Evil Zacs' the type of wizard
who turns people old, makes
people blind, and
occasionally makes it rain on
sundays to spoil the cricket.
He sounds almost as bad as
Mrs T does'nt he? But all bad
things must come to an end,
or was the saying all good
things must come to a end?
Who cares. Anyway going
back to the plot after rudely
interrupting myself... Who
has fate chosen to put an
end to this mischief? No, it's
not John major it's you, Dizzy
the wonderful.
In this ﬁrst Dizzy game
(unsurprisingly called Dizzy)
you must help the spinning
egg boy to collect all the
Ingredients of the potion to
dissolve Zacs reign (and it
can be used to cure athletes'
foot). To do so you must

solve many puzzles and
avoid vicious beings who all
are trying to poach you
(these meanies being,
amongst other things,
spiders, birds and ghosts).
This game has reasonable
graphics and is a classic
arcade adventure with an
addictive edge to it.

TREASURE ISLAND
DIZZY
You knew that you should
have used Long John Silver's
spare wooden leg collection
as makeshift stumps to play
cricket, or perhaps you
should have, as now you're
stuck on a Treasure Island.
Although this sounds quite a
good place to be stuck you
may have second thoughts
when you see the well scary
grave stone of Black Heart
the Pirate, you might even
have third thoughts when
you read the scroll that says
he haunts the island. Also
watch out for the dangerous
egg traps in the treehouse.
Treasure Island Dizzy is a
good arcade adventure
game following in the tracks
of the original.
FANTASY WORLD
DIZZY
Fantasy World Dizzy
improves on both Dizzy and
Treasure
Island Dizzy.
You start off
in a dungeon
guarded by a
rather
unfriendly
looking troll
who throws
you back
every time
you try to
walk past him. Luckily there
is a jug of water which can be
chucked on a ﬁre at the other
end of the room creating an
exit. This is just one of the
plethora of puzzles in the
game, for example how do
you get past the snapping
croc in the water? Well, I'm
not telling you you'll have to
ﬁnd out yourself.
There is also a rather
annoying bit of humor. When
I picked up the bottle of
whiskey I decided to go get
the troll drunk so I could get
past the entrance he was
guarding. Little did I know
Dizzy was an alcoholic as he
refused to put the bottle
down when I told him to,
even worse he drank it.
Needless to say Dizzy is not
very controllable when he is
drunk. He walks without your
command and will
sometimes move in opposite
directions to which you tell
him.
This Dizzy game is the
second best on the
collection,the puzzles are
done well and the graphics
are slightly better than
Dizzy's and Treasure Island
Dizzy's. The only minor bad
point of all the Dizzy games
so far is that if you were to do
something as easily done as
touching a ﬁre or a creature
you will die
instantly.
MAGICLAND
DIZZY
Now ifs the
brand new game
for our alcoholic egg, who
was yearning for a new
adventure and perhaps even
more free whiskey. What he
didn't realise was that Zacs
was alive and kicking, and
hatching (geddit?) a new plan
in his evil ways. This time the
evil ﬁend has turned all your
friends into strange and
weird objects and creatures,
and you must seek them out
and return them to their
normal situations.
Magicland Dizzy is the
best Dizzy game so far. It
has picked up on the bad
points of the others and
improved itself. M.L.D. is the
ﬁrst Dizzy game to have
energy (making the game so
much more playable), so you
won't die on your ﬁrst slip
up, unless you fall into a
pool of water in which you'll
obviously
drown. As you
travel through
Magic Land
you'll meet
many weird and
wonderful
beings
including The
Queen of
Hearts, Prince Charming,
Cheeky Monkeys, Giant
Trolls, Game Genies,
Excalibur, Creepy Ghosts,
Sharks, Huge Rats,
Volcanoes, Hades, the Good
Witch Glenda, Monoliths,
Weirdhenge, Vampira -
Zacs' evil step mother and
many more. The puzzles are
well thought out and the
graphics are better
than all the other
Dizzy games.

C
violent fellow that
Predator guy must
be. Imagine running
around gutting people and
pulling their spines out
through the top of their
heads, I mean you'd have
to be in the SAS to do that
legally - oh dear, dodgy
ground. If I don't watch
myself I'll probably end up
as dead as a... BANG...
Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
Two months in
intensive care later - Erm.„
Hello, mind if I don't laugh
I may rip my spleen again.
And could you pass that
bottle of Lucozade over,
I've got a lovely plastic
cup beside my bed. Now
where was I? Oh yes, the
Predator.
When the ﬁrst
movie came
out I missed
it in the
cinema,
but due to
the
wonderful
technology
we call
'video' I
managed to
catch it on its
release for the home
market and was I
impressed? (We don't
know, tell us - The
Readers). Er, yes I was!!!
And if I've got this right
this Predator fellow was a
hunter in the mega sense
of the word. He chugged
around the galaxy
occasionally stopping on a
planet and smegging
certain members of the
population (those who are
worthy opponents), and in
this instance he decided
to stop off on Earth -
heaven knows why, he
probably just fancied what
is paramount to a bit of
clay pigeon shooting on
his way to Beta Minor 5
where he'd ﬁnd the ﬁve
legged, ten armed nasty
beast they call the "Milval
Zupporter" - and this is
where he met his match
and promptly got a severe
twatting by Arnie (the big
Schwartz).
Now a younger version
has heard about the planet
that managed to nuke one
of his kind, so he decides
to indulge in a spot of
"tally ho", "pip, pip" and
"let's bag that fellow foxy,
so we can get home for
some crumpets and
butter!" And this is the
setting for the second
movie, and therefore the
commie 64 version care of
Imageworks.
As Dutch (the character
played by Arnie in the ﬁrst
ﬁlm) was on holiday (or
something) the action is all
revolved around a guy
called Detective
Lieutenant Harrigan, who's
based in the city of Los
Angeles in the year 1997.
Now this city is currently
going through an
incredible heatwave and
add to that a plethora of
drug barons and their
teenage minions, and an

• SPESti
1
unseen killer in the form of
an alien presence and
we're talking mega-
deathsville.
The game takes four
major action sequences as
its focus, and
subsequently divides them
and provides them as four
different levels. The
gameplay is reminiscent of
such arcade greats as
Operation Wolf, but if you
remember we've never
(not even once) had a
decent one of them on the
commie (even the ofﬁcial
conversion was naff), and
it's immediately apparent
that Predator 2 oozes
quality.
When you start the ﬁrst
level (and the game) you
are plunged into a
supposedly routine drugs
bust, and you must
progress along a scrolling
horizon, blasting all the
nasties using your gun
sight and occasionally
spanking the closer ones
with the butt of your gun.
If you get shot you will
lose energy. If you shoot
innocent people (like the
fat women who run across
the screen) your badge will
be depleted. And if either
of these hit their low
points it'll be the end of
the game for you, and
you'll have to use one of
the 2 continues that you
begin the game with
(giving you, in effect, 3
lives).
You also start the
game with just a Magnum
which, although it has
inﬁnite bullets, is a bit
crap when all's said and
done. Along the way, and
hidden in bins, crates, and
hanging baskets, are extra
weapons and ammo, and
every-so-often there'll be
some body armour along -
allowing you to take more
hits. But what makes
Predator 2 that much
more special than
anything else in this ilk is
(obviously) the Predator.
One problem
Imageworks has had in
converting the movie is
that 20th Century Fox has
demanded that the game
plot is identical to the
ﬁlm's. Due to this, we
don't see the Predator
properly until the third
level. Fortunately he is in
the ﬁrst two, but only in
his invisible mode, and
he'll not bother you unless
you accidentally shoot
him. In fact he'll help you
murder those drug
pushers as efﬁciently as a
Rotweiler with rabies.
At the end of each level
is an 'end-of-level' meany
(alien or otherwise), and
you'll need mega amounts
of ﬁre power just to
sneeze in his general
direction. The four levels
are all quite large, but the

ﬁrst is absolutely huge (at
least twice the size of the
others), and to be able to
complete such a
humungeous task you'll
have to have; a) a ﬂaming
good joystick; b) lightning
reactions; and c) tonnes
of time on your hands.
The graphics are
yummy (especially the bit
where the Predator pulls
the druggies heads off)
and the sound is on par
with most shoot-em-ups.
Although the garneplay is,
to be honest, unoriginal I
think it can be safely
assumed that the options
make it a hell of a lot
better than any others in
the genre (like the way
you can shoot the lights
out in the subway - level
3).
As soon as Predator 2
is released (at the same
time as the movie) you'll
be guaranteed that well
be down in the shops
'hunting' out a copy
(Groan).
Predator 2 - The Movie will be
on nationwide release from
the 4th of May, and stars
Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon
I & II). He plays Detective
Lieutenant Harrigan, but those
under 18 will not be able to
catch his exploits due to its
certiﬁcate.

something about
confrontations
between good and evil
that bring out the
biblical in me. Maybe
it's the echoes of the
conﬂict at the core of a
man's heart, perhaps
it's a race memory of
times gone by, and yet
mayhap this is all silly
wafﬂe and I should
stick to tarmacking
roads. Whatever, good
versus evil is on the
menu tonight, as the
son o f Satan and
Satan's daughter,
known as Acarnantor
move into a quiet little
land called Belorn, and
sets ﬁre to their oil
wells. Sorry, different
evil invading different
country. Acamantor
does make life
unpleasant in Belorn
though, unless you
enjoy being cruciﬁed
and left for the birds
that is. Our mate
Acamantor likes nothing
better than wholesale
slaughter at the
weekend, so after a
particularly satisfying
bout of genocide he
summons four dark and
powerful princesses of
hell and gets them to
guard his towers.
Your job is, naturally,
to enter the towers,
defeat all four princess
and then give
Acamantor his come
uppance. Though if you
have any sense you'll
pack your bags and
head for the coast
instead.
The warlock stands
between two towers. In
the one to the left are

of the game Druid,

the right are a new set
of eight levels. Ah yes,
you were thinking that
you'd seen this game
before. You have, and
was called Druid. To be
honest I think Millenium
giving you the same
game but with another
eight levels and
dressing it up as a new
game is a bit of cheek.
Thankfully it was a
good game in the ﬁrst
place, though it looks a
bit dated now, so if you
bear this in mind you
won't be disappointed.
Warlock (or Druid
Plus) is a top down,
Gauntlet style arcade
adventure, with you as
a wizard casting spells
aplenty to fend off the
attention of hordes of
monsters. Keys and
potions all need to be
collected and used to
penetrate the inner
sanctum of the towers,
plus prodigious use of
magic. There are variety
of spells on offer, the
most useful of which is
where you create a
Golem.
Now, if you're
playing with a friend,
then they can play the
golem, otherwise the
computer handles it.
This thing plods around
killing and protecting
on your behalf, leaving
you free to continue
unmolested.
Graphically this is
nothing special, but it
works well enough,
even though the top
down view has gone out
of fashion somewhat.
It all moves well
enough though, is
moderately colourful,
and the new levels offer
many a ﬁendish
surprise. And that is
half the problem. If you
bought the original
game there isn't enough
to make you buy this
'cos it ain't that good a
game system. If, of
course, you've never
played Druid then you
should cancel all leave
and prepare for a
battle with evil
forces.

P+P
Actually, we are very
fortunate that River
Software have any C64
adventures on offer at
all. It wasn't so long
ago that River decided
to withdraw all C64
adventures due to the
poor demand. All
production efforts were
then ploughed into the
Spectrum (spit).
However, River's main
man, Jack Lockerby,
took pity upon us
Commies and not only
decided to re-release
his C64 adventure
catalogue (which will be
featured in a later
issue) but, also , to
release a new text-only
adventure, Into the
Mystic.
Make yourself comfy
and I'll spin you some
plotlines.
"Where has all the
magic gone?" and,
"Without magic our
lives are empty and
void", were typical of
the cries to be heard
throughout the
countryside. Magic was
a handy thing to have
around - and it relieved
the boredom of a long
day in the ﬁeld. Lose
something and you
must ﬁnd it. Hence you
have been nominated,
by Merlin (who else?),
to ﬁnd out what the
Sam Hill is going on
and where all the magic
has gone to.
So off you trotted.
Now Orcs are a pain
in the armpit. Ratty
y'know. Mean too. Oh,
and they have a thing
about tearing people
limb from limb. But, hey
- nobody's perfect,
right? However, Orcs
were the problem just
now. In fact they were
in hot pursuit, chasing
you through the forest.
Luckily you're pretty
fast so it was no
surprise when you lost
the group around by the
old fort. After resting
from the chase you
awake the next morning
to ﬁnd the Orcs
blocking your escape

route! What to do?
Hmmm.
After the introduction
and a short list of
usable verbs the game
begins. Displayed with,
largely, black text on a
green background Into
the Mystic (ITM) uses
succinct location
descriptions with a
restricted use of the
EXAMine command.
That is, only where it is
necessary to forward
the plot or add
essential atmosphere.
The principle feature
of ITM is the puzzle
quality which is, on the
whole, very high. There
are one or two real
brain teasers in there. I
especially enjoyed the
ﬁrst puzzle which is
quite logical. Although
you are given subtle
clues the solution
remains obscure
enough to drive you
crazy. The eventual
solution to the problem
is quite intricate, yet
very enjoyable.
Technically, the
game is not the most
-

advanced adventure I
have ever played.
Although you have a
handy X command to
replace the EXAMINE
command you cannot
link commands via AND
or punctuation.
However, Jack
Lockerby is not known
for his technical
achievments. Instead,
he has a well deserved
reputation for
producing well
designed, very playable
adventures that you can
guarantee will provide a
hours of enjoyment.
Into the Mystic is a very
good example, doubly
so at this price. One
ﬁnal note. Jack has
used the Freeze
Machine cartridge to
store his adventure on
to disk. This means that
you load the adventure
from a menu which then
loads the game much°
pronto. Any prospective
adventure authors
reading should take
note of Jack's good
sense as there is
nothing so frustrating
as a slow loading disk
game.

adventuring, the like of
which has been missing
from the shelves of the
homebrew adventure
author for too long. Gil
gets down to the nitty
gritty of just what
constitutes an
adventure. What is
required, what are the
ingredients to a
successful adventure,
how to integrate the
design elements, etc.
The 128-pages are
divided up into 11
chapters with a number
of appendices. The
contents cover the
eternal question - how
do you want to present
your game. Text or
graphics? How to
obtain your ideas are
then covered. A number
of plot elements are
then discussed such as
puzzles, weapons,
riddles, how objects
can be used to hide
other objects, mazes
and so on. The next
chapter discusses
characters and their
actions. Following that
is a chapter on
developing and testing
Al. VE 
R
- The Sr re A
[ a  a m a z e
your game.
Gil gives good
advice on basic graphic
design (perspective,
composition, etc) as
well as making the
adventure more
atmospheric by
including incidental
messages, even if they
have no bearing on the
actual solution. T h e
style of images, text
and sound is debated
after which various
game systems are
compared. A chapter on
how to publish your
game talks about copy-
protection (without the
expense), publishing
your own work, going to
an outside publisher
and utilising cheat
protection. After a more
detailed look at the
components that form
an adventure game Gil
gives a sample
transcript of one of his
own adventures,
produced with an
American shareware
adventure creation
utility called AGT
(Adventure Game
Tool kit).
The appendices
include lots of useful
reference material such
as a list of utilities and
a bibliography. There's
a handy index at the
back, too.
The Secret Art is a
compact book packed
with valuable advice
which will be of interest
to the adventure player
but absolutely priceless
to the adventure author.
Readable and funny
enough to tickle the
funny bone, The Secret
Art is excellent value
for money.

BARD'S
TALE 3 -
INTERPLAY
Inside the Ice Keep
you'll ﬁnd a slab on the
ﬂoor which can only be
opened by possessing
three lenses. I tried a
credit card but it didn't
work. The lenses can be
found in the three
towers, each blocked by
powerful magic wards
which must be
dispelled. Check out the
diary in the hut. Apart
from giving you a
thorough lowdown on
Skara Brae's bank
holidays and when
Tarjan, the Mad God,
has his ofﬁcial birthday,
it'll also give you a few
hints on how to dispel
the wards. The
inscriptions on the walls
next to the wards are
also hints. Obscure, but
hints all the same.
CURSE OF

Probably the best order
for removing the bonds
is Tilverton (ﬁre knives),
Yulash (moander),
Haptooth (dracanros),
Zhentil Keep
(Fzoul/Beholder) and
Myth Drandor
(Tyranthraxus). In

Thieves Guild before
nipping into the sewers.
Similarly for the Fire
Knives hideout. In the
Red Tower you don't
have to ﬁght the
dragons. Be nice to
them - well, all they get
is hassle, everyone
needs a little love
sometime. Visit the
elven queen in Myth
Drandor. She's in the
crypt (don't ask). Keep
an eye out for
Rakshasa - the vagrant
is in disguise. Buy a
couple of magic missile
wands from Zhentil
Keep then enter Yu lash
- avoid encounters,
initially but ﬁght the
shambling mounds by
the cleric's body.
DRAGON
WARS -
INTERPLAY
If you must start with
a new team take a
look at the pre-
generated lot. They
have been carefully
selected with well
implemented skill
selection. Take
note. For
goodness sake
do not, what ever
you do, transfer
characters from
old Bard's Tale
character disks.
They will always
be worse off in
the new Dragon
Wars scenario
THE MAGIC
CANDLE -
MINDCRAFT
Would I be waxing
lyrical if I suggested
that you take two
wizards and as many
chaps with money-
making professions as
possible? Probably. But
would I risk getting on
your wick if I then
added that you should
have your hunter hunt in
the outdoors to
increase his skill which
will cut down dungeon
ambushes? Yes? Hmm.
What if I offered to quit
with the candle puns?
Right - next!

leaving him till later on
in the game. You'll need
the heavy duty Black &

be vanquished, so just
back off, OK?

be a bit a humdinger. To

leave the cookie. Keep
an eye open for rabbit
traps too. There are
three of the blighters.
Once each character has
joined your party at this
time make sure you have
a quick chat with them.
As for horrible Devourer,
don't bother laying on
the GBH as the guy is
tough. In fact don't start
to ﬁght this unseemly
character as you'll never
get out alive. Flip
through the spell book
instead, something may
be of use.

The phone will ring three
times with three
messages, which may
provide clues. However,
following the above
solution exactly means
you will only hear the
phone ring once. To hear
all three messages, keep
playing and exploring until
just after 3:00 on your
watch. (Enter TIME to read
the watch.) Beware,
though, for if the phone
isn't answered after ten
hngs, it'll stop and you'll
lose that particular call.
Don't spend too long
though after the third call,
as by lea-time' your Mum
and Dad will return and the
game is over. Note that
whilst playing, certain
actions are only necessary
to score the full 100°,/0 and
not to solve the game.
USEFUL VERBS:
