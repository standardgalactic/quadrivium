About the Author
Mark Martin has been racing all his life . . . well, practically. Mark began his
professional racing career in the 1970s in the American Speed Association,
where he was a four-time ASA champion. He successfully made the transition
into the NASCAR scene in 1981 and has been racking up series points ever
since. Since 1988, he has won 33 races, fourth among active NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup drivers. He is considered by many to be the greatest active NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series driver without a championship. Martin’s second-place
finish in 2002 marked the fourth time he has finished second in the final
NASCAR Cup Series point standings. Mark has finished in the top eight in
13 of the last 15 seasons. Mark also has a record four International Race of
Champions (IROC) titles to his credit and is the winningest driver in the
NASCAR Busch Series, with 45 wins. In 2004, he started his 600th career Cup
race in Phoenix, the seventh longest streak in NASCAR history. Off the track,
Martin owns Mark Martin Performance, a company that sells quarter-midget
racing chassis like the one his son, Matt, races in. He also helped build a
quarter-midget track in New Smyrna, Florida.
He lives in Florida with his wife, Arlene, and son, Matt.
Beth Tuschak is a freelance writer associated with NASCAR and has been
invaluable in updating this second edition of NASCAR For Dummies. A syndi-
cated columnist for NASCARMEDIA.com, she also writes freelance stories from
her home in Concord, North Carolina.


About NASCAR
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), organized in
1947 by Bill France, Sr., is America’s premier motorsports and entertainment
sanctioning body. NASCAR is guided by the third generation of the France
family. Brian Z. France took the helm as Chairman of the Board and CEO in
October 2003. Mr. France’s father, Bill France, Jr., led NASCAR during a period
of astounding growth since January 1972. NASCAR’s best-known and most
popular series is the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. NEXTEL became the series’
primary sponsor in 2004. Other top national series include the NASCAR Busch
Series and the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. These marquee divisions are
well-known to the millions of fans who attend these events and to the millions
more who watch events on television. NASCAR also sanctions nine other
regional touring series, as well as the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series.
New to 2004, the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup season features the Chase for the
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup. In this new format, the top 10 drivers in points after
the 26th race are assigned new point standings and compete for the champi-
onship in the last ten races of the season.
NASCAR has become a recognized leader in the entertainment industry, 
with NASCAR Online (www.nascar.com), NASCAR Café restaurants, NASCAR
Speed Parks, and NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway.

Introduction
M
ost of the time, people group NASCAR racing into one of two cate-
gories. It’s a sport that’s too simple because the cars just go around in
circles. Or it’s a sport that’s too technical because it’s centered on engines,
aerodynamics, and the physics of going fast. This book, however, shows you
that NASCAR racing is really both of these things: It’s simple in some ways
but complicated in others. That’s what makes it so fun.
At first the simplicity draws you in. You find that out when you go to a race —
even if you close your eyes. When you sit in the grandstands, you can hear
the cars roar by. You can feel the tremendous power of the engines when the
stands shake, your seat vibrates, and your guts rumble. Then you can smell
the distinct odor of burned rubber that hovers above the racetrack. NASCAR
racing is a total body experience; you don’t even have to see the cars — much
less understand the inner workings of race cars — to get a thrill from racing.
If that’s true, though, why read this book? Even though sitting in the stands
with your eyes closed is entertaining, sitting there with an insider’s view of the
sport, including the technical side, enriches your experience so much more.
You know what’s going on when NASCAR officials give a driver a 15-second
penalty. You won’t be lost when the cars line up single file for a restart — and
you’ll know what a restart is! And a day later, you’ll be able to hang out at the
water cooler and talk to your co-workers with authority about the race. My
job is to share with you all that a fan needs to know about NASCAR racing.
That way, you can enjoy the sport as much as I do.
About This Book
I learned how to drive when I was just five years old, even before I could reach
the pedals of a car. My dad propped me up in his lap, gave me the wheel, and
then smashed his foot on the gas. From then on, I was hooked. I started to
drive a race car at 15, even before I had a driver’s license, and I woke up think-
ing about racing and went to sleep dreaming about racing. And in my spare
time, I worked on and raced cars. It’s no wonder the sport is such a big part
of my life.

Sometimes, though, it’s difficult to explain why NASCAR racing is so addic-
tive, particularly to people who’ve never driven a race car and competed
bumper-to-bumper at breakneck speeds. It’s not like basketball, baseball,
football, or other sports you play during recess in grade school.
I decided that the best way to explain my love for NASCAR racing wasn’t 
by sticking fans in a race car and making them drive laps around Daytona
International Speedway. It was by writing this book. If you can’t discover
the beauty of this sport by doing — and riding down the highway going
80 mph in your Honda Accord doesn’t count — you may as well discover 
it by reading.
If you’re a novice to NASCAR, I help you with the basics of the sport — the
differences between the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and the NASCAR Busch
Series — so you can build upon your NASCAR knowledge from there. If you’re
more advanced, I share the subtleties of the sport so that you can sound like
an old pro. No matter what level of NASCAR knowledge you have, you can
find something new in the pages of this book — I believe it’s the most com-
prehensive book available: I talk about NASCAR’s origin, sponsors, engines,
race teams, race strategies, pit stops, racetracks, and all you need to know 
if you want to be the quintessential NASCAR fan — and that’s just the begin-
ning. My goal is for you to understand everything you see when you watch 
a race and be able to converse and debate intelligently with the most ardent,
well-informed NASCAR fans.
I hope that, in reading this book, you’ll understand why NASCAR racing is my
passion. Maybe it’ll become your passion, too.
Foolish Assumptions
Even though this is a For Dummies book, I don’t assume that you’re a fool.
You’re just trying to find out more about NASCAR racing so that you can
enjoy the sport, as millions of people already do. Maybe you’re a sports fan
who’s curious about racing. Maybe you’re an avid race fan who wants to
brush up on a few things. Maybe you’re my mom who wants to read my book
to boost my ego.
Maybe you just want the answers to some of these questions:
 Why does some guy stand above the track and wave all those flags? Is he
telling the drivers something or part of an off-beat rhythmic gymnastics
team?
 What is a restrictor-plate track and what’s being restricted?
 Does it really matter where a driver qualifies for a race?
2
NASCAR For Dummies, 2nd Edition

 Why do drivers have short tempers at short tracks?
 Are drivers athletes?
 Why are tires such a big deal during a race?
 Why doesn’t a regular Chevrolet Monte Carlo at a local dealership look
like the one Jeff Gordon drives?
 Who are the sponsors and why do race teams need them?
In this book, I answer these questions and more.
How This Book Is Organized
This book isn’t just a few hundred pages of statistics and scintillating com-
mentary. It’s broken into six parts to be user-friendly. Each part deals with a
major aspect of NASCAR racing and the parts are organized so you can find
out more about the sport in a simple, painless manner. Each chapter within
the part dissects a specific detail of the sport — such as qualifying, the race-
tracks, or different NASCAR series. Feel free to skip to the parts and chapters
that interest you most.
Part I: NASCAR 101
If you’ve never seen NASCAR racing or only glanced at a race once or twice
while flipping through the channels on your TV, you’re probably wondering
what all the hubbub is about. Why is NASCAR racing the nation’s fastest
growing sport? What is the allure? Why do I see the drivers on different
cereal boxes or soda bottles every time I go to the supermarket? Is there a
NASCAR invasion no one told me about? In this part, I reveal the mystery
behind the boom of NASCAR racing.
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing?
I drive a Ford Taurus and make it go nearly 200 mph at some racetracks. I’m
sure a few NASCAR fans wonder why their Taurus can’t do the same thing. In
this part, I tell you not only why your Taurus can’t go that fast — besides the
fact that the speed limits don’t allow it — but also why yours has four doors
while my Taurus doesn’t have any. This is perhaps the most technical part 
of the book, detailing the race cars, the race teams, and many of the rules. 
It gets down to the nitty-gritty, which can help even the most avid NASCAR 
fan feel just a little more like a pro when tuning into a race or going to the
racetrack.

Introduction

Part III: What Happens 
on (and off) the Track
Sometimes NASCAR drivers do strange things. They come in for pit stops 
and opt for just a splash-and-go. They draft behind other drivers on super-
speedways with carburetor restrictor plates in their engines. They wear
funny shoes. In this part, I decipher and explain racing itself, staying safe, and 
winning an event. No longer will you be perplexed when a driver talks about
racing for championship points or doing the hat dance. The chapters in this
part help you follow every word of racing jargon — and there’s plenty of that
to go around. NASCAR racing is its own world, and in this part, I invite you in
and teach you about the native customs.
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events
There’s nothing worse than showing up at a NASCAR race in a hoop skirt and
a bonnet. In this part, I tell you how to fit in at the racetrack by dressing like a
NASCAR fan, talking like a NASCAR fan, watching a race like a NASCAR fan,
and following NASCAR like a NASCAR fan.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you don’t have time to get drawn in by an entire chapter, the Part of Tens is
perfect for you. In this part, you can find little morsels of information, pack-
aged into neat, manageable (and short) chapters about NASCAR’s all-time
greatest drivers, the best NASCAR races, and future NASCAR stars. The lists
aren’t definitive so you can debate about it with your friends, but I picked my
favorites.
Part VI: Appendixes
In NASCAR racing, people talk in NASCAR language — which isn’t at all simi-
lar to the conversational French or obsolete Latin you studied in high school.
It’s a unique language used in racing circles and you can find a big chunk of it
in Appendix A. They’re all the racing terms you’ll need to know.
The other appendixes list NASCAR statistics and key NASCAR milestones.
It’s trivia you should know if you’re planning to be a contestant on Jeopardy!
sometime soon.

Icons Used in This Book
To make things easier, I use icons — little pictures in the margins — to high-
light important information: giving you advice, a warning, or knowledge in
order to impress friends at dinner parties.
This icon points out information that helps you save time, money, and effort.
If you know these words, you won’t seem like an accountant among a group
of rock stars when you’re in a conversation with die-hard NASCAR fans.
Take heed when you see this caution flag. Its goal is to save you from losing
money, getting hurt, or exposing yourself to other dangers.
When you see one of these icons, you’ll know you’re about to read a story
from my years of NASCAR racing experience.
This information is for the real geeky fans who want to know all the details,
no matter how complex. Non-geeks can skip these icons.
Where to Go from Here
You know when you’re reading a great book and you’re dying to get to the
last chapter because you can’t stand the suspense? Well, in this book you
can. It won’t ruin the story for you — because there is no story. There isn’t
a beginning, middle, or end, so just flip to the last chapter and read it first if
you want. Go ahead. Your high school English teacher isn’t looking. Actually,
you can turn to any chapter and read it. There’s nothing to be ashamed of
because that’s the way I’ve designed the book. Every chapter is written to
stand alone and provide information about NASCAR’s nuances. The Table
of Contents and the Index list what’s in this potpourri of NASCAR racing, so
choose where you want to begin your journey — then have fun!

ASCAR racing is everywhere nowadays: Races are on
TV, racetracks are in nearly every part of the country,
and drivers have their pictures on cereal boxes and bill-
boards. If you’re new to NASCAR, you may be perplexed
by this invasion, so in this part I reveal the mysteries of
NASCAR racing and tell you why so many fans are flocking
to the sport. I also answer all your questions about corpo-
rate involvement in the sport and why at times it seems as
if NASCAR is one big, uninterrupted commercial for motor
oil, beer, and laundry detergent.
I also describe each NASCAR series so that you can tell
the difference between the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series,
the NASCAR Busch Series, and the NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series. You also find out that the NASCAR Featherlite
Modified Series isn’t racing’s version of a boxing division. 
If your dream is to be more than just a fan of the sport, I
can help you out in that department, too. This part gives
you a few hints on how to become a race car driver or get
a job on a NASCAR crew.

ost people don’t know what it’s like to dunk a basketball or hit a 100-
mph fastball 500 feet for a home run, but almost everyone knows how
to drive a car — and that familiarity is the appeal of NASCAR and stock-car
racing. Whether they admit it or not, lots of people speed down the highway
and daydream about winning the Daytona 500. That daydreamer could be a
17-year-old high school student who just got a driver’s license, a 35-year-old
orthodontist, or a 70-year-old retired teacher. Driving is nearly universal.
NASCAR’s allure has grown in recent years because of its tremendous televi-
sion exposure; the drivers’ accessibility to their fans; and close, competitive
racing. In 2003, nearly 7 million fans went to see the NASCAR Cup Series races,
which is quadruple the attendance in 1980. And more than 280 million viewers
tuned into NASCAR Cup Series events on television in 2003, making NASCAR
one of the most popular sports to watch on TV, second only to the NFL.
Here are a few more stats that show how NASCAR has grown from an origi-
nally Southern-based sport to a truly national phenomenon:
 #1 sport in brand loyalty of fans
 #2 rated sport on television
 Over $2 billion in licensed sales
 75 million fans

If you’re one of the sport’s new fans, this chapter gives you NASCAR in a nut-
shell, including enough details about its history, cars, drivers, teams, races,
and statistics to make you sound like a veteran. If you’re an old hand, you can
brush up on what’s new, as the sport is constantly evolving.
From Back Roads to the Big Time
A few decades ago, stock-car races weren’t the professionally run events that
they are now, even though many organizations — including the United Stock
Car Racing Association, the Stock Car Auto Racing Society, and the National
Championship Stock Car Circuit — sanctioned races. The schedule wasn’t
organized; instead, random races were held here and there, sprinkled through-
out the southeastern United States wherever tracks were available (some were
well-built, but most were pretty shoddy). Drivers didn’t race in each event, so
fans had no idea which of their favorites would show up until they got to the
10
Part I: NASCAR 101 
The first NASCAR race
In February 1948, two months after NASCAR
was founded, more than 14,000 people showed
up at a race course just south of Daytona
Beach. The 150-mile event was held on a unique
track that was half on the beach and half on the
highway behind the sand, making it interesting
for drivers and spectators alike, particularly
when the tide came in and the beach narrowed.
Red Byron, a driver from Anniston, Alabama,
whose left leg was injured when his bomber
was shot down in World War II, won that first
NASCAR-sanctioned race, enhancing his repu-
tation as one of NASCAR’s greatest early dri-
vers. It also made him the answer to a common
NASCAR trivia question: “Who won the first
NASCAR race?” 
Red Byron also won NASCAR’s first Strictly
Stock championship. This series — the fore-
runner of today’s NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series,
debuted in 1949 and was limited to full-sized
American production, or “stock” cars. The first
Strictly Stock race was held in June 1949, and
anyone with a car was eligible to race. And I
mean anyone — people who had never raced
before made the trip to the .75-mile dirt track in
Charlotte, North Carolina, to see how they could
do. All they needed was a car and a fair amount
of guts.
The cars were plain vehicles like Buicks, Fords,
and Lincolns, not like today’s race cars, which
are built from the ground up by multi-million-
dollar teams and tuned specifically for racing. If
drivers wanted to race back then, they could
drive the family car right onto the track! Of
course, if a driver crashed and destroyed his
car, he could be stranded. Hitchhiking home
was not out of the realm of possibility.
S

track. Worse, some race promoters were less than honest, running off with the
ticket receipts and race purses, never to be seen again. 
Bill France, Sr., a tall, dynamic stock-car driver and race promoter, thought
this was an unprofessional way to run a sport and was determined to set a
standard for drivers and track owners. He decided to devote his energy to
establishing one preeminent stock-car racing sanctioning body — NASCAR
(National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) — that would oversee differ-
ent series. A racing series, such as the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, is similar
to a baseball league, featuring a group of drivers who compete in a set number
of events and follow rules determined by the sanctioning body. At the end of
the season, the sanctioning body in charge of making the rules, running the
events, and making sure competitors follow the rules, crowns a series cham-
pion. That’s exactly what France, also known as “Big Bill,” created with his
brainchild — NASCAR. In the beginning, France had several goals:
 Racetracks that were safe for the drivers, and track owners who
repaired their facilities between races. If a car crashed into or through
a guard rail, it would have to be repaired by the track owner before the
next race.
 Rules that wouldn’t change from week to week or race to race. Before
NASCAR was organized, different tracks had different rules, which drove
drivers to distraction. Some even had quirky on-track rules, made up the
morning of a race by a promoter seeking to make things more exciting.
Because of these inconsistencies, drivers didn’t know what to expect
when they showed up at a racetrack. These days, rules still occasion-
ally change but are often studied for a period of months before being 
implemented.
 A set schedule allowing the same drivers to compete against one
another each week. This way, a single national champion recognized
by all could be crowned at the end of the year.
 A uniform point system to calculate which driver performed the best
throughout the season. Drivers would earn points according to how they
finished in a race, with the winner receiving the most points and the last-
place driver getting the least. With a points system like that, the series
could crown a definitive champion instead of having many “national cham-
pions” crowned at different tracks or in different, smaller series. Having
just one national champion made winning the title something special.
 An insurance and benevolent fund: This was meant to give the drivers
something to fall back on in case they got hurt or couldn’t compete due
to injuries.
11
Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around

France’s goals were realized and today NASCAR sanctions several racing
series. The top one is the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, and I spend most of
the book talking about this series. I give you a quick rundown on the NASCAR
Busch Series, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and several NASCAR tour-
ing series in Chapter 3.
What Is Stock Car Racing?
When different people think of auto racing, the same image of a race car
doesn’t necessarily pop into their heads. That’s because many different types
of race cars and hundreds of racing series, or racing leagues, exist throughout
the world. 
NASCAR stock cars are unique in that they look very much like what a subur-
banite drives. But looks can be deceiving. Almost nothing is “stock” when it
comes to NASCAR vehicles, whether they run in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series,
NASCAR Busch Series, or NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series events. In addition
to bodies (or chassis) reinforced with roll bars, multi-part driver restraint
systems, and an escape hatch through the roof, NASCAR vehicles are among
the fastest — and safest — on earth.
Three brands of cars compete in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series — the
Chevrolet Monte Carlo, the Ford Taurus, and the Dodge Intrepid. The manu-
facturers of these brands of cars see the sport as a great marketing tool,
hence the saying, “Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.”
Here’s a quick rundown on the other types of racing vehicles (Figure 1-1
shows you some of the differences):
 Open-wheel: The cars that run in the Indianapolis 500, perhaps the most
famous race in the world, are open-wheel cars. They’re agile, lightweight
racing cars with an open cockpit. Open-wheel cars also have no fenders,
so they can’t bump and bang as stock cars do or they would crash. The
three different leagues that use open-wheel cars are
• Formula One: The world’s best-known open-wheel series.
• Indy Racing League (IRL): Which competes exclusively on oval
tracks in the United States and features the Indy 500 on its yearly
schedule. The IRL plans to add road courses in the near future.
• Champ Cars (formerly CART): This series races in various coun-
tries but mostly the United States on road courses and ovals.
 Dragsters: Speedsters that race a short distance in a short period of
time. They race in pairs on a straight, flat quarter-mile strip of asphalt 
12
Part I: NASCAR 101 

or concrete. The fastest ones can go from 0 to 100 mph in less than one
second, topping out at speeds in excess of 320 mph. The premier drag-
sters are called Top Fuel cars, which are specialized cars that look more
like rocket ships than anything else. They have long, tapered noses with
two small front tires. The driver sits in an open cockpit about ten feet
behind the wheels, with the engine behind him or her. Other dragsters
are a little less exotic: Funny cars are highly modified, jazzed-up stock
cars, while Street Stock cars look like passenger cars.
 Sports cars: Most are production (sports) cars with highly specialized
engines, but the fastest are open-cockpit cars that sit close to the ground
(like Ferraris). The cars are prototypes, which means they are built
specifically for racing and aren’t sold to the public.

Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around

The Racing Team
One of the best aspects of NASCAR is that its drivers are regular people —
that is, until they get to the race track. As is the case with all competitive 
athletes, NASCAR drivers have their own personalities, which are often mag-
nified when they get behind the wheel. The legendary Richard Petty, whose
200-victory record will probably never be topped (he raced up to 60 times a
season) is one of the nicest guys in the garage area, always stopping to sign
autographs while flashing his signature smile. But Petty didn’t win seven
NASCAR Cup championships by being the series’ sweetheart during a race;
he bumped and banged with the best of them.
Drivers like Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon prefer their on-track perfor-
mance to talking, while the colorful Rusty Wallace has never been asked a
question that he answered in less than 300 words. These days, the prototypi-
cal driver more closely resembles multiple NASCAR Cup Series champion Jeff
Gordon and up-and-coming star Jimmie Johnson, who keep their tempers to
themselves and remain composed in virtually any situation.
During a time when many athletes are out of touch with the fans who pay
their bills, NASCAR drivers are seen by many of their supporters as the guy
next door. And they are definitely the most accessible of highly hyped super-
stars. Although some are naturally friendlier and others are more reserved,
many retain an innate humbleness, which comes from remembering the early
days of their careers when they built and worked on their own cars. They
also recognize that without fans, NASCAR wouldn’t exist. Although in this
modern era drivers are pulled in many directions, from testing their vehicles
to making appearances on behalf of their sponsors, they remain fairly acces-
sible. NASCAR drivers still sign autographs and make appearances at malls in
the cities in which they race. (For more information on drivers’ schedules
and their fan clubs, see Chapter 15.)
NASCAR drivers are also known as family men, who bring their wives and
children to many races — thanks to modern, comfortable motor homes
replacing the need to stay in hotels. Many attend church services on the
morning of a race and are very aware they are role models to kids and teens
watching their every move. When people talk about the NASCAR family, they
don’t mean just the competitors. NASCAR fans tend to “adopt” a certain
driver to root for, and he becomes a member of their extended family.
Although NASCAR’s drivers are front and center when it comes to recognition
and attention, they wouldn’t be in the racing business were it not for the hun-
dreds of people who run the sport, create the teams, work on the crews,
sponsor cars and races, and bring the action to the nation via television,
radio, and newspapers. 
14
Part I: NASCAR 101 

At the top of any individual race team is the owner, who pays the bills and calls
the shots. Team owners also spend a vast amount of time searching for and
pleasing sponsors, who spend millions of dollars for the right to put the name
of their company across a car’s hood. The team owner gets a great deal of help
from his general manager and crew chief, who are in charge of everything from
hiring employees to setting the testing schedule to being responsible for a car’s
performance on any given Sunday. Teams employ a large number of special-
ists who work at the race shop doing everything from painting the driver’s
cars to answering the telephone. 
During the last ten years, it has become common practice for an owner to field
more than one team, which is obviously more expensive but gives him or her
more chances to share information between teams and have more opportuni-
ties to visit victory lane. (For more on team ownership, see Chapter 6.)
Winning a Race Takes Strategy
NASCAR racing is about much more than making rules and driving fast. In
fact, becoming successful in NASCAR entails much more than the ability to
wheel a race car at high speeds. By the time a race starts, a driver and his

How I got started
Growing up in Batesville, Arkansas, I thought
racing was the greatest thing in the world. My
dad got me interested in it, and, considering
racing is for people who love taking risks, it was
no wonder he liked it so much. My dad was the
wildest, fastest-running guy around, and he
wanted me to be the same way.
My dad used to prop me up in his lap while he
was in the driver’s seat of the car and, without
taking no for an answer, would make me take
the steering wheel. Then he’d slam his foot on
the accelerator and off we’d go. It scared me to
death, but I was stuck steering that car some-
times at speeds over 80 mph on gravel roads
around our hometown. But the more we drove,
the more I got used to it — and the more I fell in
love with the sensation of going fast and taking
the car to the edge.
I started racing cars when I was 15, even before
I had a driver’s license. That’s when I discov-
ered that everything about the sport of stock-
car racing thrilled me. I became obsessed with
the sounds and the speed — but mostly with the
prospect of becoming a successful driver. For
me, there was nothing better than driving a race
car, especially because I was good at it. I won
my first race in only my second start at a local
track in Arkansas.
S

crew have put in many hours of work building and tweaking the vehicles so
that they handle well for that particular track, whether an oval track, a road
course, or a superspeedway. Once at the track, drivers hit the pavement for
practice laps, trying to coax the most speed they can out of their cars in
order to both qualify and race well. A qualifying lap determines where a
driver will start a race; the one who is fastest over one lap gets to start from
the front pole position and the second-fastest driver starts next to him on the
outside pole.
When the race starts, the objective is to move to the front (if you started in
the back) and hold onto the lead if you started up front. The most successful
drivers are well-schooled in the art of passing the competition, either by
having that day’s fastest car or by hooking up with their rivals in a draft, as
two or three cars end-to-end can push one another past a car stuck out on its
own. (For more information on drafting and race strategy, turn to Chapter 9.)
A good pit crew that can change four tires and fill two cans of gas in less than
14 seconds is also crucial to having a winning car. The first car off pit road,
especially near the end of the race, often is the one that makes the hard left
into victory lane.
Winning has become increasingly difficult as the sport has become more pop-
ular and more drivers enter races. That makes winning more special than it
used to be. Don’t get me wrong, it was special when I won my first NASCAR
Cup race in 1989, but today, there isn’t as much disparity in equipment
between first- and last-place teams. This is fine with me because it makes 
winning more satisfying.
S
16
Part I: NASCAR 101 
Rules keep the fans happy
Like other professional sports, NASCAR has a
rule book. Unlike other professional sports,
however, that rule book changes during the
season — and can even change from week to
week. For example, if a driver’s team gets an
edge over everybody else with the car’s aero-
dynamics or in a particular part of the engine,
NASCAR may change the rule regarding that
area and the team’s advantage disappears.
While some rules changes sometime appear to
help or hinder a certain manufacturer, there are
those that affect drivers equally, such as the
introduction in 2004 of the Chase for the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup, which opened the title race to the
top-10 drivers in the standings (or those within
400 points of the leader) with 10 races remaining.
While some rule changes are difficult to swallow
at times, I appreciate how exciting the changes
make the races for the fans. Without great
racing, there would be no fans. And without fans,
I wouldn’t be living my dream and racing for a
living. It’s a necessary trade-off between the
rules and success. And, unlike the rules changes
before NASCAR was formed, at least we know
our changes in advance. We also know there’s a
reason new rules — to keep the competition as
thrilling and as even as possible.

Heading Out to the Track
Watching a NASCAR race is a total-body experience: the earth-shattering sound
of a 790 horsepower engine roaring when a driver flips the ignition switch, the
sight of 43 colorful cars flying around a track fender-to-fender as the grand-
stands shake, and the gritty smell of burned rubber mixed with gasoline. If
watching races on television from your living room isn’t enough of a rush for
you, it’s time to head out to the track. Here are several great races you may
want to check out yourself (see Chapter 14 for more info on going to races):
 The Daytona 500: NASCAR’s annual Super Bowl, which is held in
February and signals the start of the season. Teams spend several weeks
at Daytona International Speedway getting ready for the year’s most
hotly-contested event. Even past series champions say they don’t con-
sider their resumes complete unless they have won the Daytona 500.
 The Brickyard 400: Long the hallowed ground of the Indy 500 (open-
wheel) race, NASCAR has had no trouble packing the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway stands with more than 300,000 spectators each August. Jeff
Gordon is the event’s master, having won four Brickyard 400s since
NASCAR’s inaugural race there in 1994.

Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around
Mark Martin fans
It’s hard to believe how many NASCAR fans buy
racing paraphernalia to support their favorite
drivers. Then again, as a driver, it’s even harder
to believe how many fans root for me. I drove for
a long time before that sunk in, but I’ll never
forget the moment it did. In 1990, seven long
years after my first NASCAR Cup race, I was dri-
ving at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North
Carolina, battling Dale Earnhardt for the lead. At
that point, Earnhardt had won three of his seven
NASCAR Cup championships, and my goal was
to keep him from winning his fourth title that
year and to beat him in that race. It wasn’t easy
getting by Earnhardt, but when I finally passed
him, the crowd went wild.
Usually a driver doesn’t see the fans because
he’s concentrating so much on the race. On that
day, though, I could see the crowd out of the
corner of my eye as soon as I began the pass.
They were standing up, hooting and hollering as
I pulled next to Earnhardt. They only got louder
as we raced side-by-side down the frontstretch,
which is the straight section of racetrack
between the first and last turns. (See Chapter 8
for more details on the layout of racetracks.) It
created an even bigger stir when I passed
Earnhardt for good and won the race. At that
moment, standing in Victory Lane and seeing all
those fans, I realized that the crowd was rooting
for me and that I had a pretty big following. Even
though Earnhardt won the championship that
year and I was the runner-up, I still felt pretty
good about that moment at North Wilkesboro. It
was unforgettable.
S

 Talladega Superspeedway events: Both races at NASCAR’s longest track
(2.66 miles) are hot tickets. Even with the introduction of carburetor
restrictor plates, which have kept average speeds under 180 mph, fans
can’t get enough of the high-speed action. (For more on restrictor plates,
see Chapter 13.) Many races end with last-lap surprises at this Alabama
track. 
 Bristol Motor Speedway events: This short half-mile track brings out
the beast in every driver, with close-quarters racing sending many dri-
vers to the garage area long before a winner is declared. The bumping
and banging is the bane of many teams, who spend weeks afterwards
smoothing out the dings and dents in the car’s superstructure.
Reaching the Big Time
Millions of fans dedicate a portion of their weekend to attending or watching
NASCAR events, a far cry from the hundred or so who turned up in the sport’s
early days to witness the competition on small dirt or asphalt tracks. In addi-
tion to unparalleled action, NASCAR has grown in leaps and bounds thanks to
two entities: Sponsors and media coverage. Without either, NASCAR most likely
would still be a regional sport with limited opportunities to get a first-hand
look at the action.

Signing up the major sponsors
In 1970, Robert Glenn Johnson, Jr., a legendary
driver and car owner who made his name as a
bootlegger before racing in NASCAR, took a trip
to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and changed
the sport of stock-car racing forever. Johnson,
who goes by Junior instead of his given name,
went to the town to talk to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company (RJR) executives and convince them to
sponsor his race team. The meeting resulted in
much more than anyone imagined. Instead of
sponsoring Johnson’s race team, RJR ended up
sponsoring the entire series.
But things are always changing and in 2003,
NASCAR and Nextel announced a 10-year
series sponsorship beginning in 2004. The wire-
less communications leader wanted to build on
the opportunities associated with the 55-year-
old sanctioning body, as well as the numerous
ways Nextel’s technology enhances the sport
for fans, competitors, officials, media, sponsors,
and tracks. 
Nextel’s investment in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series goes beyond the race track, activating
fan interactive opportunities as well as commu-
nity and charity initiatives. The marketing pact
between NASCAR and Nextel has proved to be
a gold mine of opportunity. A FORTUNE 500
company, Nextel is a leading provider to fully-
integrated wireless communications services
and has built the largest guaranteed all-digital
wireless network in the country.

The sponsors
It costs tens of millions of dollars to operate a NASCAR team, so team owners
must get companies to sponsor their racing organizations to ease most of the
financial burden. These companies use NASCAR as a vehicle (no pun intended)
for their marketing campaigns, with their logos plastered on the cars and the
drivers’ uniforms. But it’s a two-way street because NASCAR and its drivers
also benefit. When NASCAR fans see an advertisement for Budweiser they think
of Dale Earnhardt Jr., who is sponsored by that company. The same holds true
for DuPont, which has reaped immeasurable benefits from its association with
Jeff Gordon. Sponsors are integral in boosting NASCAR’s popularity and in turn
gaining financial rewards. If it weren’t for sponsors, teams wouldn’t have the
financial wherewithal to travel across the country so fans can see them com-
pete in person.
Catching races on the tube
When ESPN began broadcasting in 1979, it needed to fill 24 hours a day with
sports. Broadcasting racing was an ideal way for them to fill hours. It was a
perfect fit — a sports station looking for sports to televise and a sport that

Where are the women?
As you may guess, stock-car racing started out
as a male-dominated sport, but change has
come. Several women drivers and women team
members have made it into NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series, NASCAR Busch Series, and NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series. Janet Guthrie raced in
NASCAR Cup series in the mid-1970s and com-
peted in the 1977 Daytona 500, making her the
only woman to compete in NASCAR’s top series.
She finished 12th. Patty Moise raced several sea-
sons in the NASCAR Busch Series, and Shawna
Robinson became the only woman to win a pole
position for a NASCAR Busch Series race, but
took a hiatus when she had difficulty securing a
sponsor and then decided to have children. More
recently, Tina Gordon has raced regularly in the
NASCAR Busch Series, and Kelly Sutton is a reg-
ular NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series competitor.
Although not many women race, the ones who
do aren’t harassed or berated. Robinson has said
that people treat her just as they do the men dri-
vers — and she prefers it that way because she
would rather distinguish herself as a good driver
than as a good female driver.
Today there are many women in the garage area,
working as journalists and public relations rep-
resentatives. While the number of women work-
ing in the garage grew slowly over the years, the
number of female fans has exploded. Today,
nearly 40 percent of fans who attend races are
women, which is a tremendous gain from 1975
when just 15 percent of attendees were women.
This is all part of the overall growth of NASCAR.
S

was looking to be televised much more extensively than it was. TV rights to
races were less expensive then, costing the networks about $50,000 per
event. After the two came together, some viewers stumbled upon racing,
including NASCAR, because it was on so often. Existing fans couldn’t get
enough to begin with, and the more races that ESPN broadcast, the more
they watched.
The modern era of NASCAR television broadcasting is considered to have
begun in 1979, although it was a coincidence that was the same year as the
birth of ESPN. In 1979, CBS aired its first live, flag-to-flag telecast of the
Daytona 500, catapulting the sport into a new age. In 2004, FOX and cable
partner FX broadcast events during the season’s first half, while NBC and
cable affiliate TNT combined to provide coverage of the second half. Now,
nearly every major network and many cable stations can say they have
broadcast a NASCAR race or have had some NASCAR coverage. That includes
not only the major networks and ESPN but also specialty stations such as
SPEED Channel.

f you think NASCAR is just a bunch of guys driving souped-up race cars,
you’re mistaken. It takes much more than someone working on his grand-
dad’s old Plymouth — no matter how powerful the engine — to race in
NASCAR today. And the money invested and reaped is pretty hefty, too.
You can see NASCAR’s growth everywhere. While you may have expected to
find life-sized cutouts of four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon
greeting you at a General Motors dealership, nowadays you bump into like-
nesses of NASCAR drivers in places you may never expect: on TV, in toy
stores, and even in supermarkets.
While NASCAR started as a primarily Southern-based sport, this is no longer
true. Once the media began paying attention to the fierce competition and
the incredible bonds between drivers and fans, the sport inevitably boomed.
Today, with impressive race tracks opening across the country, as well as
multi-million-dollar sponsorship packages, licensing deals, and television
contracts, NASCAR is everywhere.
Sponsors Pay the Bills
NASCAR racing is more sponsor-oriented than any other sport in the world,
with major companies sponsoring both major races, including the Pepsi 400
and Coca-Cola 600, and individual racing teams — which you’re not likely to
forget. Not only are the cars covered with decals of the companies that spon-
sor race teams and provide race car parts, but the drivers’ and racing team’s
uniforms are plastered with company names — on the chest, on the back,
going down both sleeves and the sides of both legs.

A driver obviously isn’t going to wear a sponsor logo when dressed in a tux,
but when making official appearances at a car dealership or a mall, they wear
hats and shirts with their sponsors’ name on them. Hey, it’s a break for their
clothing budget because sponsors provide all those hundreds of shirts and
hats free of charge.
Different levels of sponsorship exist, primary or associate, based on how much
the company pays to the team. But no matter how much or how little the com-
pany spends, they all do it for the same reason: sponsoring a race team gives
companies a fantastic marketing tool on race day — a rolling billboard. Many
companies, including those in the Fortune 500, take advantage of that.
Companies also become associated with NASCAR through the title sponsor-
ship of races. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Mountain Dew spend big bucks to have
their company name listed as a primary event sponsor. When television
announcers mention a race, they include the sponsoring company’s name in
their reports, such as the Chevy Monte Carlo 400 or the Golden Corral 500.
The primary sponsors are loaded
Primary sponsors are the bigwig companies that pay tens of millions of 
dollars to put their name on the car’s hood, which is the best place to adver-
tise because fans can see it so well. The average price tag for being a primary
sponsor of a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series team is $8 million per season — 
but higher profile and more successful teams get much more, many times in
excess of $10 million. Teams have to secure a good primary sponsor because
the costs of equipment, travel, and personnel are just too expensive for a
team owner to absorb by himself. Without a constant flow of cash, a team
can’t hire the best employees or get the best equipment — and in racing
today, those factors are key to winning.
Viagra is my current sponsor, but I’ve had other primary sponsors in the past,
including Valvoline, Folger’s Coffee, Stroh’s Beer, and Amzoil. You can find all
sorts of companies involved in racing today — companies you’d never expect
to be interested in stock-car racing at all: Kellogg’s, Target, M&Ms, and The
Home Depot. Even Betty Crocker sponsored a car for a while. The diversity
of these sponsors shows how much the sport has moved away from the days
when oil and gasoline companies were the most common types of sponsors.
Primary sponsors also often help determine a car’s paint scheme, or the 
way a car is painted and decorated. The paint scheme usually stays much 
the same throughout a season, but sometimes sponsors change that look for
certain races, perhaps to market a specific brand of their product or unveil
something new. Team owner Joe Gibbs, who recently returned to coach the
S
22
Part I: NASCAR 101 

Washington Redskins, changes NFL team names on his cars throughout the
season, under an agreement with his primary sponsors and the NFL. When
a special paint scheme is unveiled, fans tend to flock to stores to seek out
souvenirs — many of which will become collectors’ items.
Not only do primary sponsors get the most exposure on uniforms and cars,
they also get more of a commitment from the driver in terms of sponsor
appearances. When a driver makes an appearance, he shows up to sign
posters, programs, and trading cards for fans or employees at supermarket
grand openings, auto shows, conventions, car dealerships, fairgrounds, auto
stores, or other venues. Sometimes, sponsors also ask drivers to give a
speech or host a question-and-answer session for fans or employees. With
sponsors’ increasing involvement in the sport, public speaking and public
relations are big parts of a driver’s life. How many appearances a driver is
required to make depends on the contract he or she signs at the beginning of
the season, which lists how many appearances the driver is obliged to pro-
vide. (See Chapter 7 for more information on a driver’s sponsor obligations.)
You’ll have better luck meeting a driver at an appearance than at the race
track. Most of the time when races come to a town, drivers make local
appearances, so keep an eye on the newspaper for those dates and places.
You also can find out where they’ll be during the week by checking with their
race shops (see Chapter 15 for the addresses).
Associate sponsors: The price is right
Companies that can’t afford to spend millions of dollars still get a chance 
to sponsor a race team. Associates pay less money and, in turn, don’t get as
much exposure on the car or the uniform as the primary sponsors do. But
the company’s logo is still plastered on the car, usually on the side — and 
on every diecast collector’s car, in photos, and also on TV when the car is
shown during races. Most teams have dozens of associate sponsors, their
decals creating a colorful mosaic on the side of the car. The associates also
get to use the driver in TV commercials or print ads and get the driver for 
a few appearances each season.
The various levels of associate sponsorships and costs vary depending on the
team and the size of the company’s decal on the car. In the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series, associate sponsorships can cost up to $5 million, with sponsorship
of the higher-profile teams costing more. The highest level of associate spon-
sorship is major associate, which is the level just below a primary sponsor but
above a regular associate. Sometimes, it’s almost like having two primary spon-
sors, but one just happens to pay less and demand less than the other. (See the
color photo near the center of this book for examples of sponsorship logos.)

Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR

Contingency programs: Stick with 
these guys to make some money
Another way for companies to have their names linked with NASCAR is
through the contingency program. Contingency awards are earned through-
out the season by drivers whose cars display a company’s decal. Some of the
best-known contingency programs are the Bud Pole Award, which rewards
a driver with $5,000 for winning the pole position. The Wix Lap Leader pro-
gram rewards the driver who leads the most laps in each race with $5,000.
(For a list of contingency awards, see Chapter 12.) Teams must display con-
tingency program stickers on their cars or uniforms in order to be eligible for
the bonus. Contingency programs are a way for race car parts suppliers and
other companies to advertise with and gain recognition for all the teams they
work with, rather than dishing out money to just one team.
From T-shirts to motor oil: NASCAR 
fans support their drivers
Sponsors know what they’re doing. There’s a reason why races are named
the Sylvania 300 and not “That 300-lap race at New Hampshire International
Speedway.” There’s a reason why Charlotte Motor Speedway was renamed
Lowe’s [Home Improvement Warehouse] Motor Speedway. And there’s a
reason drivers thank their “Ford DeWalt” team when they have a great day 
at the racetrack. It’s because many NASCAR fans live and die by every word
spoken by their favorite driver, every sponsor’s logo shown on their favorite
driver’s car, and every paint scheme or uniform change. NASCAR fans are
loyal — a recent study revealed 76 percent of them use NASCAR sponsors’
products.
You can see evidence of how loyal NASCAR fans are without even going to a
race. Just drive down the highway and look at bumper stickers. Some people
just display the car number of their favorite driver; others show the car
number of their least-favorite driver with a big, thick line through it. The same
loyalty goes for the car manufacturers involved in the sport — some fans don’t
necessarily prefer any one driver, but root exclusively for Ford drivers. Not sur-
prisingly, those fans usually have a bunch of Fords parked in their driveways —
and vow never to own a General Motors car in their lifetime. Car companies
couldn’t be happier about fans like that, particularly because those companies
initially became involved in racing to market and sell more of their vehicles.
NASCAR fans are even more supportive at the races. You can see my fans from
a mile away, wearing Mark Martin T-shirts, Mark Martin hats, Mark Martin
jackets, and even Mark Martin sneakers. It would be a tough task to find a fan
in the grandstands wearing a plain, old shirt with no logos on it — except for
the guys who get sunburned because they don’t wear any shirts at all!
24
Part I: NASCAR 101 

When I was racing on the short tracks of Arkansas, I never thought I’d see
people wearing T-shirts with my face on them or wearing hats with my name
on them. But now it’s really cool because it shows how many people support
me at the racetrack and cheer for me when I drive by. Because I wear an ear
piece while in the car (for the in-car radio), as well as a tight helmet, and
have to contend with the roar of the engine, I can’t hear fans cheering when
I’m driving. But seeing fans wearing my name on their clothes lets me know
that I have people behind me.
NASCAR fan loyalty goes way beyond filling wardrobes with logo-covered 
T-shirts. NASCAR fans are extremely faithful to the companies who sponsor
their favorite driver. That’s where a big chunk of the big business and big
bucks come in. Not only do NASCAR fans support their driver by rooting for
him, they also support him by buying his sponsors’ goods. So, it’s a good
guess that Petty fans still use STP oil treatment, even though it no longer
sponsors Petty Racing, because STP was the team’s primary sponsor for so
many years. And that makes NASCAR appealing to companies who want an
interesting and effective marketing tool.
Licenses Aren’t Just for Driving Anymore
With fans buying up all that NASCAR merchandise, it’s not surprising some
people would do anything to sell stuff to fans and get in on the action. But
making that money isn’t simple. Just like you need a license to drive on the
highway, you need a license to sell merchandise bearing the NASCAR name or
drivers’ names. Otherwise, you can be fined or arrested. Getting licensed is a
serious deal. Unless you want the cops chasing after you, taking all your mer-
chandise, and giving you a big, fat ticket — get licensed if you’re interested in
selling NASCAR paraphernalia.
Licensing gives people the authority to sell particular goods with a particular
name, logo, or likeness on it. Now there’s a good reason why that’s necessary,
at least as far as I see things: It’s embarrassing to have my name or picture

Keeping up appearances
A rookie driver who hasn’t proven himself yet
really doesn’t have much control over which
company will sponsor his team. In most cases,
that driver is so eager for a sponsor that he’ll
take anyone. In my early years as a driver, I was
thrilled to get a call from any company at all.
Now, though, I can be choosy because of my
success in the sport. I’ve been lucky to have
Viagra as a primary sponsor.

on something ridiculously ugly, poorly made, or extremely inappropriate.
Souvenirs are part of the image, so a driver doesn’t want to be part of some-
thing that’s too hokey or that’s a cheap rip-off. Considering all the souvenir
items floating around out there, drivers have lots of opportunities to be part
of cheesy, junky stuff — so somebody had better be watching out for their
interests. There’s also a business aspect to insisting everyone sells licensed
merchandise. Drivers make royalties off the licensed goods vendors sell —
either a percentage of the selling price or just a flat fee.
When buying NASCAR souvenirs, make sure to look for the official NASCAR
hologram sticker. If it has this sticker, along with the official NASCAR logo, 
it’s guaranteed to be quality stuff and not some shoddy souvenir that will 
fall apart the moment you put it on or bring it home. The imitation may be
cheaper than a licensed item, but don’t be fooled — the low price may 
mean low quality. Buying souvenirs from a driver’s souvenir trailer, which 
is located outside the track during races, is a sure way to be safe because 
it sells only licensed merchandise.
You can find nearly every souvenir imaginable relating to NASCAR, including
some everyday items — and some really strange things:
 Clothing: The most obvious souvenirs are T-shirts, jackets, hats, and
button-down shirts. Some less obvious (for NASCAR fans who like a 
complete look) are socks, a water bottle, or a seat cushion with a driver’s
name and car number on them. Fans are proud of the drivers they cheer
for and often show up at events outfitted head-to-toe with merchandise
that identifies them as a driver’s number-one supporter.
 Jewelry: With NASCAR’s growing popularity among women, NASCAR
jewelry has taken off in sales. Souvenir stands and retail outlets stock
almost anything you can imagine, including necklaces, bracelets, rings,
or anklets.
 Home decorating: NASCAR fans don’t have to go far to fix up their
homes with a NASCAR motif. Some licensees sell just about anything 
for the home, and a lot of that stuff has my name on it, too. You can 
find Mark Martin wallpaper, Mark Martin quilts, Mark Martin sheets,
Mark Martin chairs, Mark Martin dishes, and even Mark Martin carpet-
ing. You can even purchase NASCAR crystal platters and silverware 
for entertaining purposes. I’m not saying that buying all this stuff will
make your house stylish, but it will definitely get a point across to your
guests — that you’re a NASCAR fan through and through.
 Office supplies: Looking for NASCAR scissors or a Mark Martin ruler?
Don’t fret, you can find them, along with stationery, pens, pencils, tele-
phones, and nearly everything else you’ll need to get your work done
fast enough to take a couple days off for a NASCAR race.
 Games: The toy business is also involved in stock-car racing. NASCAR
video games are a big deal and a huge seller in stores. You can also find
board and card games relating to the sport — they’re less high-tech but
just as much fun.
26
Part I: NASCAR 101 

 Books: Publishing has become more visible in the NASCAR business in
recent years. The NASCAR Library Collection was introduced in early
2004, helping differentiate authentic NASCAR licensed books, like the
one you’re reading, from others in the marketplace.
 Diecast cars: Perhaps the best-selling NASCAR souvenirs over the years
have been diecast cars, made up with the current year’s paint scheme
on them and a driver’s name above the door, just like on real stock cars.
These babies aren’t just your run-of-the-mill toy cars, though. They have
working hoods, detailed cockpits, tiny engines, and functioning wheels.
Many fans see them as collector’s items — and their price usually reflects
that. They come in several sizes (1:64 scale to 1:24 scale), and sometimes
their price tags are hefty. Some cars, particularly older ones with a hard-
to-find paint scheme, are priced in the hundreds of dollars. For serious
collectors, some are made of 24-karat gold and platinum.
My fans had a perfect chance at buying the quintessential Mark Martin sou-
venir through the Neiman Marcus catalog. The store had one of my race cars
for sale, all painted up with a working race engine under the hood. I guess 
it was for die-hard fans only because it cost $125,000 and wasn’t even legal 
to drive on the street! In fact, the headlights were only decals, as with all
NASCAR cars, so driving it home from the store at night would have been
challenging. But I bet the trip would have been quicker than usual.
Smile, You’re on NASCAR Camera!
There’s one tell-tale sign that NASCAR is popular in the United States: its races
are on TV. Every NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, NASCAR Busch Series, and
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race is broadcast on television. (See Chapter 3
for the lowdown on the differences among the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series,
NASCAR Busch Series, and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.) Qualifying
rounds and even some practices are also televised. That’s amazing, consid-
ering the first NASCAR race broadcast live, flag-to-flag was only 26 years ago.
That race, the 1979 Daytona 500 on CBS, brought racing action into America’s
living rooms for an afternoon. Now racing is more than just a once-in-a-while
show on TV. You can find it virtually every day because the racing season lasts
from February through late November, the longest season of any professional
sport. And one cable network, the Speed Channel, is exclusively devoted to
motor racing, with NASCAR competition making up much of its coverage.
If you’re curious about racing but not ready to devote yourself to it, you 
can catch a peek of the sport before you dive into it as a fan. Turning on your
TV is the first step. It won’t be long until you stumble upon a racing show, in
which races, qualifyings, and practices are dissected, and everyone from the
driver to the car owner to the guy that puts gas in the car is interviewed. You
can find out more about racing than you ever wanted to know if you watch
those shows long enough.

Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR

You can find NASCAR race broadcasts on the major broadcast networks and
cable. The networks are beginning to delve into the sport more and more
because TV ratings have grown each year since NASCAR races began show-
ing up on TV. (For a listing of NASCAR’s television and radio partners, see
Chapter 15.)
TV has become such a big deal in racing these days that broadcasters are quite
innovative in the way they bring the sport to viewers. Developments include
in-car cameras as well as cameras underneath the chassis. From inside the car,
viewers can see the driver turn the wheel and shift. From outside, viewers can
see a car ahead of or behind the driver — and also see whether there is any
contact between the two cars. When a driver crashes, the camera picks up
plenty more action — like a wall coming straight at it or another car smacking
into the rear bumper and then flying off into another car to cause mayhem
on the track. In really hard crashes, the camera can take only so much. Upon
impact, the camera breaks and the transmission goes black. Not all cars have
these cameras for every race, but the shots from those cameras give great
insight into what is going on during a race — a real feel for what’s going on.
28
Part I: NASCAR 101 
Knock-down, drag-out NASCAR coverage
The first NASCAR race broadcast on live TV cer-
tainly made racing seem exciting to non-NASCAR
fans who tuned in. It also made racing seem law-
less. While Richard Petty won that 1979 Daytona
500, the most thrills came from drivers off the
track. Bobby Allison and his brother Donnie
Allison got into a scuffle with Cale Yarborough,
with the TV cameras rolling as America got its
first taste of NASCAR. Although this incident
doesn’t fit with the squeaky-clean image that
many NASCAR drivers have now, it shows how
emotional the sport can get. It also reveals that,
just like any other pro sport, competitors can’t
help but lose their tempers at times.
Shying away from cameras
When I began racing, I didn’t want to talk that
much — much less look into a camera for the
entire world to see. All I wanted to do was drive
race cars and win races, and I was pretty shy
about everything else. I figured that if I wanted
to be famous and on TV, I wouldn’t be much of a
racer.
As my career progressed, however, I figured out
that being on TV was a great way to market
myself, so I forced myself to get used to it. I was
interviewed a lot when I ran on short tracks in
the Midwest, mostly on local radio stations or
on local television stations, so I had a lot of
practice before graduating to NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series racing. Now, I don’t even think about
being nervous because I’m on TV. I just think
about winning races, as all top-level drivers do.
Compared to that, the TV part is easy.

29
Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR
In the spotlight, under pressure
While sponsors drool about how much TV cov-
erage of the sport has grown (more TV means
more footage of cars on the track, all zooming
around with big corporate logos stuck onto
them), for drivers that exposure heightens the
pressure to lead races because the cameras
get plenty of shots of the car out front.
TV coverage also puts a lot of pressure on dri-
vers to speak well and behave in front of the
camera. Every time drivers climb out of cars,
camera lenses are watching, and reporters with
microphones are asking questions. After an on-
track incident, drivers have to explain why and
how it happened. The moment you come out of
the infield care center, which is where you are
taken after every crash even if you’re not hurt
at all, the cameras and microphones are wait-
ing. And at the end of the race, no matter how
frustrated or angry or hot or sweaty or thirsty or
tired you may be, reporters are there waiting for
you to talk to them the instant you crawl out of
your car.
Pro football, baseball, and hockey players at
least get to cool off for a while in the locker room
before the cameras and microphones come run-
ning. But for NASCAR drivers, that immediate
media blitz has become a way of life.

ASCAR racing is more than just one group of drivers traveling all over
the United States to race. NASCAR has many different series, featuring
drivers from different places and with different levels of talent. From its
smaller series to its biggest series, NASCAR racing has a series for every
driver. And for every fan, too.
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series: 
Where the Superstars Are
NASCAR’s highest-profile series is the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, a racing
league akin to the top leagues of other sports. The best hitters play in Major
League Baseball, the best quarterbacks play in the National Football League,
and the best stock-car drivers race in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. It fea-
tures the most recognized drivers in stock-car racing, including ones you’ve
probably seen on TV in some way or another — whether driving in a race,

selling souvenirs on a 24-hour shopping network, or smiling into the camera
during a commercial. Some of the most popular NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
drivers today include the following:
 Jeff Gordon began NASCAR Cup Series racing in 1993 and quickly
earned the nickname “Wonder Boy” because he was only 21. He legit-
imized that nickname when he won his first NASCAR Cup Series title in
1995 at 24, becoming the youngest champion in NASCAR’s modern era,
which dates back to 1972. Gordon followed that title with back-to-back
championships in 1997 and 1998, and a fourth in 2001. En route he broke
records, won races, and frustrated his older and more experienced com-
petitors. Gordon has since grown out of his Wonder Boy nickname and
into a more mature role. He’s NASCAR’s unofficial spokesman, especially
to new fans who may not be familiar with the sport and who may not be
from the southern United States. Gordon’s no good ol’ boy — he grew up
in California before moving to Indiana when he was 13.
 Jimmie Johnson, a California golden boy straight from Hollywood cast-
ing, finished as NASCAR Cup runner-up to champion Matt Kenseth in
2003, and then powered straight back to the top the following season.
Consistency has been a Johnson trademark throughout his NASCAR
career, which began with winning the pole position for his first Daytona
500 in 2002. A teammate of Jeff Gordon in the Rick Hendrick Chevrolet
stable, Johnson is on track to become a champion at the sport’s highest
level.
 Dale Earnhardt Jr., the son of seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion
Dale Earnhardt, came into the sport already a fan favorite, then backed
up his family name by winning NASCAR Busch Series championships
in 1998 and 1999. Jumping up to the NASCAR top series ranks in 2000,
Earnhardt Jr. made steady gains each year, finishing third in the 2003
standings while also being voted the series’ Most Popular Driver.
Junior’s immense popularity is obvious by the sea of red and white
hats and T-shirts in the grandstands on any given weekend.
 Tony Stewart is perhaps the last link between NASCAR’s new breed and
the barnstorming racers of past decades. NASCAR’s Raybestos Rookie of
the Year in 1999, Stewart has finished in the top-10 every year since his
first season, and in 2002 he was crowned NASCAR Cup Series champion.
Prior to jumping to NASCAR competition, Stewart was an outstanding
open-wheel racer, winning the 1997 Indy Racing League title. He contin-
ues to race in the Indianapolis 500 (an open-wheel race — see Chapter 1
for an explanation of the different types of racing) in May before jetting
back to North Carolina the same day for the Coca-Cola 600 during the
evening at Lowe’s Motor Speedway. Stewart is also known for his gen-
erosity; he’s a celebrity who doesn’t forget the “little guy,” such as gate
guards, mechanics, and local short-track racers.
 Dale Jarrett, son of two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett,
grew up watching his dad win races. Following Dale’s first Daytona 500
32
Part I: NASCAR 101 

victory in 1993, Ned said his son had more racing talent than he had
ever possessed. Over the past few years, Jarrett has won more than
30 NASCAR races and has been a consistent contender for the champi-
onship. He won the NASCAR Cup Series championship in 1999, driving
the No. 88 Ford for Robert Yates Racing, to make him and his father only
the second father-son duo to win championships in NASCAR Cup Series
history, joining Lee and Richard Petty.
 Terry Labonte, a two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion from Texas, 
is called “Mr. Consistency” by his peers because he has been so good 
for so long and because his seasons usually aren’t filled with too many
highs and lows. For example, in both years he won the championship
(1984 and 1996), he won only two races, but was always racing near the
front of the pack. People also call him “The Ice Man” because of his even
temper both on and off the track. Labonte’s younger brother, Bobby, was
the 2000 NASCAR Cup Series champion.
 Rusty Wallace, the 1989 NASCAR Cup Series champion, grew up in St.
Louis and learned how to drive on tracks in the Midwest before moving
up to the NASCAR Cup Series. He’s known as one of the most knowledge-
able drivers when preparing a car to race — a reputation he earned by
building and working on his own race cars before coming to NASCAR. He
still works on his cars today, helping his crew get it just right. Wallace
intends to retire from driving following the 2005 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series season.
My goal always was to make it to NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing, which I
believe is the hardest and most recognized racing series in the world. If you
race open-wheel cars (see Chapter 1), you dream about making it to Formula
One someday. But if you race stock cars, you think about the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series day and night: it gets the most live TV coverage, pays the most
money, and earns the most fame for its drivers.

Going overseas
Even though NASCAR racing is based in the
United States, it has held several exhibition races
outside the country. Drivers raced in Japan once
a year from 1996 to 1998 — twice on a road
course in Suzuka and once on a newly built oval
track in Motegi. It was quite a culture shock for
NASCAR drivers and their teams to travel about
8,000 miles from home and arrive in a place
where they didn’t understand the language, cus-
toms, or food and drink. You’ve got to remember:
sushi, which is raw fish, and sake, which is a
beverage made from fermented rice, aren’t
exactly part of the menu when racers travel to
events in Talladega, Alabama, or Darlington,
South Carolina. When I went to Japan in 1997,
however, I didn’t think about the food or sur-
roundings as much as I thought about the race. I
won the pole at the road course in Suzuka and
finished second in the race, right behind Mike
Skinner.

Not only does NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing feature some of the best
and most colorful drivers in motorsports, but it also has some of the closest
finishes. Many times, cars race bumper-to-bumper and side-by-side during an
event — mostly because NASCAR monitors its rules so closely that no car or
car manufacturer has an unfair edge over the competition. Even after a 500-
mile race, it’s not uncommon for drivers to cross the finish line within less
than one second of each other. Even in qualifying, where drivers complete
only one or two laps at full speed in order to earn a spot in the race, the
fastest and the slowest cars are often separated by a fraction of a second.
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series races are held at tracks across the United 
States — from Daytona Beach, Florida, to suburban Los Angeles and Loudon,
New Hampshire. Races are held nearly every weekend of the year, too. The
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series had 36 races in 2004, making its schedule one of
the most — if not the most — grueling in all of professional sports. But don’t
think that drivers work only 36 days out of the year. A race weekend entails 
at least two, and most often three, days of work (qualifying, practice, and the
race), as well as one day of travel. See Chapter 7 for a day-by-day account of 
a driver’s life.
Even so, drivers and crew members don’t mind the rigorous schedule that
much, particularly because they realize how fortunate they are to have made
it to the top level of stock-car racing. While some drivers were able to get a
job in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series early in their racing careers, most dri-
vers spend years trying to get there. Those drivers dedicated their lives to
their goal of making it to NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series competition, spending
a lot of time away from their families while competing in the various series
that travel throughout the country.
NASCAR Busch Series: One Route 
to the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
A lot of drivers, including me, ended up in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series via
the NASCAR Busch Series — a place where drivers can train themselves by
getting experience, making mistakes, and learning from those errors. NASCAR
Busch Series races are usually held on Saturdays, while NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series races are most often on Sundays. But that’s not the only difference.
NASCAR Busch Series racers drive stock cars and follow the same on-track
rules (see Chapter 5) as in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, but the cars have
a couple fundamental differences. Here are some unique aspects of each car:
 Size: Although both NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and NASCAR Busch
Series cars are nearly the same height (51 inches and 50.5 inches,
respectively), the wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear
34
Part I: NASCAR 101 

axles) is slightly different. On a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car, the
wheelbase is 110 inches, while on a NASCAR Busch Series racer, it’s
105 inches. NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars have an advantage here:
their longer wheelbase gives them more stability.
 Horsepower: The biggest difference between the two cars is how power-
ful their engines are. NASCAR NEXTEL Cup cars have significantly more
oomph to them, producing about 790 horsepower. Horsepower is a unit
of measurement representing how much power an engine generates. The
more horsepower, the faster the car. NASCAR Busch Series engines gen-
erate around 660 horsepower. Which means NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
cars should be faster than Busch cars, correct? Yes — and no. One hun-
dred pounds lighter than NASCAR NEXTEL Cup cars, NASCAR Busch
Series racers do reach speeds that are nearly as fast. Though they have
smaller engines, NASCASR Busch Series racers don’t have to lug around
as much weight as a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car.
 Compression ratio: All three major series in NASCAR racing now use 
the same compression ratio (12 to 1), which is the volume inside a cylin-
der compared to the volume it compresses to when the piston is fully
extended. The higher the ratio, the less space the mixture of fuel and air
is shoved into, so the greater the potential for energy. (For more details
on the technical aspects of stock cars, see Chapter 4.)

Chapter 3: Understanding the Different NASCAR Series
The NASCAR Busch Series — not bush league
Even though the NASCAR Busch Series, which
evolved from the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman
Series, is considered a stepping stone for the
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, many drivers bris-
tle at that image. Some, like two-time NASCAR
Busch Series champion Randy LaJoie, love
racing in that series and have made a career out
of it, saying it has the same intense competition
as the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and isn’t 
just a stepping stone. LaJoie especially likes the
fact that, even though he doesn’t get paid as
much as NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series drivers do,
he doesn’t have to deal with nearly as much 
pressure.
The NASCAR Busch Series began in 1982 and
has grown from races at small, unknown tracks
to competitions at large, well-known facilities and
includes nearly as many races as the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series does. Many races are com-
panion events to NASCAR NEXTEL Cup races and
are held on Saturday of a race weekend at a par-
ticular track. That gives NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
drivers a chance to drive, as I do, in both races in
one weekend. And even though NASCAR Busch
Series drivers themselves are quite popular with
fans, having NASCAR NEXTEL Cup drivers in the
race lures even more people to the racetrack. But
even without those well-known drivers compet-
ing, NASCAR Busch Series races have become
popular events in their own right.

The NASCAR Busch Series was a valuable training ground for me, and I haven’t
turned my back on those races now, even though I have been successful in the
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series for more than a decade. I still compete in a limited
number of NASCAR Busch Series races every year, mostly because I love to
race — and win. In fact, I’ve won more NASCAR Busch races than anyone in 
history, 45 times as of 2004. Because the cars are different, some technical
information on how to set them up isn’t the same. But overall, running in a
NASCAR Busch Series race prior to NASCAR NEXTEL Cup competition gives
me hints of how my NEXTEL Cup car will handle on a particular track.
Although winning a NASCAR Busch Series race on Saturday gives me more con-
fidence for Sunday’s NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series events, racing twice in one
weekend is tough. I hardly have any time to stop and take a breath. I get to the
garage early to check out the Saturday car and talk to my Saturday crew chief,
then hop over to my NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car. Then I have to juggle
NASCAR Busch Series practice with NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series practice and
then qualify for both races. Sometimes I’m so busy with that and signing auto-
graphs on my way from one garage to the other that I forget to eat!
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series:
Pickups with Racing Stripes
In 1994, NASCAR decided to branch out and create another major racing
series. But they didn’t opt for just another stock-car series, which may have
been too similar to the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series or the NASCAR Busch
Series. Instead, they chose something completely different. And quite cre-
ative. They started racing pickup trucks.
NASCAR bigwigs sensed the series would catch on because an overwhelming
majority of truck owners are interested in some type of motorsports. The
truck manufacturers were into the idea, and plenty of talented drivers were
looking for jobs, so why not?
In 1995, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series was created with Mike Skinner
taking the first championship. The series has also worked as a breeding
ground — many truck series drivers have advanced to the NASCAR Busch
Series and NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series ranks, although Skinner, after climb-
ing the ladder, returned to the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
Even though NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series vehicles don’t look or feel
much like NASCAR NEXTEL Cup cars, good drivers can handle both vehicles
pretty well. To me, a vehicle is a vehicle and a race is a race. If a driver is
skillful enough to be able to control a vehicle, he can succeed in any series
and in any vehicle.

The following are some differences between passenger trucks (such as a Ford
F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram, and Toyota Tundra) and their NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series counterparts (see Figure 3-1):
 Horsepower: A passenger truck has 160 horsepower. Compare that to
the race truck, which has about 650.
 Length: Passenger trucks are an average 194.5 inches long, while a race
truck is 206 inches long.
 Width: Passenger trucks are an average of 76.8 inches wide. A race truck
is 75 inches.
 Height: Passenger trucks are an average of 70 inches high, race trucks
an average of 59 inches — shorter and much closer to the ground than
their passenger truck counterparts.
 Weight: A passenger truck weighs an average of 3,829 pounds. A race
truck is 3,400 pounds, just like a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup car. Because the
race trucks don’t have to be sturdy to haul things like fill dirt or your
neighbor’s couch, their bodies are much lighter and as streamlined as
possible.

 Wheelbase: A passenger truck’s front and rear wheels are 117.5 inches
apart. On a race truck, that measurement is 112 inches.
 Engine: A passenger truck’s engine is a 4.3 liter, V6 with fuel injection.
A race truck has an 8-cylinder engine with a carburetor.
 Compression ratio: A passenger truck’s compression ratio is 9 to 1. A
race truck’s ratio is 12 to 1. (For more information on compression ratio
in racing vehicles, see explanation earlier in this section.) 
NASCAR Touring Division: Where 
Stars Get Their Start
Most stock-car drivers begin racing at a track near their home, where the
need for traveling money isn’t an issue. Once a driver conquers his home-
track championship, however, he often advances to one of NASCAR’s touring
divisions, which travel to different racetracks within the same region during
their seasons. Touring division competition is where drivers step up on the
financial ladder and start signing up well-heeled sponsors to help finance
their efforts, in hopes of reaching the top NASCAR series. Racing at this level
is much more expensive than running at a home track, where crew members
work for free and often are chosen from among a driver’s friends. It is less
expensive, however, than racing in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, NASCAR
Busch Series, or NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
Home and touring division tracks are generally less than a mile in length,
compared with the much larger speedways in use by the premier series. 
The touring division, for example, doesn’t race at the 2.66-mile Talladega
Superspeedway in Alabama. However, the short-track skills a driver hones
during touring division competition can benefit him greatly when he reaches
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series or NASCAR Busch Series competition and races
at tracks such as the half-mile Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. When a
driver jumps from the touring division to one of NASCAR’s premier divisions,
he is also able to earn a living as a professional racer. The following are brief
descriptions of NASCAR’s different touring series:
 NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series: Running at more than 70 short tracks
across the country on a weekly basis, this series is the foundation of
NASCAR. An early training ground for drivers, crew members, and offi-
cials, the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series also creates hometown heroes
for the fans. A wide variety of race cars are found in this series, includ-
ing Late Model stock cars, Modifieds, Street Stocks, Trucks, Dirt Late
Models, and Sportsman cars. Dodge has sponsored the series since
2002, with drivers competing at their home track for local prizes, as 
well as for a regional and national championship. Participating tracks
are divided into geographic regions, offering teams and drivers at each
S
38
Part I: NASCAR 101 

facility a chance to compete against weekly stars from area tracks with-
out leaving their home track. The NASCAR Dodge Weekly Series has
been the starting point for many of today’s top drivers, including Dale
Earnhardt Jr., Jeff and Ward Burton, Kurt Busch, Kevin Harvick, Bobby
Labonte, Jamie McMurray, Elliott Sadler, and Greg Biffle.
 NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division: Four separate series using identical
cars comprise this division, which is designed to serve as a local driver’s
first step towards NASCAR’s three national series. The Midwest Series,
Northwest Series, Southeast Series, and Southwest Series compete on
short tracks, superspeedways, and road courses, providing opportunities
for teams and drivers to sharpen their skills and work toward their career
goals. AutoZone, the nation’s leading auto parts retailer, joined as the title
sponsor of this division in 2004. The NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division fea-
tures 2,900-pound race cars using metal or fiberglass bodies, powered by
350 to 358 cubic-inch engines. Midwest Series events are held throughout
Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and as far west as Colorado. The Northwest
Series, stretching across Washington, Idaho, and Montana, gave rise to
2002 NASCAR Busch Series champion Greg Biffle. The Southeast Series
covers Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, and Virginia, with
2003 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup champion Matt Kenseth getting his start here.
The Southwest Series covers Arizona and California and ventures into
Colorado for select races. Kurt Busch, Kevin Harvick, and Ron Hornaday,
Jr., are some of this series’ most famous alumni.
 NASCAR Busch North Series and West Series: In 2003, changes to the
weight, engine rules, tires, wheelbase, and other areas were implemented
to bring these two series under one rule book. These cars are powered
by 350 to 358 cubic-inch V-8 engines with a maximum compression ratio
of 12 to 1. The cars have a 105-inch wheelbase, weigh 3,100 pounds, and
run on Goodyear bias-ply tires. The Busch North Series, which entered its
18th season in 2004, runs at tracks in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and
Delaware. The Busch West Series, which entered its 51st season in 2004,
competes in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.
 NASCAR Featherlite Modified Series: When NASCAR began more 
than 50 years ago, teams were permitted to “modify” their stock cars 
for better performance. The 1950s and 1960s-style coupes sprouted
innovative suspension systems and better engines and soon, the cars
looked and drove like nothing else in NASCAR. That tradition of innova-
tion continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in today’s
NASCAR Featherlite Modified Series. As the only open-wheeled division
of NASCAR, the cars in this popular series are unique in many ways.
Featherlite Modified cars weigh 2,610 pounds and have a wheelbase of
107 inches. Hoosier bias-ply tires are used to grip the track under the
power provided by “small block” 350 to 360 cubic-inch engines. The
Featherlite Modified Series competes throughout Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey on
tracks ranging in size from a quarter-mile to the 1.058-mile oval at New
Hampshire International Speedway.

Chapter 3: Understanding the Different NASCAR Series

So, You Want to Drive a Race Car?
Suppose you’re sitting at home one day on the couch watching a NASCAR
race, and you decide that NASCAR racing is for you. You want to be a rich
and famous driver and you want to do it now. What’s the first step?
Although you can buy yourself a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car if you have
enough money and you can find a team willing to sell, that doesn’t mean you
can sign up for the Daytona 500. NASCAR issues its own racing licenses; in
order to qualify, a competitor has to meet a long list of specifications, including
having previous racing experience. You also have to have a lot of cash — or
the ability to get a lot of cash from sponsors, friends, or a rich uncle. Racing
isn’t cheap. Running a good car at a local track can cost $40,000 per season,
and an engine can cost another $20,000. You also need more money to main-
tain the car; buy tires, oil, and gas; and fix the car when you dent it. And
believe me, you will wreck it — because every driver, no matter how talented
he or she may be, runs into obstacles every once in awhile. Some more often
than others.
Pre-stock car (not prehistoric) vehicles
If you don’t have enough money to buy a full-fledged stock car, you can race
more inexpensively with a go-kart. Go-karts are similar to the ones you see 
on tracks adjacent to miniature golf courses. They are tiny vehicles — tiny 
in relation to stock cars, that is — with engines attached to the back. But start-
ing out in go-karts doesn’t mean you’re starting out in racing kindergarten.
Certain go-karts can reach up to 100 mph, and they even race on a course at
Daytona International Speedway, using part of its high-banked track. Also, you
have to sharpen the same driving skills to drive a go-kart that you do for a
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car or a NASCAR Busch Series car. Ricky Rudd
showed the virtues of go-karts when he went straight from them to NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup racing. Go-karts are a viable option — and a great place to get
started — if you’re itching to race.
You can also find all sorts of programs for kids who want to start young.
Midget cars are one of them. Midgets are specialized open-wheel race cars
that are small, fast, lightweight, and have no fenders. They graduate in size,
going from quarter midgets to three-quarter midgets to midgets, the largest
cars in the class. Quarter midgets are the cars kids squeeze into for some fun.
Jeff Gordon started out in midget cars, so you must be able to learn a thing or
two there.
My son, Matt, started racing quarter midgets several years ago, and watching
him race is one of the most exciting things in my life. It’s been fun to teach him
all about the engine, the racing, and the competition — but it’s up to him to
figure out how to win. He’s already done that by winning the championships in
S
40
Part I: NASCAR 101 

his division, showing that he has some racing talent in his genes. Even though
he’s young and is involved in the sport mainly to have fun, he’s developing
valuable skills when driving and controlling a car. Who knows — those skills
may help him win a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series championship someday!
You’ve got a car — now what?
If you’ve scrounged up enough money to buy a stock car and want to begin
your training, what should you do next? Taking a trip to your local short
track is a start. There, you can pick up an application for a NASCAR license.
Your car owner and your pit crew (everyone directly involved in your race
team at the track) need to get a license, too. (See Chapter 6 for the lowdown
on your racing team members.) After you receive your NASCAR license (sent
to you or to the track), you’re ready to race.
Memorize the rules and get a crew
With your NASCAR license, you also receive a rule book for the series in
which you plan to compete. In that book, you can find a rule for every aspect
of racing — especially for all the details and measurements of your car — so
you should plan to tweak your car for at least a week or two before setting a
date for your first race. In the meantime, gather up people for your pit crew
because you’ll need those people — at least two of them — on race day. Your
pit crew will be in charge of your car, tires, and fuel, and will talk to you on
the radio during the race. So when choosing a pit crew, choose carefully. Your
70-pound kid brother may not be the best choice.
Moving up and out
As you become successful on your local short track, you can move up to a
touring series, which travels from track to track — and sometimes all over
the nation. To be eligible for a touring series, you have to first get a license
for that particular series, just as you do when you first start racing at your
local track.
The better the series, the 
harder it is to get there
When you want to try your hand at the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, the
NASCAR Busch Series, or NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing, NASCAR offi-
cials get more involved in the licensing process. They do this mostly because
S
41
Chapter 3: Understanding the Different NASCAR Series

they don’t want some unskilled guy off the street getting in a truck or a car
and taking out the whole field because he doesn’t know how to drive. Before
you get on the track in NASCAR’s top series, you have to fill out a résumé and
an application and then send it to NASCAR for review. Officials license you to
race in those series when they determine that you’re good enough, judging
by your résumé and records in other series. Your car owner, race team, and
everyone who participates on your team also has to obtain a license — the
only difference is that they don’t have to submit a résumé. After you’re
approved, you have to pay an annual fee for your license.
Working on a Crew
It’s much easier to become a member of a race team than it is to become
a driver, mainly because each car has only one driver but dozens of team
members. Some team employees who work at the shop during the week also
travel to an event and serve as race-day crew members, changing tires or
putting in gas. In recent years, however, the majority of race-day crew mem-
bers are specialists who don’t work at the shop, while other team members,
such as engineers, fabricators, and painters, don’t travel on weekends. In this
increasingly specialized field, one way to start working for a team is sweeping
the shop floor — not a very glamorous job but an avenue that can be followed
by someone wishing to eventually expand his duties. 
You can’t really become a NASCAR mechanic if you can’t fix a car. Some
people learn all about cars after getting their initial jobs at race shops.
They show interest and learn from experts, all without getting caught under
people’s feet. I’ve got to warn you, though, that it may take you a long time to
get promoted from sweeper to mechanic or from sweeper to fabricator (the
ones who build the outside, or body, of the car) if you’re learning along the
way. If you already have a working knowledge of cars, you’ll be promoted
much faster.
Another way to sharpen your car skills is to go to a vocational school and
take classes on how to fix engines or work on bodies. Some schools offer a
specific curriculum that focuses on teaching students how to build and repair
NASCAR-type cars. In fact, NASCAR has its own such school, the NASCAR
Technical Institute, which it operates in partnership with Universal Technical
Institute, a vocational school with locations across the country. The NASCAR
Technical Institute opened on July 1, 2002, in Mooresville, North Carolina,
just north of Charlotte, which is known as “Race City U.S.A.” because of the
many NASCAR shops located there. In the future, NASCAR plans to open tech-
nical institutes in other cities.
42
Part I: NASCAR 101 

Going Fast without Going Broke
If setting up a racing operation is out of your budget, there are other ways to
experience the thrill of driving a NASCAR-regulation car at above-average
speeds. Many racing schools teach the fundamentals of on-track maneuver-
ing, such as safely learning to run down straightaways and through corners
as well as how to pass. These include the Richard Petty Driving Experience,
which travels the country and allows you to either ride along with a profes-
sional or get behind the wheel yourself, and the Fast Track Driving School,
which operates out of Lowe’s Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.
Students divide their time between classroom instruction and actually dri-
ving on the speedway.
43
Chapter 3: Understanding the Different NASCAR Series
Pit crews aren’t the pits
If you don’t want to work on the car all week at
the shop but want to help out during pit stops on
race day, there are opportunities for you in
NASCAR racing. (See Chapter 10 for more
details on making pit stops.) You may have a
tough time getting a job on a pit crew if you don’t
know somebody on the team, though, so be pre-
pared to schmooze or make friends fast. Also,
pit stops have become such a big factor in
racing that you have to try out for the pit crew
before you get the job. You’d better lift some
weights and practice changing tires before you
show up at a race team’s door.
The easiest way to get on a crew is to be willing
to do anything, including sweeping floors, to
get your foot in the door. If you’re an efficient,
enthusiastic floor sweeper, people will notice
you and you’ll get promoted before you know it.
It’s true what they say: floor sweeper today,
crew chief tomorrow. Well, maybe it takes
longer than that, but that strategy has definitely
worked in the past. Some people I know, includ-
ing my former crew chiefs Robin Pemberton
and Steve Hmiel, wanted to be on a race team
when they were young and were brave enough
to make a bold move. They just packed up, left
their hometowns, and headed for Charlotte,
North Carolina, where most of the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup race shops are, hoping to get a job
(any job!) with a team. Obviously, it worked out
for Robin and Steve, but others have gone that
route successfully, too.

ASCAR stock cars have no doors, no speedometer,
and no stereo with a sub-woofer. If these facts bewil-
der you, dive into this part. Tucked into nearly every
paragraph, you can find information about NASCAR race
cars and how they differ from passenger cars. In the end,
you realize why it’s impractical and impossible to enter
your four-door Ford Taurus in the Daytona 500, even
though a herd of Ford Tauruses will be racing.
Even if you’re fluent in several languages, understanding
the talk of NASCAR-talk may still be difficult. Sway bar?
Carburetor restrictor plate? Engine dynamometer? These
phrases are commonly used in NASCAR racing, but not at
your bingo parlor or hair salon. You can’t even find most
of them in your dictionary. But never fear, I define those
words and plenty more in this part.
In addition to helping you understand the basic compo-
nents of a stock car, this part fills you in on the rules and
inspections of NASCAR racing. You meet all the people
who have to follow those rules, including the important
members of race teams. You also find out that I do other
things besides drive a race car on Sundays!

ASCAR racing has changed since its early days of passenger cars with
numbers painted or taped on the sides — the cars raced were often the
family car you drove to the track. Races featured cars that fans could go out
and buy off the showroom floor of the local dealership the same day they saw
them race. Manufacturers wanted their cars to win so they could benefit from
a unique type of advertising — as the saying went, “Win on Sunday, sell on
Monday.”
Today, however, the cars are anything but “stock.” They are custom built from
the ground up. The only thing vaguely stock about them is the general shape
of the body. Teams have engineered ways to make the cars’ bodies more aero-
dynamic, devised methods of producing more horsepower while keeping the
engine sturdy, and, with much help and guidance from NASCAR, have devised
new safety features to further protect the drivers. After all these innovations,
describing the differences between a passenger car and a stock-car racer is
like describing the differences between miniature golf and the PGA tour.

In this chapter, I discuss the major differences between passenger cars and
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars, giving you an overview of what you see on
the track every weekend.
What Cars Will I See Racing?
Three car models now make up the entries in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series:
 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
 Ford Taurus
 Dodge Intrepid
The manufacturers all have a staff of engineers working in their racing 
divisions — located in or near Detroit — in order to make their brand more
competitive on the track. They work on developing better aerodynamics,
engines, and engine parts, and also work with their respective race teams
to try to get an advantage over the other car makes. But, as I talk about in
Chapter 5, NASCAR officials try to keep that from happening because their goal
is for every car to have an equal chance of winning so that fans aren’t bored by
the same car and the same driver winning each race.
The race car versions of the Dodge Intrepid, Ford Taurus, and Chevrolet
Monte Carlo look quite similar to each other, so it’s not easy to tell one car
from another if you’re not familiar with racing. So manufacturers slap the
name of the car on every vehicle. For example, the Chevrolets have a big
decal with the words “Monte Carlo” on the nose of the car, Fords splash a 
big “Taurus” in the same spot, and the Dodges have an “Intrepid” decal 
where everybody can see it. When in doubt, check the front of the car to
know which model is which.

Manufacturer loyalty
While some fans cheer for a particular driver or
team, others have an allegiance to a specific car
manufacturer. For example, if your grandfather
drove a Chevy his whole life and your dad drove
a Chevy his entire life, you may be persuaded to
root for Chevys on race day. It’s that kind of loy-
alty that car manufacturers love — and it’s that
kind of loyalty that keeps them in racing.

What Is “Stock” about a Stock Car?
Not much of a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car is similar to a passenger car.
Stock cars are built for speed and safety, not to take the kids to soccer prac-
tice, so they don’t have cup holders or vanity mirrors, and none have an
automatic transmission. Performance, not comfort or convenience, is what
counts — which explains why stock cars last an average of three years,
unlike passenger cars, which are manufactured for longevity.
The following are some things that you may be used to seeing on a passenger
car but won’t find on a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car:
 Doors: That’s why drivers climb through the window opening to get in.
 Windows: There’s just a window-shaped opening covered with safety
netting to prevent the driver’s head and arms from going outside the car
during a crash. On the passenger’s side, teams install a plastic window
that doesn’t roll down, but only for tracks 11⁄2 miles or longer. On tracks
shorter than that, there’s nothing covering the window opening.
 A glass windshield: In race cars, the windshield is in three sections instead
of just one and it’s made of Lexan, which is hard, shatterproof plastic.
 Back seats or passenger seats: There’s just one seat — the driver’s seat.
 Brake lights or headlights: The lights you see on the race car aren’t 
real — they’re just decals.
 Speedometer
 Gas gauge
 Storage space in the trunk
 Stereo system or speakers
 An air conditioning or heating system
 Automatic transmission
 Anti-lock brakes
 Cruise control
 A key ignition: Drivers just flip a switch to get the car going.
 Air bags
 Locks
 Glove compartment
 A horn

Chapter 4: What Makes Them Stock Cars? 

The body
The body of a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car is only partly stock. The hood,
the rear deck lid (or trunk lid, as it’s normally called), the roof, the front grille,
and the bumper panels are similar to the ones on passenger cars because
they’re obtained from the manufacturer, although they’re modified a bit per
NASCAR’s specifications (see Figure 4-1). Car builders make the rest of stock-
car bodies from scratch. The few factory-made parts on NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series cars, however, make them recognizable as cousins of the Intrepids,
Tauruses, and Monte Carlos that you see driving down the highway. It also
helps that teams place decals of headlights on the cars to make them look 
similar to passenger cars.
Aerodynamic features
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars each have a rear spoiler, which is a metal
blade that runs the width of the car atop the back of its trunk (see Figure 4-2).
The spoiler makes the car more aerodynamic by regulating the air as it flows
over the car. It also provides stability to the back end of the vehicle. (Flip to
Chapter 13 to read more on aerodynamics.) The spoiler collects air as it flows

over the vehicle, and the air forces the back end into the ground, making it
more stable. You may see passenger cars with spoilers on them, but most
of the time they’re for looks, not for aerodynamics. Spoilers need to be big
enough and mounted at the right angle to help control airflow, and passenger
cars generally never go fast enough for aerodynamics, or a spoiler, to make a
significant difference.
Some fancier sports cars or snazzier passenger cars may have an air dam
that’s attached to the front bumper and goes nearly to the ground. Every
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car has one, though, because it plays an impor-
tant role in aerodynamics (refer to Figure 4-2). An air dam blocks air as it hits
the front of a car, keeping most of it from flowing under the vehicle, which
would reduce speed. The closer an air dam is to the ground, the easier a car
can cut through the air. The air dam also helps keep the front stable.
The engine
A NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car uses an 8-cylinder engine (see Figure 4-3),
just as the most powerful, sportiest passenger cars do. Here are similarities
between a NASCAR V8 race engine and a typical V8 passenger car engine:
 The number of cylinders
 The location of the spark plugs
 The number of intake ports
 The number of exhaust ports

The manufacturers provide teams with engine blocks that have an engine dis-
placement between 350 and 358 cubic inches — cubic inches are one way to
measure the size of the engine. A run-of-the-mill passenger car engine has an
average of 150 to 200 cubic inches. In racing, the bigger the engine, the more
horsepower it will produce.
The manufacturers also outfit the teams with certain performance parts 
built to withstand 500-mile races, high speeds, and other stresses. After
teams get these parts, they start tweaking them to their liking — and that’s

Show cars
If you want to see a race car up close, you don’t
necessarily have to go to the racetrack. From
time to time, you can see one at your local mall
or grocery store. Teams have show cars that
travel around the country so fans can get a
taste of NASCAR without having to pay for race
tickets. While the cars are just for show, they
are real race cars that were taken out of com-
mission for being too old, suffering irreparable
damage, or because they just weren’t suited to
the driver.
The car has everything that a real race car 
has, including a working engine so the show-
car driver can demonstrate to fans how loud a
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup car gets. The show-car
driver, whose job is to drive the show car all
over the country, brings the car to stores, fairs,
and driver appearances. It doesn’t cost any-
thing to check it out, so if you’re curious about
race cars, these appearances are perfect
opportunities to see one in person and get a
good look at it.

why not every engine produces the same amount of horsepower. Most pro-
duce about 750 horsepower, much more than a passenger car, which averages
about 200. The rpm, or revolutions per minute, can approach 8,900 in a race
engine, which would blow your passenger car’s engine to smithereens because
its engine can’t rev over 5,000 rpm for long. (RPM describes how many times
the crankshaft turns. The crankshaft, which rotates the drive shaft that pro-
vides power to the wheels, is itself rotated by the up and down action of the
eight pistons.) With all that wear on a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup engine, teams
have to replace many of its parts after every race, including the pistons,
valves, and springs — basically anything that may have been worn even
slightly. That way, the team helps prevent the engine from breaking during
the following event. It takes about two days of work to freshen up a used
engine, even if nothing needs to be repaired, because team members must
replace many parts and meticulously comb over the engine for potential
wear or defects.
Carburetors
Unlike passenger cars that were switched to fuel-injected engines that get
better fuel mileage and have fewer emissions that harm the environment,
NASCAR stock cars still use carburetors. A carburetor mixes air and fuel 
that pass into the engine’s cylinders for combustion, while in a fuel-injected
engine, an electric pulse triggers the release of a specific amount of fuel,
which is then sprayed into each cylinder for combustion. To put it simply,
NASCAR teams can get more horsepower from an engine with a carburetor
(shown in Figure 4-4) than with fuel injection.
While teams can fiddle with the engines to enhance their performance, 
they can’t do just anything that pops into their heads. NASCAR sets certain

Chapter 4: What Makes Them Stock Cars? 

parameters for the equipment and makes sure teams follow the rules by
policing engines during inspections (see Chapter 5 for more on rules).
NASCAR officials have to approve all parts before teams use them to ensure
that no one has an unfair advantage. NASCAR’s goal is to make races as close
and exciting as possible, so no one with an engine made of spaceship parts
gets to use it.
Built for strength and speed
In racing, people make their living building high-performance engines that
produce a lot of horsepower but can also withstand the grueling conditions
of a long race. If that engine builder is a good one, he’s bound to make a nice
salary because good engines are vital to winning races.
An engine builder in NASCAR racing reinforces parts of the engine, such as
the sections around the crankshaft (refer to Figure 4-4) by adding material 
to the bearing, which is a metal part that protects the crankshaft and the 
connecting rods from overheating and friction — to help prevent the engine
from breaking down during a race. Only steel crankshafts are allowed,
although most have been lightened and balanced for increased horsepower.
Teams use other reinforced parts in a race engine — in fact, most parts are
reinforced — including extra-strength valves, camshafts, connecting rods,
and valve springs.
It takes an engine builder about seven working days to obtain parts, tweak
those parts, and put together an entire engine. The cost of that completed
engine is about $80,000. Some teams build their own engines, while others
buy them from outside companies. Sometimes, teams even lease engines if
they’re trying to qualify for an important race or racing in a marquee event,
such as the Daytona 500. The price of a leased engine isn’t pocket change,
though. It can range anywhere from $10,000 to $40,000 or even more — and
you have to give the engine back when you’re done.
Engine builders and engine tuners, who work on the engine after it’s built 
to make it produce more horsepower, have turned high-tech along with
everything else in NASCAR racing. They use special machines called engine
dynamometers, commonly known as “dynos,” which test an engine’s perfor-
mance and measure its horsepower. During these tests, team members may
run an engine for several hours, mimicking a 500-mile race, just to see how
the engine will hold up or wear under race conditions and how much horse-
power it will produce over the course of a race. The information from the
dynos is collected and relayed by computers for team members to analyze
the data. If the team finds problems, the engine builder or tuner can make
repairs before the car hits the track.
54
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

Teams also use machines called chassis dynamometers to measure the amount
of power translated from the wheels to the ground (see Figure 4-5). It’s different
from an engine dynamometer, which only tests the engine when it’s not in the
race car. The entire race car gets hooked up and anchored down to this large
gizmo that in many cases looks like a regular old, open car trailer. But two
rotating drums spaced the same width apart as the rear wheels of the race car
are built into the floor of the trailer, and the car’s rear tires are positioned on
top of these drums. When the engine is fired up and power is applied to the
rear wheels, they begin turning, and the drums begin turning as well. Of course,
because the rear wheels are turning the drums, the car stays in place. The 
measurements from the rotation of the drums allow teams and NASCAR offi-
cials to analyze the performance of the cars.
Teams don’t build just one engine for a race and then hope it holds out for
the duration of race weekend. Well-funded teams can have three engines just
for qualifying — a primary, a backup, and a backup to the backup. If a race
engine goes bad between qualifying and the start of a race, teams can make
a substitution but must start from the rear of the field, regardless of their
qualifying effort. Once the race starts, teams can fix individual parts but
can’t re-install entire engines.
Suspension
Perfecting the suspension — or the parts that affect the handling of a race 
car — is one of the most complex aspects of racing. The gist of making the
suspension just right is figuring out how much force to put on each corner 
of the car. That determines how the car rides, how easily the driver is able to
control the car, and how fast he can go through the turns. A car that has good

balance among all four wheels handles better, allowing the driver to hit the
brakes later going into the turns and mash the gas that much sooner coming
out of the turns, which of course means he will go faster.
The suspension in passenger cars has springs and shocks that provide a
smooth and comfortable ride at low speeds over a period of years, with few
or no adjustments necessary. In race cars, however, a team makes constant
changes to the suspension to improve the car’s performance. The key is getting
the right combination. NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars have independent
suspension on the front only, meaning the front wheels act and react sepa-
rately from one another, while the back ones react the same to every bump,
turn, or dip — see Figure 4-6 for a complete look. The adjustable parts of the
suspension, as well as other elements that can affect the performance of the
suspension, are some of the most important parts of a car’s setup, which is
how the car is prepared to drive on the track with optimum handling and
speed. Here’s a suspension primer:
 Air pressure: Changing the air pressure in the tires is the change most
teams use as their first option to try to improve the setup of a car during
a race. That’s because they can change the air pressure in the new tires
before the pit stop, so they don’t lose any time making adjustments on
pit road, which can add seconds to a pit stop, often causing a driver to
lose positions. If the car needs more drastic changes because it still isn’t
riding to a driver’s liking, teams can put different amounts of air pres-
sure in each of the tires, change the pressure of only one tire, or change
a combination of tires. The amount of air pressure put in or taken out
depends on where the driver has problems in the turn (at the entrance,
in the center, or exiting the turn).
 Camber: Before the race, teams monitor tire wear and tire temperatures
to see how the tire is performing on the track. If the tires are wearing out
too much on one side, or are too hot on one side, teams will change the
camber of the tires — changing the angle of the tire so it touches less or
more of the racing surface. Camber is measured in degrees from vertical.
In addition, camber is adjusted on the front tires to assure they have a
uniform temperature.
 Shock absorbers: Shock absorbers are cylinders attached to the car’s
wheel that make the car ride more smoothly over bumps. They take care
of the tire and control how fast the wheel moves up and down. The key
is to figure out the optimum combination of a smooth ride and fast wheel
speed. To do that, most teams hire specialized “shock engineers” whose
sole job is to build and test shocks and devise ways to make them work
better so their car goes faster.
Teams even hook up the shock to a shock dynamometer (see Figure 4-6),
which pumps the shock up and down as if it were in a real car. The 
computer prints out results of the test, which show how much force is
used when the shock compresses and extends. That’s how a team figures
out the right shocks and how to adjust them for optimum performance
during qualifying or a race.

Chapter 4: What Makes Them Stock Cars? 

At superspeedways, shock technology went a bit far in recent years.
Teams began to adjust the shocks so that they would depress once the
car got on the track but would never rebound. This made the car lower
to the ground and improved the aerodynamics, allowing the lower-slung
car to cut through the air easier and faster. The problem is that the ride
was too bumpy and nearly uncontrollable for drivers — a particular
danger at superspeedways. Drivers said the ride was so jarring, it felt
like the fillings were going to come out of their teeth. But they were, 
and are, willing to endure just about any discomfort if it means another
couple of horsepower or a couple of hundredths of a second off the 
stop watch. However, NASCAR decided to use a uniform shock for those
racetracks. Teams pick up four shocks with equal specifications on qual-
ifying day and race day at the superspeedways — Daytona International
Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
 Springs: Teams have a closetful of springs. The tension on each spring,
which is the spring rate, determines how smooth the ride will be and
how much weight is put on each tire. Some springs compress more
easily than others. The key is to get the right spring with the optimum
spring rate in the proper corner of the car. What makes it even more dif-
ficult is that you can put different springs in all four wheels. Teams can’t
change springs during a race, but they can insert a rubber block (clev-
erly called a “rubber”) between two coils of the spring to increase the
tension or take it out to decrease tension. That makes the handling of
the car looser or tighter, depending on which spring (and which wheel)
the rubber goes into.
If a car’s suspension is loose, the rear tires don’t provide enough trac-
tion, making the rear of the car fishtail when a driver goes through a
turn. The driver feels as if he’s losing control of the car and about to
spin out. This is also called oversteer. A tight suspension is the opposite:
when a driver goes through the corners, the front of the car doesn’t turn
well because the front tires are losing traction before the rear tires are.
When a car is tight, it also means it’s pushing — and if a driver isn’t care-
ful, he’ll end up zooming right into the wall.
 Track bar: The track bar is a part of the rear suspension that’s attached
to the frame on one side and to the rear axle on the other. It keeps the
tires centered within the car. Without the track bar, the frame of the car
would sway from side to side, making the car unstable and difficult to
drive. Teams can raise or lower the track bar by inserting a wrench
into a hole located above the right rear tire, and this adjustment makes
the car easier to control at high speeds. The track bar is also called a
Panhard bar.
 Sway bar: Most race cars have two sway bars — one in the front and
one in the rear — which alter the amount a car rolls to one side or the
other through the turns. The front sway bar, which is always used —
although the rear sway bar isn’t used at some tracks — is attached to
the frame and the lower control arms of the suspension. During practice,
teams change sway bars to change how much weight is transferring to
58
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

the springs on each corner of the car. Teams can’t make adjustments
to the sway bar during a race, so they’re stuck with what they put in
before the event. At times, though, teams will disconnect the rear sway
bar — which is connected to the frame and the rear-end housing — and
remove it all together.
 Wedge: Putting wedge in means putting more weight onto a wheel by
compressing the spring. Teams can put wedge into the rear wheels
during a race by inserting a long socket wrench into a hole above the
tires. Putting a half round of wedge in means they are turning the wrench
in a half circle — and placing that much more pressure on the spring.
Taking two rounds of wedge out means turning the wrench twice counter-
clockwise and loosening the spring. A round of wedge is also called a
round of bite.
Other differences
Here are some other features that make a NASCAR stock car different from a
passenger car:
 The steering wheel is detachable, making it easier for the driver to enter
and exit the car (see Figure 4-7).
 The car has roof flaps (rectangular pieces of metal) that pop up when
the car travels backwards. When a car spins at a superspeedway, the
aerodynamics change in a potentially dangerous way. The air is not being
displaced by the front air dam, but is now rushing under the sides of the
car and over the top in a way that causes a car to fly up into the air for
a second or two. The roof flap, when it pops open, disrupts the airflow
pattern over the roof so all four wheels of the car stay on the ground.
See Chapter 11 for more on roof flaps. The roof also has an escape hatch,
Releasing

and exit.
59
Chapter 4: What Makes Them Stock Cars? 

which allows the driver to pop through the roof of the car if the driver’s
side window doesn’t allow an exit. The roof hatch, introduced in 2003, is
not a mandatory installation.
 The gas tank — called a fuel cell — is located below the trunk and is far-
ther to the rear than in passenger cars (see Figure 4-8). It’s made of steel
with an internal rubber bladder that’s much stronger and more durable
than a passenger car’s gas tank.
 The trunk and the hood are fastened down with several steel pins, which
allows for quick and easy access but secure attachment as well. Also,
steel safety cables are attached between the frame and both the hood
and trunk lid to keep them from flying off in an accident.
 An internal roll cage, made of tubular steel (see Figure 4-9), is a basic and
primary safety feature that protects drivers during crashes.

 The exhaust doesn’t exit from pipes at the rear of the car. It exits on 
the right side of the car, opposite the driver, near the rear tires (see
Figure 4-9). The exhaust used to exit on the left side of the car, under-
neath the driver’s seat, but this made the car unbearably hot.
What’s Inside?
If you peer inside a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car, you won’t find luxurious,
finely upholstered leather seats, a radio, or a clock. It’s as austere as possi-
ble, made for utility and function, not style or convenience. Figure 4-10 gives
you a peek inside.
The gauges on the dashboard are a perfect example. You won’t find a
speedometer to see how fast you’re going or an odometer to see how far
you’ve traveled. All cars, however, have a tachometer that measures the
number of revolutions per minute — or rpm — of the engine. It indicates 
how hard the engine is working.
The gauges in a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car vary from car to car, depend-
ing on what the driver is used to, but some of the gauges — in addition to the
tachometer — include the following:
 Oil temperature
 Water temperature
 Oil pressure
 Volt gauge to monitor the battery and electrical system
 Fuel pressure gauge
Next to those gauges you find a few switches, which always include an igni-
tion switch. That’s why drivers don’t need a key to start their cars. They just
flip the switch and the engine roars. There also is a second ignition switch
that controls a second ignition box. Sometimes in a race, you see a car drop
way back for no apparent reason and just as suddenly recover and start
moving toward the front again. That’s an indication that the car may have
stalled because of ignition failure and that the driver has switched to the
back-up ignition to remedy the problem.
Next to the ignition switches are switches that turn on the driver’s cooling
system, which sends air into the driver’s helmet and suit. Also, you may find
a brake fan that blows air on the front brakes to keep them cool and working
properly. (Cars used at short tracks have rear brakes only, so the extra fans
are in the rear in those cars.) A car may also have a rear end fan which to
keep the grease cool so the rear-end gear doesn’t burn up.
61
Chapter 4: What Makes Them Stock Cars? 

If you look at the pedals on the floor of the driver’s seat, you notice a brake
pedal, a gas pedal, and a clutch pedal. In a passenger car, everyday drivers
use their right foot to control the gas and brake pedals and their left foot to
control the clutch. In racing, it doesn’t necessarily work that way. Most dri-
vers use their right to hit the gas and their left to hit the brake and the clutch.
Those who use this two-foot method, including me, believe it is a faster and
more efficient way to get on and off the gas and brake.
Take a Seat
A stock car has only one seat, and that’s for the driver. And it certainly isn’t
very comfortable to sit in — see Figure 4-11. The seats are made of aluminum
or titanium, covered with padding, and custom-fitted to a driver’s body. Even
through a driver may spend four hours in that seat during a race, it can’t be
too comfortable because that would mean it isn’t safe enough. The seats
must be snug so there’s no room to move around, which keeps a driver safer
in case of an accident. To protect a driver’s ribs, two extensions jut from each
side, so that drivers have to wiggle into their seats instead of just sliding in.

The seat also has extensions to protect a driver’s legs, head, and neck. Head
and neck restraints also are mandatory. And no, the seat doesn’t recline so
the driver can relax when a caution flag slows traffic.
Treadless Tires
NASCAR uses high-performance Goodyear tires that don’t look much like 
the ones you use on your family car. And they certainly cost much more 
than what you’d pay for the ones on your family car. (What do teams pay 
for these upscale beauties? Roughly $350 to $400 per tire.) NASCAR tires are
wider than passenger-car tires — the part that actually touches the ground is
about 11 inches wide (see Figure 4-12). They are treadless so that the cars get
as much traction as possible — the more rubber that touches the racing sur-
face, the better.
Goodyear employees come to every race and prepare the tires for the teams,
including balancing and mounting each tire onto its wheel. Each team has its
own set of wheels at each race, sometimes color-coordinated with the car’s
paint scheme, which a separate company transports to and from each race-
track. Having a separate company deal with the wheels makes it easier for
teams because it frees up room on their haulers (see Chapter 6 for more on 
the race team members) for other equipment. It also allows the Goodyear tire-
busters, who mount and balance the tires, to start mounting tires even before
the teams unload their equipment. On a typical race weekend, NASCAR teams
use between 9 and 14 sets of tires, depending on the length of the track. At four
tires per set, with 43 cars on the track, that means the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup

Series use up more than 1,000 tires in a single race, and sometimes more than
2,000. By comparison, an average set of street car tires is replaced approxi-
mately every three years. Goodyear uses 18 different tire codes to cover the
needs of NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series teams, providing tires with softer or
harder compounds to match the tire-wear tendencies of each speedway.
Time Out for Technology
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars are supposed to be simple, not high-tech.
They aren’t outfitted with on-board sensors the way Formula One cars are
(see Chapter 1 for more on other types of race cars). NASCAR officials make
sure cars stay that way by checking the car before every race for computer-
ized items, including the following outlawed instruments:
 On-board computers
 Recording devices
 Electronic memory chips
 Traction control devices
 Digital gauges

In certain cases, though, cars are outfitted with sensors — called telemetry —
at the request of the network broadcasting the race. The sensors are placed
throughout the car to monitor the rpm (revolutions per minute), mph (miles
per hour), when and how often the brake and gas pedals are pressed, and
which gear the driver selected (with the stick shift). Some networks broadcast
that information during the race to show in graphic detail the performance
characteristics of a certain car. This telemetry is usually used in conjunction
with in-car camera shots broadcast from that car.
Every team has an electronic transmitter called a transponder on its car during
a race. The transponder, shown in Figure 4-13, is a transmitter that teams affix
to the bottom of their car — on the right side of the box that protects the fuel
cell — to monitor lap times around a track. Every time the transponder hits
a certain point on the track, it records the lap time on a remote computer.
Teams huddle around a computer during qualifying to see lap times pop up
and who is qualifying where. Also, during a race, those times register on a
computer in the pits, so that teams can figure out how fast their car is going
relative to the other cars on the track.

W
hen sitting in the grandstands at a NASCAR race for the first time, 
you may have trouble making sense of what the heck is going on. 
With your binoculars, you can probably see a lot of activity in the garage
area, and with your own eyes, you can see what’s happening out on the 
track — but you may not have any idea what to make of it. Don’t fret. This
chapter gives you the lowdown so you don’t feel so lost.
Living by the Rule Book
At the beginning of each year, NASCAR officials hand out rule books to every
driver, crew member, car owner, and anyone else with a NASCAR license.
They don’t give tests on the material, but they do have a clever, effective way
to find out whether the racing teams know and follow the rules: NASCAR offi-
cials inspect each car several times during a race weekend, checking to see
that teams follow the regulations. Inspecting the cars isn’t an easy task, con-
sidering there are so many regulations to abide by — and so many that teams
try to get around them.
A rule for everything
The rule book is crammed with pages of specifications, mandates, and “sug-
gestions.” These rules give teams details of how to do almost everything they
need to compete, including how to build a car to NASCAR specifications, what
safety measures to implement, and how to fill out paperwork such as entry
blanks for races.

Some of the other rules deal with the following issues:
 Engine: A team can’t have just any engine in their car. It has to be a cer-
tain size and must be set up in a certain way, so cancel your call to those
NASA engineers for their rocket science advice.
 Body: Even though NASCAR car bodies are hand-crafted in a race shop,
NASCAR still enforces rules on the basic shape of each vehicle. That
means a team can’t have a Ford Taurus body that looks like one of those
rocket-type cars on The Jetsons.
 Tires: NASCAR tries to contain costs for car owners, so it has specific
rules about how many sets of tires a team can use for qualifying and
practice.
 Gas tank: Many times, races may come down to which team gets better
fuel mileage (meaning which team can make it farther on a single tank of
gas), so NASCAR makes sure to check that the fuel cell — the fancy word
for gas tank — isn’t bigger than it’s supposed to be.
 Testing policies: Teams are permitted five two-day private car tests and
four single-day tests each season at tracks that run NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series events. Rookies are permitted seven two-day tests and five
single-day tests. New teams or those not among the top-45 in the previ-
ous season’s owner points receive one two-day test and one single-day
test until they attempt to qualify for an event. Each time they attempt to
qualify, these teams receive another two-day test package. Teams are
free to test at tracks that do not run NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series events,
and those tests do not count against their allotment.
 Pit stops: When a car comes in for tires or fuel during the race, the team’s
pit crew jumps over the pit wall to service the vehicle. But that group
can’t just do whatever it wants. NASCAR specifies how many people can
go “over the wall” to work on a car during a race and has certain rules for
how the team should conduct the stop. For more on pit stops and the
rules that govern them, see Chapter 10.
While NASCAR has many guidelines for building and preparing a race car for
competition, it doesn’t have specific rules that govern how drivers race
against each other. However, NASCAR does reserve the right to penalize dri-
vers for rough driving, such as bumping into the back of another car to pass it
or causing another car to crash when an accident could have been avoided.
Drivers have unspoken rules among themselves called gentlemen’s agreements
about how aggressive you should be on the track. Not everybody follows those
rules; it depends on the driver. Some are known to race like bullies, knocking
cars out of the way to pass them.
NASCAR’s rule book is packed with so many regulations regarding the race
car that you’d be hard pressed to come up with something that it doesn’t
have a regulation for. Every crew member has a NASCAR rule book for the
series they’re involved in, and many of them spend a lot of time figuring ways
68
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

to get around the rules. I get into that more in the “Being Creative with the
Rules” section later in this chapter.
Covering the rules at the drivers’ meeting
NASCAR teams and drivers really don’t have to sit down with the rule book
and study it from cover to cover. They have a pretty good idea of what’s
inside from starting out on local tracks and making their way through the
ranks. If any specific rule changes are made for on-track activity — such as
making a pit stop in a very small pit stall (the area a driver must pull into so
that the crew can service the car) or starting the race on a restart at a partic-
ular point on the track — NASCAR officials review those changes during the
drivers’ meeting. That meeting is normally held two hours before the event,
and it’s the one time during a race weekend when all the drivers and crew
chiefs are in the same place at the same time.
Even the drivers’ meetings have rules. Drivers and their crew chiefs must
attend the meeting — and be on time — or they’re penalized. If a driver or his
crew chief misses the meeting, the driver automatically starts the race from
the last-place spot, no matter where he qualified. This can be embarrassing
for a driver who qualified third but overslept, missed the meeting, and had
to start the race in last place. His team gets upset because all the work it
put in to qualify up front goes to waste. The sponsors aren’t too happy about
the driver falling back to last place in the field either. Companies don’t pay
hundreds of thousands — sometimes millions — of dollars to see their cars
start last.
Even though drivers know the rules, they occasionally may ask questions at
the drivers’ meeting in order to clarify an issue. For example, if a driver isn’t
sure where to start accelerating when the green flag falls (signaling the start
or restart of the race), he asks a NASCAR official to go over that point. Or
sometimes a driver uses the drivers’ meeting as a chance to speak up about
something that has been bothering him. If practice before the race was par-
ticularly out of control, a driver may warn his fellow competitors that the
race isn’t necessarily won by who goes the fastest — it’s won by who goes
the fastest without getting into an accident. NASCAR officials warn the com-
petitors, too. Often at the drivers’ meeting, NASCAR officials tell the drivers,
“You can’t finish first unless you finish.”
Many times, the drivers’ meeting is held in an empty bay in the garage area,
where chairs are set up for the drivers and crew chiefs. Sometimes, when
there is enough room, fans are allowed to watch — but only from outside of
roped-off areas. If you have a garage pass, get to the area early because many
fans show up to see the proceedings. This is a great time to take a peek at
your favorite drivers and snap their pictures while they relax and interact
with other drivers. Don’t make noise, though, because NASCAR officials can
throw you out of the meeting area. You don’t want to storm the drivers and
69
Chapter 5: The Rules of the Road  

crew chiefs for autographs as they leave the meeting either. That’s one way to
upset them, particularly because they don’t have that much time to prepare
for the race. They’re trying to focus on the competition, not on the T-shirt
you want them to autograph.
Passing Those Picky Inspections
Long before drivers go to drivers’ meetings or teams put the final touches on
their cars, NASCAR officials have to approve their cars to race. Throughout
race weekend, NASCAR officials inspect cars to see whether teams are abiding
by the rules. If the cars pass inspection, officials give teams permission for their
cars to go on the track by placing a small sticker on the windshield. If they
don’t, teams must work on the cars until officials deem them ready to race.
A race weekend in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, the NASCAR Busch
Series, and the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series usually begins on Fridays —
and inspections begin not long after the garage opens that morning. Teams
arrive at the garage early and start preparing their cars for NASCAR inspec-
tors to examine. If the car doesn’t pass inspection the first time through,
team members know right away that the weekend won’t be an easy one.
In this section, I give you the ins and outs of the entire inspection process.
Surviving the initial inspection
The initial inspection begins the morning the track opens, when each car is
put on four stands without its tires. Throughout the weekend, inspectors do a
quick check of the following:
 Body: Even though NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing involves only
Fords, Chevrolets, and Dodges, there’s a lot of room for tweaking. So offi-
cials must make sure that each of the cars conforms to a certain shape.
No missiles or bullet trains allowed. They inspect the shapes of the vari-
ous makes by using more than a dozen templates (see Figure 5-1), which
are form-fitting aluminum sheets placed on various parts of the car body,
such as the doors or the hood and roofline. If there’s a significant gap
between the car body and the template, the inspectors won’t approve
the car to go onto the track until the fabricators reshape the body to
make it fit.
 Safety belts and nets: An inspector takes a quick look around the inside
to make sure all the safety features are in order, especially the seatbelts
and the window net. The seatbelts strap the driver in with five adjoining
belts, while the window net is a piece of mesh fastened to the inside of
the window to keep the driver’s head or arms from coming out of the
70
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

window during an accident. To make sure these items work, the inspec-
tor checks whether they’re made of the correct material, that they’re
properly attached to the car, and that their locking mechanisms are
functioning.
 Roll bars: If a driver rolls his car over, the roll bars are designed to pro-
tect the roof from caving in and crushing him. Roll bars now extend
down the sides of the cars and help protect drivers in collisions with
other cars. An inspector checks these bars with a special instrument 
to make sure the diameter and thickness of the steel tubing is correct.
 Fuel cell (or gas tank): Officials check the fuel cell to make sure it holds
the correct amount of fuel (22 gallons) and that it has a foam rubber inte-
rior to prevent it from breaking open and spilling gasoline. The inspector
also takes a look at the check-valve, which prevents fuel spills if the car
turns over.
 Engine volume and compression ratio: Even though the engine is
checked more thoroughly in subsequent inspections, officials like to give
it a once-over during the initial inspection. They check to see whether
the engine is the right size and whether the compression ratio is correct.
Bigger engines (with more volume) produce more horsepower. Higher
compression ratios produce more power, too.
 Metal check: To ensure teams aren’t cheating by substituting a lighter
material, such as titanium, for steel (to make their car lighter and faster),
inspectors go over the main parts of the car with a magnet. If the magnet
doesn’t stick, they’ve caught a team trying to break the rules.
If officials catch teams cheating or see something they don’t like in this initial
inspection, they can ask teams to fix or replace the part or parts in question.
If NASCAR gives them an initial okay, the team’s next step is to head for a
more thorough inspection.

Chapter 5: The Rules of the Road  

Heading to the inspection line
Even though a team may have gotten through the initial inspection, inspec-
tions aren’t done for the day. Before qualifying, teams must take their car
through a technical inspection line where several officials look at their car.
Cars go through tech, which is NASCAR lingo for technical inspection, at the
following times:
 Before the first practice of the race weekend.
 Before qualifying.
 After qualifying if they win the pole.
 Just before the race, which is why you may see a line of cars snaking
through the garage the morning of race day, with crew members shep-
herding their cars through the line.
In the inspection line, officials conduct a more thorough check of the cars. If
a car fails just one part of the multi-step inspection, the team has to roll the
car back to the garage and fix the item in question. Then the team must roll
the car through the inspection line again, whether it cuts into practice time
or not. When the team gets to the front of the line, officials don’t only check
the item that didn’t pass the initial inspection — they inspect every part of
the car all over again. That’s just to make sure the team didn’t fiddle with
anything when they went back to the garage area. If the car passes the
inspection, officials put a sticker on the car’s windshield indicating it can go
out on the track.
For some teams, inspections continue after the race ends. Certain cars,
including the winner’s, must be inspected one more time before teams pack
up and go home. Check out the “Even when a car wins, it’s not over” section
later in this chapter for more on post-race inspections.
In the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, inspection officials review the following:
 Weight: Crew members push their car through the inspection line with
the car’s engine off. In order to be weighed, the car must go through
inspection wet, which means filled with fuel, oil, and water. Without the
driver, NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars must weigh at least 3,400 pounds,
with at least 1,600 pounds of that weight on the right side.
 Height: As the car rolls on the scales, it also rolls under an arch of metal
with a pin attached to its center. That pin reaches down to the car’s roof,
measuring the roof height of the vehicle. NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
cars must be a minimum of 51 inches.
 Ground clearance: Teams always want their cars to be as low to the
ground as possible (without scraping the ground, of course) so that
their cars can cut through the air easily. But NASCAR wants to make 
sure those cars aren’t too low. Officials measure the ground clearance 
72
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

at various points on the vehicle, ensuring teams aren’t trying to get 
their cars to squat lower than the rules allow in order to get an unfair
advantage.
 Compression ratio and engine displacement: Inspectors use instru-
ments to ensure the compression ratio is 12:1. With higher ratios,
engines produce more power. Inspectors also do a check for the overall
engine displacement, which reveals the volume of the engine. NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series engines must be a maximum of 358 cubic inches. Any
bigger, and those engines would generate more horsepower. Inspectors
also check one of the engine’s eight cylinders — a different cylinder every
time — each week to keep teams on their toes and make sure no one is
cheating.
 Safety: As with the initial check, NASCAR officials examine the inside of
the car, looking for sharp edges on which a driver could injure himself.
They also check the safety belts and window nets for wear and tear.
 Rear spoiler: The rear spoiler is a piece of metal that runs the width of
the car and is attached to the car’s trunk. It plays a big role in deter-
mining how air flows over the car and how much downforce is created,
which affects speed and handling (see Chapter 13). Officials check the
height of the spoiler, from the top of the spoiler to where it meets the
top of the trunk and also check the angle of the spoiler to ensure it meets
NASCAR standards. NASCAR also uses the spoiler to help regulate the
performance of the three car makes and keep them as even as possible.
For instance, if the Fords are underperforming compared to the Dodges
and Chevys, NASCAR may try to even the gap by increasing the size of
the Ford spoiler or by reducing the size of the Chevy and Dodge spoilers,
which increases or reduces downforce, allowing a car to go fractionally
faster or slower.
 Templates: Each brand of car or truck has a set of templates — individual
pieces of metal that conform to the body of a car — that ensure the car
fits NASCAR specifications (see Figure 5-2). Each piece conforms to the
car in different places — including the nose, the length of the body, and
the width of the body — making it a metal blueprint for the shape of a
car’s exterior. In NASCAR’s NEXTEL Cup Series, my Ford Taurus has at
least 18 of those templates. 
When drivers are fast, officials 
say “not so fast”
Think a team is off the hook just because their car passed through tech
before it went on the track for practice? Not yet. NASCAR officials want to
73
Chapter 5: The Rules of the Road  

make sure teams aren’t cheating, so they make cars go through tech inspec-
tion several other times during a race weekend, including just before qualifying
(see Chapter 8 for more on qualifying). Afterward, they have to take their place
in line on pit road to wait for qualifying to begin — so no chance to go back
to the garage and tweak a little bit.

The top five qualifiers go through inspection again, where officials check
height, weight, and the car’s body. Even then, the car of the pole winner, who
had the fastest qualifying lap, isn’t finished with inspection. Prior to the race,
pole-winning team members must tear down or take apart the car’s engine
while officials watch. When they have the engine in pieces, officials check
everything over again to make sure that the engine is the right size and that
all the parts conform to NASCAR rules.
Even though NASCAR officials do a great job inspecting cars, teams standing
in line waiting for inspection also police each other. If something on a car
looks funny, other teams are often the first to protest, and NASCAR doesn’t
mind. Other racers are NASCAR’s second defense against rule breakers, and
the intensity of the competition between the teams helps keep racing fair.
Special tests for special tracks
NASCAR officials use an especially thorough process to inspect cars at Daytona
International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, the sport’s biggest
S

Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

tracks. (Turn to Chapter 13 to get a more detailed look at those two tracks.)
Officials conduct special tests at those tracks to ensure driver and fan safety
because of the high speeds — upwards of 190 mph — that cars run there.
At Daytona and Talladega, where carburetor restrictor plates are required to
reduce horsepower and slow cars down, an official handles the restrictor
plates at all times. (See Chapter 13 for more on restrictor plates.) Teams
receive their restrictor plates when they go through inspection, but they can’t
just grab one and slap it on their car’s carburetor; it’s a carefully regulated
process. A team member reaches over a barrier to choose a plate randomly;
then an official lifts the plate over his head for everyone to see. After that,
the official places the restrictor plate on a pole that measures the diameter
of the opening, ensuring it’s the same size as every one else’s restrictor plate.
Finally, he places the plate on the car’s engine — see Figure 5-3. Then the engine
is sealed with an official NASCAR seal to make sure none of the teams tamper
with the engine after it passes inspection.

NASCAR officials take the inspection process at superspeedways further than
at other tracks. They often X-ray parts of a car’s engine after the races, nearly
eliminating the chance of a team getting away with even the smallest infrac-
tion. If there are holes in the carburetor, even ones the naked eye can’t see,
more air leaks into the engine — and the car goes faster, defeating the pur-
pose of the restrictor plates. NASCAR ensures that no holes exist.
Even when a car wins, it’s not over
Even after the cars cross the finish line and the winner drives into Victory
Lane, the inspection process isn’t over. In fact, the hardest part is yet to
come. After a driver wins a race, officials follow his car into Victory Lane and
watch over it — just to make sure his team doesn’t tamper with it while he
poses for pictures or sprays champagne over the crowd. After the driver and
his team are done whooping it up, the team rolls the car to the gas pumps to
fill the fuel cell. The other cars that finished in the top five have already filled
up their fuel cells. Then the top five cars go through inspection again, during
which NASCAR officials weigh them — which is why they need to fill their gas
tanks — and place templates on the bodies for the last time.
The battery of inspections continues: The top two or three cars — depending
on how many NASCAR officials choose — head for an empty garage to be
inspected again. Another car, chosen randomly, also gets the privilege of 
joining them. (The first driver who falls out of the race because of an acci-
dent or mechanical failure picks a number out of a hat — whichever car 
finishes in that place becomes the random car to be torn down.) Having
a random car torn down is the way NASCAR officials can police cars that 
consistently finish out of the top five.
Unlike other inspections during the weekend, post-race inspections can take
several hours because the teams have to do a thorough tear-down, taking
apart the engine, the suspension, the power train, and whatever else officials
want to check out. Officials check not only for obviously illegal parts, but also
for parts not approved by NASCAR (which may have been modified in hidden
places) and illegal additives used in the fuel. Those things may appear legal
at first glance.
Here’s a quick post-race inspection list:
 Engine: size, compression and so on
 Ignition
 Rear-end gear
 Fuel tank
 Body
76
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

 Power train
 Fuel (fuel additives)
While teams are happy to win a race, they aren’t so thrilled about their post-
celebration work at tear-downs. At that point, they’ve had a long day, often
beginning before dawn, and want to go home. When NASCAR officials finally
give a team the okay, they place all the car’s engine parts into a box to be
shipped back in the team truck. The team must put the engine back together
at another time, which isn’t a big deal because teams use different cars at 
different tracks anyway. Each team has a fleet of about 12 cars at their shop,
each built specifically for a different type of racetrack — some for super-
speedways, some for high-banked tracks, some for road courses — all covered
in Chapter 13. (Flip to Chapter 4 to find out more about engines and what
teams do to prepare them for a race.)
Being Creative with the Rules
NASCAR racing has become so competitive — with so much money at 
stake — that teams do everything possible to get an edge on the competition.
Getting around the rules has lots of names — interpreting the rules, reading
between the lines, using the gray area, or being creative.
Take the templates as an example. Back when templates first came out, there
were only two or three of them. So even though teams had to build their car
to fit those two or three templates, they did whatever they wanted on every
other part of their cars. Now, even though more than a dozen templates exist
for each car, teams do the same thing. That’s why NASCAR officials keep
adding more and more templates — because teams keep trying to get around
the rules.
Here are some of the ways teams try to skirt the rules:
 Body: Teams can get an aerodynamic advantage by putting all sorts of
nearly indistinguishable bumps and ruts into a car’s body.
 Tires: NASCAR officials don’t routinely check teams’ tires, so some have
tried to use that to their advantage. Teams have soaked or chemically
treated the tires to make them softer to get a better grip on the track —
which does make the car faster, but only for short runs because the
soaked or altered tires aren’t very durable. If NASCAR officials think a
team may be treating tires, they confiscate them for careful inspection,
which in the past has even included shipping the tires off for a detailed
chemical analysis by an independent laboratory.
 Engine: Teams try to lower the motor mounts, where the motor sits in
relation to the body of the car, so that the car has a lower center of grav-
ity and handles better.
77
Chapter 5: The Rules of the Road  

 Roof flaps or other parts: To lighten the car, teams constantly try to figure
out how to make parts out of lighter material — which is illegal in certain
cases where parts must be made out of NASCAR-mandated materials,
such as steel. Still, teams are constantly substituting those materials for
lighter ones when they install roof flaps, drive shafts, wheel hubs, suspen-
sion components, or even nuts or bolts on the engine. They can also drill
holes in these parts, another way to make the car lighter. Teams transfer
the weight they save to a spot lower on the car to improve handling.
While figuring out ways to bend rules can be quite a creative process, if a team
is caught cheating, NASCAR is pretty tough on it. If officials discover something
illegal on your car after qualifying but before the race, they make the crew fix
or replace the part, and later slap the team with a big fine or put the crew chief
on probation, or both. Being on probation means that if a team member is
caught doing anything illegal again, he can be temporarily or permanently
kicked out of the garage. If NASCAR officials discover an illegal part on a car
after the race, then they usually fine the driver or take points away from him.
NASCAR inspections have become so thorough that the amount of cheating
going in NASCAR garages is a fraction of what it was 20 or 30 years ago.
Watching the Flagman
After all the inspections, cars are ready to get out on the track. From that
point on, keep your eye on the flagman, who is perched above the racetrack
at the start/finish line in a crow’s nest of sorts (see Figure 5-4).

78
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

If you’re not sure what all those flags he’s waving around are, here’s the 
lowdown:
 Green: To keep things simple, green means go. The flagman waves the
green flag to signal the start of the race. During the pace laps, which are
run at a slower pace so that cars can warm up their engines and tires, a
pace car with flashing yellow lights on its roof leads the field. Just before
the race starts, the pace car peels off onto pit road as the flagman waves
the green flag. Then, they’re off!
 Yellow: The yellow flag, or caution flag, comes out when drivers need to
slow down because the track is unsafe. This happens in the event of an
accident, rain, or when debris or oil is on the track. When the yellow flag
is waved, drivers can’t race or pass each other. The position of each car
in the field is frozen at the moment when the yellow flag flew. Until late
2003, drivers were allowed to “race back to the yellow” because the cau-
tion period didn’t formally begin until the leader crossed the start-finish
line. Often, a driver with a big lead would slow his car on the way to the
line to allow lapped cars to make up a lap. To compensate for the elimi-
nation of this tactic, NASCAR instituted a new rule that allows the first
car one lap down to pass the pace car and make up his lost lap. This rule
immediately became known as the “Lucky Dog Rule.”
Some fans don’t appreciate paying to attend a NASCAR race, only to see
it end under a caution flag — which is completely understandable. For
me, though, ending under a caution flag is just fine. As for late-race re-
starts, if I were assured no accidents would happen on the final lap and
that every driver would use his head, I wouldn’t mind it. After all, the
fans are the reason that NASCAR is so popular, and I’m all for giving
them a good race. 
Drivers don’t always feel the same way when a caution comes out.
Sometimes, they are happy about it because they need a pit stop for gas
or fresh tires, or because the car in the lead is a mile ahead of everyone
and cars are bunched back up for a restart after a caution, bringing every-
one closer to the leader. Sometimes, though, a driver hates to see a caution
flag — especially when he’s leading by a mile or when his car drives better
after long runs at full speed.
 Green-White-Checkered Sequence: In an attempt to finish races under
green-flag conditions, NASCAR in 2004 introduced the green-white-
checkered flag sequence. This is used when a yellow flag flies with just
a few laps remaining and the race would otherwise have finished under
caution. The new procedure consists of a restart of two laps — the green
flag for the first lap of the restart and the white flag signaling the final
lap leading to the checkered flag. Used only during the last two sched-
uled laps of a race, the new format does not guarantee a green-flag
finish, as only one restart under the green-white-checkered format will
S

Chapter 5: The Rules of the Road  

be attempted. If a caution comes out during that period, the race is fin-
ished. This procedure eliminates the need for a red flag in the final laps
to immediately stop the race in an attempt to finish under green-flag
conditions. One offshoot of the new rule is that crew chiefs have to
recalculate gas mileage, as under regular racing conditions most cars
have the exact amount of fuel needed to finish the race as regularly
scheduled. With events possibly being extended by two laps, a crew
chief has to decide whether to stop late in the race for a splash of gas
or gamble that it will finish on the designated lap.
 Red: If there’s too much oil or fluid covering the track surface, it’s rain-
ing so much that drivers can’t see the track, or a damaged wall or fence
makes the track unsafe or impossible for cars to continue to circle the
track under caution, a red flag comes out. When a red flag waves, cars
must stop in line behind the pace car at the spot on the track where the
pace car comes to a stop. During red flags for rain, however, they park in
their pit stalls. Depending on how long a race is under the red flag, drivers
may sit in their cars, get out and talk with one another, or — during a
long rain delay — head for their trailers parked in the infield.
 Black: A black flag signals to a driver that he must get off the track and
go to his pits. This happens when something is wrong with his car, such
as oil leaking or smoke billowing from the exhaust, which may create a
dangerous situation for other cars on the track. The black flag can also
come out when a driver breaks the rules, like when he jumps the start.
When a driver is black-flagged, he knows it. Not only does the flagman
wave that ominous, dark flag at him, but his car number is also dis-
played at the start/finish line so drivers know exactly who’s in trouble.
A driver can’t really ignore getting black flagged, either, and just stay
out on the track to race, because at some point, officials get peeved and
the flagman breaks out a black flag with a white “X” on it, indicating the
driver won’t be scored any longer. In that case, a driver should give up
and head to the pits.
 Blue with diagonal yellow stripe: When a driver sees this flag, it signi-
fies that faster, lead-lap cars are about to pass him and he has to yield to
those cars. A flagman usually waves this flag at a driver who is one lap
down and is significantly slower than the cars racing for the win.
 White: This flag signals that the driver in the lead is on his final lap.
 Checkered: When a flagman waves the checkered flag, the winner is
crossing the finish line.

 Figuring out who’s in charge
 Understanding what a crew chief does
 Identifying team members at the track
 Finding out about the people behind the scenes
You may not think of stock-car racing as a team sport. Racing certainly
seems like an individual sport because the driver gets most of the atten-
tion. While a driver is arguably the most important part of a race team, he
isn’t the only reason a team wins or loses. Dozens of people work on a race
team and contribute to the performance of a car every weekend. From the
owner to the crew chief, the engine builder, and the guy who orders parts,
everyone on a team has to work well — together — in order for the team to
succeed (see Figure 6-1).

Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 
Consider the driver racing’s version of a quarterback. Even a good quarter-
back can’t accomplish much if his team lets him get sacked.
The Owner Is the Boss
In NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing, just as in any sport, the players — in
this case, the drivers — get most of the credit. But drivers wouldn’t have jobs
if somebody didn’t employ them. The person who employs NASCAR drivers
is the team owner.
Characteristics of a good owner
The owner has the final say in hiring everyone who works on the team, 
from the driver to the crew chief to everyone who prepares the cars for
racing. The owner spends money on cars and parts, which are quite pricey.
For example, tires cost nearly $400 apiece. But a far larger expense is all the
cash the owner shells out for payroll — which isn’t cheap, considering how
competitive the sport is and how valuable talented employees are. With all
those bills to pay and paychecks to sign, an owner has to be a shrewd and
savvy businessperson. The owner has to do one thing first: secure a sponsor.
The owner approaches large corporations and asks for anywhere from $4 to
$10 million to sponsor a race team for the season. The owner has to convince
the companies that paying that kind of money will lead to exposure, and ulti-
mately, better sales for their product. To get sponsors, the owner needs to
understand the business world beyond the business of running a race team.
But he or she also needs to know racing. An owner has to be able to recog-
nize driving talent on the racetrack, and much like a team owner or a coach
in other sports, needs to be able to create an environment in which that
talent can flourish.
Car numbers are the owners’ domain
Car numbers are assigned by NASCAR to team
owners. Although drivers change teams, the car
number they previously drove remains the
domain of the team owner, as long as the owner
remains active. For example, when Bill Elliott
began driving a reduced schedule in 2004, his
replacement, Kasey Kahne, became the driver
of the No. 9 Dodge and Elliott drove the new No.
98 Dodge.

83
Chapter 6: Working Together: The Race Team
Most NASCAR owners are men, just as most drivers and team members are, 
but several women own teams. Georgetta Roush, the mother of Jack Roush, my
team owner, owns one of Roush Racing’s five teams, but she isn’t involved in the
day-to-day operations of the team, as is the case for many female team owners.
Some NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series team owners have become as famous and
as popular as their drivers, and some fans have a stronger allegiance to a
team owner than they do to a driver. So, they’ll cheer for any car, for exam-
ple, that Robert Yates owns — no matter who’s behind the wheel.
The following are a few of the more famous — perhaps even legendary —
NASCAR team owners today:
 Richard Childress: Childress was the long-time car owner of one of the
most famous drivers in NASCAR history — seven-time NASCAR Cup
champion Dale Earnhardt. Together, the Childress-Earnhardt No. 3
Chevy team won six titles. Childress was a race car driver before decid-
ing to go the ownership route, which turned out quite well for him. He
didn’t win any NASCAR Cup Series races as a driver, but has won more
than 76 races as a car owner.
S
Good team owners don’t come around often
My car owner, Jack Roush, is in my opinion the
best team owner in racing. I also consider him
my surrogate father, since my father, Julian, died
in a plane crash in August 1998. Jack has looked
out for me since we teamed up in 1988 on his
new NASCAR Cup Series race team, and we’ve
been together ever since, through the good times
(winning races and nearly winning the NASCAR
Cup championship) and the bad times (going
winless throughout the entire 1996 season). It’s
not an exaggeration to say that I wouldn’t have
been as successful if it weren’t for Jack Roush.
The best relationships between owners and dri-
vers are the ones with give and take, and lots of
trust. You can see that trust in the top driver-
owner relationships, including the one between
Jack Roush and me and between Rick Hendrick
and Jeff Gordon. Without mutual trust, Jack and
I would have had less success.
Jack and I get along well right now because
we’re both proud of the team we’ve built and the
success we’ve had in recent years. Also, Jack
and I have similar approaches to dealing with the
team and the race car. He’s one of the most
hands-on owners in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
racing, overseeing everything for each of his
race teams, from the engine program to the body
shop to the processes at the racetrack. And I’m
one of the more hands-on drivers in the series,
working with the crew chief, car chief, and
engine specialist to understand exactly how the
car is working and precisely what can be done
to make it go faster. Some owners and drivers sit
back and let the team figure things out, which
definitely isn’t our style. Jack and I are similar in
the way we do things — and we both care about
making our team as good as possible.

84
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 
 Rick Hendrick: Hendrick became a NASCAR Cup Series team owner in
1984 with Geoffrey Bodine as driver and then became one of the first
multi-car team owners (see the “Multi-car teams — the more the merrier”
section) in the series. From 1995 to 1998, Hendrick won four consecutive
championships — with Terry Labonte behind the wheel in 1996 and Jeff
Gordon winning in the other three years.
 Roger Penske: Penske’s love for racing began as an open-wheel car
driver when he was young. He then branched out into ownership. He
owns the teams of Rusty Wallace, Ryan Newman, and Brendan Gaughan,
and also owns teams in the IRL series featuring open-wheel cars, where
his cars have won a record 13 Indianapolis 500s. (Turn to Chapter 1 for
more on open-wheel cars.)
 Richard Petty: Petty is known as the king of stock-car racing not only
because of his seven NASCAR Cup Series championships and NASCAR-
record 200 wins, but also because he’s been a successful car owner 
and has always made himself accessible to the fans throughout his long
and famous career. The Petty family has always fielded its own cars, so
Richard knows what he’s doing as a car owner. When Petty first began
driving in 1958, many drivers owned their cars and teams because it 
was so much less expensive than today, and because they wouldn’t have
been able to race if they didn’t. Petty stayed an owner even as NASCAR
changed and costs skyrocketed. It helped that STP oil treatment was his
longtime sponsor (replaced now by Cheerios). It’s has also helped that
he won so many championships and races. Petty Enterprises also fields
the No. 45 car driven by his son Kyle.
 The Wood Brothers: Len and Eddie Wood have been involved in NASCAR
since their father, Glen, began racing in 1953 — just a few years after
NASCAR was founded. The two sons continue the family tradition with
one of the most famous and longest-running teams in the business. Ricky
Rudd drives the Wood Brothers’ No. 21 Ford, which has logged at least
one victory in each of the last five decades, and almost 100 overall.
 Robert Yates: Team owner Robert Yates, perhaps the best engine builder
in NASCAR, finally won a championship in 1999 after years of coming
close. Dale Jarrett, one of his two drivers, dominated most of the season
in the No. 88 Ford to win the title. Some of NASCAR’s greatest drivers
have driven for Yates since he became a team owner in 1989, including
the late Davey Allison, who drove the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford.
Jarrett and Elliott Sadler are teammates in Yates’s two-car operation.
The sponsor doesn’t give commands
Even though sponsors — the companies that pay for the right to have their
names on cars — pay most of the bills, they don’t get to hang out at the race
shop as much as they may want or give advice to drivers on how to make

85
Chapter 6: Working Together: The Race Team
their cars run faster. Although some sponsors show up at the race shop more
often than others, the role of a sponsor is usually limited to paying the bills
or handling marketing.
Some sponsors don’t like this limited role very much. Considering how much
cash their companies are laying out, some sponsors feel they should have a
say in how a race team functions, meaning which driver to hire, and which
changes should be made to the race car. When a sponsor starts making those
sorts of decisions, however, it’s almost never good for the race team — unless
that sponsor has been a successful NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series team owner,
driver, or crew chief! Running a race team is usually best left to the people
involved in racing: Those who know the business and are responsible for a
team’s performance on the track. Everyone else should just enjoy the results.
Multi-car teams — the more the merrier
In the old days, guys used to haul one car down to the track, gather up who-
ever was around to change tires or fill up the tank during pit stops, and go
racing. Even when the sport got more technical in the 1970s and 1980s, one
owner usually employed one driver and had one race team.
S
When teaming up pays off
When I started racing for Jack Roush in 1988, I
was his only driver and my team was the only
NASCAR Cup Series team Jack had to worry
about. But Jack was one of the first owners to
realize the benefits of owning two teams. So
in 1992, I had my first teammate — Wally
Dallenbach, Jr. And on paper, it paid off. I won
twice that year, was second five more times, and
had 17 top-ten finishes all together. Today Jack
has five NASCAR Cup teams, with myself and
drivers Matt Kenseth (the 2003 NASCAR Cup
champion), Kurt Busch, Greg Biffle, and Carl
Edwards. The five of us have a similar approach
to racing, so it’s easy to communicate about
what’s going on with our cars and what we
should tell our crew chiefs.
Our crews work well together, too, telling
each other what we’ve learned and making
suggestions for how we can each go faster. I’ve
even got my hand in the ownership of one team.
I think getting the teams to work together helps
all of us have more success.
On the track, the teammate relationship exists —
but to a much lesser extent. If I’m leading a race
and Matt or another teammate had an earlier
problem and is a lap down but still running strong,
I may let him get back on the lead lap by allowing
him to pass me. Or if one of my teammates has a
faster car than I do and I know it, I may not try to
fight him off — I’ll probably just allow him to pass.
But believe me, if I were battling for the win with
one of my teammates, I’d race him just as hard
as I would anyone else. Even though we’re
teammates, we still want to kick the pants off
each other.
S

That’s not the case any more. One of the most crucial components in being
successful in racing is information: what a crew learns about the car and the
tracks, what makes a car go faster, and what doesn’t. With more money
coming into the sport during the 1990s, owners quickly realized that one way
to get more information was to use more than one team. When an owner has
only one driver and team, he only has one source of information. But when
he adds another team, he gets more — and better — information.
NASCAR limits teams to five two-day and four single-day test sessions, so an
owner who has multiple teams multiplies his test dates. (Rookies are allowed
seven two-day tests and five single-day tests to gain extra experience.) At the
racetrack, multi-car teams can do a bit of experimenting. One car can run a
particular setup — spring ratios and tire pressures and other things — while
another tries something slightly different. As practice goes on, the crews deter-
mine which car handles better and which one runs faster. After practice is
over, they can exchange the data and determine which setup is best, although
different drivers sometimes prefer a different feel to the car, so teams may
have to incorporate further adjustments to set up each individual car for a
multi-car team.
Because the demand for information has grown so much in recent years, it
has become harder and harder for single-car teams to survive. One team
owner with one car simply can’t learn enough about new tracks and new
technologies to compete against the multi-car teams and really hope to con-
tend for a championship. So as stock-car racing moves into the 21st century,
expect the majority of owners to field more than one car in each race.
Many multi-car teams have several different owners on paper. Only two
teams per owner are eligible for NASCAR’s bonus programs. (See Chapter 12
for a list of bonus programs.) Those programs can generate a good deal of
money, depending on a team’s performance, so every team owner wants to
be involved — even it means fudging a bit when it come to team ownership.
Team Managers Organize the Operation
When I started racing, I thought of a team manager as the kid in high school
who got water and cleaned towels for the football team. But in racing, the
team manager serves as the owner’s representative in the shop: someone
who oversees everything, including ordering equipment, hiring personnel,
and organizing test sessions. There are just too many details for the owner
86
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

and crew chief to deal with, so the team manager position was created. Not
every race team has a team manager, but anytime a team can have another
experienced person around, it’s bound to help. Just don’t confuse him with
the guy who’s supposed to get water for the driver.
The team manager is usually someone with a lot of experience working on race
cars, often someone who had been a long-time crew chief, but wanted to step
back and take a more administrative role. The team manager isn’t hands-on
when it comes to how the car is running at a specific time, but is entrusted
with hiring candidates for specific jobs.
After the team is assembled, the team manager’s job is to get the people to
work together, to make sure each individual person is doing his individual job.
He works closely with the crew chief in overseeing everyone, and — if the
owner owns more than one race team — he makes sure the teams are working
together, sharing ideas and information that may benefit both on race day.
The Crew Chief: A Race 
Team’s Head Honcho
No driver can will a lousy car into Victory Lane. It just can’t happen. Racing
isn’t like other sports, where the equipment is the same across the board.
Michael Jordan didn’t suddenly have to shoot a deflated basketball while the
other team got to use the regular kind. Mark McGwire didn’t have to swing a
hollow bat while everyone else got a solid one. But some days, drivers are
presented with race cars that just aren’t fast enough to win.
That’s where the crew chief comes in. A crew chief oversees everyone in the
shop to make sure they’re building cars that will go fast on the racetrack. He
works from his own experience and whatever notes he may keep on how cars
have reacted in the past on certain tracks under certain conditions. The crew
chief tells each of the workers under him the specifications for doing their jobs,
both at the shop and at the racetrack. He determines how the car bodies are
built, how the springs and shocks are adjusted, what level of air pressure to
run the tires at — everything. It’s a big job. Because of that, he usually works
longer hours than anyone on the team, looking at numbers and considering
possibilities. A great crew chief needs to know everything about a race car,
his driver, and the track he’s going to run next.
87
Chapter 6: Working Together: The Race Team

Although drivers get a lot of attention, crew chiefs have started to become
stars in their own right, too. The top crew chiefs have their own trading cards,
and they’re often asked to sign nearly as many autographs as the drivers — all
for doing a job that used to be considered anonymous and not very glamorous.
They deserve all the attention they get, though, because they have as much
to do with success as anyone involved. Here are two of the better-known
crew chiefs: 
 Ray Evernham: Some people say Jeff Gordon wouldn’t have won his first
three championships without Evernham setting up his cars and talking him
through a race. That may or may not be true, but there’s no doubt that
Evernham and Gordon had one of the best combinations in racing when
they were together. They had that special chemistry that a team needs to
win races. Saying he needed a bigger challenge, Evernham left the team
in late 1999 to become a car owner and field a multi-car Dodge effort.
 Robin Pemberton: Pemberton was my crew chief from 1988 to 1991; his
brother, Ryan, also is a crew chief on the circuit, so technical skills run in
the Pemberton family. Robin left my team to be Kyle Petty’s crew chief,
but not because we had a falling out. He just needed to move on with
his career and pursue other challenges. In August 2004, Pemberton was
named NASCAR’s Vice President of Competition.
88
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 
A good crew chief is hard to find
When I raced in the American Speed Association
(ASA) Series, a non-NASCAR stock-car series
based in the Midwest, I worked with crew chief
Jimmy Fennig. We hit it off right away. He was
as intensely dedicated to racing as I was, so it
was a perfect match. Jimmy and I won the 1986
ASA championship in just our second year
together. In those two years, we won nine races
and 13 poles, which is amazing considering we
hadn’t worked with each other for that long. We
couldn’t stay together forever, though. While he
was the crew chief in 1986 when I ran my first
five NASCAR Cup races, I wasn’t ready to drive
full time in the series — and he was, so he had
to move on without me. Jimmy, who is from
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, worked with NASCAR
Cup champion Bobby Allison and almost a
dozen other drivers until we decided to work
together again in 1996 — and that’s one of the
best moves either of us ever made, considering
what great chemistry there was between us,
even after all those years apart. In 1998, we won
seven races, the most I’ve ever won in a season,
and finished second in the championship. Without
Jimmy, I couldn’t have done that.
One thing that doesn’t change in NASCAR, how-
ever, is that everything does change. It’s difficult
to sustain an ideal driver–crew chief relationship
over the long haul, especially during a slump.
Jimmy eventually moved on to another of Jack’s
teams. He is now Kurt Busch’s crew chief and
they’ve been terrific together. I’ve now got Pat
Tryson as crew chief, and we work great together,
too; plus he’s assembled one of the best crews
I’ve ever had.
S

If You Need Something Done, 
Go to the Car Chief
Racing has gotten so big over the past few years that owners have had to add
another layer of management to their teams — the car chief. The car chief is
the person who works closely with the crew chief in figuring out setups for
the car, but is the actual guy who makes sure it gets done. That allows the
crew chief more time to work on a computer or look through notes to figure
out better setups and to work on race strategy. When the crew chief does
decide on a setup, he discusses it with the car chief — and then the car chief
goes to the garage and implements the changes. The car chief gathers other
crew members together, tells them what to do, and then rolls up his sleeves
and helps get the job done.
Believe It or Not, the Driver Does 
More Than Drive the Car
The driver often ends up getting all of the credit — and a lot of the blame —
for how a race team performs. But when you look at the team picture, the
driver is just one part. That’s particularly true before the race starts.
During the week leading up to a race, the driver may or may not come to the
race shop where the cars are being prepared. The crew chief has conversations
with the driver about how the car should be set up, but for the most part, the
team does all the work at the shop.
89
Chapter 6: Working Together: The Race Team
Meeting the team scorer
On race day, each team has its own scorer who
counts how many laps a car has made around
the track. He or she scores laps by hand (using
a good, old-fashioned pen and a piece of paper),
but computers also are used. For the official
tally, NASCAR Timing & Scoring has an elec-
tronic system which keeps track of cars on the
speedway. Each car has a transponder (a small
box) attached to its underside. That transpon-
der transmits a signal to NASCAR computers
every time it completes a lap. That’s how
NASCAR knows exactly the position of each car
and how many laps it’s run, just in case teams
question it.

After everyone arrives at the track for a race, teams try to improve their cars
during practice sessions (when drivers complete laps around the track, and
then come into the garage to tell their crew chiefs what the car is doing).
Drivers describe whether the car is reacting correctly to the track and where
it needs to go faster — on the corners or in the straightaway. The crew chief
then determines which adjustments to make.
After the race starts, the driver’s role may seem rather obvious — get to the
finish line before everyone else. But it’s a little more complicated than that.
I talk more about the driver’s role, and what he has to do during an entire
week, in Chapter 7.
Practice for a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race is some of the most important
time of the weekend. While the cars may appear to be simply going around in
circles, in reality, everyone is involved — the driver, the crew chief, the team
manager, and the crew. The team is finding out everything they need to know
about how the car will perform under race conditions.
Practice in stock-car racing is a little different than in other sports, in which
practice takes place behind closed doors. You don’t see the Packers practic-
ing in front of the Broncos before the Super Bowl. But in racing, everybody
gets to see how fast everyone else is running. (How a driver runs in practice
usually determines how fast he’ll be during a race.)
And the Rest of the Team . . .
Besides the owner, the crew chief, the car chief, and the driver, other team
members work the garage, too. Those team members do much more than
just strut around looking important. Even though they aren’t the primary
decision makers on a team, they’re important components to building a 
winning program. Keep in mind that not every team member goes to a race,
only a set group goes. The others stay at the race shop and work on cars for
future races. Here are some that go to the track:
 Engine specialist: The engine specialist, or engine tuner, is in charge of
taking care of the engines after they get to the racetrack. Engine special-
ists are the guys you see running around the garage with a tray of spark
plugs and a magnifying glass. The engine specialist reads a spark plug by
examining the insides of it and checking for signs of heat — color varia-
tions or spots. After reading spark plugs, the engine specialist determines
what he needs do in order to get the optimum power output from the
engine. The engine specialist is also responsible for the engine’s overall
health at the track.
90
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

 Tire specialist: The tire specialist isn’t tough to spot — he’s the guy who
spends the entire day hanging around the team’s tires, changing the air
pressure, checking the heat buildup, or measuring the wear of a tire after
it has taken a few laps on the track. The tire specialist uses an instrument
to figure out how the tire has worn in certain places — the inside, middle,
and outside of the tread. He also measures the temperature of the tire in
these locations to determine the heat buildup. The way a tire wears or
how hot it is in certain places reveals how the car is driving on the track.
If one tire is too hot in one spot or worn out in one specific place, crew
members change the car’s setup so that tires touch the racing surface
more evenly and smoothly — and many times, that means the car goes
faster. The measurements a tire specialist makes are miniscule, so the
job may seem insignificant, but it’s critical.
 Engineers: NASCAR racing prides itself on not using any onboard comput-
ers to maximize the car’s output the way other racing series do. Still, that
doesn’t mean NASCAR is dead set on staying behind the times. Over the
past few years, stock-car racing has seen an influx of engineers who’ve
used their advanced degrees to improve how a car runs. Many teams use
engineers to calculate the exact setup for a car on a certain track, including
precisely how each shock should be built, which springs should be used,
and what tire pressures will be best. Most teams have become so large
and specialized that they have one engineer specifically devoted to the
shock absorbers. At first, many old-timers in the sport — and some of the
young people — resented the engineers for bringing too much technology
to NASCAR, which had traditionally been a grass-roots sport. They felt that
stock-car racing should stay as basic as possible, and remain accessible
to people without fancy college degrees. But as racing has become more
competitive, engineers have become must-have additions to each team.
 General mechanics: While many team members have specialized titles
with specialized jobs, some are all-around workers who can do just about
anything. General mechanics can help the car chief set up the car, build
shocks back in the trailer, or rework the body of a car after a driver crashes
it into the wall. Every team has to have a few general mechanics to get
by — and I feel kind of funny saying that because in the past, everyone was
a general mechanic. But now it seems everything is changing and becom-
ing more specialized. Ask the shock builder how to change an engine
and he may laugh at you and run away (hopefully not with your shocks
in his hands). So every team has to have some people with versatility.
 Pit crew: A maximum of seven people are allowed to go over the pit wall
and service a car during a pit stop. Although some crew members —
mechanics, crew chiefs, car chiefs, and tire specialists — still do double
duty by working at the shop and pitting the car, some teams fly special-
ized pit crew members to the track on race morning. To find out more
about pit crews and pit stops, turn to Chapter 10.
91
Chapter 6: Working Together: The Race Team

 Truck driver: He isn’t the primary pilot, but a team’s truck driver has a
very important job. If the driver doesn’t do his job right, the team may
show up at the racetrack and not have any equipment. The driver must be
on time and be careful driving the rig with millions of dollars of equipment
in it. Once at the track, the truck driver also is responsible for keeping
the inside of the truck in order, and maintaining a complete inventory of
what is inside, including the following items:
• The primary car
• The backup car
• All the uniforms and equipment of the driver and crews
• Tool chests and the pit cart, which carries extra parts for the chas-
sis and engine from the garage to pit road
• Shock dynamometers to figure out how a shock reacts on the track
(see Chapter 4 for further explanation)
• Extra sheet metal, including noses, and rear sections for the car, in
case of an accident
• Cabinets and drawers filled with snacks for the team to munch on
during long days at the track
The team hauler is the place where the team members hang out when they’re
not working on the car. It’s a place to relax and grab some lunch — as well as a
place to hold ultra-serious meetings on how to make the race car better. Most
haulers have a lounge in front, equipped with a TV, stereo, desk, table and a
couple of comfortable couches. The team hauler is where a crew chief goes to
crunch numbers for setups, where a driver goes to take naps and where a team
owner goes to fire or hire a driver at the track. It’s the only private place in the
garage area where team members can sleep, hold meetings, or work in peace.

The team’s schedule
A race weekend in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series isn’t easy or relaxing for a race team. It
consists of several long, grueling days. The week-
ends usually begin on Thursday for the drivers
and teams, when they get on a plane to travel to
the racetrack. In the late afternoon or early
evening, teams and drivers arrive in the town
the race will be held, go to dinner, and then get
a good night’s sleep for Friday’s activities, which
usually consist of qualifying and practice ses-
sions. The team needs plenty of sleep because
the garage usually opens before dawn and closes
past dinnertime. Teams practice and qualify their
cars on Friday and Saturday; Sunday is race day,
of course.
Race weekends in the NASCAR Busch Series
and the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series aren’t
quite as exhausting because, most of the time,
they aren’t as long. Many events in those two
series last just two days, with qualifying on the
first day and the race on the second day.

The People behind the Scenes
The work doesn’t end when the race ends. Dozens of team members wait
back at the shop for the car to return from the race so they can fix it up and
prepare it for the next race it will run, whether the race is the following week
or in a month or two. They also build engines, build car bodies, and test
parts. Although the following team members work behind the scenes, they
shouldn’t be overlooked:
 Fabricators: Fabricators have a special talent. They take stock sheet metal
parts provided by the manufacturer and fasten them together on the car
frame before molding it all into a sleek, aerodynamic race car. They trim
the metal, then make it fit the car’s frame precisely — called hanging a
body in racing terms. If the body isn’t hung properly, the aerodynamics of
the car won’t be as good as they should be. And that slows the car down.
 Engine builders and engine assemblers: An engine doesn’t just show
up at a race shop ready to be put into a car. Unless a team leases its
engines from another engine builder, the engine builders on a team are
in charge of building the engine nearly from scratch. Engine builders
figure out how to make the engine as light, but durable, as possible.
Then engine assemblers put the engines together. The engine tuner, 
discussed in the “And the Rest of the Team . . .” section earlier in this
chapter, takes over from there.
 Parts specialists: At the race shop, teams have a specialist for everything.
For example, a suspension specialist is responsible for taking apart the
suspension from a race car that just raced, and then testing to see which
parts need to be replaced. Having tons of specialists running around
isn’t a bad thing, considering how much pressure there is to win races.
Teams can’t afford to lose races because some small, insignificant part
falls apart after too much use. That’s why everybody on the team is so
meticulous when building and improving the car.

espite what you may think, NASCAR drivers do much more than just
hop in their cars, drive around in circles, win races, and make money!
Much more goes into racing than that, so much so that test sessions, races,
sponsor luncheons, and commercial shoots take up nearly every second of a
driver’s day.
With so many non-racing activities filling a driver’s schedule, racers today must
be versatile — they must be great drivers, competent public speakers, astute
businessmen, and half-decent actors (though not necessarily Oscar winners).
The Role of the Driver 
on the Racing Team
Even though drivers are super-versatile, their primary job is to get into cars
and take chances for three or so hours every Sunday — and nothing will ever
change that. Drivers also have a better feel for their cars than anyone else, so
their feedback to their crews about how to make the cars race faster and
handle better on the track is crucial. My current crew is one of the best I’ve
ever had, but they’re not mind-readers, so it’s up to me to tell them what I
need them to do to make the car better.

A driver isn’t just a figurehead who gets all the credit and all the headlines in
the newspapers. He has to work to make his money, just like everybody else.
During practice, a driver doesn’t shut up
It’s not to a driver’s advantage to be shy when practice begins. It’s his job to
jabber about everything his car is doing to his team, face-to-face after he fin-
ishes the run or over the in-car radio. The more input the team gets about the
car, the better work they can perform.
Here’s a scenario of what the driver may say to his team throughout a typical
practice:
 The driver shows up for practice, dressed in his driving uniform, and
ready to go. He slides into his car and takes a few laps but notices the
car is loose as he enters the turns, meaning the rear of the car is starting
to fishtail because the rear tires are losing traction. He contacts his crew
via the in-car radio, tells them what’s going on, and then heads into the
garage.
 After the car rolls into the garage, the crew chief (or maybe the car
chief or the engine specialist) runs to the driver’s window to talk more
about what the car was doing. They may, for example, decide to change
the air pressure in one of the tires to see whether that does the trick. Of
course, they’re working in a rush because they only have a limited time
for practice — and it never seems like enough when your car isn’t run-
ning well and your team is scrambling to find out what’s wrong.
 The driver takes to the track with his new setup but quickly finds that
the car isn’t driving smoothly and that he’s having trouble turning the
car. There are several terms drivers and crew use to describe how their
car is handling. A car is loose when a driver goes through a turn and
the rear of his vehicle starts to fishtail, making the driver feel as if he’s
losing control and about to spin out. The rear tires aren’t sticking well to
the track and providing enough traction. When the front tires don’t turn
well through the turns because the front tires are losing traction before
the rear tires are, the car is tight. When a car is tight, it also means it’s
pushing, and if a driver isn’t careful, he will end up zooming into the wall.
Although driver input is critical in preparing the car for qualifying, sometimes —
although very rarely — the car runs perfectly after the team unloads it off the
truck. The driver has no complaints about the car during the first practice,
raving to his team the whole time about how great a job they did. When this
happens, a driver usually says his car was great right off the truck.
96
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

When the race starts, there’s no zoning out
When the green flag drops, the driver can’t be daydreaming about what he’s
going to eat for dinner. Not only does he have to concentrate on the racetrack,
but he also has to make some pretty important decisions like when to make
a pass, when to be patient, when to be aggressive, and when to save his tires
(to taking it easy through the turns and not running the car too hard). So,
even during a 600-mile race like the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor Speedway,
the longest NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race of the year, drivers must stay
focused at all times.
Staying focused for three or four hours, the length of a typical 400- or 500-mile
race, isn’t easy. Drivers must be mentally disciplined — constantly thinking
about their cars and how to make them drive better. The driver is in constant
contact with his crew chief throughout a race, exchanging information on the
car and what the team needs to do during a pit stop to help improve the car’s
performance. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on the action during pit stops.)
Some drivers talk over the radio during practice and races more than others.
I prefer to say one or two things to my crew chief from time to time instead of
talking over the radio throughout the race. That lets me concentrate on taking
the fastest route around the track. Some drivers try to hit certain points on the
track — a route they’ve mapped out in their heads that they think will get them
around the track in the fastest time. If it works, they try to repeat the previous
lap by hitting the points again — either by picking out a spot on the wall in
one corner or choosing a line on the inside of the track in another corner —
anything that helps them repeat the same lap every time. Drivers aren’t veering
all over the place if they don’t hit their points, but they may not be running
the fastest lap possible if they take different routes around the racetrack.
(See Chapter 9 for the lowdown on strategizing the driving of a race.)
97
Chapter 7: Who’s in the Driver’s Seat?
No time for timeouts
NASCAR racing, unlike baseball, football, or
basketball, doesn’t incorporate timeouts into the
competition. That’s one of the things that makes
stock-car racing so challenging. Drivers can’t get
out of their cars or take a bathroom break while
racing (drivers do get a bottle of water at each
pit stop, however). After drivers get in their cars,
they’re in there for the long run. That’s why you
may see drivers running to portable toilets before
the race. After that, they just have to hold it until
the race is over. Often, though, drivers sweat so
much during a race, they don’t need to go to the
bathroom because they’re so dehydrated.

Why Drivers Are Athletes
Some people think drivers aren’t athletes because many hide their muscles
under their uniforms and after a long race sometimes climb out of their cars
gasping for breath. Others think drivers aren’t athletes because stock-car
racing doesn’t involve a ball, a bat, or a hoop — all drivers do is sit in a car
and drive around, right? But if those people were to get into a race car on a
typical summer day and weave through traffic at 180 miles an hour, I’m sure
they’d change their minds.
While many drivers aren’t perfect physical specimens, they do have to stay in
a car where temperatures can exceed 120 degrees for more than three hours at
a time, concentrating on the road, their car, and the cars around them with-
out getting distracted. In order to do this successfully, a driver must have
lightning-fast reaction times, great coordination, and immense endurance and
concentration.
Reacting quickly
Imagine flying down the highway, going about 100 miles an hour, when the car
just ahead of you spins out and starts rocketing toward you. You’d probably
end up with at least a couple injuries and a damaged car. But most NASCAR
drivers have the ability to avoid getting into that wreck. It’s called fast reac-
tion time.
Drivers have incredibly quick reaction time. It’s the same ability pro baseball
players have to be able to smack balls out of the park, even when those balls
come hurling at them at more than 95 miles an hour. In tests over the years,
sports medicine doctors have reported drivers have the fastest hand-eye
reaction times second only to airline pilots. Not just anybody can get into a
race car and drive inches away from the guy ahead of him. Not just anybody
can avoid an accident that happens in a split-second just feet ahead of him.
But drivers can; that’s why they’re able to avoid wrecks every weekend and
sometimes make it home without a dent on their cars.
No clumsiness allowed
Driving a race car isn’t anything like driving your dad’s El Camino to the
food mart on the corner. Drivers need much more coordination to operate
their manual transmission, high-performance race cars. They have to shift
gears quickly, turn the wheel smoothly, step on the brake, and jam on the
98
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

accelerator — all while driving at breakneck speeds. Sometimes, drivers even
control the brake and clutch pedals with their left foot and depress the gas
pedal with their right foot, which is different than what you learned in your
high school driver’s education class. Of course in racing, people break those
rules all the time. In most cases, using the two-foot technique — which means
you’re a left-footed braker — is quicker than using the same foot on both the gas
and brake pedals. Professional race car drivers can’t be klutzes — otherwise,
they may find themselves careening headfirst into the car in front of them
when they accidentally press the gas instead of the brake.
Endurance is key
Even if you’re the best driver in the world, you won’t make it as a stock-car
driver if you don’t have endurance. Drivers may not be in the same shape as
long distance runners or cyclists in the Tour de France, but drivers’ bodies
can endure a lot — heat, mental strain, pressure to avoid an accident, and
accidents themselves. Drivers can also handle the intense pressure of compe-
tition, racing 42 other drivers who are among the best in the world. Without
endurance, we’d never make it through a race. Then again, we wouldn’t be
drivers in the first place.
Getting into peak condition
Many drivers work out on a consistent basis, and I think staying in shape is
imperative to being a successful race car driver. And as the sport becomes
more and more competitive, drivers have to be in better physical condition
to get an edge over everybody else — especially over the newcomers who
may have youth on their side.
99
Chapter 7: Who’s in the Driver’s Seat?
No time to pal around
It’s no secret that a lot of people consider me
the most focused driver around. And I take that
as a compliment, although sometimes people
can take my ultra-focused attitude the wrong
way, especially at the track. When I head for my
car just before practice or walk to pit road to
start the race, it’s not easy for me to smile the
whole way or stop and sign autographs every
two seconds because I’m already thinking
about the race and what I have to accomplish.
It’s not time for me to pal around with other dri-
vers or joke with fans. Just like any other ath-
lete, it’s my time to get in a zone.
S

As a racer, being in good physical shape helps in several ways:
 Drivers suffer fewer injuries. When drivers get into accidents, if they’re
in shape, they tend to walk away from scary-looking accidents because
their muscles protect their bones and internal organs. If a driver is
flabby, he has nothing protecting his insides. A driver who’s in good
shape also rebounds from an injury faster.
 If a driver is cardiovascularly fit or in shape aerobically, he has an easier
time sitting in a steaming-hot car for an afternoon while sweating off
pound after pound. The heat makes a driver’s pulse rise, so if a driver’s
heart isn’t in shape, making it through a race can be very taxing on his
heart.
 A strong upper body helps a driver wrestle the car around a racetrack
when it’s not handling well. A driver can’t just leisurely put one hand on
the wheel and expect to steer effectively. If his upper body is weak, he’ll
have a hard time steering.
Staying in great shape is one of my obsessions, even when I’m at the racetrack.
From Monday through Friday, even the Monday after a 500-mile race, I wake
up at 5:45 in the morning and get to the gym. When I’m at home, I don’t have
far to go because I have a gym set up in my airplane hangar, which is connected
to my house. When I’m at a race, I work out in a gym set up under a tent in
the motor home lot. Wherever I end up working out, my main objective is to
lift weights and keep my muscles strong for racing, something I’ve been doing
since the 1980s.

Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 
Need space and distractions? Don’t try racing!
If you’re the claustrophobic type, stock-car
racing isn’t for you. Drivers have to squeeze into
their tight-fitting seats and stay strapped in for
several hours. You can’t stretch, and you don’t
get much air flow. You contemplate the road
ahead, how your car is running, and ways to win
a race — and that’s pretty much it.
If you have a short attention span, driving a race
car isn’t for you, either. You won’t find a radio or
a CD player in a race car. You can’t hear much
besides the drone of the engine and you don’t
really see much — just the same scenery over
and over again. Drivers are used to that, though.
After years of training, they can focus on the
track for hours.

Drivers Are Hot Stuff
Even on cool days, the inside of a stock car gets extremely hot for drivers. Not
only does the engine run incredibly hot, but there’s also no air conditioning.
And on days when the outside temperature is in the 90s — like it is plenty of
times at places such as Daytona Beach, Talladega, or Darlington, the tempera-
ture inside the car can soar above 120 degrees.
Without air conditioning, drivers get pretty uncomfortable inside their race
cars (see Figure 7-1). Although drivers need to wear a suit to protect them from
possible fires, a helmet in case of an accident, and gloves to protect them from
heat and blisters while grabbing the steering wheel and throwing the stick
shift into gear, all that equipment makes the conditions even hotter. It’s not
uncommon for a driver to lose anywhere from 3 to 10 pounds after sweating
during a single race. The car’s main exhaust system used to travel through a
pipe directly under the driver’s seat only adding to the heat produced by the
car during a race. Occasionally, the seat would get so unbelievably hot that I
would feel it on my back and legs for days afterward. Now that the exhaust
system travels under the passenger side of the car, the heat is not as bad.
The floor of the car can get extremely hot. That’s why drivers wear special
driving shoes with a silvery, aluminum-foil looking cover around the heels and
on the soles. But sometimes, drivers need additional help to protect their feet,
so they strap extra pieces of insulation — called heat shields — onto their
heels when the floor is extra hot. Some of the older drivers have figured out
alternatives to protecting their feet, claiming the bottom part of a Styrofoam
cup works better than anything else to keep their feet cool.

A family tradition
Many families have been in the sport for 
generations — including the Frances, who started
NASCAR. Here are a few NASCAR racing fami-
lies involved in the sport:
The Pettys:
• Lee — Winner of the first Daytona 500 in 1959.
Won NASCAR Cup championships in 1954,
1958, and 1959.
• Richard (Lee’s son) — Holds the NASCAR
record for career victories (200) and is tied
with the late Dale Earnhardt for the most
NASCAR Cup championships (7).
• Kyle (Richard’s son) — Races in the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series.
• Adam (Kyle’s late son) — Raced in the
NASCAR Busch Series.
The Earnhardts:
• Ralph — Raced in NASCAR in the late 1950s
and early 1960s.
• Dale (Ralph’s son) — Shares the NASCAR
record for most NASCAR Cup titles (7) with
Richard Petty.
• Dale Jr. (Dale’s son) — Won two consecu-
tive NASCAR Busch Series championships,
including in 1998, his first full season in the
series. He advanced to NASCAR Cup Series
racing in 2000, was voted the series’ Most
Popular Driver in 2003, and won the Daytona
500 in 2004.
The Jarretts:
• Ned — Two-time NASCAR Cup champion
(1961 and 1965).
• Dale (Ned’s son) — Won the 1999 NASCAR
Cup title 
• Jason (Dale’s son) — Races in the Auto
Racing Club of America (ARCA) series.
The Labontes:
• Terry — Two-time NASCAR Cup Series
champion (1984 and 1996).
• Bobby (Terry’s younger brother) — The 2000
NASCAR Cup Series champion.
• Justin (Terry’s son) — A NASCAR Busch
Series competitor.
The Bodines:
• Geoffrey — The 1986 Daytona 500 winner
and part-time NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
competitor.
• Brett (Geoffrey’s brother) — Raced in the
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and NASCAR
Busch Series; he now works at NASCAR’s
Research and Development Center as
Director of Cost Research.
• Todd (Geoffrey’s youngest brother) — Races
in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and
NASCAR Busch Series.
The Wallaces:
• Rusty — The 1989 NASCAR Cup champion,
who is retiring in 2005.
• Mike — Races in the NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series.
• Kenny — Races in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series.
While plenty of family members have competed in
NASCAR over the years, nobody beats the Pettys
in longevity and racing lineage. Adam Petty was
the fourth generation of the family to race in
NASCAR — and no other pro sport can say that
they had a fourth-generation athlete in their ranks.

While drivers can’t turn on the air conditioner or roll down the window for a
shot of cold air, they’re not left to suffer without fresh air flow: all teams have
a cooling system inside the car that injects air into the driver’s helmet and up
through holes in the seat (see Figure 7-2). It’s a system of tubing that flows
from a box with a fan (and sometimes dry ice) in it — without this air flow,
drivers would have trouble staying conscious on hot days.
Ricky Rudd, a veteran racer who began his NASCAR Cup Series career in
1974, found out the hard way how important an in-car ventilation system
is on a hot day. His “air conditioner” malfunctioned during the fall race at
Martinsville Speedway in 1998. It was more than 90 degrees outside that day
and approached 150 degrees in the car, with no cool air blowing into his helmet
or up through his seat. Even so, he held on to win the race, but had to be
helped out of his car in Victory Lane. He fell to the ground, with blisters and
burns on his backside, and paramedics gave him oxygen so he wouldn’t pass
out. Even though he felt awful and could barely talk, Rudd still gave post-race
interviews while lying down. Later, he was given intravenous fluids because
he was so dehydrated.

Chapter 7: Who’s in the Driver’s Seat?

Racing All over the Nation
When drivers aren’t racing, they’re probably not lounging at home watching
a TV shopping network or pulling weeds in the yard. Their schedules are so
packed, they barely have enough time to sneeze after they get home from
a race before they have to take off for another event. In 2004, the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series had 36 points races (see Chapter 13 for a list of the tracks
that hold NASCAR races).
On top of the points races are two exhibition races every year that don’t
count toward the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup championship: 
 The Budweiser Shootout at Daytona International Speedway in
February, which includes the previous season’s pole winners and one
wildcard driver.
 The NASCAR NEXTEL Cup All-Star Challenge held in May at Lowe’s
Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, which features past win-
ners, the support-race victor, and a wildcard entry.
With 38 weekends of the year accounted for, drivers still have plenty of time
for themselves during their off weekends, right? Wrong. With test sessions,
sponsor commitments, commercial shoots, and series banquets, those addi-
tional weekends are spoken for.
The days of the week before the driver goes to a race are filled with things to
do, too. At most, a driver has one day at home to handle his personal business
before he’s off to a test or to an autograph session someplace far from home.
Here’s a snapshot of a typical week for a driver:
 Monday: If he’s lucky, a driver gets to sleep in on Monday after what’s usu-
ally a long day at the races. Most of the time, it’s the only day a driver can
spend with his family at home and take care of personal business. More
often than not, though, he has to go to a sponsor appearance and sign
autographs — many times hundreds and even thousands of miles away.
 Tuesday: Teams often conduct two-day testing sessions at racetracks
where the teams will race in a few weeks, with the sessions beginning on
Tuesday. (See Chapter 5 for more on testing.) For example, drivers and
teams test at Daytona International Speedway for several days in January,
but the Daytona 500 isn’t until mid-February. It’s just like preparing for
an exam. Teams experiment with their cars, trying different setups in
order to find just the right one for the upcoming qualifying session and
race. They talk about the fastest way to get around the track and discuss
what they’ll do when they return for the real thing.
104
Part II: What Makes It Stock Car Racing? 

During a test, the driver has to be at the track early in the morning, pre-
pared to slip into the driver’s seat and start the session. Even though
he’s not racing against 42 other drivers during the session, testing a
race car isn’t easy and may require running hundreds of laps. A session
usually lasts from dawn until dark, and teams use every minute of the
precious time.
 Wednesday: Frequently, Wednesday is the second day of a two-day test
session. But if a driver isn’t testing that day, he’s at an appearance for
one of his sponsors. Ideally, those appearances are held near a racetrack
(at a car dealership or an auto parts store) where the series is racing that
weekend.
 Thursday: This is usually a travel day for drivers because most racetracks
open for practice on Friday. Drivers fly to the town where a race is held
and then head for the racetrack where their motor homes are already pre-
pared for their arrival. (See the section “(Motor) home away from home”.)
Occasionally, drivers are already at the tracks on Thursday for pre-race
events.
 Friday: The NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series drivers qualify their cars for the
Sunday race on Fridays (see Chapter 8). They also participate in several
practice sessions during the day. After the garage closes, drivers often
meet with fans and sponsors at an appearance, making the drivers’ days
quite long. 
 Saturday: Drivers don’t get Saturday off. They’ve got to go to the track
and practice, making final changes on the car’s engine or its setup for
race day.
Happy Hour is the final hour of practice for the race, usually held the
afternoon before race day. During this time, drivers and teams make 
last-minute — and sometimes harried — changes on their cars. Because
of the urgency, Happy Hour is a crazed 60 minutes of cars whizzing in
and out of the garage after running laps on the track. Not all teams leave
the track happy after Happy Hour, however — especially the ones whose
cars ran slowly or whose drivers got into a late-practice accident.
 Sunday: Most races are held on Sunday (although a few are on Saturday
night). On race days, drivers have much more than just a race to drive in:
• Sponsors’ meeting: On race days, drivers get dressed in nice pants
and a shirt with their sponsor’s logo on it and then head for the
garage. Most of the time, they have a prescheduled appearance —
called hospitality — with a group of employees of one of their spon-
sors. Drivers give a talk and answer questions. It’s a little strange
for the driver to give a pep talk to fans only a few hours before the
race, but that’s all a part of racing and having a sponsor paying the
bills. You don’t see football players talking to people in the suites a
couple of hours before game time, but that’s the difference between
racing and football.
105
Chapter 7: Who’s in the Driver’s Seat?

Sometimes, thousands of employees from a sponsor’s company
show up at hospitality, where the sponsor sets up a tent and
serves breakfast or lunch. So as a driver, I have to be ready to
address all those people, even though I may be nervous about the
race or thinking about my race car. As soon as a driver finishes his
talk, he signs autographs for a while before heading back to the
garage for the drivers’ meeting.
• Drivers’ meeting: The most important thing on race days is to
make it to the drivers’ meeting, held two hours before each event.
(I discuss the meeting in detail in Chapter 5.) If a driver or his crew
chief misses the meeting, the driver must start the race in last posi-
tion, no matter where he qualified.
• Church service: Right after the drivers’ meeting, many drivers,
teams, and their families stay for a brief church service that’s held
race morning.
• Driver introductions: About a half hour before the race, drivers
assemble for driver introductions at a stage near the start/finish
line. At this time, awards may be given out for teams who did well
the week before or for the team that won the pole for that day’s
race. Each driver’s name is then announced as he walks across the
stage, waving to fans. Drivers sometimes ride in the back of a car
or truck, taking a lap around the track to wave at all the fans.
• The race: The main event; what drivers do all the other stuff for. 
If a driver is severely injured prior to the race, as Dale Earnhardt Jr.
was while competing in a sports-car race in the summer of 2004,
a substitute must be found. In Earnhardt’s case, the ride went to
Martin Truex, Jr., who drives for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. in NASCAR’s
Busch Series. Earnhardt didn’t lose any points because he managed
to drive at least one lap before turning the car over to Truex.
• Post-race: When a driver wins, he spends nearly an hour in Victory
Lane celebrating and taking pictures. Then he answers the questions
of the print media for another half-hour in the press box, followed
by TV interviews. Drivers who come in second or third also give
interviews with the press, explaining how their cars performed
and what they saw during the race. Even drivers who didn’t finish
well usually stick around to make a few quick comments. If a driver
crashed, he can expect to be bombarded with questions when he
emerges from the infield care center. (Every driver who crashes
has to make a mandatory trip to the infield care center for a check-
up before doing anything else.)
Throughout a race weekend, drivers must deal with reporters —
TV reporters wielding cameras and microphones; newspaper
reporters with pens, pads, and tape recorders; and radio reporters
with headsets and microphones. Whoever they are, the driver has
to talk to them at some point during the weekend — or at several

points: Before practice, after practice, during practice, before qual-
ifying, after qualifying, just after crashing during qualifying, after
winning the pole, after losing the race, or after winning the race.
• Getting home: Because the racing season is long and the schedule
is packed, almost most teams and most drivers have their own
planes. Some teams have as many as three, for those crew members
who have to stay after the race to re-pack equipment. Immediately
following the race, the driver (if he’s not in Victory Lane) heads for
a local airport and is in the air within the hour. The biggest prob-
lem is the traffic on the runway because nearly all the other teams
are trying to leave at the same time.
(Motor) home away from home
Drivers and their families spend at least three days and nights at each race.
Three nights multiplied by 36 (the number of NASCAR NEXTEL Cup points
races per season) is 108 nights away from home! In the past dozen years or
so, drivers, owners, and some crew chiefs got tired of spending all those
nights in a hotel room, so they began bringing motor homes to the races.
The kind of motor homes you find in the driver and owner motor home area
(called the motor home lot) at the races aren’t at all like a pop-up camper.
Many times, they’re quite luxurious with more amenities than the typical
home. Most of them have TVs (connected to satellite dishes), a bedroom, a
living room with leather couches, good-sized showers, glass cabinets, full-
sized refrigerators, kitchen tables, and music systems. This way, drivers and
their families are quite comfortable.
A motor home driver, who works for the race car driver, drives the vehicle
from track to track. After he gets to a certain track for a race weekend, the
motor home driver stocks it with food, extra uniforms, and other essentials
and then checks into a hotel.
Drivers don’t get fancy motor homes to show off. They just want to make
things as cozy as possible. The motor homes also make it possible for the 
drivers to bring their wives and children to the races — and have them at the
racetrack at all times. In the past, drivers were stuck at the track between
practice and qualifying with nowhere to go or hang out, while their families
were biding time in the hotel room or staying at home because they didn’t
think going to races was worth the trouble. Now, drivers have a private place
to go to be with their families at any point of the day and not have to deal
with traffic, crowds, or rowdy fans.
The motor home lot is a small, mobile village with all the same people travel-
ing from race to race. It’s also kept safe by security guards who protect the
entrances and monitor the grounds.

Chapter 7: Who’s in the Driver’s Seat?

Motor Racing Outreach
Because of the popularity of NASCAR racing, drivers usually can’t go casually
strolling through town looking for new restaurants, gyms to work out in, or
places to go to church because they’d be swarmed by fans. In order to help
out drivers and their families during all the weekends away from home, Motor
Racing Outreach (MRO) provides many services for drivers and their families
at the track. I don’t know what drivers would do without it.
The following are the services MRO provides:
 Church services are held every race morning, just after the drivers’
meeting. Drivers don’t have time to go to a regular church on race day,
especially with all the traffic headed toward the track, so the MRO inter-
denominational Christian church services give them a chance to keep
their faith alive. MRO also organizes prayer groups throughout the week-
end, held in the motor home lot.
 When the drivers are in the garage area, their kids aren’t stuck in the
motor home watching TV. MRO has a day care center in a motor home,
bought with funds donated by drivers and their wives and corporations,
where children read and learn — all under the care of MRO volunteers.
 For those racing team members and families who want to stay in shape,
there is a little workout center in the motor home lot that travels to every
race. It’s set up next to the MRO motor home and has a few treadmills,
stationary bikes, and free weights.

Meeting Richard Petty
To give you an idea of how easy it was — and still
is — to meet a driver, here’s how I met Richard
Petty, NASCAR’s King. Petty is NASCAR’s win-
ningest driver, with 200 victories and seven
NASCAR Cup championships. He was just hang-
ing out in his race shop when my dad and I went
to visit. I was a teen-ager then and, of course, my
jaw dropped when I saw him, but my dad was
bold enough to approach him and introduce us.
Richard Petty was the most gracious guy I’d
ever met and he talked to us for about ten min-
utes. Meeting Petty, who was, in my mind, the
ultimate human being next to my dad, was one
of the best things I’d ever experienced. There
he was, the most famous stock-car driver in the
world, just chatting with us about racing! To this
day, that’s one of the most memorable moments
of my life.

ASCAR races aren’t the simplest events to follow.
They’re not like football games where two teams
play for 60 minutes and are done. NASCAR events last sev-
eral days, beginning with qualifying for the race (usually
on Friday) and ending with a celebration in Victory Lane
on Sunday.
This part decodes every move that teams and drivers
make on the track and in the garage during a race week-
end, including race strategies and pit stops. I also explain
why a driver can bump into another competitor without
getting even a scratch.
If you want to know what’s going on during every moment
of race weekend — or even just race day — you’ll have fun
reading this part. Like a good mystery novel, you won’t be
able to put it down.

efore drivers hear the famous command, “Gentlemen, start your engines!”
they must qualify for the race. That means they’re not going anywhere
unless they prove they’re worthy to start — and to do that, they have to show
that their cars are fast enough. Regardless of how fast a car is, qualifying is
nerve-wracking.
Drivers have to qualify for a certain race by completing one (or in rare cases,
two) full-speed lap around the track without crashing or losing control of
their cars. Qualifying, which is normally held on the Friday before Sunday’s
race, sets the starting lineup and, if there are more cars attempting to qualify
than the 43 allowed for each race, weeds out the slowest. Just about every
week a few drivers fail to qualify, which is especially depressing for drivers
and teams who travel across the nation for a race, and then don’t even com-
pete in it. It’s like driving to California from the East Coast for a concert, only
to find that the concert is sold out.
The Importance of Qualifying Well
Qualifying isn’t easy. Drivers have to map out a specific route — or line —
around the track that he thinks will be the fastest, although that fast qualifying
lap is still like riding a runaway roller coaster that may derail at any second.
Teams also tinker with their cars to provide that extra burst of speed for
that one lap. While in a race, drivers must be patient and careful over 400 or

500 miles in order to make it to the finish line and win. If a driver also isn’t
patient and careful during qualifying, he will most likely be watching the race
from his living room sofa rather than competing in it. Driving one lap may
seem like an easy job, but lose your concentration and nick the wall just
once, and you may not qualify and instead be heading home.
Starting up front is groovy
A lot of work goes into making a car qualify well because, depending on the
track, starting up front could be the difference between winning and losing the
actual race. Tracks in NASCAR racing all race a little differently — especially
when it comes to letting a driver pass other cars (see Chapter 13 for more
on the different tracks). Some tracks are one-groove racetracks, which means
there’s only one comfortable way to get around a track fast without putting
a driver at risk of crashing. (A groove is a part of the track where the car’s
tires get the best grip, and if the car drifts out of that groove, it becomes less
stable and more difficult to control.) These one-groove racetracks, such as
New Hampshire International Speedway, make passing another car very diffi-
cult because when a driver pulls out of the groove to attempt a pass, his car
doesn’t handle well. And a car that doesn’t handle well doesn’t go very fast.
Other tracks have a high groove and a low groove, meaning cars can run side-
by-side or two-wide around the track, while some tracks let cars race easily
on just about any part of the track.
Qualifying well is especially important at one-groove racetracks because
passing is so difficult. So, if a driver starts fifth, he has a chance of making it
to the front. If he starts 25th, though, advancing is more difficult, unless the
cars ahead of him have problems, because getting out of the groove to pass
that many cars will slow him down too much.
Qualifying well is also important when racing on a smaller track, such as the
.526-mile Martinsville Speedway. Most short tracks physically just don’t have
enough room for cars to race two-wide, so passing is difficult. Starting up
front makes the day much less stressful.
Winning the pole
Drivers and crews scramble during the practice before qualifying to get the
car just right for the run, one they hope will be fast enough for them to win
the pole. The pole winner (or pole sitter) is the driver who runs the fastest lap
during qualifying, which means he starts the race in the front row and gets to
pick either the inside or outside starting position. (NASCAR races start with
112
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

only two cars in each row; so you have 21 two-driver rows and a single driver
starting from the rear of the field in the final “row.”) The pole winner starts
from the inside, or closest to the grass, giving him a slight edge as the field
enters the first turn. The second-fastest qualifier usually starts the race on
the outside of the front row, which is the outside pole. It’s an honor to win the
pole because you go to Victory Lane, take photos, and accept awards — and
your competition respects you a little more for it. They know how hard it is
to be the best qualifier, considering the fastest car (1st) and the slowest car
(43rd) are often separated by less than one second.
Winning the pole is a big deal because that driver is in the best position to lead
and win the race — even before the race starts. For at least a few moments,
that driver has the best view of the racetrack. He also wins at least $5,000 for
winning the pole, even if he gets passed right after the green flag drops.
Mapping Out a Track Attack
Most tracks are ovals, with two long strips of racetrack connected by sweep-
ing turns at both ends. People started labeling the turns so that drivers and
crew chiefs could talk about the race track — and have some landmarks to
help them figure out where the car is doing what and where to make to make
their moves — see Figure 8-1. Now they can say, “The car scraped the wall in
Turn two,” and everyone can immediately picture what happened. Drivers
compete on the track by circling it counter-clockwise. The section of racetrack
where the start/finish line is located is called the frontstretch, front straight, or
front straightaway. It’s where you see cars racing each other to the finish in
the last seconds of a race. The strip of racetrack on the opposite side of the
track is called the backstretch, back straight, or back straightaway. The turns
connect the two straightaways in the following way:
 Turn 1 is located at the end of the front straightaway and is the first turn
the racers make during a race.
 Turn 2 is at the beginning of the backstretch.
 Turn 3 is at the end of the backstretch.
 Turn 4 is at the beginning of the frontstretch.
On most NASCAR ovals, turns 1 and 2, as well as turns 3 and 4, are directly
connected, with no straightaway between them to make each turn its own
separate corner, like those at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Still, that
single, big, banked turn that you see at each end of most NASCAR ovals is
considered to be two different turns.
113
Chapter 8: First, They Gotta Qualify

Although most NASCAR tracks are ovals, they have several variations in
shape, as well a few oddball tracks. And drivers and teams have to adjust
to each in order to make sure they get the fastest qualifying time possible.
(For more information on the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series’ different tracks,
turn to Chapter 13.) Here are the different types of tracks:
 Standard ovals are the most common track shape in the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series.
 D-shaped ovals are modified ovals that have one long sweeping arc of a
turn for a frontstretch instead of a straightaway. (Even so, you’ll hear
many fans at these tracks refer to the frontstretch as the “frontstraight,”
even though it’s not straight at all.)
 Tri-ovals are modified ovals where the frontstretch consists of two sec-
tions of angled straightaways connected in the center by a slight corner.
 Quad ovals have two slight corners in the middle of the frontstretch.
 A triangle track, like the Pocono Raceway, is in its own category. It has
three straights, each of a different length, and three corners, each with a
different length and degree of banking.
 Road courses more or less resemble a winding country highway and
have a number of sharp, difficult turns.

Getting the Car Ready for the Run
Winning the pole isn’t the same as winning the race, but in NASCAR, every
aspect of racing is competitive. Drivers, crews, and team owners put a lot of
effort into running the fastest lap in qualifying.
Preparing the car for a qualifying run is hard work. First, the driver takes the
car on the track during practice to see how fast it is and how it handles. After
every practice session, NASCAR puts out a time sheet that ranks the cars from
fastest to slowest. Then the scrambling starts. If a driver’s car isn’t at the top
or near the top of the list, he has to change something so that his car can go
faster. Some of the things drivers and crews change or fine-tune during prac-
tice include the following:
 Balance: The most important thing to perfect during practice for qualify-
ing is the car’s balance. A driver doesn’t want one end of the car to stick
to the track or have more traction than the other end because an unbal-
anced car is a slow and hard to handle. Teams can adjust the balance by
inserting lead weights into the frame rails of the car. Then, depending on
how the driver says the car is driving, they can move these chunks of
lead within the frame rails to redistribute weight toward any of the four
corners of the cars in order to get the traction as even as possible.
 The engine: In order to have a fast qualifying lap, a car’s engine must run
perfectly. So while taking practice laps, a driver looks at his tachometer
(the gauge that measures how many revolutions an engine is making per
minute) in order to see how hard the engine is working. If the engine is
working too hard or not hard enough, a team changes the car’s gears to
maximize the engine’s output. Teams also must consider the weather
when deciding what gears to put in their cars. Usually, when it’s really
hot, a lower gear ratio is required, and vice versa.
115
Chapter 8: First, They Gotta Qualify
Qualifying butterflies
As the years have gone by, I’ve gotten more and
more nervous on qualifying day — literally to
the point where I’m on the verge of getting sick
to my stomach. I guess that’s because getting a
good spot in the starting field has become more
difficult as the sport grows. Every time I go out
to qualify, I have to drive close to the edge in
order to get the best possible starting position.
It’s a tremendously intense experience because
the expectations, especially my own, are so
high. Maybe that’s why I’ve always been known
as a pretty good qualifier. I’ve also gained con-
fidence from the fact I’ve never failed to qualify
for a NASCAR race.
S

Drivers listen to the engine to find out how it’s working. They know
exactly how it should sound when it’s working right. If it sounds funny —
too high-pitched or not smooth — they take the car right into the garage
and have the crew look at it.
 The shock and spring combination: In qualifying, particularly at super-
speedways where aerodynamics play such a crucial role, the closer the
car is to the ground, the faster it cuts through the air. Whenever air gets
beneath a car, it slows it down. So teams try to figure out the right shock
absorber and spring combination to get the car as close to the ground as
possible without letting it bottom out (getting too close to the ground).
(For more on aerodynamics, turn to Chapter 13. To find out about differ-
ent components of the suspension, flip to Chapter 4.)
 Taping off: When a team wants to see exactly how they’ll do in qualify-
ing, they prepare the car for an all-out run. Part of that preparation is
taping the car off. This means the team places heavy-duty tape over the
car’s grille (which is the screen at the front of the car leading to the radi-
ator), in order to keep air from going through the grille and slowing the
car down. A car runs fastest when air is flowing over it, instead of through
it or under it. That way, the car is sleeker and faster as it moves through
the air.
Even though taping off allows a car to go faster, teams can’t do this during
the actual race. With no air flowing into the radiator to cool the engine, a
taped-off car wouldn’t last very long in a 500-mile race. The engine would
just go kaput after a certain point when it became too hot.
Picking the Qualifying Order
Drivers don’t just drive randomly onto the track to make their qualifying laps.
The whole process is precisely orchestrated — it has to be. The qualifying
times of all the drivers are frequently separated by less than one second. So
if even one element is amiss, a driver’s qualifying time could easily put him at
the back of the pack.
To start the process, representatives from each NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
team gather to determine the qualifying order. Each representative (in order
of car owners’ points — see Chapter 12 for the lowdown on points) picks a ball
with a number on it out of a small rotating sphere — just like the ones used in
your local bingo parlor. But instead of yelling, “BINGO!,” the representative
116
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

returns to his driver and crew to announce when the driver will go out to qual-
ify. Why does everyone care so much about when their driver qualifies? It’s
not because they want to get done early so they can catch the evening news.
Sometimes, qualifying order can be crucial because weather plays a key 
role in how fast the cars run on the track. In hot weather the track is slippery,
so the car doesn’t stick very well, particularly going through turns. That
means the driver must slow down to keep from losing control. In normal
weather, the track is cooler and the tires adhere to the track better, so the
drivers can go fast through the turns without worrying about crashing. (In
cool weather, though, the tires may be cold, which results in little traction
and often in a crash. That’s why you see drivers swerving back and forth on
the racetrack before a race. They’re warming up their tires.)
In hot weather, the driver who picks the No. 1 qualifying spot and qualifies at
the usual mid-afternoon time, may run at the hottest — and slowest — time
of the day, while the driver who picks the last qualifying spot may be in luck,
especially if the sun goes down some by the time he qualifies, and the track
is faster. At times, though, choosing the first qualifying position isn’t bad.
For example, if a cloud just happens to float over the track at the right time,
cooling the track’s surface, a driver may get a fast lap. But if that cloud floats
quickly away, the next driver may be out of luck. That’s how delicate a situation
it is — the passing clouds can and do make the difference between winning
the pole or starting 20th.
Sometimes things go wrong right before a qualifying. The team unloads the
car off the truck, hits the track for practice, runs top speeds, and then as it
lines up for qualifying, something goes wrong. It can be as small as a lug nut
coming loose, or as major as having a transmission suddenly going south. So
instead of starting the race from the front, where he and his crew were fairly
sure they would, the driver now has 40-plus cars in front of him.
117
Chapter 8: First, They Gotta Qualify
The days before qualifying
In the old days, there were no limits on the
number of cars that started a race. For example,
75 cars started the first Southern 500 back in
1950. They crammed onto the 1.2-mile track,
running perilously close to one another. Today,
though, NASCAR is much more safety-oriented
and limits the number of cars that compete in a
race to 43.

The Moment of Truth: Racing 
the Qualifying Lap
Drivers take one or two qualifying laps, depending on which track they’re on.
They each get one lap of warm-up on the track before they take the green flag
at the start/finish line. At that point, the car, with a transmitter attached to its
fuel cell, runs over a sensor in the track to start the timed lap. During the lap,
drivers push the car as much as they dare, hoping the tires have enough trac-
tion and stick to the track — and hoping the car doesn’t spin out and crash.
It’s quite a relief when it’s all over and the car zooms over that sensor again
to end the lap. Sometimes we drivers joke about holding our breath during
the entire lap. Following a qualifying run, as well as at other times during the
weekend, cars have to go back through inspection. (For more information on
inspection procedures, see Chapter 5.)
After qualifying ends, cars are ranked by the speed recorded by NASCAR 
officials, who score all of the races and time all the qualifying laps with sophis-
ticated, high-tech equipment. The driver with the fastest lap starts the race
on the inside of the front row, or the pole position. If two cars log the exact
same qualifying time, the driver highest in the NASCAR points race starts
from the pole. A double-car lineup means the third-fastest car lines up behind
the pole sitter and the fourth-fastest behind the outside-pole winner, and so
on throughout the field. Only the fastest 38 teams are guaranteed a spot in
the race. The final five race entries are provisional entries, which I discuss in
the next section.
118
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Daytona is different
Instead of holding a single round of qualifying,
NASCAR does things differently for the Daytona
500, the sport’s season-opening event. The
Daytona 500 is considered NASCAR’s Super
Bowl. For that top race, drivers have several
rounds of qualifying — but not all of them are
held the usual way.
Unlike at other events, the contest for the pres-
tigious the Daytona 500 pole position is held a
week before the actual race. Drivers complete
two laps around the speedway, but only the
fastest two drivers lock in their Daytona 500
starting spots. Four days later, all drivers must
run in one of two qualifying races, called the
Gatorade Twin 125s (because they are each 125
miles long). Remember, even if the pole winner
and outside pole winner finish last in their Twin
125, they still “own” the first two starting spots
in the Daytona 500. At the end of the Gatorade
Twin qualifying races, 30 spots are now “set”
for the Daytona 500. The next eight positions for
the Daytona 500 go to those drivers who did not
qualify well enough through the Twin 125s, but
had the fastest times (among those not yet qual-
ified). The final five spots in the 43-car field are
given to teams that are entitled to provisional
entries, including past champions.
S

A Second Chance: Provisional Entries
NASCAR has a built-in safety valve for regular week-to-week drivers that have a
bad qualifying weekend. It’s called a provisional entry (often just provisionals) —
and it guarantees spots in a race for regular series competitors whose cars
weren’t one of the 38 fastest during qualifying. The provisional system guar-
antees that star drivers get into the race. So even if Jeff Gordon or Dale
Earnhardt Jr. has a poor qualifying run, fans still get to see them race because
they use provisional entries to make the field.
NASCAR allots five provisionals for each race, with those drivers starting 39th
through 43rd. A “champion’s” provisional spot, if needed, is reserved for the
43rd and final starting position. A champion’s provisional is reserved for past
champions who are still active drivers.
Provisional entries are allotted based on car owner points. (Owners receive
points for each race, based on the finishing positions of their cars in a partic-
ular race, no matter who’s driving.) Car owners in the top 45 positions of the
previous season’s owner championship standings each get four provisionals
at the outset of the season, and an additional one after attempting to qualify
for six events with a season maximum of ten provisionals. Car owners not
among the top 45, including new car owners, are ineligible for provisional
starting positions until after they make an attempt to qualify at four events.
After attempting to qualify for four events, the car owner gets two provisional
starting positions and additional ones can be earned after attempting to qual-
ify for six events with a season maximum of eight. Each provisional actually
used by a car owner during the season counts against the owner’s season
allotment.
119
Chapter 8: First, They Gotta Qualify
How the champion’s provisionals got started
Champions haven’t always had special provi-
sionals set aside for them. NASCAR instituted the
champion’s provisional in 1989 when the king of
the sport, Richard Petty, failed to make a NASCAR
Cup race at Richmond International Raceway. It
was a shocking day for fans, drivers, and crew
members to see NASCAR’s winningest driver
fail to make the cut. NASCAR officials devised a
system to prevent something like that from hap-
pening again, instituting champion’s provisionals
the next year so that drivers who had reached the
pinnacle of the sport could make every race, even
when they had poor qualifying days. Right away,
it was dubbed the “Petty Rule.” Champion’s pro-
visionals worked flawlessly for several years until
former champion Darrell Waltrip went home from
the UAW-GM Quality 500 in 1997 because former
champ Terry Labonte used the provisional
because he was higher in points than Waltrip.
In 1998 Waltrip ended up using 20 champion’s
provisionals in 33 races. It was supposed to be
an occasional fall-back for a past champion,
something used rarely and in an emergency. So
NASCAR changed the rule once again at the
beginning of 2004, this time stating each cham-
pion would be limited to ten provisional per year.
S

Note: Should qualifying be rained out, drivers line up on the grid according to
owner’s points in positions one through 38, with spots 39 through 43 lined up
on the grid according to owners’ provisional points.

I
n stock-car racing, there’s no such thing as drawing up a precise game
plan before a race starts — a set, pre-planned strategy gets you nowhere.
Racing changes by the minute — or even by the second — with caution flags
coming out because of accidents, blown tires, mechanical failures, and even
rain. It would be silly to devise a plan before a race when that plan may be
useless the minute something unexpected happens.
Strategy, however, is very still important as the race unfolds. For example,
when drivers take a pit stop near the end of the race, teams have to figure out
whether to change two tires or four, depending on whether they want to gain
track position (with a faster two-tire stop) or have the best tires (with a slower,
four-tire stop) in order to have the fastest possible car after the race resumes.
Or if a race has gone green for a long time near the end of the race (the race has
been under a green flag, without a caution flag coming out — see Chapter 5),
teams may tell their drivers to conserve fuel by easing off the gas. They do that
because they think their drivers may be able to avoid having to make another
pit stop before the race is over. Also, on superspeedways (see Chapter 13),
drivers have to know how to use the technique of drafting if they want to go
fast and win.
In this chapter, I discuss a variety of these and other racing strategies.

The Art of Passing
One of the most obvious strategies in NASCAR racing is to pass as many cars
as you can by coming up on either the right or left side of the car in front of
you (see Figure 9-1). But passing during a race isn’t like driving around a slow
car on the highway. Even if the driver is trying to pass someone on the straight,
wide part of the track, it may be difficult because the target doesn’t want
anyone to pass him. And that driver will do all he can to stay in front.
Depending on the track and 
conditions, the easiest pass 
may be on the left (inside) 
or the right (outside).

ing another

122
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Waiting for a passing chance
Making a pass is much more strenuous than it may seem, especially if the
car a driver is trying to pass is on the lead lap or if he’s battling for position.
Being on the lead lap means that a driver has completed the same number of
laps as the leader. (If the driver is a lap down, that means he has completed
one less lap than the leader.) Battling for position means the car that the
driver is trying to pass is on the same lap as the driver. For example, a driver
is battling for position with a car ahead of him when he’s in fourth place and
that car is in third.
The driver being passed is probably going to try to block, meaning he will try
to put his car exactly where he thinks another driver is going to try to pass
him. That requires plenty of concentration and plenty of glances into the
rear-view mirror, but when a driver knows how to throw a good block, even
the best cars can’t get by him. When a driver tries to pass another car, he has
to be patient and stay right on the bumper of the car in front.
Passes frequently occur in the turns, where cars tend to become difficult to
drive — and easy for other cars to pass — particularly if the car in front isn’t
set up correctly. If a driver can’t zoom by and easily pass, he has to wait for the
driver ahead to make a mistake, even a small one, in order to get by. This may
happen when the driver of the car in front takes a turn too wide (see Figure 9-2)
and slides up the track when coming out of a turn. Or it can happen when that
driver takes his car into a turn too quickly and loses control for a split-second.
Going through turns, especially while entering and exiting them, are good
places to make a move.
Bumping your way forward
At short tracks, passing isn’t as much of an art as it is a technique. Cars at
short tracks are going relatively slowly and there is plenty of downforce —
which means the cars stick to the track — so drivers can be very aggressive
without causing a big accident. In order to pass a car in front, the driver
doesn’t necessarily have to go below him or above him on the track. All he
has to do is give the car a tap — called a bump — on the rear bumper, as
Figure 9-3 shows. Most of the time that causes the car to float up the track
and give the other driver enough room to pass.

Chapter 9: Passing, Drafting, and Other Race Day Strategies

Passing the slowpokes
The driver in the lead wants to get as much space between him and the second-
place car as possible. This becomes a problem — and a big pain in the neck —
when the leader comes up on lapped traffic. Lapped traffic is a bunch cars
that have fallen off the lead lap either because they’re considerably slower

than the leaders or because they’ve had problems or penalties. So when the
leader is trucking around the speedway, the last thing he needs is a bunch
of slower cars getting in his way. This is when the blue with diagonal yellow
stripe flag comes into play, cautioning all cars not on the lead lap to look out
for those cars that are on the lead lap. (See Chapter 5 for more on flags.) It’s
sort of like driving in the fast lane on the highway and having to slow down
when there’s a slow car ahead of you that just won’t switch lanes. You could
pass on the right, but what if another slow car is in the right lane? You’re
stuck behind those cars until one or both of them decide to move out of the
way. Drivers have the same problem in racing. When the lead car gets caught
behind lapped traffic, the driver in second — who has no one ahead of him to
slow him down — has more time to catch up to the leader’s back bumper.

On the other hand, if the lead driver can pass the lapped car just before
going into a turn, the second-place car gets stuck behind the lapped car
(see Figure 9-4).

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Staying on the lead lap
Sometimes lapped cars aren’t that much slower than the lead cars. They may
have blown a tire, spun out, or been penalized for speeding on pit road or
doing something else illegal earlier in the race. Those drivers want to get
back on the lead lap so that they can have a chance to win. If they can get
back on the lead lap, these drivers have a chance at a good finish, especially
if a caution flag comes out. As much as they want to return to the front of the
field, however, drivers who are a lap or more down usually still follow a “gen-
tleman’s agreement,” allowing a driver in contention for the victory the right
of way.
Under a caution flag (see Chapter 5 for the lowdown on the different flags),
all the cars on the lead lap are bunched up single-file, almost bumper to
bumper, behind the pace car. Even if the lead car had a substantial edge over
the second-place car or the last car on the lead lap was looking at the leader
in his rear-view mirror and about to get lapped, everyone’s brought together
under the great equalizing caution flag. So if you’re on the lead lap, you always
have hope to get up near the front.
The problem is getting on the lead lap if you’re a lap or two down. Here are
some ways a driver can get back on the lead lap:
 Pass the leader under green-flag conditions. Sometimes a driver may
be a lap down only because his tire went flat or he ran out of gas — not
because he has a slow car. In that case, that driver may be fast enough
to pass the leaders and get back on the lead lap.
 Stay on the track when the leaders make a pit stop under the green
flag. And then hope that something causes a caution flag so that you can
pit when cars are moving around the track slowly. That gives you enough
time to make a pit stop and then catch up to the tail end of the field. If
you pit when everybody else does, it’s hard to gain position and you’ll
still be a lap down.
 Be designated the “Lucky Dog” driver. The Lucky Dog Rule provides that
each time there is a caution, the first driver in the one-lap down position
gets an automatic wave up to the end of the lead lap. The Lucky Dog Rule
is not in effect when there are only 10 laps remaining.
 Have teammates or friends on the track. Sometimes one driver lets
another driver get his laps back by letting the driver who is a lap down
pass the driver who’s on the lead lap. It all depends on how the lead-lap
driver feels about the other driver. If they’re friends, teammates, or if
they’ve worked well with each other in the past, the lead-lap driver may
let the other driver pass. If they’re not friends and have had previous on-
track problems, you can bet that the driver who’s down a lap isn’t going
to be able to pass. It’s like stopping to let someone into your lane on the
highway or on a road. You don’t know why you do it. It kind of depends
on what mood you’re in.
127
Chapter 9: Passing, Drafting, and Other Race Day Strategies

Listening to the Spotter
Unlike passenger cars, race cars don’t have side-view mirrors. So passing
another car when you’re going 180 mph and running inches away from the
car in front and behind you isn’t the easiest thing to do. That’s why teams
have spotters perched high above the racetrack.
A spotter is a team member who watches a race from atop the press box or
the grandstands where he can get a full view of the racetrack. His job is to be
the driver’s second set of eyes. As soon as the spotter sees there’s enough
room for a driver to pass another car, he tells the driver, “Clear high!” or
“Clear low!” which means, “There are no cars on the high side of the track
(the part closest to the grandstands)” or “There are no cars on the low side
of the track (the part closest to the infield).” A driver knows he’s clear to
move around the track in those areas and pass cars.
Although drivers use spotters at every race, spotters are absolutely indispens-
able at certain tracks in the series. At short tracks, for example, drivers are
lapping the track so fast, they can’t even tell where they are at times — and
they don’t have a lot of time to avoid accidents. So, at places like the half-mile
Bristol Motor Speedway, where it takes cars only about 15 seconds to go around
the track, spotters need to stay alert and notify their drivers of accidents as
soon as they happen. If the spotters aren’t quick enough, their driver may
become a part of the wreck, too. The same thing goes for superspeedways,
where cars run in excess of 180 mph just a few feet, or even inches, apart. For
example, if an accident happens at the top of the racetrack coming out of turn 4,
the spotter notifies the driver and tells him whether to go low or high on the
track to avoid it. (See Chapter 8 for an explanation of the turns on the track.)
At the bigger tracks, such as the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway, every
team has more than one spotter. One usually sits above the frontstretch and
one above the backstretch because one spotter can’t see the entire track, even
from a high vantage point. This is also true at Indianapolis and the Watkins
Glen road course. Sometimes a team may use several spotters, with each one
taking responsibility for a certain section of track.
From time to time, spotters communicate with people other than those on
their team. If a spotter is working with a driver who is leading the race and
coming up on a lapped car, he may walk over to the lapped car’s spotter and
tell him to ask that driver to move over. The spotter then relays the other
driver’s request, but that driver doesn’t necessarily have to move over if he
doesn’t want to. It all depends on the relationship between those two drivers.
If they’ve worked well together before, maybe the lapped car will give the
leader a break — possibly hoping the driver will remember the favor in the
future. At superspeedways, where cars go faster when they work together
than they do separately, a spotter may make a deal with another spotter to
get two drivers to work together and draft to the front (see the “There’s a
Draft in Here” section, later in this chapter, for more information on drafting).
128
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Using Your Driving Style 
to Get an Advantage
Not every driver is aggressive from the start of the race to the finish. Some
like to zoom to the front as soon as the green flag drops; others like to hang
behind the leaders. It all depends on the race they’re in, the racetrack they’re
on, and their race strategy.
Saving your engine
In a long race such as the Coca-Cola 600, drivers don’t like to push their cars
and engines too hard at the beginning. They know it’s wiser to conserve the car
for when they’ll need it most, which is the last 50 to 100 laps. If you push the
car too hard at the beginning of the race, you risk blowing an engine — which
means you won’t finish the race because your engine failed beyond immediate
repair. It’s amazing how often an engine blows during that last 100 miles of
the Coca-Cola 600 because the driver pushed it too hard throughout the race.
Sometimes the configuration of a particular track can wear on an engine. Blown
engines are common at the Pocono Raceway because the sharp turns of the
triangular track causes frequent and severe accelerating and braking, which
puts a lot of strain on an engine.
Taking care of your tires
One reason drivers don’t go full-bore around a track all the time is that they
must take care of their tires. No question — tires are sturdy: Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company creates tires for each racetrack and are working hard to
devise new tires that last longer during a race and don’t blister, pop, or go flat
easily.
However, tires aren’t indestructible. Drivers must be careful not to wear
out their tires too quickly during a race. This is called tire management. At
sandpaper-rough tracks such as Darlington Raceway, drivers make sure not
to push their cars too fast through the turns because the tires wear out more
quickly. Even on smoother tracks, tires don’t last very long, so drivers take it
easy when they can. Otherwise, the tires may wear out and provide less trac-
tion, which means the car will be more difficult to control. When tires wear
out or suddenly go flat, the driver can end up in the infield, up against the
speedway wall, or flying down the track.
Drivers also run the risk of blowing a tire if they wear them down too much —
and that may be dangerous if their car veers into a wall. Figure 9-5 shows what
can happens when a right-front tire blows: the car is carried to the outside
wall unless the driver can get the car under control.
129
Chapter 9: Passing, Drafting, and Other Race Day Strategies

Going easy on the brakes
Brakes can become a problem — a dangerous problem — at short tracks
because the turns are so tight that drivers have to brake hard to keep from
hitting the wall, especially if they enter the turn too hard. A small track also
means that drivers have to brake more frequently. That’s a lot of extra strain
on the brakes, which wears them down faster.
To compensate for tracks like Martinsville Speedway where races last 500 laps
around the .526-mile oval, mechanics put extra thick brake pads and extra
durable brake parts on their cars. And drivers make sure to conserve their
brakes when they can — especially early in a race when driving aggressively
usually doesn’t pay off.

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Bringing a spare
Every team brings more than one car to the racetrack, just in case the driver
crashes one of them irreparably. The best car for that track is the primary car,
which is the car a driver starts out driving during a race weekend. If something
happens to that car, however, a team must unload the backup car from the
truck. This is never a good sign for a team because the backup car isn’t their
first choice for their driver to use at that racetrack. It’s usually another car
out of the team’s fleet of about a dozen at the race shop, and a car used on
tracks similar to the one they’re at. But the backup car isn’t setup exactly like
the primary car. And if the driver crashes the backup car, too, he may be in
trouble at another racetrack — the track where the backup car was supposed
to be the primary car.
Gambling with Pit Stops
Pit stops play the greatest role in race strategy. When do you pit? When do
you stay on the track? When should you come in for a gas-and-go? When
should you make an air pressure adjustment in the tires — and which tires
should you change — in order to get the car handling better? It’s the crew
chief’s job to make those decisions, which puts a lot of pressure on him,
especially in the final laps when his driver is contending for the victory. A
good pit stop can get the driver out in front; a bad one can cost the driver
a victory (see Chapter 10 for a lot more on pit stops).
131
Chapter 9: Passing, Drafting, and Other Race Day Strategies
Not running on empty
Even though crew chiefs, engineers, and team
members figure out how many laps they can get
out of one tank before a race begins, sometimes
they make mistakes. In 1998, Dale Jarrett paid
dearly for that. Jarrett was leading the Brickyard
400, and his team thought he could make it just
beyond the halfway point before making a pit
stop. They wanted to lead the race at halfway in
order to pick up the $10,000 bonus. The gamble
wasn’t worth the $10,000, though, when Jarrett
ran out of gas on the backstretch of the huge,
2.5-mile track. Obviously, he lost his lead in a
hurry while coasting back to pit road — but his
car didn’t make it all the way to his pit stall. It
stopped just at the entrance to pit road, which
was quite an unfortunate place to come to a halt
because his pit stall was all the way at the other
end of pit road. His crew had to run down pit
road to the car so they could push it back to
their pit. They started out sprinting, but, because
it was a good half-mile to the car, the crew
came back huffing and puffing. Jarrett lost sev-
eral laps and finished 16th, loosing the $1 million
bonus he could have won for finishing first.

The most important result of a pit stop is track position (a car’s position in rela-
tion to the front of the pack). Teams can improve their cars’ track position if they
have a quicker pit stop than the teams who came into the pits ahead of them.
Tire gambles
Drivers can improve their track position by changing only two tires instead of
four during a pit stop. The few extra seconds gained gets them out on the track
while other drivers are still on pit road. But changing just two tires instead of
all four is a gamble. Although a two-tire stop is several seconds shorter than
a four-tire stop, a driver may not be as fast on the track as a driver who took
four tires. Older tires don’t provide as much traction — meaning the car doesn’t
stick to the track as well. The gamble is in estimating how much slower will the
car be. If you get out of the pit stop first after taking on two tires with 10 laps
left, and the driver who takes on four tires is 10th — perhaps those four new
tires will make him so fast that he’ll catch up to you before the race is over.
It’s a guessing game that depends on the track and how the team prepared
the car for the race. Many times, crew chiefs won’t commit to two or four
tires until the last second. They watch the other leading cars on pit road to
see how many tires they’re getting before making their own decision.
Another question that arises is whether to use sticker tires or scuffs. Sticker
tires are new tires that still have the manufacturer’s sticker on them. Scuffs
have been previously mounted on the car and “scuffed” on the track surface
during practice for a lap or two. Both affect the handling of a race car in dif-
ferent ways, depending on the weather and the temperature of the racetrack.
Crew chiefs are better able to predict how scuffed tires will perform, as they
already have practice miles on them, but sticker tires are usually more
dependable. The choice of which tires to mount depends largely on track
conditions and weather, as well as the crew chief. It’s all about strategy!
Tires affect a race car’s handling more than you may think. That’s why dri-
vers often state during a race (over the in-car radio) that they don’t like a
particular set of tires. For some reason, the tires don’t work well together,
perhaps because of a miniscule imbalance between them. This mismatched
set of tires may make the car more difficult to turn, or they may make the car
feel wiggly in the rear-end as it goes though the turns. The foremost thing on
a driver’s mind then is getting back into the pits for a new, hopefully better set.
Fuel and mileage gambles
Fuel mileage isn’t an issue in all races, only the ones where there aren’t many
caution flags. Long periods of green-flag racing mean that cars are on the track
until they need gas instead of staying on the track until there’s an accident,
which allows all drivers to make a pit stop while cars are slowed on the track
during the clean-up.
S
132
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Michigan International Speedway, which traditionally has long green-flag
runs, is a track where fuel mileage is often an issue. With fewer caution laps,
tanks quickly run dry. Drivers need to get as many laps from one tank of fuel
as they can, in order to utilize every last drop of gas in their tanks. If they
consistently get good mileage out of each tank of gas, they may not have to
make as many pit stops as the next driver — meaning they’ll have a better
chance at winning. Sometimes a driver may drive slower to conserve gas,
pushing the fuel mileage as far as it will go and hoping he can make it to the
finish without running out of gas. However, if a late-race caution flag goes up
because of an accident or debris on the track, all that fuel mileage calculation
goes out the window because all the cars come into the pits for more gas.
Teams figure out their fuel mileage before a race begins, determining how
many laps the car can make around the track before it runs out of gas. They
then decide on a pit window, which is when they’ll need to make a pit stop to
refuel. At some tracks, the pit window may be 55 to 60 laps, at others it may
be 70 to 125, depending on the length of the track.
Obviously, teams don’t want their cars to run out of gas — so they have a sys-
tem of keeping tabs on the situation. To calculate their fuel mileage, they weigh
the gas can when it’s full, and then again after a pit stop to find out how much
gas is left in the can and the catch can (which catches the overflow of gas) after
a pit stop. (Flip to Chapter 10 for more on pit stops.) The gas in the cans reveals
how much gas was dumped into the gas tank — which, in turn, reveals how long
the car can go without sputtering and stopping. While this sounds like an exact
science, it isn’t. For one reason or another, cars can run out of gas in the final
laps of a race, even when a team thinks it has enough gas to last much longer.
Tony Stewart was leading the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway in 1999, looking as if he was about to win for the first time in his
rookie year. What he didn’t expect — especially after dominating the race —
was his car to run out of gas with just two laps to go. Jeff Burton ended up
winning instead. It happens to the best of us, including me a few times. After
a while, though, you realize that you lose some races that way and you win
some that way. For example, Jeff Gordon was leading the 1999 NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup All-Star Challenge by nearly half a lap at Lowe’s Motor Speedway, but ran
out of gas with one lap to go. I was in second place at the time and couldn’t
have been happier to hear the news on my radio. The next thing I knew, I was
in Victory Lane celebrating a surprise win while Gordon was steaming over
the loss (and the lack of gas in his car).
If there’s a caution late in the race and a team thinks that once it’s lifted the
race will be under a green flag until the end, you may see a car dive onto pit
road just before the green flag is raised again. This is called a splash-and-go
stop — a pit stop in which the pit crew doesn’t change tires; instead, they just
fill the gas tank with a smidgen of fuel before the driver peels back out onto
the track. Teams do this when they think that without that small additional
amount of fuel, their car will run out of gas. It’s better to lose a lap or two than
to run out of gas on the track and lose several laps or possibly not finish.

Chapter 9: Passing, Drafting, and Other Race Day Strategies

There’s a Draft in Here
Have you ever been cruising right behind a semi-truck on the highway and
felt like the truck was pulling your forward? But then when you try to pass it,
your car bounces all around because of the air flowing off the front, back and
sides of the truck? This pull of the truck on your car is called drafting.
Drafting is a very important strategy on superspeedways and some of the
larger intermediate tracks that are so large and have turns so sweeping that
aerodynamics, or the way air flows over a car, greatly influences how well a car
does. (For more on aerodynamics and superspeedways, turn to Chapter 13.)
In racing, drafting is when drivers share airflow among them by racing in single
file. The first car in line punches an imaginary hole in the air and the cars
behind it slip more easily through that hole. Thus their engines don’t have
to work as hard to battle oncoming air. The car in front benefits, too. It gets
“pushed” by the cars behind it. Figure 9-6 demonstrates how drafting works.
The line of cars racing down the track in single file is known as the draft. The
first group of cars going single file is called the lead draft. If a driver loses the
draft and has to race by itself with no other cars around — or if he acciden-
tally falls out of the single-file line — he’s in big trouble because his car is so
much slower. That goes to show you that, at superspeedways, drivers need
help from other drivers in order to get around the track in the quickest way.
Dale Earnhardt was known as the master of superspeedways because, as
legend has it, he could “see” air flowing off the car ahead of him. It’s exactly
this sixth sense drivers need to make smart, thought-out moves on a super-
speedway in order to win.

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Making a pass at a superspeedway takes a special skill because of the drafting
aspect. It’s not like passing a car at short or intermediate tracks, where you
can roar past someone through a turn or tap the rear bumper of a car to try to
move it up the track. Try that at a superspeedway, and you’ll probably send
that car flying into the wall or spinning around and cause a major accident —
cars run too fast for that sort of trick. Instead, in order to pass someone, a
driver has to team up with one or more other drivers because two or more
cars go faster together than they do separately.
Suppose a driver dives to the inside of the track to pass the leader, and the
driver behind him follows. Both drivers most likely will draft past the leader
because they are pushing and pulling each other through the pass and proba-
bly leaving the leader with no one directly behind him to push him on.
The tricky part of this scenario is that a driver can never be sure whether
another driver is going to follow him when he makes a move. His spotter can
make all the deals he wants with another spotter (see the “Listening to the
Spotter” section, earlier in this chapter) in order to convince another driver to
team up with his driver to pass the leader. The problem is, these impromptu
deals are never guaranteed. The risk is that the driver dives out of the draft
to the inside and no one backs him up — this is called getting hung out to dry.
No car is ahead of him; no car is behind him. He has no draft. Now the entire
line of cars in the draft may pass him because he’s running much more slowly.
At superspeedways it’s not unusual to see a driver go from first to tenth if
he’s hung out to dry. It’s also not unusual to see drivers struggling to get
back in line after they’ve fallen out of line and lost the draft. Cars run so close
together, there isn’t much room to squeeze in, and most of the time, your
competitors show no mercy. Still, every driver tries desperately to get back
into line and back into the draft. If he falls too far back, though, he may lose
the lead draft altogether. In that case, he’s doomed unless he catches up to
the pack (which isn’t likely unless he has help from other cars) or a caution
flag comes out to bunch the cars back together.
A slingshot move is a special technique drivers use to pass cars on super-
speedways, but only experienced, savvy drivers have enough guts to try it and
enough talent to do it successfully. A driver has to utilize the air flowing off the
car ahead of him very carefully, allowing his car to get sucked in by that car
(see Figure 9-7). The driver then turns abruptly to one side or the other and
gets shot through the air right by the car he is trying to pass. The catch is, the
driver making the move has to know exactly where to position his car before
and as he makes the pass. For the move to work, he must use the air flowing
off the opposing car to his advantage. While the move doesn’t work as well
today as it did in the days before carburetor restrictor plates, which slow the
cars down, Dale Earnhardt, the superspeedway guru, was known to pull it off
from time to time. (Turn to Chapter 13 for more on restrictor-plate racing.)

Accidents Happen
No matter how careful drivers are during a race, accidents happen. Sometimes
drivers lose control of their cars. Sometimes they blow a tire. Sometimes they
blow an engine, and the car behind them slips in the oil they dropped and
spins out. Sometimes two cars inadvertently touch coming out of a turn and

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

send each other reeling into incoming traffic. Sometimes a driver hits another
car’s back bumper and sends that car flying. You can never tell when it will
happen next. All you can do is hope you miss the mayhem.
When at all possible, the spotter alerts the driver to an accident and tells him
where to go on the track to avoid it. But sometimes if smoke is billowing into the
air, neither the spotter nor the driver can see anything. So the best technique
in that situation is for a driver to grit his teeth and hope to make it through
unscathed. While it’s not failsafe, there’s often nothing else a driver can do.
Sometimes, though, drivers can see an accident in the making and avoid it
before it happens. Maybe a car isn’t really stable as it comes out of the turns
and its back end is wobbling. Maybe a driver is taking too many chances by
cutting off cars and coming close to the wall. Or maybe one car is riding too
close to the back of another car and disturbs the airflow off the car in front.
Instead of the air flowing onto the lead car’s spoiler, it flows off the first car
and onto the second car’s front end. That leaves the lead car with little rear-end
downforce, meaning it doesn’t have much traction or control of its back-end.
This is called taking the air off another car’s spoiler and it often ends in the
lead car spinning out and getting into an accident — and sometimes taking
out other cars with it (see Figure 9-8).

T
he car that wins the race isn’t necessarily the fastest one on the track.
Many other factors go into making it to Victory Lane. One of the most
important components is efficient pit stops.
A bad pit stop can cost a driver valuable time on the track. Wasting even one
second during a pit stop can mean the difference between winning and losing,
especially when races are frequently won by just fractions of a second.
In this chapter, I run down all the elements of an effective pit stop.
What Is a Pit Stop?
You can’t drive several hundred miles without stopping for gas with the small
fuel tanks used in race cars. A pit stop is when a driver pulls off the racetrack
and into the pits so the members of his crew can service his car with gas,
change tires, make mechanical repairs or adjustments to improve a car’s per-
formance, especially after an accident. Several factors go into how often a car
comes in for a pit stop, including how quickly the tires wear down and what
kind of fuel mileage the car is getting.
While Goodyear, the company that manufactures all the tires for NASCAR’s
top series, builds racing tires that last a full tank of fuel, some tires — due to
track conditions or debris — develop problems before the tank is empty.
Sometimes, the tires wear down more quickly than the fuel dwindles, so the

teams have to make a pit stop before their gas tanks are empty. On the aver-
age, cars usually go about 100 miles per full tank of gas, which is 22 gallons.
That’s a little over four miles per gallon. Your typical economy car gets 30 miles
per gallon or more on the highway. A stock car’s gas mileage varies from track
to track and also depends on the driver’s driving style. If a driver is rough
and pumps the gas pedal frequently, he gets worse gas mileage than a driver
who is smooth and steady with the gas pedal.
Pulling off on pit road
When a car needs to make a pit stop, the driver pulls off on pit road, which
is a separate road inside the racetrack that usually runs parallel to a track’s
frontstretch between the final turn and the first turn. Only one short track,
the half-mile Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, has two pit roads; the
43 cars are too many to stop on a 650-feet front row. (Check out a typical pit
road in Figure 10-1.)

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Pit road is a haven, like the shoulder on a highway, where drivers go get away
from the most hectic action on the track to have their car serviced. But that
doesn’t mean things don’t get busy on pit road. Along pit road, pit stalls of
equal size are marked off with yellow lines for each of the 43 cars in the race.
The drivers have to pull into the box completely to avoid receiving a penalty
(see the later section “The Rules of Pit Road” for more on pit stop penalties).
Some tracks have smaller pit stalls than others, depending on the size of the
racetrack itself, so pulling in and out of a pit stall can be difficult business. It
also can be dangerous for the crewmen who service the cars, as they can be
bumped by a car pitting in front or behind them or hit by a flying tire or part.
Each driver/crew chief combination has their favorite pit stall at each track.
Jimmie Johnson and crew chief Chad Knaus, for example, prefer the pit stall
closest to the exit of pit road. Other teams would rather have the first pit stall
upon entering pit road. With most pit road speeds between 35 and 55 miles
per hour, some teams would rather drive slowly the length of pit road and
exit quickly, while others prefer to stop in the first stall in an effort to avoid
colliding with other cars heading down pit road. Pit stalls are allotted accord-
ing to how well a team qualifies. The pole sitter gets first choice. 
The pit wall separates the pit stalls from the area behind the wall where teams
keep their equipment and watch the race. Usually, the crew chief sits on top of
a box called a crash cart, which is filled with equipment used for quick repairs.
The rest of the team hangs out in the area, monitoring lap times or listening
to their two-way radios in order to hear their driver talk about the car and
the race. When their car come in for a pit stop, the pit crew quickly jumps
over the wall to service it.
141
Chapter 10: Making Pit Stops
The backstretch blues
Bristol Motor Speedway has two pit roads —
one on the frontstretch and one on the back-
stretch. The double pit roads put teams pitting
on the backstretch at a big disadvantage. Those
teams are the ones that qualified at the back of
the pack, and the ones who lose several posi-
tions every time teams make pit stops during a
caution period.
Teams pitting on the backstretch can’t dive onto
pit road when everybody on the frontstretch
does under a caution flag. They have to follow
the pace car all the way to the other side of the
racetrack before heading down their pit road.
It’s an agonizing wait because by the time they
get there, the cars on the frontstretch may already
be done with their pit stops and are headed
back to the racetrack. Cars on the backstretch
often lose positions on the track, even when
they have fast pit stops. It’s very difficult to win
the race if you’ve got a backstretch pit at Bristol,
but it’s not impossible, as Elliott Sadler proved
in 2001, winning from the 38th starting spot. It
was his first victory, too! 

Makin’ a quick pit stop
Besides filling the car with gas and changing the tires, members of a pit crew
are quickly performing the following tasks (see Figure 10-2):
 Repair the body of a car after an accident, as long as it didn’t sustain
major damage.
 Fix a broken component on the car if it doesn’t require a major overhaul.
 Clean the grille.
 Remove a tear-off from the front windshield to improve the driver’s view.
This procedure has replaced washing the window with a squeegee.
 Make adjustments on the car to improve the handling.
 Give the driver a bottle of water.
If a driver says his car is handling terribly, the pit crew makes adjustments to
the car during a pit stop. Usually you see the rear tire carrier insert a long
ratchet, which is similar to a wrench, into a hole on the roof of the car to the
front of the rear tires. He cranks the ratchet one way or the other to change
the pressure on one of the rear springs in order to improve the handling (this
is called putting in or taking out rounds of wedge). A team also can change a
car’s handling by adjusting the air pressure in the tires, raising or lowering
the sway bar, or raising or lowering the track bar (see Chapter 4 for descrip-
tions of these parts of a car).

Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

A pit crew accomplishes many tasks in a short time. A good pit stop can take
as little as 14 seconds — not much time, considering the crew changes four
tires and fills the gas tank with two 11-gallon cans. If there’s the smallest of
problems, say the tire changer fumbles the air wrench, the stop may last 17
or 18 seconds, and the driver will undoubtedly lose a number of positions
because other drivers behind him completed their stops in 14 seconds and
got out ahead of him. There are several types of pit stops, including:
 A four-tire stop: The crew changes all four tires and fills the gas tank.
 A two-tire stop: The team changes just two tires, usually the two right-
side tires.
 A gas-and-go: The team adds gas to the car but doesn’t change any tires.
 A splash-and-go: The team adds just enough gas to make it to the end of
the race.
Going behind the wall
A driver also makes a pit stop whenever his team needs to repair his car after
an accident or mechanical problem. If the team has to make major repairs to
the car, including substantial repairs to the engine or suspension or to replace
major pieces of sheet metal or parts, NASCAR rules say the team must perform
those repairs behind the wall. Going behind the wall means leaving pit road and
going into a safe area in the infield or garage where the crew can work on the
car and repair it. Also, if the car is leaking fluids, a driver usually brings it
behind the wall so that the car doesn’t completely mess up pit road.
Pit Crews: Ballet without the Tutus
While the pit crew performing a pit stop looks smooth and choreographed, the
moves aren’t easy. Crews spend as much as one hour a day practicing pit stops
at their shop with a pit crew coach who times and videotapes their stops and
143
Chapter 10: Making Pit Stops
The camera’s watching
All pit crews film their stops and review the tape
as soon as their car rejoins the race so that they
can see what they did correctly and what they
did wrong. 
The films can be useful in another way, too.
Sometimes, when NASCAR fines a team for
something the pit crew thinks it didn’t do, the
team refers to the video of the pit stop to try to
prove their innocence.

analyzes everyone’s technique. Crews lift weights usually with the help of a
personal trainer at a gym set up in their race shop. Being in top physical
shape allows them to lift tires with ease and scramble around the car quickly.
Everybody knows that the faster the pit stop, the better chance the driver
has of moving toward the front — and to Victory Lane.
While an unlimited number of crew members are allowed to wait behind the
wall during a race, only seven can come over the pit wall to work on the car
during a pit stop. That’s why the crew members who service the car are often
called the over-the-wall crew. These teammates crouch atop the pit wall and
wait for their car to come down pit road. Even before the car comes to a stop,
the crew jump off the wall, carrying their equipment, and scramble around
the car to change tires, make adjustments, and fill the gas tank.
The seven crew members have specific jobs to do after they leap over the
wall (see Figure 10-3).
 Tire changers (2): The crew has one tire changer for the front tires and one
for the rear tires. They leap off the pit wall with air wrenches in their hands
and rush to the right side of the car (during a four-tire stop). They drop
to their knees (wearing knee pads) and remove the five lug nuts holding
the tire to the car. They take off the right tire and wheel, place a new tire
and wheel on the car, tighten the lug nuts (which are previously glued
onto the wheel), and then scurry to the left side to do the same thing.
 Tire carriers (2): Each tire carrier hands two 75-pound tires (already
mounted onto wheels) at one time to the tire changers and takes the
used tires away. When handing the fresh tire to the tire changer, the car-
rier is responsible for helping line up the tire onto the car, so that the
changer can tighten the lug nuts right away, without having to lift the
tire and wheel onto the axle. On the way to the left side, the tire carriers
roll the used tire to a crew member who is waiting at the pit wall to take
the tire away. Also, the front tire carrier sometimes cleans the grille as
he goes past the nose of the car.
 Jackman (1): The jackman usually is one of the strongest people on the
pit crew because he has to jump off the pit wall with a hydraulic jack
that weighs about 35 pounds in his arms— and then use it to hoist a
3,400-pound car off the ground. He first runs to the right side of the car,
positioning the jack under a specific spot (usually delineated by an arrow
or a line), and uses the jack to lift the car off the ground. The jackman
has to lift the car with one or two pumps of the handle, enough so that
the tires are off the ground — weaklings wouldn’t fare too well. After
raising the right side of the car, the jackman runs to the left side and
does the same thing. The driver gets the signal to leave the pits when
the jackman drops the jack and lowers the left side of the car and gives
the driver a thumbs-up.
144
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

 Gas man (1): The gas man doesn’t have to be nimble, but he does have to
be strong. He must step over the pit wall carrying a 90-pound, 11-gallon
can of gas and then fill the gas tank. When the first can empties, he usu-
ally gets a second can from the second gas man (who doesn’t go over
the wall) and fills the tank with that gas as well. Each can has a special
valve on it so that the gas shoots down into the gas tank quickly. You
can recognize the gas man easily because he usually wears a helmet and
a fireproof apron to protect him from fumes, spillage, and possible fires.
 Catch can man (1): The catch can man stands behind the car on the left
side and holds a special container to collect gas that overflows from the
gas tank. That keeps the gas from spilling onto the ground and possibly
catching fire as the car takes off.
Even though only seven crew members are allowed over the wall, other
people can help service the car — as long as they don’t step onto pit road.
Those team members use a long pole with a squeegee or cloth on the end to
wipe off any rubber or debris that has gathered on the car’s grille (to keep
the car from overheating if air isn’t getting through the grille and cooling its
engine). Another team member may use a pole with a handy basket on the
end to hand the driver a bottle of water. Until recent years, a crew member
also used to wash and squeegee the windshield with a long pole from behind
the pit wall. But stock-car windshields now come equipped with several layers
of a thin plastic film. Each layer is called a tear off because that’s what a crew
member does to give the driver a nice, new, clear windshield.

Chapter 10: Making Pit Stops

Pit Crews for Hire
Some over-the-wall pit crews are regular members of the team — mechanics,
crew chiefs, car chiefs, or truck drivers. Others are specially hired employees
who fly to the track on race day solely to pit the car. Some team owners don’t
want to risk using regular team members to pit the car because they may be
tired from working on the car all weekend or they just aren’t athletic enough.
Being a good pit crew member takes special skill, agility, and physical fitness,
which makes these guys hot commodities in the garage. They have to try out
and show their talents in order to get a job.
The following are some of the qualities that make a good candidate for a pit
crew member:
 Agility to maneuver around a car when six other pit crew members are
trying to do the same thing.
 Strength to carry heavy tires or to pump the jack handle and hoist the
car off the ground.
 Fast reaction time to get lug nuts off a wheel without hesitation.
 Ability to remain calm under pressure, even when winning a race is on
the line.
 Excellent hand-eye coordination, especially for the tire changers.
 The ability to remain focused when people are screaming and cars are
zooming by just inches away.
146
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
The importance of a good pit crew
Drivers never underestimate the power of a good,
fast pit crew. At least I never have. Suppose I’ve
been running second to Jeff Gordon all day long
and I’ve tried everything to pass him but can’t
do it. During previous pit stops, I’ve gone into
the pits in second place and come out in second
place. I’ve been about one second behind him
all day and just can’t catch him. In the next pit
stop, though, my crew bangs out the fastest pit
stop they’ve ever had, finishes before Gordon’s
crew, and I beat Gordon off pit road and take the
lead. Gaining a second on pit road is much
easier than gaining it on the track, especially in
the final laps of a race when a driver doesn’t
have much time to make up ground with his car.
That’s why a good pit crew is invaluable, and
that’s why, many times, they’re the first team
members that I mention when I climb out of my
car in Victory Lane.

The Rules of Pit Road
Just like everything else in racing, rules and more rules govern pit stops.
NASCAR officials, sitting above the track in the control tower, monitor cars as
they travel down pit road. Each team also has an official standing in their pit,
watching them as they perform the pit stop to make sure it’s all done legally.
If it’s not, the official penalizes them.
Slow down: Speeding penalties
While speeding on the racetrack goes with the territory, speeding on pit road
doesn’t. A driver can’t just drive like a maniac coming off the racetrack and
onto pit road. Although that’s what drivers used to do, NASCAR now has a rule
that limits the speed on pit road, to protect the crews working on the cars.
The speed limit on pit road ranges from 35 to 55 miles per hour, depending
on the size of the speedway. But drivers can’t look at their speedometers to
make sure they aren’t speeding because they don’t have them — instead they
have tachometers, which measure the number of revolutions per minute that
the engine is turning. During a pace lap, a pace car drives the pit road speed
while the drivers behind the pace car look at their tachometers to check how
many rpm (revolutions per minute) they’re turning. When a driver later crosses
the line that begins pit road during a race, he checks his tachometer to make
sure it reads the same as it did during the pace lap.
When a driver is caught speeding while coming down pit road under green-flag
conditions, NASCAR officials direct him to “pass through pit road” on his next
lap as a penalty. If NASCAR officials in the control tower catch him speeding
during a pit stop, he has to come down pit road again for a stop-and-go penalty,
which means that he has to come back to his pit box another time and stop
before heading back on the racetrack. If a driver speeds down pit road under a
caution, he has to start on the tail of the longest line on the restart. The worst
penalty is when NASCAR docks a driver a lap or two, meaning he has to stay
in the pits while other drivers continue to complete laps around the track. 
NASCAR generally checks for speeding on pit road with a stopwatch, checking
the amount of time it takes for a car to go from one predetermined spot on pit
road to another. NASCAR officials already know ahead of time that it will take,
for example, three seconds for a car going the speed limit to travel between
the two points. If a NASCAR official times a car and the stopwatch shows less
than three seconds, they know the car is speeding, and they throw the black
flag on that car.
147
Chapter 10: Making Pit Stops

Other pit road no-nos
NASCAR has a list of other no-nos regarding pit stops during a race. If drivers
disregard these, NASCAR penalizes them in some way:
 Drivers can’t pass other drivers when the field is under a caution flag
(see Chapter 5) or when they’re preparing to go onto pit road.
 When a driver pulls into his pit box, the car must be completely within
the box. A pit box is delineated by yellow lines.
 Only seven crew members are allowed over the pit wall at once. After a
pit crew member returns to the pit stall, no other pit crew member can
replace him in order to work on the car.
 Teams may use only two air guns per stop. The air guns remove lug nuts
from the wheel hub and tighten the lug nuts after a new tire and wheel
are mounted on the car. If one of the air guns malfunctions, the team
must complete the stop with the one working air gun. Teams must take
both air guns back over the pit wall after they change the tires and before
the car leaves the pit box.
 Teams may use only one jack per pit stop. If a car falls off the jack, how-
ever, team members can use a second jack to help raise the car back up.
 A catch can man has to be on pit road to catch fuel overflow whenever
gas is being added to the car.
 When a team changes tires, the tire changer has to tighten all the lug
nuts before the car leaves the pit.
 Teams can’t let their tires roll across pit road or into another team’s
pit box.
 Drivers can’t run over their air hoses or any other equipment when they
exit the pit box.
To Pit or Not to Pit
A driver’s crew chief stays in radio contact with him throughout the race and
tells him exactly when to make a pit stop. Teams always try to make a pit stop
under a caution flag, which comes out an average of three or four times during
a race after an accident, an oil spill, or debris accumulation on the track. If
drivers duck onto pit road under a caution flag — when traffic is slow on the
track behind the pace car — most of the time they don’t lose a lap. That’s
because crews can bang out a pit stop and get the driver down pit road and
onto the racetrack before the rest of the field passes him to put him a lap down.
148
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

Deciding when to make a pit stop under green-flag conditions is a little more
difficult. In some cases, a driver can get himself into all sorts of trouble by
pitting under a green flag because a driver loses valuable laps on the track
when he’s sitting in the pits while the other cars are whizzing by. Pitting
under a green flag is fine if everyone else pits with you because everyone is
losing the same number of laps. But when a caution flag comes out and a
driver is in the middle of or has just finished a pit stop, that driver has a big
problem. He already lost laps while pitting, but the caution flag gives other
drivers the opportunity to avoid pitting under green — meaning they won’t
lose any laps because the field isn’t driving top speed around the track.
Teams make it easy for drivers to find their pit box when they’re driving
down pit road by posting a big metal sign with the team name, logo, or car
number above the pit. One of the crew members also holds out a long pole
with a big metal sign attached to it. He waves the sign up and down so that
his driver can see it even through all the traffic. Sometimes, even with that
sign, a driver needs help because of all the cars and activity on pit road.
That’s when a crew chief calls the driver on the radio and coaches him to his
pit box, counting the seconds until he arrives at it. He says, “Five, four, three,
two, one!” as the driver pulls closer to the pit box, just to give the driver a
precise time reference of how close he is.

Keeping Racing Safe
In This Chapter
 Walking away from an accident 
 Understanding the safety features inside a stock car
 Seeing how uniforms protect the drivers
W
hile nose-to-tail racing is fascinating because it’s so competitive, it
also creates a risk of accidents. Lucky for drivers, though, the cars are
built for safety and to protect drivers. Safety standards in NASCAR racing
didn’t just pop out of nowhere. They’ve evolved and improved as the sport
has grown. In NASCAR’s infancy, the cars weren’t equipped as they are now
to ensure drivers were able to walk away from a wreck. Back then, drivers
raced regular cars like the ones your parents drove to work, so when they
collided, it sometimes wasn’t pretty. Those cars didn’t have the extra safety
features they do now — safety features that save lives and protect drivers. I
talk about these features in this chapter.
Stock Car Safety 101
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars are made to protect the drivers. Here are
some of the most basic safety features on a stock car:
 Stock cars have no glass, which would shatter upon impact. That means
no headlights, taillights, or side windows.
 The front and rear windshields are made of Lexan, a hard, shatterproof
plastic, as well as side windows when they are used.
 The doors can’t swing open during an accident because there aren’t
any. That’s why drivers squeeze through the window to get into the
driver’s seat.
 Tires have an inner liner so they don’t explode when they run over
something on the racetrack. The inner liner gives the drivers some time
to notice that a tire is going flat, perhaps giving them enough time to
make a pit stop for new tires.

Fastening Those Superior Seat Belts
Stock cars have added safety features that allow many drivers to walk away
from accidents. Seat belts are one of the most obvious additions.
When a driver slides into his car, he doesn’t have the luxury of one of those
automatic seat belts strapping him in for safety. It’s much more complicated
that that, but when you’re traveling at full speed with 42 other cars on the
track, it has to be.
Most drivers use five-point seat belts, which are five belts that come together at
the center of a driver’s chest, as Figure 11-1 shows. (Some drivers have a six-
point system.) In the five-point best system, each of the belts passes through
a steel guide that is welded onto the car’s frame. One belt goes over a driver’s
left shoulder, one goes over his right shoulder, another comes from the left side
of the seat, one comes from the right side of the seat, and still another comes
up between a driver’s legs. They’re all latched together at a single point at
mid-chest, where a quick-release buckle locks them into place. Although it
takes a little while to gather all the belts and buckle up, a driver can release
the seat belts in a fraction of a second when he lifts up on the latch that holds
all five belts in place. This is an important feature because drivers may need
to exit their cars quickly (see the “Putting out fires” sidebar for information
on how drivers handle fires).
152
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Rusty’s wild ride
While most drivers know first hand how safe
today’s cars are, Rusty Wallace has perhaps the
best story to tell after surviving one of the most
spectacular accidents in NASCAR history. In
1993, he was racing on the last lap at Talladega
Superspeedway when Dale Earnhardt smacked
into Rusty’s back bumper and sent him flying.
Literally. His car began spinning and was slid-
ing backwards when air got under his car and
lifted the rear end off the ground. That’s when
the roller-coaster ride began.
Wallace’s car tumbled down the frontstretch,
flipping eight or nine times before rolling to a stop
in the infield. Not much was left of his car — just
the steel frame and a mangled heap of sheet
metal and steaming engine parts spread across
the ground. “I just wanted it to stop,” Wallace
said. “I was thinking, man, this is going to be
real bad.”
Surprisingly, though, in a testament to how safe
NASCAR stock cars are, Wallace ended up with
only minor injuries. Examples like that keep
racers from worrying as they climb into their
race cars, knowing that drivers usually come
away with only minor injuries, or none at all.
S

Racing seat belts don’t work the way the ones in a passenger car do. The ones
in your regular car activate when the car jolts forward or stops abruptly. The
seat belts in a race car are working at all times. Drivers get into their seats,
lock their seat belts, and then give the belts an extra tug, making them as
snug as possible. In case of an accident, a driver wants to be strapped in
tightly because the less he moves around, the less likely he’ll be injured.
If you’re listening in on a radio scanner during a race, you may hear a crew
chief tell his driver to “give one more tug” on his seat belts during a race.
Why? No matter how cool it is outside, a driver’s seat belts become looser
and looser during a race because of the extreme heat inside the car. Drivers
can lose as much as five to ten pounds during a race as they perspire, so they
need to keep tightening their seat belts — during caution periods, not while
going full speed — in order for the seat belts to provide optimum protection.

Chapter 11: Keeping Racing Safe
Putting out fires
In the early years of NASCAR racing, fires were
a serious problem for drivers. To improve safety,
NASCAR officials mandated that all drivers use
rubber gas tanks — containers that were far less
likely to puncture, burst, or explode upon impact.
Now fire is rarely a problem in NASCAR — cars
are built with fire walls between the trunk where
the gas tank is located and the driver’s com-
partment, as well as between the driver and the
engine.
According to NASCAR rules, every car must
have a fire extinguisher installed within the
driver’s reach. NASCAR has also mandated that
the crewman who fuels the car wears fire-
resistant gear — a suit, gloves, shoes, and
helmet with face protection. (See Chapter 10 for
more on gassing up a car during a pit stop.)

Preventing Flailing Limbs 
with Window Nets
While seat belts keep a driver secured to the seat, they don’t keep a driver’s
head and arms inside a race car when the car tumbles. That’s exactly what
Richard Petty found out when his car flipped several times in May 1970 at
Darlington Raceway after slamming into the inside wall along the frontstretch.
When his car began to flip, Petty’s left arm and head came flopping out the
window as the car flew through the air. Petty survived the accident with only
a dislocated shoulder, but NASCAR officials made sure nobody else would
have to face the same threat by instituting the use of window nets, which are
screens made of a nylon mesh material and cover the driver’s side window
(refer to Figure 11-1). They help keep the driver’s arms and head in the car
during an accident.
Drivers hook the window nets to the top of the window openings with a pair
of latches similar to the one used in their seat belts. It’s a quick-release latch
that takes only a second to unhook. During a race, drivers unhook the window
net after an accident, which signals they aren’t hurt badly. In a multi-car acci-
dent, that signal helps safety workers determine which driver needs help first.
Window nets are used only on the driver’s side of the car. On the passenger
side, there sometimes is a clear, shatterproof plastic window that protects the
driver and provides for better aerodynamics — but only at tracks one and a
half miles or more in length. This window doesn’t roll down because it’s just
a shield that fits into and is secured in the window opening. On smaller tracks
and on road courses, however, cars don’t use the passenger-side window —
there’s just a big opening.
Holding Your Head Still: Helmets 
and Head Protectors
Helmets are the number one piece of protective gear that drivers can’t do with-
out. Drivers don’t just go to the local sporting goods store to buy their helmets,
however. They get them from special manufacturers who fit the helmet specifi-
cally to a driver’s head and put special padding inside the helmet to reduce
impact during an accident. After an accident, these manufacturers examine
the helmet and X-ray it to see whether there are any internal cracks. If there
are, the driver has to replace the helmet.
Starting in 2002, NASCAR became the world’s first major auto racing sanction-
ing body to mandate use of an approved head and neck restraints by all drivers
on every type of race circuit. These head and neck restraints, called the HANS
Device and the Hutchens Device, help reduce extreme head motion during
154
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

incidents and sudden stops. The HANS Device utilizes tethers that are
attached from the HANS collar to both sides of the driver’s helmet. In the
Hutchens Device, tethers are attached from the Hutchens body harness to
both sides of the driver’s helmet. Head protectors vary because each seat
is customized to fit a driver’s body.
Keeping Your Wheels on the Ground
After cars start spinning, they usually don’t become airborne — despite
being so aerodynamic. Cars have roof flaps on them designed to keep them
on the ground. Roof flaps are rectangular pieces of metal attached to the roof
of a car that are designed to lie flat when the car is moving forward, but pop
into the air when a car spins backwards or sideways (see Figure 11-2). Roof
flaps keep a car from lifting into the air. 
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars also have a roof hatch, which is like a trap-
door on the roof of the car. This hatch allows a driver to exit the car if his
window opening is blocked somehow.
Staying Safe inside the Roll Cage
Drivers can walk away from accidents because a protective cage surrounds
the driver, safeguarding him during impact. This roll cage of protective steel
tubing called roll bars keeps the driver from getting crushed if the car flips on
its roof or side (see Figure 11-3).
While regular passenger cars have a simple frame, the roll cage of a stock car
is very extensive. For example, the driver’s side door is reinforced with roll
bars installed to protect the driver from a driver’s side impact. Another bar
travels through the center of a car’s windshield, going from the top of the
Roof flaps

dashboard to the roof of the car. It keeps the roof from collapsing on a driver.
All the roll bars within a driver’s reach inside the car are wrapped in padding.
With protective bars and padding nearly overdone to ensure safety, drivers
can survive crashes at full speed, sometimes even without a scrape.
NASCAR officials make sure the roll bars that make up the roll cage are thick
enough to keep a driver safe. During a routine inspection, they climb inside the
car and use special instruments to determine the thickness of the steel. (Most
of the roll bars are in plain view inside the car.) They also examine the roll bars
to make sure teams haven’t drilled holes in them to make the car lighter in cer-
tain areas. Officials also make sure that roll bars are made of steel and not a
lighter, softer, or less-durable metal. (See Chapter 5 for more information about
inspections and ways teams try to get around the rules to gain an advantage.)
Racing Uniforms: Not Your 
Ordinary Sunday Outfit
Just like other professional athletes, NASCAR drivers have uniforms. But in
racing, those uniforms serve many more functions than simply identifying
who is who outside of the race car. The uniforms have a special, protective
use in case of a fire in the car.
Drivers wear a fire-resistant suit that’s similar to a jumpsuit (see Figure 11-4).
It covers their legs and their arms and zips up from their waist to their neck.
Under those suits, drivers wear fire-retardant long underwear. While these
suits make drivers hotter and more uncomfortable inside the car, the benefits
are worth it. In the rare instance of a fire, the uniform can be a lifesaver by
preventing burns.

In addition to their firesuits, drivers also wear special, space-age gloves and
boots that protect their hands and feet from the heat and possible fires inside
the car. While the boots are insulated to keep out heat, drivers often also wear
heat shields over their boots because the floorboards and pedals get so hot
that the heat’s unbearable without additional protection. Sometimes even those
heat shields don’t provide enough protection. Some of the more creative dri-
vers cut out the bottom of Styrofoam cups and stick them on their heels. But
other drivers try to tough it out. Dave Marcis for many years hopped into his
car wearing old-fashioned, wing-tip street shoes with no extra protection.
To give you an example of how hot the floorboards can get, Tony Stewart
forgot to put on his heat shields for one race in 1999 and ended up with burns
and blisters on his heels, which kept him out of commission for more than a
week. After a race in 1998, Johnny Benson gave his post-race interviews with
his feet stuck inside a bucket of ice water.

Winning It All: Making It to Victory
Lane and the Championship
In This Chapter
 Making the trip to Victory Lane
 Taking home the paycheck
 Understanding NASCAR’s point system
 Winning a championship
W
inning a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race is every stock-car driver’s
goal. Some never get there, but those talented enough and lucky
enough to win are certainly grateful when they finally reach the pinnacle
of the sport. In some cases it takes years; in others just a few seasons. No
matter how long it takes, the satisfaction of finally getting to Victory Lane
makes the wait worthwhile. This chapter shows you what’s involved in
making it to Victory Lane and also how drivers compete in the Chase for 
the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series Championship.
Making a Grand Entrance: 
Heading into Victory Lane
Victory Lane isn’t really a lane — it’s more like a circle or square in a fenced-
in area somewhere near pit road — but it’s where a driver goes to celebrate
after winning a race. After the winner crosses the finish line, he circles the
track one more time for a cool-down lap and then drives down pit road
toward Victory Lane. Before getting there, some drivers like to add some
panache to their win by doing doughnuts — spinning the car in circles — in
the infield or on the frontstretch. The car’s wheels spin out, burn rubber, and
send smoke into the air, leaving behind a bunch of tire marks and a bunch of
screaming fans.

Some drivers go even further than just doing doughnuts as part of their cele-
bration. The late Alan Kulwicki, the 1992 NASCAR Cup champion, who was of
Polish descent, used to drive the opposite way around the track to celebrate
a win. That way, his driver’s side window faced the crowd so they could see
him smile and pump his arm — and he could see the crowd cheer. It became
known as Kulwicki’s trademark “Polish Victory Lap” before he died in a plane
crash in April 1993. (See Chapter 16 for more on Kulwicki.) Several drivers
who admired Kulwicki continue to drive a “backward” victory lap in honor of
their friend.
Whatever unique celebration the driver thinks up, at some point he must
start driving toward Victory Lane. On his way there, other crews may wait on
pit road to give the winner a high-five, as they did in 1998 when Dale Earnhardt
finally won the Daytona 500 on his 20th try. The winner’s crew also usually
waits just outside of Victory Lane to guide the driver in and greet their hero.
Who’s in there?
Victory Lane is packed with all sorts of people. Of course, the winning 
team and the winning owner are in there, along with the driver’s family, TV
reporters, photographers, sponsor representatives, NASCAR media represen-
tatives, NASCAR officials, track officials, and track public relations people.
(See Figure 12-1.) Fans often pack the fencing outside of Victory Lane to take
pictures, but credentials, which allow you entrance into the garage area,
cannot be purchased.

Live network TV (and radio) coverage
Ever notice when you’re watching a race that you come back from a commer-
cial and see the driver getting out of his car just in time for cameras to catch
it on live TV? It’s not luck; it’s staged that way. A driver may drive into Victory
Lane and pull his car up to the awaiting crowd, but he can’t get out until the
network TV crew tells him to. Even if he is about to burst with excitement
over the win or is exhausted from the heat of the day, he has to sit in the car
and wait a few seconds until the commercial break is over. Then, and only
then, can the driver dramatically emerge from his car, climb on the roof, and
start spraying people with champagne or any other available liquid.
After that, the winner has time only to give his crew chief or owner a quick
handshake and his wife a quick peck on the cheek before he gets interviewed
on live TV. After TV is done, he gets interviewed on live radio, which most of
the time is broadcast throughout the grandstands. After TV and radio inter-
views are done, the photo session begins.
Photos and the hectic hat dance
A hoard of photographers wait somewhere inside Victory Lane to take pic-
tures of the winner, his crew, his family, and his sponsors. But it’s not just a
quick snap-and-go photo shoot as you may expect. A driver poses with the
following people each time he wins:
 His team
 His car owner
 His family
 His car owner’s family
 Each of his sponsors
 The event sponsors, such as Coca-Cola employees at the Coca-Cola 600
 Representatives from his car manufacturer
The photo shoot is especially complex because a driver has to do the hat
dance. He must put on and take off dozens of caps each with different spon-
sor logos on them. Each time the driver puts on a cap, the photographers snap
photos to send or sell to the sponsor. Those photos are one of the perks a
sponsor gets for being involved with the team and in the sport. While a driver
appreciates all the sponsors’ involvement, you can bet that it’s a challenge to
smile as big at the end of the hat dance as at the beginning. Still, even after
posing for his 45th picture, the driver doesn’t have too tough a time smiling.
After all, he’s just won a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race! And that’s not an
easy thing to do.

Chapter 12: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship

Newspaper and magazine reporters
The Victory Lane proceedings may last more than an hour, depending on the
race, but even then the driver isn’t free to go celebrate with his crew. Track
public relations representatives whisk the driver away to the press box where
he and his crew chief or car owner talk to newspaper and magazine reporters
for about a half hour. There’s always a question-and-answer session in front
of the group and often another session in which reporters get to ask the driver
questions in a small group.
Stopping by the suites
After that’s done, the afternoon or night still isn’t over. The winner goes to the
suites where employees from sponsoring companies await him. He answers a
few questions and then signs autographs. Champagne flows freely for every-
one there in order to celebrate the victory some more. At some tracks, the
driver also may go to the track owner’s suite or a NASCAR suite after winning.
The Growing Race Purse
NASCAR racing has become more and more lucrative over the years. Just
look at how much today’s drivers win each season. In the years that NASCAR
legend Richard Petty raced (from 1958 through 1992) he won 200 races, seven
NASCAR Cup championships, seven Daytona 500s, and $7,755,409 — making
him the most successful NASCAR driver in history. That means he averaged
about $221,580 per season in on-track winnings for 35 years. While other dri-
vers during the modern era (since 1972) have earned more money then Petty,
it is not likely that any driver will ever again win 200 races.
Today, however, even the non-winning drivers average much more than that
every year:
 From 1994 to 1998, Ward Burton won one race and averaged $866,820 per
season.
 In that same time, Ward’s brother, Jeff, won five races and averaged
$1,407,774 per season.
 In 1997 and 1998, David Green competed in 41 NASCAR Cup Series 
races — finishing only 30 of them and failing to record any top-ten 
finishes. Still, he averaged $476,852 each season.
 Jeff Gordon tops everyone. From 1993 through 2003 he won 64 races,
four NASCAR Cup championships, and $58,525,057. In 1998 alone, he
won $9,306,584 — more than Richard Petty won in a 35-year career.
162
Part III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 

When a driver wins a race, NASCAR publishes the amount they’ve won. That’s
the number you see in the newspaper the next day. But drivers don’t leave
the racetrack with all that cash stuffed into their driver’s suit. They have to
share the winnings. Depending on their contract with their team owner, dri-
vers get up to 50 percent of the money they win.
Winning a race can be very lucrative, but so can just starting a race. Michael
Waltrip won $1.4 million for his 2003 Daytona 500 triumph, while last-place
finisher Ryan Newman went home disappointed but $195,663 richer. Not all
races are as financially rewarding as the Daytona 500. A race purse, which is
the money the track pays to drivers who start the race, varies from event to
event and track to track. Some races, such as the Brickyard 400, pay the high-
est purses because they draw the largest crowds.
A breakdown of winnings
Ever wonder where all the prize money comes from when a driver wins a race?
Table 12-1 shows a breakdown of the purse that Jeff Gordon won when he
earned $1,637,625 at the 1998 Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
It was one of the highest payouts in auto racing history.

Understanding the Points System
After every event, points are given to drivers and their car owners, depend-
ing on where they finish in a race. The system used today was put into place
in 1975, so that drivers and teams could vie for a series championship.
The formula for doling out points was designed to reward teams and drivers
who support the series by racing in it on a consistent basis. At the time it was
designed in 1972, a significant number of NASCAR teams didn’t run the entire
series. The winner of a race gets 180 points, and the last-place finisher receives
34 points. You can see how somebody can lose a lot of ground in the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series championship if he blows an engine and finishes last.
Earning points
Both car owners and driver earn points, but do so in slightly different ways. 
A driver accrues points (called driver points) for the races he competes in,
whatever car he drives. But a car owner accrues points — called car owner
points — whenever his car is in a race, no matter who’s driving it. This ensures
that teams reap benefits from running in a race and investing in the sport.
Driver points accumulate toward the championship, while owner points accu-
mulate to help teams obtain provisional qualifying entries (see Chapter 8 for
more on how provisional entries work).
This points system is the reason you sometimes see drivers with the flu,
broken bones, or other maladies slide into their cars on race day just to com-
plete one lap. They don’t do that because they love pain but because a driver
165
Chapter 12: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship

needs to complete one lap of a race in order to earn points. (NASCAR awards
points to the driver who starts the race.) After that lap (or after he can’t take
the pain anymore), he pulls onto pit road where a relief driver replaces him.
The relief driver may be a driver who had mechanical problems with his car
and retired from the race early. Or he may be a NASCAR Busch Series driver
who just happens to be at the race that day. Regardless of the relief driver’s
experience, he’s someone who gets in the car because the primary driver
isn’t healthy enough to finish the race. The relief driver may hop in the car
for free or may charge a one-day fee for his services, depending on how well
the driver and team owner know the relief driver and whether that relief
driver is willing to do the team a favor. Whatever it costs, the injured driver
or the team owner is happy to pay. If that relief driver finishes well, the injured
driver ends up with the championship points because he started the race. And
the car owner accumulated those points, too, no matter who drives his car.
Breaking down the point earnings
Here is a breakdown of each finishing position and how many points the
driver and car owner earn for that race:
 1st place — 180 points
 2nd place — 170 points
 3rd place — 165 points
 4th place — 160 points
 5th place — 155 points

 40th place — 43 points
 41st place — 40 points
 42nd place — 37 points
 43rd place — 34 points
Racking up bonus points
In addition to the regular points that drivers and teams get for competing in a
race, they also can earn bonus points in a couple of different ways:
 Any driver who leads a lap gets five extra points. That means he must
be in front of the field when crossing the start/finish line. So, a race
winner gets a minimum of 180 points for winning a race because, at the
very least, he led the final lap. Sometimes a driver stays out when the rest
of the field makes a pit stop just so he can lead one lap and pick up those
167
Chapter 12: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship

five extra points. A driver may do this when he’s scrounging for points
because he is in the chase for the championship or because he is fighting
to get in the top 25 in the standings so that his team can get unlimited
provisionals (see Chapter 8 for info on provisionals for qualifying).
 The driver who leads the most laps gets five bonus points. A race
winner potentially can earn 190 points for winning — 180 for the victory,
five for leading a lap, and five more for leading the most laps. Sometimes
it doesn’t work that way, and a race winner leads only one lap — the last.
Winning the NASCAR NEXTEL 
Cup Series Championship
Winning the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series championship — stock-car racing’s
version of the World Series, the Stanley Cup, or an Olympic gold medal —
isn’t necessarily about winning the most races, although that certainly helps.
It’s about winning the most points during a season.
Beginning in 2004, NASCAR introduced the Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series championship, a completely new system for crowning a cham-
pion. Following the fall race at Richmond International Raceway, only the 
top 10 drivers in the point standings — or any driver within 400 points of the
leader — are eligible to contend for the series title. With 10 races remaining,
starting at New Hampshire International Speedway, the points leader starts
over with 5,050 points; the other contending drivers start over with totals 
in decreasing five-point increments according to their rank. The revamped
points among the top-10 drivers not only closes the points race, but means 
a driver who has an accident or technical failure can quickly be eliminated
from the title race, although they are guaranteed finishing 10th or better.
The race for the championship is hectic, nerve-wracking business. In 1997,
the championship came down to the last race of the season, the NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. Before the race began, nobody knew who would be
the champion — Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, or me. Gordon had to finish 18th 
or better to win the title, otherwise Dale or I would have had a chance. As it
turned out — unfortunately for me — Gordon finished 17th in the race and
won his second title. Jarrett finished second in the championship, just 14
points behind Gordon. I finished third in the championship, just 29 points 
out of first.
A driver doesn’t always clinch the championship at the final race of the
season, however. If his lead is big enough, he can clinch the title with two or
three races to go. That means he’s gained enough points that the driver in
second place has no mathematical chance at catching him. The first-place
driver could finish last in the remaining races — and sometimes not even
start those races — and he still would walk away the champion.

What it means to be the best
In 2003, NASCAR Cup champion Matt Kenseth earned $9,422,764; by compari-
son 1998 champion Jeff Gordon took home a championship check made out
for about $2 million. But although that mega money prize may be the most
obvious perk of winning the championship, there are many others:
 Media exposure: After winning the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series champi-
onship, the driver goes on a whirlwind media tour. Reporters interview
him, and photographers take thousands of photos. He traditionally is
invited to visit Late Night with David Letterman and Live! With Regis &
Kelly. It’s a thrill from the moment he wins until the end of the next
season when his reign ends (unless he wins the title again). A driver’s
sponsors are ecstatic about the media blitz, which gives them even
more exposure than usual.
 Prestige: Winning the championship means that you’re the best stock-
car driver on the best team that year. And no matter how your career
unfolds after you win NASCAR’s top honor, you’ll always be known as 
a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup champion. Fans and other drivers never forget 
it — and the record books don’t erase it.
 Respect: When you win a championship, other drivers and teams look at
you differently. It doesn’t matter whether they like you as a person; they
respect you for your accomplishment. They know how good a team must
be throughout the season — not just part of a season — to win the title.
Drivers can’t just win a majority of the races and expect to win the cham-
pionship. They have to record good finishes week after week and finish
every race — or nearly every race. If a driver wins half the races in a year,
but gets into accidents and fails to finish the other half — which are called
DNFs because a driver did not finish — he isn’t going to win the champi-
onship. Terry Labonte is a perfect example of the consistency required.
He had won only two races when he won the 1984 championship, and
then only won two races when he won the championship again in 1996,
proving race wins don’t win championships; consistency does.
 A great parking spot: The reigning champion gets to park his team
hauler in the No. 1 spot in the garage and also uses the best garage
stall at each track for the entire year. The rest of the teams line up their
haulers and use garage stalls according to where they rank in the points
championship.
But of all the perks a driver gets for winning the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
championship, the end-of-the-year banquet may be the most fun. Each year
during the first weekend in December, NASCAR holds an award banquet at
the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. That’s where NASCAR
pays tribute to the champion and his team. It’s also where NASCAR and
NEXTEL hand the drivers checks for their year-long performance, from the
champion’s $5 million to the $1 million awarded the driver who finishes 11th.

Chapter 12: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship

Numerous trophies are also awarded, including the one for the series cham-
pion and the rookie of year. The spouse of the champion traditionally also
receives nice gifts, including a replica of the winner’s ring.
In the week preceding the banquet, the champion is ferried around the city 
in a limousine. He goes to photo shoots, newspaper interviews, and live TV
programs. Broadway shows are a top draw, as are meals at New York’s finest
restaurants. He and his family stay in the most glamorous suite at the Waldorf,
which can cost more than $7,000 a night.
After the driver finishes his media tour of New York City, he dresses up and
heads for the banquet. It’s a black-tie function where everybody celebrates
the end of the season. Drivers, team owners, and crew members wear tuxe-
dos instead of their driving suits or uniforms (you’d be amazed at how they
clean up), and wives and girlfriends dress in sparkling gowns. While all dri-
vers are invited to the year-end ceremony, only those who finish in the top 
10 in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series points give speeches to the crowd packed
into the Grand Ballroom. That’s one big difference between finishing 10th and
11th in points; only the top-10 are called up on stage. 
Winning the Raybestos Rookie 
of the Year Award
The Raybestos Rookie of the Year Award is one of the honors given out at the
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series banquet. All the drivers running their first full
season on the circuit are eligible, unless they’ve run more than five races in
the series during another year. Some of the best drivers in NASCAR history
are former Rookies of the Year, including NASCAR Cup Series champions Dale
Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, and Rusty Wallace.
NASCAR and Raybestos award Rookie of the Year honors to the first-year
driver whose best 15 finishes are higher than any other first-year driver in a
complex scoring system that gives one point to every rookie who makes a
race, ten points to the highest finishing rookie, and nine points to the next
highest finishing rookie. Top-ten finishes are awarded extra points.
Rookies get bonus points three times a season, which NASCAR awards after
the 10th race, the 20th race, and the season’s last race. The highest rookie 
at those times gets ten bonus points, the next highest one gets nine bonus
points, and so on.
NASCAR also doles out discretionary points at the end of the year based on
how a driver conducts himself with the fans, the media, and his fellow com-
petitors. This way, NASCAR officials have the final word on which rookie wins
the award.

S
ome people think NASCAR drivers just drive in circles all the time. They
get into cars, go fast, and turn left — doing the same thing week after
week without any variance or scenery changes. That couldn’t be farther from
the truth.
The races are always different, even though drivers do go fast and turn left
most of the time. It’s hard to tell from the grandstands, but each track has its
own characteristics that make it challenging. One track may be high-banked in
the turns — which means the racing surface is steeply sloped — while another
track may be nearly flat. One may have a smooth surface, while another has
plenty of bumps. One may have a wide straightaway, which is the long section
of track between the turns, while another may have a narrow straightaway.
Not only does each track feel different to drive on, but each looks different,
too. You can find superspeedways (the longest of all NASCAR tracks), inter-
mediate tracks, short tracks, and road courses. All have different sizes and
shapes — and if a driver wants to be successful, he must be able to negotiate
every track with skill. Drivers have to be versatile and able to adapt quickly
to different tracks each week.
NASCAR’s wide range of racetracks does more than pose a challenge for the
drivers — it also gives fans variety. If watching the bump-and-pass moves on
a short track doesn’t thrill you, perhaps you’re drawn to the high speeds of a
superspeedway. Or maybe you find watching a racer’s agility on a road course
more thrilling. Whatever your taste, NASCAR has a track for you. Each track

174

also has a seat for you. Many racetracks seat more than 100,000 fans, not
including the infield, which is filled with fans perched atop motor homes 
and cars to get a glimpse of the action.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on all the different track types and the
styles of racing they produce. It also gives you a brief intro to each of the
NASCAR tracks.
Superspeedways Are Super Fast
If you’re looking for high-speed thrills, you’ll love superspeedways. Drivers
race in excess of 180 mph down the straightaways while just inches apart
from each other, and long conga lines of cars zoom past the start/finish line
in a blur of color.
In NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing, only two tracks are technically consid-
ered superspeedways. While the previous definition of a superspeedway was
any track one mile or more in length, that has changed now that NASCAR has
introduced bigger, faster, and higher-banked tracks into its series. Right now,
drivers and crew members consider only two tracks in NASCAR as super-
speedways: Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
They fall into that category because of their size (2.5 miles or more), because
they’re high-banked (at least 31 degrees), and because they require use of
carburetor restrictor plates.
This section shows you why carburetor restrictor plates are used and how
teams prepare for racing on the superspeedways.
Restrictor-plate racing
In the past, cars used to average speeds of more than 200 mph circling these
tracks, but in 1988, NASCAR officials decided to slow the cars down to make
races safer. The plates were introduced after Bill Elliott turned a qualifying
lap of 212 miles per hour in 1987. Knowing the crews would continue to find
more speed in newer engines, the plate was added at the fastest superspeed-
ways in the series. Despite the plates, the laps remain some of the fastest of
the year, as the frontstretch and backstretch are long enough for car to reach
maximum (although still restricted) speeds.
A carburetor restrictor plate is a metal plate with four holes drilled into it that
NASCAR officials place atop an engine’s carburetor (see Chapter 5 for a dia-
gram of the carburetor restrictor plate). The holes in the plate restrict the
amount of fuel and air that flows through the carburetor and into the intake

manifold, on its way to the combustion chamber. The fuel and air mixture
must squeeze through the four small holes before flowing more quickly
through the four larger holes in the carburetor.
In short, the plate chokes the flow of air into the engine, which reduces 
its horsepower. So, instead of cars roaring around the monster tracks with
about 750 horsepower, they have about 450. And less horsepower means 
less speed. Although fans noticed a difference in the type of racing at the
plate races (drivers weren’t able to pass as easily as previously), the plates
also benefited them physically, as incidents at non-supersonic speeds tend 
to keep debris from flying into the grandstands.
Although fans immediately felt the benefits of restrictor plate racing with the
increased safety of grandstand areas, the drivers had to learn a new kind of
racing for the superspeedway races: how to break out of packs caused by the
cars being set up so equally.
The restrictor plates choke an engine to the point where throttle response
is slower. So, instead of cars being able to accelerate away from each other,
they drive around the track in packs — sometimes one large, single pack. And
that leaves drivers feeling less in control of their cars. Drivers would much
rather drive at staggered speeds in order to pass one another. Also, without
the ability to zoom past a rival coming off a turn or into the backstretch, it’s
imperative for drivers and their crew chiefs to make “deals” by radio as the
race winds down. Two drivers drafting (see Chapter 9 for a discussion of
drafting) one behind the other can give the lead car the extra second needed
to win the race.
Unlike other tracks, where drivers decide when to accelerate and when to
brake, superspeedways make those decisions easy: drivers always have their
foot to the floor and rarely brake (unless they see an accident). This is called
running wide open. Drivers can do this at restrictor plate superspeedways
because the engines are choked down. If the engine didn’t have a restrictor
plate, the car would be running well over 200 miles an hour even through the
corners — and it would be nearly out of control.
Even though the restrictor plates cause cars to bunch in packs, many times
you see a group of cars breaking away from the main pack to form a lead
pack. However, if one of the drivers makes even the slightest mistake going
200 miles an hour with a train of ten cars behind him, he may inadvertently
cause an 11-car pileup in no time.
At those speeds, drivers sometimes are able to react quickly to avoid an acci-
dent just ahead of them. Sometimes they miss a wreck by just a few feet. But
most of the time, unfortunately, drivers can do nothing if a car just inches
ahead of them blows a tire and veers wildly out of control.

Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track

Aerodynamics: The sleeker the better
Race teams spend many long days working on their cars before arriving at
superspeedways. That’s because aerodynamics, or the airflow over the sur-
faces of a car, is crucial at those big, high-speed tracks. The long straightaways
and wide, sweeping turns provide a perfect arena for cars to go fast. Even
with restricted engines, the cars still exceed 180 mph on the straightaways.
That means they’re cutting through the air pretty fast.
Why is aerodynamics so important at superspeedways? At those tracks, a
driver never takes his foot off the gas pedal, so one of the only ways to get 
an advantage over the competition is to have a car that slips through the air
better. A sleeker car means a faster car. That’s why race teams are forever
refining and reworking the bodies of their cars in preparation for a super-
speedway race. While a winning car at a short track may have a banged up
side or a crumpled bumper, even the tiniest imperfections on a car costs 
precious speed on superspeedways — and can cost a win, too.
176
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
The thrill of superspeedways
I’m one of the few drivers in the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series garage who knows how 
it feels to drive a car on a superspeedway 
without a restricted engine. That’s a feeling a
driver never forgets. I drove in an Automobile
Racing Club of America (ARCA) race in 1981 
at Talladega and averaged more than 200 mph
per lap. We didn’t race in packs back then
because we didn’t use carburetor restrictor
plates and drivers had control over whether
they were going to run wide open or not. A
driver could go so fast that he needed to brake
in certain situations (or else, he crashed) — so
a driver and his skill were integral in performing
well in the event.
At that time, no one dared run an inch off some-
one else’s bumper because it was frightening.
The cars ran fast, and drivers knew they were
going fast. Now, though, it’s like driving down
the highway going 40 mph. Drivers aren’t afraid
of driving an inch behind the car ahead of them
because they don’t feel as if they’re going fast
at all. Drivers feel totally in control. But in a
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series car, that feeling is
deceiving. While we are driving slower, we’re
still going pretty darn fast. And if a driver
crashes, it still hurts.
S

Wind tunnels: Laboratories for race cars
In preparation for a superspeedway race, such as the Daytona 500 that kicks
off the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series season each February, teams take their
cars to a wind tunnel to figure out how well air is flowing over their car. A
wind tunnel is just what it sounds like: a tunnel that shoots wind at a car from
all different angles. Just like other kinds of scientific testing, it’s a slow and
tedious process to get all the data from the wind tunnel, but the information
is invaluable. Teams may make one change to the body of the car, and then
go to the wind tunnel and compare the results to the last time they went. If
the results are worse, then they know the change wasn’t a good one and that
they must go back a step and rethink their methods. During one day at a wind
tunnel, a team may change the car 20 times before coming up with an aerody-
namic shape that works for them. Any changes, of course, must remain within
the template measurements mandated by NASCAR.
The following are some of the measurements taken at a wind tunnel:
 Drag: When a car moves through the air, the air causes different kinds of
pressure on the surfaces of the vehicle. Drag is one of them. Drag also is
something race teams can’t stand because it slows the car down tremen-
dously. Basically, drag is a major drag.
Drag is caused by several things, including a high amount of air pressure
pushing on the front of the car and low air pressure pulling on the back
of the car. Other things cause drag, such as air flowing through the cool-
ing system, ducts in the body, and open windows. Air travels into these
openings instead of smoothly sliding over the car. Also, friction between
a car’s body and the air flowing over it causes drag.
177
Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
A physics lesson
Aerodynamics and superspeedways go hand in
hand. In fact, you can see a good example of the
effect of aerodynamics when you stick your
hand out of a car window. When you cup your
hand, you feel resistance from the air, and you
have trouble keeping your hand still. But when
you keep your hand flat like a knife or a wing,
the air flows over your hand more easily and
much of that pressure from the air is gone.
That’s the same way that race cars work. The
shape of the car is critical when designing for
improved aerodynamics. Teams want to make
their car as sleek as possible, so that it slips
through the air.

With less drag, a car can accelerate faster, especially at higher speeds,
because it needs less horsepower to move forward through the air.
 Downforce: While drag is bad, one type of air pressure is actually good
for a race car — and that’s downforce. Downforce is the air pressure that
pushes a car onto the track, giving it better traction at high speeds and
on turns. When the air pressure on the top of the body is greater than
the air pressure on the bottom of the body, you have downforce.
Even if a car isn’t engineered to have a lot of downforce, NASCAR 
allows cars to have front air dams and rear spoilers, which help create
downforce:
• A front air dam is a special extension that goes from the bottom of
the front bumper and extends nearly to the ground. (See Chapter 4
for an illustration and further explanation.) Most of the time, pas-
senger cars don’t have them, but race cars do in order to control
the amount of air flowing under the car and the amount of air pres-
sure pushing the front end to the ground. The air dam reduces
drag because air has less space to flow beneath the car; instead,
the air slides over the car. The air dam also increases downforce
because more air is flowing over the car, so more air is pushing
down on the car, giving it more traction.
• A rear spoiler is a blade that runs along the back of a car’s trunk lid.
(Turn to Chapter 4 to for an illustration and more explanation.)
When air flows over and along the sides of a car, it hits the rear
spoiler and gathers in front of it, increasing the pressure on the 
top of the body. At a superspeedway, the spoiler angle must be 
45 degrees, but at other tracks, each team determines the spoiler
angle (usually from 60 to 70 degrees) so their car reaches its opti-
mum speed. (That spoiler angle is one of the elements that teams
test for when spending time at a wind tunnel test. They move the
spoiler up and down, searching for the best combination of drag
and downforce at a specific kind of track. The trick is finding a 
way to increase downforce while minimizing the resulting increase
in drag.)
The trip to the wind tunnel is never a cozy one, and only a few team members
go along to conduct the tests. It’s a big deal that involves engineers from the
manufacturer, wind tunnel engineers, and team owners. In fact, from time to
time, NASCAR officials impound several NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars
after a race and take them to the wind tunnel themselves in their ongoing
efforts to keep the cars as equal as possible. They make sure to bring at least
one car from each manufacturer — which means at least one Chevy, one Ford,
and one Dodge. These NASCAR tests are different than the private tests teams
conduct in the wind tunnel. In private tests, the teams and the manufacturer
178
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

are the only ones to see the data — and they pay for that right, too. Wind
tunnel time is very expensive, costing about $16,000 for an eight-hour test.
In the group tests, though, NASCAR foots the bill and shares the data with all
three manufacturers, just to give them information on whether they’re ahead
or behind in the area of aerodynamics. It also helps NASCAR keep the three
cars in the same ballpark so they can maintain parity among the cars. If one
car has great aerodynamics and another one doesn’t, the sleeker car would
win technically all the superspeedway races — and that wouldn’t excite fans
very much.
Testing at the racetrack
With all the pressures and forces affecting the way a car drives, NASCAR dri-
vers and teams have to know a lot about physics. They use that knowledge
during wind tunnel tests and also at track tests where teams test different
body shapes and spoiler heights in order to find a car’s maximum speed and
best aerodynamic setup. At superspeedways, though, the tests are the most
nerve-wracking because aerodynamics plays such a crucial role there. Teams
gather information such as lap times, corner speeds, and suspension settings
to figure out how to make their cars faster. While the body has to be nearly
perfect for the car to cut through the air efficiently, the suspension package
must be nearly perfect, too, so that the car can hug the ground as much as
possible.
179
Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Rule changes make things equal
The heights of the spoiler and air dam don’t stay
the same throughout the year, necessarily.
NASCAR officials constantly monitor if one car
make has more downforce than another or if it
has an aerodynamic advantage over another
make. For instance, in 1998, NASCAR officials
decided the new Ford Taurus had too much
downforce because it was performing better on
intermediate tracks than other cars — it could
go faster on those tracks because it was stick-
ing to the racing surface better, which allowed
Taurus drivers to race through corners without
slowing down much, while other drivers had to
slow down in order to stay in control of their
vehicle. Because NASCAR is forever searching
to keep the three car makes as equal as possi-
ble (see Chapter 1), it changed the rules and
required a smaller spoiler on every Taurus. The
smaller spoiler gives the car less downforce
and less drag, which makes the car less stable
on the track, harder to drive, and slower, too.
S

Rough-and-Tumble Short Tracks
While cars have to be nearly impeccable to win a superspeedway race, the
opposite applies to short track races. They can, and they have, limped into
Victory Lane battered and banged up but still victorious.
Short tracks are less than one mile in length, where aerodynamics and horse-
power aren’t particularly important in winning the race. That’s because the
track is so short, there’s not much room to accelerate and get into open air,
so sometimes drivers are on the brake almost as much as they’re on the gas.
Also, with little room for cars to move around, short-track races are filled
with bumping and banging. Many times, you see the winning race car roll into
Victory Lane with a bunch of dents, scratches, and tire marks on it. Even
though the car may look pretty sad, it was still strong enough to survive a
short-track race — and surviving is the key to winning.
The following speedways are the short tracks in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series. They are the places where cars are bound to get a beating before the
race is over:
 Bristol Motor Speedway, a high-banked, .533-mile oval located in Bristol,
Tennessee.
 Martinsville Speedway, a nearly-flat, .526-mile oval located in Martinsville,
Virginia.
 Richmond International Raceway, a .5-mile, D-shaped track located 
in Richmond, Virginia.
Short tracks create short tempers
The shorter the track, the less room the cars have to maneuver. And less
room invites more contact among cars. So at short tracks, the etiquette
changes a bit. Instead of passing someone on the outside or inside, some 
drivers opt for the bump-and-pass move (see Chapter 9 on racing strategies).
They nudge the car ahead of them out of the way by bumping its rear bumper
to push it up the track. Sometimes cars get penalized and sometimes they
don’t. That’s the nature of short-track racing. It’s high-contact, high-temper,
and high-action crammed into one tiny track.
While short-track racing is a lot of fun, it has many accidents because cars
don’t have much room to move around and get all bunched up together. If
one car spins out or loses control, the cars behind it may end up getting col-
lected by the wreck because they have no where to go. Accidents happen
really quickly at short tracks because the speeds are so fast and the tracks
180
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

are so small. At Bristol, a car can circle the track in about 15 seconds. So
when an accident happens, the cars behind the wreck can become a part 
of it in a fraction of a second.
Qualifying is particularly important at short tracks because passing on tracks
so small is difficult. Even if a driver qualifies a decent 15th, he may be stuck
there if he can’t find a way around the cars ahead of him. Most race winners
at these tracks come from the top-ten qualifiers. Most drivers who don’t qual-
ify in the top ten are cranky.
Short tracks are NASCAR’s roots
Short tracks are special places in NASCAR history because racing started
there and many racers started their careers there. Way before NASCAR formed
in 1948, short tracks ruled the racing world. There was no such thing as a
superspeedway or even 1.5-mile tracks. (In fact, I don’t even think asphalt was
that popular back then.) Those bigger tracks were too expensive to build, so
track owners went with the plain and simple dirt track to get by — and those
were the only tracks around. Sure, people always raced on the hard-packed
sands of Daytona Beach, but in most parts of the nation, short tracks were all
that racers had. Drivers either raced on a short track or they didn’t race at
all. That’s how short tracks became so popular and how they provided a
strong foundation for stock-car racing in America.
181
Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Where stock-car drivers start out
Most NASCAR drivers started their careers 
driving on short tracks in the nation’s smaller
stock-car series, so short tracks are places
many of us call home. People just don’t grow up
learning how to drive on a 2.5-mile paved super-
speedway or a high-banked intermediate track.
There aren’t many around — and that’s proba-
bly a good thing because a driver needs to have
certain skills before he or she drives on those
tracks, anyway.
So, beginning racers learn how to drive on small
dirt tracks, where they hone their skills and
improve their reaction times, and then move up
to bigger tracks through the years. Still, that
doesn’t mean that short tracks are easier to
drive — in fact, in many cases, they’re more dif-
ficult. Just because a driver has a good, fast car
doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll be in Victory
Lane at the end of the race. Short tracks require
that drivers have keen driving skills to pass or
to stay in front, so they’re a great place to learn
the basics.
S

Intermediate Tracks Are 
Middle-of-the-Road
Not all racetracks in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing are superspeedways
or short tracks. There are plenty of tracks that fall into a category between
those two extremes, combining a diluted version of a superspeedway’s high
speeds with the rubbing-and-bumping kind of racing found on a short track.
These combination tracks, which are usually oval tracks at least one mile but
less than two miles long, are called intermediate tracks. (Keep in mind that
NASCAR technically considers tracks one mile or more in length as super-
speedways, but that technical definition isn’t what drivers and teams go by.)
The following are the intermediate tracks in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series:
 Atlanta Motor Speedway, a 1.54-mile oval in Hampton, Georgia, just 
outside of Atlanta.
 California Speedway, a 2-mile oval in Fontana, California, near Los
Angeles.
 Darlington Raceway, a 1.366-mile, egg-shaped oval in Darlington, South
Carolina.
 Dover International Speedway, a 1-mile oval in Dover, Delaware.
 Homestead-Miami Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Homestead, Florida, near
Miami.
 Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile oval in Indianapolis, Indiana.
 Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Las Vegas.
 Lowe’s Motor Speedway (formerly Charlotte Motor Speedway), a 
1.5-mile oval in Concord, North Carolina, just north of Charlotte.
 New Hampshire International Speedway, a 1.058-mile oval located in
Loudon, New Hampshire.
 Michigan International Speedway, a 2-mile oval in Brooklyn, Michigan,
just outside of Detroit.
 Phoenix International Raceway, a 1-mile oval located in Phoenix,
Arizona.
 Pocono Raceway, a 2.5-mile triangular track in Long Pond, Pennsylvania.
 Texas Motor Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval located in Fort Worth, Texas.
Even though NASCAR’s intermediate tracks are all comparable in size, that
doesn’t mean they host the same kind of races or are the same to drive on.
Each racetrack has its own characteristics, such as high banking (when the
racing surface is at an angle), bumpy racing surfaces, or difficult-to-negotiate
turns. That’s what makes each intermediate track unique. And that’s what
makes it challenging for drivers and interesting for fans.
182
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

The Dreaded Road Courses
It’s not much of an exaggeration to say most NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series 
drivers would rather call in sick than drive on a road course. Some drivers,
however, are very skilled at road courses, including Jeff Gordon and Robby
Gordon. For others, it’s just not what they’re used to. Road courses aren’t
shaped the way ovals are, with four turns and two straightaways. They’re
complex configurations of left and right turns of all sorts of angles. While
some may be sweeping, gradual turns, others may be hairpin turns — which
are drastic, sharply-angled turns that make drivers to slow down to a crawl.
(These turns are shaped like a hairpin where drivers go into the turn travel-
ing one direction and exit the turn going the opposite direction.) The whole
point of it is that there’s no consistency to the course — sometimes drivers
feel as though they’re driving through a great, big, hilly field; other times,
they think they’re racing through a maze.
Instead of holding the throttle wide open the whole way around the track as 
a driver does on a superspeedway, racing on a road course entails a lot of
shifts in speed — and a lot of shifting gears. Pocono Raceway, which isn’t a
road course, is the only other track in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series where
drivers shift gears during the race. They shift at least two times per lap
because of the sharp turns at the triangular track — but the road courses
require much more shifting than that because of the many turns and eleva-
tion changes during an event.
183
Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Road course skills
Racing on road courses is a specialized skill for
NASCAR drivers because they are so used to
racing on circular tracks. So it’s understandable
to see stock-car drivers freak out a bit when
they show up at a track with long straightaways,
short straightaways, wide turns, sharp turns,
dips, and slopes. It’s just not what most stock-
car drivers were trained to do. For me, though,
driving on a road course comes more easily
than for most stock-car drivers. In fact, it’s
almost second nature.
I learned how to drive a car — not a go-kart, but
a real car — when I was just 14. I drove my car
as fast as it would go, not only on paved road,
but also on the hilly, curvy dirt roads of
Arkansas. That’s where I fine-tuned my driving
skills, such as how to control a car going
through turns and how not to run into ditches
(which was important because there were
plenty of ditches around to run into).Those
lessons have helped me through the years on all
tracks, but particularly on road courses. I won

International from 1993 to 1995, so I can’t com-

NASCAR travels to only two road courses each year, with one race at each of
the tracks:
 Infineon Raceway, a 1.95-mile, 11-turn road course in Sonoma, California.
 Watkins Glen International, a 2.45-mile, 11-turn road course in Watkins
Glen, New York.
Racing under the Lights
While each NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series track has its own appeal, some of 
the tracks have a special allure: night racing. While cars race the same way,
the show they put on for fans is much different. When cars bottom out or
crash against each other, sparks shoot into the air like fireworks. It’s quite a
spectacle.
More and more tracks are installing lighting systems so that they can host
night races, or so that rain-delayed events can be held at night, if need be.
Currently, five speedways host night NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series events:
 Bristol Motor Speedway hosts night racing each summer at its second
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series event of the season.
 Daytona International Speedway has a night race every July.
 Lowe’s Motor Speedway hosts the NEXTEL All-Star Challenge race in
mid-May and then holds the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend,
which begins in the late afternoon and ends at night. And in 2004, the
UAW-GM 500 in October was held at night.
 Richmond International Raceway holds night races every time NASCAR
comes to the track.
 California Speedway outside Los Angeles starts races in the afternoon,
with drivers taking the checkered flag at night.
For the drivers, night racing has a slightly different feel from racing during
the day. The lighting systems have become so good that drivers actually can
see more of the track, including many of the bumps and dips of the racing
surface. Also, night races are cooler than daytime racing, especially in the
summertime — and comfort means a lot when you’re racing in (or watching)
a three-hour race in the steam bath of Central Florida in July. The fans love
night racing for the same reasons.

Who Owns the Tracks?
In the old days of stock-car racing, big-wig companies didn’t own racetracks —
people did. Families or individuals with money or land built small tracks in
their communities so that people could enjoy racing and watching races there.
Now, though, individually owned racetracks, at least on the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series level, aren’t common. The big companies have taken over.
Two large companies, both publicly-owned with stock traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, own most of the 22 tracks hosting NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series races: International Speedway Corporation (ISC) and Speedway
Motorsports, Inc. (SMI).
Here are the owners of the 22 tracks in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series races:
 International Speedway Corporation, or ISC, as it’s known in the racing
world, is the company that owns most of the tracks that host NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series races. ISC is based in Daytona Beach, Florida. ISC
owns the following NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racetracks: California
Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Daytona
International Speedway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, Kansas Speedway,
Martinsville Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, Phoenix
International Raceway, Richmond International Raceway, Talladega
Superspeedway, and Watkins Glen International.

Night moves
Night races often provide plenty of excitement,
with all the sparks flying off the cars and the blur
of colors racing by. But drivers and crews also
find racing under the lights thrilling for another
reason. Racing on Saturday nights gives us
Sunday off. So we don’t mind that night races
last until nearly midnight. After the races, we
rush to our planes to get home as soon as pos-
sible, so we can go to sleep in our own beds and
sleep late the next day. That gives us an extra
day to spend with our families, go to our family
church, run errands, or do things normal people
do on weekends. It’s kind of weird waking up on
Sunday with no race to drive in, but drivers
relish the moment, especially because our
schedules are so packed during the week. It’s
no wonder that my wife and son love Saturday
night races, too!
For a fan, night racing isn’t too bad, either. After
the race, you don’t have to drive or fly home
early the next morning to be at work on time.
You can relax in your hotel or campground for
one more night, then leisurely get up the next
morning and mosey all the way home without
any stress.

 Speedway Motorsports Inc., or SMI, is NASCAR’s second-largest speed-
way owner. It is based in Concord, North Carolina, and O. Bruton Smith
is the CEO. SMI owns the following NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series tracks:
Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Infineon Raceway,
Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Lowe’s Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor
Speedway.
 Dover Motorsports, Inc., runs the Dover International Speedway.
 The rest of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series tracks are owned by families
who have held onto their tracks and not sold out to huge companies yet:
• Indianapolis Motor Speedway is owned by the Hulman-George
family. (Hulman Co.)
• New Hampshire International Speedway is owned by the Bahre
family.
• Pocono Raceway is owned by the Mattioli family.
So even though big companies have entered the speedway ownership busi-
ness, there are families that still own tracks.
A Snapshot of Each NASCAR 
NEXTEL Cup Track
With 22 tracks in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, how do you choose which
one to go to? NASCAR weekends aren’t inexpensive (after including tickets,
travel, food, and lodging) so you should consider your options carefully.
Do you like the bumping and banging of a short track? Do the high speeds of
a superspeedway get you pumped up? Do the thrills of a night race on an
intermediate track get your heart racing? If you’re not sure, watch a few races
on television before you decide which track to go to. This section gives you
the specs on each of the tracks. (Check out Chapter 8 for a description of the
different track shapes.)
After you decide which track you like the best, call for tickets right away. Many
times, races are sold out months — or even a year — in advance! The same
goes for making hotel reservations. Race fans tend to stay at the same hotel
year after year, renewing their reservations before they leave to ensure they
have a place to stay the next year. So, if you’re looking for lodging, start plan-
ning way in advance, perhaps by calling the local tourist bureau or chamber of
commerce to see what’s available. Also, if you want to camp out at the track
(in the infield or adjacent to the track), many facilities require reservations —
call the track for information. (See Chapter 14 for more info on getting tickets
and lodging.)

Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

Atlanta Motor Speedway
Atlanta Motor Speedway hosts two NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series events each
year, one in the spring and one in the fall. Both those events are lightning-fast
because the track is high-banked and was repaved and reconfigured into a
quad oval in 1997 (see Figure 13-1). The newly-paved track causes cars to
stick to the track more so drivers can go faster through the turns without
worrying about losing control. For example, Geoffrey Bodine set the track
qualifying record for the NAPA 500 in 1997, the first NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series race after the track was repaved. He went a blistering 197.498 mph,
which is ultra-fast and ultra-scary for a driver on a 1.54-mile track.
Track specs
 Shape: Quad-oval, which is a modified oval with two extra, very slight
turns. Those turns are located part-way down the frontstretch, one on
each side of the start/finish line.
 Length: 1.54 miles.
 Banking: 24 degrees in the turns and 5 degrees in the straightaways.
Dates to watch
Mid-March and late October.

The key to enjoying a race at Atlanta Motor Speedway is avoiding the traffic.
Get to the racetrack extra early if you want to see the green flag fall, otherwise
you may be listening to the beginning of the race on your car radio. Also, make
sure to bring a raincoat to the spring race because it tends to rain — or perhaps
even snow! — at some point during the weekend.
Bristol Motor Speedway
Even though Bristol is one of NASCAR’s tiniest tracks at a half-mile, it doesn’t
lack action. Far from it. In fact, an improved speedway and grandstands and the
intense on-track action have made it the hardest ticket to get on the circuit.
The track has a concrete racing surface and the steepest banks on the circuit,
with a neck-straining 36-degree banking in the turns (see Figure 13-2). People
liken it to a Roman coliseum because more than 147,000 seats tower above the
small track. Drivers describe racing at the track by comparing it to flying a
Learjet around a clothes dryer or maneuvering a speed boat around a toilet.
There’s not much room on the track, but there’s a whole lot of noise in the
place — particularly with 43 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series cars circling the
track and the roar of the engines reverberating off the aluminum grandstands.
Bristol is nicknamed “The World’s Fastest Half-Mile” for a reason — cars lap
the track in about 15 seconds. Blink a few times, and you’ve already missed
the lead cars going by. The track hosts two NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
events each year, one in the spring and another in late summer. The late
summer event is held at night and is one of racing’s hottest tickets.
Track specs
 Shape: Standard oval.
 Length: .533 miles.
 Banking: 36 degrees in the turns and 16 degrees in the straightaways.

If you want to go to a race at Bristol, getting tickets may be difficult. Events
are sold out years in advance, with most ticket holders keeping their seats
from year to year. You can get to a race if you scour the classified section in
racing magazines or newspapers for somebody selling tickets. Bristol does
reserve tickets for each season that you can enter a drawing for. Check out
its Web site for more information. Or you can take your chances and head to
Bristol without tickets, hoping to bump into somebody hawking tickets near
the track. 
California Speedway
You’ll find only two NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series tracks on the West coast,
and California Speedway is one of them (see Figure 13-3). The track was built
by legendary IndyCar owner Roger Penske and is one of the snazziest tracks
around. Drivers love it because it’s laid out the way many think a track
should be: it’s a regular oval, not shaped like a dog’s hind leg. Also, the racing
surface is nice and smooth, making it a dream to drive on. In fact, the entire
facility is a dream. It has meticulously groomed grounds along with neat park-
ing lots and grandstands. The track workers smile and wave, even when they
have to get up at 4 a.m. and direct traffic all day. The traffic flow to and from
the speedway isn’t too bad, either. It’s a great place to incorporate into a
family vacation to Disneyland. The track hosts two events each season.

jams are a Southern California staple.
Chicagoland Speedway
One of the newest speedways in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, Chicagoland
Speedway has quickly become a favorite of the drivers (see Figure 13-4). In
addition to being a modern facility, it’s close to some of the best restaurants in
the country. While drivers don’t have much time to act as tourists, they enjoy
visiting the city and taking in its sites and sounds when they can. Since the
track’s opening in 2001, Kevin Harvick has been the man to beat, logging back-
to-back victories in 2001 and 2002. Ryan Newman was the winner in 2003, and
Tony Stewart (considered by many Midwesterners to be a home-town boy)

Darlington Raceway
Darlington is one of NASCAR’s oldest and most ornery tracks. It was built in
1950 and is NASCAR’s original superspeedway, which back then was any
paved track a mile or longer (see Figure 13-5). Over the years, it earned a
nickname as “The Track Too Tough to Tame” and there’s a good reason for
that. Most drivers can’t tame it — and many drivers have trouble driving it.
The speedway is egg shaped, meaning one end (turns 1 and 2) has tighter
turns than the other. The banking on the end with the tighter turns is two
degrees steeper than the other end. Drivers have to pay attention to keep
from smacking into the wall. Then again, smacking the wall at a storied place
like Darlington is part of a NASCAR driver’s rite of passage. Driving close to
the wall is mandatory. Your car drifts up the groove on the racetrack and
ends up only inches from the wall, many times scraping it and leaving a stripe
on the car from the wall’s paint. Over the years, that stripe has become
known as the Darlington Stripe — and every driver who has raced there has
earned it, whether he’s a rookie or a veteran. Although Darlington isn’t near
a big city like the California Speedway and doesn’t have sky boxes, it has its
own history. While for many years it hosted a race during Labor Day week-
end, beginning in 2005 that event will be held Mother’s Day weekend in May.
Track specs
 Shape: Egg-shaped oval.
 Length: 1.366 miles.
 Banking: 25 degrees in turns 1 and 2; 23 degrees in turns 3 and 4; and 
2 degrees on the straightaways.
Dates to watch
Saturday of Mother’s Day weekend.

The track is in Darlington, South Carolina, about 75 miles east of Columbia

Daytona International Speedway
Daytona International Speedway is the most famous track in NASCAR racing,
mostly because Daytona Beach is where NASCAR began. Even before NASCAR
was founded, racers would flock to Daytona’s hard-packed sand beaches to
go head-to-head against each other while trying to avoid the incoming tide.
Now, though, those racers and millions of fans each year flock to the 2.5-mile
superspeedway a few miles inland from where NASCAR stock-car racing
started (see Figure 13-6).
The high-banked, high-speed track hosts two official NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series races each year — the Daytona 500 and the Pepsi 400, formerly known
as the Firecracker 400. The track also holds the Budweiser Shootout, which is
a non-points race about a week before the Daytona 500 consisting of pole win-
ners from the previous year and one wildcard entry.
For the most part, race fans don’t just show up in Daytona Beach the day
before the Daytona 500 because there’s plenty to see before the big event. The
track hosts more than two weeks of racing each February, a time of the year
known as Speedweeks. The annual series of events starts out with the Rolex 24
at Daytona, a sports-car endurance race. The stock-car portion kicks off with
pole qualifying and the Budweiser Shootout. The NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series and the NASCAR Busch Series have their season-opening events — 
followed by the Daytona 500 on the final Sunday of Speedweeks.
The track decided to give competitors and fans a break from the heat, sched-
uling the summer Pepsi 400 in the evening.

Chapter 13: Getting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
A preponderance of pond
Why is Darlington shaped so strangely? Well, at
first it wasn’t to make the track challenging for
drivers. When building the track, the original
owner, Harold Brasington, wanted his speedway
to have sweeping turns all the way around, but a
local farmer refused to sell his fish pond — the
one that sat right in the way of one end of the
proposed track — so Brasington had to squeeze
that end of the track to fit it in the allocated spot.
He also had to make the banking steeper on that
end to make the turn easier for drivers to negoti-
ate. Years later, the fish pond is still there and the
track still boasts its weird shape. Good for the
fish, tough for the drivers.

There’s nothing prim or proper about Dover International Speedway (see

dirty (with dust kicked up everywhere), and it’s good, hard racing (with fast
cars running close together). For drivers, though, it’s not quite relaxing
enough. The racing surface used to be asphalt, but it’s concrete now, making
the ride bumpier than usual. Imagine driving down a concrete highway and

NASCAR’s Super Bowl
The Daytona 500, held at Daytona International
Speedway each February, is the most famous
stock-car race in the world. It’s NASCAR’s Super
Bowl and is the race every driver dreams of win-
ning. Why is it such a big deal? Not only does 
it pay the most money, but it also has the most
prestige.
Some of the most legendary drivers in the world
have won the event, including Richard Petty (a
record seven times!), Cale Yarborough, and
even Indy 500 winners Mario Andretti and A.J.
Foyt. Dale Earnhardt considered it the biggest
feather in his cap, and son Dale Earnhardt Jr.,
added it to his resume in 2004. But if you win the
Daytona 500, not only do you join that elite group
of drivers — but you also get loads of fame. The
winner goes on a whirlwind media tour the
week after making it to the famed Victory Lane,
making appearances on national TV shows like
Late Night with David Letterman or the Tonight
Show. So, if you’re not famous when you win it,
you will be by the time the week is over.
Winning the Daytona 500 is quite an accomplish-
ment because about 200,000 fans watch it in
person and millions of people watch it on TV, but
there’s something even more special about win-
ning the 500-mile race. The driver who wins it
feels pretty darn good about his upcoming
season — the Daytona 500 kicks off the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series season every year and doing
well in the race boosts a driver’s (and his team’s)
confidence heading into the rest of the season.

hearing the “Thump-thump! Thump-thump!” of the wheels riding over the 
concrete seams on the road. Well, that’s how drivers feel as their car travels
over the rough concrete — and 400 miles of that thump-thumping isn’t what I
call a mellow afternoon. Most of the time, though, fans get their money’s worth
at the track dubbed the “Monster Mile,” even though the drivers are exhausted
and cranky when the day is over. While there’s not much passing, the cars go
frighteningly fast down the straightaways and into the high-banked turns.

there than with the ones closer to the track.
Homestead-Miami Speedway
The 1.5-mile track south of Miami (see Figure 13-8) used to be called the
Metro-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex, but it was renamed the
Homestead-Miami Speedway in mid-1998, just before NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series’ first race there in November 1999. When NASCAR hit south Florida, it
was quite a culture clash. NASCAR has a distinctly southern, old-fashioned
twinge to it. South Florida, on the other hand, is known for its international
flair and the cutting-edge fashion of the South Beach area. But NASCAR racers
and fans seemed to enjoy the trip south anyway, especially because of the
weather in Homestead, which is normally mild in late November. Many NASCAR
Busch Series competitors stay there for vacations after they’re done racing
because the series’ season finale is there.

When booking a hotel in the Homestead area, you may be tempted to search
in and around Miami but don’t forget to look south of the speedway, too. The
Florida Keys are just over 45 minutes south of the track, and staying there
gives you the opportunity to enjoy gorgeous blue ocean waters and white
sand beaches while still staying relatively close to the track. Also, after the
race most of the traffic flows north to Miami, so by staying in the Keys, your
trip back may be easier.
Indianapolis Motor Speedway
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, nicknamed the “Brickyard” because its racing
surface used to be paved with bricks, is hallowed grounds for IndyCar racing.
It was built in 1909 and is the oldest continuously operating track in the
world. The Brickyard became legendary for hosting the Indianapolis 500, the
Homestead-Miami Speedway

nation’s marquee event for Indy cars, where more than 400,000 fans pack into
the grandstands and infield. Because the track is such an IndyCar racing icon,
many people thought hell would freeze over before stock cars raced on (and
desecrated) the track.
Well, as it turned out, hell did freeze over. In 1994, the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series competed at the Brickyard for the first time, breaking tradition at the
2.5-mile track (see Figure 13-9). Now, the Brickyard 400 is one of NASCAR’s
most prestigious races.
When NASCAR comes to the Brickyard, the race is technically a sell-out,
although no infield tickets are sold. Even so, there are almost 300,000 fans in
the grandstands to see the Brickyard 400 — which makes it the biggest race,
in terms of fan attendance, on the NASCAR circuit. Drivers get to see those
fans, too. The turns are nearly 90 degrees, making it seem as if you’re going to
drive right into the grandstands before easing off the throttle to turn drasti-
cally left. It’s scary, especially for rookies who aren’t used to the sharp turns,
high speeds on the straightaways, and racing in on the narrow speedway. As a
driver, you just have to get used to it before you feel comfortable, which may
take a few years because NASCAR only races once a year at the speedway.
Track specs
 Shape: Four-cornered oval, which is nearly a rectangle because the turns
are almost at 90-degree angles.
 Length: 2.5 miles.
 Banking: 9 degrees in the turns and flat straightaways.
Dates to watch
Early August.
The track is at Indianapolis, Indiana (technically in a town called Speedway),
and is located about seven miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis. To get
there, take Exit 16A (the Speedway/Clermont exit) off I-465 west; then go east
on 16th Street to the track.
Getting tickets
Tickets for the Brickyard 400 are primarily sold by mail order. Call 317-484-
6700 for an order form or write to P.O. Box 24152, Speedway, IN 46224. The
race sells out quickly, so you must call or write for an order form at least one
month before the August race if you want to get tickets before they’re sold
out. In addition, tickets may be available through the speedway’s Web site at
www.brickyard400.com.

No matter how high you get in the grandstands, your view of Indy’s huge 
2.5-mile track is limited. When buying tickets, your best bet is to sit somewhere
in the frontstretch section where you can see cars come out of turn four, race
down the straightaway, and then barrel through turn 1. But get the seats facing
the infield, not the ones in the infield, if you want to have the best vantage

Infineon Raceway
For those mellow, wine-drinking race fans, Infineon Raceway in Sonoma,
California, may be the quintessential venue (see Figure 13-10). The track,
located in the heart of Sonoma Valley’s wine country, is a twisting, turning
road course with as many elevation changes as there are wineries nearby.
Drivers have to deal with sharp turns, dips, and hills throughout the race,
so it’s exhausting as much as it is demanding.

Fans have it all together different. They are spread throughout the hills sur-
rounding the track, drinking wine, snacking, and cavorting while watching the
race. You can find some grandstand seating, but not much, so be prepared to
bring a blanket and food so you can chill out while your wine chills. Then you
can watch the race and enjoy the spectacular scenery of the valley. The track
hosts one NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series race each year.

Don’t expect to see the entire racetrack if you’re going to an event at Infineon.
The track is so big and has so many dips and turns, that there’s just no way to
see the whole thing. So, when hunkering down to watch the race from the hill-
side, try to pick a place where you’ll see at least one of the turns. That’s where
you’ll find a lot of the action on a road course because a lot of passing is done
there.
Kansas Speedway
New to the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series in 2001, the modern Kansas Speedway,
which plays host to 80,000 fans, quickly became a driver favorite (see Figure
13-11). Located in the heart of the United States, Kansas Speedway is a favorite
of multiple winner Jeff Gordon (2001–2002) and 2003 winner Ryan Newman.
Although the drivers enjoy racing on tracks with a long history, there also is
excitement that comes from racing at a new venue. At Kansas, the accommoda-
tions are excellent, including a top-of-the-line garage area and a smooth track
surface.

Las Vegas Motor Speedway
If you’re a race fan who loves nightlife, the Las Vegas Motor Speedway is your
mecca for NASCAR racing. During the day, you get to watch great racing on a
track that drivers love because there’s plenty of room to drive (see Figure
13-12). Drivers can run on the bottom, in the middle, or on top — which is
great because, as you’ve probably figured out, racers love having a lot of room
to work with so they can pass the cars in front of them. While you’re watching
the racing, you can’t help but notice the track’s breathtaking surroundings.
The McCullough Mountain Range is in the distance, plus Nellis Air Force Base
isn’t far, either, often providing a free air show of F-14s flying in formation.
After you’re done watching racing, you can get out of your racetrack duds, put
on a fancy-schmancy outfit, and explore the town. Las Vegas is nicknamed “The
Entertainment Capital of the World” because of its dozens of casinos, hundreds

When Vegas nightlife gets too expensive, perhaps a more down-to-earth
option is sticking around the speedway. There’s a dirt track around the
corner from the track, where you can see even more racing after the NASCAR
garages close for the evening. Those races, held under the lights, don’t host
NASCAR cars. They have other cars and other series, including the World of
Outlaws Series, which features sprint cars with a large wing on top. 
Lowe’s Motor Speedway
Most NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series drivers live in the Charlotte, North
Carolina, area, so it’s no wonder they love racing at Lowe’s Motor Speedway.
Three times per year, many drivers get to sleep in their own beds on race
weekends instead of in a hotel or their motor homes. Drivers also like the
track because you can pass on it and go very fast (see Figure 13-13).
The 1.5-mile track, formerly known as Charlotte Motor Speedway, is the first
NASCAR track to change its name because owners sold its naming rights.
Expect many more tracks to change their names in the future due to bigger
money being offered by companies to change names. But, whatever the name
of the track, the facility hasn’t lost any of its glitz. It has many luxury sky boxes
just as other tracks do, but it also has two condominiums built at one end of
the track, where many drivers and fans own condos overlooking the racetrack.
How exciting it must be to wake up in your own condo in the morning and
glance out your window to see a group of gritty race teams testing their cars. Or
just think, you can have a dinner party and watch races while nibbling on hors
d’oeuvres and sipping on chardonnay. You’ll also find the ritzy Speedway Club
at the track, which is racing’s version of a country club. It’s a concept dreamed
up by Speedway Motorsports CEO Bruton Smith and speedway president H.A.
“Humpy” Wheeler, two of the most innovative, creative promoters in the sport.
In addition to hosting the NEXTEL All-Star Challenge event each May, Lowe’s
Motor Speedway hosts two NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series events each year,
including the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend, which television num-
bers have shown has more viewers then the Indianapolis 500. By contrast,
Lowe’s Motor Speedway plays host to approximately 160,000 fans, while
Indianapolis brings in a live crowd of 350,000.

Knob Hill Road, and you’ll find more race shops than you can visit in one day,
including Roush Racing and Penske Racing South. Most race shops have a
free visitors’ area, where you can take a peek at the race teams preparing
cars. Many also have souvenir shops.
Martinsville Speedway
Martinsville’s .526-mile oval is the tiniest track in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
racing and also is one of the oldest (see Figure 13-14). It was built in 1947 and
even pre-dates the NASCAR organization itself. Good old Martinsville is a typi-
cal short track with not much room to pass and a bumpy racing surface. The
tricky part is that it’s concrete through the turns and asphalt in the straight-
aways. Some drivers lovingly call it two drag strips attached by two U-turns.
Some just call it frustrating. With little room to get by the car in front of you,
drivers know they must qualify well in order to have a decent finish. But qual-
ifying well doesn’t exempt you from finishing the race unscathed. Even though
Martinsville isn’t high banked the way Bristol is, cars still get bumped and
banged during the race. There just isn’t anywhere to hide, especially when
somebody spins out or wrecks just in front of you.

Humpy’s pre-race festivities
Humpy Wheeler, president of Lowe’s Motor
Speedway, is known especially for his pre-race
festivities, which border on the outrageous.
Nevertheless, they are unforgettable. For
instance, before the Coca-Cola 600 (formerly the
World 600) each year, he calls in the National
Guard to perform a military exercise, filled with
loud booms and plenty of billowing smoke. But
Wheeler has had some brilliant ideas over the
years, including the NEXTEL All-Star Challenge
each May, which features NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series winners. The all-star race has differ-
ent rules and is not an official points event.

Getting to the track
The track is located two miles south of Martinsville, Virginia, and about
50 miles south of Roanoke. To get there, take U.S. 220 Business south. From
Greensboro Airport, take Route 68 north to U.S. 220 north to the track.

Michigan International Speedway
With Detroit just about an hour away, executives from the car companies
don’t have to travel far to see some of the best racing in the sport. That’s
because many racers deem Michigan International Speedway as one of the
best tracks they drive on (see Figure 13-15). There’s plenty of room to race on
the speedway’s wide straightaways and turns, making it easy for drivers to
take the low route, the high route, or any route they choose to get by some-
body in front of them. Michigan is also one of the fastest tracks in the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series because of the long straightaways and the relatively high
banking. And unlike cars at Daytona and Talladega, cars at Michigan don’t
have to use restricted motors that cut down on horsepower and speed.
While drivers love the 2-mile oval, fans may wonder why the track is so allur-
ing. Sure, the wide, fast racing surface is easy to negotiate, but that makes for
few accidents and cautions. Many times, races at Michigan come down to a
battle of which team gets the best fuel mileage or which team pumps out the
fastest pit stop — not which driver makes the most dramatic, thrilling moves
on the track to take the lead.

New Hampshire International Speedway
Yes, there’s hope for New Englanders who want to see a NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series race but don’t want to drive all over creation to do it — a 1-mile
track in Loudon, New Hampshire. The speedway (see Figure 13-16) is a huge
version of the Martinsville Speedway. It has sharp turns, a slick racing sur-
face, long straightaways, and not enough room in the corners to pass the
cars in front, even if the car in back is much faster. In fact, there isn’t much
room to pass anywhere on the track, which is why qualifying up front is so
important.

summer when the nights are much cooler and crisper than in the steamy
south and once in the fall just as leaves on the trees start to turn colors. The
fall race is the first race in which NASCAR’s top-10 drivers begin contending
for the championship. 
By the way, racers never call the track New Hampshire International Speedway.
It’s just called “Loudon,” short and sweet. (There are too many syllables in New
Hampshire International Speedway, and racers are always in a rush, rush, rush.)

Phoenix International Raceway
With the majestic Sierra Estrella Mountains in the background, Phoenix
International Raceway is one of the most picturesque tracks in NASCAR
racing. It’s also one of the most oddly shaped tracks (see Figure 13-17).
Instead of being a plain, old oval, Phoenix is shaped like a reverse “D”
because the track’s owner didn’t want to alter the facility’s road course to
accommodate an oval.
Phoenix isn’t a high-banked track and the turns are tricky because turns 1
and 2 have different degrees of banking than turns 3 and 4. Each turn is chal-
lenging. Turns 1 and 2 are tight, with the wall coming out of nowhere as you
come out of turn 2. Turns 3 and 4 are more sweeping, with a subtle turn (or
dogleg) in the backstretch just to make things more interesting. The NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series drivers race here twice each year.
Track specs
 Shape: D-shaped oval.
 Length: 1 mile.
 Banking: 11 degrees in turns 1 and 2; 9 degrees in turns 3 and 4; and
zero degrees on the straightaways.

best buy at the raceway. Bring a blanket and binoculars if you plan to park
yourself on the hill.
Pocono Raceway
Pocono’s triangular racetrack, tucked into the Pocono Mountains (a haven
for honeymooners in the northeast), may very well be the most difficult and
frustrating track in NASCAR. It isn’t a regular oval, a D-shaped oval, a road
course, or a superspeedway. It’s a combination of all those tracks. It has
three straights, each a different length, and three corners, each a different
length and with a different level of banking (see Figure 13-18). It rivals any
superspeedway for pure speed because of its long front straightaway, which
is the longest straight stretch of road in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series racing.
Cars can reach 200 mph as they barrel down that straight. Going into the

turns, though, cars aren’t going that fast. That’s where Pocono the super-
speedway turns into Pocono the road course because the turns are so differ-
ent. In fact, drivers must downshift and upshift at least two times per lap.
The most heart-stopping turn at Pocono is turn 2, known as the “tunnel turn”
because the tunnel into the infield is beneath the turn. It’s also considered
the toughest turn in racing. The groove in the tunnel turn is extremely
narrow, so cars must negotiate the turn single file. If they don’t, they’ll end up
smacking into the wall. It’s also a relatively flat turn, which makes it tough to
negotiate because the cars are still going really fast after the trip down the
long frontstretch and through the banked first turn. Turn 3 is relatively easier.
It’s a wider turn with more racing room.
With those three very different turns on the same course, drivers and teams
have to set up their cars carefully. They must learn to make compromises
in order to get the best out of their vehicles through each lap. Sometimes,
teams choose to set up their cars for turn 3 so the driver is better equipped
to make a pass there and carry some momentum down the long stretch. But
that means that going through turns 1 and 2 could be interesting.

Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

Looking for an autograph of your favorite driver? On the way from the garage
to pit road, there’s a small grandstand where fans with pit passes can sit and
wait for a glimpse of drivers and crews. It’s called “autograph alley” because
there are a few windows built into the fence in front of the stands, where fans
can hand drivers hats, T-shirts, programs, and other souvenirs to sign. Sit
there long enough and a driver is bound to come by and oblige you.
Richmond International Raceway
Many drivers consider Richmond International Raceway the best short track
in NASCAR. Even though it’s only three-quarters of a mile long, there’s still
enough room for you to race up high, down low, or in the middle (see Figure
13-19). If drivers want to make a pass, they can do it anywhere they want
instead of waiting for a wide enough spot on the racetrack. While drivers
love the place, fans don’t think it’s too shabby, either. It hosts two nighttime
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series races each year, becoming electric with the cars
circling the racetrack under the lights. When fans snap photographs, the
flashbulbs make the grandstand look as if it’s filled with fireflies. And when

Finding lodging
The speedway publishes its own fan guide, which includes information on
local hotels and restaurants. To receive a guide, send a self-addressed,
stamped, business-sized envelope (with 78 cents postage) to Fan Friendly
Guide, P.O. Box 9257, Richmond, VA 23227-9257.
To reach the Richmond Convention and Visitors Bureau, call 800-365-7272.
The best seats at Richmond are in the turns, but it’s hard to be picky about
where you sit when tickets are so hard to come by. The track holds a lottery
to handle requests for tickets, so take what you can get. But if you have a
choice, pick the Dogwood grandstands or the Old Dominion grandstands
where you can get a good view of the cars going through the turns.
Talladega Superspeedway
According to legend, Talladega is haunted because it was built on an old
Native American burial ground. There’s no doubt that Talladega is the
biggest, meanest, and fastest track in NASCAR racing. Bill Elliott set the speed
record for stock cars in 1987 when he won the pole for the Winston 500 with
a 212.809 mph lap. Obviously, that was before NASCAR mandated carburetor
restrictor plates (see Chapter 5) to slow down the cars.
Talladega is Daytona International Speedway’s sister track, built almost to
the same specifications although, at 2.66-miles around, it’s slightly bigger
(see Figure 13-20).

Texas Motor Speedway
When Texas Motor Speedway opened in 1997, drivers were concerned about
the racing surface. But after millions of dollars of renovations and reconfigu-
rations to improve the racing surface and the turns, the track has become
popular (see Figure 13-21). Fans have noticed other improved parts of the
speedway, such as the Speedway Club and condos at one end of the track.
The club houses a gourmet restaurant with dinner and dancing after the race
and also holds a state-of-the-art gym for locals to work out in. All that has
made the facility one of the most innovative tracks in racing.

Watkins Glen International
Unlike Infineon Raceway, Watkins Glen International is more of a modified
oval with mostly right turns instead of left turns (see Figure 13-22). It also
doesn’t have the drastic sharp turns of Infineon Raceway, so cars can lap the
track much faster. One of the best things about “the Glen,” as it’s affectionately
called, is that fans can get a great view of the track by perching themselves
at various points around the speedway. Still, you can’t see the entire track
because it sprawls so much. The track hosted Formula One racing’s U.S. Grand
Prix from 1961 to 1980, but now its biggest race is when NASCAR comes to
the tiny town in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.

drivers most often make their moves. The esses is a part of the track where
cars snake through the course in a series of turns, and it’s an especially good
part of the track to watch from because the cars snake right up a hill. Sit at
the top of the hill and you’ll see plenty of action.

G
oing to a NASCAR race isn’t like going to a professional basketball
game. It’s more like going to Woodstock. Fans make pilgrimages to
NASCAR races, sometimes driving across the country to their favorite tracks.
And when they get there, they enter a unique universe.
Often, NASCAR fans camp out on speedway grounds or near the speedway
before an event. They bring their tents, motor homes, campers, and vans to
the track and then party like there’s no tomorrow. You think tailgating before
a college football game is a blast? Well, you haven’t seen anything unless
you’ve trekked to a NASCAR race. From 70,000 to 300,000 fans descend on
NASCAR tracks during race weekends. They bring their NASCAR hats,
NASCAR T-shirts, NASCAR flags, and NASCAR bumper stickers. But most of
all, they bring their loyalties to their favorite NASCAR drivers. While fans at
basketball games cheer for one team or the other, fans at NASCAR races are
cheering for 43 different teams.
If you decide you have to be part of this mania, this chapter’s for you. I tell
you everything you need to know about having a great race weekend, from
getting tickets and lodging, to what to bring on race day, to getting back to
meet your favorite drivers.

Getting Your Tickets for a Race
Before you head to a NASCAR race, you want to have tickets for the event in
hand. This section offers some different ways to get tickets and also helps
you decide what tickets you want to get.
Tips on buying tickets
Most races sell out weeks or months before the event, so tickets are hard to
come by. They can also be quite pricey, ranging from $25 to more than $250.
Keep in mind that some tracks sell discounted tickets for children. (See
Chapter 13 for information on how to get tickets at each of the NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series tracks.) Here are some tips for getting tickets to events:
 Call the track ticket office as soon as possible, even a year before an
event, to get information on securing tickets for the race you want to see.
Tickets for races go on sale long before the event, so if you call early,
you increase your chances of going to an event (and getting the best
seats). If the race is sold out, some tracks can put you on a waiting list
just in case more seats open up. Or you can stay on the waiting list until
a season-ticket holder decides to give up his or her tickets.
 If you’re computer-savvy, you can get on the Internet and check to see
whether a track sells tickets on its Web site. (See Chapter 13 for Web
site addresses.) Sometimes, tracks reserve a chunk of seats and save
them for Internet-based customers. Check the Web sites for details.
 Flip through the classified section of your local newspaper or national
racing publication. Fans sell their tickets to sold-out races all the time,
so if you keep your eyes open for tickets to the race or racetrack of your
dreams, you may get lucky.
224
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
What a suite deal
Above the grandstands at the majority of tracks
are rows of boxes encased in glass where people
gather to watch races. These are the suites and
you can’t buy tickets at the box office to sit in
them. They’re for corporations or people with
enough money to rent them out. Usually, compa-
nies rent the suites for thousands of dollars each
race and then invite employees, colleagues,
clients, friends, or family members to watch the
race. All the suites have TVs, so you can see all
the action, including replays of big wrecks or key
passes. Most also have catered lunches or din-
ners, so you can dine in air-conditioned comfort
while the drivers bump and bang on the track. It’s
a luxurious way to watch a race and a great way
to entertain a group.

 Drive or walk around a racetrack to find fans selling their unused tick-
ets. Sometimes, fans buy too many tickets and have extras on race day.
Beware of scalpers who charge too much and put you at risk for buying
counterfeit tickets.
Whenever you buy tickets from a place other than the racetrack, however,
you’re taking your chances that the tickets may be outrageously priced or
even counterfeit. Be aware that in most states, it’s illegal for someone to sell
tickets to an event if they aren’t properly licensed. In other states, it’s illegal
for someone to charge more than face value for tickets. Still more states have
laws about how much a scalper can boost the ticket price over face value. It
may be tiresome to find out what the local laws are regarding scalping tick-
ets, but it’s worth it. Depending on the jurisdiction, you can get fined or even
arrested for buying tickets illegally. To check on specific scalping laws, call
that state’s chamber of commerce or the police department located closest
to the track.
Grandstands or infield?
When buying NASCAR tickets, you have the option of getting tickets for the
grandstands or for the infield (for some tracks). Each location gives you a dif-
ferent feel of racing, and one is no better than the other — it just depends on
what you want to get out of your trip to the racetrack.
Sitting in the grandstands
Most fans watch races from the grandstands. The grandstands give you the
best view of the track, and you ensure yourself a seat because you purchase
tickets for specific seats. It’s the traditional way to do things. It’s just like sit-
ting in the stands at a football game, but much louder — not because of the
people around you, but because of the roar of the engines as the cars go
around the track. And you get to make friends with the person you’re sitting
next to, whether you like it or not, because the seats are so close together.
Keep in mind the best seats are the highest seats, which isn’t the case in
most sporting events. Sitting up higher gives you a better view of the entire
track, while sitting lower gives you a perfect view of cars zooming by — and
that’s about it. All you see is a blur. So this is one sporting event where you
don’t want to be in the front row.
Camping out in the infield
Not all tracks, and particularly not the smaller ones, allow fans in the infield.
The tracks that do offer infield tickets, however, are packed not only on race
day, but also throughout the weekend with people camping out. Most fans
who choose the infield drive motor homes and park them as close to the
track as possible. The tickets are general admission because there are no
225
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track

seats in the infield, so don’t expect luxury when you get there. In addition,
infield parking passes do not allow access to the garage area, but fans are
allowed to line the fences and take pictures of their favorite driver. Watching
a race from the infield is an acquired taste, somewhat like caviar or plaid
pants. It’s a big party from the time the people stream in to the time the
people trickle out. Sometimes, you wonder if they even notice whether the
race is going on or not.
At larger tracks, the fans who drive their cars or motor homes into the infield
watch the race from on top of their vehicles. Even from those vantage points
though, fans usually can’t see the entire racetrack. You may see a bit of the
frontstretch or a turn or two, but that’s it. The rest is up to your imagination.
However, grandstand tickets usually sell out first, so the infield may be your
only option.
Even though infield tickets don’t sell out as quickly, you should still contact
the track ahead of time. Many parking spaces and camping spaces in the
infield are reserved in advance and sold out before the race comes to town.
At Daytona International Speedway, for example, motor home spaces are
reserved so that you have an exact place to set up camp. The track also has
unreserved places, which are doled out on a first-come, first-served basis. As
you can guess, the reserved spaces are more expensive and are in a better
spot inside the track than the unreserved spaces.
Also, be prepared to spend money on an infield pass for each person in your
party because buying a parking spot in the infield doesn’t grant you admission.
If you have eight people stuffed in your Winnebago, you need eight tickets.
The best part about bringing your motor home, camper, or tent into the infield
is that you get to sleep in it, so you’ll save money on lodging. While staying at
a hotel may cost $200 a night (especially on race weekends when hotels tend
to hike up their prices), staying in the infield may cost $250 for two nights.
The prices for infield camping vary widely, though, depending on whether
you get a reserved spot (which is more expensive) and how many spaces are
available. So check with the track before driving down in your pop-up camper
and $20 in your pocket.
Fans in the infield aren’t the types to show up on race day, watch the race,
and then head dutifully home right after the checkered flag falls. They usually
get to the racetrack two or three days in advance to set up their campers,
motor homes, or tents, then slip into their pre-race partying mode. They
bring their gas grills, coolers filled with beverages, and lawn chairs, and then
cavort like mad. Some cavort more during the race, and keep cavorting even
when the race is done. So, if you think you’re more apt to be a serious race-
watcher who doesn’t like distractions during an event, the grandstands may
be a better place for you.
226
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

The infield is pretty much an adult playground, so if you want to bring the
family and make a weekend out of it, ask the track if it has a family camping
area. Many tracks have staked out camping areas for families, complete with
curfews and noise limits.
Make sure to bring a gas grill if you want to cook out in the infield. Many
tracks don’t allow open fires in the camping areas.
Finding Lodging Well in Advance
Suppose you have tickets to a NASCAR race and are ready to head to the event.
If you’re making a day trip out of it, the only thing you need to worry about is
traffic. If you want to stay over a night or two, you have a bigger challenge.
Finding a place to stay near a racetrack during a NASCAR race weekend may
not be easy. Most racetracks aren’t in metropolitan cities with hotels on every
corner. They’re in smaller towns away from cities, like Talladega, Alabama, or
Dover, Delaware. There just aren’t that many hotel rooms available. Imagine
100,000 or so race fans streaming into town and looking for a place to stay. As
you can guess, space is tight.
227
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
Come on and bring the kids
NASCAR promotes itself as a family sport, with
participants who don’t mind being role models
and don’t do shocking things that athletes from
other sports have been caught doing. I think it’s
rare to find a sport like NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series racing these days, and I think that’s partly
why parents aren’t afraid to bring their kids 
to the races. Families interested in going to
NASCAR races should keep the following points
in mind, however:
 It’s not the cheapest event that you can take
your kids to, but some tracks may have spe-
cial, discounted tickets for younger children.
 It may not be a wholly G-rated experience.
Although most NASCAR fans are well
behaved, some aren’t.
 Drinking alcohol is allowed in the grand-
stands and in the infield, where fans have
been known to carry coolers filled with a
variety of beverages (although some tracks
do have alcohol-free grandstands).
Not much gallivanting goes on during races,
though. Much of it is contained to pre- and post-
race activities, so if you want to protect your
children from that hubbub, show up at the race-
track and head straight for your seats.
Racing started out as a family sport for me back
in Arkansas. Even though my parents were
divorced, racing was one way my family would
get together and have fun. So, some of my best
memories with my family were at the racetrack.
Now I’m also creating some of those same mem-
ories for my 8-year-old son, Matt, who is starting
to race quarter midgets at a small track near
where I live in Florida. Quarter midgets are open-
wheel cars small enough for young children to
drive. My wife, Arlene, and I watch him race and
always have a blast. It’s just like old times.

Before taking off for a race with your spouse and children, call beforehand to
make hotel reservations. The simplest way to find out what hotels have vacan-
cies is to call the chamber of commerce in the town where the racetrack is
located. They usually have a list of hotels with available rooms and can also
suggest hotels in your price range. (Turn to Chapter 13 for phone numbers of
the chamber of commerce in each town with a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup race.)
Because the demand for lodging is so high, hotel rooms during race week-
ends generally aren’t cheap. Expect to pay up to $150 to $250 for a hotel
room close to the track. But don’t expect to stay in luxury, even at those
prices. Even the smallest hotels increase prices when so many race fans are
looking for so few rooms.
Be aware that most hotels ask for three- or four-night minimums for race
weekends and many ask for a one-night deposit when you make the reserva-
tion. Of course, the farther away the hotel, the cheaper the room, so if you
can’t bear to part with all that cash, just get in your car and drive an hour or
so away from the track.
Leaving Early to Make the Race
To avoid the bumper-to-bumper traffic that clogs up roadways two hours or
so before the race, prepare to leave early for the race: I’m talking about at the
crack of dawn if the race is at noon. After you get to the track, you can sleep
in your car or walk around the grounds to check out what the vendors are
selling as souvenirs. You can also grab breakfast and then head to your seat
early to watch the pre-race activities. NASCAR hands out awards before each
race and introduces each driver to the crowd. Be in your seat at least 45 min-
utes before the race if you don’t want to miss all the action.
228
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Buying a program
If you’re a novice NASCAR fan, buying a race
program helps guide you through your after-
noon or evening. Programs usually contain sto-
ries about the top drivers or teams. They also
have a list of drivers, which may contain bio-
graphical information, car number, team affilia-
tion, and paint scheme (the design on a car).
While some paint schemes, such as the one on
Jeff Gordon’s multi-color No. 24 Chevy, stay 
virtually the same from year to year, some 
teams have ever-changing paint schemes. 
Keep that in mind when you’re looking for a car
on the speedway. Sometimes looking for the car
number, not the car color, is a better move.
Programs also may have race records, NASCAR
records, and charts that translate lap times into
miles per hour. As a beginner fan, all that infor-
mation, for the price of about $10, can help you
become a savvy NASCAR devotee.

Another way to avoid race-day traffic jams is to show up at the track a few
minutes before the event begins because most fans have already arrived and
taken their seats. You’re taking a chance if you do this, though, because leav-
ing just in time for a race may leave you in traffic if there’s an unexpected 
tie-up on the road.
Dos and Don’ts of Being at a Race
If you haven’t been to a race before, here’s a handy list of dos and don’ts for
you to follow:
 Do bring binoculars to a race, no matter where you’re sitting. Even if you
have the best seats in the house, it’s difficult to see the teams, cars, and
drivers up close, especially at a big track.
 Do bring a camera with a telephoto lens (which brings the action closer
to you) if you want a good picture of the cars on the track.
 Do bring earplugs, especially for children. NASCAR races are loud, with
decibel levels that can rival the roar of an airplane engine. The best
kinds of noise deterrents are headsets that actually muffle the sound.
If you’re the macho type who doesn’t want to wear earplugs, your ears
may ring and your head may hurt the next day.
 Do bring a raincoat. Umbrellas aren’t allowed in the grandstands
because they get in the way of other fans’ views of the track.
 Do dress for the weather. It can be steamy and sweltering at races held
in the summer, but cold, damp, and windy at races in the spring or fall.
Be prepared and check the weather forecast before you leave for a race.
 Do wear sunscreen. You’re a perfect candidate for sunburn when you
watch a race. You sit in aluminum grandstands for four hours in the
middle of the day. Sunscreen can prevent an uncomfortable ride home.
 Do bring a seat cushion if you want a more comfortable perch in the
stands.
 Do bring a radio or scanner (which I discuss in the “Riding Along with
the Driver” section, later in this chapter) if you want to keep track of
what’s going on during a race. Wear headphones, though, so you can
hear the conversations without the huge distraction of the engine noise.
 Do stay hydrated on hot days. Just like drivers and crews, fans need to
drink plenty of liquids to keep themselves from dehydrating. You wouldn’t
believe the number of fans who are taken to the hospital with heat stroke
or exhaustion on a hot Sunday race day.
 Do pack food if you don’t want to spend money on concessions.
 Don’t bring any glass containers into the grandstands.
229
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track

 Don’t bring any coolers that are bigger than 14x14x14 inches.
 Don’t throw anything onto the racetrack or in the grandstands. If you do,
security guards will kick you out of the speedway with no refund.
 Don’t drink too much and do crazy things. If you do, you’ll be kicked out
before you know it — which will most likely sober you up.
 Don’t curse and carry on. The people around you paid good money for
their seats and don’t want to hear you ranting about how much you dis-
like a particular driver. Also, remember that kids are in the stands.
Fitting In with a NASCAR Crowd
If you’re sitting at your first NASCAR race with a bunch of veteran fans, what
do you do to fit in? Well, if you don’t know much, the best plan is to keep
quiet, watch the race, and learn. If you want to join in on the fun, though, you
can cheer for your favorite driver and take part in some of the conversations
around you.
One sure-fire way of sounding like a longtime NASCAR fan is to refer to teams
by their car numbers. So, when talking about Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s team, you
can say, “The 8 car is really kicking it today.” Or, if someone asks which team
you like, you can say, “Oh, I like the 88.” An educated fan would immediately
know that you’re a Dale Jarrett supporter. If you really want to dazzle the fans
around you, you can use a multi-numeric scheme such as, “Wow, did you see
the 33 pass the 25 on the inside? I thought he was going to spin out the 22 or
at least smack into the 8 when he did that.”
230
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
First aid at the track
Every track has first aid centers set up through-
out the grounds, as well as a medical care
center in the infield. Experienced medical per-
sonnel are on hand to help you if you fall and
scrape your leg, hurt your back, break your
wrist, or even have a serious medical emer-
gency such as a heart attack. If you’re too hurt
to walk to a first aid center, send a friend to get
help or contact one of the ushers in the grand-
stands. Everyone is connected via two-way
radio, so help will arrive shortly.
The same goes for fans in the infield. At many
tracks with motor homes parked inside them,
emergency workers rove through the grounds
on four-wheelers. The infield care center also is
available for fans who need medical assistance.

Dressing the part also helps you fit into the crowd at NASCAR races. That
means you should at least have a T-shirt or hat with a driver’s or team’s logo
on it. You rarely see fans at a NASCAR race with plain, button-down shirts
and khakis on. If you wear an outfit like this, you’ll stick out like — like a
prepster at a Metallica concert. NASCAR fans are loyal and love to support
their drivers — and are proud to show it.
Going behind the Scenes
While grandstand tickets and infield passes give fans a great view of NASCAR
races, garage passes let you go into the pits and the garages before the race
starts and get a behind-the-scenes look at the sport. Unfortunately, fans can’t
buy garage passes at most tracks, particularly for NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
races. Those passes are reserved for sponsors, friends, and family of race
teams, or people who are affiliated with the sport in some way. Call a track
ahead of time, though, to see whether passes are for sale for other races,
especially for NASCAR Busch races or NASCAR Craftsman Truck races, which
may be less restrictive than NASCAR NEXTEL Cup races. You may get lucky.
Following the rules
If you’re lucky enough to get a garage pass, you get a unique view of the dri-
vers and the crews preparing for a NASCAR race. You can walk through the
garage area and look at crews working on their cars. You can hang out around
the team haulers (see Chapter 6 for a description) to get a glimpse of drivers
as they walk to their cars. You can take all the photos you want to remember
your day. But remember the following no-nos before heading into the garage:
 You need to stay on your toes in the NASCAR garage because you really
are in the middle of the action. Practice time is precious for NASCAR
teams, so the cars often zoom in and out of their garages to get as much
track time as possible. The drivers are focused on making their cars
just right, which means they aren’t necessarily watching out for people
strolling through the garage like tourists at Walt Disney World. 
Because of driver lobbying, fewer (non-necessary) people are allowed in
the garage area. Their complaint: There were so many people watching
the action that drivers and teams didn’t have enough room do their work.
To help solve the problem, NASCAR came up with “cold” and “hot” passes.
While some tracks sell a minimal amount of cold passes (which can be
used at times when engines are not turned on), hot passes are not for sale.
A certain amount of television, print, and radio reporters are allowed in
the garage area and along pit road when a “red light” designates a hot
period, as are drivers’ families, some sponsor representatives, and, of
course, team members.
231
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track

 When in the garage, revert to the wise words of advice your mom gave
you when the two of you took a trip to the china store when you were
six: Look, but don’t touch. You are fortunate to get a peek at NASCAR
teams at work, so don’t get uppity when someone tells you to stop
touching a piece of equipment or stand back from a car. The drivers and
crew members are at work and don’t want to be disturbed — and they
don’t want their equipment to be disturbed either. So walk through the
garage with respect.
 You must adhere to the following dress code if you want to step foot in
the garage area — no ifs, ands, or buts about it:
• You have to wear long pants. No shorts, culottes, clam diggers,
Bermuda shorts, or capris are allowed — your legs have to be 
completely covered.
• Your shirt must cover your shoulders. No tank tops, tube tops, or
sleeveless shirts allowed.
• You can’t wear open-toed shoes such as sandals, flip-flops, or
strappy stiletto high heels.
 Stay clear of the garage during Happy Hour, which is the final hour of
practice before the race. It’s dangerous to linger in the garage because
cars are rushing in and out of the garage while teams make last-minute
changes.
 Don’t bring any alcoholic beverages into the garage. They aren’t allowed.
 You must keep your garage pass visible at all times and a form of identifi-
cation in your possession; otherwise, you will be asked to leave.
Getting autographs in the garage
Usually, you can find autograph cards outside each team hauler, where drivers
and crews congregate when not working on their cars. An autograph card is a
sheet of heavy-duty paper with a driver’s picture on the front and his vital
statistics on the reverse side. It’s for — you guessed it — getting autographs.
Some people take them for souvenirs, though, because they’re free. (It’s not
good form to take more than one.)
If you want to use the autograph card to get an autograph, you can try to
corner a driver in the garage area to get him to sign it. This can be tricky busi-
ness because drivers are so focused while they’re in the garage — they’re at
work. But if you insist on getting autographs or getting your picture taken
with a driver, try to use a little courtesy. Don’t approach them as they prepare
for practice runs, prior to qualifying or immediately before the race. You will
likely fail, which builds up hard feelings between drivers and fans. Remember,
232
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

the garage is their office, and they are much more concerned with how their
car is performing then signing an autograph card. Another tip: When they do
have a few minutes of free time, most drivers will sign cards or hats fans hand
them through the fence between the garage area and the infield.
Here are some hints:
 Wait outside a team hauler to catch a driver. He isn’t around his car, so
he isn’t going to be as distracted. But don’t dare go into the hauler. It’s
off-limits to fans because that’s where drivers and teams have meetings.
 Don’t bother drivers just before qualifying. They may be nervous about
their fast lap and scowl in your photo.
 Pay attention to whether a driver is running well during practice. If
he isn’t, he probably won’t be in the mood to sign autographs. If you do
approach him for an autograph or photo, at least have something posi-
tive to say.
 Keep sponsor loyalty in mind. Think twice before asking Jeff Gordon
(a Chevy driver) to sign a Ford hat, or before asking Tony Stewart
(who drives for The Home Depot) to sign a Lowe’s Home Improvement
Warehouse T-shirt. Remember that loyalty runs deep in NASCAR. You
don’t want to put a driver in an awkward position.
 Bring your own pen. A black felt-tipped marker, such as an indelible
Sharpie, is best.
 Be prepared to walk with a driver as he signs your item. Most drivers
know that if they stop, they’ll soon be mobbed. They use the walk-and-
sign technique, so be prepared to stride alongside them.
 Don’t expect to have a full-blown conversation with a driver. They’re
on the job and trying to concentrate. If you want to chat with your
favorite driver, go to a pre-scheduled appearance he’s making in the area
(see Chapter 7 for more on drivers making appearances). For example,
Matt Kenseth may sit down and sign autographs at a local Dewalt Power
Tools outlet. No doubt he’ll be more relaxed in that atmosphere than he
is at the track.
 Even if you’ve been waiting all day in the sun, don’t chastise a driver
if he walks out to his car without stopping to give you his autograph.
Maybe he’s in a rush to get somewhere. Maybe his car isn’t running well.
Maybe he doesn’t feel well. Maybe he has personal things on his mind.
Remember: A garage pass doesn’t guarantee you autographs, but it does
guarantee you a rare look at drivers and teams at work — a look that
most people aren’t fortunate enough to get.
 Saying “thank you” always helps.
233
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track

Riding Along with the Driver
Whether you’re watching a race from the grandstands or the infield, you can
be even closer to the action if you bring a radio with a headset. The Motor
Racing Network and the Performance Racing Network radio announcers offer
analysis, race statistics, and play-by-play commentary of what’s going on
during a race. They tell you what’s going on in turn 2, when all you can see is
the cars coming out of turn 4. They also let you know what kinds of problems
different cars are experiencing. You may see Jeff Gordon slow down on the
track, but unless you’re tuned into the broadcast, you won’t know why. Local
frequencies are listed inside the packages in which the radios are purchased
and can also be found on the Internet.
A good number of fans have hand-held radio frequency scanners — Walkman-
sized instruments that pick up pre-selected two-way radio channels in the
immediate area. They allow you to listen in on conversations between drivers
and their crews during practice, qualifying, and races. You also can hear
NASCAR officials talk among themselves and with the teams. It’s sort of like
a legal way to eavesdrop — and it’s fun.
You can rent a scanner with headphones at the racetrack (at booths set up
on the grounds) for between $25 and $50 a day.
If you attend NASCAR races often, you may want to invest in your own scan-
ner. You can buy one at your local electronics store such as Radio Shack or at
radio companies that have booths at the racetrack. The scanners cost from
$100 to $350, depending on their features. Look for a scanner that scans at
least 100 channels per second, and one that scans VHF and UHF high and low
bands. Really, you don’t need a scanner much fancier than that when you’re
at a NASCAR race — you just need the correct frequencies of the drivers,
teams, officials, and radio broadcast to get your money’s worth. You can buy
updated scanner lists outside the racetrack where souvenirs are sold.
Here are some companies you can call to buy scanners or get information on
obtaining frequency lists:
 Race-Scan: 1-800-441-2841 or www.racescan.com on the Web.
 Racing Electronics: 1-800-272-7111 or www.racingelectronics.com on
the Web.
 Racing Radios: 1-800-669-1522.
If you buy or rent a scanner, be sure to get a frequency list at the track, which
has a bunch of numbers on it, each coinciding with a team, a NASCAR official,
or a radio broadcast. Usually each frequency consists of three numbers, 
234
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

followed by a decimal point and then more numbers — such as 484.340. If
you’re programming your scanner on your own, you have to input all those
numbers into the scanner and assign them another number. For example, you
can program my frequency under the number 6 on your scanner because I
drive the No. 6 Ford. So, when you tune to Channel 6 on your scanner, my 
frequency pops up and you can listen to me chat with my crew. Some teams
keep the same radio channel for years and years, but others change their fre-
quencies from time to time, so you want to get the latest frequency lists to
stay on top of all the action.
After you get your scanner and input the frequencies, you’re ready to listen
in. There are a few different techniques to listening to a race on a scanner.
You can listen to the radio broadcast, then tune into teams’ frequencies from
time to time. Or you can put your scanner on scan mode, so it stops at a fre-
quency only when there is communication going on. Or you can listen to one
team only, keeping your scanner tuned to the same frequency all day. Whatever
way you choose to use your scanner, it’s bound to make things more interest-
ing for you. You can hear a crew chief tell a driver when to make a pit stop.
You can hear a driver complain about his car. You even can hear a driver’s
reaction just after he gets into an accident.
When using a scanner, keep in mind that conversations between a team and a
driver may not be appropriate for children.
Leaving with Souvenirs
It’s hard to miss all the souvenir trailers lined up at the track. The trailers are
colorful and are always in a conspicuous area, such as just outside the main
entrance. If you have time before or after a race, you can mill around the sou-
venir area and pick up a bumper sticker, T-shirt, or cap. (For more on souvenirs,
turn to Chapter 2.) But if you really want a unique souvenir, you have to look
a bit harder.
Sometimes you’ll stumble upon someone selling racing tires that were used
in an actual NASCAR race. They go for anywhere from $10 to $60. Why would
you want a racing tire? Well, it certainly would be a conversation piece sitting
smack in the middle of your living room. Many fans lay the tires on their sides
and put a sheet of glass on top of them, which makes good coffee or end
tables. Some fans put them in their yards, fill them with dirt, and plant flow-
ers in them. Whatever their use, they are unusual souvenirs from a race.
Fans with infield passes or garage passes always comb the infield for trinkets
after an event is over: used tires, pieces of mangled sheet metal from a car
that wrecked, or even lug nuts that flew off of a car during a pit stop. If you
235
Chapter 14: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track

plan to do this, make sure the item you take is something that a team is leav-
ing behind — otherwise, you can be arrested for stealing. Ask a team whether
you can take it before you go walking off with an entire hood or a used tire.
Otherwise, you may be embarrassed when a security guard grabs you and
makes you take the piece of equipment back to its owner. Sometimes, though,
teams leave their used tires behind (without wheels) — near their pit stall or
in the garage. Those are free for your taking because they’re not going to use
them again.

M
ost NASCAR fans are lucky to attend one or two races a year. The rest
of the time, they rely on TV, radio, newspapers, and Web sites to keep
up on what’s going on. Luckily, plenty of media outlets cover NASCAR races,
NASCAR drivers, and the goings-on in the sport. In fact, NASCAR’s growth has
attracted much attention in the news, so it’s difficult to get away from it even
if you wanted to.
You can also join fan clubs or log onto a team’s Web site to catch up on the
latest news about drivers. In this chapter, I give you all the details you need
to immerse yourself in the sport — even if you can’t make it to many races.
Grab That Remote: Watching 
Races on Television
When you can’t go to races, watching them on television is a great alternative.
You may miss the roar of the engines and the smell of rubber on the track,
but in general you actually get to see more than the fans at the track. This
section gives you the advantages of watching from home (or your favorite bar),
as well as where to find NASCAR TV coverage.

238
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Catching all the angles
During every race, TV cameras mounted around the track catch the action 
at every point on the speedway. The cameras usually cover the following
angles: 
 Cars racing down the frontstretch, backstretch, and through all the
turns.
 Cars zooming by the grandstands: Sometimes in a blur of color; other
times so you can recognize which car is which, all captured by cameras
placed near the outer edge of the track.
 Fans cheering in the grandstands up close and also a view of the fans in
the grandstands taken by cameras in a blimp or helicopter above the
speedway.
 Ground shots of groups of cars coming through the turns: Those cam-
eras are positioned at ground level in the infield.
 Interior shots from cars: Several cars have in-car cameras set up during
each race. This gives viewers at home a close look at drivers while
they’re in their race cars, including what a driver sees when he swerves
to miss an accident or when he gets into an accident himself. It shows
you how violent a crash can be for a driver, too. You see the whole car
shake and hear the loud thud of the impact. You know a driver is involved
in a bad accident when the in-car camera goes dead and all you see is
static.
 Views of what’s behind and in front of cars: Small cameras mounted to
the front and back bumpers of several cars are especially helpful when
there’s an accident on the track because they give you an up-close view
of how the wreck started or who started it.
 The pit road action: You see pit crew members crouched on the pit wall,
waiting for their car to come down pit road. You also see, from all differ-
ent angles, the pit crew servicing the car.
TV cameras don’t capture only the action on the track — they bring you all the
action off the track, too. When drivers take their cars into the garage during a
race — after blowing an engine or having a wreck — the TV cameras follow.
That’s when you, as a home viewer, can see more than the people in the grand-
stands do. You see the driver get out of his car, sometimes red-faced after falling
out of a race, and you hear his explanation of why he’s in the garage and not on
the track. You also get to see the car, banged up and all.

Getting a running commentary
During every televised race, commentators describe what’s happening on
the track, which is especially helpful if you’re a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
novice. Commentators sit above the track in a booth where they can usually
see the entire speedway. Monitors keep them updated on the action and who
is running where. The commentators give you all the information you could
want, including who is where on each lap, team statistics, driver status, and
crew chief interviews. If a car stalls on the track, they tell you why. If a tire
rolls off a car and down pit road, they tell you how it happened. The commen-
tators don’t do all the work, though — reporters are running from pit to pit
asking crew chiefs and team members for information. If a tire on a car goes
flat, for example, the pit reporter reports live from that driver’s pit, shows the
flat tire, and describes what has happened.
NASCAR races are covered differently from football or basketball games
because commentators can talk to the pit crews while the event is going on.
Sometimes the commentators even have negotiated with a driver to talk to
him via a radio during caution periods. You don’t see sideline reporters in
football interviewing the coach in the middle of the fourth quarter. And you
certainly don’t hear reporters chatting with the quarterback between plays.
Finding TV racing broadcasts
You can find NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and NASCAR Busch Series races on
NBC and FOX networks and their respective cable affiliates, TNT and FX. The
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and other NASCAR news and talk shows and
events such as qualifyings are shown on the Speed Channel. (Check your
local TV listings to track down a specific event.) The networks have different
commentators and pit reporters, but the overall coverage is informative and
interesting.
All races are scheduled for live broadcast. Occasionally, a weekend rainout,
with the race rescheduled for Monday, will then be shown on tape. Most
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series races are on Sunday afternoon, but a handful are
run on Saturdays or Saturday nights. It’s not like the old days in the early
1960s, when you could count on one hand the number of stock car races 
telecast in a year and those races were broadcast on ABC’s Wide World of
Sports a week or more after the event!
The NBC and FOX networks took over NASCAR broadcasts from several other
networks starting in 2001. FOX or FX broadcasts the first half of the season,
while NBC or TNT broadcast the second half. FOX and NBC alternate cover-
age of the Daytona 500.

Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Taking in the daily and weekly shows
If you can’t get enough NASCAR on weekends, plenty of networks have daily
and weekly NASCAR shows — so you can inundate yourself with information.
These shows give you breaking news, driver interviews, race reviews, techni-
cal information, and almost everything you’d ever want to know in a 30- to 
60-minute segment.
Here are some of the TV shows that feature NASCAR:
 NASCAR Performance on SPEED Channel: NASCAR Performance will
take on a new look in 2005 as it broadcasts from the track Saturday
nights. Crew chiefs (see Figure 15-1) are the centerpiece of this show,
giving their perspective on technical and automotive-related topics.
 NASCAR TV on SPEED Channel: The SPEED Channel offers a complete
slate of pre- and post-race shows, mid-week specials, and nightly pro-
gramming. SPEED’s NASCAR block also includes Trackside, NASCAR
Victory Lane, and Inside NEXTEL Cup, along with shows that feature the
history of the sport and day-to-day happenings on the track. SPEED also
airs a reality series (NBS 24-7) built around the NASCAR Busch Series.
SPEED Channel also airs event qualifying.
 Inside NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series Racing on Fox Sports: A commen-
tator and group of drivers talk about NASCAR racing every week, delving
into the previous race and news from the circuit.

Tuning In to Radio Broadcasts
Radio provides great play-by-play descriptions of races. In fact, they’re so
good that some people watch races on TV, but turn down the sound so that
they can listen to the radio broadcast instead. Radio reporters are every-
where on race day: above the track, in the pits, talking to crew chiefs and
crew members during the race, in the garage, and interviewing drivers that
have fallen out of the race, giving play-by-play commentary without missing a
beat. Radio reporters also work after the race, doing driver interviews after
television gets done with them.
When you’re listening to a race broadcast, you may have several network
options. To find out which radio station in your area carries the race, call
one of the following networks for a list of their affiliate stations:
 Motor Racing Network (MRN), a division of International Speedway
Corporation (ISC), is based in Daytona Beach. In addition to NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series races, MRN also carries the majority of NASCAR Busch
events and all NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races. MRN, which has
hundreds of affiliates in 48 states and Canada, reaches 150 countries
worldwide and many ships at sea on Armed Forces Radio. In addition,
MRN carries the NASCAR-related programs “NASCAR Today” and “NASCAR
Live.” For a complete schedule, write MRN, 1801 W. International
Speedway Blvd., Daytona Beach, FL 32114 or call 904-947-6400.
 Performance Racing Network (PRN) is based in Concord, North Carolina,
and is owned by Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI), the company that
also owns Lowe’s Motor Speedway, among other tracks hosting NASCAR
races. PRN broadcasts approximately a third of the season’s races, includ-
ing the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor Speedway, the Goody’s 500 at
Bristol Motor Speedway, and the Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway, among others. For information, write PRN, P.O. Box 600,
Concord, NC 28026-0600 or call 704-455-3228.
 The Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) Radio Network broadcasts all
races from Indianapolis Motor Speedway, including the Brickyard 400.
For information write 500 Brickyard Plaza, Indianapolis, IN 46222 or call
317-481-0060.
 NASCAR on XM Satellite Radio is the first and only 24-hour radio chan-
nel dedicated to a single sport. In 2005, NASCAR XM Radio added
another NASCAR channel. They both carry live coverage of NASCAR’s
three national series through MRN, PRN, and IMS. NASCAR XM Radio
also provides in-depth news coverage, interviews, talk shows, and other
original programming.
 NASCAR Performance LIVE Radio Show on XM Satellite Radio and
MRN. Originating from a special radio studio at the NASCAR Technical
Institute in Mooresville, North Carolina, NASCAR Performance Live delves
into the lives of the men and women who turn the wrenches and prepare
241
Chapter 15: Tracking NASCAR Events from the Comfort of Home

the greatest race cars in the world — NASCAR crews and crew chiefs.
Hosted by MRN pit road reporter Steve Post alongside former crew chief
and current color analyst for NASCAR on FOX, Larry McReynolds, the
program includes a rotating active crew chief in-studio to cover all the
day’s hot topics.
Following NASCAR in Print
Many newspapers and magazines cover NASCAR racing, but the depth of the
coverage varies. Some newspapers run stories on races and who won them.
Others run features throughout the week leading up to a race and report on
breaking news. Some magazines run a NASCAR story only once every three
weeks, while other magazines are entirely devoted to the sport.
If you want to purchase a newspaper or magazine that covers NASCAR regu-
larly, here are some you can choose from:
 Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Magazine is a yearly publication
highlighting the last ten races of the season. It provides driver bios on
the top ten drivers as well as race highlights for all races leading up to
the Chase.
 NASCAR Superstars is a magazine full of insight into the top personali-
ties in NASCAR NEXTEL Cup racing. This annual publication brings you
face-to-face with photos and stories on your favorite drivers.
 NASCAR Preview and Press Guide is a magazine that comes out once
a year, profiling drivers and providing statistics of drivers in every
NASCAR division. It also has a section devoted to NASCAR’s tracks.
 NASCAR Illustrated is a monthly magazine with features, commentary,
and profiles of people in NASCAR racing.
 NASCAR Scene is a weekly newspaper published in tabloid form, which
covers the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, the NASCAR Busch Series, and
the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and gives you features, race statis-
tics, and the NASCAR lowdown.
 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series Preview is an annual magazine published
at the beginning of the year. This publication highlights drivers as well
as races for the upcoming season.
 The NASCAR Review is also an annual publication. This magazine hits
shelves just in time for Christmas and features a run-down on the previ-
ous season. It highlights drivers, races, and the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series champion.

Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 

Staying in Touch with Your 
Favorite Driver
You can also keep tabs on your favorite driver through the Internet and 
fan clubs. You can find everything from a driver’s schedule to his statistics 
to where to purchase souvenirs. Many drivers also will autograph pictures 
or hats sent to him at his race shop. It’s all part of how fans stay close to
NASCAR drivers and how NASCAR drivers stay linked to their fans, even
though drivers travel to different racetracks — and sometimes different 
parts of the country — every weekend.
Surfing over to your favorite 
driver Web sites
It’s easy to keep up with your favorite driver if you have access to the
Internet. Most drivers have their own Web sites that are chock full of informa-
tion, so, if you hop onto a search engine such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) or
Google (www.google.com) and type in the driver’s name, you can easily find
the driver’s Web site if he has one. The sites have biographical information,
statistics, photographs, race schedules, and personal appearance schedules
(meaning you can find out where a driver will sign autographs and be there
to meet him).
Joining a driver fan club
If you can’t get enough of your favorite driver just by watching him race, then
you may want to join his fan club. Fan clubs are groups of people who ardently
support a driver and want to show that support by banding together. Member-
ship fees ranges from $8 to $25, depending on the driver and the perks you get
for being in the club. Most clubs provide you with an ID card, a signed postcard,
and a discount card to buy your driver’s souvenirs at the racetrack. Some even
send you a personalized card, signed by the driver, on your birthday and during
the holidays. Many clubs have meetings where fans can get together and dis-
cuss their driver or just talk shop.
If you’re doing an Internet search for a driver fan club, remember many of the
sites are unofficial. While those are fine to look up, keep in mind a driver’s
official site is the only one that will guarantee that the posted information is
correct. When you go to the Web site, it will say “official” somewhere on it,
meaning it’s the real one set up by a driver or his company. Your best option
is to contact a driver’s shop for information on his fan clubs and Internet sites.
243
Chapter 15: Tracking NASCAR Events from the Comfort of Home

Writing to the race shops
If you’d like to get a souvenir autographed by a driver or a crew member,
send it to his race shop with return postage. Usually, the race shop has a
room just for souvenirs, where a driver goes to sign all types of T-shirts, die-
cast cars, posters, and other trinkets. It may take them awhile to send your
souvenir back to you, maybe six months to a year if it’s Jeff Gordon or Dale
Earnhardt Jr., so don’t get impatient. They’re signing as fast as they can!
Here are addresses for some of the bigger race shops. Just address your

In this part . . .
T
his part gives you tidbits of information about some
of the greatest racers and the greatest races in
NASCAR — my unsolicited opinion on a few important
subjects. You find out who I think are NASCAR’s greatest
drivers and future stars, and which NASCAR races I think
are the best — from a fan’s standpoint of course. (This is
why I list superspeedway races, which most drivers dread.)
If you’re in a rush to digest as much NASCAR information
in the least amount of time, this part is the perfect place
to turn.

Chapter 16
The Greatest NASCAR Drivers 
of All Time
In This Chapter
 Reviewing my pick of NASCAR’s legendary drivers
 Looking at the stellar statistics of great drivers
M
any drivers win races, but only a few — those with special talent,
charisma, and personalities you just can’t forget — become legends.
These drivers have left an indelible mark on the sport of stock-car racing, and
while they may not be the drivers you cheer for, they are the ones who garner
your respect.
The list of greatest NASCAR drivers of all time can be argued until the end of
the next millennium, but here are the ones — in alphabetical order — that I
think are the best. Some have won championships. Some have won a lot of
races. Some have shown unparalleled determination. I’ve raced against a lot
of them, so I’ve gotten to know their driving styles and personalities firsthand.
Because of that, I’m convinced that they’re some of the best drivers ever.
Bobby Allison
In his 25 years of NASCAR Cup Series racing, Bobby Allison was fearless. And,
from time to time, he was reckless. But that in-your-face driving style and
unmistakable talent was the reason he was one of the most successful drivers
in NASCAR history. He won the 1983 NASCAR Cup Series championship and
84 races in his career, tying him with Darrell Waltrip for third on the all-time
wins list.
The most memorable moment of his career came when he won the 1988
Daytona 500 — his third Daytona 500 victory — and his son, the late Davey
Allison, finished second. The two celebrated together in Victory Lane, with
son proud of dad, and dad proud of son. Bobby retired in 1988, but still
attends many races.

250
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Dale Earnhardt
Ask any NASCAR driver, and they’ll tell you that Dale Earnhardt was the one
person they didn’t want to see in their rear-view mirrors, especially during the
final laps of a race. There’s a reason he was called the Intimidator, and it’s not
just that he didn’t always exude warmth. Earnhardt was the quintessential bully
on the racetrack, driving rough enough and fast enough to win 76 NASCAR
Cup races from 1975 through his final 2001 season (he died following an acci-
dent that year). That ranks the driver from rural North Carolina sixth on the 
all-time victories list. But the number of championships Earnhardt won over-
shadows his race victories: He won seven titles, tying him with Richard Petty
for the most NASCAR Cup championships in history. He also won more than
$41 million in his career, second only to Jeff Gordon’s $68 million on NASCAR’s
money list. While Earnhardt won on nearly every NASCAR track, his forte was
on superspeedways where, as legend has it, he could “see” air coming off the
cars around him and thus navigate through it better than anyone (see Chap-
ter 9 for more on this phenomenon). No matter on what type of track he raced,
Earnhardt’s sixth sense allowed him to make smart moves that helped him
thread through the field and stay up front once he got there.
Jeff Gordon
When Jeff Gordon came into NASCAR Cup Series racing in 1992, everybody
thought he was going to make it big and become the next greatest NASCAR
driver of the century. Everybody was right.
In 1995, Gordon clinched the first of his four NASCAR Cup Series champion-
ships, winning it when he was just 24 to become the youngest champion in
NASCAR’s modern era, dating from 1972. After his immediate success, Gordon
was quickly dubbed “Wonder Boy” and booed at nearly every track in the
series. Why? Perhaps because he won too much, too early. Perhaps because
he grew up in California and then moved to Indiana to race, so he wasn’t a
Southerner or a good ol’ boy like Earnhardt or Bill Elliott. Perhaps because
he seemed too goody-goody. Perhaps because he becomes more and more
unstoppable as the years go by. 
Gordon won back-to-back NASCAR Cup Series titles in 1997 and 1998, and in
1998 he won 13 races to tie Richard Petty’s modern-era record for victories in
a single season. In 2001, he won a personal-best $10.8 million in prize money
en route to the title. The scary part is, he’s not retiring any time soon and has
many more years to win races, break records, and clinch championships.
That’s good for his fans — bad for his competition. For all his success, Gordon
remains the target of boo-birds in the stands, which he says he has learned to
largely ignore. The one exception? Gordon is the overwhelming fan favorite in
the Brickyard 400, run at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he is consid-
ered a home-town racer.

Dale Jarrett
The son of two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett, it didn’t take
Dale long to step out from behind his father’s shadow and begin making a
name for himself. Signing on with (then) new team owner Joe Gibbs in 1993,
he and his team started the season with a bang, winning the Daytona 500.
Three years later, he captured his second Daytona 500 crown with team
owner Robert Yates, a feat they pulled off for the third time in 2000. Highly
thought of with both his race team and fans, Jarrett was a popular series
champion, winning the NASCAR Cup title in 1999. A gentleman on and off the
track, Jarrett and his wife, Kelley, are heavily involved in the sports endeavors
of his four children. He is also sought after as a golf partner in tournaments
sponsored by sponsors and tracks, as he is as talented on the links as he is
behind the wheel of a race car.
Alan Kulwicki
Even though Alan Kulwicki won only five NASCAR Cup Series races in his
career, he was good enough to win the 1992 NASCAR Cup championship.
And he made an impact on the sport that no statistics can measure. He was
one of the first competitors to treat the sport as a science. Kulwicki grew up
in Wisconsin, driving in the American Speed Association in the midwestern
United States before moving south to try his hand at NASCAR racing. But
Kulwicki was different than most drivers. He had a college degree in engineer-
ing and used the physics and math that he learned to set up his race car. At
first, people laughed when he showed up at races with a briefcase filled with
calculators — but now briefcases have become part of the mandatory gear for
crew chiefs and those who work on a car’s setup. Kulwicki was also determined
to field his own car and make it to the top the hard way without sponsorship.
He did just that, clinching the 1992 championship after winning only two races.
Kulwicki wasn’t able to defend his title, however, because he died in 1993 in a
plane crash.
David Pearson
No one wanted to mess with David Pearson when he was driving on the circuit.
He was just the kind of quiet, cool, confident guy you didn’t want to make
angry. People called him the “Silver Fox” because of his sly, cunning style.
Perhaps that’s why Pearson, who is retired from the sport, won 105 races in
his NASCAR Cup Series career. He ranks second on the all-time wins list.
Pearson was a versatile driver who did well on superspeedways, intermedi-
ate tracks, short tracks, and road courses. He won nearly everywhere, so
251
Chapter 16: The Greatest NASCAR Drivers of All Time

252
Part V: The Part of Tens 
much so that Richard Petty still insists Pearson is the best driver in NASCAR
history. Pearson won three NASCAR Cup Series championships — in 1966,
1968, and 1969, but continued to drive until 1986, when he retired. Even during
his final years as a racer, though, he was a daunting sight on the track for his
opponents. Not that he tried to be — that’s just the way he was. He made
racing and winning look easy.
Richard Petty
Richard Petty isn’t called stock-car racing’s king for nothing. He won a record
200 races in his 35-year career, nearly twice as many as anyone else. He also
won a record seven NASCAR Cup Series championships, tying him with Dale
Earnhardt for the series lead. He won a record seven Daytona 500s and a
shocking 27 of 49 races in 1967, including ten in a row. Petty retired from dri-
ving in 1992 and is now a NASCAR car owner.
Petty wasn’t just a successful driver. He was adored by the public and
became the sport’s unofficial public relations director, signing autographs
and posing for pictures for hours, selling stock-car racing — which started
out as a Southern sport — to mainstream America. When he won the 200th
race of his career, President Ronald Reagan just happened to be at the track
to congratulate him; their meeting made all the papers. With his trademark
cowboy hat, dark sunglasses, wide smile, and winning ways, it’s no wonder
Petty became a fan favorite and sports icon. He’s part of racing’s most famous
family — which began with his father, Lee Petty, who won three championships
and the inaugural Daytona 500, and has continued with his son, Kyle. It will
be nearly impossible for anyone to top what Petty did in the sport, what he
did for the sport, and what he continues to do. In an effort to give fans a first-
hand experience with the excitement that comes from driving a race car, he
opened the Richard Petty Driving Experience, a race school. (For more infor-
mation on driving schools, see Chapter 3.)
Rusty Wallace
In an age when most drivers just hop into their cars and head for the race-
track, Rusty Wallace is old-school. He still gets under the car to check things
out himself. He tells his crew chief exactly what to do with the car, going far
beyond just saying, “it’s loose” or “it’s tight.” This hands-on involvement is
what’s made him so good over the years. Wallace learned the ins and outs of
a race car growing up racing on short tracks in the Midwest, where he built
his own cars, raced his own cars, and repaired his own cars.

When he began his NASCAR Cup Series career in 1980, he took that knowledge
of cars with him — and translated it into stardom right away. In his first race
in the series that year in Atlanta, the bushy-headed redhead finished second
to Dale Earnhardt and immediately earned the respect of his competitors.
Now Wallace is one of the most successful and popular drivers in NASCAR
history. In addition to the 1989 NASCAR Cup Series championship, he has
won 55 races (through the 2004 season).
Darrell Waltrip
Darrell Waltrip energized NASCAR Cup Series racing from the moment he
started in 1972. Back then Waltrip was a fast-talker with a quick wit and not
a pinch of humility. His personality grew even more outrageous every time
he won a race. In fact, he earned the nickname “Jaws” for talking so much
and boasting about his accomplishments. Fans either loved or loathed him
because of his brashness. The thing is, Waltrip wasn’t totally out of line when
he bragged about himself — because he backed up his words with success
on the track. He won 84 races in his NASCAR Cup career, which ties him for
third all-time. He also won three series championships.
Waltrip has mellowed over the years, but he still loves to gab and trash-talk,
good qualities for a driver-turned-television commentator. Behind the micro-
phone since retiring from driving in 2000, Waltrip has become as successful
and entertaining a commentator as he was a driver.
Cale Yarborough
A three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion, Cale Yarborough never thought
twice about pushing himself or his cars to the limit, especially when he was
teamed with legendary car owner Junior Johnson — who didn’t have any limits
himself. Yarborough, who retired as a driver in 1988, was a spitfire even before
getting into a race car, claiming to have wrestled snakes and alligators — and
even insisting he got hit by lightning when he was young. Yarborough won
83 races to put himself fifth on NASCAR’s all-time wins list. That includes four
Daytona 500s, which he won in 1968, 1977, 1983, and 1984. For a while, though,
Yarborough defected from the stock-car ranks to go Indy-car racing. He raced
Indy cars in 1971 and 1972, and then headed back to what he knew best. And
that was winning NASCAR races.

Ten Can’t-Miss Races of the Year
In This Chapter
 Listing the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series races that you can’t miss
 Finding out why certain races are so special
E
ven though you may want to see every NASCAR race, it’s okay to admit
you don’t have the time or the means to watch 36 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series races each year. Because you probably can’t catch them all, however,
this chapter outlines some of the most exciting, hair-raising, or historically
important races that every self-respecting NASCAR fan should see at least
once.
Fans and drivers all have their own favorite races, but these are some of the
ones on everybody’s list. Sure, it’s all subjective, but these races consistently
provide action. Check out Chapter 13 for a full description of each track.
Daytona 500
The Daytona 500, held in February at the Daytona International Speedway,
is NASCAR’s Super Bowl — the most revered and most heralded race of the
year. Some of the most famous drivers have won it, including Richard Petty
(seven times!), Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough, and even Indy car legends
Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt. Unlike the Super Bowl, though, the Daytona 500
is the season-opener, which is what makes it so special. Teams spend almost
the entire off-season preparing for this one race and come to Daytona in
February hoping to win that year’s championship. If you have a good finish in
the Daytona 500, it sets the tone for your entire season; so emotions — and
speeds — run high throughout the afternoon.
Watching the Daytona 500 not only gives you high speeds and plenty of
thrills, but it also gives you a preview of who may race strong during the
upcoming season.

Coca-Cola 600
The Coca-Cola 600, formerly known as the World 600, is held the Sunday
before Memorial Day at Lowe’s Motor Speedway north of Charlotte, North
Carolina, and is NASCAR’s longest event. With 600 miles of racing, it’s
NASCAR’s version of a marathon, so fans have to be tenacious to watch the
entire race. The race starts in late afternoon and isn’t finished until well after
dark, so drivers and teams have to face constantly changing track conditions.
The extra 100 miles also puts extraordinary strain on the engines. Drivers,
crews, and cars are tested in this endurance race where only the competitors
with the most stamina and the cars with the sturdiest parts finish up front.
Pepsi 400 at Daytona 
Races at superspeedways are naturally fun to watch because the cars run so
fast and so close together. What makes them even more fun is when a race is
held at night under the lights at Daytona International Speedway. The Pepsi
400, formerly called the Firecracker 400, is held the Saturday of the Fourth of
July weekend. It was moved from daytime to night in 1998 after track officials
spent $5 million to install lights around the 2.5-mile superspeedway. Not only
is the race cooler to watch for spectators because it’s no longer held in the
sweltering midday heat of Central Florida in July — but it’s also one of the
year’s most heart-pounding and spectacular events. To top that, the post-
race fireworks show is awesome.
Brickyard 400
Indy car purists said hell would freeze over before stock cars raced at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the legendary home of the Indianapolis 500.
Well, it froze over for good reason. The Brickyard 400, held in the beginning
of August, is one of the year’s most interesting NASCAR races. With a hefty
paycheck at stake for the winner, drivers take chances to get to the front.
NASCAR only goes to the 2.5-mile Brickyard once a year, which makes the
event all that more special. But every time a stock-car driver goes to Victory
Lane at the storied track, he makes history. Stock cars made their debut
there in 1994, when Jeff Gordon won the inaugural event. Since then, the
Brickyard 400 has been one of the best tickets in racing.
256
Part V: The Part of Tens 

257
Chapter 17: Ten Can’t-Miss Races of the Year
Sharpie 500
If you want to guarantee yourself a good time, watch the night race at Bristol
Motor Speedway, held every August. What could be better than 43 cars cir-
cling a tiny, high-banked, half-mile track and bumping into each other the
whole way? See all that at night — when sparks fly and tempers flare at the
track tucked into the mountains of eastern Tennessee.
Actually, both races at Bristol, even the one held during the day in April, are
must-sees, but the night race is absolutely electric — as well as action-packed.
EA Sports 500 
NASCAR has two superspeedways where cars run in packs only inches apart —
the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama and the 2.5-mile Daytona
International Speedway in Florida. Of those two, Talladega is bigger and faster.
Both races at Talladega are sensational to watch: the Aaron’s 499 is held in April
and the EA Sports 500 in the fall. By the fall race, the race for the championship
may be hot — and the title chase may close up at the super-big, super-daunting
track. As a fan, you can’t see the entire racetrack no matter where you sit in the
grandstands, but seeing the swarm of cars coming off one of the turns is jaw-
dropping. They race two-, three-, four-, and even five-wide at times, and you
may wonder how they do it.
Chevy Monte Carlo 400
Races at Richmond International Raceway have long been fan-favorites fea-
turing drivers racing side by side, door handle to door handle, all the way
around the track, lap after lap. But the Chevy Monte Carlo 400 at the .75-mile
Virginia track is now a must-attend race because it’s now the last chance
for drivers to make the final cut for the Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup.
Following that race, only drivers in the top-10 in the points standings, or those
within 400 points of the leader, remain (with 10 races to go) as championship
contenders.

The NASCAR NEXTEL All-Star Challenge
Even though the All-Star Challenge doesn’t count toward the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series championship, it still should be one of the races you see — even
if it’s just for the novelty. It’s held a week before the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s
Motor Speedway in May, but it’s not at all like a normal NASCAR race. In fact,
few of the real rules count. The race is primarily for winners from the previ-
ous and current NASCAR Cup seasons. It also invites any past NASCAR Cup
Champions who haven’t qualified via a race victory, plus the winner of the
NEXTEL Open, a preliminary event for teams that have not qualified for
the showcase event. Two other past champions — who are also still active
drivers — are eligible; previously, there was a five-year retroactive cut-off
for past champions. While the 90-lap/135-mile overall distance is divided
into 40-, 30-, and 20-lap segments, drivers are no longer eliminated after each
segment, ensuring that a full field of cars is racing for the winner’s purse of
approximately $1 million.
Mountain Dew Southern 500
Darlington Raceway is NASCAR’s first superspeedway — it opened in 1950 —
and the Mountain Dew Southern 500 is one of NASCAR’s most prized races.
But winning the classic and becoming a part of Darlington history isn’t an
easy task. Darlington is arguably the most unique and challenging track in
NASCAR racing. Its walls seem to jump out and attack cars as the vehicles
zoom through the corners. The rough racing surface chews up tires in a
blink. So you can see why only the bravest, most skillful drivers make it to
Victory Lane at the South Carolina track.
Cale Yarborough and Jeff Gordon have the record for most Southern 500 wins
with five — but Bobby Allison isn’t far behind with four. That alone puts these
drivers a notch above other drivers in the history book. Watching drivers as
talented as those navigating this tricky track is worth the price of admission.
Ford 400
What makes the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway a don’t-miss race is
that it’s the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series season finale. If it’s a close race for
the championship, the race may be a nail-biter for drivers and teams who are
in the running for the title — as well as for their fans. At least the Florida sun-
shine helps. With the new Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Championship,
fans have a better chance than ever to see the actual crowning of the series
champion.

Dodge Save Mart 350
Having made hard left turns the first half of the season, the majority of
NASCAR’s drivers look forward to the season’s first road-course test, which
comes in June at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. Half of the 11 turns
spread over the winding 1.95-mile course just outside San Francisco are to
the right — a direction drivers generally avoid on ovals as they usually mean
a trip into the wall. While some drivers struggle on road courses (Infineon
Raceway and Watkins Glen in northern New York are the series’ only two
tracks with twists and turns), others enjoy non-oval racing, including four-
time event champion Jeff Gordon. Other drivers with victories at Infineon
Raceway include two-time winner Rusty Wallace, Ricky Rudd, Tony Stewart,
and Mark Martin. For fans interested in making a “road trip,” the Dodge Save
Mart 350 race at Infineon Raceway is the place to be.

In This Chapter
 Taking a look at the new crop of driving talent
 Reviewing the prospects of NASCAR’s youngest drivers
E
ven though some of NASCAR’s most famous drivers — including NASCAR
NEXTEL Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace — are nearing the end of
their careers, NASCAR won’t lack superstars in the new millennium. Look for
a new crop of talented racers to inject youth, energy, and pizzazz into NASCAR
in the coming years.
Greg Biffle
Washington State isn’t exactly a hotbed of NASCAR racing, but Greg Biffle has
proven the Northwest can produce talented and determined drivers. Just like
many other NASCAR Cup drivers, Biffle started out racing on short tracks,
but unlike others, he captured the 1996 Pacific Coast Region championship
by winning a whopping 27 times in 47 starts — 57 percent of the time! After
dominating like that, Biffle was hired by team owner Jack Roush (who has an
impeccable eye for talent) to drive in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series; he
was that series’ top rookie in 1998. He went on to win nine races and compete
for the Craftsman Truck series championship the following year, eventually
finishing third in the point standings. Biffle made his first trip to NASCAR Cup’s
victory lane in the 2003 Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway. Not
bad for a guy who runs a fabricating business in his hometown of Vancouver,
Washington, in his spare time. 
Kurt Busch
Every sport needs its bad boy, and NASCAR has Kurt Busch. That’s not to say
he isn’t a nice fellow. He’s just more concerned with driving his race car than
setting himself up as the sport’s paragon of etiquette, especially at the short
tracks. A native of Las Vegas, Busch ended the 2003 season on a tear and

proved to be a driver to watch in 2004. Busch makes no apologies for the fact
he comes to the track to race; he’s there for the dance, not the buffet. Fans
get their money’s worth every time the No. 97 Ford driver straps himself in.
Dale Earnhardt Jr.
On the track, there’s no doubt Dale Earnhardt Jr. is similar to his father and
namesake, seven-time NASCAR Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. The two are
winners — both confident, aggressive drivers who know how to get to the
front. Earnhardt Jr.’s grandfather, Ralph, was a NASCAR Late Model
Sportsman (now the NASCAR Busch Series) champion in 1956. Still, no one
expected Earnhardt Jr. to wow the racing world when he ran his first full
season in the NASCAR Busch Series in 1998 when he was 24. 
But he proved everyone wrong by winning the Busch Series championship —
and seven races — that season and winning the title again in 1999. Earnhardt Jr.
described his 2003 season as the foundation for a NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
championship and by all accounts is perfectly poised to make that dream a
reality.
Jimmie Johnson
The runner-up to Matt Kenseth in the 2003 NASCAR Cup Series championship,
Johnson was the only driver to stay in the top 10 in the points through all 36
races of the season. Think this Jeff Gordon teammate has the goods to eventu-
ally reach the top? Absolutely. He is a threat to win everywhere the Rick
Hendrick Motorsports No. 48 team unloads. Hendrick is a strong believer in
what he calls the “fit factor,” the compatibility among the people in his organi-
zation. Johnson has a strong supporting cast behind him; most notably crew
chief Chad Knaus. And who could ask for a better mentor than teammate and
co-owner Gordon?
Kasey Kahne
As if driving the No. 9 Dodge isn’t enough, this Washington State native even
looks a bit like his cockpit predecessor, NASCAR Cup Series champion Bill
Elliott. Hooking up with Dodge team owner Ray Evernham has been a dream
come true for Kahne, who out of the box in 2004 won pole positions and
racked up an impressive string of runner-up finishes. Making things even
262
Part V: The Part of Tens 

better, Kahne has become the retired Elliott’s star pupil and can also rely on
teammate Jeremy Mayfield for advice. Kahne is just one of the latest new tal-
ents to benefit from the trend among car owners to gravitate toward young
drivers in an effort to get a leg up on future competition.
Jeremy Mayfield
When rumors ran rampant in the new millennium that his job was in jeop-
ardy, Jeremy Mayfield knew how to respond to his critics: with his heavy
right foot. Like a sleeping giant stirred, the Owensboro, Kentucky, native put
the hammer down, driving Ray Evernham’s Dodge into the wonderful world
of job security. A middle of the road driver for 18 months, Mayfield literally
raced the last five months of 2003 as if his career were on the line — which it
was. He didn’t make it to victory lane, but he placed among the top-10 in 11
of the final 21 races on the schedule, highlighted by two runner-up and two
third-place finishes in the final 11. 
Mayfield’s turnaround was so dramatic that several other car owners came
courting, but he felt they had finally turned the corner. Teamed with NASCAR
Cup rookie Kasey Kahne in 2004, Mayfield took a back seat in racing headlines,
as Kahne quickly registered four pole positions and four runner-up finishes.
But when the 2004 championship field was reduced to 10 drivers with 10 races
remaining, it was Mayfield, not Kahne, who had made the cut.
Jamie McMurray
Who is the only driver in NASCAR Cup Series history to win a race the season
before he was named series rookie of the year? Jamie McMurray, who rocked
the racing world in 2002 when he won a race in only his second NASCAR Cup
career start while substituting for injured teammate Sterling Marlin. In 2003,
McMurray earned top rookie honors on the strength of being the highest-
finishing freshman driver 21 times, 12 more than runner-up Greg Biffle. 
McMurray’s season was the most productive for team owner Chip Ganassi’s
three-car operation; he led the organization with 5 top-five finishes and 13
top-10 finishes. The young speedster threatened to win the Brickyard 400 and
scored his first pole position at Homestead, Florida. McMurray, a notable
cutup when goofing with Marlin, exhibits poise and confidence on the track
and is notable for not tangling with his fellow drivers at speeds in excess of
170 miles per hour.

Chapter 18: NASCAR’s Young Stars

Ryan Newman
This Roger Penske pilot has been on everyone’s list to win a NASCAR Cup
championship since being crowned the 2002 Raybestos Rookie of the Year as
the sport’s top-performing first-year driver. What’s held him back? He hasn’t
finished a lot of his races because of mechanical failure or accidents. A cham-
pionship contender in 2004, the Indiana native is brutally quick and gets
arguably the best fuel mileage on the circuit with his Dodge. The Newman-
Penske pairing could be the one that matches the feat of teammate Rusty
Wallace, NASCAR’s Cup champion in 1989. Newman was a man on fire in 2003,
leading the series with 8 victories, 11 pole wins, and the most miles led with
1,509, but his inability to finish races left him sixth in the NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series standings.
Elliott Sadler
You won’t find a more likeable guy in the NASCAR garage than Elliott Sadler.
But just because Sadler walks around with a smile while humming his favorite
country tunes doesn’t mean he’s not serious about racing. While Tony Stewart
overshadowed him in their quests for a rookie of the year title in 1999, Sadler
had a solid first year in the NASCAR Cup Series. He wasn’t at all discouraged
by Stewart’s unusually stellar rookie performance — and it’s that positive
attitude that will help him in racing, where seasons can be as unpredictable
as a derailed roller coaster.
He developed that upbeat demeanor while growing up in Emporia, Virginia, a
rural town not far from South Boston Speedway (the same speedway where
NASCAR Cup racers Ward and Jeff Burton first made their names in the
sport). Sadler won the 1995 Late Model Stock championship at that track
before making his NASCAR Busch Series debut there that same year. He was
only 21. Just two years later, he found himself in the NASCAR Cup Series
racing for the legendary Wood Brothers before jumping to Robert Yates
Racing in 2003.
Tony Stewart
Winner of the 2002 NASCAR Cup Series championship, Tony Stewart doesn’t
exactly fit the mold of an up-and-coming star: He already is one. Unlike some
other drivers, however, Stewart is considered a good bet to win a second,
third, and even fourth Cup title, which puts him in the category of superstar
of the future. By all accounts, Stewart made the right decision when he
264
Part V: The Part of Tens 

moved from open-wheel Indy Cars to stock cars. Crowned the 1997 (open-
wheel) Indy Racing League champion, Stewart had always wanted to race
in NASCAR, so he packed up and headed for NASCAR Cup Series racing full-
time in 1999. That’s when he made history, becoming the first rookie to win a
NASCAR Cup race since the late Davey Allison did so in 1987. 
Stewart also finished the season as one of only three rookies in NASCAR 
history to finish in the top five in points (finishing fourth) and the first rookie
to do so since 1996. Although a humble NASCAR Cup Series rookie, Stewart
didn’t hide his fiery personality on or off the track — which has made him
one of the sport’s most popular drivers. He has repeatedly shown his passion
for racing in any form by driving in both the Indianapolis 500 (Indy Car race)
and NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 on the same day each May. His competitiveness
and dedication ensure Stewart is a force to be reckoned with, no matter in
which series he chooses to race.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
P
art of the fun of getting into a new sport and the fun
of being an old hand is knowing all those statistics
that make you seem so smart. In this part, I give you all the
best NASCAR jargon, statistics, and key milestones that
you need.

Appendix A
NASCAR Jargon
Aerodynamics
Race car aerodynamics refers to how the air flows over the surfaces and under
the body of a car. It also includes the wake of turbulent air left behind a car as
it travels.
A-Frame
Either the upper or lower connecting suspension piece (shaped like an A)
that locks the frame to the spindle.
Air dam
An air dam is an extension below the front bumper that blocks air as it hits
the front of a car, keeping too much air from flowing under the vehicle and
reducing the car’s speed and stability. It plays a big role in the aerodynamics
of a car by keeping the front end stable.
Appearance
When a driver makes an appearance, he shows up to sign posters, programs,
and trading cards for fans or employees at supermarket grand openings, auto
shows, conventions, car dealerships, fairgrounds, and auto stores.
Apron
The paved portion of a racetrack that separates the racing surface from the
infield.
Associate sponsor
Associate sponsors are companies that sponsor racing teams. They pay less
money and, in turn, get less exposure on the car or the uniform than the pri-
mary sponsors do.
Autograph card
An autograph card is a sheet of heavy-duty paper with a driver’s picture on
the front and his vital statistics on the back. They are free for fans and used
for souvenirs and for autographs.

270
Part VI: Appendixes 
Backstretch
The straight section of the track located on the side of the track opposite the
start/finish line. On an oval track, it’s between the second and third turns.
Banking
The sloping of a racetrack, particularly at a curve or corner, from the apron
to the outside wall. Degree of banking refers to the angle or steepness of a
track’s slope at its outside edge.
Battling for position
When two cars are racing each other for the same spot in the field — whether
1st place or 20th.
Being on the lead lap
When a driver has completed the same number of laps as the leader.
Bite
See wedge.
Blocking
When a driver positions his car to keep the driver behind him from passing him.
Blowing an engine
When a driver suffers engine failure beyond immediate repair and can’t finish
the race. Engines blow when their connecting rods or pistons break or when
the engine block cracks, among other reasons.
Camber
The amount that a tire is tilted from vertical so that more of the tire surface
can touch more of the racing surface in a banked turn.
Car chief
Team mechanic who works most closely with the crew chief in figuring out
setups for the car. He directs the rest of the car crew, who physically make
the changes (although car chiefs also often do hands-on work, too).
Carburetor
The device above the engine where air and fuel mix on their way into an
internal combustion engine.

271
Appendix A: NASCAR Jargon
Carburetor restrictor plate
A thin metal plate with four holes that restrict the flow of air into an engine’s
carburetor, thus reducing horsepower and speed. Used only at Daytona and
Talladega — NASCAR’s two superspeedways — to keep speeds below 200 mph.
Catch can man
During pit stops, the catch can man stands behind the car on the left side and
holds a special container at the end of the car to collect gas that overflows
from the gas tank after it’s filled.
Caution flag
A yellow flag waved by the flagman in the starter’s stand to indicate trouble
on the racetrack, including oil or debris on the racing surface. It signals dri-
vers to slow down and follow the pace car around the track.
Champion’s provisional
The champion’s provisional is the last or 43rd starting spot given out for a
race. Former series champions are eligible to use this if they don’t make the
race based on their qualifying speed. See also provisional entry.
Chassis
The steel frame or undercarriage of a car.
Chassis dynamometer
A machine that measures the amount of power translated from the wheels to
the ground.
Competition Performance Index (CPI)
A formula that evaluates driver performance in the NASCAR Dodge Weekly
Series, including average finish, number of wins, driver attendance, and the
average number of cars in the field.
Compression ratio
The volume of a cylinder compared to the its compressed volume when 
the piston is fully extended. The higher the compression ratio, the more
horsepower.
Contingency programs
Bonus money given by companies whose products a driver uses or whose
decals a driver runs on his car.

272
Part VI: Appendixes 
C-Post
The post extending from the roofline of a race car to the base of the rear
window to the top of the deck lid.
Crew chief
A crew chief is the leader of the race team who oversees employees and han-
dles the building and fine-tuning of a race car. He’s responsible for deciding
which changes to make to the race car throughout race weekend and what
race strategies to use on race day.
Deck lid
The rear trunk lid of a race car. It opens like the trunk lid of a passenger car
and allows access to the fuel cell.
Displacement
The size of an engine measured in cubic inches. A NASCAR NEXTEL Cup
Series car’s engine can’t be larger than 358 cubic inches.
Donuts
Slang term for the black, circular, dent-like marks on the side panels of stock
cars, usually caused after rubbing against other cars at high speed.
Downforce
The air pressure and downward force that pushes a car onto the track, caus-
ing it to stick to the racing surface. It keeps cars from losing traction at high
speeds, especially going through the turns.
Drafting
When drivers race in single file on large speedways and share air flow
among their cars. Cars cut through the air much faster together than they
do separately — the first car creates a vacuum effect that actually pulls the
car behind it.
Drag
Drag is the aerodynamic force of resistance that hinders a race car as it
moves through air. It’s caused by air flowing beneath the car and lifting it
higher in the air, as well as air flowing through the cooling system, ducts in
the body, and open windows. Air travels into these openings instead of
smoothly sliding over the car. With less drag, a car can accelerate faster,
especially at higher speeds, because the car needs less horsepower to move
forward through the air.

273
Appendix A: NASCAR Jargon
Engine builder
Team member in charge of building engines and coaching people to build
engines nearly from scratch. His goal is to make each engine as lightweight —
but still as durable — as possible. The engine builder is in charge of the engine
assemblers, who actually put the engine together.
Engine specialist
Team member in charge of preparing the engines at the race shop and then
taking care of and tuning them after they get to the racetrack. Also called
engine tuner.

course, one turn immediately following another.
Fabricator
Team member who puts sheet metal on the car’s frame and molds it to the
shape of the car, creating the body or outside shell of the car.
Five-point seat belts
Five belts that come together at the center of a driver’s chest. Each of the
belts passes through a steel guide that is welded onto the car’s frame: one
belt goes over a driver’s left shoulder, one goes over his right shoulder,
another comes from the left side of the seat, one comes from the right side
of the seat, and still another goes between a driver’s legs. They’re all latched
together at a single point with a quick-release buckle.
Flagman
The NASCAR official perched over the racetrack, just above the start/finish
line. The flagman signals to the drivers by waving different-colored flags that
mean different things.
Flags
 Green: The race is started.
 Yellow: Caution — all drivers must slow down.
 Red: All drivers must stop.
 Black: The driver at whom the black flag is waved must get off the track.
 White: The lead car has one lap to go.
 Blue with diagonal yellow stripe: Signals a slow driver to move over.
 Green-white-checkered sequence: Used near the end of the race in an
attempt to keep it from finishing under caution. Can add as many as two
laps to the length of the race.
 Checkered: The winning car has crossed the finish line.

274
Part VI: Appendixes 
Frontstretch
The straight section of racetrack between the first and last turns.
Fuel cell
A rectangular rubber holding tank for a race car’s supply of gasoline. A
NASCAR fuel cell holds 22 gallons.
Garage pass
A permit that lets someone into the garage area during a race weekend,
obtained through the racetrack or through NASCAR and reserved for people
who know someone who works in the sport (at the racetrack, as a sponsor,
on a team, and so on). Also called a pit pass.
Gas-and-go
A quick pit stop where a car gets only gas — but no new tires.
Gas man
Pit crew member who steps over the pit wall carrying a 90-pound, 11-gallon
can of gas and fills the gas tank. When the first can empties, he usually gets
a second can from the second gas man (who doesn’t go over the wall) and
finishes filling the tank.
General mechanics
Crew members who help the car chief set up the car, build shocks back in the
trailer, rework the body of a car after a driver crashes it into the wall, and so
on. They’re not specialized.
Getting hung out to dry
Racing slang that means a driver has lost the draft and is losing positions by
the split second. To remedy the situation, the driver must get back in line with
other cars where the aerodynamics are much more conducive to going fast.
Going behind the wall
When a car is too damaged to be repaired on pit road, the team brings it to
the garage behind the pit wall.
Handling
How a car responds on the track. A car’s handling is determined by how it was
built (including its suspension, tires, aerodynamics, and body style) and how
it’s prepared for the race.

275
Appendix A: NASCAR Jargon
Hanging a body
Sizing sheet metal, cutting sheet metal, and then molding it onto a car’s frame
to form the shell of a car.
Happy Hour
The final hour of practice before an event, usually held in the late afternoon
the day before the race.
Hat dance
When a race winner puts on dozens of baseball caps with sponsors logos in
Victory Lane. Each time a driver puts the cap on, the photographers snap
photos to send or sell to the sponsor involved.
Head protectors
Protection built into a driver’s seat to keep his head from moving to the left
or right during an accident.
Hitting points
When a driver talks about “hitting his points” or “hitting his marks” on the
racetrack, he’s referring to being able to drive the fastest route around
the track that he has mapped out in his head. Usually, a driver will record in
his mind various small marks or other points of reference around the track,
especially entering and exiting the turns, and then will try to visually hit
those spots each time around the track. 
Horsepower
A unit of measurement representing how much power an engine generates.
Hospitality
Pre-race gathering that drivers hold with a group of employees or guests
from one of their sponsors.
Inspections
The process NASCAR officials go through to approve cars to race, qualify, and
practice.
Intermediate track
Tracks more than one mile long but less than two miles. See also short track,
superspeedway.

276
Part VI: Appendixes 
Jackman
Pit crew member who positions the jack under a specific spot on each side of
the car, pumps the handle of the jack one or two times so that it lifts the car
off the ground enough for the tire changers to change the tires, and then drops
the jack and lowers the car.
Lapped traffic
Cars that aren’t on the lead lap. These cars are usually considerably slower
than the leaders.
Licensee
The licensee is the person or entity who sells NASCAR goods and must pay
royalty payments to the licensor (who gives the rights to sell the goods) at
pre-arranged times.
Licensor
The licensor is the person or entity who gives the rights to sell NASCAR or
race team goods, receiving royalty payments from the licensee (who sells the
goods) in return.
Loose
A car is termed loose when a driver goes through a turn and the rear of his
car starts to fishtail, making the driver feel as if he’s losing control of the car
and about to spin out. The rear tires aren’t sticking well to the track and pro-
viding enough traction. This is also called oversteer. See also tight.
Lug nuts
Large nuts that secure tires in place. All NASCAR cars use five lug nuts on
each wheel, and penalties are assessed if a team fails to put on all five during
a pit stop.
Modern era
Period in NASCAR history that began in 1972, when a new points system and
a radically streamlined schedule were introduced. 
MPH
Miles per hour.

begin their professional racing careers. Drivers train themselves and hone
their driving skills before moving up to NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. 
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series is the newest of the three national NASCAR
touring series, in its 11th season of existence featuring four different manufac-
tured field trucks, all based upon the popular, half-ton short bed models.
NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series
The top series of NASCAR.
One-groove racetrack
A racetrack that has just one route around it where cars can stick to the track
and handle well. If a driver gets out of that path, he may not get enough grip to
keep his car stable — and that means he could end up in the wall. Some tracks
have more than one groove — a high groove and a low groove — meaning cars
can run side-by-side around the track. Some tracks have no particular groove
because cars race easily on any part of the track.
Over-the-wall guys
See pit crew.
Owner
The owner of the entire racing team. He or she has a financial stake in the
race team and therefore has final say in hiring everyone who works on the
team, from the driver to the crew chief to everyone who prepares the cars
for racing. The owner must also secure a sponsor to help pay the bills.
Paint scheme
The way a car is painted and decorated.
Panhard bar

pit stop. See also over-the-wall guys.
Pit pass
See garage pass.
Pit road
A separate road inside a racetrack that usually runs parallel to a track’s
frontstretch. It’s where cars go when they need gas, tires, or repairs.
Pit stall
Where teams watch the race and keep their equipment — separated from the
pit box by the pit wall.
Pit stop
When a car pulls off the racetrack and travels down pit road where his crew
services his car.
Pit wall
The cement wall separating the pit box from the pit stalls.
Pit window
An estimate of the range of laps the crew thinks the driver can go before
needing to make a pit stop to refuel.
Pole winner (pole sitter)
Driver who records the fastest lap during qualifying and is rewarded by start-
ing the race from the inside (closest to the grass) of the two-car front row.
The outside pole winner is the driver who had the second-fastest lap during
qualifying. He starts the race from the outside of the front row.
Primary sponsor
A company or entity that pays the most money to a team. Primary sponsors
get their decals on the car hoods, which is the best place to advertise because
fans see them so well.

279
Appendix A: NASCAR Jargon
Provisional entry
Guaranteed spot in a race given to regular series drivers who qualify poorly
during the weekend but who are high enough in points. See also champion’s
provisional.
Quad ovals
A modified oval racetrack with two extra slight turns entering both the
frontstretch and backstretch.
Radio frequency scanner
See scanner.
Real money
The money that a team actually gets after winning a race. Most teams aren’t
eligible for all the award money because they aren’t affiliated with all the
companies that provide financial awards to the race winner.
Rear spoiler
Metal blade that runs the width of the car atop the back of its trunk. It regu-
lates air as it flows over a car and helps push the back end of the car into the
track, which gives the car more traction and better handling.
Relief driver
A driver who replaces the original driver because of an injury or illness.
Restart
The waving of the green flag following a caution period.
Right off the truck
A driver usually says his car was great “right off the truck” when his car runs
well in the first practice without any tweaking.
Road courses
Racetracks with complex configurations of left and right turns at varying
angles. The track may have elevation changes as well. Infineon Raceway and
Watkins Glen International are the only two NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series road
courses.
Roll bars
The part of the car’s frame that protects the driver because it’s made of strong
steel tubing with a standardized thickness.

280
Part VI: Appendixes 
Roll cage
The protective frame of steel surrounding a driver. It keeps the driver safe
during an accident because it protects him from the impact of another car
or of a wall if the car flips over. The roll cage consists of roll bars made from
steel tubing.
Roof flaps
Rectangular pieces of metal attached to the roof of a car that lie flat when the
car is moving forward, but pop into the air when a car spins backwards or
sideways, helping to keep a car from becoming airborne.
Rookie of the year
NASCAR awards rookie of the year honors to the first-year driver whose best
15 finishes are higher than any other first-year driver.
Rounds of wedge
Putting rounds of wedge into a car means a crew member is adjusting the
handling by changing the pressure on the rear springs.
RPM
Short for revolutions per minute, a measurement of how fast an engine is
turning and how hard it’s working. See also tachometer.
Rubber
A piece of rubber placed between the coils of a spring to increase tension
and taken out to decrease tension. This changes how a car handles.
Running wide open

Hydraulic cylinders attached to the car’s wheels that make the car ride more
smoothly over bumps.
Shock dynamometer
Machine that pumps the shock absorber up and down, feeding information to
the team’s computer.
Short track
Racetracks shorter than one mile in length, where aerodynamics and horse-
power aren’t particularly important in winning the race. Bristol Motor
Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, and Richmond International Raceway are
the three NASCAR short tracks. See also intermediate track, superspeedway.
Show car
Former real race car that was taken out of the rotation for being too old, suf-
fering irreparable damage, or just not being suited to the driver.
Show-car driver
A driver whose job is to drive a show car all over the country, bringing the
car to stores, fairs, and driver appearances.
Silly season
Slang for a rumor-filled period that begins during the latter part of the cur-
rent season, wherein some teams contemplate or announce driver, crew,
and/or sponsor changes for the following year.
Slick
A track condition where, for a number of reasons, it’s hard for a car’s tires to
adhere to the surface. A slick racetrack is not necessarily wet or slippery
because of oil or water.
Slingshot
A maneuver in which a car following the leader in a draft suddenly steers
around it, breaking the vacuum and providing an extra burst of speed that
allows the second car to take the lead.
Spoiler
See rear spoiler.

282
Part VI: Appendixes 
Sponsors
The companies that pay for the right to have their names on cars and team
uniforms. See also primary sponsors and associate sponsors. 
Spotter

box. His job is to be the driver’s second set of eyes, telling the driver where
to go on the racetrack to avoid an accident or when to pass another car.
Sticker tires
New tires that still have the manufacturer’s sticker on them. See also scuffs.
Stop-and-go penalty
When a driver must come down pit road, stop in his pit box for a moment,
and then drive down pit road to the racetrack.
Superspeedway
A racetrack of a mile or more in distance.
Suspension
The system of springs, shock absorbers, sway bars, and so on, directly con-
nected to the wheels or the axles, which affects the handling of a race car.
Sway bars
Alter the amount a car rolls to one side or the other through the turns.
Tachometer
The instrument used to measure the number of revolutions per minute.
Drivers use it to determine how fast they are going. See also rpm.
Taking air off a spoiler
Instead of the air flowing onto the lead car’s spoiler and pressing the car’s
rear-end into the track, it flows off the spoiler and onto the second car’s front
end. That leaves the lead car with little rear-end downforce and causes it to
become unstable and wiggle out of control, especially going through turns.
See also rear spoiler.
Taping a car off
A crew places tape over the radiator grille of the car in order to keep air from
entering the radiator and slowing the car down. Done to improve aerodynam-
ics, but only during qualifying because the engine would overheat and fail if
taped off during a race.

283
Appendix A: NASCAR Jargon
Team hauler
A large semi truck where the team hangs out when they’re not working on
their car. It’s a place to eat and hold meetings at the racetrack — some even
take naps in the forward lounge.
Team manager
Team member who serves as the owner’s representative in the shop, oversee-
ing everything including ordering equipment, hiring personnel, and organizing
test sessions.
Tearing down
When cars are torn down, teams take apart the engines and whatever else
NASCAR officials want them to. The winning team goes through a thorough
tear down, meaning it takes apart the engine, the suspension, the power
train, or whatever else officials want to check out.
Tech
NASCAR lingo for technical inspection. See also inspection.
Telemetry
Telemetry is a series of sensors attached to various parts of the car that
transmit information such as miles per hour, engine revolutions per minute,
and braking and transmission gear selection to a remote computer. Telemetry
is used by broadcasters to help explain a car’s performance and can also be
used by teams during testing. Telemetry cannot be used during an official
NASCAR event.
Templates
Individual pieces of metal that conform to the body of a car. They are blueprints
of each car’s shape, used to ensure that cars conform to NASCAR specifications.
Tight
When the front tires don’t turn well through the turns because they’re
losing traction before the rear tires are. When a car is tight, it also means
it’s pushing — and if a driver isn’t careful, he’ll end up zooming right into
the wall. See also loose.
Tire carrier
Pit crew member who hands the tires to the tire changers and takes the used
tires away.
Tire changer
Pit crew member who changes tires — one changes the front tires, another
changes the rear tires.

284
Part VI: Appendixes 
Tire management
A driver keeps from pushing his car too hard so that his tires last longer.
Tire specialist
Team member who changes the air pressure, measures the wear, and moni-
tors the temperature of the tires during practice, qualifying, and races.
Track bar
The part of the rear suspension that’s attached to the frame on one side and
to the rear axle on the other. It keeps the car’s rear tires centered within the
car’s body. Also called the Panhard bar.
Transponder
A transponder is a transmitter that teams attach to the right side of the car’s
fuel cell container. It is used for timing and scoring.
Tri-oval
A modified oval racetrack with an extra turn to it, albeit a slight turn, instead
of just four turns. Usually that turn is located mid-way down the frontstretch.
Trunk lid
See deck lid.
Victory Lane
A roped-off or fenced-in area located in the infield where drivers, crews,
owners, sponsors, and their families celebrate a victory.
Wedge
Putting in wedge means putting more weight onto a wheel by compressing the
spring. Teams can put wedge into the rear tires only during a race by inserting
a wrench into a hole above the tires. A round of wedge is also called a round
of bite.
Wheelbase
The distance between the axles on the same side of the car.
Wind tunnel
A tunnel that shoots wind at a car. It’s used to research how a car cuts through
air as it moves forward. The car can be rotated so the tunnel shoots wind at
the car from all different angles.
Window nets
Screens made of a nylon mesh material that cover the driver’s side window.
They keep the driver’s arms and head in the car in the event of an accident.

Race Car Numbers
I
n NASCAR racing, each car has its own car number, just as each pro basket-
ball player has a number on his or her jersey. It’s an easy way to identify a
car on the track, especially when you can’t see the driver’s face as he zooms
by or read his name on the car. If you want to be a knowledgeable race fan and
fit in with the race crowd, car numbers are vital to know. A lot of times, people
refer to a car number only, not the team name or driver, when they’re talking
about a car. A person might say, “The 17 was the strongest car out there, don’t
you think?” What he just said was that he thought Matt Kenseth’s Ford Taurus
was great that day.
Teams have to apply for their car number at the beginning of each season,
however, a few of the racers have become linked to their car numbers for eter-
nity, such as Dale Earnhardt and his No. 3 Chevy (which was actually retired
at the end of his career) or Richard Petty and his No. 43 car. Jeff Gordon will
always be known as the driver of the No. 24 Chevy — particularly since he
plans to drive that car until he retires.
Look for the following race car numbers to locate your favorite drivers during
a race:

NASCAR Milestones
A
ll major sports undergo change, and NASCAR is no exception. In the
beginning, the strictly stock division cars were driven off the street and
onto the track. But as safety technology advanced, alterations were made
to the cars; the racing machines of today are more complicated than ever.
NASCAR itself also has grown with the series from a small organization
formed on the beaches of Daytona to one of the premier sports in America.
This appendix gives you a rundown of important NASCAR milestones:

Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida, to discuss the future of stock car racing.
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is conceived.

June 19, 1949: The first NASCAR “Strictly Stock” (the current NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup Series) race is held at Charlotte Fairgrounds Speedway in North Carolina,
with Bob Flock winning the pole and Jim Roper the race. Sara Christian was

October 16, 1949: Red Byron becomes the first NASCAR Strictly Stock cham-
pion, earning $5,800 for two wins in six starts.

1958: Florida’s sportswriters vote Fireball Roberts as Professional Athlete of
the Year, the first time the honor went to a race car driver.
February 23, 1958: Paul Goldsmith captures the final race on Daytona’s
beach course.

The NASCAR NEXTEL Cup season begins
under the lights with the Budweiser
Shootout each February at Daytona
International Speedway.
Only the drivers and their cars separate the
thousands of fans in the grandstands and
the team haulers in the infield.

Mark Martin, Matt Kenseth, and Dale
Earnhardt Jr. share a laugh before the race.
Mark Martin and crew chief Pat Tryson hold
a meeting with members of their crew to
plan race strategy.

One of the most impressive sights at any
NASCAR race is the line of drivers and
crewmen standing at attention for the
national anthem.
Mark Martin in full concentration mode
before the signal, “Gentlemen, start your
engines!”

Drivers line up double file behind the pace
car as the race is ready to begin.
Jeff Gordon takes an early lead with a pack
of rivals just behind his bumper.

Pit road is controlled chaos, with each driver
trying to find his stall. A crewman holds up
the car number to help the driver.
Matt Kenseth’s crew, called the “killer bees,”
prepares to service the car of the 2003 series
champion.

Pit crews can change four tires in less than
15 seconds.
A crewman for NASCAR Craftsman Truck 
driver Travis Kvapil makes sure a tire isn’t
rubbing against the fender.

Race tracks may look clean from afar, but up
close, rubber from tire wear is scattered
everywhere.
Drivers make the first turn in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series.

Tens of thousands of fans pack the stands
during NASCAR races across the nation.
NASCAR fans come in every shape, size, age, and gender to
enjoy the fast-paced action.

Cars slow down and line up single file when
the caution flag flies.

Jeff Gordon (No. 24) gets a half-car edge on the
inside groove over Michael Waltrip (No. 15).

At many tracks, not even the cheers of more
than 100,000 fans can drown out the sound
of 43 racing engines.
Fans arrive early and party hearty in the
infield as drivers zoom around them.

One of the most dangerous parts of a race? The
high-five huddle of a winning pit crew.

Mark Martin climbs from his car, definitely
the number-one driver this day.

A spray of bubbles is the traditional way to
celebrate a winning effort.
The race isn’t over for winner Mark
Martin when he takes the checkered flag;
the nation wants to know how he did it.

The ten proud drivers vying for the 2004 NASCAR NEXTEL
Cup championship get friendly — for the moment — at
Richmond International Raceway in Virginia.

NASCAR fans are known to be as proud of the
American flag as they are of their favorite driver.
