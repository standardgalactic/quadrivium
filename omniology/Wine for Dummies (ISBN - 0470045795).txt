About the Authors
Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan are two wine lovers who met at an
Italian wine tasting in New York City’s Chinatown and subsequently merged
their wine cellars and wine libraries when they married. They have since co-
authored six wine books in the Wine For Dummies series (including two of
their favorites, French Wine For Dummies and Italian Wine For Dummies) as
well as their latest book, Wine Style (Wiley); taught hundreds of wine classes
together; visited nearly every wine region in the world; run five marathons;
and raised eleven cats. Along the way, they have amassed more than half a
century of professional wine experience between them.
Mary is president of International Wine Center, a New York City wine school
that offers credentialed wine education for wine professionals and serious
wine lovers. As U.S. director of the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET®),
the world’s leading wine educational organization, she works to make the
courses she offers in New York available in more and more parts of the
United States. She is also the long-standing wine columnist of the NY Daily
News. Mary’s most impressive credential is that she’s the first female Master
of Wine (MW) in the United States, and one of only 22 MW’s in North America
(with 251 worldwide).
Ed, a New Yorker, graduated from City University of NY with a master’s degree
in psychology. He taught high school English in another life, while working
part-time in wine shops to satisfy his passion for wine and to subsidize his
growing wine cellar. That cellar is especially heavy in his favorite wines —
Bordeaux, Barolo, and Champagne. Besides co-authoring six wine books in
the For Dummies series with Mary, Ed went solo as author of Champagne For
Dummies, a topic on which he’s especially expert.
Ed and Mary also share wine columns in Nation’s Restaurant News and in
Beverage Media, a trade publication. They are each columnists for the online
wine magazine, WineReviewOnline.com. Ed and Mary are both accredited as
Certified Wine Educators (CWE).
When they aren’t writing, teaching, or visiting wine regions, Mary and Ed main-
tain a busy schedule of speaking, judging at professional wine competitions,
and tasting as many new wines as possible. They admit to leading thoroughly
unbalanced lives in which their only non-wine pursuits are hiking in the
Berkshires and the Italian Alps. At home, they wind down to the tunes of U2,
K.D. Lang, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young in the company of their feline roommates
Dolcetto, Black & Whitey, Ponzi, and Pinot.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
The wine world is dynamic — it’s constantly changing. Because three years
have passed since the third edition of Wine For Dummies, we decided to
revise and update the book. We especially felt an obligation to write this
fourth edition because of all the readers who have personally told us how
valuable Wine For Dummies has been to them. We are grateful that we’ve
been able to contribute to your knowledge about this wonderful beverage.
But this book would not have been possible without the team at Wiley. We
sincerely thank Publisher Diane Steele, who engaged us to write the fourth
edition of Wine For Dummies, along with Acquisitions Editor Stacy Kennedy.
Really special thanks go to our Project Editor, Traci Cumbay, who made excel-
lent suggestions to improve the text.
We thank our technical reviewer, colleague Igor Ryjenkov, MW, for his expertise.
It’s a better, more accurate book because of you.
Special thanks to Steve Ettlinger, our agent and friend, who brought us to the
For Dummies series in the first place, and who is always there for us. 
We thank all our friends in the wine business for your information and kind
suggestions for our book; the book reviewers, whose criticism has been so
generous; and our readers, who have encouraged us with your enthusiasm
for our previous books in this series. 
Mary offers special thanks to Linda Lawry and everyone else at International
Wine Center, who enabled her to have the time and the peace of mind to work
on this book. Thanks also to Elise McCarthy, E.J. McCarthy, Cindy McCarthy
Tomarchio and her husband, David, for their encouragement and support.

Introduction
W
e love wine. We love the way it tastes, we love the fascinating variety
of wines in the world, and we love the way wine brings people together
at the dinner table. We believe that you and everyone else should be able to
enjoy wine — regardless of your experience or your budget.
But we’ll be the first to admit that wine people, such as many wine profes-
sionals and really serious connoisseurs, don’t make it easy for regular people
to enjoy wine. You have to know strange names of grape varieties and foreign
wine regions. You have to figure out whether to buy a $20 wine or an $8 wine
that seem to be pretty much the same thing. You even need a special tool to
open the bottle once you get it home!
All this complication surrounding wine will never go away, because wine is a
very rich and complex field. But you don’t have to let the complication stand
in your way. With the right attitude and a little understanding of what wine is,
you can begin to buy and enjoy wine. And if, like us, you decide that wine is
fascinating, you can find out more and turn it into a wonderful hobby.
Because we hate to think that wine, which has brought so much pleasure into
our lives, could be the source of anxiety for anyone, we want to help you feel
more comfortable around wine. Some knowledge of wine, gleaned from the
pages of this book and from our shared experiences, will go a long way toward
increasing your comfort level.
Ironically, what will really make you feel comfortable about wine is accepting
the fact that you’ll never know it all — and that you’ve got plenty of company.
You see, after you really get a handle on wine, you discover that no one knows
everything there is to know about wine. There’s just too much information,
and it’s always changing. And when you know that, you can just relax and
enjoy the stuff.
About This Book
If you already have a previous edition of Wine For Dummies, you may be 
wondering whether you need this book. We believe that you do. We wrote

Wine For Dummies in 1995, and the world of wine has changed a lot since then.
It has even changed since our third edition in 2003:
 Dozens of wineries have opened, a few have gone out of business, many
have improved, and a few have slipped. Web sites on wine have come
and gone. The wine auction scene bears almost no resemblance to what
it was. Our recommendations reflect all these changes.
 Remember those prices that we listed for your favorite wines in our ear-
lier editions? Well, big surprise: Just about all those prices have increased.
But we point out some bargains, especially in Parts III, IV, and V.
 Several new vintages have occurred; we give you the lowdown on them
throughout the book, and especially in our vintage chart in Appendix C.
 Great wine regions of yesterday, such as Spain, Hungary and Greece,
have revitalized themselves, and we tell you about them. Also in this 
edition, we’ve updated the wine regions of Italy, California, Washington,
Chile, and Argentina, among others.
We wrote this book to be an easy-to-use reference. You don’t have to read it
from cover to cover for it to make sense and be useful to you. Simply turn to
the section that interests you and dig in.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, we’ve established the following conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars, which are shaded boxes of text, consist of information that’s
interesting but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the
topic.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you picked up this book for one of several reasons:
 You know very little about wine, but have a strong desire to learn more.
 You do know something about wine, more than most people, but you
want to understand it better, from the ground up.
2
Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition 

 You’re already very knowledgeable but realize that you can always 
discover more or want to see whether we’ve made any mistakes so
that you can brag to your friends that you caught us in a flagrant error.
(Maybe you think that a particular vintage in Bordeaux wasn’t nearly as
good as we said, for example.)
We also assume that you don’t have a lot of ego invested in wine — or maybe
you do, and you’re buying this book “for your sister-in-law.” And we assume that
you are someone who doesn’t appreciate a lot of mumbo-jumbo and jargonistic
language about wine, and that you’re someone who wants straight talk instead.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is a wine textbook of sorts, a user’s manual, and a reference book, all
in one. We’ve included very basic information about wine for readers who know
nothing (or next to nothing) about wine — but we have also included tips, sug-
gestions, and more sophisticated information for seasoned wine drinkers who
want to take their hobby to a more advanced level. Depending on where you
fall on the wine-knowledge gradient, different chapters will be relevant to you.
Part I: Getting to Know Wine
The five chapters in Part I get you up and sipping even if you’ve never tasted
wine in your life. We tell you the basic types of wine, how to taste it, which
grapes make wine, why winemaking matters, and how wines are named.
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close 
and Personal
This part deals with practical wine matters — in the wine shop, in the restau-
rant, and in your home. Find out how to handle snooty wine clerks, restaurant
wine lists, and those stubborn corks. In addition, we show you how to decipher
cryptic wine labels.
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine
Visit this part for a tour of the major wine regions of Europe: France, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and Greece.

Introduction

Part IV: Discovering the 
New World of Wine
Here we adventure to Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South
Africa, and then take a look at the major wine areas in the United States —
California, Oregon, Washington, and New York — and end with a quick look at
Canada’s wines.
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face
Some of the most exciting and fascinating wines are in this part, including
Champagne, Sherry, Port, Sauternes, and other exotic dessert wines.
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug
You find a wealth of practical advice in this part, including recommendations
on where and how you can buy wine beyond your local wine shops. We tell
you how to describe and rate wines you taste, and how to pair food and wine.
We also tell you how to store wine properly, and how to pursue your love and
knowledge of wine beyond this book.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
What For Dummies book would be complete without this part? It’s a synopsis
of interesting tips and recommendations about wine to reinforce our sugges-
tions earlier in the book. We’re particularly happy to debunk ten prevalent
myths about wine so that you can become a savvier consumer and a more
satisfied wine drinker.
Part VIII: Appendixes
In Part VIII, we show you how to pronounce foreign wine words, and you can
look up unfamiliar wine terms in our glossary. You can also consult our vin-
tage chart to check out the quality and drinkability of your wine.

Icons Used in This Book
This odd little guy is a bit like the two-year-old who constantly insists on
knowing “Why, Mommy, why?” But he knows that you may not have the
same level of curiosity that he has. Where you see him, feel free to skip 
over the technical information that follows. Wine will still taste just as 
delicious.
Advice and information that will make you a wiser wine drinker or buyer is
marked by this bull’s-eye so that you won’t miss it.
There’s very little you can do in the course of moderate wine consumption
that can land you in jail — but you could spoil an expensive bottle and sink
into a deep depression over your loss. This symbol warns you about
common pitfalls.
Some issues in wine are so fundamental that they bear repeating. Just so you
don’t think that we repeated ourselves without realizing it, we mark the repe-
titions with this symbol.
Wine snobs practice all sorts of affectations designed to make other wine
drinkers feel inferior. But you won’t be intimidated by their snobbery if you
see it for what it is. (And you can learn how to impersonate a wine snob!)
A bargain’s not a bargain unless you really like the outfit, as they say. To our
tastes, the wines we mark with this icon are bargains because we like them,
we believe them to be of good quality, and their price is low compared to
other wines of similar type, style, or quality. You can also interpret this logo
as a badge of genuineness, as in “This Chablis is the real deal.”
Unfortunately, some of the finest, most intriguing, most delicious wines are
made in very small quantities. Usually, those wines cost more than wines
made in large quantities — but that’s not the only problem; the real frustra-
tion is that those wines have very limited distribution, and you can’t always
get your hands on a bottle even if you’re willing to pay the price. We mark
such wines with this icon, and hope that your search proves fruitful.

Part I
Getting to Know
Wine

In this part . . .
T
o grasp the material in this part of the book, you need
some preliminary knowledge: what a grape is, and
where your tongue and nose are located.
If you have those bases covered, you’re ready to begin
understanding and enjoying wine — even if you’ve never
tasted wine before in your life. We start slowly so that you
can enjoy the scenery along the way.

Chapter 1
Wine 101
In This Chapter
 What wine is
 Million-dollar words like fermentation and sulfites
 What red wine has that white wine doesn’t
 Why color matters
 Differences between table wine, sparkling wine, and fortified wine
W
e know plenty of people who enjoy drinking wine but don’t know much
about it. (Been there, done that ourselves.) Knowing a lot of information
about wine definitely isn’t a prerequisite to enjoying it. But familiarity with
certain aspects of wine can make choosing wines a lot easier, enhance your
enjoyment of wine, and increase your comfort level. You can learn as much or
as little as you like. The journey begins here.
How Wine Happens
Wine is, essentially, nothing but liquid, fermented fruit. The recipe for turning
fruit into wine goes something like this:
1. Pick a large quantity of ripe grapes from grapevines.
You could substitute raspberries or any other fruit, but 99.9 percent of
all the wine in the world is made from grapes, because they make the
best wines.
2. Put the grapes into a clean container that doesn’t leak.
3. Crush the grapes somehow to release their juice.
Once upon a time, feet performed this step.
4. Wait.
In its most basic form, winemaking is that simple. After the grapes are crushed,
yeasts (tiny one-celled organisms that exist naturally in the vineyard and,
therefore, on the grapes) come into contact with the sugar in the grapes’
juice and gradually convert that sugar into alcohol. Yeasts also produce

carbon dioxide, which evaporates into the air. When the yeasts are done
working, your grape juice is wine. The sugar that was in the juice is no longer
there — alcohol is present instead. (The riper and sweeter the grapes, the
more alcohol the wine will have.) This process is called fermentation.
What could be more natural?
Fermentation is a totally natural process that doesn’t require man’s participa-
tion at all, except to put the grapes into a container and release the juice
from the grapes. Fermentation occurs in fresh apple cider left too long in
your refrigerator, without any help from you. In fact we read that milk, which
contains a different sort of sugar than grapes do, develops a small amount of
alcohol if left on the kitchen table all day long.
Speaking of milk, Louis Pasteur is the man credited with discovering fermenta-
tion in the nineteenth century. That’s discovering, not inventing. Some of those
apples in the Garden of Eden probably fermented long before Pasteur came
along. (Well, we don’t think it could have been much of an Eden without wine!)
Modern wrinkles in winemaking
Now if every winemaker actually made wine in as crude a manner as we just
described, we’d be drinking some pretty rough stuff that would hardly inspire
us to write a wine book.
But today’s winemakers have a bag of tricks as big as a sumo wrestler’s
appetite. That’s one reason why no two wines ever taste exactly the same.
The men and women who make wine can control the type of container they use
for the fermentation process (stainless steel and oak are the two main materi-
als), as well as the size of the container and the temperature of the juice during
fermentation — and every one of these choices can make a big difference in the
taste of the wine. After fermentation, they can choose how long to let the wine
mature (a stage when the wine sort of gets its act together) and in what kind of
container. Fermentation can last three days or three months, and the wine can
then mature for a couple of weeks or a couple of years or anything in between.
If you have trouble making decisions, don’t ever become a winemaker.
The main ingredient
Obviously, one of the biggest factors in making one wine different from the
next is the nature of the raw material, the grape juice. Besides the fact that
riper, sweeter grapes make a more alcoholic wine, different varieties of grapes
(Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, or Merlot, for example) make different
10
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

wines. Grapes are the main ingredient in wine, and everything the winemaker
does, he does to the particular grape juice he has. Chapter 3 covers specific
grapes and the kinds of wine they make.
Local flavor
Grapes, the raw material of wine, don’t grow in a void. Where they grow — the
soil and climate of each wine region, as well as the traditions and goals of the
people who grow the grapes and make the wine — affects the nature of the ripe
grapes, and the taste of the wine made from those grapes. That’s why so much
of the information there is to learn about wine revolves around the countries
and the regions where wine is made. In the five chapters that comprise Parts III
and IV of this book, we cover all the world’s major wine regions and their wines.
What Color Is Your Appetite?
Your inner child will be happy to know that when it comes to wine, it’s okay
to like some colors more than others. You can’t get away with saying “I don’t
like green food!” much beyond your sixth birthday, but you can express a
general preference for white, red, or pink wine for all your adult years.
(Not exactly) white wine
Whoever coined the term “white wine” must have been colorblind. All you
have to do is look at it to see that it’s not white, it’s yellow. But we’ve all
gotten used to the expression by now, and so white wine it is.
White wine is wine without any red color (or pink color, which is in the red
family). This means that White Zinfandel, a popular pink wine, isn’t white
wine. But yellow wines, golden wines, and wines that are as pale as water are
all white wines.
Wine becomes white wine in one of two ways. First, white wine can be made
from white grapes — which, by the way, aren’t white. (Did you see that one
coming?) White grapes are greenish, greenish yellow, golden yellow, or some-
times even pinkish yellow. Basically, white grapes include all the grape types
that are not dark red or dark bluish. If you make a wine from white grapes, it’s
a white wine.
The second way a wine can become white is a little more complicated. The
process involves using red grapes — but only the juice of red grapes, not the
grape skins. The juice of most red grapes has no red pigmentation — only the
skins do — and so a wine made with only the juice of red grapes can be a
11
Chapter 1: Wine 101

white wine. In practice, though, very few white wines come from red grapes.
(Champagne is one exception; Chapter 14 addresses the use of red grapes to
make Champagne.)
In case you’re wondering, the skins are removed from the grapes by either
pressing large quantities of grapes so that the juice flows out and the skins
stay behind — sort of like squeezing the pulp out of grapes, the way kids do
in the cafeteria — or by crushing the grapes in a machine that has rollers to
break the skins so that the juice can drain away.
Is white always right?
You can drink white wine anytime you like — which for most people means
as a drink without food or with lighter foods. Chapter 19 covers the dynamics
of pairing wines with food.
12
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
The skinny on sulfites
Sulfur dioxide, a compound formed from sulfur
and oxygen, occurs naturally during fermenta-
tion in very small quantities. Winemakers add it,
too. Sulfur dioxide is to wine what aspirin and
vitamin E are to humans — a wonder drug that
cures all sorts of afflictions and prevents others.
Sulfur dioxide is an antibacterial, preventing the
wine from turning to vinegar. It inhibits yeasts,
preventing sweet wines from refermenting in the
bottle. It’s an antioxidant, keeping the wine fresh
and untainted by the demon oxygen. Despite
these magical properties, winemakers try to use
as little sulfur dioxide as possible because many
of them share a belief that the less you add to
wine, the better (just as many people prefer to
ingest as little medication as possible).
Now here’s a bit of irony for you:
Today — when winemaking is so advanced that
winemakers need to rely on sulfur dioxide’s help
less than ever before — most wine labels in
America state “Contains Sulfites” (meaning sulfur
dioxide). That’s because Congress passed a law
in 1988 requiring that phrase on the label. So
now many wine drinkers understandably think
that there’s more sulfur in the wine than there
used to be; but, in reality, sulfur dioxide use is
probably at an all-time low.
Approximately 5 percent of asthmatics are
extremely sensitive to sulfites. To protect them,
Congress mandated that any wine containing
more than 10 parts per million of sulfites carry
the “Contains Sulfites” phrase on its label.
Considering that about 10 to 20 parts per million
occur naturally in wine, that covers just about
every wine. (The exception is organic wines,
which are intentionally made without the addition
of sulfites; some of them are low enough in sulfites
that they don’t have to use the mandated phrase.)
Actual sulfite levels in wine range from about 30
to 150 parts per million (about the same as in dried
apricots); the legal max in the United States is
350. White dessert wines have the most sulfur —
followed by medium-sweet white wines and
blush wines — because those types of wine
need the most protection. Dry white wines gen-
erally have less, and dry reds have the least.

White wines are often considered apéritif wines, meaning wines consumed
before dinner, in place of cocktails, or at parties. (If you ask the officials who
busy themselves defining such things, an apéritif wine is a wine that has flavors
added to it, as vermouth does. But unless you’re in the business of writing
wine labels for a living, don’t worry about that. In common parlance, an
apéritif wine is just what we said.)
A lot of people like to drink white wines when the weather is hot because
they’re more refreshing than red wines, and they’re usually drunk chilled
(the wines, not the people).
We serve white wines cool, but not ice-cold. Sometimes restaurants serve
white wines too cold, and we actually have to wait a while for the wine to warm
up before we drink it. If you like your wine cold, fine; but try drinking your
favorite white wine a little less cold sometime, and we bet you’ll discover it
has more flavor that way. In Chapter 8, we recommend specific serving tem-
peratures for various types of wine.
13
Chapter 1: Wine 101
White wine styles: There’s no such thing 
as plain white wine
White wines fall into four general taste cate-
gories, not counting sparkling wine or the really
sweet white wine that you drink with dessert
(see Chapter 15 for more on those). If the words
we use to describe these taste categories
sound weird, take heart — they’re all explained
in Chapter 2. We also explain the styles in plen-
tiful detail in our book, Wine Style (Wiley). Here
are the four broad categories:
 Some white wines are fresh, unoaked
whites — crisp and light, with no sweetness
and no oaky character. (Turn to Chapter 3 for
the lowdown on oak.) Most Italian white
wines, like Soave and Pinot Grigio, and some
French whites, like Sancerre and some
Chablis wines, fall into this category.
 Some white wines are earthy whites — dry,
fuller-bodied, unoaked or lightly oaked, with
a lot of earthy character. Some French wines,
such as Mâcon or whites from the Côtes du
Rhône region (covered in Chapter 9) have
this taste profile.
 Some white wines are aromatic whites,
characterized by intense aromas and fla-
vors that come from their particular grape
variety, whether they’re off-dry (that is, not
bone-dry) or dry. Examples include a lot of
German wines, and wines from flavorful
grape varieties such as Riesling or Viognier.
 Finally, some white wines are rich, oaky
whites — dry or fairly dry, and full-bodied
with pronounced oaky character. Most
Chardonnays and many French wines —
like many of those from the Burgundy region
of France — fall into this group.

For suggestions of foods to eat with white wine, turn to Chapter 19; for really
detailed information about white wine and food (and white wine itself, for
that matter), refer to our book White Wine For Dummies (Wiley).
Red, red wine
In this case, the name is correct. Red wines really are red. They can be purple
red, ruby red, or garnet, but they’re red.
Red wines are made from grapes that are red or bluish in color. So guess what
wine people call these grapes? Black grapes! We suppose that’s because black
is the opposite of white.
The most obvious difference between red wine and white wine is color. The red
color occurs when the colorless juice of red grapes stays in contact with the
dark grape skins during fermentation and absorbs the skins’ color. Along with
color, the grape skins give the wine tannin, a substance that’s an important
part of the way a red wine tastes. (See Chapter 2 for more about tannin.)
The presence of tannin in red wines is actually the most important taste 
difference between red wines and white wines.
Red wines vary quite a lot in style. This is partly because winemakers have
so many ways of adjusting their red-winemaking to achieve the kind of wine
they want. For example, if winemakers leave the juice in contact with the
skins for a long time, the wine becomes more tannic (firmer in the mouth, like
strong tea; tannic wines can make you pucker). If winemakers drain the juice
off the skins sooner, the wine is softer and less tannic.
14
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Red wine styles: There’s no such thing 
as just plain red wine, either
Here are four red wine styles:
 Soft, fruity reds are relatively light-bodied,
with a lot of fruitiness and little tannin (like
Beaujolais Nouveau wine from France, some
Valpolicellas from Italy, and many under-$10
U.S. wines).
 Mild-mannered reds aremedium-bodied with
subtle, un-fruity flavors (like less expensive
wines from Bordeaux, in France, and some
inexpensive Italian reds).
 Spicy reds are flavorful, fruity wines with
spicy accents and some tannin (such as
some Malbecs from France or Argentina,
and Dolcettos from Italy).
 Powerful reds are full-bodied and tannic
(such as the most expensive California
Cabernets; Barolo, from Italy; the most
expensive Australian reds; and lots of other
expensive reds).

Red wine tends to be consumed more often as part of a meal than as a drink
on its own.
Thanks to the wide range of red wine styles, you can find red wines to go with
just about every type of food and every occasion when you want to drink
wine (except the times when you want to drink a wine with bubbles, because
most bubbly wines are white or pink). In Chapter 19, we give you some tips
on matching red wine with food. You can also consult our book about red
wine, Red Wine For Dummies (Wiley).
One sure way to spoil the fun in drinking most red wines is to drink them too
cold. Those tannins can taste really bitter when the wine is cold — just as in
a cold glass of very strong tea. On the other hand, many restaurants serve
red wines too warm. (Where do they store them? Next to the boiler?) If the
bottle feels cool to your hand, that’s a good temperature. For more about
serving wine at the right temperature, see Chapter 8.
A rose is a rose, but a rosé is “white”
Rosé wines are pink wines. Rosé wines are made from red grapes, but they
don’t end up red because the grape juice stays in contact with the red skins
for a very short time — only a few hours, compared to days or weeks for red
wines. Because this skin contact (the period when the juice and the skins
intermingle) is brief, rosé wines absorb very little tannin from the skins.
Therefore, you can chill rosé wines and drink them as you would white wines.
Of course, not all rosé wines are called rosés. (That would be too simple.)
Many rosé wines today are called blush wines — a term invented by wine
marketers to avoid the word rosé, because back in the ’80s, pink wines
weren’t very popular. Lest someone figures out that blush is a synonym for
rosé, the labels call these wines white. But even a child can see that White
Zinfandel is really pink.
15
Chapter 1: Wine 101
Red wine sensitivities
Some people complain that they can’t drink red
wines without getting a headache or feeling ill.
Usually, they blame the sulfites in the wine.
We’re not doctors or scientists, but we can tell
you that red wines contain far less sulfur than
white wines. That’s because the tannin in red
wines acts as a preservative, making sulfur
dioxide less necessary. Red wines do contain
histamine-like compounds and other substances
derived from the grape skins that could be the
culprits. Whatever the source of the discomfort,
it’s probably not sulfites.

The blush wines that call themselves white are fairly sweet. Wines labeled
rosé can be sweetish, too, but some wonderful rosés from Europe (and a few
from America, too) are dry (not sweet). Some hard-core wine lovers hardly
ever drink rosé wine, but many wine drinkers are discovering what a pleasure
a good rosé wine can be, especially in warm weather.
Which type when?
Your choice of a white wine, red wine, or rosé wine will vary with the season,
the occasion, and the type of food that you’re eating (not to mention your
personal taste!). Choosing a color usually is the starting point for selecting a
specific wine in a wine shop or in a restaurant. As we explain in Chapters 6
and 7, most stores and most restaurant wine lists arrange wines by color
before making other distinctions, such as grape varieties, wine regions, or
taste categories.
Although certain foods can straddle the line between white wine and red
wine compatibility — grilled salmon, for example, can be delicious with a rich
white wine or a fruity red — your preference for red, white, or pink wine will
often be your first consideration in pairing wine with food, too.
Pairing food and wine is one of the most fun aspects of wine, because the
possible combinations are almost limitless. (We get you started with the pair-
ing principles and a few specific suggestions in Chapter 19.) Best of all, your
personal taste rules!
Other Ways of Categorizing Wine
We sometimes play a game with our friends: “Which wine,” we ask them,
“would you want to have with you if you were stranded on a desert island?”
In other words, which wine could you drink for the rest of your life without
getting tired of it? Our own answer is always Champagne, with a capital C
(more on the capitalization later in this section).
In a way, it’s an odd choice because, as much as we love Champagne, we don’t
drink it every day under normal circumstances. We welcome guests with it,
we celebrate with it after our team wins a Sunday football game, and we toast
our cats with it on their birthdays. We don’t need much of an excuse to drink
Champagne, but it’s not the type of wine we drink every night.
What we drink every night is regular wine — red, white, or pink — without
bubbles. There are various names for these wines. In America, they’re called
table wines, and in Europe they’re called light wines. Sometimes we refer to
them as still wines, because they don’t have bubbles moving around in them.
16
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

In the following sections, we explain the differences between three categories
of wines: table wines, dessert wines, and sparkling wines.
Table wine
Table wine, or light wine, is fermented grape juice whose alcohol content falls
within a certain range. Furthermore, table wine is not bubbly. (Some table
wines have a very slight carbonation, but not enough to disqualify them as
table wines.) According to U.S. standards of identification, table wines may
have an alcohol content no higher than 14 percent; in Europe, light wine must
contain from 8.5 percent to 14 percent alcohol by volume (with a few excep-
tions). So unless a wine has more than 14 percent alcohol or has bubbles, it’s
a table wine or a light wine in the eyes of the law.
The regulations-makers didn’t get the number 14 by drawing it from a hat.
Historically, most wines contained less than 14 percent alcohol — either
because there wasn’t enough sugar in the juice to attain a higher alcohol
level, or because the yeasts died off when the alcohol reached 14 percent,
halting the fermentation. That number, therefore, became the legal border-
line between wines that have no alcohol added to them (table wines) and
wines that may have alcohol added to them (see “Dessert wine,” in the next
section).
Today, however, the issue isn’t as clear-cut as it was when the laws were writ-
ten. Many grapes are now grown in warm climates where they become so
ripe, and have so much natural sugar, that their juice attains more than 14
percent alcohol when it’s fermented. The use of gonzo yeast strains that con-
tinue working even when the alcohol exceeds 14 percent is another factor.
Many red Zinfandels, Cabernets, and Chardonnays from California now have

2. When a red wine just seems too heavy
3. With lunch — hamburgers, grilled cheese

4. On picnics on warm, sunny days
5. To wean your son/daughter, mate, friend
(yourself?) off cola
6. On warm evenings
7. To celebrate the arrival of spring or summer
8. With ham (hot or cold) or other pork dishes

your wine
10. On Valentine’s Day (or any other pink 
occasion)

14.5 or even 15.5 percent alcohol. Wine drinkers still consider them table
wines, but legally they don’t qualify. (Technically, they’re dessert wines, and
are taxed at a higher rate.) Which is just to say that laws and reality don’t
always keep pace.
Here’s our own, real-world definition of table wines: They are the normal,
non-bubbly wines that most people drink most of the time.
Dessert wine
Many wines have more than 14 percent alcohol because the winemaker
added alcohol during or after the fermentation. That’s an unusual way of
making wine, but some parts of the world, like the Sherry region in Spain and
the Port region in Portugal, have made quite a specialty of it. We discuss
those wines in Chapter 15.
Dessert wine is the legal U.S. terminology for these wines, probably because
they’re usually sweet and often enjoyed after dinner. We find that term mislead-
ing, because dessert wines are not always sweet and not always consumed
after dinner. (Dry Sherry is categorized as a dessert wine, for example, but
it’s dry, and we drink it before dinner.)
In Europe, this category of wines is called liqueur wines, which carries the
same connotation of sweetness. We prefer the term fortified, which suggests
that the wine has been strengthened with additional alcohol. But until we get
elected to run things, the term will have to be dessert wine or liqueur wine.
18
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
How to (sort of) learn the alcohol content of a wine
Regulations require wineries to state a wine’s
alcohol percentage on the label (again, with
some minor exceptions). It can be expressed in
degrees, like 12.5 degrees, or as a percentage,
like 12.5 percent. If a wine carries the words
“Table Wine” on its label in the United States,
but not the alcohol percentage, it should have
less than 14 percent alcohol by law.
For wines sold within the United States —
whether the wine is American or imported —
there’s a big catch, however. The labels are
allowed to lie. U.S. regulations give wineries a
1.5 percent leeway in the accuracy of the alco-
hol level. If the label states 12.5 percent, the
actual alcohol level can be as high as 14 per-
cent or as low as 11 percent. The leeway does
not entitle the wineries to exceed the 14 percent
maximum, however.
If the alcohol percentage is stated as a number
that’s neither a full number nor a half-number —
12.8 or 13.2, for example, instead of 12.5 or 13 —
odds are it’s precise.

Sparkling wine (and a highly 
personal spelling lesson)
Sparkling wines are wines that contain carbon dioxide bubbles. Carbon diox-
ide gas is a natural byproduct of fermentation, and winemakers sometimes
decide to trap it in the wine. Just about every country that makes wine also
makes sparkling wine. In Chapter 14, we discuss how sparkling wine is made
and describe the major sparkling wines of the world.
In the United States, Canada, and Europe, sparkling wine is the official name
for the category of wines with bubbles. Isn’t it nice when everyone agrees?
Champagne (with a capital C) is the most famous sparkling wine — and prob-
ably the most famous wine, for that matter. Champagne is a specific type of
sparkling wine (made from certain grape varieties and produced in a certain
way) that comes from a region in France called Champagne. It is the undis-
puted Grand Champion of Bubblies.
Unfortunately for the people of Champagne, France, their wine is so famous
that the name champagne has been borrowed again and again by producers
elsewhere, until the word has become synonymous with practically the
whole category of sparkling wines. For example, until a recent agreement
between the United States and the European Union, U.S. winemakers could
legally call any sparkling wine champagne — even with a capital C, if they
wanted — as long as the carbonation was not added artificially. Even now,
those American wineries that were already using that name may continue to
do so. (They do have to add a qualifying geographic term such as American
or Californian before the word Champagne, however.)
19
Chapter 1: Wine 101
Popular white wines
These types of white wine are available almost
everywhere in the United States. We describe
these wines in Parts III and IV of this book.
 Chardonnay: Can come from California,
Australia, France, or almost any other place
 Sauvignon Blanc: Can come from California,
France, New Zealand, South Africa, and
other places
 Riesling: Can come from Germany,
California, New York, Washington, France,
Austria, Australia, and other places
 Pinot Grigio or Pinot Gris: Can come from
Italy, France, Oregon, California, and other
places
 Soave: Comes from Italy

For the French, limiting the use of the name champagne to the wines of the
Champagne region is a cause célèbre. European Union regulations not only
prevent any other member country from calling its sparkling wines champagne
but also prohibit the use of terms that even suggest the word champagne,
such as fine print on the label saying that a wine was made by using the
“champagne method.” What’s more, bottles of sparkling wine from countries
outside the European Union that use the word champagne on the label are
banned from sale in Europe. The French are that serious.
To us, this seems perfectly fair. You’ll never catch us using the word champagne
as a generic term for wine with bubbles. We have too much respect for the
people and the traditions of Champagne, France, where the best sparkling
wines in the world are made. That’s why we stress the capital “C” when we
say Champagne. Those are the wines we want on our desert island, not just
any sparkling wine from anywhere that calls itself champagne.
When someone tries to impress you by serving a “Champagne” that’s not
French, don’t rush to be impressed. Most respectable sparkling wine companies
in America won’t call their wines champagne out of respect for their French
counterparts. (Of course, many of California’s top sparkling wine companies are
actually owned by the French — so it’s no surprise that they won’t call their
wines champagne — but many other companies won’t use the term, either.)

W
e know they’re out there — the cynics who are saying, right about
now, “Hey, I already know how to taste. I do it every day, three to five
times a day. All that wine-tasting humbug is just another way of making wine
complicated.”
And you know, in a way, those cynics are right. Anyone who can taste coffee
or a hamburger can taste wine. All you need are a nose, taste buds, and a brain.
Unless you’re like our friend who lost his sense of smell from the chemicals
he used every day as a cosmetology teacher, you, too, have all that it takes to
taste wine properly.
You also have all that it takes to speak Mandarin. Having the ability to do some-
thing is different from knowing how to do it and applying that know-how in
everyday life, however.
The Special Technique for Tasting Wine
You drink beverages every day, tasting them as they pass through your mouth.
In the case of wine, however, drinking and tasting are not synonymous. Wine
is much more complex than other beverages: There’s more going on in a
mouthful of wine. For example, most wines have a lot of different (and subtle)
flavors, all at the same time, and they give you multiple sensations when
they’re in your mouth, such as softness and sharpness together.

If you just drink wine, gulping it down the way you do soda, you miss a lot
of what you paid for. But if you taste wine, you can discover its nuances.
In fact, the more slowly and attentively you taste wine, the more interesting
it tastes.
And with that, we have the two fundamental rules of wine tasting:
1. Slow down.
2. Pay attention.
The process of tasting a wine — of systematically experiencing all the wine’s
attributes — has three steps. The first two steps don’t actually involve your
mouth at all. First you look at the wine, and then you smell it.
Savoring wine’s good looks
We enjoy looking at the wine in our glass, noticing how brilliant it is and
the way it reflects the light, trying to decide precisely which shade of red 
it is and whether it will stain the tablecloth permanently if we tilt the glass
too far.
22
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Tips for smelling wine
 Be bold. Stick your nose right into the air-
space of the glass where the aromas are
captured.
 Don’t wear a strong scent; it will compete
with the smell of the wine.
 Don’t knock yourself out smelling a wine
when there are strong food aromas around.
The tomatoes you smell in the wine could
really be the tomato in someone’s pasta
sauce.
 Become a smeller. Smell every ingredient
when you cook, everything you eat, the
fresh fruits and vegetables you buy at the
supermarket, even the smells of your 
environment — like leather, wet earth, fresh
road tar, grass, flowers, your wet dog, shoe
polish, and your medicine cabinet. Stuff
your mental database with smells so that
you’ll have aroma memories at your dis-
posal when you need to draw on them.
 Try different techniques of sniffing. Some
people like to take short, quick sniffs, while
others like to inhale a deep whiff of the
wine’s smell. Keeping your mouth open a bit
while you inhale can help you perceive
aromas. (Some people even hold one nos-
tril closed and smell with the other, but we
think that’s a bit kinky.)

To observe a wine’s appearance, tilt a (half-full) glass away from you and look
at the color of the wine against a white background, such as the tablecloth
or a piece of paper (a colored background distorts the color of the wine).
Notice how dark or how pale the wine is, what color it is, and whether the
color fades from the center of the wine out toward the edge, where it touches
the glass. Also notice whether the wine is cloudy, clear, or brilliant. (Most wines
are clear. Some wines that are unfiltered — Chapter 5 explains filtering — can
be less than brilliant but shouldn’t be cloudy.) Eventually, you’ll begin to notice
patterns, such as deeper color in younger red wines.
If you have time to kill, at this point you can also swirl the wine around in
your glass (see the following section, “The nose knows”) and observe the
way the wine runs back down the inside of the glass. Some wines form legs or
tears that flow slowly down. Once upon a time, these legs were interpreted as
the sure sign of a rich, high-quality wine. Today, we know that a wine’s legs
are a complicated phenomenon having to do with the surface tension of the
wine and the evaporation rate of the wine’s alcohol. If you’re a physicist, this
is a good time to show off your expertise and enlighten your fellow tasters —
but otherwise, don’t bother drawing conclusions from the legs.
The nose knows
Now we get to the really fun part of tasting wine: swirling and sniffing. This is
when you can let your imagination run wild, and no one will ever dare to con-
tradict you. If you say that a wine smells like wild strawberries to you, how
can anyone prove that it doesn’t?
Before we explain the smelling ritual, and the tasting technique that goes
along with it (described in the next section), we want to assure you that: a)
you don’t have to apply this procedure to every single wine you drink; b) you
won’t look foolish doing it, at least in the eyes of other wine lovers (we can’t
speak for the other 90 percent of the human population); and c) it’s a great
trick at parties to avoid talking with someone you don’t like.
To get the most out of your sniffing, swirl the wine in the glass first. But don’t
even think about swirling your wine if your glass is more than half full.
Keep your glass on the table and rotate it three or four times so that the wine
swirls around inside the glass and mixes with air. Then quickly bring the
glass to your nose. Stick your nose into the airspace of the glass, and smell
the wine. Free-associate. Is the aroma fruity, woodsy, fresh, cooked, intense,
light? Your nose tires quickly, but it recovers quickly, too. Wait just a moment
and try again. Listen to your friends’ comments and try to find the same
things they find in the smell.
23
Chapter 2: These Taste Buds Are for You

As you swirl, the aromas in the wine vaporize, so that you can smell them.
Wine has so many aromatic compounds that whatever you find in the smell
of a wine is probably not merely a figment of your imagination.
The point behind this whole ritual of swirling and sniffing is that what you smell
should be pleasurable to you, maybe even fascinating, and that you should
have fun in the process. But what if you notice a smell that you don’t like?
Hang around wine geeks for a while, and you’ll start to hear words like petrol,
manure, sweaty saddle, burnt match, and asparagus used to describe the aromas
of some wines. “Yuck!” you say? Of course you do! Fortunately, the wines that
exhibit such smells are not the wines you’ll be drinking for the most part —
at least not unless you really catch the wine bug. And when you do catch the
wine bug, you may discover that those aromas, in the right wine, can really
be a kick. Even if you don’t learn to enjoy those smells (some of us do, honest!),
you’ll appreciate them as typical characteristics of certain regions or grapes.
Then there are the bad smells that nobody will try to defend. It doesn’t
happen often, but it does happen, because wine is a natural, agricultural
product with a will of its own. Often when a wine is seriously flawed, it shows
immediately in the nose of the wine. Wine judges have a term for such wines.
They call them DNPIM — Do Not Put In Mouth. Not that you’ll get ill, but
why subject your taste buds to the same abuse that your nose just took?
Sometimes it’s a bad cork that’s to blame, and sometimes it’s some other sort
of problem in the winemaking or even the storage of the wine. Just rack it up
to experience and open a different bottle.
24
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Wines have noses — and palates, too
With poetic license typical of wine tasters,
someone once dubbed the smell of a wine its
nose — and the expression took hold. If some-
one says that a wine has a huge nose, he means
that the wine has a very strong smell. If he says
that he detects lemon in the nose or on the
nose, he means that the wine smells a bit like
lemons.
In fact, most wine tasters rarely use the word
smell to describe how a wine smells because
the word smell (like the word odor) seems pejo-
rative. Wine tasters talk about the wine’s nose
or aroma. Sometimes they use the word bou-
quet, although that word is falling out of fashion.
Just as a wine taster might use the term nose
for the smell of a wine, he might use the word
palate in referring to the taste of a wine. A
wine’s palate is the overall impression the wine
gives in your mouth, or any isolated aspect of
the wine’s taste — as in “This wine has a har-
monious palate,” or “The palate of this wine is a
bit acidic.” When a wine taster says that he
finds raspberries on the palate, he means that
the wine has the flavor of raspberries.

While you’re choosing the next bottle, make up your own acronyms: SOTYWE
(Serve Only To Your Worst Enemies) for example, or ETMYG (Enough To Make
You Gag), or our own favorite, SLADDR (Smells Like A Dirty Dish Rag).
When it comes to smelling wine, many people are concerned that they
aren’t able to detect as many aromas as they think they should. Smelling
wine is really just a matter of practice and attention. If you start to pay
more attention to smells in your normal activities, you’ll get better at
smelling wine.
The mouth action
After you’ve looked at the wine and smelled it, you’re finally allowed to taste
it. This is when grown men and women sit around and make strange faces,
gurgling the wine and sloshing it around in their mouths with looks of intense
concentration in their eyes. You can make an enemy for life if you distract a
wine taster just at the moment when he is focusing all his energy on the last
few drops of a special wine.
Here’s how the procedure goes. Take a medium-sized sip of wine. Hold it
in your mouth, purse your lips, and draw in some air across your tongue,
over the wine. (Be utterly careful not to choke or dribble, or everyone
will strongly suspect that you’re not a wine expert.) Then swish the wine
around in your mouth as if you are chewing it. Then swallow it. The whole
process should take several seconds, depending on how much you are con-
centrating on the wine. (Wondering what to concentrate on? The next two
sections tell you, along with the section “Parlez-Vous Winespeak?” later in
this chapter.)

Feeling the tastes
Taste buds on the tongue can register various sensations, which are known
as the basic tastes. These include sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness,
and umami, a savory characteristic. Of these tastes, sweetness, sourness,
and bitterness are those most commonly found in wine. By moving the wine
around in your mouth, you give it a chance to hit all your taste buds so that
you don’t miss anything in the wine (even if sourness and bitterness sound
like things you wouldn’t mind missing).
As you swish the wine around in your mouth, you are also buying time.
Your brain needs a few seconds to figure out what the tongue is tasting and
make some sense of it. Any sweetness in the wine registers in your brain first
because many of the taste buds on the front of your tongue — where the
wine hits first — capture the sensation of sweetness; acidity (which, by the
way, is what normal people call sourness) and bitterness register subse-
quently. While your brain is working out the relative impressions of sweet-
ness, acidity, and bitterness, you can be thinking about how the wine feels in
your mouth — whether it’s heavy, light, smooth, rough, and so on.
Tasting the smells
Until you cut your nose in on the action, that’s all you can taste in the wine —
those three sensations of sweetness, acidity, and bitterness and a general
impression of weight and texture. Where have all the wild strawberries gone?
They’re still there in the wine, right next to the chocolate and plums. But to
be perfectly correct about it, these flavors are actually aromas that you taste,
not through tongue contact, but by inhaling them up an interior nasal pas-
sage in the back of your mouth called the retronasal passage (see Figure 2-1).
When you draw in air across the wine in your mouth, you are vaporizing the
aromas just as you did when you swirled the wine in your glass. There’s a
method to this madness.

After you go through all this rigmarole, it’s time to reach a conclusion: Do you
like what you tasted? The possible answers are yes, no, an indifferent shrug
of the shoulders, or “I’m not sure, let me take another taste,” which means
that you have serious wine-nerd potential.
Parlez-Vous Winespeak?
Now we have to confess that there is one step between knowing how to taste
wine and always drinking wine that you like. And it’s a doozy. That step is
putting taste into words.
We wouldn’t have to bother with this detail if only we could always choose
our wines the way that customers choose cheese in a gourmet shop. (“Can I
try that one? No, I don’t like it; let me taste the one next to it. Good. I’ll take
half a pound.”)
“Like/Don’t Like” is a no-brainer once you have the wine in your mouth. But
most of the time you have to buy the stuff without tasting it first. So unless
you want to drink the same wine for the rest of your life, you’re going to have
to decide what it is that you like or don’t like in a wine and communicate that
to another person who can steer you toward a wine you’ll like.
There are two hurdles here: Finding the words to describe what you like or
don’t like, and then getting the other person to understand what you mean.
Naturally, it helps if we all speak the same language.
Unfortunately, Winespeak is a dialect with an undisciplined and sometimes
poetic vocabulary whose definitions change all the time, depending on who’s
speaking. In case you really want to get into this wine thing, we treat you to
some sophisticated wine language in Chapters 5 and 19. For now, a few basic
words and concepts should do the trick.

The sequential palate
The tastes of a wine reveal themselves sequentially as the tongue detects
them, and they register in your brain. We recommend that you follow this
natural sequence when you try to put words to what you’re tasting.
Sweetness
As soon as you put the wine into your mouth, you can usually notice sweet-
ness or the lack of it. In Winespeak, dry is the opposite of sweet. Classify the
wine you’re tasting as either dry, off-dry (in other words, somewhat sweet), or
sweet.
Acidity
All wine contains acid (mainly tartaric acid, which exists in grapes), but some
wines are more acidic than others. Acidity is more of a taste factor in white
wines than in reds. For white wines, acidity is the backbone of the wine’s
taste (it gives the wine firmness in your mouth). White wines with a high
amount of acidity feel crisp, and those without enough acidity feel flabby.
You generally perceive acidity in the middle of your mouth — what wine-
tasters call the mid-palate. You can also sense the consequences of acidity
(or the lack of it) in the overall style of the wine — whether it’s a tart little
number or a soft and generous sort, for example. Classify the wine you’re
tasting as crisp, soft, or “couch potato.”
Tannin
Tannin is a substance that exists naturally in the skins, seeds (or pips), and
stems of grapes. Because red wines are fermented with their grape skins and
pips, and because red grape varieties are generally higher in tannin than
white varieties, tannin levels are far higher in red wines than in white wines.
Oak barrels can also contribute tannin to wines, both reds and whites. Have you
ever taken a sip of a red wine and rapidly experienced a drying-out feeling in
your mouth, as if something had blotted up all your saliva? That’s tannin.
28
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Is it sweetness or fruitiness?
Beginning wine tasters sometimes describe dry
wines as sweet because they confuse fruitiness
with sweetness. A wine is fruity when it has dis-
tinct aromas and flavors of fruit. You smell the
fruitiness with your nose; in your mouth, you
“smell” it through your retronasal passage.
Sweetness, on the other hand, is a tactile
impression on your tongue. When in doubt, try
holding your nose when you taste the wine; if
the wine really is sweet, you’ll be able to taste
the sweetness despite the fact that you can’t
smell the fruitiness.

To generalize a bit, tannin is to a red wine what acidity is to a white: a back-
bone. Tannins alone can taste bitter, but some tannins in wine are less bitter
than others. Also, other elements of the wine, such as sweetness, can mask
the perception of bitterness (see “Balance” later in this chapter). You sense
tannin — as bitterness, or as firmness or richness of texture — mainly in the
rear of your mouth and, if the amount of tannin in a wine is high, on the
inside of your cheeks and on your gums. Depending on the amount and
nature of its tannin, you can describe a red wine as astringent, firm, or soft.
Body
A wine’s body is an impression you get from the whole of the wine — not a
basic taste that registers on your tongue. It’s the impression of the weight
and size of the wine in your mouth, which is usually attributable principally
to a wine’s alcohol. We say “impression” because, obviously, one ounce of
any wine will occupy exactly the same space in your mouth and weigh the
same as one ounce of any other wine. But some wines seem fuller, bigger, or
heavier in the mouth than others. Think about the wine’s fullness and weight
as you taste it. Imagine that your tongue is a tiny scale and judge how much
the wine is weighing it down. Classify the wine as light-bodied, medium-bodied,
or full-bodied.
The flavor dimension
Wines have flavors (er, we mean mouth aromas), but wines don’t come in
a specific flavor. While you may enjoy the suggestion of chocolate in a red
wine that you’re tasting, you wouldn’t want to go to a wine store and ask for
a chocolaty wine, unless you don’t mind the idea of people holding their
hands over their mouths and trying not to laugh aloud at you.
29
Chapter 2: These Taste Buds Are for You
Touchy-feely
Softness and firmness are actually textural
impressions a wine gives you as you taste it.
Just as your mouth feels temperature in a liquid,
it feels texture. Some wines literally feel soft and
smooth as they move through your mouth, while
others feel hard, rough, or coarse. In white wines,
acid is usually responsible for impressions of
hardness or firmness (or crispness); in red wines,
tannin is usually responsible. Low levels of
either substance can make a wine feel pleas-
antly soft — or too soft, depending on the wine
and your taste preferences. Unfermented sugar
also contributes to an impression of softness,
and alcohol can, too. But very high alcohol —
which is fairly common in wines these days —
can give a wine an edge of hardness.

Instead, you should refer to families of flavors in wine. You have your fruity
wines (the ones that make you think of all sorts of fruit when you smell them
or taste them), your earthy wines (these make you think of minerals and
rocks, walks in the forest, turning the earth in your garden, dry leaves, and so
on), your spicy wines (cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, or Indian spices, for
example), your herbal wines (mint, grass, hay, rosemary, and so on), and so
on, and so on. There are so many flavors in wine that we could go on and on
(and we often do!), but you get the picture, don’t you?
If you like a wine and want to try another wine that’s similar but different
(and it will always be different, we guarantee you), one method is to decide
what families of flavors in the wine you like and mention that to the person
selling you your next bottle. In Parts III, IV and V, you’ll find wines that fit
these specific flavors. 
Another aspect of flavor that’s important to consider is a wine’s flavor
intensity — how much flavor the wine has, regardless of what those flavors
are. Some wines are as flavorful as a Big Mac, while others have flavors as
subtle as fillet of sole. Flavor intensity is a major factor in pairing wine with
food, as you can read in Chapter 19, and it also helps determine how much
you like a wine.
The Quality Issue
Did you notice, by any chance, that nowhere among the terms we use to
describe wines are the words great, very good, or good? Instead of worrying
about crisp wines, earthy wines, and medium-bodied wines, wouldn’t it just
be easier to walk into a wine shop and say, “Give me a very good wine for
dinner tonight”? Isn’t quality the ultimate issue — or at least, quality within
your price range, also known as value?
30
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Is it acid or tannin?
Red wines have acid as well as tannin, and dis-
tinguishing between the two as you taste a wine
can be a real challenge. When you’re not sure
whether it’s mainly tannin or acid you’re 
perceiving, pay attention to how your mouth feels
afteryou’ve swallowed the wine. Acid makes you
salivate (saliva is alkaline, and it flows to neu-
tralize the acid). Tannin leaves your mouth dry.

Wine producers constantly brag about the quality ratings that their wines
receive from critics, because a high rating — implying high quality — translates
into increased sales for a wine. But quality wines come in all colors, degrees of
sweetness and dryness, and flavor profiles. Just because a wine is high quality
doesn’t mean that you will actually enjoy it, any more than two-thumbs-up
means that you’ll love a particular movie. We’ve purchased highly rated wines
and ended up pouring them down the sink because we didn’t care to drink
them. Personal taste is simply more relevant than quality in choosing a wine.
Nevertheless, degrees of quality do exist among wines. But a wine’s quality is
not absolute: how great a wine is or isn’t depends on who is doing the judging.
The instruments that measure the quality of a wine are a human being’s nose
mouth, and brain, and because we’re all different, we all have different opinions
on how good a wine is. The combined opinion of a group of trained, experienced
palates (also known as wine experts) is usually considered a definitive judgment
of a wine’s quality. (Turn to Chapter 19 for more about expert opinion.)
What’s a good wine?
A good wine is, above all, a wine that you like enough to drink — because the
whole purpose of a wine is to give pleasure to those who drink it. After that,
how good a wine is depends on how it measures up to a set of (more or less)
agreed-upon standards of performance established by experienced, trained
experts. These standards involve mysterious concepts like balance, length,
depth, complexity, and trueness to type (typicity in Winespeak, typicité in
Snobwinespeak). None of these concepts is objectively measurable, by the way.
Balance
Three words we talk about in the “Parlez-Vous Winespeak?” section in this
chapter — sweetness, acidity, and tannin — represent three of the major 
components (parts) of wine. The fourth is alcohol. Besides being one of the
reasons we usually want to drink a glass of wine in the first place, alcohol is
an important element of wine quality.
Balance is the relationship of these four components to one another. A wine
is balanced when nothing sticks out as you taste it, like harsh tannin or too
much sweetness. Most wines are balanced to most people. But if you have
any pet peeves about food — if you really hate anything tart, for example,
or if you never eat sweets — you may perceive some wines to be unbalanced.
If you perceive them to be unbalanced, then they are unbalanced for you.
(Professional tasters know their own idiosyncrasies and adjust for them
when they judge wine.)
31
Chapter 2: These Taste Buds Are for You

Tannin and acidity are hardening elements in a wine (they make a wine taste
firmer in the mouth), while alcohol and sugar (if any) are softening elements.
The balance of a wine is the interrelationship of the hard and the soft aspects
of a wine, and a key indicator of quality.
Length
When we call wines long or short, we’re not referring to the size of the bottle or
how quickly we empty it. Length is a word used to describe a wine that gives
an impression of going all the way on the palate — you can taste it across the
full length of your tongue — rather than stopping short halfway through your
tasting of it. Many wines today are very up front on the palate — they make a
big impression as soon as you taste them — but they don’t go the distance in
your mouth. They are short. Generally, high alcohol or excess tannin is to blame.
Length is a sure sign of high quality.
Depth
This is another subjective, unmeasurable attribute of a high-quality wine.
We say a wine has depth when it seems to have a dimension of verticality —
that is, it does not taste flat and one-dimensional in your mouth. A “flat” wine
can never be great.
Complexity
There’s nothing wrong with a simple, straightforward wine, especially if you
enjoy it. But a wine that keeps revealing different things about itself, always
showing you a new flavor or impression — a wine that has complexity — is
usually considered better quality. Some experts use the term complexity
specifically to indicate that a wine has a multiplicity of aromas and flavors,
while others use it in a more holistic (but less precise) sense, to refer to the
total impression a wine gives you.
32
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Taste is personal
Literally! The perception of the basic tastes on
the tongue varies from one person to the next.
Research has proven that some people have
more taste buds than others, and are therefore
more sensitive to characteristics such as sour-
ness or bitterness in food and beverages. The
most sensitive tasters are called, somewhat
misleadingly, “supertasters” — not because
they are more expert, but because they per-
ceive sensations such as bitterness more acutely.
If you find diet sodas very bitter, or if you need to
add a lot of sugar to your coffee to make it palat-
able, you may fall into this category — and you
therefore may find many red wines unpleasant,
even if other people consider them great.

Finish
The impression a wine leaves in the back of your mouth and in your throat
after you have swallowed it is its finish or aftertaste. In a good wine, you can
still perceive the wine’s flavors — such as fruitiness or spiciness — at that
point. Some wines may finish hot, because of high alcohol, or bitter, because
of tannin — both shortcomings. Or a wine may have nothing much at all to
say for itself after you swallow.
Typicity
In order to judge whether a wine is true to its type, you have to know how that
type is supposed to taste. So you have to know the textbook characteristics
of wines made from the major grape varieties and wines of the world’s classic
wine regions. (For example, the Cabernet Sauvignon grape typically has an
aroma and flavor of blackcurrants, and the French white wine called Pouilly-
Fumé typically has a slight gunflint aroma.) Turn to Chapter 3 and Chapters 9
through 15 for all those details.
What’s a bad wine?
Strangely enough, the right to declare a wine “good” because you like it does
not carry with it the right to call a wine “bad” just because you don’t. In this
game, you get to make your own rules, but you don’t get to force other people
to live by them.
The fact is there are very few bad wines in the world today compared to even
20 years ago. And many of the wines we could call bad are actually just bad
bottles of wine — bottles that were handled badly, so that the good wine inside
them got ruined.
33
Chapter 2: These Taste Buds Are for You
Balance in action
For firsthand experience of how the principle of
taste balance works, try this. Make a very strong
cup of tea, and chill it. When you sip it, the cold
tea will taste bitter, because it’s very tannic.
Now add lemon juice; the tea will taste astrin-
gent (constricting the pores in your mouth),
because the acid of the lemon and the tannin of
the tea are accentuating each other. Now add
a lot of sugar to the tea. The sweetness should
counter-balance the acid–tannin impact, and
the tea will taste softer than it did before.

Here are some characteristics that everyone agrees indicate a bad wine. We
hope you never meet one.
 Moldy fruit: Have you ever eaten a raspberry from the bottom of the
container that had a dusty, cardboardy taste to it? That same taste of
rot can be in a wine if the wine was made from grapes that were not
completely fresh and healthy when they were harvested. Bad wine.
 Vinegar: In the natural evolution of things, wine is just a passing stage
between grape juice and vinegar. Most wines today remain forever in the
wine stage because of technology or careful winemaking. If you find a
wine that has crossed the line toward vinegar, it’s bad wine.
 Chemical or bacterial smells: The most common are acetone (nail
polish thinner) and sulfur flaws (rotten eggs, burnt rubber, bad garlic).
Bad wines.
 Oxidized wine: This wine smells flat, weak, or maybe cooked, and it
tastes the same. It may have been a good wine once, but air — oxygen —
got in somehow and killed the wine. Bad bottle.
 Cooked aromas and taste: When a wine has been stored or shipped in
heat, it can actually taste cooked or baked as a result. Often there’s tell-
tale leakage from the cork, or the cork has pushed up a bit. Bad bottle.
(Unfortunately, every other bottle of that wine that experienced the
same shipping or storage will also be bad.)
 Corky wine: The most common flaw, corkiness comes across as a smell of
damp cardboard that gets worse with air, and a diminished flavor intensity.
It’s caused by a bad cork, and any wine in a bottle that’s sealed with a
cork is at risk for it. Bad bottle.
The Final Analysis: Do You Like It?
Let’s not dwell too long on what can go wrong with a wine. If you find a bad
wine or a bad bottle — or even a wine that is considered a good wine, but
you don’t like it — just move on to something you like better. Drinking a so-
called great wine that you don’t enjoy is as stupid as watching a television
show that bores you. Change the channel. Explore.

W
e love to visit wine country. Gazing across manicured rows of grapevines
in Napa Valley or pondering craggy terraces of rugged hillside vines in
Portugal inspires us — and reinforces for us the fact that wine is an agricul-
tural product, born of the earth, the grapevine, and the hard work of humans.
Literally and emotionally, grapes are the link between the land and the wine.
Grapes also happen to give us one of the easiest ways of classifying wine and
making sense of the hundreds of different types of wine that exist.
Why Grapes Matter
Grapes are the starting point of every wine, and therefore they are largely
responsible for the style and personality of each wine. The grapes that make
a particular wine dictate the genetic structure of that wine and how it will
respond to everything that the winemaker does to it.
Think back to the last wine you drank. What color was it? If it was white, the
odds are that’s because it came from white grapes; if it was pink or red, that’s
because the wine came from red grapes.
Did it smell herbal or earthy or fruity? Whichever, those aromas came mainly
from the grapes. Was it firm and tannic or soft and voluptuous? Thank the
grapes — with a nod to Mother Nature and the winemaker.

The specific grape variety (or varieties) that makes any given wine is largely
responsible for the sensory characteristics the wine offers — from its appear-
ance to its aromas, its flavors, and its alcohol–tannin–acid profile. How the
grapes grow — the amount of sunshine and moisture they get, for example,
and how ripe they are when they’re harvested — can emphasize certain of
their characteristics rather than others. So can winemaking processes such
as oak aging (see Chapter 5). Each grape variety reacts in its own way to the
farming and winemaking techniques that it faces.
Of genus and species
By grape variety, we mean the fruit of a specific type of grapevine: the fruit of
the Cabernet Sauvignon vine, for example, or of the Chardonnay vine.
The term variety actually has specific meaning in scientific circles. A variety
is a subdivision of a species. Most of the world’s wines are made from grape
varieties that belong to the species vinifera — itself a subdivision of the
genus Vitis. This species originated in Europe and western Asia; other distinct
species of Vitis are native to North America.
Grapes of other species can also make wine; for example, the Concord grape,
which makes Concord wine as well as grape juice and jelly, belongs to the
native American species Vitis labrusca. But the grapes of this species have a
very different flavor from vinifera grapes — foxy is the word used to describe
that taste. The number of non-vinifera wines is small because their flavor is
less popular in wine.
A variety of varieties
Snowflakes and fingerprints aren’t the only examples of Nature’s infinite 
variety. Within the genus Vitis and the species vinifera, there are as many as
10,000 varieties of wine grapes. If wine from every one of these varieties were
commercially available and you drank the wine of a different variety every
single day, it would take you more than 27 years to experience them all!
Not that you would want to. Within those 10,000 varieties are grapes that
have the ability to make extraordinary wine, grapes that tend to make very
ordinary wine, and grapes that only a parent could love. Most varieties are
obscure grapes whose wines rarely enter into international commerce.
An extremely adventuresome grape nut who has plenty of free time to explore
the back roads of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece might be able to encounter
1,500 different grape varieties (only four years’ worth of drinking) in his lifetime.
The grape varieties you might encounter in the course of your normal wine
enjoyment probably number fewer than 50.
36
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

How grapes vary
All sorts of attributes distinguish each grape variety from the next. These
attributes fall into two categories: personality traits and performance factors.
Personality traits are the characteristics of the fruit itself — its flavors, for
example. Performance factors refer to how the grapevine grows, how its fruit
ripens, and how quickly it can get from 0 to 60 miles per hour.
Personality traits of grape varieties
Skin color is the most fundamental distinction among grape varieties. Every
grape variety is considered either a white variety or a red (or “black”) one,
according to the color of its skins when the grapes are ripe. (A few red-skinned
varieties are further distinguished by having red pulp rather than white pulp.)
Individual grape varieties also differ from one another in other ways:
 Aromatic compounds: Some grapes (like Muscat) contribute floral
aromas and flavors to their wine, for example, while other grapes con-
tribute herbaceous notes (as Sauvignon Blanc does) or fruity character.
Some grapes have very neutral aromas and flavors and, therefore, make
fairly neutral wines.
 Acidity levels: Some grapes are naturally disposed to higher acid levels
than others, which influences the wine made from those grapes.
 Thickness of skin and size of the individual grapes (called berries):
Black grapes with thick skins naturally have more tannin than grapes
with thin skins; ditto for small-berried varieties compared to large-berried
varieties, because their skin-to-juice ratio is higher. More tannin in the
grapes translates into a firmer, more tannic red wine.
37
Chapter 3: Pinot Envy and Other Secrets about Grape Varieties
The phylloxera threat
If endangered species lists had existed at the end
of the nineteenth century, Vitis vinifera certainly
would’ve been on them. The entire species was
nearly eradicated by a tiny louse called phylloxera
that immigrated to Europe from America and pro-
ceeded to feast on the roots of vinifera grapevines,
wiping out vineyards across the continent.
To this day, no remedy has been found to pro-
tect vinifera roots from phylloxera. What saved
the species was grafting vinifera vines onto
rootstocks of native American species that are
resistant to the bug. The practice of grafting the
fruit-bearing part of Vitis vinifera onto the root-
ing part of other, phylloxera-resistant species
continues today everywhere in the world where
phylloxera is present and fine wine is made.
(The fruit-bearing part is called a scion, and the
rooting plant is called a rootstock.) Miraculously,
each grape variety maintains its own character
despite the fact that its roots are alien.

The composite personality traits of any grape variety are fairly evident in
wines made from that grape. A Cabernet Sauvignon wine is almost always
more tannic and slightly lower in alcohol than a comparable Merlot wine, for
example, because that’s the nature of those two grapes.
Performance factors of grape varieties
The performance factors that distinguish grape varieties are vitally important
to the grape grower because those factors determine how easy or challenging
it will be for him to cultivate a specific variety in his vineyard — if he can
even grow it at all. The issues include
 How much time a variety typically needs to ripen its grapes. (In regions
with short growing seasons, early-ripening varieties do best.)
 How dense and compact the bunches of grapes are. (In warm, damp 
climates, grape varieties with dense bunches can have mildew 
problems.)
 How much vegetation a particular variety tends to grow. (In fertile soils,
a vine that’s disposed to growing a lot of leaves and shoots can have so
much vegetation that the grapes don’t get enough sun to ripen.)
The reasons some grape varieties perform brilliantly in certain places (and
make excellent wine as a result) are so complex that grape growers haven’t
figured them all out yet. The amount of heat and cold, the amount of wind
and rain (or lack of it), and the slant of the sun’s rays on a hillside of vines are
among the factors affecting a vine’s performance. In any case, no two vine-
yards in the world have precisely the same combination of these factors —
precisely the same terroir (see Chapter 4). The issue simply defies simple
generalizations.
38
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
How grapes ripen
When grapes are not yet ripe, they contain high
amounts of acid and very little sugar — which is
true for any fruit — and their flavor is tart. As
ripening progresses, they become sweeter and
less acidic (although they always retain some
acid), and their flavors become richer and more
complex. Their skins get thinner, and even their
seeds and stems “ripen,” sometimes changing
color from green to brown. In red grape vari-
eties, the tannin in the skins, stems, and pips
becomes richer and less astringent. The stage
of ripeness that the grapes attain is a big factor
in the style of the wine.

Grape royalty and commoners
Bees have their queens, gorillas have their silverbacks, and humans have
their royal families. In the grape kingdom, there are nobles, too — at least as
interpreted by the human beings who drink the wine made from those grapes.
Noble grape varieties (as wine people call them) have the potential to make
great — not just good — wine. Every noble grape variety can claim at least
one wine region where it’s the undisputed king. The wines made from noble
grapes on their home turf can be so great that they inspire winemakers in 
far-flung regions to grow the same grape in their own vineyards. The noble
grape might prove itself noble there, too — but frequently the grape does
not. Adaptability isn’t a prerequisite of nobility.
Classic examples of noble grape varieties at their best are
 The Chardonnay grape and the Pinot Noir grape in Burgundy, France
 The Cabernet Sauvignon grape in Bordeaux, France
 The Syrah grape in France’s Northern Rhône Valley
 The Chenin Blanc grape in France’s Loire Valley
 The Nebbiolo grape in Piedmont, Italy
 The Sangiovese grape in Tuscany, Italy
 The Riesling grape in the Mosel and Rheingau regions of Germany
39
Chapter 3: Pinot Envy and Other Secrets about Grape Varieties
Chardonnay, do you take this limestone soil?
One important factor in how a grape variety per-
forms is the soil in the vineyard. Over the cen-
turies, some classic compatibilities between
grape varieties and types of soil have become
evident: Chardonnay in limestone or chalk,
Cabernet Sauvignon in gravelly soil, Pinot Noir in
limestone, and Riesling in slatey soil. At any rate,
these are the soils of the regions where these
grape varieties perform at their legendary best.
Soil affects a grapevine in several ways
(besides simply anchoring the vine): It provides
nutrition for the grapevine; it can influence the
temperature of the vineyard; and it’s a water-
management system for the plant.
A safe generalization is that the best soils are
those that have good drainage and aren’t partic-
ularly fertile. (An extreme example is the soil — if
we can call it that — of the Châteauneuf-du-Pape
district in France’s Rhône Valley: It’s just stones.)
The wisdom of the ages dictates that the grape-
vine must struggle to produce the best grapes,
and well-drained, less fertile soils challenge the
vine to struggle, regardless of what variety the
grapevine is.

A Primer on White Grape Varieties
This section includes descriptions of the 12 most important white vinifera
varieties today. In describing the grapes, naturally we describe the types of
wine that are made from each grape. These wines can be varietal wines, or
place-name wines that don’t mention the grape variety anywhere on the label
(a common practice for European wines; see Chapter 4). These grapes can
also be blending partners for other grapes, in wines made from multiple grape
varieties. (Turn to Chapter 2 for a quick review of some of the descriptors we
use in this section.)
Chardonnay
Chardonnay is a regal grape for its role in producing the greatest dry white
wines in the world — white Burgundies — and for being one of the main grapes
of Champagne. Today it also ends up in a huge amount of everyday wine.
The Chardonnay grape grows in practically every wine-producing country of the
world, for two reasons: It’s relatively adaptable to a wide range of climates;
and the name Chardonnay on a wine label is, these days, a surefire sales tool.
40
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Cloning the perfect grapevine
Hang around wine people long enough, and
you’re sure to hear them talk about clones or
clonal selection of grape varieties. Has the
Brave New World of grape growing arrived?
Not really. In botanical terms, a clone is a sub-
division of a variety. Within a single variety, such
as Chardonnay, differences can exist from one
plant to the next. Some vines might ripen their
fruit slightly more quickly, for example, or pro-
duce grapes with slightly different aromas and
flavors than the next vine.
Nurseries propagate grapevines asexually, by
taking cuttings from a mother plant and allowing
those cuttings to root (until the new plant is
mature enough to be grafted onto a phylloxera-
resistant rootstock). The new plants are genet-
ically identical to the mother plant. Naturally,
grape growers choose from the nursery the
most ideal plants for their situation (in terms of
ripening, fruit flavor, disease resistance, hearti-
ness — or whatever it is they’re looking for).
Voilá! They’ve made a clonal selection.
Increasingly, growers plant their vineyards with
several different clones to foster complexity.

Because the flavors of Chardonnay are very compatible with those of oak —
and because white Burgundy (the great prototype) is generally an oaked wine,
and because many wine drinkers love the flavor of oak — most Chardonnay
wine receives some oak treatment either during or after fermentation. (For the
best Chardonnays, oak treatment means expensive barrels of French oak; but
for lower-priced Chardonnays it could mean soaking oak chips in the wine or
even adding liquid essence of oak. See Chapter 5 for more on oak.) Except for
Northeastern Italy and France’s Chablis and Mâconnais districts, where oak
is usually not used for Chardonnay, oaky Chardonnay wine is the norm and
unoaked Chardonnay is the exception.
Oaked Chardonnay is so common that some wine drinkers confuse the flavor
of oak with the flavor of Chardonnay. If your glass of Chardonnay smells or
tastes toasty, smoky, spicy, vanilla-like, or butterscotch-like, that’s the oak
you’re perceiving, not the Chardonnay!
Chardonnay itself has fruity aromas and flavors that range from apple —
in cooler wine regions — to tropical fruits, especially pineapple, in warmer
regions. Chardonnay also can display subtle earthy aromas, such as mushroom
or minerals. Chardonnay wine has medium to high acidity and is generally
full-bodied. Classically, Chardonnay wines are dry. But most inexpensive
Chardonnays these days are actually a bit sweet.
Chardonnay is a grape that can stand on its own in a wine, and the top
Chardonnay-based wines (except for Champagne and similar bubblies)
are 100 percent Chardonnay. But less expensive wines that are labeled
Chardonnay — those selling for less than $10 a bottle in the United States,
for example — are likely to have some other, far less distinguished grape
blended in, to help reduce the cost of making the wine. Anyway, who can
even tell, behind all that oak?
Riesling
The great Riesling wines of Germany have put the Riesling grape on the
charts as an undisputedly noble variety. Riesling shows its real class only 
in a few places outside of Germany, however. The Alsace region of France,
Austria, and the Clare Valley region of Australia are among the few.
Riesling wines are far less popular today than Chardonnay. Maybe that’s
because Riesling is the antithesis of Chardonnay. While Chardonnay is usu-
ally gussied up with oak, Riesling almost never is; while Chardonnay can be
full-bodied and rich, Riesling is more often light-bodied, crisp, and refreshing.
Riesling’s fresh, vivid personality can make many Chardonnays taste clumsy
in comparison.
41
Chapter 3: Pinot Envy and Other Secrets about Grape Varieties

The common perception of Riesling wines is that they’re sweet, and many of
them are — but plenty of them aren’t. Alsace Rieslings are normally dry, many
German Rieslings are fairly dry, and a few American Rieslings are dry. (Riesling
can be vinified either way, according to the style of wine a producer wants to
make.) Look for the word trocken (meaning dry) on German Riesling labels
and the word dry on American labels if you prefer the dry style of Riesling.
High acidity, low to medium alcohol levels, and aromas/flavors that range
from ebulliently fruity to flowery to minerally are trademarks of Riesling.
Riesling wines are sometimes labeled as White Riesling or Johannisberg
Riesling — both synonyms for the noble Riesling grape. With wines from
Eastern European countries, though, read the fine print: Olazrizling,
Laskirizling, and Welschriesling are from another grape altogether.
If you consider yourself a maverick who hates to follow trends, check out the
Riesling section of your wine shop instead of the Chardonnay aisle.
Sauvignon Blanc
Sauvignon Blanc is a white variety with a very distinctive character. It’s high
in acidity with pronounced aromas and flavors. Besides herbaceous charac-
ter (sometimes referred to as grassy), Sauvignon Blanc wines display mineral
aromas and flavors, vegetal character, or — in certain climates — fruity 
character, such as ripe melon, figs, or passion fruit. The wines are light- to
medium-bodied and usually dry. Most of them are unoaked, but some are oaky.
42
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Aliases and a.k.a.’s
The same grape variety will often go by different
names in different countries or even in different
districts within the same country. Often it’s just
a case of traditional local synonyms. But some-
times, grape growers call one variety by the
name of another because they think that’s what
they’re growing (until a specialized botanist
called an ampelographer examines their vines
and tells them otherwise). In California, for exam-
ple, some of the so-called Pinot Blanc has turned
out to be another grape entirely: Melon de
Bourgogne. In Chile, much of what grape grow-
ers call Merlot is really the Carmenère grape —
while in the Friuli region of Italy, some of what
is called Cabernet Franc is actually Carmenère.
For more tales of viticultural intrigue, read Jancis
Robinson’s classic book on grape varieties,
Vines, Grapes and Wines (Alfred A. Knopf), an
indispensable and fascinating reference.

France has two classic wine regions for the Sauvignon Blanc grape: Bordeaux;
and the Loire Valley, where the two best known Sauvignon wines are called
Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé (described in Chapter 9). In Bordeaux, Sauvignon
Blanc is sometimes blended with Sémillon (described in Table 3-1); some of
the wines that are blended about fifty-fifty from the two grapes and fermented
in oak are among the great white wines of the world.
Sauvignon Blanc is also important in Northeastern Italy, South Africa, and
parts of California, where the wines are sometimes labeled as “Fumé Blanc.”
New Zealand’s Sauvignon Blanc wines in particular are renowned for their
fresh, flavorful style.
Pinot Gris/Pinot Grigio
Pinot Gris (gree) is one of several grape varieties called Pinot: There’s Pinot
Blanc (white Pinot), Pinot Noir (black Pinot), Pinot Meunier (we don’t know
how that one translates), and Pinot Gris (gray Pinot), which is called Pinot
Grigio in Italian. Pinot Gris is believed to have mutated from the black Pinot
Noir grape. Although it’s considered a white grape, its skin color is unusually
dark for a white variety.
Wines made from Pinot Gris can be deeper in color than most white wines —
although most of Italy’s Pinot Grigio wines are quite pale. Pinot Gris wines are
medium- to full-bodied, usually not oaky, and have rather low acidity and
fairly neutral aromas. Sometimes the flavor and aroma can suggest the skins
of fruit, such as peach skins or orange rind.
Pinot Gris is an important grape throughout Northeastern Italy and also
grows in Germany, where it is called Ruländer. The only region in France
where Pinot Gris is important is in Alsace, where it really struts its stuff.
Oregon has had good success with Pinot Gris, and more and more winemak-
ers in California are now taking a shot at it. Because Pinot Grigio is one of the
best-selling inexpensive white wine in the United States, countries such as
Chile and Australia now grow this grape for mass-market wines, and they
often call the wine “Pinot Grigio.”
Other white grapes
Table 3-1 describes some other grapes whose names you see on wine labels,
or whose wine you could drink in place-name wines without realizing it.

Albariño
An aromatic grape from the northwestern corner of Spain —

Verde region, where it’s called Alvarinho. It makes medium-

whose high glycerin gives them silky texture.
Chenin Blanc
A noble grape in the Loire Valley of France, for Vouvray and
other wines. The best wines have high acidity and a fascinating
oily texture (they feel rather viscous in your mouth). Some good
dry Chenin Blanc comes from California, but so does a ton of
ordinary off-dry wine. In South Africa, Chenin Blanc is often
called Steen.
Gewürztraminer 
A wonderfully exotic grape that makes fairly deep-colored, full-

lychee fruit. France’s Alsace region is the classic domain of this
variety; the wines have pronounced floral and fruity aromas and
flavors, but are actually dry — as fascinating as they are deli-
cious. A commercial style of U.S. Gewürztraminer is light,
sweetish, and fairly insipid, but a few wineries in California,
Oregon, and New York do make good, dry Gewürztraminer.
Grüner Veltliner
A native Austrian variety that boasts complex aromas and 
flavors (vegetal, spicy, mineral), rich texture, and usually 
substantial weight.
Muscat
An aromatic grape that makes Italy’s sparkling Asti (which, inci-
dentally, tastes exactly like ripe Muscat grapes). Extremely pretty
floral aromas. In Alsace and Austria, makes a dry wine, and in
lots of places (southern France, southern Italy, Australia) makes
a delicious, sweet dessert wine through the addition of alcohol.
Pinot Blanc
Fairly neutral in aroma and flavors, yet can make characterful
wines. High acidity and low sugar levels translate into dry, crisp,
medium-bodied wines. Alsace, Austria, northern Italy, and
Germany are the main production zones.
Sémillon 
Sauvignon Blanc’s classic blending partner and a good grape in 
(seh-mee-yohn)
its own right. Sémillon wine is low in acid relative to Sauvignon
Blanc and has attractive but subtle aromas — lanolin sometimes,
although it can be slightly herbaceous when young. A major
grape in Australia, and southwestern France, including Bordeaux
(where it is the key player in the dessert wine, Sauternes).
Viognier 
A grape from France’s Rhône Valley that’s becoming popular in 
(vee-ohn-yay)
California, the south of France and elsewhere. Floral aroma, del-
icately apricot-like, medium- to full-bodied with low acidity.

A Primer on Red Grape Varieties
Here are descriptions of 12 important red vinifera grape varieties. You’ll
encounter these grapes in varietal wines and also in place-name wines. See
Chapter 4 for a chart listing the grape varieties of major place-name wines.
Cabernet Sauvignon
Cabernet Sauvignon is a noble grape variety that grows well in just about any
climate that isn’t very cool. It became famous through the age-worthy red wines
of the Médoc district of Bordeaux (which usually also contain Merlot and
Cabernet Franc, in varying proportions; see Chapter 9). But today California is an
equally important region for Cabernet Sauvignon — not to mention Washington,
southern France, Italy, Australia, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, and so on.
The Cabernet Sauvignon grape makes wines that are high in tannin and are
medium- to full-bodied. The textbook descriptor for Cabernet Sauvignon’s
aroma and flavor is blackcurrants or cassis; the grape can also contribute veg-
etal tones to a wine when or where the grapes are less than ideally ripe.
Cabernet Sauvignon wines come in all price and quality levels. The least-
expensive versions are usually fairly soft and very fruity, with medium body.
The best wines are rich and firm with great depth and classic Cabernet flavor.
Serious Cabernet Sauvignons can age for 15 years or more.
Because Cabernet Sauvignon is fairly tannic (and because of the blending
precedent in Bordeaux), winemakers often blend it with other grapes; usually
Merlot — being less tannic — is considered an ideal partner. Australian wine-
makers have an unusual practice of blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Syrah.
(More on that in Chapter 12.)
Cabernet Sauvignon often goes by just its first name, Cabernet (although it
isn’t the only Cabernet) or even by its nickname, Cab.
Merlot
Deep color, full body, high alcohol, and low tannin are the characteristics of
wines made from the Merlot grape. The aromas and flavors can be plummy or
sometimes chocolatey, or they can suggest tea leaves.
Some wine drinkers find Merlot easier to like than Cabernet Sauvignon because
it’s less tannic. (But some winemakers feel that Merlot isn’t satisfactory in its
own right, and thus often blend it with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc,
or both.) Merlot makes both inexpensive, simple wines and, when grown in
the right conditions, very serious wines.
45
Chapter 3: Pinot Envy and Other Secrets about Grape Varieties

Merlot is actually the most-planted grape variety in Bordeaux, where it excels
in the Right Bank districts of Pomerol and St. Emilion. Merlot is also impor-
tant in Washington, California, the Long Island district of New York,
Northeastern Italy, and Chile.
Pinot Noir
The late Andre Tchelitscheff, the legendary winemaker of some of California’s
finest Cabernets, once told us that if he could do it all over again, he’d make
Pinot Noir instead of Cab. He’s probably not alone. Cabernet is the sensible
wine to make — a good, steady, reliable wine that doesn’t give the winemaker
too much trouble and can achieve excellent quality — and Pinot Noir is finicky,
troublesome, enigmatic, and challenging. But a great Pinot Noir can be one of
the greatest wines ever.
The prototype for Pinot Noir wine is red Burgundy, from France, where tiny
vineyard plots yield rare treasures of wine made entirely from Pinot Noir.
Oregon, California, New Zealand, and parts of Australia and Chile also pro-
duce good Pinot Noir. But Pinot Noir’s production is rather limited, because
this variety is very particular about climate and soil.
Pinot Noir wine is lighter in color than Cabernet or Merlot. It has relatively
high alcohol, medium-to-high acidity, and medium-to-low tannin (although oak
barrels can contribute additional tannin to the wine). Its flavors and aromas
can be very fruity — often like a mélange of red berries — or earthy and
woodsy, depending on how it is grown and/or vinified. Pinot Noir is rarely
blended with other grapes.
Syrah/Shiraz
The northern part of France’s Rhône Valley is the classic home for great wines
from the Syrah grape. Rhône wines such as Hermitage and Côte-Rôtie are the
inspiration for Syrah’s dissemination to Australia, California, Washington, Italy,
and Spain.
Syrah produces deeply colored wines with full body, firm tannin, and
aromas/flavors that can suggest berries, smoked meat, black pepper, tar,
or even burnt rubber (believe it or not). In Australia, Syrah (called Shiraz)
comes in several styles — some of them charming, medium-bodied, vibrantly
fruity wines that are quite the opposite of the Northern Rhône’s powerful
Syrahs. Turn to Chapter 12 for more on Shiraz.
Syrah doesn’t require any other grape to complement its flavors, although in
Australia it is often blended with Cabernet, and in the Southern Rhône it is
often part of a blended wine with Grenache and other varieties.

Zinfandel
White Zinfandel is such a popular wine — and so much better known than
the red style of Zinfandel — that its fans might argue that Zinfandel is a white
grape. But it’s really red.
Zinfandel is one of the oldest grapes in California, and it therefore enjoys
a certain stature there. Its aura is enhanced by its mysterious history:
Although Zinfandel is clearly a vinifera grape, for decades authorities were
uncertain of its origins. They have finally proven that Zinfandel’s origin is an
obscure Croatian grape.
Zin — as lovers of red Zinfandel call it — makes rich, dark wines that are high
in alcohol and medium to high in tannin. They can have a blackberry or rasp-
berry aroma and flavor, a spicy or tarry character, or even a jammy flavor.
Some Zins are lighter than others and meant to be enjoyed young, and some
are serious wines with a tannin structure that’s built for aging. (You can tell
which is which by the price.)
Nebbiolo
Outside of scattered sites in Northwestern Italy — mainly the Piedmont
region — Nebbiolo just doesn’t make remarkable wine. But the extraordinary
quality of Barolo and Barbaresco, two Piedmont wines, prove what greatness
it can achieve under the right conditions.
The Nebbiolo grape is high in both tannin and acid, which can make a wine
tough. Fortunately, it also gives enough alcohol to soften the package. Its color
can be deep when the wine is young but can develop orangey tinges within a
few years. Its complex aroma is fruity (strawberry, cherry), earthy and woodsy
(tar, truffles), herbal (mint, eucalyptus, anise), and floral (roses).
Lighter versions of Nebbiolo are meant to be drunk young — wines labeled
Nebbiolo d’Alba, Roero, or Nebbiolo delle Langhe, for example — while
Barolo and Barbaresco are wines that really deserve a minimum of eight
years’ age before drinking.
Sangiovese
This Italian grape has proven itself in the Tuscany region of Italy, especially in
the Brunello di Montalcino and Chianti districts. Sangiovese makes wines
that are medium to high in acidity and firm in tannin; the wines can be light-
bodied to full-bodied, depending on exactly where the grapes grow and how
the wine is made. The aromas and flavors of the wines are fruity — especially
cherry, often tart cherry — with floral nuances of violets and sometimes a
slightly nutty character.
47
Chapter 3: Pinot Envy and Other Secrets about Grape Varieties

Tempranillo
Tempranillo is Spain’s candidate for greatness. It gives wines deep color, low
acidity, and only moderate alcohol. Modern renditions of Tempranillo from
the Ribera del Duero region and elsewhere in Spain prove what color and
fruitiness this grape has. In more traditional wines, such as those of the Rioja
region, much of the grape’s color and flavor is lost due to long wood aging
and to blending with varieties that lack color, such as Grenache.
Other red grapes
Table 3-2 describes additional red grape varieties and their wines, which you
can encounter either as varietal wines or as wines named for their place of
production.
Table 3-2
Other Red Grapes and Their Characteristics
Grape Type
Characteristics
Aglianico
From Southern Italy, where it makes Taurasi and other age-worthy,
powerful red wines, high in tannin.
Barbera
Italian variety that, oddly for a red grape, has little tannin but very high
acidity. When fully ripe, it can give big, fruity wines with refreshing
crispness. Many producers age the wine in new oak to increase the
tannin level of their wine.
Cabernet 
A parent of Cabernet Sauvignon, and often blended with it to make 
Franc
Bordeaux-style wines. Ripens earlier, and has more expressive, fruitier
flavor (especially berries), as well as less tannin. A specialty of the
Loire Valley in France, where it makes wines with place-names such
as Chinon and Bourgeuil.
Gamay
Excels in the Beaujolais district of France. It makes grapey wines
that can be low in tannin — although the grape itself is fairly tannic.
Neither the grape called Gamay Beaujolais in California nor the
grape called Napa Gamay is true Gamay.
Grenache
A Spanish grape by origin, called Garnacha there. (Most wine drinkers
associate Grenache with France’s southern Rhône Valley more than
with Spain, however.) Sometimes Grenache makes pale, high-alcohol
wines that are dilute in flavor. In the right circumstances, it can make
deeply colored wines with velvety texture and fruity aromas and flavors
suggestive of raspberries.

W
e visit wine stores all the time, not just to shop for dinner but also to
keep an eye on what kinds of wines are hitting the shelves. Never
before have we seen such an astounding proliferation of wine labels! Since
about 2003, it seems that new brands of wine have appeared out of the blue
every week.
All this choice is terrific — or it’s completely paralyzing, depending on how
you approach the situation. One sure way to become more comfortable when
confronted by shelf upon shelf of unfamiliar wine labels is to learn how to
decode the information on those labels. This isn’t difficult to do, because 
regulations specify what can and cannot appear on a label. Master that, and
you’ll be basking in the richness of choices that today’s wine market offers.
The Wine Name Game
All sorts of names appear on wine labels. These names often include
 The name of the grape from which the wine was made.
 A brand name, which is traditionally the name of the company or person
that made the wine (who is called the producer), but for less expensive
wines is likely to be an invented name.
 Sometimes a special, fanciful name for that particular wine (called a 
proprietary name).
 The name of the place, or places, where the grapes grew (the wine
region, and sometimes the name of the specific vineyard property).

Then there’s the vintage year (the year the grapes for that wine grew), which
is part of the wine’s identity; and sometimes you see a descriptor like reserve,
which either has specific legal meaning or means nothing at all, depending on
where the wine came from.
Is it a grape? Is it a place?
Most of the wines that you find in your wine shop or on restaurant wine lists
are named in one of two basic ways: either for their grape variety or for the
place where the grapes grew. That information, plus the name of the producer,
becomes the shorthand name we use in talking about the wine.
Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon, for example, is a wine made by Robert
Mondavi Winery and named after the Cabernet Sauvignon grape. Fontodi
Chianti Classico is a wine made by the Fontodi winery and named after the
place called Chianti Classico.
You may recognize some names as grape names (see Chapter 3) and other
names as place-names right off the bat; but if you don’t, don’t panic. That infor-
mation is the kind of thing you can look up. (Chapters 9 through 15 will help.)
Hello, my name is Chardonnay
A varietal wine is a wine that is named after either the principal or the sole
grape variety that makes up the wine.
Each country (and in the United States, some individual states) has laws
that dictate the minimum percentage of the named grape that a wine must
contain if that wine wants to call itself by a grape name. The issue is truth in
advertising.
U.S. federal regulations fix the legal minimum percentage of the named grape
at 75 percent (which means that your favorite California Chardonnay could
have as much as 25 percent of some other grape in it). In Oregon, the minimum
is 90 percent (except for Cabernet, which can be 75 percent). In Australia, it’s
85 percent. And in the countries that form the European Union (EU), the mini-
mum is 85 percent.
Some varietal wines are made entirely from the grape variety for which the
wine is named. There’s no law against that anywhere.
50
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

Most of the time, the labels of varietal wines don’t tell you whether other
grapes are present in the wine, what those grapes are, or the percentage of
the wine that they account for. All you know is that the wine contains at least
the minimum legal percentage of the named variety.
Interestingly, if a wine sold in the United States is named for two or more
grape varieties — it’s a Semillon-Chardonnay, for example — the label must
state the percentages of each, and these percentages must total 100 percent.
Now that’s an honest varietal wine!
Why name a wine after a grape variety?
Grapes are the raw material of a wine. Except for whatever a wine absorbs
from oak barrels (certain aromas and flavors, as well as tannin) and from cer-
tain winemaking processes described in Chapter 5, the juice of the grapes is
what any wine is. So to name a wine after its grape variety is very logical.
Naming a wine for its grape variety is also very satisfying to exacting con-
sumers. Knowing what grape a wine is made from is akin to knowing what
type of oil is in the salad dressing, whether there are any trans-fats in your
bread, and how much egg is in your egg roll.
Most California (and other American) wines carry varietal names. Likewise,
most Australian, South American, and South African wines are named by
using the principal principle. Even some countries that don’t normally name
their wines after grapes, such as France, are jumping on the varietal-name
bandwagon for certain wines that they especially want to sell to Americans.
Varietal currency
A common perception among some wine drinkers is that a varietal wine is
somehow better than a non-varietal wine. Actually, the fact that a wine is
named after its principal grape variety is absolutely no indication of quality.
Hello, my name is Bordeaux
Unlike American wines, most European wines are named for the region where
their grapes grow rather than for the grape variety itself. Many of these
European wines come from precisely the same grape varieties as American
wines (like Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, and so on),
but they don’t say so on the label. Instead, the labels say Burgundy, Bordeaux,
Sancerre, and so on: the place where those grapes grow.
51
Chapter 4: Wine Names and Label Lingo

Is this some nefarious plot to make wine incomprehensible to English-only
wine lovers who have never visited Europe and flunked geography in school?
Au contraire! The European system of naming wines is actually intended to pro-
vide more information about each wine, and more understanding of what’s in the
bottle, than varietal naming does. The only catch is that to harvest this infor-
mation, you have to learn something about the different regions from which
the wines come. (Turn to Chapters 9 through 15 for some of that information.)
Why name a wine after a place?
Grapes, the raw material of wine, have to grow somewhere. Depending on the
type of soil, the amount of sunshine, the amount of rain, the slope of the hill,
and the many other characteristics that each somewhere has, the grapes will
turn out differently. If the grapes are different, the wine is different. Each wine,
therefore, reflects the place where its grapes grow.
In Europe, grape growers/winemakers have had centuries to figure out which
grapes grow best where. They’ve identified most of these grape–location
match-ups and codified them into regulations. Therefore, the name of a
place where grapes are grown in Europe automatically connotes the grape
(or grapes) used to make the wine of that place. The label on the bottle usu-
ally doesn’t tell you the grape (or grapes), though. Which brings us back to
our original question: Is this some kind of nefarious plot to make wine incom-
prehensible to non-Europeans?
The terroir game
Terroir (pronounced ter wahr) is a French word that has no direct translation
in English, so wine people just use the French word, for expediency (not for
snobbery).

There’s no fixed definition of terroir; it’s a concept, and, like most concepts,
people tend to define it more broadly or more narrowly to suit their own
needs. The word itself is based on the French word terre, which means soil;
so some people define terroir as, simply, dirt (as in “Our American dirt is
every bit as good as their French dirt”).

But terroir is really much more complex (and complicated) than just dirt. Terroir
is the combination of immutable natural factors — such as topsoil, subsoil,
climate (sun, rain, wind, and so on), the slope of the hill, and altitude — that
a particular vineyard site has. Chances are that no two vineyards in the entire
world have precisely the same combination of these factors. So we consider
terroir to be the unique combination of natural factors that a particular vine-
yard site has.
Terroir is the guiding principle behind the European concept that wines
should be named after the place they come from (thought we’d gotten off the
track, didn’t you?). The thinking goes like this: The name of the place con-
notes which grapes were used to make the wine of that place (because the
grapes are dictated by regulations), and the place influences the character of
those grapes in its own unique way. Therefore, the most accurate name that a
wine can have is the name of the place where its grapes grew.
It’s not some nefarious plot; it’s just a whole different way of looking at things.
Place-names on American wine labels
France may have invented the concept that wines should be named after
their place of origin, but neither France nor even greater Europe has a
monopoly on the idea. Wine labels from non-European countries also tell
you where a wine comes from — usually by featuring the name of a place
somewhere on the label. But a few differences exist between the European
and non-European systems.
First of all, on an American wine label (or an Australian, Chilean or South
African label, for that matter) you have to go to some effort to find the 
place-name on the label. The place of origin is not the fundamental name
of the wine (as it is for most European wines); the grape usually is.
Second, place-names in the United States mean far less than they do in
Europe. Okay, if the label says Napa Valley, and you’ve visited that area —
and you loved eating at Mustards, and you’d like to spend the rest of your life
in one of those houses atop a hill off the Silverado Trail — Napa Valley will
mean something to you. But legally, the name Napa Valley means only that at
least 85 percent of the grapes came from an area defined by law as the Napa
Valley wine zone. The name Napa Valley does not define the type of wine, nor
does it imply specific grape varieties, the way a European place-name does.
(Good thing the grape name is there, as big as day, on the label.)
Place-names on labels of non-European wines, for the most part, merely pay
lip service to the concept of terroir. In fact, some non-European wine origins
are ridiculously broad. We have to laugh when we think how European wine-
makers must react to all those wine labels that announce a wine’s place of
origin simply as “California.” Great. This label says that this wine comes from a
specific area that is 30 percent larger than the entire country of Italy! Some spe-
cific area! (Italy has more than 300 specific wine zones.)
54
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

When the place on the label is merely California, in fact, that information tells
you next to nothing about where the grapes grew. California’s a big place, and
those grapes could come from just about anywhere. Same thing for all those
Australian wines labeled South Eastern Australia — an area only slightly
smaller than France and Spain combined.
Wines named in other ways
Now and then, you may come across a wine that is named for neither its grape
variety nor its region of origin. Such wines usually fall into three categories:
branded wines, wines with proprietary names, or generic wines.
Branded wines
Most wines have brand names, including those wines that are named after
their grape variety — like Cakebread (brand name) Sauvignon Blanc (grape) —
and those that are named after their region of origin — like Masi (brand name)
Valpolicella (place). These brand names are usually the name of the company
that made the wine, called a winery. Because most wineries make several dif-
ferent wines, the brand name itself is not specific enough to be the actual
name of the wine.
But sometimes a wine has only a brand name. For example, the label says
Salamandre and red French wine but provides little other identification.
Wines that have only a brand name on them, with no indication of grape or
of place — other than the country of production — are generally the most
inexpensive, ordinary wines you can get. If they’re from a European Union
country, they won’t even be vintage dated (that is, there won’t be any indica-
tion of what year the grapes were harvested) because EU law does not entitle
such wines to carry a vintage date.
55
Chapter 4: Wine Names and Label Lingo
Bigger than a breadbasket
When we travel to other countries, we realize
that people in different places have different
ways of perceiving space and distance. If
someone tells us that we’ll find a certain restau-
rant “just up ahead,” for example, we figure it’s
the equivalent of about three blocks away —
but they might mean three miles.
Discussing place-names for European wines can
be just as problematic. Some of the places are as
small as several acres, some are 100 square miles
big, and others are the size of New Jersey. Certain
words used to describe wine zones suggest the
relative size of the place. In descending order of
size and ascending order of specificity: country,
region, district, subdistrict, commune, vineyard.

Wines with proprietary names
You can find some pretty creative names on wine bottles these days:
Tapestry, Conundrum, Insignia, Isosceles, Mythology, Trilogy. Is this stuff to
drink, to drive, or to dab behind your ears?
Names like these are proprietary names (often trademarked) that producers
create for special wines. In the case of American wines, the bottles with 
proprietary names usually contain wines made from a blend of grapes; 
therefore, no one grape name can be used as the name of the wine.
(Remember the United States’ 75 percent policy?) In the case of European
wines, the grapes used to make the wine were probably not the approved
grapes for that region; therefore, the regional name could not be used on
the label.
Although a brand name can apply to several different wines, a proprietary
name usually applies to one specific wine. You can find Zinfandel, Cabernet
Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and numerous other wines under the Fetzer brand
from California, for example, and you can find Beaujolais, Pouilly-Fuissé,
Mâcon-Villages, and numerous other wines under the Louis Jadot brand from
France. But the proprietary name Luce applies to a single wine.
Wines with proprietary names usually are made in small quantities, are quite
expensive ($40 to $75 or more a bottle), and are high in quality.
56
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 
Grape names on European wines
Although most European wines are named after
their place of origin, grape names do sometimes
appear on labels of European wines. In Italy, for
example, the official name of a wine could be a
combination of place and grape — like the
name Barbera d’Alba, which translates as
Barbera (grape) of Alba (place).
In France, some producers have deliberately
added the grape name to their labels even though
the grape is already implicit in the wine name.
For example, a white Bourgogne (place-name)
may also have the word Chardonnay (grape) on
the label, for those wine drinkers who don’t know
that white Bourgogne is 100 percent Chardonnay.
And German wines usually carry grape names
along with their official place-names.
But even if a European wine does carry a grape
name, the most important part of the wine’s
name, in the eyes of the people who make the
wine, is the place.

Generic wines
A generic name is a wine name that has been used inappropriately for so long
that it has lost its original meaning in the eyes of the government (exactly what
Xerox, Kleenex, and Band-Aid are afraid of becoming).
Burgundy, Chianti, Chablis, Champagne, Rhine wine, Sherry, Port, and Sauterne
are all names that rightfully should apply only to wines made in those specific
places. After years of negotiation with the European Union, the U.S. govern-
ment has finally agreed that these names can no longer be used for American
wines. However, any wine that bore such a name prior to March 2006 may
continue to carry that name. In time, generic names will become less common
on wine labels.
Wine Labels, Forward and Backward
Many wine bottles have two labels. The front label names the wine and grabs
your eye as you walk down the aisle, and the back label gives you a little more
information, ranging from really helpful suggestions like “this wine tastes
delicious with food” to oh-so-useful data such as “this wine has a total acidity
of 6.02 and a pH of 3.34.”
Now, if you’re really on your toes, you may be thinking: How can you tell the
difference between front and back on a round bottle?
The government authorities in the United States apparently haven’t thought
that one through yet. They (and other governments) require certain informa-
tion to appear on the front label of all wine bottles — basic stuff, such as the
alcohol content, the type of wine (usually red table wine or white table wine),
and the country of origin — but they don’t define front label. So sometimes
producers put all that information on the smaller of two labels and call that
one the front label. Then the producers place a larger, colorful, dramatically
eye-catching label — with little more than the name of the wine on it — on
the back of the bottle. Guess which way the back label ends up facing when
the bottle is placed on the shelf?
We don’t feel at all outraged about this situation. We’d rather look at colorful
labels on the shelf than boring information-laden ones any day. And we’re not
so lazy that we can’t just pick up the bottle and turn it around to find out
what we need to know. Besides, we enjoy the idea that wine producers and
importers — whose every word and image on the label is scrutinized by the
authorities — have found one small way of getting even with the government.
57
Chapter 4: Wine Names and Label Lingo

The mandatory sentence
The federal government mandates that certain items of information appear
on labels of wines sold in the United States. Such items are generally referred
to as the mandatory. These include
 A brand name
 Indication of class or type (table wine, dessert wine, or sparkling wine)
 The percentage of alcohol by volume (unless it is implicit — for exam-
ple, the statement “table wine” implies an alcohol content of less than
14 percent; see the section “Table wine” in Chapter 1)
 Name and location of the bottler
 Net contents (expressed in milliliters; the standard wine bottle is 750 ml,
which is 25.6 ounces)
 The phrase Contains Sulfites (with very, very few exceptions)
 The government warning (that we won’t dignify by repeating here; just
pick up any bottle of wine and you’ll see it on the back label)

Wines made outside the United States but sold within it must also carry the
phrase imported by on their labels, along with the name and business loca-
tion of the importer.
Canadian regulations are similar. They require wine labels to indicate the
common name of the product (that is, wine), the net contents, the percentage
of alcohol by volume, the name and address of the producer, the wine’s coun-
try of origin, and the container size. Many of these items must be indicated in
both English and French.
The European mandate
Some of the mandatory information on American and Canadian wine labels
is also required by the EU authorities for wines produced or sold in the
European Union. But the EU regulations require additional label items for
wines produced in its member countries.
The most important of these additional items is an indication of a wine’s so-
called quality level — which really means the wine’s status in the European
Union’s hierarchy of place-names. In short, every wine made in an EU
member country must carry one of the following items on the label:
 A registered place-name, along with an official phrase that confirms that
the name is in fact a registered place-name (see the following section for
a listing of those phrases)
 A phrase indicating that the wine is a table wine, a status lower than that
of a wine with a registered place-name

Chapter 4: Wine Names and Label Lingo
Will the real producer please stand up?
Although U.S. labeling laws require wine labels
to carry the name and address of the bottler, this
information doesn’t necessarily tell you who
made the wine.
Of the various phrases that may be used to iden-
tify the bottler on labels of wine sold in the
United States, only the words produced by or
made by indicate the name of the company that
actually fermented 75 percent or more of the
wine (that is, who really made the wine); words
such as cellared by or vinted by mean only that
the company subjected the wine to cellar treat-
ment (holding it for a while, for example).

For U.S. wines, the table wine category encompasses all non-sparkling wines
that contain up to 14 percent alcohol. This is a distinctly different use of the
term table wine.
Appellations of origin
A registered place-name is called an appellation of origin. In actuality, each EU
place-name defines far more than just the name of the place that the grapes
come from: The place-name connotes the wine’s grape varieties, grape-growing
methods, and winemaking methods. Each appellation is, therefore, a definition
of the wine as well as the wine’s name.
European wines with official place-names fall into a European category called
QWPSR (Quality Wine Produced in a Specific Region). The following phrases
on European labels confirm that a wine is a QWPSR wine and that its name is
therefore a registered place-name:
 France: Appellation Contrôlée or Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée (AC or
AOC, in short), translated as regulated name or regulated place-name.
Also, on labels of wines from places of slightly lower status, the initials
AO VDQS, standing for Appellation d’Origine — Vins Délimités de Qualité
Supérieure; translated as place-name, demarcated wine of superior quality.
 Italy: Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC), translated as regulated
place-name; or for certain wines of an even higher status, Denominazione
di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG), translated as regulated and
guaranteed place-name.
 Spain: Denominación de Origen (DO), translated as place-name; and
Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOC), translated as qualified-origin
place-name for regions with the highest status (of which there are only
two, Rioja and Priorat).
 Portugal: Denominação de Origem (DO), translated as place-name.
 Germany: Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA), translated as
quality wine from a specific region; or Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP),
translated as quality wine with special attributes, for the best wines.
(Read more about Germany’s complex appellation system in Chapter 11.)
For European table wines — wines without an official appellation of origin —
each European country has two phrases. One term applies to table wines
with a geographic indication (actually Italy has two phrases in this category),
and another denotes table wines with no geographic indication smaller than
the country of production. These phrases are

The phrase for a registered place-name in the United States is American
Viticultural Area (AVA). But the phrase does not appear on wine labels (refer
to Figure 4-1). Nor does any such phrase appear on labels of Australian or
South American wines.
Some optional label lingo
Besides the mandatory information required by government authorities, all
sorts of other words can appear on wine labels. These words can be meaning-
less phrases intended to make you think that you’re getting a special quality
wine, or words that provide useful information about what’s in the bottle.
Sometimes the same word can fall into either category, depending on the
label. This ambiguity occurs because some words that are strictly regulated
in some producing countries are not at all regulated in others.

Vintage
The word vintage followed by a year, or the year listed alone without the
word vintage, is the most common optional item on a wine label (refer to
Figure 4-2). Sometimes the vintage appears on the front label, and sometimes
it has its own small label above the front label.
The vintage year is nothing more than the year in which the grapes for a par-
ticular wine grew; the wine must have 75 to 100 percent of the grapes of this
year, depending on the country of origin. (Nonvintage wines are blends of
wines whose grapes were harvested in different years.) But there is an aura
surrounding vintage-dated wine that causes many people to believe that any
wine with a vintage date is by definition better than a wine without a vintage
date. In fact, there is no correlation between the presence of a vintage date and
the wine’s quality.
63
Chapter 4: Wine Names and Label Lingo
The EU hierarchy of wine
Although each country within the European
Union makes its own laws regarding the naming
of wine, these laws must fit within the frame-
work of the European Union law. This frame-
work provides two levels into which every
single EU-produced wine must fit:
 Quality wine: Wines with official appella-
tions of origin. (Each appellation regulation
defines the geographic area, the grapes
that may be used, grape-growing practices,
winemaking and aging techniques, and so
on.) This category is abbreviated as QWPSR
in English (Quality Wine Produced in a
Specific Region) or VQPRD in several other
European languages. All AOC, DOC, DO, and
QbA wines — to use the abbreviations
mentioned previously in this chapter — fall
into this category.
 Table wine: All other wines produced within
the European Union. The table wine cate-
gory has two subcategories: Table wines
that carry a precise geographic indication
on their labels, such as French vin de pays
or Spanish vino de la tierra wines; and table
wines with no geographic indication except
the country of origin. These latter wines
may not carry a vintage or a grape name.
All other wines sold in the European Union fall
into a third category:
 Wine: Wines produced by countries outside
the European Union, such as the United
States, Canada, or Australia. If a wine has a
geographic indication smaller than the
country of origin, it enjoys higher status
than otherwise.

Generally speaking, what vintage a wine is — that is, whether the grapes grew
in a year with perfect weather or whether the grapes were meteorologically
challenged — is an issue you need to consider a) only when you buy top
quality wines, and b) mainly when those wines come from parts of the world
that experience significant variations in weather from year to year — such as
many European wine regions.
Reserve
Reserve is our favorite meaningless word on American wine labels. The term
is used to convince you that the wine inside the bottle is special. This trick
usually works because the word does have specific meaning and does carry a
certain amount of prestige on labels of wines from many other countries:
 In Italy and Spain, the word reserve (or its foreign language equivalent,
which looks something like reserve) indicates a wine that has received
extra aging at the winery before release. Implicit in the extra aging is the
idea that the wine was better than normal and, therefore, worthy of the
extra aging. Spain even has degrees of reserve, such as Gran Reserva.
 In France, the use of reserve is not regulated. However, its use is generally
consistent with the notion that the wine is better in quality than a given
producer’s norm.
In the United States, the word reserve has historically been used in the same
sense — as in Beaulieu Vineyards Georges de Latour Private Reserve, the
best Cabernet that Beaulieu Vineyards makes. But these days, the word is
bandied about so much that it no longer has meaning. For example, some
California wines labeled Proprietor’s Reserve sell for $6 a bottle. Those wines
are not only the least expensive wines in a particular producer’s lineup,
but also some of the least expensive wines, period. Other wines are labeled
Special Reserve, Vintage Reserve, Vintner’s Reserve, or Reserve Selection —
all utterly meaningless phrases.
Estate-bottled
Estate is a genteel word for a wine farm, a combined grape-growing and wine-
making operation. The words estate-bottled on a wine label indicate that the
company that bottled the wine also grew the grapes and made the wine. In
other words, estate-bottled suggests accountability from the vineyard to the
winemaking through to the bottling. In many countries, the winery does not
necessarily have to own the vineyards, but it has to control the vineyards
and perform the vineyard operations.
Estate-bottling is an important concept to those who believe that you can’t
make good wine unless the grapes are as good as they can possibly be. If we
made wine, we’d sure want to control our own vineyards.
64
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

We wouldn’t go so far as to say that great wines must be estate-bottled, though.
Ravenswood Winery — to name just one example — makes some terrific
wines from the grapes of small vineyards owned and operated by private
landowners. And some large California landowners, such as the Sangiacomo
family, are quite serious about their vineyards but do not make wine them-
selves; they sell their grapes to various wineries. None of those wines would
be considered estate-bottled.
Sometimes French wine labels carry the words domaine-bottled or château-
bottled (or the phrase mis en bouteille au château/au domaine). The concept
is the same as estate-bottled, with domaine and château being equivalent to
the American term estate.
Vineyard name
Some wines in the medium-to-expensive price category — costing about $25
or more — may carry on the label the name of the specific vineyard where
the grapes for that wine grew. Sometimes one winery will make two or three
different wines that are distinguishable only by the vineyard name on the
label. Each wine is unique because the terroir of each vineyard is unique.
These single vineyards may or may not be identified by the word vineyard
next to the name of the vineyard.
Italian wines, which are really into the single-vineyard game, will have vigneto
or vigna on their labels next to the name of the single vineyard. Or they won’t.
It’s optional.
Other optional words on the label
You’ll be pleased to know that we have just about exhausted our list of terms
that you may find on a wine label.
One additional expression on some French labels is Vieilles Vignes (vee yay
veen), which translates as old vines, and appears as such on some Californian
and Australian labels. Because old vines produce a very small quantity of fruit
compared to younger vines, the quality of their grapes and of the resulting
wine is considered to be very good. The problem is, the phrase is unregulated.
Anyone can claim that his vines are old.
The word superior can appear in French (Supérieure) or Italian (Superiore)
as part of an AOC or DOC place-name (refer to the section “The mandatory
sentence,” earlier in this chapter, for a refresher on these acronyms). It means
the wine attained a higher alcohol level than a nonsuperior version of the
same wine would have. Frankly, it’s a distinction not worth losing sleep over.
The word Classico appears on the labels of some Italian DOC and DOCG wines
when the grapes come from the heartland of the named place.

 Separating the meaningful wine terms from the mumbo jumbo
 ML, pH, microx and stirred lees
 Technical terms to wow your friends
T
he most frustrating thing about wine has to be the technical lingo. All you
want is a crisp, fruity white wine to serve with tonight’s fried chicken. But to
find it, you have to fight your way through a jungle of jargon. You encounter it
on the back labels of wine bottles, in the words the sales clerk uses to explain
his recommendations, and on the signs all around the wine shop. Why on
earth is everyone making wine so complicated?
Here’s the story: Wine is two products. Some wine is just a beverage, and it
should taste good — period. Other wine is an art form that fascinates and
intrigues people. Many people who make and sell wine want you to think that
their wines are in the second category, because such wines are more presti-
gious. Complicated technical language is supposed to make you think that a
wine is special, more than just a beverage.
How much of this information (if any) is pivotal in helping you get the kind of
wine you want, and how much is pretentious technobabble? Read on.
Grapegrowing, Winemaking, and 
the Jargon that Surrounds Them
Winemakers use numerous techniques to make wine. These techniques vary
according to the grapes the winemakers have and the type of wine they’re
making. (If a winemaker is producing a huge quantity of a wine that will sell
for $5.99, for example, he probably won’t put the wine into new oak barrels
because the cost of the barrels can add as much as $5 to the price of every
bottle.)

No winemaking procedure is inherently good or inherently bad. Any technique
can be right or wrong depending on the grapes and the type of wine being
made — that is, the price level, the taste profile the winemaker is seeking,
and the type of wine drinker the winery is targeting. Different wines appeal
to different wine drinkers at different times:
 Some wines are intended to taste good right away, while others are
intended to taste good down the road, after the wine has aged (see
Chapter 16).
 Some are intended to taste good to casual wine drinkers, while others
are intended for more experienced wine lovers.
How the wine tastes is the ultimate validation of any method used to produce
a wine: The procedures themselves are meaningless if they don’t create a
wine that is appealing to the wine drinkers for whom that wine is intended.
The taste of the wine involves not just its flavors, but its aroma, body, texture,
length, and so on (see Chapter 2). And the taste of a wine is a subjective
experience.
Every winemaking technique does affect the taste of the wine in one way or
another, however. Most of the technical words that are bandied about in wine
circles represent procedures that are relevant to the taste of a wine. But —
here’s the key point — these technical words each represent isolated elements
in the making of the wine, which are only parts of the total picture that begins
with the grapes and ends when you put the wine in your mouth.
Viti-vini
Producing wine actually involves two separate steps: the growing of the
grapes, called viticulture, and the making of the wine, called vinification.
(In some wine courses, students nickname the dual process viti-vini.)
Sometimes one company performs both steps, as is the case with estate-bottled
wines (see Chapter 4). And sometimes the two steps are completely separate.
For example, some large wineries buy grapes from private grape growers.
These growers don’t make wine; they just grow grapes and sell them to what-
ever wine company offers them the highest price per ton.
In the case of the very least expensive wines, the winery named on the label
may have purchased not even grapes but wine (from bulk wine producers),
and then blended the wines and bottled the final product as his own. (As we
mention in Chapter 4, only the terms produced by or made by on the label
assure you that the company named on the label actually vinified most of
that wine.)
68
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

Vine-growing variations
Growing grapes for wine is a fairly intricate process that viticulturalists are
constantly refining to suit their particular soil, climate, and grape varieties.
Many of the technical terms spill over into discussions about wine, or crop
up on wine labels.
Here are the expressions that you’re likely to encounter as you dig further
into wine:
 Microclimate: Every wine region has climatic conditions (the amount and
timing of sun, rain, wind, humidity, and so on) that are considered the
norm for that area. But individual locations within a region — the south-
facing side of a particular hill, for example — can have a climatic reality
that is different from neighboring vineyards. The unique climatic reality
of a specific location is usually called its microclimate. Technically, the
correct term for what we have just described is mesoclimate, but micro-
climate is a more common term on back labels and in colloquial usage.
 Canopy: Left untended, grapevines would grow along the ground, up
trees, wherever. (They’re vines, after all!) Commercial viticulture involves
attaching the shoots of vines to wires or trellises in a systematic pattern.
The purpose of training the vine — as this activity is called — is to 
position the grape bunches so that they get enough sun to ripen well
and so that the fruit is easy for the harvesters to reach.
An open canopy is a trellising method that maximizes the sunlight exposure
of the grapes. Canopy management, the practice of maneuvering the leaves
and fruit into the best position for a given vineyard, is a popular buzzword.
 Ripeness: Harvesting grapes when they’re perfectly ripe is one of the
crucial points in wine production. (See Chapter 3.) But ripeness is a 
subjective issue.
In cooler climates, a high degree of ripeness doesn’t happen every year;
wines from “riper” vintages should therefore be richer and fuller-bodied
than the norm for that type of wine. In warmer climates, ripeness is
almost automatic; the trick becomes not letting the grapes get too ripe
too fast, which causes them to be high in sugar but still physiologically
immature and undeveloped in their flavors (like a physically precocious
but immature teenager). There’s no fixed definition of perfect ripeness.
 Low yields: Generally speaking, the more grapes a grapevine grows
(the higher its yield of grapes), the less concentrated the flavors of those
grapes will be, and the lower in quality (and less expensive) their wine
will be. Just about any wine producer anywhere can claim that his yields
are low, because it’s too complicated to prove otherwise. The proof is
usually in the wine’s concentration of flavor: If the wine tastes thin or
watery, we’d be suspicious of the “low yield” claim.
69
Chapter 5: Behind the Scenes of Winemaking

 Organic: Grapegrowers increasingly farm their vineyards organically,
that is without using chemical pesticides, herbicides and so forth.
Their reasons have to do with the health of the land, and often their
belief that organically grown grapes are superior to conventionally
farmed grapes, and that they make better wine. For a wine label in
the Unites States to state that the grapes for that wine were grown
organically, the vineyard must be certified as organic by a government-
approved organization.
A related term is biodynamic; this means that the vineyards are not only
organic but also are farmed in keeping with the principles established in
the early 20th century by Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner, which
involve cosmic aspects such as respecting the movement of the moon
and the planets in the timing of the work on the land. Biodynamic wines
enjoy almost a cult following.
Winemaking wonders
The vinification end of wine production falls into two parts:
 Fermentation, the period when the grape juice turns into wine
 Maturation (or finishing), the period following fermentation when the
wine settles down, loses its rough edges, goes to prep school, and gets
ready to meet the world
Depending on the type of wine being made, the whole process can take three
months or five years — or even longer if the bank isn’t breathing down the
winery’s neck.
Winemakers don’t have as many options in making wine as chefs do in prepar-
ing food — but almost! Of all the jargon you’re likely to hear, information about
oak is probably the most common.
When wood becomes magic
Oak barrels, 60 gallons in size, are often used as containers for wine during
either fermentation or maturation. The barrels lend oaky flavor and aroma to
the wine, which many people find very appealing; they can also affect the 
texture of the wine and its color. The barrels are expensive — about $800 per
barrel if they’re made from French oak. (Most people consider French oak to
be the finest.) We suppose the expense is one good reason to boast about
using the barrels.
70
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

But not all oak is the same. Oak barrels vary in the origin of their oak, the
amount of toast (a charring of the inside of the barrels) each barrel has, how
often the barrels have been used (their oaky character diminishes with use),
and even the size of the barrels. Even if all oak were the same, a wine can turn
out differently depending on whether unfermented juice or actual wine went
into the barrels, and how long it stayed there.
In fact, the whole issue of oak is so complex that anyone who suggests 
that a wine is better simply because it has been oaked is guilty of gross 
oversimplification.
Barrel-fermented versus barrel-aged
You don’t have to venture very far into wine before you find someone explain-
ing to you that a particular wine was barrel-fermented or barrel-aged. What in
the world does he mean, and should you care?
The term barrel-fermented means that unfermented juice went into barrels
(almost always oak) and changed into wine there. The term barrel-aged usually
means that wine (already fermented) went into barrels and stayed there for a
maturation period — from a few months to a couple of years. Because most
wines that ferment in barrels remain there for several months after fermenta-
tion ends, barrel-fermented and barrel-aged are often used together. Theterm
barrel-aged alone suggests that the fermentation happened somewhere other
than the barrel — usually in stainless steel tanks.
Classic barrel-fermentation — juice into the barrel, wine out — applies mainly
to white wines, and the reason is very practical. As we mention in Chapter 2,
the juice of red grapes ferments together with the grape skins in order to
become red, and those solids are mighty messy to clean out of a small barrel!
Red wines usually ferment in larger containers — stainless steel tanks or
large wooden vats — and then age in small oak barrels after the wine has
been drained off the grape skins. (Some light, fruity styles of red wine may not
be oaked at all.) Some winemakers do partially ferment their reds in barrels;
they start the fermentation in tanks, then drain the juice from the skins and
let that juice finish its fermentation in barrels, without the skins. When a red
wine is described as being barrel-fermented, that’s usually the process.
Here’s why you might care whether a white wine is barrel-fermented or just
barrel-aged. Wines that ferment in barrels actually end up tasting less oaky
than wines that simply age in barrels, even though they may have spent more
time in oak. (A barrel-fermented and barrel-aged Chardonnay may have spent
11 months in oak, for example, and a barrel-aged Chardonnay may have spent
only 5 months in oak.) That’s because juice interacts differently with the oak
than wine does.
71
Chapter 5: Behind the Scenes of Winemaking

A lot of people who are supposed to know more about wine than you confuse
the effects of the two processes and tell you that the barrel-fermented wine
tastes oakier. If you have a strong opinion about the flavor of oak in your wine,
be sure that you know the real story.
Even More Winemaking Terms
Become a wine expert overnight and dazzle your friends with this amazing
array of wine jargon. (Just don’t fool yourself into believing that any one of
the procedures described necessarily creates a high-quality wine. The merit
of each procedure depends on the particular wine being made.)
 Temperature control: The modern age of winemaking began when 
winemakers were able to scientifically control the temperature of their
fermentations by using stainless steel tanks rigged with cooling jackets
or other computer-operated cooling devices. Because the temperature
of the fermentation (about 54° to 77° F or 12° to 25° C for white wines
and 77° to 93° F, or 25° to 34° C for reds) affects the final style of the
wine, temperature control is critical. But, hey, this process was revolu-
tionary and exciting almost half a century ago. Today it’s just ho-hum
par for the course.
 Stainless steel: Large tanks made of shiny, hygienic stainless steel are
the vessels of choice for most fermentations, whether for red wine or
white. When you hear a winemaker or wine expert say that a particular
wine fermented in stainless steel, understand him to mean that one of
three things is true:
• The wine was not oaked at all (which is common for many aromatic-
style white wines such as Rieslings, for example, to preserve the
grapes’ own flavors).
• The wine was barrel-aged rather than barrel-fermented (see the
previous section).
• The winery sunk a lot of money into its equipment and wants you
to know it.
 Lees: Lees is the name for various solids such as dead yeast cells that
precipitate to the bottom of a wine after fermentation. These solids can
interact with the wine and create more complex flavors in the wine.
(Sometimes the winemaker stirs the lees around in the wine periodically
to prevent off-flavors.) A white wine with extended lees contact is usually
richer in texture and tastes less overtly fruity than it would otherwise.
 ML or malolactic: Malolactic, nicknamed ML or malo, is a secondary fer-
mentation that weakens the acids in the wine, making the wine softer
and less acidic. ML usually happens naturally, but a winemaker can also
incite it or prevent it.
72
Part I: Getting to Know Wine 

Red wines almost always undergo malolactic fermentation, but for white
wines, ML is a stylistic judgment call on the winemaker’s part. Sometimes,
ML can contribute a buttery flavor to a white wine, but it diminishes the
wine’s fresh-fruitiness.
 pH: The chemical term pH means exactly the same thing for wine as it
does in other scientific fields. (“Our facial cream is pH-balanced for sen-
sitive skin.”) If you want a technical explanation, look up your former
chemistry teacher. If you’ll settle for the general concept, pH is a mea-
surement of acidity; wines with low pH (approximately 3.4 or less) have
stronger acidity, and wines with high pH have weaker acidity.
 Soft tannins: Tannin in red wines varies not only in its quantity, but also
in its nature. Some tannins give wines rich texture and an impression of
substance without tasting bitter; other tannins are astringent and mouth-
drying. Soft tannins, or ripe tannins, are buzzphrases for the good kind.
Winemakers achieve soft tannins by harvesting fully ripe grapes, con-
trolling fermentation time and temperature, and using other techniques.
 Microxygenation: This relatively new, high-tech winemaking technique
involves feeding miniscule, controlled amounts of oxygen into a wine
during or after fermentation. One effect is that it can mimic the gentle,
steady exposure to oxygen that barrel-aged red wines receive as they
mature in wood, and can thus help red wines develop softer tannins and
more stable color without any actual use of oak. You hear this term,
sometimes abbreviated as microx, thrown around in technical circles.
 Fining and filtering: Winemakers fine and filter most wines near the end of
their maturation period. The purpose of these procedures is to clarify the
wine — that is, to remove any cloudiness or solid matter in the wine —
and to stabilize it — to remove any yeast, bacteria, or other microscopic
critters that may change the wine for the worse after it is bottled.
There’s a popular belief among anti-tech wine lovers that fining and fil-
tration strip a wine of its character — and that unfined, unfiltered wines
are inherently better, even if they’re not brilliant in appearance. But it’s a
complex issue. (For one thing, there are degrees of fining and filtration,
like light fining and gentle filtration.) These processes, when carried out
carefully, are not detrimental to wine.
 Blending: This term usually applies to the process of making a wine
from more than one grape variety. Winemakers generally ferment the 
different grapes separately and then blend their wines together.
The reasons for blending wines of different grapes are either to reduce
costs — by diluting an expensive wine like Chardonnay with something
else far less expensive, for example — or to improve the quality of the
wine by using complementary grapes whose characteristics enhance
each other. Many of Europe’s traditional wines — such as red Rioja, red
Bordeaux, Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and Champagne — are blended wines
that owe their personalities to several grapes.

Wine terms that mean nothing
Sometimes winemakers or salespeople use
words to describe their wines that, frankly, have
no real meaning. When you hear these terms,

 Selecting a good wine merchant
 Finding the help you need to get the wine you want
U
nless you enjoy a permanent, dependent relationship with an indulgent
wine expert, the day will come when you have to purchase a bottle of
wine yourself. If you’re lucky, the shop owner will just happen to be some
enlightened fellow or gal whose life’s purpose is to make wine easy and acces-
sible to others. The odds are, however, that most of the time you’ll feel as if
you’re dancing in the dark.
Buying Wine Can Intimidate Anyone
Common sense suggests that buying a few bottles of wine should be less
stressful than, say, applying for a bank loan or interviewing for a new job.
What’s the big deal? It’s only grape juice.
But memories tell us otherwise. There was the time that one particular wine
shop wouldn’t take back one of the two bottles of inexpensive wine that we
bought the week before, even when we explained how awful the first bottle
had been. (Were we wrong about the wine or were they arrogant? We wasted
days wondering.) And the time we pretended we knew what we were doing
and bought a full case — 12 bottles — of a French wine based on the brand’s
general reputation, not realizing that the particular vintage we purchased was
a miserable aberration from the brand’s usual quality. (Why didn’t we just ask
someone in the store? We might have received good advice.) Then there were
the many times we spent staring at shelves lined with bottles whose labels
might as well have been written in Greek, for all that we could understand
from them. Fortunately, our enthusiasm for wine caused us to persevere.
We eventually discovered that wine shopping can be fun.

Our experience has taught us that the single most effective way to assure
yourself of more good wine-buying experiences than bad ones is to come to
terms with your knowledge — or lack thereof — of the subject.
Too much information about wine is constantly changing — new vintages
each year, hundreds of new wineries, new brands, and so on — for anyone to
presume that he knows it all, or for anyone to feel insecure about what he
doesn’t know.
If we’d all quit pretending that we know more than we do and give up our
defensiveness about what we don’t know, buying wine would become the
simple exchange that it should be.
Wine Retailers, Large and Small
Buying wine in a store to drink later at home is great for a number of reasons,
not the least of which is that stores usually have a much bigger selection
of wines than restaurants do, and they charge you less for them. You can
examine the bottles carefully and compare the labels. And you can drink
the wine at home from the glass — and at the temperature — of your 
choosing.
On the other hand, you have to provide your own wine glasses, and you
have to open the bottle yourself (see Chapter 8 for the lowdown on all that).
And that big selection of wines in the store can be downright daunting.
Depending on where you live, you can buy wine at all sorts of stores: super-
markets, wine superstores, discount warehouses, or small specialty wine
shops. Each type of store has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms
of selection, price, or service.
Wine is a regulated beverage in many countries, and governments often get
involved in deciding where and how wine may be sold. Some states within
the United States and some provinces in Canada have raised government
control of alcoholic beverage sales to a fine art, deciding not only where you
can buy wine, but which wines are available for you to buy. If you love wine
and live in one of those areas (you know who you are), take comfort in the
fact that a) you have a vote; b) freedom of choice lies just across the border;
and c) if the Iron Curtain can topple, there’s hope for change in your local
government, too.
78
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

We’ll assume a healthy, open-minded, free-market economy for wine in our
discussion of retail wine sales. We hope that scenario applies where you live,
because your enjoyment of wine will blossom all the more easily if it does.
Supermarkets, superstores, and so on
In truly open wine markets, you can buy wine in supermarkets, like any other
food product. Supermarkets and their large-scale brethren, discount ware-
houses, make wine accessible to everyone.
When wine is sold in supermarkets or discount stores, the mystique sur-
rounding the product evaporates: Who can waste time feeling insecure about
a wine purchase when there are much more critical issues at hand, such as
how much time is left before the kids turn into monsters and which is the
shortest line at the checkout? And the prices, especially in large stores, are
usually quite reasonable.
The downside of buying wine in these stores is that your selection is often
limited to wines produced by large wineries that generate enough volume to
sell to supermarket chains. And you’ll seldom get any advice on which wines
to buy. Basically, you’re on your own.
We know for a fact that some people in the wine business disapprove of the
straightforward attitude toward wine in supermarkets and discount stores;
they think wine is sacrosanct and should always be treated like an elite bev-
erage. At least you won’t run into them as you browse the wine aisles in your
supermarket.
Discount stores are good places to find private label wines — wines that are
created especially for the chain, and that carry a brand name that’s owned by
the store. These wines usually are decent (but not great), and if you like the
wines, they can be excellent values. Some of the “club” chains may also offer —
in smaller quantities — higher-end wines than supermarkets do.
To guide you on your wine-buying journey, many stores offer plenty of 
shelf-talkers (small signs on the shelves that describe individual wines).
These shelf-talkers should be taken with a very large grain of salt. They are
often provided by the company selling the wine, which is more interested in
convincing you to grab a bottle than in offering information to help you under-
stand the wine. Most likely, you’ll find flowery phrases, hyperbolic adjectives,
impressive scores and safe, common-denominator stuff like “delicious with
fish.” (Any fish, cooked in any way?) The information will be biased and of
limited value. We strongly recommend that you find a knowledgeable person
from the store to help you, if at all possible, rather than rely on shelf-talkers.
79
Chapter 6: Navigating a Wine Shop

The bottom line is that supermarkets and discount warehouses can be great
places to buy everyday wine for casual enjoyment. But if what you really want
is to learn about wine as you buy it, or if you want an unusually interesting
variety of wines to satisfy your rapacious curiosity, you will probably find
yourself shopping elsewhere.
Wine specialty shops
Wine specialty shops are small- to medium-sized stores that sell wine and
liquor and, sometimes, wine books, corkscrews (see Chapter 8 for more on
those), wine glasses, and maybe a few specialty foods. The foods sold in wine
shops tend to be gourmet items rather than just run-of-the-mill snack foods.
If you decide to pursue wine as a serious hobby, shops like these are the
places where you’ll probably end up buying your wine because they offer
many advantages that larger operations cannot. For one thing, wine specialty
shops almost always have wine-knowledgeable staffers on the premises.
Also, you can usually find an interesting, varied selection of wines at all
price levels.
Wine shops often organize their wines by country of origin and — in the case
of classic wine countries, such as France, by region (Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Rhône, and so on). Red wines and white wines are often in separate sections
within these country areas. There may be a special section for Champagnes
and other sparkling wines and another section for dessert wines. Some stores
are now organizing their wine sections by style, such as “Aromatic Whites,”
“Powerful Reds,” and so forth. A few organize the wines according to grape
varieties.
80
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
Supermarket survival tips
If you’re shopping in a supermarket where
there’s no one to turn to for advice, do one of the
following:
 Consult a list of recommended wines from
the last wine article that impressed you.
 Call a wine-knowledgeable friend on your
cell phone (assuming that his or her palate
and yours get along).
 Buy the wine with the prettiest label. What
have you got to lose?

Some wine shops have a special area (or even a super-special, temperature-
controlled room) for the finer or more expensive wines. In some stores, it’s a
locked vault-like room. In others, it’s the whole back area of the store.
Over in a corner somewhere, often right by the door to accommodate quick
purchases, there’s usually a cold box, a refrigerated cabinet with glass doors
where bottles of best-selling white and sparkling wines sit. Unless you really
must have an ice-cold bottle of wine immediately (the two of you have just
decided to elope, the marriage minister is a mile down the road, and the wed-
ding toast is only ten minutes away), avoid the cold box. The wines in there
are usually too cold and, therefore, may not be in good condition. You never
know how long the bottle you select has been sitting there under frigid condi-
tions, numbed lifeless.
Near the front of the store you may also see boxes or bins of special sale
wines. Sometimes, sale wines are those the merchant is trying to unload
because he has had them for too long, or they’re wines that he got a special
deal on (because the distributor is trying to unload them). When in doubt,
try one bottle first before committing to a larger quantity.
Sale displays are usually topped with case cards — large cardboard signs
that stand above the open boxes of wine — or similar descriptive material.
Our words of caution in the previous section on the credibility of shelf-talkers
apply to case cards, too; but because case cards are a lot bigger, there’s more
of a chance that some useful information may appear on them.
81
Chapter 6: Navigating a Wine Shop
Ten clues for identifying a store 
where you should not buy wine
1. The dust on the wine bottles is more than
1/8-inch thick.
2. Many of the white wines are dark gold or
light-brown in color.
3. The most recent vintage in the store is 1997.
4. The colors on all the wine labels have faded
from bright sunlight.
5. It’s warmer than a sauna inside.
6. Most of the bottles are standing up.
7. All the bottles are standing up!
8. The selection consists mainly of jug wines
or cheap “Bag-in-the-Box” wines.
9. The June Wine of the Month is a three-
year-old Beaujolais Nouveau.
10. The owner resembles the stern teacher
who always hated you.

Choosing the Right Wine Merchant
Sizing up a wine merchant is as simple as sizing up any other specialty
retailer. The main criteria are fair prices, a wide selection, staff expertise,
and service. Also, the shop must store its wines in the proper conditions.
No such species in your neighborhood? In Chapter 16, we talk about the
advantages and disadvantages of buying wine by catalog, telephone, mail,
or the Internet, which can be good alternatives if you don’t have access to a
decent wine shop where you live.
Putting price in perspective
When you’re a novice wine buyer, your best strategy is to shop around with
an eye to service and reliable advice more than to price. After you’ve found a
merchant who has suggested several wines that you’ve liked, stick with him,
even if he doesn’t have the best prices in town. It makes better sense to pay a
dollar or so more for wines recommended by a reliable merchant (wines that
you’ll probably like) than to buy wines in a cut-rate or discount store and save
a buck, especially if that store has no special wine adviser or if the advice you
receive is suspect.
When you have more knowledge of wine, you’ll have enough confidence to
shop at stores with the best prices. But even then, price must take a backseat
to the storage conditions of the wine (see “Judging wine storage conditions,”
later in this chapter).
Evaluating selection and expertise
You won’t necessarily know on your first visit whether a particular store’s
selection is adequate for you. If you notice many wines from many different
countries at various prices, give the store’s selection the benefit of the doubt.
If you outgrow the selection as you learn more about wine, you can seek out a
new merchant at that point.
Don’t be too ready to give a merchant the benefit of the doubt when it comes
to expertise, however. Some retailers are not only extremely knowledgeable
about the specific wines they sell, but also extremely knowledgeable about
wine in general. But some retailers know less than their customers. Just as
you expect a butcher to know his cuts of meat, you should expect a wine
merchant to know wine. Be free with your questions (such as, “Can you tell
me something about this wine?” or “How are these two wines different?”),
and judge how willing and able the merchant is to answer them.
82
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

Expect a wine merchant to have personal knowledge and experience of the
wines he sells. These days, a lot of retailers use the ratings of a few critics as
a crutch in selling wines. They plaster their shelves with the critics’ scores
(usually a number like 90 on a scale of 100) and advertise their wines by
these numbers (see Chapter 18). We agree that selling by the numbers is
one quick way of communicating an approximate sense of the wine’s quality.
(Remember, that doesn’t mean you’ll like the wine!) But the retailer’s knowl-
edge and experience of the wines simply must go beyond the critics’ scores,
or he’s not doing his job properly.
Expecting service with a smile
Most knowledgeable wine merchants pride themselves in their ability to
guide you through the maze of wine selections and help you find a wine
that you will like. Trust a merchant’s advice at least once or twice and see
whether his choices are good ones for you. If he’s not flexible enough — or
knowledgeable enough — to suggest wine that suits your needs, obviously
you need another merchant. All it will have cost you is the price of a bottle or
two of wine. (Much less costly than choosing the wrong doctor or lawyer!)
Speaking of service, any reputable wine merchant will accept a bottle back
from you if he has made a poor recommendation or if the wine seems dam-
aged. After all, he wants to keep you as a customer. But with the privilege
comes responsibility: Be reasonable. It’s always a good idea to ask ahead of
time about the store’s defective and unopened wine policy. You should return
an open bottle only if you think the wine is defective — in which case the bottle
should be mostly full! Hold on to the store’s receipt, and don’t wait several
months before returning an unopened bottle of wine. By that time, the store
may have a hard time reselling the wine. After a week or two, consider the
wine yours whether you like it or not.
Judging wine storage conditions
Here’s a fact about wine that’s worth learning early on: Wine is a perishable
product. It doesn’t go moldy like cheese, and it can’t host e-coli bacteria, as
meat can. It normally poses no health hazard beyond those associated with
alcohol and certain individuals’ sensitivities, even when it’s past its prime.
In fact, some wines — usually the more expensive ones — can get better and
better as they get older. But if wine is not stored properly, its taste can suffer.
(For advice on storing wine in your own home, see in Chapter 16.)
83
Chapter 6: Navigating a Wine Shop

In sizing up a wine shop, especially if you plan to buy a lot of wine or expensive
wine, check out the store’s wine storage conditions. What you don’t want to
see is an area that’s warm — for example, wines stored near the boiler so that
they cook all winter, or wines stored on the top floor of the building where
the sun can smile on them all summer.
The very best shops will have climate-controlled storerooms for wine —
although, frankly, these shops are in the minority. If a shop does have a good
storage facility, the proprietor will be happy to show it off to you because
he’ll be rightfully proud of all the expense and effort he put into it.
In better wine shops, you’ll see most of the bottles (except for the inexpen-
sive, large, jug-like bottles) lying in a horizontal position, so that their corks
remain moist, ensuring a firm closure. A dry cork can crack or shrink and let
air into the bottle, which will spoil the wine. A short time upright does not
affect wine much, and so stores with a high turnover can get away with stor-
ing their fast-selling wines that way, but slower selling, expensive bottles,
especially those intended for long maturation in your cellar will fare better in
the long run lying down.
Unfortunately, the problem of wine spoilage doesn’t begin at the retail outlet.
Quite frequently, the wholesaler or distributor — the company from which the
retailer purchases wine — doesn’t have proper storage conditions, either.
And there have certainly been instances when wine has been damaged by
extremes of weather even before it got to the distributor — for example,
while sitting on the docks in the dead of winter (or the dead of summer) or
while traveling through the Panama Canal. A good retailer will check out the
quality of the wine before he buys it, or he will send it back if he discovers
the problem after he has already bought the wine.
Strategies for Wine Shopping
When you get beyond all the ego-compromising innuendo associated with
buying wine, you can really have fun in wine shops. We remember when we
first caught the wine bug. We spent countless hours on Saturdays visiting dif-
ferent wine stores near our home. (To a passionate wine lover, 50 miles can
be near.) Trips to other cities offered new opportunities to explore. So many
wines, so little time. . . .
We discovered good, reliable stores — and stores that we would Recommend
Only To Our Worst Enemies (ROTOWE). Naturally, we made our share of mis-
takes along the way, but we learned a lot of good lessons.
84
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

See a chance, take it
When we first started buying wine, our repertoire was about as broad as a
two-year-old child’s vocabulary. We’d buy the same brands again and again
because we knew what to expect from them, and we liked them well enough —
both good reasons to buy a particular wine. But in retrospect, we let ourselves
get stuck in a rut because we were afraid to take a chance on anything new.
If wine was really going to be fun, we realized, we had to be a little more
adventuresome.
If you want to experience the wonderful array of wines in the world, experi-
menting is a must. New wines can be interesting and exciting. Now and then
you might get a lemon, but at least you’ll learn not to buy that wine again!
Explain what you want
The following scene — or something very much like it — occurs in every
wine shop every day (and ten times every Saturday):
Customer: I remember that the wine had a yellow label. I had it in this little
restaurant last week.
Wine Merchant: Do you know what country it’s from?
85
Chapter 6: Navigating a Wine Shop
How to avoid encounters with poorly stored wine
If you don’t know how a wine has been stored —
and let’s face it, most of the time you don’t — you
can do two things to minimize the risk of getting
a bad bottle.
First, patronize retailers who seem to care about
their wine and who provide their customers with
good service. Second, be attentive to seasonal
weather patterns when buying wine or when
having it shipped to you. We’re very cautious
about buying wine at the end of, or during, a very
hot summer, unless the store has a good climate-
control system. And we never have wine shipped
to us (other than quick deliveries from our local
shop) at the height of summer or winter.
Another way of knowing that the wine you are
buying is sound is just to buy the best-selling,
most popular wines — assuming you don’t mind
being a slave to taste trends. Wines that move
through the distribution chain very quickly have
less opportunity to be damaged along the way.

Customer: I think it’s Italian, but I’m not sure. 
Wine Merchant: Do you recall the grape variety?
Customer: No, but I think it has a deer or a moose on the label. Maybe if I
walk around, I can spot it.
Needless to say, most of the time that customer never finds the wine he or
she is looking for.
When you come across a wine you like in a restaurant or at a friend’s house,
write down as much specific information about the wine from the label as
you can. Don’t trust your memory. If your wine merchant can see the name,
he can give you that wine or — if he doesn’t have that exact wine — he may
be able to give you something very similar to it.
It’s clearly to your advantage to be able to tell your wine retailer anything
you can about the types of wine that you have liked previously or that you
want to try. Describe what you like in clear, simple terms. For example, for
white wine, you might use such words as “crisp, dry,” or “fruity, ripe, oaky,
buttery, full-bodied.” For red wines, you might say “big, rich, tannic,” or
“medium-bodied, soft.” Turn to Chapter 2 to learn other helpful descriptors.
For detailed guidance in describing the taste of wines, read our book Wine
Style (Wiley).
86
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
In-store samplings
In general, we’re all for tasting wines before
buying them, whenever possible. But the wine
tastings that some retailers arrange in their
stores do have their limitations. In addition to
the fact that you usually get a miniscule serving
in a little plastic cup more suited to dispensing
pills in a hospital, you get to taste only the wines
that the wine merchant (or one of his suppliers)
happens to be pushing that day. Sometimes it’s
a wine that the store made an especially good
buy on (translation: The store is making a good
profit), or a wine that a local distributor is par-
ticularly interested in selling.
Whether you like the wine or not, you may feel
some pressure to buy it after trying it. Our
advice to you is not to succumb to any con-
scious or unconscious sales pressure. Buy the
wine only if you really like it — and even then,
buy only one bottle to start. The wine may taste
completely different to you when you’re having
dinner that night. If it tastes even better than you
thought, you can always buy more bottles later.

Tell your wine merchant what kind of food you plan to have with the wine.
This will narrow down your choices even more. The wine you drink with your
flounder is probably not the one you want with spicy chili! A good wine mer-
chant is invaluable in helping you match your wine with food. Chapter 19
tells you more about the subject.
Name your price
Because the price of a bottle of wine can range from about $4 to literally hun-
dreds of dollars, it’s a good idea to decide approximately how much you want
to spend and to tell your wine merchant. Fix two price ranges in your mind:
one for everyday purposes, and one for special occasions. These prices will
probably change over time; the $6 to $10 range you start with for everyday
wines often rises to $12 to $20 as you discover better wines. A good retailer
with an adequate selection should be able to make several wine suggestions
in your preferred price category.
A good wine merchant is more interested in the repeat business he’ll get by
making you happy than he is in trading you up to a bottle of wine that’s
beyond your limits. If what you want to spend is $10 a bottle, just say so, and
stand firm, without embarrassment. There are plenty of decent, enjoyable
wines at that price.
87
Chapter 6: Navigating a Wine Shop
Five questions you should ask in a wine shop
 If a wine costs more than $10: What kind of
storage has this wine experienced? Hemming
and hawing on the part of the wine mer-
chant should be taken to mean, “Poor.”
 How long has this wine been in your store?
This is especially important if the store does
not have a climate-control system.
 What are some particularly good buys this
month? (Provided you trust the wine mer-
chant, and you don’t think he’s dumping
some overstocked, closeout wine on you.)
 If applicable: Why is this wine selling at such
a low price? The merchant might know that
the wine is too old, or is otherwise defec-
tive; unless he comes up with a believable
explanation, assume that’s the case.
 Will this wine go well with the food I’m plan-
ning to serve? The more information about
the recipe or main flavors you can provide,
the better your chance of getting a good
match.

W
hen you buy a bottle of wine in a restaurant, you get to taste it right
then and there: instant gratification. If you’ve chosen well, you have a
delicious wine that pairs beautifully with the food you’ve selected. You also
can bask in the compliments of your family and friends during the whole
meal and go home feeling good about yourself. If you haven’t chosen well . . .
well, we all know that feeling! Fortunately, practice does make perfect, at least
most of the time.
The Restaurant Wine Experience
Here and there, you might come across a restaurant with a retail wine shop
on the premises, a useful hybrid of a place where you can look over all the
bottles, read the labels, browse through wine books and magazines, and then
carry your chosen bottle to your table. Unfortunately, such establishments
are rarer than four-leaf clovers. In most restaurants, you have to choose your
wine from a menu that tells you only the names of the wines and the price
per bottle — and manages to make even that little bit of information some-
what incomprehensible. Welcome to the restaurant wine list.
Restaurant wine lists can be infuriating. Typically, they don’t tell you enough
about the wines. Sometimes, there’s nothing worth drinking, at least in your
price range; other times, you have so many choices that you’re immobilized.
All too frequently, the lists simply are not accurate; you spend ten good 
minutes of your life deciding which wine to order, only to discover that it’s
“not available tonight” (and probably hasn’t been for months).

When you eat out, you may not feel like wading through the restaurant’s wine
list at all, knowing that it can be an ego-deflating experience. But don’t give
up without a fight. With a little guidance and a few tips, you can navigate the
choppy waters of the wine list.
How Wine Is Sold in Restaurants
Believe it or not, restaurateurs really do want you to buy their wine. They usu-
ally make a sizable profit on every sale; their servers earn bigger tips and
become happier employees; and you enjoy your meal more, going home a
more satisfied customer.
But traditionally (and, we trust, unwittingly), many restaurants have done
more to hinder wine sales than to encourage them. Fortunately, the old ways
are changing. (Unfortunately, they’re changing slowly.)
Wines available for sale in a restaurant these days generally fall into four 
categories:
 The house wines, usually one white and one red, and sometimes also
a sparkling wine. These can be purchased by the glass or in a carafe
(a wide-mouthed, handle-less pitcher). They are the wines you get when
you simply ask for a glass of white or a glass of red.
 Premium wines, available by the glass. These offer a wider selection than
the house wines and are generally better quality. (These wines are usu-
ally available also by the bottle.)
 Wines available by the bottle from the restaurant’s regular, or standard,
wine list.
 Older or rarer wines available by the bottle from a special wine list,
sometimes called a reserve wine list (not every restaurant has this list).
The choice of the house
The wine list looks so imposing that you finally give up laboring over it.
You hand it back to the server and say (either a bit sheepishly, because
you’re acknowledging that you can’t handle the list, or with defiant bravado, 
signifying that you’re not going to waste your time on this nonsense), 
“I’ll just have a glass of white wine (or, ‘Chardonnay’).” Smart move or
big mistake?
90
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

You’ll probably know the answer to this question as soon as the house wine
hits your lips. It might be just what you wanted — and you avoided the effort
of plowing through that list. But in theory, we’d say, “Mistake.”
Usually, a restaurant’s house wines are inferior stuff that the restaurant owner
is making an enormous profit on. (Cost-per-ounce is usually a restaurant
owner’s main criterion in choosing a house wine.) House wines can range
in price from $4 up to $10 a glass (with an average of $6 to $8). Often, the
entire bottle costs the proprietor the price of one glass or less! No wonder
the “obliging” server fills your glass to the brim.
If you do choose a house wine, you usually save money if you buy it by the
carafe, if it’s offered that way. On the other hand, you may not want an entire
carafe of the house wine!
We’ve found that only a small percentage of better restaurants — and wine-
conscious restaurants, often located in enlightened places like Napa or
Sonoma — offer a house wine worth drinking. And it’s practically never a
good value. Under most circumstances, avoid the house wine. For the same
reasons, avoid asking for “a glass of Chardonnay” or “a glass of Merlot.”
If circumstances are such that a glass of wine makes the most sense (if you’re
the only one in your group who’s having wine with dinner, for example),
chances are you’ll need to order the house wine, unless you’re at a restaurant
that offers premium selections by the glass as well. If the house wine is your
only option, ask the server what it is. Don’t be satisfied with the response,
“It’s Chardonnay”; ask for specifics. Chardonnay from where? What brand?
Ask to see the bottle. Either your worst fears will be confirmed (you’ve never
heard of the wine, or it has a reputation for being inferior), or you’ll be pleas-
antly surprised (you have heard of the wine, and it has a good reputation).
At least you’ll know what you’re drinking, for future reference.
Premium pours
The word premium is used very loosely by the wine industry. You might think
that it refers to a rather high-quality wine, but when annual industry sales
statistics are compiled for the United States, premium indicates any wine
that sells for more than $7 a bottle in stores!
As used in the phrase premium wines by the glass, however, premium usually
does connote better quality. These are red and white wines that a restaurant
sells at a higher price than its basic house wines. (Oh, we get it: You pay a pre-
mium for them!) Premium wines are usually in the range of $9 to $14 per glass.
91
Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List

A restaurant may offer just one premium white and one red, or it may offer
several choices. These premium wines are not anonymous beverages, like the
house red and white, but are identified for you somehow — on the wine list,
on a separate card, verbally, or sometimes even by a display of bottles. (Why
would you ever pay a premium for them if you didn’t know what they were?)
In some informal restaurants, wines by the glass are listed on a chalkboard.
Ordering premium wines by the glass is a fine idea, especially if you want to
have only a glass or two or if you and your guests want to experiment by
trying several wines. Sometimes we order a glass of a premium white wine or
glass of Champagne as a starter and then go on to a bottle of red wine.
Of course, there’s a catch. Not every restaurant offers premium wines by the
glass. Also, you end up paying more for the wine if you order a bottle’s worth
of individual glasses than you would if you ordered a whole bottle to begin with.
If two or three of you are ordering the same wine by the glass — and espe-
cially if you might want refills — ask how many ounces are poured into each
glass (usually five to eight ounces) and compare the price with that of a 
25.4-ounce (750 ml) bottle of the same wine. (You usually do have the option
of buying an entire bottle.) Sometimes, for the cost of only three glasses you
can have the whole bottle.
Special, or reserve, wine lists
Some restaurants offer a special wine list of rare wines to supplement their
regular wine list. These special lists appeal to two types of customers: very
serious wine connoisseurs and “high rollers.” If you’re not in either category,
don’t even bother asking whether the restaurant has such a list. Then again,

The “wine-by-the-glass” challenge
We’re delighted to see that many restaurants
these days offer interesting selections of wine
by the glass. Wine by the glass is a growing
trend despite the challenges that it presents to
restaurateurs. Their main problem is preserving
the wine in all those open bottles. The more
wines a restaurant offers by the glass, the
greater the odds that there will be wine left over
in each bottle at the end of the evening, and those
wines won’t be fresh enough to serve the next
day. To solve this problem, restaurateurs must
have some sort of wine preservation system —
sometimes an attractive console behind the bar
that injects inert gas into the open bottles to dis-
place oxygen, or some simpler, behind-the-
scenes gadget to protect the leftover wine from
air. Otherwise, unless they’re lucky enough to
finish every bottle every night, they will waste
an enormous amount of wine. Their wine profits
will go right down the drain! (Or into the stew!)

if you’re not paying for the meal or if you seriously want to impress a client
or a date, you may want to look at it! Try to get help with the list from some
knowledgeable person on the restaurant staff, though: Any mistake you make
can be a costly one.
The (anything but) standard wine list
Most of the time, you’ll probably end up turning to the restaurant’s standard
wine list to choose your wine. Good luck!
We use the term standard wine list to distinguish a restaurant’s basic wine list
from its special, or reserve, wine list. Unfortunately, there’s nothing standard
about wine lists at all. They come in all sizes, shapes, degrees of detail, degrees
of accuracy, and degrees of user-friendliness (the latter usually ranging from
moderate to nil).
If you’re still hung up on the emotional-vulnerability potential of buying wine,
don’t even pick up a wine list. (Instead, turn to Chapter 6 and re-read our pep
talk about wine buying in the section, “Buying Wine Can Intimidate Anyone.”)
When you’re ready, read the following section to get a wine you’ll like — with
minimum angst.

Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List
When the restaurant doesn’t have 
an alcohol license, BYOB
In most places, establishments that sell 
alcohol beverages — both retail stores and 
restaurants — must be licensed by the govern-
ment, to assure that appropriate taxes are paid
and to aid in the enforcement of local laws.
Some restaurants don’t have liquor licenses due
to circumstance or choice, and therefore
cannot sell wine. In those restaurants, you can
BYOB (bring your own bottle) to enjoy with your
meal. (If you’re not sure of the restaurant’s
policy on BYOB, call ahead.)
Many Chinese restaurants fall into this cate-
gory, for example. (Asian cuisine can be difficult
to match with wine, but Champagne and
sparkling wine generally go well, as do Alsace
Gewurztraminer or off-dry German Riesling.)
Other examples include restaurants that have
recently opened and have not yet received their
liquor licenses, or restaurants that for some
reason do not qualify for a license. (They may
be located too close to a school or a church, for
example.)
We love BYOB restaurants! Not only do we
save money, but we can also bring the bottle of
our choice, and not deal with the wine list. You
may have to pay a small fee when you bring
your own wine — after all, the service staff han-
dles your bottle for you (see “Corkage fees”
later in the chapter), but in most cases you still
get a good deal.

How to Read a Wine List
Your first step in the dark encounter between you and the wine list is to size
up the opposition. You can do this by noting how the wine list is organized.
Read the headings on the wine list the way you’d read the chapter titles in a
book that you were considering buying. Figure out how the wines are catego-
rized and how they’re arranged within each category. Notice how much or
how little information is given about each wine. Check out the style of the
list: Does it seem pretentious or straightforward? Estimate the number of
wines on it — there can be 12 or 200. (An indirect benefit of this procedure
is that the purposeful look in your eyes as you peruse the list will convince
your guests that you know what you’re doing.)
Sometimes, the list is very small, with hardly any wines on it. It’s tough to
look purposeful for very long when you’re studying a list like that.
As soon as your server comes to the table, ask to see the wine list. Besides
communicating to the server that you feel comfortable with wine (whether
it’s true or not), your asking for the list quickly gives you more time to
study it.
Sizing up the organization of the list
There’s no way of predicting exactly what you’ll find on the list, other than
prices. Generally speaking, though, you may discover the wines arranged in
the following categories:
 Champagne and sparkling wines
 (Dry) white wines
 (Dry) red wines
 Dessert wines
After-dinner drinks like Cognac, Armagnac, single-malt Scotches, grappas, or
liqueurs usually do not appear on the list, or if they do, they have their own
section near the back of the list.
Some restaurants further subdivide the wines on their list according to 
country, especially in the white and red wine categories: French red wines,
Italian red wines, American reds, and so on. These country sections may
94
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

then be subdivided by wine region. France, for example, may have listings
of Bordeaux, Burgundy, and possibly Rhône all under French red wines.
USA reds may be divided into California wines, Oregon wines, and Washington
wines.
Or you may find that the categories under white wines and red wines 
are the names of grape varieties — for example, a Chardonnay section, a
Sauvignon Blanc section, and a miscellaneous other dry whites section, all
under the general heading of white wines. If the restaurant features a particu-
lar country’s cuisine, the wines of that country, say Italian, may be listed first
(and given certain prominence), followed by a cursory listing of wines from
other areas.
We’ve noticed two recent trends in wine-conscious restaurants, and we
applaud them both, because they make ordering easier and more fun:
 The so-called progressive wine list, in which wines appear in a pro-
gressive sequence under each category heading. For example, under
“Chardonnays,” the wines are arranged by weight and richness, pro-
gressing from the lightest wines to the most intense, regardless of price.
 Lists that use wine styles as their basic form of organization. In these
lists, the category headings are neither varietal nor regional, but describe
the taste of the wines in each category, such as “Fresh, crisp, unoaked
whites,” or “Full-bodied, serious reds.”
95
Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List
Wine list power struggles
In many restaurants, the servers don’t give you
enough time to study the wine list. (Really good
restaurants recognize that choosing a bottle of
wine can take some time.) If your waiter asks,
somewhat impatiently, “Have you selected your
wine yet?” simply tell him (firmly) that you need
more time. Don’t be bullied into making a hasty
choice.
Usually, your table will receive only one wine list.
An outmoded convention dictates that only the
host (the masculine is intentional) needs to see
the list. (It’s part of the same outmoded thinking
that dictates that females should receive menus
with no prices on them.) At our table of two,
there are two thinking, curious, decision-making
customers. We ask for a second list.
Invariably, the wine list is handed to the oldest
or most important-looking male at the table. If
you are a female entertaining business clients,
this situation can be insulting and infuriating.
Speak up and ask for a copy of the wine list for
yourself. If it’s important enough to you, slip
away from the table and inform the server that
you are the host of the table.

Getting a handle on the pricing
Often you’ll find that within each category, the wines appear in ascending order
of price with the least expensive wine first. Many a restaurateur is betting
that you won’t order that first wine out of fear of looking cheap. They figure
you’ll go for the second, third, or fourth wine down the price column or even
deeper if you’re feeling insecure and need the reassurance that your choice is
a good one. (Meanwhile, that least expensive wine may be perfectly fine.)
What the wine list should tell you
The more serious a restaurant is about its wine selection, the more informa-
tion it gives you about each wine.
Here’s some information you’re likely to find on the wine list:
 An item number for each wine. These are sometimes called bin numbers,
referring to the specific location of each wine in the restaurant’s cellar
or wine storage room.
Item numbers make it easier for the server to locate and pull the wine
quickly for you. They’re also a crutch to help the server bring you the
right wine in case he doesn’t have a clue about wine, not to mention a
crutch for you in ordering the wine in case you don’t have a clue how to
pronounce what you’ve decided to drink. (And you can always pretend
that you’re using the number for the waiter’s benefit.)
 The name of each wine. These names may be grape names or place-names
(see Chapter 4), but they had better also include the name of each pro-
ducer (Château this or that, or such-and-such Winery), or you’ll have no
way of knowing exactly which wine any listing is meant to represent.
 A vintage indication for each wine — the year that the grapes were 
harvested. If the wine is a blend of wines from different years, it may say
NV, for non-vintage. (Chapter 4 tells you why non-vintage wines exist.)
Sometimes, you’ll see VV, which means that the wine is a vintage-dated
wine, but you’re not allowed to know which vintage it is unless you ask.
The restaurateur just doesn’t want to bother changing the year on the
list when the wine’s vintage changes. We’re always annoyed when we
see lists that don’t name the wine’s vintage.
 Sometimes, a brief description of the wines — but this is unlikely if
dozens of wines are on the list.
 Sometimes, suggestions from the restaurateur for certain wines to pair
with certain dinner entrées. In our experience, this information is helpful
at times, but you may not always like — or agree with — their wine 
suggestion.
 Prices. There will always be a price for each wine.
96
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

Assessing the list’s style
Once upon a time, the best wine lists consisted of hand-lettered pages inside
heavy leather covers embossed with the words Carte des Vins in gold. Today,
the best wine lists are more likely to be laser-printed pages or cards that
more than make up in functionality what they sacrifice in romance.
The more permanent and immutable a wine list seems, the less accurate its
listings are likely to be — and the less specific. Such lists suggest that no one
is really looking after wine on a day-to-day basis in that restaurant. Chances
are that many of the wines listed will be out of stock.
Sometimes, the list of wines is actually included on the restaurant’s menu,
especially if the menu is a computer-printed page or two that changes from
week to week or from month to month. Restaurants featuring immediate, 
up-to-date wine listings like this can be a good bet for wine.
Digital browsing
A few restaurants have dared to go where no wine list has gone before: into the
digital realm. Their wine lists — at least a few copies of them — are on portable
computer screens, or e-books, that enable you not only to see the list of avail-
able wines and their prices, but also to read background information by tapping
a wine’s name; you can even request a list of wines that are suitable for the food
you’re ordering. Of course, these lists have their downside: They’re so much
fun that you risk offending your friends by playing with the list for too long!
Many restaurants that are serious about wine publish their wine lists on the
Internet. Before a special meal, you can go to the restaurant’s Web site and
make a short list of possible wines for your meal — guaranteed to boost your
comfort level.
97
Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List
The lowdown on high prices
Most restaurateurs count on wine and liquor
sales to provide a disproportionate percentage
of their business profit. The typical restaurant,
therefore, charges two to two-and-a-half
(sometimes three!) times the retail store price
for a bottle of wine. That means that the restau-
rant is earning three to four times the price it
paid for the bottle.
Admittedly, restaurateurs incur costs for wine
storage, glasses, breakage, service, and so on.
But those costs don’t justify such extraordinary
markups, in the eyes of most wine drinkers.
Some savvy restaurateurs have discovered that
by marking up their wines less, they actually sell
more wine and make more money in the end.
We try to patronize those restaurants.

Ordering Your Wine
Plan to order the wine at the same time that you order the food — if not
sooner; otherwise, you may be sipping water with your first course. If, after
sizing up the wine list, you decide that you aren’t familiar with most of the
wines on it, ask for help with your selection.
If the restaurant is a fancy one, ask whether there’s a sommelier (pronounced
som-mel-yay) — technically, a specially trained, high-level wine specialist
who is responsible for putting the wine list together and for making sure
that the wines offered on the list complement the cuisine of the restaurant.
(Unfortunately, not all restaurants employ one — usually only the most wine-
conscious.) If the restaurant is not particularly fancy, ask to speak with the
wine specialist. Often someone on the staff, frequently the proprietor, knows
the wine list well.
If someone on the restaurant staff knows the wine list well, this person is your
best bet to help you select a wine. He or she will usually know what wines go
best with the food you are ordering. He will also be extremely appreciative of
your interest in the list. For these reasons, even though we are familiar with
wine, we often consult the sommelier, proprietor, or wine specialist for sug-
gestions from the wine list.
Here are some face-saving methods of getting help choosing a wine:
 If you aren’t sure how to pronounce the wine’s name, point to it on the
list, or use the wine’s item or bin number (if there is one).
 Point out two or three wines on the list to the sommelier or server and
say, “I’m considering these wines. Which one do you recommend?”
This is also a subtle way of communicating your price range.
 Ask to see one or two bottles; your familiarity with the labels, seeing the
name of an importer whose other wines you have enjoyed, or some other
aspect of the label may help you make up your mind.
 Ask whether there are any half-bottles (375 ml) or 500 ml bottles avail-
able. Sometimes they’re not listed, but smaller bottles give you wider
possibilities in ordering: For example, you might drink one half-bottle of
white wine and a half or full (750 ml) bottle of red wine.
 Mention the food you plan to order and ask for suggestions of wines that
would complement the meal.
We realize that you can’t remember all the wines that we recommend in this
book when you’re dining out, so we list, in Table 7-1, a few types of wine that
are on most restaurant wine lists and that we believe are consistently reliable
choices with food.

Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List

Handling the Wine Presentation Ritual
In many restaurants, the wine presentation occurs with such solemnity and
ceremony that you’d think you were involved in high church or temple services.
The hushed tones of the waiter, the ritualized performance — the seriousness
of it all can make you want to laugh (but that seems wrong — like laughing
in church). At the very least, you might be tempted to tell your waiter,
“Lighten up! It’s just a bottle of fermented fruit juice!”
Actually, though, there’s some logic behind the Wine Presentation Ritual.
Step by step, the Ritual (and the logic) goes like this:
1. The waiter or sommelier presents the bottle to you (assuming that you
are the person who ordered the wine) for inspection.
The point of this procedure is to make sure that the bottle is the bottle
you ordered. Check the label carefully. In our experience, 15 to 20 per-
cent of the time it’s the wrong bottle or not the vintage shown on the
list. Feel the bottle with your hand, if you like, to determine whether its
temperature seems to be correct. (This is also a good time for you to
pretend to recognize something about the label, as if the wine is an old
friend, even if you’ve never seen it before.) If you’re satisfied with the
bottle, nod your approval to the server.
2. The server removes the cork and places it in front of you.
The purpose of this step is for you to determine, by smelling and visually
inspecting the cork, whether the cork is in good condition, and whether
the cork seems to be the legitimate cork for that bottle of wine.
In rare instances, a wine may be so corky (see Chapter 2) that the cork
itself will have an unpleasant odor. On even rarer occasions, the cork
might be totally wet and shriveled or very dry and crumbly; either 
situation suggests that air has gotten into the wine and spoiled it.
Once in your life, you may discover a vintage year or winery name
on your cork. But most of the time, the presentation of the cork is 
inconsequential.
If the cork does raise your suspicions, you should still wait to smell or
taste the wine itself before deciding whether to reject the bottle.
Once, when one of our wise-guy friends was presented the cork by the
server, he proceeded to put it into his mouth and chew it, and then he
pronounced to the waiter that it was just fine!
3. If your wine needs decanting, the server decants it.
For more information on decanting, see Chapter 8.
4. The server pours a small amount of wine into your glass and waits.
100
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

At this point, you’re not supposed to say, “Is that all you’re giving me?!”
You’re expected to take a sniff of the wine, perhaps a little sip, and then
either nod your approval to the waiter or murmur, “It’s fine.” Actually,
this is an important step of the Ritual because if something is wrong with
the wine, now is the time to return it — not after you’ve finished half of
the bottle! For a review of wine-tasting technique, turn to Chapter 2
before you head out to the restaurant.
If you’re not really sure whether the condition of the wine is acceptable,
ask for someone else’s opinion at your table and then make a group deci-
sion; otherwise, you risk feeling foolish by either returning the bottle later
when it’s been declared defective by one of your guests, or by drinking
the stuff when it becomes clear to you later that there’s something wrong
with it. Either way, you suffer. Take as long as you need to on this step.
If you do decide that the bottle is out of condition, describe to the server
what you find wrong with the wine, using the best language you can. (Musty
or dank are descriptors that are easily understood.) Be sympathetic to the
fact that you’re causing more work for him, but don’t be overly apologetic.
(Why should you be? You didn’t make the wine!) Let him smell or taste
the wine himself if he would like. But don’t let him make you feel guilty.
Depending on whether the sommelier or captain agrees that it’s a bad
bottle or whether he believes that you just don’t understand the wine,
he may bring you another bottle of the same, or he may bring you the
wine list so that you can select a different wine. Either way, the Ritual
begins again from the top.
5. If you do accept the wine, the waiter pours the wine into your guests’
glasses and then finally into yours.
Now you’re allowed to relax.
101
Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List
Twice the price
A few profit-minded restaurateurs train their
servers to maximize wine sales in every way
possible — even at the customers’ expense. For
example, some servers are trained to refill wine
glasses liberally so that the bottle is emptied
before the main course arrives. (This can
happen all the more easily when the glasses are
large.) Upon emptying the bottle, the server
asks, “Shall I bring another bottle of the same
wine?” Depending on how much wine is in
everyone’s glass and how much wine your
guests tend to drink, you may not need another
bottle, but your tendency will be to say yes to
avoid looking stingy.
An even trickier practice is to refill the glasses
starting with the host, so that the bottle runs dry
before each of the guests has had a refill. How
can you refuse a second bottle at the expense of
your guests’ enjoyment?! You’ll have to order that
second bottle — and you should let the manager
know how you feel about it when you leave. (But
remember, these nefarious restaurant practices
are the exception rather than the rule.)

Restaurant Wine Tips
Drinking wine in a restaurant requires so many decisions that you really do
need a guidebook. Should you leave the wine in an ice bucket? What should
you do if the wine is bad? And can you bring your own wine? Let the follow-
ing tips guide you:
 Can I kick the ice-bucket habit? Most servers assume that an ice bucket
is necessary to chill white wines and sparkling wines. But sometimes the
bottle is already so cold when it comes to you that the wine would be
better off warming up a bit on the table. If your white wine goes into an
ice bucket and you think it’s getting too cold, remove it from the bucket,
or have the waiter remove it. Just because that ice bucket is sitting there
on your table (or next to your table) doesn’t mean that your bottle has
to be in it!
Sometimes, a red wine that’s a bit too warm can benefit from five or ten
minutes in an ice bucket. (But be careful! It can get too cold very quickly.)
If the server acts as if you’re nuts to chill a red wine, ignore him.
 What’s with these tiny glasses? When various glasses are available, you
can exercise your right to choose a different glass from the one you were
given. If the restaurant’s red wine glass is quite small, a stemmed water
glass might be more appropriate for the red wine.
 Should the wine “breathe”? If a red wine you ordered needs aeration to
soften its harsh tannins (see Chapter 8), merely pulling the cork will be
practically useless in accomplishing that (because the air space at the
neck of the bottle is too small). Decanting the bottle or pouring the wine
into glasses is the best tactic.
102
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
Ladies first?
Almost all restaurant waiters pour, and re-pour,
wine for the women at the table first. What’s
wrong with that? Well, one of us, who otherwise
is not a male chauvinist, doesn’t like that idea
because most of the time the females at the
table are not drinking as much wine as he is.
Quite frequently, the last part of the bottle will
go into the glasses of the women, who often
don’t drink it, while the male(s) have empty
glasses in front of them, forcing them to order
another bottle or do without. Since we’re all for
equality between the sexes, how about pouring
the wine into the emptiest glasses, regardless
of sex?

 Where’s my bottle? We prefer to have our bottle of wine on or near our
table, not out of our reach. We can look at the label that way, and we
don’t have to wait for the server to remember to refill our glasses, either.
(Okay, call us controlling.)
 What if the bottle is bad? Refuse any bottle that tastes or smells
unpleasant (unless you brought it yourself!). A good restaurateur will
always replace the wine, even if he thinks there’s nothing wrong with it.
 May I bring my own wine? Some restaurants allow you to bring your
own wine — especially if you express the desire to bring a special wine,
or an older wine. Restaurants will usually charge a corkage fee (a fee for
wine service, use of the glasses, and so on) that can vary from $10 to $25
a bottle, depending on the attitude of the restaurant. You should never
bring a wine that is already on the restaurant’s wine list; it’s cheap and
insulting. (Call and ask the restaurant when you’re not sure whether the
wine is on its list.) Anyway, you certainly should call ahead to determine
whether it’s possible to bring wine (in some places, the restaurant’s
license prohibits it) and to ask what the corkage fee is.
 What if I’m traveling abroad? If you journey to countries where wine
is made, such as France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Greece,
Spain, or Portugal, by all means try the local wines. They will be fresher
than the imports, in good condition, and the best values on the wine list.
It doesn’t make sense to order French wines, such as Bordeaux or
Burgundy, in Italy, for example. Or California Cabernets in Paris.
103
Chapter 7: Confronting a Restaurant Wine List
Wine bars
Wine bars are popping up everywhere, not just
in London, Italy, and Paris. Wine bars are estab-
lishments that offer an extensive choice of
wines by the glass — from 12 to 100 — as well
as simple food to accompany the wines. The
wine bottles are usually either hooked up to an
inert-gas injection system after being opened,
which keeps the wine fresh, or are topped up
with inert gas from a free-standing dispenser at
the end of each evening. The former system
often makes a dramatic centerpiece behind
the bar.
In wine bars, you are sometimes offered a
choice of two different sizes of wines by the
glass. You can have a taste of a wine (about two-
and-a-half ounces) for one price, or a glass of a
wine (often five ounces) for another price. And
you can often order a flight of wines — several
similar wines served side by side so that you
can compare them.
Wine bars are the ideal way to try lots of different
wines by the glass — an educational as well as
a satisfying experience. We love them! Hopefully,
their numbers will increase with the years.

H
ave you ever broken a cork while trying to extract it from the bottle, or
taken an unusually long time to remove a stubborn cork, while your
guests smiled at you uneasily? This has certainly happened to us from time
to time and probably to just about everyone else who has ever pulled a cork
out of a bottle of wine. It’s enough to give anyone a case of corkophobia!
Removing the cork from a wine bottle is the first challenge that faces you in
your quest to enjoy wine, and it’s a big one. (Fortunately, once you get the
hang of it, it’s easy — most of the time.) Afterwards, there are the niggling
details of wine service, such as which type of glass to use and what to do if
you don’t finish the whole bottle. But help is at hand for the wine-challenged!
Getting the Cork Out
Before you can even think about removing the cork from a wine bottle, you
need to deal with whatever covers the cork. Most wine bottles have a colorful
covering over the top of the bottle that’s called a capsule. Wineries place cap-
sules on top of the corks for two reasons: to keep the corks clean, and to
create a fetching look for their bottles.

These days, many wineries use colored foil or plastic capsules rather than
the traditional lead capsules. In keeping with the sheerness trend in fashion,
some wineries use a transparent cellophane covering that lets the cork show
through; sometimes, the sheer look graces special flange-top bottles, a fancy
wine bottle with a protruding, flat lip at the top. (Some flange-top bottles sport
colorful plastic plugs on top of the cork instead of cellophane.) The flange-top
seems to be going out of style, and that’s fortunate because many corkscrews
just didn’t fit over its wide top!
Whether the capsule is plastic, foil, or cellophane, we usually remove the entire
capsule, so that no wine can possibly come into contact with the covering
when we pour. (We use the small knife that’s part of most corkscrews — the
devices that exist solely for opening wine bottles.) When we encounter a
plastic plug atop the cork instead of a capsule, we just flick it off with the
tip of a knife.
After removing the capsule or plug, we wipe clean the top of the bottle with
a damp cloth. Sometimes the visible end of the cork is dark with mold that
developed under the capsule, and in that case, we wipe all the more dili-
gently. (If you encounter mold atop the cork, don’t be concerned. That mold
is actually a good sign: It means that the wine has been stored in humid 
conditions. See Chapter 16 for information on humidity and other aspects
of wine storage.)
Sometimes wine lovers just can’t bring themselves to remove the whole 
capsule out of respect for the bottle of wine that they are about to drink.
(In fact, traditional wine etiquette dictates that you not remove the entire
capsule.) Many people use a gizmo called a foil cutter that sells for about
$6 or $7 in wine shops, kitchen stores, or specialty catalogs. However, the
foil cutter does not cut the capsule low enough, in our opinion, to prevent
wine from dripping over the edge of the foil into your glass. If you want to
leave the capsule on, use the corkscrew’s knife to cut the foil under the
second lip of the bottle, approximately three-fourths of an inch from 
the top.
The corkscrew not to use
The one corkscrew we absolutely avoid happens to be the most common type
of corkscrew around. We don’t like it for one very simple reason: It mangles
the cork, almost guaranteeing that brown flakes will be floating in your glass
of wine. (We also don’t like it because it offends our sense of righteousness
that an inferior product should be so popular.)

That corkscrew is the infamous Wing Type Corkscrew, a bright silver-colored,
metal device that looks like a cross between a pair of pliers and a drill; when
you insert this corkscrew into a cork, two “wings” open out from the side of
the corkscrew. The major shortcoming of this device is its very short worm,
or auger (the curly prong that bores into the cork), which is too short for
many corks and overly aggressive on all of them.
Rather than finding out the hard way that this corkscrew just doesn’t cut it
(or, literally, cuts it too much!), as we did, invest a few dollars in a decent
corkscrew right off the bat. The time and hassle you’ll save will be more than
worth the investment. Of the many types of wine-bottle openers available, we
recommend the three described in the following sections.
The corkscrew to buy
The one indispensable corkscrew for every household is the Screwpull. It
was invented in the early 1980s by a renowned Houston scientist, Dr. Herbert
Allen, who was apparently tired of having a ten-cent piece of cork get the
better of him.
The Screwpull is about six inches long. It consists of an arched piece of plas-
tic (which looks like a clothespin on steroids) straddling an inordinately long,
5-inch worm that’s coated with Teflon (see Figure 8-1).
To use this corkscrew, you simply place the plastic over the bottle top
(having removed the capsule), until a lip on the plastic is resting on the top
of the bottle. Insert the worm through the plastic, until it touches the cork.
Hold on to the plastic firmly while turning the lever atop the worm clockwise.
The worm descends into the cork. Then you simply keep turning the lever in
the same clockwise direction, and the cork magically emerges from the bottle.
To remove the cork from the Screwpull, simply turn the lever counterclock-
wise while holding on to the cork.

Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

The Screwpull comes in many colors and costs about $20 in wine shops,
kitchen stores, and specialty catalogs. It’s very simple to use, does not
require a lot of muscle, and is our corkscrew of choice for most of the corks
that we encounter.
It has one drawback; because it’s made of plastic, it can break. But now a
stainless steel version is available, for about $30. This Screwpull should last
indefinitely.
Other corkscrews worth owning
Although we favor the Screwpull for removing corks, we have two other cork-
screws for the remaining corks that the Screwpull can’t remove. Flange-top
bottles, for example, really challenge the Screwpull because of their unusual
width at the top.
Our two alternative corkscrews are smaller devices that — besides working
better now and then — can conveniently fit into your pants or apron pocket.
Their size is one reason that servers in restaurants favor them.
The two-pronged type that they use in California
One is called, unofficially, the Ah-So because (according to wine legend,
anyway) when people finally figure out how it works, they say, “Ah, so that’s
how it works!” (It’s also known as the “Butler’s Friend” — but where have all
the butlers gone?)
It’s a simple device made up of two thin, flat metal prongs, one slightly longer
than the other (see Figure 8-2). To use it, you slide the prongs down into the
tight space between the cork and the bottle (inserting the longer prong first),
using a back-and-forth seesaw motion until the top of the Ah-So is resting on
the top of the cork. Then you twist the cork while gently pulling it up.

Figure 8-2:
The Ah-So
corkscrew.
108
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

One advantage of the Ah-So is that it delivers an intact cork — without a hole
in it — that can be reused to close bottles of homemade vinegar, or to make
cutesy bulletin boards.
Although more difficult to operate than the Screwpull, the Ah-So really comes
into its own with very tight-fitting corks that no other corkscrews, including
the Screwpull, seem to be able to budge. Also, the Ah-So can be effective with
old, crumbly corks that don’t give other corkscrews much to grip.
The Ah-So is useless with loose corks that move around in the bottle’s neck
when you try to remove them. It just pushes those corks down into the wine.
At that point, you’ll need another tool called a cork retriever (which we describe
in the “Waiter, there’s cork in my wine!” section, later in this chapter).
The Ah-So sells for around $6 to $9. It seems to be especially popular in
California for no particular reason that we’ve ever been able to figure out.
The most professional corkscrew of them all
Our final recommended corkscrew, probably the most commonly used
corkscrew in restaurants all over the world, is simply called the Waiter’s
Corkscrew. A straight or gently curved base holds three devices that fold into
it, like a Swiss Army knife: a lever; a worm; and a small knife (see Figure 8-3).
The latter is especially handy for removing the capsule from the bottle.
© Akira Chiwaki
Using the Waiter’s Corkscrew requires some practice. First, wrap your fist
around the bottle’s neck. The trick then is to guide the worm down through
the center of the cork, by turning the corkscrew; turn slowly at first, until
you’re sure that the worm is not off center and actually is descending down
the middle of the cork. After the worm is fully descended into the cork, place
the lever on the lip of the bottle and push against the lever while pulling the
cork up. Give a firm tug at the very end or wiggle the bottom of the cork out
with your hand.
Figure 8-3:
The Waiter’s
Corkscrew.
109
Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

If your cork ever breaks and part of it gets stuck in the neck of the bottle, the
Waiter’s Corkscrew is indispensable for removing the remaining piece. Use the
method we just described, but insert the worm at a 45-degree angle. In most
cases, you will successfully remove the broken cork.
The Waiter’s Corkscrew sells for as little as $7, but designer versions can cost
more than ten times that much.
The status corkscrews
You can buy some really fancy corkscrews, some that attach to a counter or
a bar, which will cost you $100-plus. Yes, most of them work very well, after
you get the hang of them, but frankly, we don’t see the need to spend that
much on a corkscrew. We’d rather spend it on the wine!
Waiter, there’s cork in my wine!
Every now and then, even if you’ve used the right corkscrew and used it
properly, you can still have pieces of cork floating in your wine. They can be
tiny dry flakes that crumbled into the bottle, actual chunks of cork, or even
the entire cork.
Before you start berating yourself for being a klutz, you should know that
“floating cork” has happened to all of us at one time or another, no matter
how experienced we are. Cork won’t harm the wine. And besides, there’s a
wonderful instrument called a cork retriever (no, it’s not a small dog from the
south of Ireland!) available in specialty stores and in catalogs, although it’s
considerably more difficult to find than a corkscrew.
110
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
Why is my cork blue?
Have you ever opened a bottle of wine and dis-
covered that the “cork” is not cork at all, but
plastic — and brightly colored, to boot?
While we appreciate the touch of whimsy that an
orange or blue cork contributes, we are not fans
of plastic corks. Winemakers are understandably
disillusioned with cork itself because it can taint
a wine with off-aromas. But if you’re going to
invent an alternative to cork, why plug the bottle
neck with yet another closure that’s a rude bar-
rier between wine drinkers and their wine,
demanding the same, complicated tool as a
cork does — and can be even more difficult to
remove?! Fortunately, some new versions of syn-
thetic corks are relatively user-friendly compared
to earlier types. But screwcaps are even more so.

The cork retriever consists of three 10-inch pieces of stiff metal wire with hooks
on the ends. This device is remarkably effective for removing floating pieces of
cork from the bottle. We have even removed a whole cork from the neck with a
cork retriever (fearing the whole time that the bottle neck would explode when
we tried to force the cork and the retriever back up through the tiny diameter).
Alternatively, you can just pick out the offending piece(s) of cork with a spoon
after you pour the wine into your glass. (That’s one occasion when it’s rude
to serve your guest first, because the first glass has more cork pieces in it.)
Or you can pour the wine through a paper coffee filter (preferably the natural
brown-paper filter, or a filter rinsed with hot water to remove the chemicals)
into a decanter or pitcher to catch the remaining pieces of cork.
A special case: Opening Champagne 
and sparkling wine
Opening a bottle of sparkling wine is usually an exciting occasion. Who doesn’t
enjoy the ceremony of a cold glass of bubbly? But you need to use a com-
pletely different technique than you’d use to open a regular wine bottle.
The cork even looks different. Sparkling wine corks have a mushroom-shaped
head that protrudes from the bottle and a wire cage that holds the cork in
place against the pressure that’s trapped inside the bottle.
Never, ever use a corkscrew on a bottle of sparkling wine. The pressure of
the trapped carbonation, when suddenly released, can send the cork and
corkscrew flying right into your eye.
Forget how they do it in locker rooms
If your bottle of bubbly has just traveled, let it rest for a while, preferably a
day. Controlling the cork is difficult when the carbonation has been stirred
up. (Hey, you wouldn’t open a large bottle of soda that’s warm and shaken up,
either, would you? Sparkling wine has much more carbonated pressure than
soda, and needs more time to settle down.)
If you’re in the midst of a sparkling wine emergency and need to open the
bottle anyway, one quick solution is to calm down the carbonation by sub-
merging the bottle in an ice bucket for about 30 minutes. (Fill the bucket with
one-half ice cubes and one-half ice-cold water.)
In any case, be careful when you remove the wire cage, and keep one hand on
top of the cork as a precaution. (We had a hole in our kitchen ceiling from one
adventure with a flying cork.) Be sure to point the bottle away from people
and other fragile objects.
111
Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

A sigh is better than a pop
If you like to hear the cork pop, just yank it out. When you do that, however,
you’ll lose some of the precious wine, which will froth out of the bottle. Also,
the noise can interfere with your guests’ conversation. Besides, it ain’t too
classy!
Removing the cork from sparkling wine with just a gentle sigh rather than a
loud pop is fairly easy. Simply hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle with a
towel wrapped around it if it’s wet. (Try resting the base of the bottle on your
hipbone.) Twist the bottle while holding on to the cork so that you can con-
trol the cork as it emerges. When you feel the cork starting to come out of the
bottle, push down against the cork with some pressure, as if you don’t want to
let it out of the bottle. In this way, the cork will emerge slowly with a hiss or
sigh sound rather than a pop.
Every once in a while, you’ll come across a really tight sparkling wine cork
that doesn’t want to budge. Try running the top of the bottle under warm
water for a few moments, or wrapping a towel around the cork to create 
friction. Either action will usually enable you to remove the cork.
Another option is to purchase a fancy gadget that you place around the
part of the cork that’s outside the bottle. (There are actually three gadgets:
Champagne Pliers, a Champagne Star, and a Champagne Key.) Or you could
probably try using regular pliers, although lugging in the toolbox will surely
change the mood of the occasion.
112
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
The comeback of the screwcap
Instead of imitation cork (see the sidebar “Why
is my cork blue?”), we’d prefer to see real
screwcaps on most wine bottles. Screwcaps
are perfectly sound closures, technically speak-
ing. And they prevent “cork taint,” a chemical
flaw affecting a small percentage of corks, and
consequently the wine in those bottles. A
“corky” wine — that is, one affected with cork
taint — is damaged either slightly or flagrantly.
In the worst-case scenarios, corky wines give
off an offensive odor similar to moldy or damp
cardboard.
Formerly, only cheap, lower-quality wines had
screwcap closures. But in the past few years,
more and more wine producers have switched
from corks to screwcaps. For example, a number
of New Zealand and Australian wineries are
now using screwcaps, especially for their white
wines. Some Swiss producers have been using
screwcaps for their quality wines for years now,
especially for half-bottles. And now some
California producers, notably Bonny Doon, are
dressing their bottles with screwcaps. Is this
the start of a movement? Fine with us.

Does Wine Really Breathe?
Most wine is alive in the sense that it changes chemically as it slowly grows
older. Wine absorbs oxygen and, like our own cells, it oxidizes. When the
grapes turn into wine in the first place, they give off carbon dioxide, just like
us. So we suppose you could say that wine breathes, in a sense. But that’s not
what the server means when he asks, “Shall I pull the cork and let the wine
breathe, sir (or madam)?”
The term breathing refers to the process of aerating the wine, exposing it to
air. Sometimes the aroma and flavor of a very young wine will improve with
aeration. But just pulling the cork out of the bottle and letting the bottle sit
there is a truly ineffective way to aerate the wine. The little space at the neck
of the bottle is way too small to allow your wine to breathe very much.
How to aerate your wine
If you really want to aerate your wine, do one or both of the following:
 Pour the wine into a decanter (a fancy word for a glass container that is
big enough to hold the contents of an entire bottle of wine).
 Pour the wine into large glasses at least ten minutes before you plan to
drink it.
Practically speaking, it doesn’t matter what your decanter looks like or how
much it costs. In fact, the very inexpensive, wide-mouthed carafes are fine.
Which wines need aerating?
Many red wines but only a few white wines — and some dessert wines — can
benefit from aeration. You can drink most white wines upon pouring, unless
they’re too cold, but that’s a discussion for later.
Young, tannic red wines
Young, tannic red wines (see Chapter 2 for more on tannin) — such as
Cabernet Sauvignons, Bordeaux, many wines from the northern Rhône
Valley, and many Italian wines — actually taste better with aeration because
their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh.
113
Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

The younger and more tannic the wine is, the longer it needs to breathe. As a
general rule, most tannic, young red wines soften up with one hour of aera-
tion. A glaring exception to the one-hour rule would be many young Barolos
or Barbarescos (red wines from Piedmont, Italy, which you can read about in
Chapter 10); these wines are frequently so tannic that they can really make
your mouth pucker. They often can benefit from three or four hours of aeration.
Older red wines with sediment
Many red wines develop sediment (tannin and other matter in the wine that
solidifies over time) usually after about eight years of age. You will want to
remove the sediment because it can taste a bit bitter. Also, the dark particles
floating in your wine, usually at the bottom of your glass, don’t look very
appetizing.
To remove sediment, keep the bottle of wine upright for a day or two before
you plan to open it so that the sediment settles at the bottom of the bottle.
Then decant the wine carefully: Pour the wine out of the bottle slowly into a
decanter while watching the wine inside the bottle as it approaches the neck.
You watch the wine so that you can stop pouring when you see cloudy wine
from the bottom of the bottle making its way to the neck. If you stop pouring
at the right moment, all the cloudy wine remains behind in the bottle.
To actually see the wine inside the bottle as you pour, you need to have a
bright light shining through the bottle’s neck. Candles are commonly used for
this purpose, and they are romantic, but a flashlight standing on end works
even better. (It’s brighter, and it doesn’t flicker.) Or simply hold the bottle up
to a bright light, and pour slowly. Stop pouring the wine into the decanter
when you reach the sediment, toward the bottom of the bottle.
The older the wine, the more delicate it can be. Don’t give old, fragile-looking
wines excessive aeration. (Look at the color of the wine through the bottle
before you decant; if it looks pale, the wine could be pretty far along its matu-
rity curve.) The flavors of really old wines will start fading rapidly after 10 or
15 minutes of being exposed to air.
If the wine needs aeration after decanting (that is, it still tastes a bit harsh),
let it breathe in the open decanter. If the wine has a dark color, chances are
that it is still quite youthful and needs to breathe more. Conversely, if the
wine has a brick red or pale garnet color, it probably has matured and may
not need much aeration.
A few white wines
Some very good, dry white wines — such as full-bodied white Burgundies and
white Bordeaux wines, as well as the best Alsace whites — also get better with
aeration. For example, if you open a young Corton-Charlemagne (a great white
Burgundy), and it doesn’t seem to be showing much aroma or flavor, chances
are that it needs aeration. Decant it and taste it again in half an hour. In most
cases, the wine dramatically improves.
114
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

Vintage Ports
One of the most famous fortified wines is Vintage Port (properly called
“Porto”). We discuss this wine and others like it in Chapter 15.
For now, we’ll just say that, yes, Vintage Port needs breathing lessons, and
needs them very much, indeed! Young Vintage Ports are so brutally tannic
that they demand many hours of aeration (eight would not be too many).
Even older Ports improve with four hours or more of aeration. Older Vintage
Ports require decanting for another reason: They’re chock-full of sediment.
(Often, large flakes of sediment fill the bottom 10 percent of the bottle.)
Keep Vintage Ports standing for several days before you open them.
Exceptions to the “decant your red wines and Ports” rule
The exceptions prove the rule. The majority of red wines you drink don’t
require decanting, aeration, or any special preparation other than pulling
out the cork and having a glass handy.
The following red wines do not need decanting:
 Light- and medium-bodied, less tannic red wines, such as Pinot Noirs,
Burgundies, Beaujolais, and Côtes du Rhônes; lighter red Zinfandels;
and less imposing Italian reds, such as Dolcettos, Barberas, and lighter
Chiantis. These wines don’t have much tannin and, therefore, don’t need
much aeration.
 Inexpensive (less than $12) red wines. Same reason as the preceding.
 Tawny ports — in fact, any other Ports except Vintage Ports. These wines
should be free from sediment (which stayed behind in the barrels where
the wine aged) and are ready to drink when you pour them.
Does the Glass Really Matter?
If you’re just drinking wine as refreshment with your meal, and you aren’t
thinking about the wine much as it goes down, the glass you use probably
doesn’t matter too much. A jelly glass? Why not? Plastic glasses? We’ve used
them dozens of times on picnics, not to mention in airplanes (where the
wine’s quality usually doesn’t demand great glasses, anyway).
But if you have a good wine, a special occasion, friends who want to talk about
the wine with you, or the boss for dinner, stemware (glasses with stems) is
called for. And it’s not just a question of etiquette and status: Good wine tastes
better out of good glasses. Really.
115
Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

Think of wine glasses as being like stereo speakers. Any old speaker brings
the music to your ears, just like any old glass brings the wine to your lips.
But (assuming that you care to notice it) can’t you appreciate the sound so
much more, aesthetically and emotionally, from good speakers? The same
principle holds true with wine and wine glasses. You can appreciate wine’s
aroma and flavor complexities so much more out of a fine wine glass.
The medium is the message.
The right color: none
Good wine glasses are always clear. (It’s okay for jelly glasses to have pictures
of the Flintstones on them, as long as the background is clear.) Those pretty
pink or green glasses may look nice in your china cabinet, but they interfere
with your ability to distinguish the true colors of the wine.
Thin but not tiny
Believe it or not (we didn’t always), the taste of a wine changes when you
drink the wine out of different types of glasses. A riot almost broke out at one
wine event we organized because the same wine tasted so different in differ-
ent glasses that the tasters thought we served them different wines — and
that we had just pretended it was all the same wine, to fool them. We learned
that three aspects of a glass are important: its size, its shape, and the thick-
ness of the glass.
Size
For dry red and white wine, small glasses are all wrong — besides that,
they’re a pain in the neck. You just can’t swirl the wine around in those
little glasses without spilling it, which makes appreciating the aroma of
the wine almost impossible. And furthermore, who wants to bother continu-
ally refilling them? Small glasses can work adequately only for sherry or
dessert wines, which have strong aromas to begin with and are generally 
consumed in smaller quantities than table wines. In most cases, larger is 
usually better.
Matching glass size to wine works like this:
 Glasses for red wines should hold a minimum of 12 ounces; many of the
best glasses have capacities ranging from 16 to 24 ounces, or more.
 For white wines, 10 to 12 ounces should be the minimum capacity.
 For sparkling wines, an 8 to 12 ounce capacity is fine.
116
Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 

Thickness and shape
Stemware made of very thin, fine crystal costs a lot more than normal glasses.
That’s one reason why many people don’t use it, and why some people do.
The better reason for using fine crystal is that the wine tastes better out of it.
We’re not sure whether the elegant crystal simply heightens the aesthetic
experience of wine drinking or whether there’s some more scientific reason.
The shape of the bowl also matters. Some wine glasses have very round bowls,
while others have more elongated, somewhat narrower bowls. Often, when
we’re having dinner at home, we try our wine in glasses of different shapes,
just to see which glass works best for that wine. We discuss the functions of
various glass shapes in the next section.
Tulips, flutes, trumpets, and other 
picturesque wine-glass names
You thought that a tulip was a flower and a flute was a musical instrument?
Well, they also happen to be types of glasses designed for use with sparkling
wine. The tulip is the ideally shaped glass for Champagne and other sparkling
wines (see Figure 8-4). It is tall, elongated, and narrower at the rim than in the
middle of the bowl. This shape helps hold the bubbles in the wine longer, not
allowing them to escape freely (the way the wide-mouthed, sherbet-cuplike,
so-called Champagne glasses do).

Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

The flute is another good sparkling wine glass (see Figure 8-4); but it is less
ideal than the tulip because it does not narrow at the mouth. The trumpet
actually widens at the mouth, making it less suitable for sparkling wine but
very elegant looking (see Figure 8-4). Another drawback of the trumpet glass
is that, depending on the design, the wine can actually fill the whole stem,
which means the wine warms up from the heat of your hand as you hold the
stem. We avoid the trumpet glass.
An oval-shaped bowl that is narrow at its mouth (see Figure 8-5) is ideal for
many red wines, such as Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignons, Merlots, Chiantis,
and Zinfandels. On the other hand, some red wines, such as Burgundies,
Pinot Noirs, and Barolos, are best appreciated in wider-bowled, apple-shaped
glasses (see Figure 8-5). Which shape and size works best for which wine has
to do with issues such as how the glass’s shape controls the flow of wine
onto your tongue. One glassmaker, Riedel Crystal, has designed a specific
glass for every imaginable type of wine!

Half empty or half full?
“Fill ’er up” may be the rule for your gas tank, but
not for your wine glass. We are annoyed when
servers fill our glasses to the top. We guess they
don’t want to bother re-pouring the wine too
often. Or maybe they want to give us our
money’s worth. But how can we stick our noses
into full glasses without looking like idiots? 
To leave some margin of safety for swirling and
smelling the wine, fill the glass only partially.
One-third capacity is the best fill-level for seri-
ous red wines. (This goes back to that idea of
aerating the wine.) White wine glasses can be
filled halfway, while sparkling wine glasses can
be three-quarters full.

How many glasses do I need, anyway?
So what’s a wine lover to do: Buy a different type of glass for each kind of
wine? Fortunately, some all-purpose red and white wine glasses combine the
best features, in terms of size, thickness, and shape, of most glasses. And you
don’t have to pay a fortune. Decent everyday wine glasses are available for as
little as $3 a glass in wine shops and home furnishing stores.
If you want something finer, try Riedel or Spiegelau Crystal. Riedel is an
Austrian glass manufacturer that specializes in making the right wine glass
for each kind of wine. (Spiegelau, a German company now owned by Riedel,
operates similarly, but its glasses are less expensive than Riedel’s.) A new
company, Ravenscroft Crystal, based in New York City, now also offers quality
crystal wine glasses at moderate prices. You can buy these glasses in many
department stores, specialty shops, or glass companies.
The more you care to pay attention to the flavor of the wine, the more you
truly appreciate and enjoy wine from a good wine glass. If you just don’t have
an ear for music, that’s okay, too.
Washing your wine glasses
Detergents often leave a filmy residue in glasses, which can affect the aroma
and flavor of your wine. We strongly advise that you clean your good crystal
glasses by hand, using washing soda or baking soda. (Washing soda is the
better of the two; it doesn’t cake up like baking soda.) Neither product leaves
any soapy, filmy residue in your glass. You can find washing soda in the soap/
detergent section of supermarkets.
Not Too Warm, Not Too Cold
Just as the right glass enhances your wine experience, serving wine at the
ideal temperature is a vital factor in your enjoyment of wine. Frequently, we
have tasted the same wine at different temperatures (and, believe it or not, at
different barometric pressures) and have loved the wine on one occasion but
disliked it the other time!
Most red wines are best at cool room temperature, 62° to 65°F (16° to 18°C).
Once upon a time, in drafty old English and Scottish castles, that was simply
room temperature. (Actually, it was probably warm, high noon room tempera-
ture!) Today when you hear room temperature, you think of a room that’s
about 70°F (21°C), don’t you? Red wine served at this temperature can taste
flat, flabby, lifeless, and often too hot — you get a burning sensation from the
alcohol.
119
Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

Ten or fifteen minutes in the fridge will do wonders to revive red wines that
have been suffering from heat prostration. But don’t let the wine get too cold.
Red wines served too cold taste overly tannic and acidic, decidedly unpleasant.
Light, fruity red wines, such as the most simple Beaujolais wines, are most
delightful when served slightly chilled at about 58° to 60°F (14° to 15.5°C).
Are you wondering how to know when your bottle is 58° to 60°F? You can buy
a nifty digital thermometer that wraps around the outside of the bottle and
gives you a color-coded reading. Or you can buy something that looks like
a real thermometer that you place into the opened bottle (in the bottle’s
mouth, you might say). We have both of those, and we never use them. Just
feel the bottle with your hand and take a guess. Practice makes perfect.
Just as many red wines are served too warm, most white wines are definitely
served too cold, judging by the service that we have received in many restau-
rants. The higher the quality of a white wine, the less cold it should be, so that
you can properly appreciate its flavor. Table 8-1 indicates our recommended

To avoid the problem of warm bubbly, keep an ice bucket handy. Or put the
bottle back in the refrigerator between pourings.
Keeping Leftover Wine
A sparkling-wine stopper, a device that fits over an opened bottle, is really
effective in keeping any remaining Champagne or sparkling wine fresh (often
for several days) in the refrigerator. But what do you do when you have red
or white wine left in the bottle?
You can put the cork back in the bottle if it still fits, and put the bottle into
the refrigerator. (Even red wines will stay fresher there; just take the bottle
out to warm up about an hour before serving it.) But four other methods
are also reliable in keeping your remaining wine from oxidizing; these tech-
niques are all the more effective if you put the bottle in the fridge after
using them:
 If you have about half a bottle of wine left, simply pour the wine into
a clean, empty half-sized wine bottle and recork the smaller bottle.
We sometimes buy wines in half-bottles, just to make sure that we have
the empty half-bottles around.
 Use a handy, inexpensive, miniature pump called a Vac-U-Vin in most
wine stores. This pump removes oxygen from the bottle, and the rubber
stoppers that come with it prevent additional oxygen from entering the
bottle. It’s supposed to keep your wine fresh for up to a week, but it
doesn’t always work that well, in our experience.
 Buy small cans of inert gas in some wine stores. Just squirt a few shots
of the gas into the bottle through a skinny straw, which comes with the
can, and put the cork back in the bottle. The gas displaces the oxygen in
the bottle, thus protecting the wine from oxidizing. Simple and effective.
Private Preserve is a good brand, and highly recommended.
 A new device, called WineSavor, is a flexible plastic disk that you roll up
and insert down the bottle’s neck. Once inside the bottle, the disk opens
up and floats on top of the wine, blocking the wine from oxygen.
To avoid all this bother, just drink the wine! Or, if you’re not too fussy, just place
the leftover wine in the refrigerator and drink it in the next day or two —
before it goes into a coma.

Chapter 8: The Insider’s Track to Serving and Using Wine

Entertaining with Wine
When you’re hosting a dinner party, you probably serve more wines than
you would in the course of a normal dinner. Instead of just one wine all
through the meal, you may want to serve a different wine with every course.
Many people serve two wines at the table: a white with the first course and a
red with the entrée. (And if they love wine, they use a cheese course as an
excuse to serve a second, knockout red.)
Because you want every wine to taste even better than the one before it —
besides blending perfectly with the food you’re serving — you should give
some thought to the sequence in which the wines will be served. The classic
guidelines are the following:
 White wine before red wine
 Light wine before heavy wine
 Dry wine before sweet wine
 Simple wine before complex, richly flavored wine
Each of these principles operates independently. You needn’t go crazy trying
to follow all of them together, or you’ll be able to drink nothing but light, dry,
simple whites and heavy, complex, sweet reds! A very light red wine served
before a rich, full-bodied white can work just fine. If the food you’re serving
calls for white wine, there’s really no reason that both wines couldn’t be white:
a simpler, lighter white first and a richer, fuller-bodied white second. Likewise,
both wines could be red, or you could serve a dry rosé followed by a red.

Part II: Wine and You: Up Close and Personal 
An aside about atmospheric pressure
File this under FYI (“For Your Information”) — or
maybe under “Believe It or Not.”
Several years ago, we were enjoying one of our
favorite red wines, an Italian Barbera, in the Alps.
It was a perfect summer day in the mountains —
crisp, clear, and cool. The wine was also 
perfect — absolutely delicious with our salami,
bread, and cheese. A couple of days later, we had
the very same wine at the seashore, on a cloudy,
humid, heavy-pressure day. The wine was heavy,
flat, and lifeless. What had happened to our won-
derful mountain wine? We made inquiries among
some of our wine-drinking friends and discov-
ered that they had had similar experiences. For
red wines, at least, atmospheric pressure appar-
ently influences the taste of the wine: thin, light
pressure, for the better; heavy pressure, heavy
humidity, for the worse. So the next time one of
your favorite red wines doesn’t seem quite right,
check the barometer! Believe it or not.

First things first
Even if you don’t plan to serve hors d’oeuvres, you probably want to offer
your guests a drink when they arrive to set a relaxing tone for the evening.
We like to serve Champagne (notice the capital C) as the apéritif because
opening the bottle of Champagne is a ceremony that brings together every-
one in the group. Champagne honors your guests. And a glass of Champagne
is compelling enough that to spend a thoughtful moment tasting it doesn’t
seem rude; even people who think it’s absurd to talk about wine understand
that Champagne is too special to be ignored. Also, Champagne is complex
enough that it stands alone just fine, without food.
How much is enough
The necessary quantity of each wine depends on all sorts of issues, including
the number of wines you serve (the more wines, the less you need of each),
the pace of service (if you plan a long, leisurely meal, you need more of each
wine), and the size of your wine glasses. If you’re using oversized glasses, you
need more of each wine, because it’s easy to pour more than you realize into
each glass.
Assuming a full-blown dinner that includes an apéritif wine, two wines with
dinner, and another with cheese — and guests who all drink moderately —
we recommend that you plan to have one bottle of each wine for every four
people. That gives each person four ounces of each wine, with plenty left
over in the 25-ounce bottle for refills. When serving two wines, plan one
bottle of each wine per couple.
One simpler rule is to figure, in total, a full bottle of wine per guest (total con-
sumption). That quantity may sound high, but if your dinner is spread over
several hours and you’re serving a lot of food, it really isn’t immoderate.
If you’re concerned that your guests may overindulge, be sure that their
water glasses are always full so that they have an alternative to automatically
reaching for the wine.
If your dinner party is special enough to have several food courses and sev-
eral wines, we recommend giving each guest a separate glass for each wine.
The glasses can be different for each wine, or they can be alike. All those
glasses really look festive on the table. And with a separate glass for each
wine, no guest feels compelled to empty each glass before going on to the
next wine. (You also can tell at a glance who is drinking the wine and who
isn’t really interested in it, and you can adjust your pouring accordingly.)

e’re flattered if you’ve gotten to this point by reading
every word we’ve written so far. But we realize that
you might have landed here by skipping a lot of stuff earlier
in the book. That’s okay with us — the meat and potatoes
of the book start right here.
The three chapters in this part are chock-full of information
about the world’s original wine regions — those of France,
Italy, Spain, and other European countries. We explain
what the classic grape varieties are for each region and
describe the wines, as well as name some top brands.

rance. What comes to mind when you hear that word? Strolling along
Paris’s grand boulevard, the Champs Elysées? Romance? Sky blue water
and golden sun on the French Riviera?
When we think of France, we think of wine. Bordeaux, Burgundy, Beaujolais,
Chablis, Champagne, and Sauternes are not only famous wines, they’re also
places in France where people live, work, eat, and drink wine. France still has
one of the highest per capita wine consumption rates of any major country in
the world. The French have set the standard for the rest of us.
The French Model
Why did France become the most famous place in the world for wine? For one
thing, the French have been doing it for a long time — making wine, that is.
Even before the Romans conquered Gaul and planted vineyards, the Greeks
arrived with their vines.
Equally important is French terroir, the magical combination of climate and
soil that, when it clicks, can yield grapes that make breathtaking wines. And
what grapes! France is the home of almost all the renowned varieties in the
world — Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah, and
Sauvignon Blanc, just to name a few. (See Chapter 3 for more information on
these grape varieties.)

France is the model, the standard setter, for the world’s wines: Most wine-
producing countries now make their own versions of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and so on, thanks to the success of these
grapes in France.
Understanding French wine law
France’s system of defining and regulating wine regions — the Appellation
d’Origine Contrôlée, or AOC (translated as regulated place name or regulated
origin name) system, established in 1935 — has been the legislative model for
most other European countries. The European Union’s (EU’s) framework of
wine laws, within which the AOC system now operates, is also modeled on
the French system.
To understand French wines and wine laws, you need to know four things:
 Most French wines are named after places. (These aren’t arbitrary places;
they’re places registered and defined in French wine regulations.) When
we talk about French wines and the regions they come from, most of the
time the wine and the region have the same name (as in Burgundy, from
Burgundy).
 The French wine system is hierarchical. Some wines (that is, the wines
of some places) officially have higher rank than other wines.
 Generally, the smaller and more specific the place for which a wine is
named, the higher its rank.
 Just because a wine carries a high rank doesn’t necessarily mean that
it’s better than the next wine; it just means that it should be better. The
laws rank the potential of the place where the wine comes from, and are
not infallible indications of a wine’s actual quality.
There are four possible ranks of French wine, according to French wine law.
You can determine the rank of a French wine at a glance by seeing which of
the following French phrases appears on the label. (Wines of higher rank gen-
erally cost more.) From highest to lowest, the rankings are
 Appellation Contrôlée, or AOC (or AC), the highest grade. On the label,
the place-name of the wine usually appears between the two French
words, as in Appellation Bordeaux Contrôlée.
 Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure, or VDQS wine (translated as de-
marcated wine of superior quality). These words appear on the label
immediately below the name of the wine. This is a small category.
 Vin de pays, meaning country wine. On the label, the phrase is always fol-
lowed by a place-name, such as Vin de Pays de l’Hérault, which indicates
the area where the grapes grew; the places or regions are generally much
larger than the places or regions referred to in the two higher rankings.
128
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

 Vin de table, ordinary French table wine that carries no geographic indi-
cation other than “France.” By law, these wines may not indicate a grape
variety or vintage. (See Chapter 4 for more about table wines.)
Here’s how these four categories of French wines fit within the European
Union’s two-tier system described in Chapter 4:
 All AOC and VDQS wines fall into the EU’s higher tier, QWPSR (Quality
Wine Produced in a Specific Region, or simply quality wine).
 All vins de pays and vins de table fall into the EU’s lower tier, table wines.
Fine distinctions in the ranks
France’s system of place-naming its wines is actually a bit more complex
than the four neat categories described in the preceding section may imply.
Although all AOC wines/places hold exactly the same legal status — they’re
all generals in the French wine army, let’s say — the market accords some
AOCs higher regard (and higher prices) than others, based on the specificity
of their terroir.
Some large AOC territories have smaller AOC zones nestled within them.
When territories overlap, any wines produced from grapes grown within the
larger area, such as Bordeaux, may carry that AOC place-name (assuming that
the proper grape varieties are used and the wine conforms to the regulations
for Bordeaux in all other respects). But wines whose grapes come from smaller
territories within the larger area can be entitled to different, more specific
AOC names, such as a district name, Haut-Médoc. That district can encom-
pass even smaller AOC zones; wines made from grapes grown in these more
limited zones may use yet another AOC name, such as Pauillac, a village.
(They’re all generals, but some of them have silver stars.)
The more specific the place described in the wine name, the finer the wine is
generally considered to be in the eyes of the market, and the higher the price
the winemaker can ask. Naturally, a winemaker will use the most specific
name to which his wine is entitled.
In increasing order of specificity, an AOC name can be the name of
 A region (Bordeaux or Burgundy, for example)
 A district (Haut-Médoc or Côte de Beaune)
 A subdistrict (Côte de Beaune-Villages)
 A village or commune (Pauillac or Meursault)
 A specific vineyard (Le Montrachet)
129
Chapter 9: Doing France

Unfortunately, unless you’re an expert at French geography and place-names,
you won’t know which type of place an AOC name refers to just by looking at
the label.
France’s Wine Regions
France has five wine regions that are extremely important for the quality and
renown of the wines they produce, and it has several other regions that make
interesting wines worth knowing about. The three major regions for red wine
are Bordeaux, Burgundy, and the Rhône; for white wines, Burgundy is again a
major region, along with the Loire and Alsace. Each region specializes in cer-
tain grape varieties for its wines, based on climate, soil, and local tradition.
Table 9-1 provides a quick reference to the grapes and wines of these five
regions. Later sections of this chapter describe the regions and their wines.

Two other significant French wine regions are Provence and Languedoc-

France, such as Cahors, produce good-value wines and in some cases, seri-
ously good wines.
We cover all these regions in this chapter, in more or less detail according to
the importance of the region. For more specific information on French wines,
see our book French Wine For Dummies (Wiley).
Bordeaux: The Incomparable
To really know wine, you must know French wine — French wines are that
important in the wine world. Likewise, you must know Bordeaux to know
French wine. Bordeaux is a wine region in western France named after the
fourth-largest French city (see Figure 9-1). It produces 26 percent of all AOC
wine. About 83 percent of Bordeaux wines are dry reds; 15 percent of the
region’s production is dry white, and 2 percent is sweet white wine, such as
Sauternes.
Because the Bordeaux region is situated on the Atlantic coast, it has a mari-
time climate, with warm summers and fairly mild winters. The maritime
weather brings rain, often during harvest time. The weather varies from year
to year, and the character and quality of the vintages therefore also vary;
when all goes well, such as in 1996, 2000, and 2005, the wines can be great.

Bordeaux’s reputation as one of the greatest wine regions in the world
revolves around the legendary red wines of Bordeaux — grands vins (great
wines) made by historic chateaux (wine estates) and capable of improving for
many decades (see Chapter 16). Prices for these wines run to well over $500
a bottle for Château Pétrus — one of the most expensive red Bordeaux wines.
(Old vintages of Pétrus cost even more!)

Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
The taste of really great Bordeaux
When young, the finest red Bordeaux wines
have a deep ruby hue and aromas of blackcur-
rants, plums, spice, cedar, and cassis. For the
first ten years or so, these wines can be very dry
in texture, almost austere, with tannin masking
the fruity flavors. Eventually, the wines turn
garnet, develop an extraordinarily complex bou-
quet and flavor, and soften in tannin. The very
finest red Bordeaux wines will frequently take
20 years or more before reaching their maturity;
some have lasted well over 100 years (see
Chapter 16).

These legendary wines represent the pinnacle of a red Bordeaux pyramid;
quantitatively, they’re only a very small part of the region’s red wine pro-
duction, which also includes medium-priced and even inexpensive wines.
Middle-level Bordeaux reds are ready to drink within 10 to 15 years of the
harvest. Most fine Bordeaux wines, both red and white, start at about $25
a bottle when they’re first available, two or three years after the vintage.
The least expensive Bordeaux reds, which can cost as little as $8 a bottle,
are enjoyable young, within two to five years of the vintage date.
The subregions of red Bordeaux
Two distinct red wine production zones exist within the Bordeaux region;
these two areas have come to be called the Left Bank and the Right Bank —
just as in Paris. While many of the least expensive Bordeaux reds are blended
from grapes grown all through the Bordeaux region — and thus carry the
region-wide AOC designation, Bordeaux — the better wines come from spe-
cific AOC districts or AOC communes that are located in either the Right Bank
or the Left Bank.
The Left Bank vineyards lie west of the Garonne River (the more southerly of
the two rivers depicted in the Bordeaux inset of Figure 9-1) and the Gironde
Estuary into which the Garonne empties. The Right Bank vineyards lie east
and north of the Dordogne River (the more northerly of the two rivers depicted
in the inset), and east of the Gironde Estuary. (The middle ground in between
the two rivers is more important for white wine than for red.)
Of the various wine districts on the Left Bank and the Right Bank, four (two
on each bank) are the most important:
 Left Bank (the western area): Haut-Médoc, Pessac-Léognan
 Right Bank (the eastern area): St-Emilion, Pomerol
The Left Bank and the Right Bank differ mainly in soil composition: Gravel
predominates on the Left Bank, and clay prevails on the Right Bank. As a
result, Cabernet Sauvignon, which has an affinity for gravel, is the principal
grape variety in the Haut-Médoc (oh meh doc) and Pessac-Léognan (pay sac
lay oh nyahn). Merlot, which does well in clay, dominates the St-Emilion
(sant em eel yon) and Pomerol (pohm eh roll) wines. (Both areas grow
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, as well as Cabernet Franc and two less 
significant grapes. See Chapter 3 for more information on grape varieties.)
Left Bank and Right Bank Bordeaux wines are therefore markedly different
from one another. But wines from the Haut-Médoc and Pessac-Léognan are
quite similar; likewise, it can be difficult to tell the difference among wines
from Pomerol and St-Emilion (on the Right Bank).
133
Chapter 9: Doing France

Each bank — in fact, each of the four districts — has its avid fans. The more
established Left Bank generally produces austere, tannic wines with more
pronounced blackcurrant flavor. Left Bank wines usually need many years to
develop and will age for a long time, often for decades — typical of a Cabernet
Sauvignon-based wine.
Bordeaux wines from the Right Bank are better introductory wines for the
novice Bordeaux drinker. Because they’re mainly Merlot, they’re more
approachable; you can enjoy them long before their Left Bank cousins, often
as soon as five to eight years after the vintage. They’re less tannic, richer in
texture, and plummier in flavor, and they generally contain a bit more alcohol
than Left Bank reds.
The Médoc mosaic
Historically, the Haut-Médoc has always been Bordeaux’s most important dis-
trict, and it deserves special attention. The Haut-Médoc is actually part of the
Médoc peninsula. The name Médoc has two meanings. It refers to the entire
area west of the wide Gironde Estuary (see Figure 9-1), and it’s also the name
for the northernmost district of the Left Bank. In other words (in the same
word, actually), Médoc is frequently used as an umbrella term for the com-
bined districts of Médoc and Haut-Médoc (the two districts that occupy the
Médoc peninsula).
Of the two districts, the Haut-Médoc, in the south, is by far the more important
for wine. The Haut-Médoc itself encompasses four famous wine communes:
St. Estèphe (sant eh steff), Pauillac (poy yac), St-Julien (san jhoo lee ehn), and
Margaux (mahr go). Table 9-2 gives a general description of each commune’s
wines.

134
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Two other communes in the Haut-Médoc — Listrac (lee strahk) and Moulis
(moo lees) — make less well-known wines. Vineyards in the Haut-Médoc that
aren’t located in the vicinity of these six communes carry the district-wide
appellation, Haut-Médoc, rather than that of a specific commune.
The names of these districts and communes are part of the official name of
wines made there, and appear on the label.
Classified information
Have you ever wondered what a wine expert was talking about when he
smugly pronounced a particular Bordeaux second growth? Wonder no more.
He’s talking about a chateau (as wine estates are called in Bordeaux) that
made the grade about 150 years ago.
Back in 1855, when an Exposition (akin to a World’s Fair) took place in Paris,
the organizers asked the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce to develop a clas-
sification of Bordeaux wines. The Chamber of Commerce delegated the task
to the Bordeaux wine brokers, the people who buy and re-sell the wines of
Bordeaux. These merchants named 61 top red wines — 60 from the Médoc
and one from what was then called Graves (and today is known as Péssac-
Leognan). According to the prices fetched by the wines at the time and the
existing reputations of the wines, they divided these 61 wines into five cate-
gories, known as crus or growths. (In Bordeaux, a cru refers to a wine estate.)
Their listing is known as the classification of 1855; to this day, these classified
growths enjoy special prestige among wine lovers. (The Bordeaux wine brokers
also classified Sauternes, the great Bordelais dessert wine; see Chapter 15 for
info on Sauternes). The following list shows the five categories and names the
first growths:
 First Growths (5 chateaux)
Château Lafite-Rothschild
Château Latour
Château Margaux
Château Haut-Brion
Château Mouton-Rothschild (elevated from a Second Growth in 1973)
 Second Growths (14 chateaux)
 Third Growths (14 chateaux)
 Fourth Growths (10 chateaux)
 Fifth Growths (18 chateaux)
The 61 ranked wine estates are sometimes referred to as Great Growths or
Grands Crus Classés. To appreciate the honor attached to being one of the
Great Growths, bear in mind that there are about 8,000 chateaux (and over
13,000 wine producers) in Bordeaux!
135
Chapter 9: Doing France

The 1855 classification has held up remarkably well over time. Sure, a few
of the 61 properties are not performing up to their classification today,
while other unclassified chateaux now probably deserve to be included.
But because of the politics involved, no changes in classification ranking
have been made, with one dramatic exception (see “The Mouton exception”
sidebar). Appendix B in our book French Wine For Dummies has a complete
listing of the 61 wines in the 1855 classification.
Just to confuse things even more: Although the 1855 classification completely
ignored the wines of St-Emilion, the AOC commission classified those wines a
century later, in 1955. The wines fall into three quality categories, which are
indicated on the labels:
 Currently, 13 chateaux have the highest ranking, Premier Grand Cru
Classé. Two of the 13, Château Ausone and Château Cheval Blanc, are
on their own pedestal as “Category A”; the other 11 are “Category B”
Premier Grand Cru Classé wines.
 A middle category, Grand Cru Classé, consists of 55 chateaux.
 The third category, simply “Grand Cru,” encompasses some 200 properties.
The wines of Pessac-Léognan were classified in 1953, and again in 1959. The
wines of Pomerol have never been officially classified. (For more info on 
St-Emilion’s and Pessac-Léognan’s classified Bordeaux, see Chapter 4 of

in the 1855 classification” rule occurred in 1973.
That year, the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild,
finally (and rightfully) triumphed in his 50-year
battle with the French government to have his
beloved Château Mouton-Rothschild upgraded
from a second growth to a first growth. The
Minister of Agriculture (at that time, Jacques
Chirac!) decreed that Château Mouton-Rothschild
was indeed a first growth — which Bordeaux
wine lovers considered it to be all along, in qual-
ity if not in official status. The Baron’s motto,
written in French on his family crest, had to
change. Before 1973, it read
First, I cannot be; second, I do not deign to
be; Mouton, I am.
The Baron changed the motto on his 1973
Château Mouton-Rothschild to read
First, I am; second, I was; Mouton does not
change.
A postscript to this wonderful story: We adopted
an adorable little kitten, a Blue Point Siamese,
in 1973. Since Mouton-Rothschild is one of our
favorite wines, and since our little kitten demon-
strated the same firm, tenacious qualities as the
wine, we named him Mouton. He was with us
for 20 years, proving that he had the same
longevity as the wine for which he was named.
He is buried in our backyard, in an old wooden
crate that once held 1973 Mouton-Rothschild.

Chapter 9: Doing France

The value end of the Bordeaux spectrum
As you may have suspected, the best buys in Bordeaux wines are not the
illustrious classified growths. For really good values (and wines that you can
drink within a few years of the vintage), look for Bordeaux wines that were
not included in the 1855 classification.
Cru Bourgeois: The Middle Class of the Médoc
In 1932, a group of producers in the Médoc whose wines weren’t recognized
as Grands Crus Classés in the 1855 Bordeaux Classification obtained their own
legally recognized classification, Cru Bourgeois. The wines in this category
are considered just a bit less noble than the Grands Crus Classé wines, but sell
at considerably lower prices, mainly in the $18 to $35 range; some of them
are even as good as the lesser-quality classified growths.
In 2005, the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce reclassified the Cru Bourgeois
wines; 490 chateaux applied for classification, but only 247 made the grade.
The jury divided the wineries into three categories: nine chateaux are now
in the highest level, Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel; 87 have Cru Bourgeois
Superieurs status, and 151 chateaux are standard Cru Bourgeois wines.
(Many of those whose chateaux were excluded brought the issue to court
and their declassification was voided, but it is still unclear whether they may
call their properties cru bourgeois or not.) The nine Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel
wines are the following:
Château Chasse-Spleen
Château Phélan-Ségur
Château Poujeaux
Château Les Ormes-de-Pez
Château Haut-Marbuzet
Château de Pez
Château Labegorce-Zédé
Château Potensac
Château Siran
Château Gloria, from St.-Julien, a wine often compared to Grands Crus Classé
wines in quality, refused to apply for membership as a Cru Bourgeois wine,
but critics generally agree that it would have been awarded Cru Bourgeois
Exceptionnel status had it done so. In addition to the above wines, we recom-
mend the following Cru Bourgeois wines:
Château Monbrison
Château Meyney
Château d’Angludet
Château Sociando Mallet
Château Coufran
Château Lanessan
Château Haut-Beauséjour
Château Loudenne
Château Fourcas-Hosten
Château Monbousquet
Château Bel Air
Château Greysac
January 2006 saw the revival of another category, Cru Artisans du Médoc,
which was first formed in the 19th century. The Cru Artisan chateaux are a
step below Cru Bourgeois wines; 44 chateaux in the Médoc have Cru Artisan
status, and can place this designation on their labels beginning with the 2005
vintage. Prices for Cru Artisan Bordeaux are about $9 to $18.

Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac
When you leave the Médoc peninsula and the city of Bordeaux and cross
over the Dordogne River into the Right Bank region, the first wine districts
you encounter on your left are Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac. Of the lesser
Bordeaux appellations, Canon-Fronsac and Fronsac have the highest reputa-
tions for quality, and they’re priced accordingly, in the $20 to $30 range. Like
St.-Emilion and Pomerol, Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac produce only red wines,
and Merlot is the dominant grape variety. (For a list of the better wines from
these districts, see Chapter 5 in French Wine For Dummies.)
Petits Chateaux
Petits chateaux is the general, catch-all term for the huge category of reason-
ably priced wines throughout the entire Bordeaux region that have never
been classified. The term is somewhat of a misnomer because it suggests
that the wines come from a specific chateau or vineyard estate; in fact, many
petits chateaux do come from specific estates, but not all.
Some of these wines use grapes that have been sourced from all over the
region, and others come from specific appellations. Ten petit chateau red
appellations, all on the Right Bank, are noteworthy:
Côtes de Bourg
Puisseguin-St.-Emilion
Premières Côtes de Blaye
Lussac-St.-Emilion
Côtes de Castillon
Montagne-St.-Emilion
Côtes de Francs
St.-Georges-St.-Emilion
Lalande de Pomerol
Premières Côtes de Bordeaux
Lalande de Pomerol is a satellite district of Pomerol, and the four districts
with “St.-Emilion” appended to their names surround St.-Emilion. The Côtes
de Bourg and Premières Côtes de Blaye take their names from the port towns
of Bourg and Blaye, on the Right Bank of the Gironde Estuary, opposite the
Haut-Médoc. (A movement is afoot in Bordeaux to combine the five AOCs
mentioned above that have the word “Côtes” in their name into a single, new
appellation called Côtes de Bordeaux.)
We especially recommend wines from the Côtes de Bourg, Premières Côtes de
Blaye, and Lalande de Pomerol as particularly good values. The wines from
all ten appellations are mainly in the $12 to $22 range. 
All these wines are primarily Merlot. They are generally fruitier, have softer
tannins and are readier to drink sooner than the Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated
wines of the Left Bank. In our recently published book, Wine Style (Wiley),
we describe these wines as “Mild-mannered Reds.” Petits chateaux are the
Bordeaux wines of choice when you’re looking for a young, inexpensive,
approachable Bordeaux with dinner. (For a listing of recommended petit
chateaux red Bordeaux wines, see Chapters 5 in French Wine For Dummies.)
139
Chapter 9: Doing France

Generic Bordeaux
Red Bordeaux wines with no specific appellation carry the general “Bordeaux”
or “Bordeaux Supérieur” appellations. Their grapes are predominantly Merlot
and can grow anywhere throughout the Bordeaux region. These are fairly
light-bodied wines (“Mild-mannered reds”) that sell for $8 to $12. Sometimes
the labels identify the wines as specifically Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon.
Two leading brands are Mouton-Cadet and Michel Lynch. Generic Bordeaux
from good vintages, such as 2000 and 2005, can be really excellent buys.
Practical advice on drinking red Bordeaux
Because the finest red Bordeaux wines take many years to develop, they’re
often not good choices in restaurants, where the vintages available tend to be
fairly recent. And when mature Bordeaux wines are available in restaurants,
they’re usually extremely expensive. Order a lesser Bordeaux when you’re
dining out, and save the best ones for drinking at home.
Red Bordeaux wines go well with lamb, venison, simple roasts, and hard
cheeses, such as Comte, Gruyère, or Cheddar. If you plan to serve a fine red
Bordeaux from a good but recent vintage (see Appendix C), you should
decant it at least an hour before dinner and let it aerate (see Chapter 8);
serve it at about 62° to 66°F (17° to 19°C). Better yet, if you have good storage
conditions (see Chapter 16), save your young Bordeaux for a few years — it
will only get better.
Fine recent Bordeaux vintages are 2005 (which shows promise of being truly
great), 2000, 1996, 1995, 1990, 1989, 1986, and 1982. (Most 2005 Bordeaux will
be available beginning in the fall of 2007 and in 2008.)
140
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Reverse chic: Drinking inexpensive Bordeaux
Some wine snobs wouldn’t think of ordering
anything but Classified Growth Bordeaux in
restaurants. But if you’re just getting acquainted
with these wines, starting with an expensive,
top-rated Bordeaux doesn’t make any sense.
Begin with inexpensive, easier-drinking Bordeaux
wines first, so that you can develop a context for
evaluating and appreciating the finer Bordeaux.
The contrast of simpler Bordeaux really helps
you understand the majesty of the great
Bordeaux wines. Besides, every dinner doesn’t
call for a great Bordeaux. A modest Bordeaux
is perfectly suitable for simpler fare, such as
stew or a burger.

Bordeaux also comes in white
White Bordeaux wine comes in two styles, dry and sweet. The dry wines
themselves are really in two different categories: inexpensive wines for enjoy-
ing young, and wines so distinguished and age-worthy that they rank among
the great dry white wines of the world.
Two areas of the Bordeaux region are important for white wine production:
 The large district south of the city of Bordeaux is known as the Graves
(grahv; see the Bordeaux inset in Figure 9-1). The Graves district and the
Pessac-Léognan district, directly north (around the city of Bordeaux)
are home to the finest white wines of Bordeaux, both dry and sweet.
(We cover the great dessert wine from the southern Graves, Sauternes,
in Chapter 15.)
 In the middle ground between the Garonne and Dordogne Rivers, 
east of Graves and Pessac-Léognan, a district called Entre-Deux-Mers
(ahn treh-douh-mare) is also known for its dry, semi-dry, and sweet white
Bordeaux wines.
A few white wines also come from the predominantly red-wine Haut-Médoc
district, such as the superb Pavillon Blanc du Château Margaux. Although
special and expensive, they qualify only for simple Bordeaux blanc appellation.
Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, in various combinations, are the two main grape
varieties for the top white Bordeaux. It’s a fortunate blend: The Sauvignon Blanc
component offers immediate charm in the wine, while the slower-developing
Sémillon gives the wine a viscous quality and depth, enabling it to age well.
In general, a high percentage of Sémillon in the wine is a good indicator of the
wine’s ageworthiness. Many inexpensive white Bordeaux — and a few of the
best wines — are entirely Sauvignon Blanc.
The top dry white Bordeaux wines are crisp and lively when they’re young,
but they develop richness, complexity, and a honeyed bouquet with age.
In good vintages (see Appendix C), the best whites need at least ten years to
develop and can live many years more. (See Chapter 16 for more information
on older Bordeaux.)
Table 9-3 lists the top 12 white wines of Pessac-Léognan and Graves, in our
rough order of preference, and shows their grape blends. We separated the
wines into an A and B group because the four wines in the first group literally
are in a class by themselves, quality-wise; they possess not only more depth
and complexity but also more longevity than other white Bordeaux. Their prices
reflect that fact — the A group wines range from $80 to $300 per bottle, whereas
the B group wines cost between $30 and $70. (For more info about white
Bordeaux, see Chapter 6 in French Wine For Dummies.)

Burgundy: The Other Great French Wine
Burgundy, a wine region in eastern France, southeast of Paris (refer to
Figure 9-1), stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Bordeaux as one of France’s
two greatest regions for dry, non-sparkling wines.
Unlike Bordeaux, Burgundy’s fame is split nearly equally between its white and
red wines. Also unlike Bordeaux, good Burgundy is often scarce. The reason
is simple: Not counting Beaujolais (which is technically Burgundy, but really a
separate type of wine), Burgundy produces only 25 percent as much wine as
Bordeaux.
Burgundy’s vineyards are more fragmented than Bordeaux’s. The soils of the
Burgundy region vary from hillside to hillside and even from the middle of
each hill to the bottom. You can find two different vineyards growing the
same grape but making distinctly different wines only two meters apart from
each other across a dirt road!
142
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Burgundy (or, as the French call it, Bourgogne, pronounced bor guh nyeh) is
also a region of much smaller vineyard holdings than Bordeaux. The French
Revolution in 1789 is partly to blame. French nobility and the Catholic Church
were once the major vineyard owners, but after the Revolution, their lands
were distributed to the populace. (Bordeaux, once owned by the English, and
more distant from Paris, was considered somehow less French and wasn’t
really that affected by the Revolution.) France’s Napoleonic Code, which
requires all land to be equally divided among one’s heirs, over time further
fragmented each family’s property in Burgundy.
The few large vineyards that do exist in Burgundy have multiple owners, with
some families owning only two or three rows of vines in a particular vineyard.
(One famous Burgundy vineyard, Clos de Vougeot, has about 82 owners!) The
typical Burgundy winemaker’s production varies from 50 cases to 1,000 cases
of wine a year, per type — far from enough to satisfy wine lovers all over the
world. Compare that to Bordeaux, where the average chateau owner makes
15,000 to 20,000 cases of his principal wine annually.
In Burgundy, the winemaker calls his property a domaine, certainly a more
modest name than chateau, and a proper reflection of the size of his winery.
Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Gamay
Burgundy has a continental climate (warm summers and cold winters) and is
subject to localized summer hailstorms that can damage the grapes and cause
rot. The soil is mainly limestone and clay. Burgundy’s terroir is particularly suited
to the two main grape varieties of the region, Pinot Noir (for red Burgundy) and
Chardonnay (for white Burgundy). In fact, nowhere else in the entire world does
the very fickle, difficult Pinot Noir grape perform better than in Burgundy.
In the southerly Beaujolais district of Burgundy, the soil becomes primarily
granitic but also rich in clay and sand, very suitable for the Gamay grape of
this area.
Districts, districts everywhere
Burgundy has five districts, all of which make quite distinct wines. The dis-
tricts, from north to south, are the following (to see where in Burgundy each
of these districts is situated, refer to the Burgundy inset in Figure 9-1): 
 Chablis (shah blee)
 The Côte d’Or (coat dor)
 The Côte Chalonnaise (coat shal oh naze)
 The Mâconnais (mack coh nay)
 Beaujolais (boh jhoe lay)
143
Chapter 9: Doing France

The heart of Burgundy, the Côte d’Or (which literally means golden slope),
itself has two parts: Côte de Nuits (coat deh nwee) in the north and the
Côte de Beaune (coat deh bone) in the south.
The Chablis district makes only white wines, and the Mâconnais makes
mainly white wines. Beaujolais makes almost exclusively red wines; even
though Beaujolais is part of Burgundy, Beaujolais is an entirely different wine,
because it is made with the Gamay grape rather than Pinot Noir. The same is
true of Mâcon Rouge, from the Mâconnais district; even the small amount
that’s made from Pinot Noir rather than from Gamay does not resemble more
northerly red Burgundies. (Actually, very little red Mâcon is exported; the
world sees mainly white Mâcon.)
The term red Burgundy refers primarily to the red wines of the Côte d’Or and
also to the less well-known — and less expensive — red wines of the Côte
Chalonnaise. Likewise, when wine lovers talk about white Burgundy, they
are usually referring just to the white wines of the Côte d’Or and the Côte
Chalonnaise. They’ll use the more precise names, Chablis and Mâcon, to refer
to the white wines of those parts of Burgundy. On the other hand, when wine
lovers talk about the region, Burgundy, they could very well be referring to
the whole shebang, including Beaujolais, or all of Burgundy except Beaujolais.
It’s an imprecise language.
Don’t ever mistake the inexpensive red California wine that calls itself 
burgundy — or the inexpensive California wine that calls itself chablis —
for the real McCoys from France. These imposter wines are the products of
various ordinary grapes grown in industrial-scale vineyards 6,000 miles away
from the Côte d’Or. We’d be surprised if either one had even a drop of the
true grapes of Burgundy — Pinot Noir or Chardonnay — in them.
From the regional to the sublime
Because soils vary so much in Burgundy, a wine’s specific vineyard site
becomes extremely relevant to the taste, quality, and price of that wine.
A wine made from a tiny vineyard with its own particular characteristics is
unique, more precious and rare than a wine blended from several vineyards
or a wine from a less-favored site.
The AOC structure for Burgundy wines recognizes the importance of site.
While there are region-wide AOCs, district-wide AOCs, and commune 
AOCs — just as in Bordeaux — there are also AOC names that refer to individual
vineyards. In fact, some of these vineyards are recognized as better than others:
Some of them are premier cru (prem yay crew), meaning first growth, while
the very best are grand cru, meaning great growth.
144
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Bordeaux producers use the terms premier cru and grand cru, too. In Bordeaux,
however, except for St.Emilion, the terms represent status bestowed on a
winery by a classification outside the AOC law (as when a First Growth calls
itself a Premier Grand Cru Classé on its label, based on the 1855 Classification).
In Burgundy, premier cru and grand cru are always official distinctions within
the AOC law. Their meaning is extremely precise.
Table 9-4 gives examples of AOC names in Burgundy, listed in order of
increasing specificity.

The availability and price of each category’s wines vary in the following ways:
 The two broadest categories — regional and district place-names —
account for 65 percent of all Burgundy wines. These wines retail for
$11 to $25 a bottle. (You can buy affordable Burgundies at this level.)
 Commune-specific (also referred to as village) wines, such as Pommard
or Gevrey-Chambertin, make up 23 percent of Burgundy and are in the
$25 to $55 per bottle price range. Fifty-three communes in Burgundy
have AOC status.
 Premier crus, such as Meursault Les Perrières or Nuits-St. Georges
Les Vaucrains, account for 11 percent of Burgundy wines; 561 vineyards
have premier cru status. Most of these wines cost from $35 to $90 per
bottle — but a few cost over $100 per bottle.
 The 31 grand crus, such as Chambertin, represent only 1 percent of
Burgundy’s wines. Prices for grand cru Burgundies — both red and
white — start at around $75 and can go to well over $800 a bottle for
Romanée-Conti, normally Burgundy’s most expensive red wine.
145
Chapter 9: Doing France

Thankfully, you can usually tell the difference between a premier cru and a
grand cru Burgundy by looking at the label. Premier cru wines tend to carry
the name of their commune plus the vineyard name — most often in the same-
sized lettering — on the label and, often, the words Premier Cru (or 1er Cru).
If a vineyard name is in smaller lettering than the commune name, the wine is
generally not a premier cru but a wine from a single-vineyard site in that com-
mune. (Not all single vineyards have premier cru status.) Grand cru Burgundies
carry only the name of the vineyard on the label. (For a complete listing of all
grand cru Burgundies, see Appendix B in French Wine For Dummies.)
If a wine contains grapes from two or more premier crus in the same com-
mune, it can be called a premier cru but it won’t carry the name of a specific
premier cru vineyard. The label will carry a commune name and the words
premier cru.
The Côte d’Or: The heart of Burgundy
The Côte d’Or, a narrow 40-mile stretch of land with some of the most expen-
sive real estate in the world, is the region where all the famous red and white
Burgundies originate. The northern part of the Côte d’Or is named the Côte
de Nuits, after its most important (commercial) city, Nuits-Saint-Georges.
This area makes red Burgundies almost exclusively, although one superb
white Burgundy, Musigny Blanc, and a couple other white Burgundies do
exist on the Côte de Nuits. The following wine communes, from north to
south, are in the Côte de Nuits; the names of these communes are also the
names of their wines:
146
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
The taste of fine red Burgundy
Red Burgundy is paler than Bordeaux, with a
less dense ruby or garnet color, because Pinot
Noir grapes do not have nearly as much pig-
mentation as Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot
grapes. It’s rather full-bodied in terms of its
alcohol and is relatively low in tannin. The char-
acteristic aroma is of red or black berries and
woodsy, damp-earth, or mushroomy scents.
When a red Burgundy ages, it often develops a
silky texture, richness, and a natural sweetness
of fruit flavors; sometimes a bouquet of leather,
coffee, and game emerges.
With some exceptions (for example, a powerful
wine from a great vintage, such as 2002 or 1996),
red Burgundy should be consumed within ten
years of the vintage — and even sooner in
a weaker vintage (see Appendix C for vintage
ratings).

 Marsannay (mahr sah nay): Known for lighter-bodied reds and rosés
 Fixin (fee san): Sturdy, earthy, firm red wines
 Gevrey-Chambertin (jehv ray sham ber tan): Full-bodied, rich red
wines; nine grand crus, such as Chambertin, Chambertin Clos de Bèze
 Morey-Saint Denis (maw ree san d’nee): Full, sturdy red wines; grand
crus are Bonnes Mares (part), Clos de la Roche, Clos Saint-Denis, Clos de
Tart, Clos des Lambrays
 Chambolle-Musigny (shom bowl moo sih nyee): Supple, elegant red
wines; grand crus include Musigny and Bonnes Mares (part)
 Vougeot (voo joe): Medium-bodied red wines; grand cru is Clos de
Vougeot
 Vosne-Romanée (vone roh mah nay): Elegant, rich, velvety red wines;
the six grand crus are Romanée-Conti, La Tache, Richebourg, Romanée-
Saint-Vivant, La Romanée, and La Grand Rue
 Flagey-Échézeaux (flah jhay eh sheh zoe): Hamlet of Vosne-Romanée;
grand crus are Grands-Échézeaux and Échézeaux
 Nuits-Saint-Georges (nwee san johrjes): Sturdy, earthy, red wines; no
grand crus; fine premier crus

Burgundy AOCs (Once again, with feeling)
Burgundies with regional, or region-wide, AOCs
are easy to recognize — they always start with
the word Bourgogne (boor guh nyeh). In the 
following list, read the AOC names down each
column to see how the names change, becom-
ing more specific from district to grand cru.

The southern part of the Côte d’Or, the Côte de Beaune, is named after its
most important city, Beaune (the commercial and tourist center of the Côte
d’Or). The Côte de Beaune makes both white and red Burgundies, but the
whites are more renowned. The following communes, from north to south,
make up the Côte de Beaune:
 Ladoix (lah dwah): Seldom-seen, inexpensive red and white wines; part
of the grand cru vineyards, Corton (red) and Corton-Charlemagne (white)
are in this commune
 Pernand-Vergelesses (per nahn ver jeh less): Little-known red and
white wines; good buys
 Aloxe-Corton (ah luss cortohn): Full, sturdy wines; several red grand
crus that all include the name Corton and one magnificent white grand
cru (Corton-Charlemagne) are here
 Chorey-lès-Beaune (shor ay lay bone): Mainly good-value red wine and
a little white wine
 Savigny-lès-Beaune (sah vee nyee lay bone): Mostly red wines; fine
values here, too
 Beaune (bone): Supple, medium-bodied reds; some whites; fine premier
crus here
 Pommard (pohm mahr): Sturdy, full red wines; some good premier crus
(Rugiens and Epénots)
 Volnay (vohl nay): Graceful, elegant red wines; good premier crus
(Caillerets and Clos des Ducs)
 Auxey-Duresses (awe see duh ress), Monthélie (mon tel lee), Saint-
Romain (san roh man), Saint-Aubin (sant oh ban): Four little-known
villages producing mainly red wines; excellent values
 Meursault (muhr so): The northernmost important white Burgundy
commune; full-bodied, nutty wines; some excellent premier crus
(Les Perrières and Les Genevrières)
 Puligny-Montrachet (poo lee nyee mon rah shay): Home of elegant white
Burgundies; grand crus include Montrachet (part), Chevalier-Montrachet,
148
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
The taste of fine white Burgundy
White Burgundy combines a richness of flavor —
peaches, hazelnuts, and honey in Meursault;
floweriness and butterscotch in a Puligny or
Chassagne-Montrachet — with lively acidity
and a touch of oak. With age, even more flavor
complexity develops. The wine leaves a linger-
ing reminder of all its flavors. Chardonnay wines
from other regions and countries can be good,
but there’s nothing else quite like a great white
Burgundy.

Bâtard-Montrachet (part), and Bienvenues-Bâtard Montrachet, plus very
fine premier crus
 Chassagne-Montrachet (shah sahn nyah mon rah shay): A bit sturdier
than Puligny; the rest of the Montrachet and Bâtard-Montrachet grand
crus are situated here, along with Criots-Bâtard Montrachet grand cru;
also, some earthy, rustic reds
 Santenay (sant nay): Light-bodied, inexpensive red wines here
 Maranges (ma rahnj): Little-known, mainly red, inexpensive wines
All these red wines are entirely Pinot Noir, and the whites are entirely
Chardonnay. The different characteristics from one wine to the next are due
to the wines’ individual terroirs.

Practical advice on buying Burgundy
Nice of the Burgundians to make everything so
stratified and clear, isn’t it? Premier cru
Burgundies are always better than commune
wines, and grand crus are the best of all, right?
Well, it ain’t necessarily so! In order of impor-
tance, these are the criteria to follow when
you’re buying Burgundy:
 The producer’s reputation: Based on wines
he has made in recent years
 The vintage year: Quality fluctuates greatly
from year to year
 The appellation: The name of the commune
or vineyard and its specificity
The producer and the vintage are considerably
more important than the appellation in
Burgundy. Good vintages for red Burgundy are
2003, 2002, 1999, 1997, 1996, and 1995. For white
Burgundy, 2002, 1999, 1997, 1996, 1995, and 1992
are quite good.

Côte Chalonnaise: Bargain Burgundies
The sad fact about Burgundy is that many of its best wines are costly. But one
of Burgundy’s best-kept secrets is the Côte Chalonnaise (the district that lies
directly south of the Côte d’Or). Five villages here are home to some very
decent Burgundies. True, Côte Chalonnaise Burgundies are not as fine as
Côte d’Or Burgundies (they’re a bit earthier and coarser in flavor and tex-
ture), but they can still be satisfying wines — and we’re talking $20 to $35
retail per bottle here. Four villages or communes whose names appear as
appellations on wine labels are the following:
 Mercurey (mer cure ay): Mostly red wine, and a small amount of white;
the best wines of the Chalonnaise come from here, and also the most
expensive ($24 to $35); three of the best producers of Mercurey are
Aubert de Villaine , J.Faiveley, and Antonin Rodet.
 Rully (rue yee): Approximately equal amounts of red and white wine;
the whites, although a bit earthy, are significantly better than the reds;
look for the wines of the producer Antonin Rodet.
 Givry (gee vree): Mostly red wine, and a small amount of white; reds
are better than the whites (but quite earthy); Domaine Joblot’s Givry is
especially worth seeking out.
 Montagny (mon tah nyee): All white wine; look for Antonin Rodet’s and
Louis Latour’s Montagny.
152
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Tips on drinking Burgundy
Red Burgundy is a particularly good wine to
choose in restaurants. Unlike Bordeaux and other
Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines, red Burgundy
is usually approachable when young because of
its softness and its enticing aromas and flavors of
red fruits. Moreover, red Burgundy, like all Pinot
Noirs, is a versatile companion to food. It’s the one
red wine that can complement fish or seafood; it
is ideal with salmon, for example. Chicken, turkey,
and ham are also good matches for Burgundy.
With richer red Burgundies, beef and game (such
as duck, pheasant, rabbit, or venison) all go well.
Red Burgundy is at its best when served at cool
temperatures — about 60° to 62°F (17°C). It
should not be decanted. Even older Burgundies
seldom develop much sediment, and too much
aeration would cause you to lose the wonderful
Burgundy aroma, which is one of the greatest
features of this wine.
On the other hand, white Burgundy often bene-
fits from decanting, especially grand cru and
premier cru white Burgundies from younger vin-
tages (five years old or younger). Great young
white Burgundies, such as Corton Charlemagne,
just don’t evolve completely in their first few
years; the extra aeration will help bring out their
aromas and flavors. And remember, don’t serve
them too cold! The ideal temperature range for
serving the better white Burgundies is 58° to
62°F (15° to 17°C).

Another village specializes in the Aligoté grape (a second white grape permitted
in Burgundy) that makes a particularly crisp and lively wine called Bouzeroon
(boo zer ohn). Aubert de Villaine is the quality producer here; try his Bourgogne
Rouge, Bourgogne Blanc (made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay respectively),
or Bourgogne Aligoté de Bouzeron.
Chablis: Unique white wines
The village of Chablis, northwest of the Côte d’Or, is the closest Burgundian
commune to Paris (about a two-hour drive). Although Chablis’ wines are
100 percent Chardonnay just like the white Burgundies of the Côte d’Or,
they’re quite different in style. For one thing, almost all Côte d’Or white
Burgundies ferment and age in oak barrels, but many Chablis producers use
stainless steel tanks instead, at least for some of their wines. Also, Chablis’
climate is cooler, producing wines that are intrinsically lighter-bodied, rela-
tively austere in flavor, and crisper.
Chablis wine is classically very dry and sometimes has flinty flavors, without
quite the richness and ripeness of Côte d’Or white Burgundies. (Recent Chablis
vintages — such as 1997, 2000, and 2003 — have been so warm, however, that
the wines have been tasting riper than usual.) For a classic, cool-climate
Chablis, try a bottle from the 2004, 2002, or 1996 vintage. The 2005 Chablis
vintage, by the way, is just being released as we write and is supposed to be
fantastic!
Chablis is an ideal companion to seafood, especially oysters. Like all other
white Burgundies, Chablis should be served cool (58° to 60°F, or 15°C),
not cold.
The Chablis worth trying
Chablis is at its best at the premier cru and grand cru level. Simple village
Chablis is less expensive — about $18 to $28 — but you can often find better
white wines from Mâcon, the Chalonnaise, or the Côte d’Or (Bourgogne Blanc)
at that price.
The seven grand cru Chablis vineyards are Les Clos, Valmur, Les Preuses,
Vaudésir, Grenouilles, Bougros, and Blanchot. (Another vineyard that’s 
actually — but not technically — grand cru is La Moutonne; this vineyard is a
part of the Vaudésir and Les Preuses grand cru acreage but isn’t recognized
as a Grand Cru appellation.) Grand cru Chablis wines range in price from $60
to $95, depending on the producer. Grand cru Chablis from good vintages
(see Appendix C) can age and improve for 15 years.
153
Chapter 9: Doing France

The Chablis district has 22 premier cru Chablis appellations, but the six most
well-known are Fourchaume, Montée de Tonnerre, Vaillons, Mont de Milieu,
Montmains, and Les Forêts (also known as Forest). Premier cru Chablis wines
range in price from $32 to $55, depending on the producer, and can age up to
ten years in good vintages.
Seven outstanding producers of Chablis
Seven producers really stand out in Chablis. For a true understanding of this
underrated wine, try to buy their grand or premier cru Chablis. Try is the
operative word here; these are small producers whose wines are available
only in better stores:
 Francois Raveneau and René et Vincent Dauvissat: Both use oak for fer-
menting and aging; thus the wines are fairly rich and substantial.
 Louis Michel: Uses stainless steel only, making vibrant, crisp wines.
 Jean Dauvissat: Uses mainly stainless steel.
 Jean Collet, Jean-Paul Droin, and Verget: Other consistently fine pro-
ducers of Chablis.
Mâcon: Affordable whites
If you’re thinking that $20 or more sounds like too much to spend for a bottle
of white Burgundy or Chablis for everyday drinking, we have an alternative
wine for you: white Mâcon. Many of the best white wine buys — not only in
France, but in the world — come from the Mâconnais district.
The Mâconnais lies directly south of the Chalonnaise and north of Beaujolais.
It has a milder, sunnier climate than the Côte d’Or to the north. Wine production
centers around the city of Mâcon, a gateway city to Provence and the Riviera.
The hills in the Mâconnais contain the same chalky limestone beloved by
Chardonnay that can be found in many Burgundy districts to the north.
In Mâcon, you can even find a village called Chardonnay.
Mâcon’s white wines, in fact, are 100 percent Chardonnay. Most of them are
simply called Mâcon or Mâcon-Villages (a slightly better wine than Mâcon,
because it comes from specific villages), and they retail for $11 to $17 a
bottle. Often better are Mâcons that come from just one village; in those
wines, the name of the village is appended to the district name, Mâcon 
(as in Mâcon-Lugny or Mâcon-Viré).
154
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Mâcon whites are medium-bodied, crisp, fresh, and yet substantial wines,
often with minerally flavor. They’re usually unoaked. You should enjoy
them while they’re young, generally within three years of the vintage.
The best Mâcon whites come from the southernmost part of the district and
carry their own appellations — Pouilly-Fuissé (pwee fwee say) and Saint-Véran
(san ver ahn).
 Pouilly-Fuissé is a richer, fuller-bodied wine than a simple Mâcon, is
often oaked, and is a bit more expensive (around $20 to $25; up to $45
for the best examples). To try an outstanding example of Pouilly-Fuissé,
buy Château Fuissé, which, in good vintages, compares favorably with
more expensive Cote d’Or white Burgundies.
 Saint-Véran, at $14 to $19, is very possibly the best-value wine in all of
Mâcon. Especially fine is the Saint-Véran of Verget, who is one of the best
producers of Mâconnais wines.
Beaujolais: As delightful 
as it is affordable
The Beaujolais district is situated south of the Mâconnais, in the heart of one
of the greatest gastronomic centers of the world; good restaurants abound
in the area, as well as in the nearby city of Lyon. As a wine, Beaujolais is so
famous that it stands apart from the other wines of Burgundy. It even has its
own red grape, Gamay. The fact that Beaujolais is part of Burgundy is merely
a technicality.
155
Chapter 9: Doing France
Celebration time: Beaujolais Nouveau
Each year on the third Thursday in November, the
new vintage of Beaujolais — called Beaujolais
Nouveau — is released all over the world with
great fanfare. This youngster — only about six
weeks old! — is a very grapey, easy-to-drink,
delicious wine with practically no tannin but lots
of fruitiness. In the United States, Beaujolais
Nouveau graces many a Thanksgiving table
because of the timing of its annual debut. It sells
for $7 to $10 and is at its best within the first year
of the vintage.

The easy-drinking Beaujolais
If you’re a white wine, white Zinfandel, or rosé wine drinker (or even a non-
wine drinker!), Beaujolais may be the ideal first red wine to drink — a bridge,
so to speak, to more serious red wines. Beaujolais wines are the fruitiest red
wines in France, although they’re dry. Beaujolais is truly a fun wine that’s
delicious and doesn’t require contemplation.
Beaujolais and Beaujolais Supérieur (one percent higher in alcohol) are the
easiest Beaujolais wines. Their AOC territories extend across the whole
Beaujolais district, but actually these wines come from the southern part
of Beaujolais where the soil is mainly clay and sand. They’re fresh, fruity,
uncomplicated, fairly light-bodied wines that sell for $8 to $12 and are best a
year or two after the vintage. They’re fine wines for warm weather, when a
heavier red wine would be inappropriate.
The serious versions
Beaujolais has its serious side, too. The best Beaujolais are made in the
northern part of the Beaujolais district where the soil is granite-based.
Beaujolais-Villages is a wine blended from grapes grown in (some of) 
39 specific villages that produce fuller, more substantial wine than simple
Beaujolais. It costs a dollar or two more, but can be well worth the difference.
Beaujolais that’s even higher quality comes from ten specific areas in the
north. The wines of these areas are known as cru Beaujolais, and only the
name of the cru appears in large letters on the label. (The wines aren’t actu-
ally named Beaujolais.) Cru Beaujolais have more depth and, in fact, need a
little time to develop; some of the crus can age and improve for four or five
years or more. They range in price from about $11 to $24. Table 9-7 lists the
ten cru Beaujolais as they are geographically situated, from south to north,
along with a brief description of each cru.
156
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Beaujolais in action
To really get a feeling for being in France, visit a
bistro in Paris or Lyon and order a carafe of
young Beaujolais with your charcuterie, pâté, or
chicken. No wine slides down the throat as
easily! Young, uncomplicated Beaujolais wines
should definitely be served chilled, at about 55°F
(13°C), to capture their fruity exuberance. The
fuller cru Beaujolais, on the other hand, are best
at about the same temperature as red Burgundy
(58° to 60°F; 14°C).

Table 9-7
The Ten Cru Beaujolais
Cru
Description
Brouilly (broo yee)
The largest cru in terms of production and the most variable
in quality; light and fruity; drink within three years
Côte de Brouilly
Distinctly better than Brouilly, fuller and more concentrated;
vineyards are higher in altitude; drink within three years
Regnié (ray nyay)
The newest village to be recognized as a cru; very similar to
Brouilly; not quite as good as Côte de Brouilly
Morgon (mor gohn)
At its best, full and earthy; can age for five to seven years
Chiroubles 
One of our favorites; the quintessential, delicate, delicious, 
(sheh roob leh)
perfumed Beaujolais; tastes of young red fruits; very pretty;
drink it within two years of the vintage
Fleurie (flehr ee)
Medium-bodied, rich, with a velvety fruitiness; the most pop-
ular cru (and, along with Moulin-á-Vent, the most expensive,
at $16 to $22); quite reliable; can age for four years
Moulin-à-Vent 
Clearly the most powerful, concentrated cru, and the one
(moo lahn ah vahn)
that can age the longest (ten years or more); this is one
Beaujolais that really needs three or four years to develop
Chénas (shay nahs)
Bordering Moulin-à-Vent (in fact, much of it can be legally
sold as the more famous Moulin-à-Vent); what is sold as
Chénas is usually well priced; drink within four years
Juliénas 
The insider’s Beaujolais; often the most consistent and the 
(jhool yay nahs)
best of the crus; full-bodied and rich, can last five years or
more; seldom disappoints
Saint-Amour 
The most northerly cru in Beaujolais; perfectly named for 
(sant ah more)
loverson Valentine’s Day (or any other day); supple, light to
medium-bodied, delicious berry fruit; drink within two or
three years
Most Beaujolais is sold by large négociants — firms that buy grapes and wine
from growers and blend, bottle, and sell the wine under their own labels. Two
of the largest and most reliable Beaujolais négociants are Georges Duboeuf
and Louis Jadot; Jadot also owns a few very fine domaines, in Moulin-a-Vent
and in Morgon. (For a list of other Beaujolais producers, see Chapter 8 in
French Wine For Dummies.)
157
Chapter 9: Doing France

The Hearty Rhônes of the Valley
The Rhône (rone) Valley is in southeastern France, south of Beaujolais,
between the city of Lyon in the north and Avignon directly south (just north of
Provence). The growing season in the Rhône Valley is sunny and hot. The wines
reflect the weather: The red wines are full, robust, and fairly high in alcohol.
Even some of the white wines tend to be full and powerful. But the wines from
the southern part of the Rhône are distinctly different from those in the north-
ern Rhône Valley. (For a detailed explanation of how the Northern and Southern
Rhône differ as wine districts, read Chapter 9 of French Wine For Dummies.)
For a good, reliable dry red wine that costs about $9 to $14, look no farther
than the Rhône Valley’s everyday red wine, Côtes du Rhône, which comes
mainly from the southern part of the region. The Rhône Valley makes more
serious wines — mostly red — but Côtes du Rhône is one of the best inexpen-
sive red wines in the world.
Generous wines of the south
Most (in fact, about 95 percent of) Rhône wines come from the Southern
Rhône, where the wines are generally inexpensive and uncomplicated.
They’re mainly blends of several grape varieties. The dominant grape variety
in the southern Rhône is the prolific Grenache, which makes easygoing wines
that are high in alcohol and low in tannin — but some blends contain signifi-
cant amounts of Syrah or other varieties, which makes for somewhat gutsier
wines. Almost all Côtes du Rhône wines are red (94 percent red, 3 percent
white, 3 percent rosé).
Besides Côtes du Rhône, other southern Rhône wines to look for are
 Côtes du Ventoux (vahn too), which is similar to, but a bit lighter than,
Côtes du Rhône
 Côtes du Rhône-Villages, from 95 villages, making fuller and a bit
more expensive wines than Côtes du Rhône; 16 of these villages are 
entitled to use their names on the label, such as “Cairanne — Côtes du
Rhône-Villages”
 The single-village wines Gigondas (jhee gon dahs) and Vacqueyras
(vah keh rahs)
The last two wines are former Côtes du Rhône-Villages wines that graduated
to individual appellations. Gigondas ($30 to $35) is particularly rich and
robust and can live for ten years or more in good vintages. Vacqueyras is less
powerful and robust than Gigondas but also less expensive (mainly $14 to
$22); Vacqueyras is a particularly good buy.
158
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Two interesting dry rosé wines of the southern Rhône are Tavel (tah vel)
and Lirac (lee rahk); Lirac is less well known and therefore less expensive.
(Tavel ranges from $17 to $30, Lirac a little less; Lirac can also be white or red.)
Both are made from the Grenache and Cinsault grapes. They can be delightful
on hot, summer days or at picnics. As with most rosé wines, they are best
when they’re very young.
But Châteauneuf-du-Pape (shah toe nuf doo pahp) is the king in the
Southern Rhône. Its name recalls the fourteenth century, when nearby
Avignon (not Rome) was the home of the Popes. Almost all Châteauneuf-du-
Pape is red wine, and a blend of grapes: As many as 13 varieties can be used,
but Grenache, Mourvèdre, and Syrah predominate. At its best, Châteauneuf-
du-Pape is full-bodied, rich, round, and ripe. In good vintages, it will age well
for 15 to 20 years. Most red Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines (a small amount of
very earthy-style white Châteauneuf-du-Pape is also made) retail in the $28 to
$45 price range, but the best ones can cost up $70 or more. Two of the finest
Châteauneuf-du-Papes are Château Rayas (nearly 100 percent Grenache from
very old vines) and Château de Beaucastel (which can age 20 years or more).
Noble wines of the north
The two best red wines of the entire Rhône — Côte-Rôtie (coat roe tee) and
Hermitage (er mee tahj) — hail from the Northern Rhône Valley. Both are made
from the noble Syrah grape (but some white Viognier grapes are sometimes
used in Côte Rôtie).
Although both are rich, full-bodied wines, Côte-Rôtie is the more finesseful of
the two. It has a wonderfully fragrant aroma — which always reminds us of
green olives and raspberries — and soft, fruity flavors. In good vintages, Côte
Rôtie can age for 20 years or more (see Appendix C). Most Côte-Rôties are in
the $45 to $85 price range.
The most famous producer of Côte-Rôtie is Guigal; his single-vineyard 
Côte-Rôties — La Mouline, La Landonne, and La Turque — are legendary
but rare and particularly expensive (over $200 a bottle!).
Red Hermitage is clearly the most full-bodied, longest-lived Rhône wine. It is a
complex, rich, tannic wine that needs several years before it begins to develop,
and it will age easily for 30 years or more in good vintages (2003, 1999, 1998,
1995, 1991, 1990, 1989, and 1988 were all excellent vintages in the Northern
Rhone). The best red Hermitages sell today for $50 to $90, and a few are even
over $100, although lesser Hermitages are as low as $40 to $45.
The three best producers of Hermitage are Jean-Louis Chave, Chapoutier, and
Paul Jaboulet Ainé (for his top Hermitage, La Chapelle).
159
Chapter 9: Doing France

Jaboulet also makes a less expensive little brother to Hermitage, a Crozes-
Hermitage (a separate appellation) called Domaine de Thalabert. It’s as
good as — if not better than — many Hermitages, can age and improve for
10 to 15 years in good vintages, and is reasonably priced at $28 to $30. It’s a
wine to buy.
Cornas, also made entirely from Syrah, is another fine Northern Rhône red
wine. Cornas resembles Hermitage in that it is a huge, tannic wine that needs
10 to 20 years of aging. It ranges in price from $40 to $80. Two Cornas produc-
ers to look for are Domaine August Clape and Jean-Luc Colombo.
A small amount of white Hermitage is produced from the Marsanne and
Roussanne grape varieties. White Hermitage is traditionally a full, heavy,
earthy wine that needs eight to ten years to fully develop. Chapoutier’s fine
Hermitage Blanc, Chante-Alouette, however, is all Marsanne (about $80) and
made in a more approachable style. The other great white Hermitage is
Chave’s; about $90, it’s complex, rich, and almost as long-lived as his red
Hermitage.
Condrieu (cohn dree oo), made entirely from Viognier, is the other white wine
to try in the Northern Rhône. It’s one of the most fragrant, floral dry wines in
existence. Its flavors are delicate but rich, with delicious fresh apricot and
peach notes; it makes a wonderful accompaniment to fresh fish. Condrieu
(which sells for $45 to $60) is best young, however. And, because Condrieu is
a small wine zone, the best Condrieu wines are hard to find. Look for them in
finer wine shops and better French restaurants. (For more info on Rhône
wines and producers, see Chapter 9 in French Wine For Dummies.)
The Loire Valley: White Wine Heaven
Have you been Chardonnay-ed out yet? If you’re looking for white-wine alter-
natives to Chardonnay, discover the Loire (l’wahr) Valley wine region. A lot
of white wines come from there, but virtually none of them are Chardonnay!
For the record, you can find red wines and some dry rosés, too, in the Loire,
but the region is really known for its white wines.
The Loire Valley stretches across northwest France, following the path of the
Loire River from central France in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west.
The rather cool climate, especially in the west, produces relatively light-
bodied white wines. The Loire Valley has three sections: the Upper Loire, the
Central Loire Valley, and the Pays Nantais (pay ee nahn tay), named after the
city of Nantes, right where the Loire River empties into the Atlantic Ocean.
In the eastern end of the Valley (Upper Loire), just south of Paris, are the
towns of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire, located on opposite banks of the
Loire River. Here, the Sauvignon Blanc grape makes lively, dry wines that
have spicy, green-grass and minerally flavors. The two principal wines in this
area are Sancerre (sahn sehr) and Pouilly-Fumé (pwee foo may).
160
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

 Sancerre is the lighter, drier, and more vibrant of the two. It’s perfect for
summer drinking, especially with shellfish or light, freshwater fish, such
as trout. Look for the Sancerres of Domaines Henri Bourgeois or Lucien
Crochet.
 Pouilly-Fumé is slightly fuller than Sancerre and can have attractive gun-
flint and mineral flavors. Pouilly-Fumé can be quite a fine wine when
made by a good producer such as Didier Dagueneau or Ladoucette.
Because of its fuller weight, Pouilly-Fumé goes well with rich fish, such
as salmon, or with chicken or veal.
Most Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé wines sell in the $20 to $35 range, but a few
of the better Pouilly-Fumés can cost $50 or more. These wines are at their
best when they’re young; drink them within four years of the vintage.
The central Loire Valley is known for both its white and red wines. The Chenin
Blanc grape makes better wine here than it does anywhere else in the world.
The Anjou district produces arguably the world’s greatest dry Chenin Blanc
wine, Savennières (starts at about $20). A great dessert white wine made
from Chenin Blanc, Coulée de Serrant, also comes from Anjou. Bonnezeaux
and Quartz-de-Chaume are two other dessert white wine appellations from
Anjou that are made from Chenin Blanc.
Near the city of Tours (where you can see beautiful chateaux of former
French royalty), lies the town of Vouvray (voo vray). Vouvray wines come
in three styles: dry (sec), medium-dry (demi-sec), or sweet (called moelleux,
pronounced m’wah leuh). Vouvray also can be a sparkling wine.
The best wines of Vouvray, the sweet (moelleux), can be made only in vintages
of unusual ripeness, which occur infrequently. These wines need several years
to develop and can last almost forever, thanks to their remarkable acidity;
their prices begin at about $22. Three renowned Vouvray producers are
Philippe Foreau of Clos Naudain, Gaston Huet-Pinguet, and Didier Champalou.
Less expensive Vouvrays, priced at about $14 to $15, are pleasant to drink
young. Even the drier versions are not truly bone dry and are a good choice
if you don’t enjoy very dry wines. They go well with chicken or veal in cream
sauce, spicy cuisines, or fruit and soft cheese after dinner.
The Loire Valley’s best red wines also come from the Central Loire. Made
mainly from Cabernet Franc, they carry the place-names of the villages
the grapes come from: Chinon (shee nohn), Bourgueil (boorguh’y), Saint-
Nicolas-de-Bourgueil (san nee co lah deh boor guh’y), and Saumur-Champigny
(saw muhr shahm pee n’yee). They’re all spicy, great-value ($12 to $35),
medium-bodied reds that are famously food friendly.
Close to the Atlantic Ocean, the third wine district of the Loire Valley is the
home of the Muscadet grape (also known as the Melon). The wine, also
called Muscadet (moos cah day), is light and very dry, with apple and mineral
flavors — perfect with clams, oysters, and river fish (and, naturally, ideal for
summer drinking).
161
Chapter 9: Doing France

Most Muscadet comes from the Sèvre-et-Maine AOC zone, and those words
appear on the label. Frequently you also see the term sur lie, which means
that the wine aged on its lees (fermentation yeasts) and was bottled straight
from the tank. This procedure gives the wine liveliness, freshness, and some-
times a slight prickle of carbon dioxide on the tongue.
The best news about Muscadet is the price. You can buy a really good
Muscadet for $9 to $12. Buy the youngest one you can find because Muscadet
is best within two years of the vintage; it isn’t an ager. (See Chapter 12 in
French Wine For Dummies for more on Loire Valley wines and producers.)
Alsace Wines: French, Not German
It’s understandable that some wine drinkers confuse the wines of Alsace
(ahl zas) with German wines. Alsace, in northeastern France, is just across
the Rhine River from Germany. Originally a part of Germany, Alsace became
French in the seventeenth century. Germany took the region back in 1871
only to lose it to France again in 1919 as a result of World War I. To compli-
cate things further, both Alsace and Germany grow some of the same grapes
(Riesling and Gewürztraminer, for example). But Alsace wines are distinctly
different from German wines, generally dry, and fuller bodied.
Alsace wines are unique among French wines in that almost all of them carry
a grape variety name as well as a place-name (that is, Alsace). All Alsace wines
come in a long-necked bottle called a flûte. The wines of Alsace also happen
to represent very good value.
Considering Alsace’s northerly latitude, you’d expect the region’s climate to
be cool. But thanks to the protection of the Vosges Mountains to the west,
Alsace’s climate is quite sunny and temperate, and one of the driest in
France — in short, perfect weather for grape growing.
162
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Here a Pouilly, there a Pouilly
You may get the two Pouilly wines — Pouilly-
Fuissé and Pouilly-Fumé — confused, but they’re
very different wines. The Chardonnay-based
Pouilly-Fuissé, from the Mâcon in Burgundy, is a
full-bodied wine and usually oaky. Pouilly-Fumé,
made from Sauvignon Blanc, is medium-bodied
and crisper.

Although some Pinot Noir exists, 91 percent of Alsace’s wines are white.
Four are particularly important: Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, and
Gewurztraminer. Each reflects the characteristics of its grape, but they all
share a certain aroma and flavor, sometimes called a spiciness, that can only
be described as the flavor of Alsace.
Riesling is the king of Alsace wines (remember that it’s a dry wine here).
Alsace Riesling has a fruity aroma but a firm, dry, almost steely taste.
Although, like most Alsace wines, it can be consumed young, a Riesling
from a good vintage can easily age and improve for ten years or more.
Rieslings are in the $15 to $35 price range; a few of the best are over $35.
Alsace Pinot Blanc is the lightest of the four wines. Some producers make their
Pinot Blanc medium-dry to appeal to wine drinkers who are unfamiliar with
the region’s wines, while others make classic, bone-dry Pinot Blanc. Either
way, it’s best young. Pinot Blanc is quite inexpensive, selling for $12 to $20.
Pinot Gris or Tokay-Pinot Gris (the “Tokay” part of the name is being
dropped to avoid confusion with the famous Hungarian dessert wine, Tokaji)
is made from Pinot Gris, the same variety that you find in Italy as Pinot Grigio.
Here in Alsace, it makes a rich, spicy, full-bodied, characterful wine. Alsace’s
Pinot Gris retails for $15 to $30; it goes well with spicy meat dishes and can
work with slightly sweet or sour flavors.
The Gewürztraminer grape has such intense, exotic, spicy aromas and flavors
that it’s a love-it-or-leave-it wine. (One of us loves it — the other leaves it!)
But it certainly has its followers. And this grape is clearly at its best in Alsace.
If you haven’t tried an Alsace Gewurztraminer yet, you haven’t tasted one of
the most distinctive wines in the world. It’s quite low in acidity and high in
alcohol, a combination that gives an impression of fullness and softness. It goes
best with foie gras and strong cheeses, and some people like it with spicy Asian
cuisine. Gewurztraminer sells for about the same price as Riesling but doesn’t
age quite as well.
For more info on Alsace wines and producers, see Chapter 11 in French Wine
For Dummies.
The South and Southwest
The most dynamic wine regions in France are all located in the southern part
of the country. Ironically, this is the oldest wine-producing area in France:
The Greeks made wine in Provence in the sixth century BC. The South is also
the part of France that makes the most wine. Languedoc-Roussillon, a dual
wine region, produces over 40 percent of France’s wine!
163
Chapter 9: Doing France

Most southern French wines didn’t get much international attention until the
1980s. Now the world has discovered that these wines are vastly improved in
quality, as well as very affordable.
Southwest France, the huge area between Bordeaux and the Spanish border,
also makes wine (well, it’s French, isn’t it?), and many wine regions here have
also experienced a renaissance. Like the South, it’s mainly red wine country,
but you can find some interesting whites, rosés, sparkling wines, and dessert
wines, as well. You might say that the South and Southwestern France are the
country’s “new” frontiers.
The Midi: France’s bargain basement
The sunny, dry Languedoc-Roussillon (lahn guh doc roo see yohn) region,
also known as the Midi (mee dee), has long been the country’s largest wine-
producing area. The region makes mainly red wines; in fact, more than half of
France’s red wines come from here. Traditionally, these robust red wines
came from typical grape varieties of the South, such as Carignan, Cinsault,
and Grenache. But in the last two decades, more serious varieties such as
Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot have become popular with growers.
Winemakers use these grapes both for varietal wines and in blends.
In this region, look especially for the red wines from the AOC zones of
Corbières, Minervois, St-Chinian, Fitou, and Costières de Nîmes. In addition,
many varietal wines carrying the designation Vin de Pays d’Oc are often good
values. They’re made from grapes that can come from anywhere in the
Languedoc-Roussillon region, rather than from a specific AOC zone.
The best news is that most of these wines are in the $8 to $15 price range,
although a few of the better ones cost $20 or more. Two of the better-known
brands of varietal wines (with the Vin de Pays d’Oc appellation) are Fortant
de France and Réserve St. Martin. Even California’s E. & J. Gallo winery now
makes wines from Languedoc-Roussillon under the brand, Red Bicyclette.
Timeless Provence
Provence (pro vahns) — southeast of the Rhône Valley, east of Languedoc-
Roussillon, and west of Northern Italy — may be France’s most beautiful
region. Home of the Riviera, Nice, and Cannes, it’s certainly the country’s
most fashionable and touristy region. But it’s also an ancient land, with a
thriving old capital, Aix-en-Provence. The excellent light and climate have
always attracted great artists — such as Vincent van Gogh — who painted
many of their best works here.
164
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Wine has always been part of Provence’s culture and economy. Provence is
best known for its rosés, which so many tourists enjoy on the Riviera, but
Provence’s red wines are now winning the most critical acclaim. Rosé wines
still dominate in the region’s largest AOC wine zone, Côtes de Provence, but
in three other important AOC zones — Coteaux d’Aix-en-Provence, Les
Baux-de-Provence, and Bandol — red wines rule. Bandol, and its foremost
producer, Domaine Tempier, enjoy Provence’s greatest reputation for reds.
Cassis (no relation to the blackcurrant liqueur of the same name), a small
AOC zone on the Mediterranean coast near Marseilles, makes distinctive, 
aromatic white wines.
Provence’s reds and rosés derive from the same grape varieties used in
Languedoc-Roussillon — Grenache, Cinsault, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Syrah,
and Cabernet Sauvignon. The main varieties in white Cassis are Clairette and
Marsanne.
For more info on the wines and producers of Languedoc-Roussillon and
Provence, see Chapter 13 in French Wine For Dummies.
Southwest France
The large area that borders the Atlantic Ocean south of the Bordeaux region
is known as Southwest France — but it’s actually composed of many individ-
ual wine districts. Three of the most significant are situated near Bordeaux.
 Bergerac (ber jhe rak) makes Bordeaux-like red and white wines, with-
out the Bordeaux prices. Merlot dominates Bergerac’s red wines, while
Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc are the main varieties for its whites, some
of which cost as little as $8 a bottle.
 Monbazillac (mon bah zee yak) specializes in sweet dessert wines simi-
lar to the Sauternes of the Bordeaux region (see Chapter 15 for more on
Sauternes), but Monbazillac’s wines are considerably less expensive —
and less complex — than Sauternes.
 Cahors (cah or) is Southwest France’s most prestigious red wine district.
The main grape variety is Malbec, and that name increasingly appears
on the labels. Nowhere else in the world, except Argentina, does this
variety play such an important role. The best wines of the traditional
Cahors producers, such as Château Lagrezette, are dark, tannic reds that
need about ten years of aging before they mature. Prices for Château
Lagrezette Cahors wines begin at about $23.
165
Chapter 9: Doing France

Two other districts in Southwest France, Gaillac (gah yack) and Jurançon
(joo rahn sohn), specialize in white dessert wines — quite good in quality.
Gaillac also makes fruity, lightly sparkling wines. The AOC red wine district
of Madiran produces full-bodied, tannic reds, perfect for the local, hearty
Gascony cuisine. Tannat is the main variety used in Madiran, along with
Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The last French AOC district before
you cross the Pyrénées Mountains into Spain is Irouléguy (ee roo leh gee);
spicy, tannic red wines are made here by natives who speak not French, but
Basque. (Chapter 14 of French Wine For Dummies provides much more infor-
mation on the wines and producers of Southwest France.)
Other French Wine Regions
Two of France’s three least-known wine regions have something in common:
They’re located in the foothills and slopes of the Alps in eastern France, next
to Switzerland. In fact, skiers are probably the most familiar with their wines.
They are the Jura (joo rah) and Savoie (sah v’wah) — sometimes anglicized
as Savoy.
Jura makes two interesting wines: “Yellow Wine” (Vin Jaune) — made nowhere
else in France — and “Straw Wine” (Vin de Paille), a little of which is also made
in the Northern Rhône. The Yellow Wine, from the Savagnin grape variety, is
comparable to a light Spanish fino Sherry, but it’s not fortified (see Chapter 15).
Château-Chalon is the most famous example of Vins Jaunes (van joh’n). Vin de
Paille (van deh pah’ee) is known as Straw Wine because of the traditional way
in which it’s made: The grapes (Savagnin, Chardonnay and others) are har-
vested late, arranged on straw mats or in baskets, and then placed in attics to
dry — similar to Tuscany’s specialty, Vin Santo (see Chapter 15). The resulting
wine is rich, concentrated, nutty, and raisiny.
Savoie’s wines, mainly white, are typically dry and light-bodied. Seyssel
(say sell), Savoie’s best-known appellation, is known for its slightly sparkling
wines as well as its still whites.
Corsica, renowned historically as the birthplace of Napoleon, is a large,
mountainous island 100 miles southeast of Provence. It’s best known for its
medium-bodied, well-priced red and rosé wines. (For more info on the wines
and producers of France’s minor wine regions, see Chapter 14 in French Wine
For Dummies.)

Italy, the Heartland of Vino
In This Chapter
 Italy’s Big “B” wines
 Chianti: Still famous after all these years
 A trio from Verona
 The vino bianco quality revival
M
ore than 2,000 years after Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, the Italians
continue to take the world by storm. With passion, artistic flair, impec-
cable taste, and flawless workmanship as their weapons, the Italians have
infiltrated the arenas of fashion, film, food, and of course, wine.
Thanks to the popularity of Italian restaurants, most of us have frequent
opportunities to enjoy best-selling Italian wines such as Pinot Grigio, Soave,
Valpolicella, and Chianti. But Italy makes other wines, too — many of them
among the greatest wines on earth. And just about every one of Italy’s 
thousand-something wines is terrific with food, because Italian wines are
made specifically to be enjoyed during a meal. That’s how the Italians
drink them.
In this chapter, we focus on Italy’s three most renowned wine areas —
Piedmont, Tuscany, and Northeastern Italy. We also discuss some of the
other Italian regions whose wines you are likely to find in your wine shop or
ristorante. If you’d like detailed information on Italian wines, be sure to get
our book Italian Wine For Dummies (Wiley).
The Vineyard of Europe
Tiny, overachieving Italy — 60 percent the size of France, three-quarters the
size of California — makes more than 20 percent of the world’s wines! Wine is
the lifeblood of the Italian people. Vines grow all over, and no meal can possi-
bly occur without a bottle of wine on the table.

168
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
The downside to wine’s penetration into Italian culture is that Italians often
take wine for granted. Italy took 28 years longer than France to develop a
wine classification system, for example; and today, 40-plus years after creat-
ing that system, Italy has yet to incorporate official recognition of her best
vineyard sites (crus) into her wine laws, as the French have done in
Burgundy. Italy’s casual attitude toward wine slowed the acceptance of even
the top wines by many serious wine lovers around the world — although
recognition of Italian wines has grown considerably over the past decade.
Another handicap of Italian wines, for wine drinkers in other countries who
want to learn about them, is that most Italian wines are made from native
grape varieties that don’t exist elsewhere (and when transplanted, don’t per-
form nearly as well as in Italy). Grapes such as Nebbiolo, Sangiovese,
Aglianico, and Barbera, to name just a few, can make outstanding wine in
Italy, but their names are unfamiliar. Table 10-1 lists the grape varieties
behind some wines of Italy’s most important wine regions.

On the upside, Italy is blessed with such a variety of soils and climates —
from Alpine foothills in the north to Mediterranean coastlines — that the
range of her wines is almost endless. (A curious wine lover could keep busy
for a lifetime exploring the hundreds of wines in Italy!) Italy’s hilly landscape
provides plenty of high-altitude relief for grapevines even in the warm south.
The ordinary and the elite
Italy’s wines, as we outside of Italy know them, fall into two distinct groups:
 Inexpensive red and white wines for everyday drinking with meals in the
casual Italian fashion
 The better wines, which range from good to great in quality
One of the best-known Italian wines in the first category is Pinot Grigio, the
ubiquitous dry white wine that has become the largest-selling type of
imported wine in the United States. In the second category is Barolo, one of
the world’s finest red wines, along with many other fine Italian wines.
169
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

Categories of Italian wine, 
legally speaking
Because Italy is a member of the European Union, her official system of cate-
gorizing wines (her appellation system) must conform to the two-tier EU
system. (See “The EU hierarchy of wine” in Chapter 4 for more information.)
In the upper tier — Quality Wines Produced in a Specific Region (QWPSR) —
Italy has two categories of wine:
 DOCG wines (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita), trans-
lated as regulated and guaranteed place-name, a small group of elite
wines. The long Italian phrase corresponding to the initials DOCG
appears on the labels of these wines.
 DOC wines (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), translated as regulated
place-name, Italy’s basic QWPSR wines. The phrase Denominazione di
Origine Controllata appears on the labels of these wines.
The terms DOC and DOCG refer both to wine zones and the wines of those
zones. The DOCG Soave, for example, is both a place (a specific production
zone defined and regulated by Italian law, named after a town called Soave)
and the wine of that place.
In the lower EU tier — table wine — Italy has another two categories of wine:
 IGT wines (Indicazione di Geografica Tipica), which are table wines with
a geographic indication on the label. Most of these wines were previ-
ously labeled as vino da tavola followed by a geographic designation,
and you still find this wording on some labels.
 Ordinary table wines that carry no geographical indication except
“Italy.”
Italy’s wine regions
Italy is said to have 20 wine regions, which correspond exactly to her politi-
cal regions (see Figure 10-1). In other words, wine is produced everywhere in
Italy. What we would call a wine region in France, such as Burgundy or
Alsace, we refer to as a wine zone in Italy to avoid confusion with the political
region.

Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

Reds Reign in Piedmont
Piedmont’s claim to wine fame is the Nebbiolo (neb bee OH lo) grape, a noble
red variety that produces great wine only in northwestern Italy. The proof of
Nebbiolo’s nobility is its wines: Barolo (bah RO lo) and Barbaresco (bar bah
RES co) are two of the world’s great red wines. Both are DOCG wines made
entirely from the Nebbiolo grape in the Langhe hills around Alba, and each is
named after a village within its production zone.
Both Barolo and Barbaresco are robust reds — very dry, full-bodied, and high
in tannin, acidity, and alcohol. Their aromas suggest tar, violets, roses, ripe
strawberries, and (sometimes) truffles — the kind that grow in the ground,
not the chocolate! Barolo is more full-bodied than Barbaresco and usually
requires a bit more aging; otherwise, the two wines are very similar. Like
most Italian wines, they show at their best with food. Good Barolo and
Barbaresco wines usually start at $40 and run to well over $100 per bottle.
Most Barolos and Barbarescos are not wines to drink young. Production rules
stipulate that Barolo is not Barolo until it has aged for three years at the
winery, or for five years if it is called Riserva. (Barbaresco’s minimum aging is
two years, or four for Riserva.) But both wines benefit from additional aging.
When traditionally made, Barolo and Barbaresco often require 10 to 15 years’
total aging, from the year of the vintage — and they usually benefit from a few
hours of aeration before drinking to soften their somewhat tough tannins.
(See Chapter 8 for instructions on aerating wine.)
Both Barbaresco and especially Barolo have something in common with
Burgundy in France: You must find a good producer to experience the wine at
its best. To guide you in that endeavor, we list the producers whom we con-
sider the best of Barolo and Barbaresco, in our rough order of preference.
172
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Tradition versus “new-style”
One Barolo can differ from another (and one
Barbaresco from another) quite a lot according
to 
the 
wineries’ 
production 
methods.
Traditionally made wines are more tannic and
need more time to develop but typically have
greater longevity than new-style wines do. The
new-style wines are fruitier in flavor but often
oaky-tasting, and are ready to drink sooner —
as soon as three to five years after they are
released. Some producers are in one winemak-
ing camp or the other, while many producers
make their wines in a middle-ground style.

Some producers — including Giacomo Conterno, both Mascarellos, Giuseppe
Rinaldi, and Bruno Giacosa — clearly make traditionally styled wines; others —
such as Gaja, Altare, and Clerico — make modern-style wines; and some, such
as Ceretto and Vietti, combine aspects of both winemaking styles. (We prefer the
traditionally made wines, but all three styles have some excellent producers.)
Two other good Nebbiolo-based wines, the DOCGs Gattinara (gah tee NAH rah)
and Ghemme (GAE mae), come from northern Piedmont, where the Nebbiolo
grape is called Spanna. Although Gattinara and Ghemme seldom get the praise
that the two Big B’s (Barolo and Barbaresco) enjoy, they offer the same enticing
Nebbiolo aromas and flavors — especially Gattinara — in a less full-bodied
style. Priced at $32 to $45 a bottle, Gattinara from a good producer may be one
of the world’s most underrated wines. Look for Antoniolo’s, and Travaglini’s
Gattinaras; Antichi Vigneti di Cantalupo (about $40) is the leading Ghemme
producer.
Weekday reds
The Piedmontese reserve serious wines like Barolo and Barbaresco for
Sunday dinner or special occasions. What they drink on an everyday basis
are the red wines Dolcetto (dohl CHET to), Barbera (bar BEAR ah), and
Nebbiolo (grown outside of prestigious DOCG zones such as Barolo and
Barbaresco). Of the three, Dolcetto is the lightest-bodied and is usually the
first red wine served in a Piedmontese meal.
173
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

Dolcetto
If you know enough Italian to translate the phrase la dolce vita, you may think
that the name Dolcetto indicates a sweet wine. Actually, the Dolcetto grape
tastes sweet but the wine is distinctly dry and somewhat grapey with notice-
able tannin. Dolcetto is often compared to Beaujolais (France’s easy-drinking
red wine; see Chapter 9), but it’s drier and more tannic than most Beaujolais
wines and goes better with food (at least in our opinion).
Dolcetto sells for $11 to $25. The best Dolcetto wines are from the zones of
Dogliani, Diano d’Alba, and Alba; the labels of these wines carry the grape
name, Dolcetto, along with the name of the area. Just about all our recom-
mended Barolo producers make a Dolcetto, usually Dolcetto d’Alba (from
Alba). A favorite producer of ours who happens to make only Dolcetto di
Dogliani is Quinto Chionetti.
Barbera
While Dolcetto is unique to Piedmont, the Barbera grape is the second most
widely planted red grape variety in all of Italy. (Sangiovese is the most
planted red variety.) But it’s in Piedmont — specifically the Asti and Alba
wine zones — that Barbera excels. It’s a rich, red wine with high acidity and
generous black-cherry fruit character.
Barbera d’Alba is generally a bit fuller, riper, and richer than the leaner Barbera
d’Asti — but Barbera d’Asti from certain old vineyards rivals Barbera d’Alba in
richness and in power. (Link the d’ with the word following it when pronounc-
ing these names: DAL ba, DAHS tee.) Barbera happens to be our favorite every-
day wine, especially with pasta or pizza — or anything tomatoe-y.
Barbera is more popular in the United States than it has ever been, and we
couldn’t be more delighted, as it’s now easier to find. Two different styles of
Barbera are available:
 The traditional style, aged in casks (large oak containers that impart
little, if any, oak flavor to the wine), which sells for about $12 to $25
 The newer style, oak-influenced Barbera aged in barriques (small, new
barrels of French oak), which sells in the $25 to $45 range (somebody
has to pay for those expensive barriques!)
Although both types of Barbera are very good, with a few exceptions we
prefer the simpler, less expensive, traditional style. Frankly, we’re getting
tired of the oak flavor in wines these days, although we do admit that some
barrique-aged Barberas are quite good. Barbera is an unusual red grape vari-
ety in that it has practically no tannin, and so the tannins from the small oak
barrels can complement Barbera wines.
174
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Two particularly good producers of Barbera d’Alba are Vietti and Giacomo
Conterno. Vietti also makes a terrific Barbera d’Asti called “La Crena.”
Nebbiolo
A third weekday red from Piedmont is Nebbiolo (d’Alba or Langhe), made
from Nebbiolo grapes grown in vineyards outside the prized Barolo or
Barbaresco zones. The wine is lighter in body and easier to drink than either
Barolo or Barbaresco, and it sells for about $15 to $20 a bottle. Another varia-
tion is Roero Rosso, made almost entirely from Nebbiolo. (For more specific
information on Piedmontese wines, see Chapter 4 of Italian Wine For
Dummies.)
Whites in a supporting role
Almost all Piedmont’s wines are red, but the region does boast two interesting
dry whites. Gavi, named for a town in southern Piedmont, is a very dry wine
with pronounced acidity, made from the Cortese grape. Most Gavis sell for $13
to $24, while a premium Gavi, La Scolca’s Black Label, costs around $45.
Arneis (ahr NASE) is a white wine produced in the Roero zone near Alba from
a long-forgotten grape also called Arneis, which was rescued by Alfredo
Currado, owner of Vietti winery, nearly 40 years ago. Arneis is a dry to
medium-dry wine with rich texture. It’s best when it is consumed within two
years of the vintage; a bottle sells for $20 to $28. Besides Vietti’s, look for
Bruno Giacosa’s and Ceretto’s Arneis.
Tuscany the Beautiful
Florence, Siena, Michelangelo’s David, the leaning tower of Pisa . . . the beau-
tiful region of Tuscany has more than her share of attractions. Only one wine
can possibly compare in fame — and that, too, comes from Tuscany: Chianti.
Chianti: Italy’s great, underrated red
Chianti is a large wine zone extending through much of Tuscany. The zone —
all of it DOCG status, deservedly or not — has eight districts. Chianti wines
may use the name of the district where their grapes grow or the simpler
appellation, Chianti, if their production does not qualify for a district name (if
grapes from two districts are blended, for example).
175
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

The district known as Chianti Classico is the heartland of the zone, the best
area, and — lucky for us — the one district whose wines are widely available.
The only other Chianti district that comes close to rivaling Chianti Classico in
quality is Chianti Rufina (ROO fee nah; not to be confused with the renowned
Chianti producer Ruffino), whose wines are fairly available, especially from
the well-known producer Frescobaldi.
Besides varying according to their district of production, Chianti wines vary
in style according to their aging. Riserva wines must age for two years or
more at the winery, and some of this aging is often in French oak; the best ris-
ervas have potential for long life. Chianti wines can also vary slightly accord-
ing to their grape blend: Many top Chiantis are made almost entirely from the
Sangiovese grape, while others use up to 25 percent of other varieties, includ-
ing “international” varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah.
Chianti is a very dry red wine that, like most Italian wines, tastes best with
food. It ranges from light-bodied to almost full-bodied, according to the dis-
trict, producer, vintage, and aging regime. It often has an aroma of cherries
and sometimes violets, and has a flavor reminiscent of tart cherries. The best
Chianti wines have very concentrated fruit character and usually taste best
from five to eight years after the vintage — although in good vintages they
have no problem aging for ten or more years.
Although Chianti is not a huge wine, today’s Chianti wines, especially Chianti
Classico, are richer and more concentrated than ever before — in some
cases, too rich for us. Recent warm vintages in Europe, such as 1997, 2000,
and 2003, have fed a trend toward ripeness, fleshiness of texture, and higher
alcohol. The addition of international varieties and the use of barriques for
aging — especially for riservas — has also affected the wines. More than
ever, you must choose your Chianti producers with care.
The two exceptional vintages to look for in Chianti wines are 1999 and 2001 —
two of the better Tuscan vintages of modern times.
We have compiled a list of our favorite producers, Group A (for us, the best)
and Group B (our other favorites), in alphabetical order within each group
(For more info on Chianti wines, see Chapter 8 in Italian Wine For Dummies.):
Another producer we admire is Montevertine, who chose to drop the Chianti
name from its labels almost 30 years ago, but who produces excellent 100
percent Sangiovese wine in the Chianti Classico region.

From simple $10 to $15 Chianti to the more substantial Chianti Classico (gen-
erally between $15 and $25), Chianti remains one of the wine world’s great
values. Chianti Classico Riservas are a bit more costly, ranging from $28 to
$45 per bottle.
Monumental Brunello di Montalcino
While Chianti has been famous for centuries, another great Tuscan wine,
Brunello di Montalcino, exploded on the international scene only some 35
years ago, when the Biondi-Santi family, a leading producer, presented some
of its oldest wines to writers. Their 1888 and 1891 vintages were still drinking
well; in fact, they were in excellent shape! The rest is history, as they say.
Today, Brunello di Montalcino (brew NEL lo dee mon tahl CHEE no), a DOCG
wine, is considered one of the greatest, long-lived red wines in existence. It
has a price-tag to match: $45 to over $200 a bottle (for wines by the producer
Soldera).
177
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

The wine is named for the town of Montalcino, a walled fortress town south
of the Chianti zone. Brunello di Montalcino comes from a particular clone, or
strain, of Sangiovese, the grape of Chianti. It’s an intensely concentrated,
tannic wine that demands aging (up to 20 years) when traditionally made,
and benefits from several hours of aeration before serving. Lately, some pro-
ducers in Montalcino have been making a more approachable style of
Brunello.
Rosso di Montalcino is a less expensive ($23 to $30), readier-to-drink wine
made from the same grape and grown in the same production area as
Brunello di Montalcino. Rosso di Montalcino from a good Brunello producer
is a great value, offering you a glimpse of Brunello’s majesty without breaking
the bank.
To really appreciate Brunello di Montalcino, try a wine from one of the pro-
ducers recommended in the following list (in our rough order of preference).
Traditional winemakers, such as Biondi-Santi, Soldera, Costanti, Canalicchio
di Sopra, and Pertimali, make wines that need at least 15 to 20 years of aging
in good vintages (2001, 1999, 1997, 1995, 1990, 1988, 1985, and 1975 are recent
great vintages for Brunello). Brunellos from avowed modern-style producers,
such as Caparzo, Altesino, and Col d’Orcia, can be enjoyed in ten years.
Younger than ten years — drink Rosso di Montalcino! (For a more complete
listing of Brunello di Montalcino producers, see Chapter 8 in Italian Wine For
Dummies.)

Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Brunello with American roots
The largest producer of Brunello di Montalcino
is actually an American family — the Mariani
family of Long Island, NY. In 1978, they estab-
lished Castello Banfi in the southern part of the
Montalcino zone, and today they are leaders in
research into the grapes and terroirs of
Montalcino.

Vino Nobile, Carmignano, and Vernaccia
Three more Tuscan wines of note include two reds — Vino Nobile di
Montepulciano (NO be lay dee mon tay pul chee AH no) and Carmignano (car
mee NYAH no) — and Tuscany’s most renowned white wine, Vernaccia di San
Gimignano (ver NAH cha dee san gee mee NYAH no). All three are DOCG
wines.
The Montepulciano wine zone, named after the town of Montepulciano, is
southeast of the Chianti zone. Vino Nobile’s principal grape is the Prugnolo
Gentile (a.k.a. Sangiovese). From a good producer, Vino Nobile di
Montepulciano can rival the better Chianti Classicos. Nine producers we rec-
ommend are Boscarelli, Fattoria del Cerro, Avignonesi, Lodola Nuova, La
Braccesca, Dei, Tenuta Trerose, Fassati, and Poliziano. Vino Nobile producers
also make a lighter, readier-to-drink wine, Rosso di Montepulciano.
The Carmignano wine region is directly west of Florence. Although
Sangiovese is the main grape of Carmignano — just as it is for Chianti —
Cabernet Sauvignon is also one of this wine zone’s traditional grapes. As a
result, Carmignano’s taste is rather akin to that of a Chianti with the finesse-
ful touch of a Bordeaux. Two outstanding producers of Carmignano are Villa
di Capezzana and Ambra.
Vernaccia di San Gimignano is named for the medieval walled town of San
Gimignano, west of the Chianti Classico zone. Vernaccia is generally a fresh
white wine with a slightly oily texture and an almond flavor, and it is meant to
be drunk young. For an unusual interpretation, try Teruzzi & Puthod’s oak-
aged riserva, Terre di Tufo, a pricey but very good Vernaccia (about $18).
Most Vernaccias are in the $11 to $13 range. Besides Teruzzi & Puthod, pro-
ducers to seek are Montenidoli, Mormoraia, Cecchi, and Casale-Falchini.
Two more reds and a white
So many good Tuscan wines exist that we sometimes don’t know when to
stop talking about them (that’s why we wrote Italian Wine For Dummies!).
Three more deserve a mention here.
Pomino (po MEE no) is the name of a red and a white wine from a tiny area of
the same name, which lies within the Chianti Rufina district. A hilly land with
a particularly mild climate, Pomino has long been a stronghold of French
varieties, right in the heart of Sangiovese-land. The Frescobaldi family, the
major producer of Chianti Rufina, is also the main landowner in Pomino, and
179
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

makes both a Pomino Rosso and a Pomino Bianco — but the red is the more
noteworthy of the two. Pomino Rosso is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Sangiovese, Canaiolo — and in Frescobaldi’s case,
also Pinot Nero (the Italian name for Pinot Noir). It sounds like a crazy blend,
but it works! Pomino Bianco blends Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Trebbiano,
and often Pinot Grigio. Besides Frescobaldi, another fine producer of Pomino
is Fattoria Petrognano. Pomino costs about $24 to $30.
The new frontier for Tuscan wine is the Maremma (mah REM mah) in south-
west Tuscany. Of the many wines coming from this area, two that impress us
are the red, Morellino di Scansano, and the white, Vermentino. Morellino
(moh rehl LEE no) is the name for Sangiovese in the hilly area around the
town of Scansano (scahn SAH no). Most Morellino di Scansano wines offer an
easy-drinking, inexpensive ($12 to $20) alternative to Chianti — although a
few high-end examples exist. Look for Fattoria Le Pupille and Moris Farms.
Vermentino, an aromatic white varietal wine popular in Sardinia and Liguria,
has suddenly become the hot new variety in Tuscany, especially along the
coast. It’s a crisp, medium-bodied, flavorful white that’s usually unoaked, and
sells for $15 to $20. Many leading Tuscan producers, such as Antinori and
Cecchi, are making attractive Vermentino wines.
Super-Tuscans
When Chianti sales lost momentum in the 1970s, progressive producers
caught the attention of the world by creating new red wines that are today
collectively known as super-Tuscans. The pioneering examples include
Sassicaia (sas ee KYE ah), from Marchese Incisa della Rocchetta, and
Tignanello (tee nyah NEL loh) and Solaia (so LYE ah) from Marchesi Antinori.
These and similar wines can’t be called Chianti — either because they’re pro-
duced outside the Chianti zone or because their grape blend (generally
Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and/or Sangiovese) doesn’t con-
form to DOC requirements for Chianti.
Today, dozens of super-Tuscan wines exist. Their grape blends vary; some
producers use only native Tuscan grapes, while others use international vari-
eties or a blend of Italian and international grapes. What these wines have in
common is that they’re expensive, ranging from $45 on up to $80, with a few
well over $100 per bottle. The most famous super-Tuscan wines, Sassicaia,
Ornellaia, Masseto, and Solaia, prized by wine collectors, can cost $200 in
good vintages (see “Tuscany” in the vintage chart, Appendix C).
Super-Tuscan wines can range in taste from very good Chianti-like wines to
Bordeaux-type or California Cabernet-type wines, depending on the varying
amounts of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and so on, and their spe-
cific vineyard areas.
180
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Now that Chianti has reestablished itself in the world market, these relatively
new wines have become less prominent — but most major Chianti producers
still make a super-Tuscan wine.
A dozen of our favorite super-Tuscan wines are the following (listed alphabet-
ically, with their grape blend; the producer’s name is in parentheses):
 Cepparello — all Sangiovese (Isole e Elena)
 Grattamacco — Sangiovese, Malvasia Nera, Cabernet Sauvignon
(Grattamacco)
 Masseto — all Merlot (Tenuta dell’Ornellaia)
 Ornellaia — mainly Cabernet Sauvignon; some Merlot and/or Cabernet
Franc (Tenuta dell’Ornellaia)
 Percarlo — 100 percent Sangiovese (San Giusto a Rentennano)
 Le Pergole Torte — entirely Sangiovese (Montevertine)
 Prunaio — mainly Sangiovese (Viticcio)
 Sammarco — 80 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Sangiovese
(Castello dei Rampolla)
 Sassicaia — 75 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 25 percent Cabernet Franc
(Tenuta San Guido)
 I Sodi di San Niccolò — mostly Sangiovese (Castellare di Castellina)
 Solaia — 80 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Sangiovese
(Antinori)
 Tignanello — 80 percent Sangiovese, 20 percent Cabernet Sauvignon
(Antinori)

Sangiovese at the table
Lighter Chianti wines go well with pasta, pro-
sciutto, and roast chicken or squab. With
Chianti Classicos and riservas, lamb, roast
turkey, veal, steak, and roast beef are fine
accompaniments. For the robust Brunello di
Montalcino and super-Tuscan wines, try pheas-
ant, steak, game, or chunks of fresh Parmesan
cheese. Serve these wines at cool room tem-
perature, 62° to 66° F (16° to19° C).

Decant young (less than ten years old) super-Tuscan wines two or three
hours before serving. (For a more complete listing of super-Tuscan wines, see
Chapter 8 in Italian Wine For Dummies.)
Tre Venezie
The three regions in the northeastern corner of Italy (refer to Figure 10-1) are
often referred to as the Tre Venezie — the Three Venices — because they
were once part of the Venetian Empire. Colorful historical associations aside,
each of these regions produces red and white wines that are among the most
popular Italian wines outside of Italy — as well as at home.
Three gentle wines from Verona
Chances are that if your first dry Italian wine wasn’t Chianti or Pinot Grigio, it
was one of Verona’s big three: the white Soave (so AH vay) or the reds,
Valpolicella (val po lee CHEL lah) or Bardolino (bar do LEE noh). These enor-
mously popular wines hail from Northeast Italy, around the picturesque city
of Verona — Romeo and Juliet’s hometown — and the beautiful Lake Garda.
Of Verona’s two reds, Valpolicella has more body. (Bolla and Masi are two of
the largest producers.) The lighter Bardolino is a pleasant summer wine
when served slightly cool. Soave can be a fairly neutral-tasting unoaked
white or a characterful wine with fruity and nutty flavor, depending on the
producer.
Most Valpolicella, Bardolino, and Soave wines are priced from $9 to $14, as
are two other white wines of the region, Bianco di Custoza and Lugana. Some
of the better Veronese wines, from the following recommended producers,
have slightly higher prices:
 Soave: Pieropan, Inama, Gini, Santa Sofia
 Valpolicella: Allegrini, Quintarelli, Dal Forno, Le Ragose, Bertani,
Alighieri, Tommasi, Masi
 Bardolino: Guerrieri-Rizzardi, Cavalchina, Fratelli Zeni
Amarone della Valpolicella (also simply known as Amarone), one of Italy’s
most full-bodied red wines, is a variant of Valpolicella. It’s made from the
same grape varieties (refer to Table 10-1), but the ripe grapes dry on mats
for several months before fermentation, thus concentrating their sugar and
flavors. The resulting wine is a rich, potent (14 to 16 percent alcohol), long-
182
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

lasting wine, perfect for a cold winter night and a plate of mature cheeses.
Some of the best producers of Amarone are Quintarelli, Bertani, Masi,
Tommasi, Le Ragose, Allegrini, and Dal Forno.
The Austrian-Italian alliance
If you have traveled much in Italy, you probably realize that in spirit Italy is not
one unified country but 20 or more different countries linked together politi-
cally. Consider Trentino-Alto Adige. Not only is this mountainous region (the
northernmost in Italy; refer to Figure 10-1) dramatically different from the rest
of Italy, but also the mainly German-speaking Alto Adige (or South Tyrol) in the
north is completely different from the Italian-speaking Trentino in the south.
(Before World War I, the South Tyrol was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.)
The wines of the two areas are different, too — yet the area is considered a
single region!
Alto Adige produces red wine, but most of it goes to Germany, Austria, and
Switzerland. The rest of the world sees Alto Adige’s white wines — Pinot
Grigio, Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Sauvignon, and Gewürztraminer —
which are priced mainly in the $12 to $18 range.
One local red wine to seek out is Alto Adige’s Lagrein, from a native grape
variety of the same name. It’s a robust, hearty wine, somewhat spicy and
rustic in style, but it offers a completely unique taste experience. Hofstätter
and Alois Lageder are two producers who make a particularly good Lagrein.
183
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino
Pinot Grigio, marketing miracle
Pinot Grigio — the biggest-selling imported
wine in the United States — is produced in all
three of the Tre Venezie regions. The Cavit
brand 
leads 
the 
way, 
but 
Folonari,
MezzaCorona, and Santa Margherita all do very
well in sales. Santa Margherita, in particular,
was the first brand to establish itself solidly on
the American market, and it still sells extremely
well in restaurants. You could say that Pinot
Grigio is the new Chardonnay.
Some people theorize that the musical name is
part of the wine’s success — that U.S. wine
drinkers like to say, “Pinot Grigio,” just as they
once liked to say “Pouilly-Fuissé.” But obviously
people also like the taste of Pinot Grigio. It’s fairly
light-bodied, with crisp acidity and fairly neutral
aromas and flavors — an easy-drinking wine
that goes well with most foods. Pinot Grigio is so
successful, in fact, that many California wineries
are growing the Pinot Gris grape and using the
Italian name, Pinot Grigio, on their wine labels.
The Californian versions tend to be fruitier, fuller-
bodied and sometimes ever so slightly sweet
compared to the Italian wines.

Alto Adige produces Italy’s best white wines, along with nearby Friuli. Four
producers to look for are Alois Lageder, Hofstätter, Tiefenbrunner, and Peter
Zemmer. Here are some highlights of each brand:
 Lageder’s Pinot Bianco from the Haberlehof vineyard and his Sauvignon
from the Lehenhof vineyard are exceptional examples of their grape 
varieties and are among the best wines from these two varieties that
we’ve tasted.
 Hofstätter’s Gewürztraminer, from the Kolbenhof vineyard, is as fine a
wine as you can find from this tricky grape variety. Hofstätter also makes
one of Italy’s best Pinot Nero wines, Villa Barthenau.
 Tiefenbrunner’s Müller Thurgau (MOOL lair TOOR gow) from his
Feldmarschall Vineyard (the region’s highest in altitude) could well be
the wine world’s best wine from this otherwise lackluster variety.
 Peter Zemmer produces reliable Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio wines in
the $11 to $14 price range.
Trentino, the southern part of the Trentino-Alto Adige region, is not without
its own notable wines. Some excellent Chardonnay wines come from
Trentino, for example; two of the best are made by Pojer & Sandri and
Roberto Zeni. (In fact, we recommend any of the wines from these two pro-
ducers.) Elisabetta Foradori is a Trentino producer who specializes in red
wines made from the local variety, Teroldego (teh ROLL day go) Rotaliano.
Her best red wines, Granato and Sgarzon, are based on Teroldego and always
get rave reviews from wine critics. Also, one of Italy’s leading sparkling wine
producers, Ferrari, is in Trentino. (See Chapter 14 for more information on
sparkling wine producers.)
The far side: Friuli-Venezia Giulia
Italy has justifiably been known in the wine world for its red wines. But in the
past 20 years, the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (refer to Figure 10-1), led by
the pioneering winemaker, the late Mario Schiopetto, has made the world
conscious of Italy’s white wines as well.
Near the region’s eastern border with Slovenia, the districts of Collio and
Colli Orientali del Friuli produce Friuli’s best wines. Red wines exist here, but
the white wines have given these zones their renown. In addition to Pinot
Grigio, Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon, two local favorites are
Tocai Friulano and Ribolla Gialla (both fairly rich, full, and viscous).
A truly great white wine made here is Silvio Jermann’s Vintage Tunina, a
blend of five varieties, including Pinot Bianco, Sauvignon, and Chardonnay.
Vintage Tunina is a rich, full-bodied, long-lived white of world-class status. It
sells in the $35 to $45 range and, frankly, it’s worth the money. Give the wine
about ten years to age and then try it with rich poultry dishes or pasta.

Snapshots from the Rest of Italy
Italy’s wines are by no means confined to the five regions that we discuss indi-
vidually. A quick tour of some of Italy’s other regions proves the point. (For
more complete info on the wines of Italy’s other regions, see Italian Wine For
Dummies.) Refer to Figure 10-1 for the location of each of the following regions:
 Lombardy: In the northern part of this northerly region, near the Swiss
border, the Valtellina wine district produces four relatively light-bodied
red wines from the Nebbiolo grape: Sassella, Inferno, Grumello, and
Valgella. Most of these wines are inexpensive (about $10 to $20) and,
unlike Barolo or Barbaresco, can be enjoyed young. Lombardy is also
the home of Italy’s best sparkling wine district, Franciacorta. (See
Chapter 14 for more on Franciacorta and Italy’s other sparkling wines.)
 Emilia-Romagna: This is the home of Lambrusco, one of Italy’s most suc-
cessful wines on export markets. For a different Lambrusco experience,
try a dry one if you can find it. (You may have to go to Emilia-Romagna
for that — but, hey, that’s not so bad. Bologna and Parma, two gastro-
nomic meccas, are in this region.)
 Liguria: This narrow region south of Piedmont, along the Italian Riviera,
is also the home of Cinque Terre, one of Italy’s most picturesque areas.
The region’s two fine white wines, Vermentino and Pigato, are just made
for Liguria’s pasta with pesto, its signature dish.
 Marches (also known as Marche): Verdicchio is a dry, inexpensive white
wine that goes well with fish, is widely available, and improves in quality
with every vintage. Try the Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi from Fazi-
Battaglia, Colonnara, or Umani Ronchi, great values at $9 to $12.
Marche’s best red wine, Rosso Cònero, at $15 to $22, is one of Italy’s fine
red wine buys.
185
Chapter 10: Italy, the Heartland of Vino

 Umbria: This region, home to the towns of Perugia and Assisi, makes
some good reds and whites. Orvieto, a white, is widely available for
around $11 from Tuscan producers such as Antinori and Ruffino. Two
interesting red wines are Torgiano, a Chianti-like blend (try Lungarotti’s
Rubesco Riserva DOCG), and Sagrantino di Montefalco DOCG, a medium-
bodied, characterful wine made from the local Sagrantino grape.
 Latium: This region around Rome makes the ubiquitous, inexpensive
Frascati, a light, neutral wine from the Trebbiano grape; Fontana
Candida is a popular brand.
 Abruzzo: Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, an inexpensive, easy-drinking, low
tannin, low-acid red wine, comes from here; it’s a terrific everyday red,
especially from a quality producer such as Masciarelli. Abruzzo is also
home to two other fine producers, Cataldi Madonna and the late, great
Eduardo Valentini, whose sought-after Trebbiano d’Abruzzo is perhaps the
world’s greatest white wine from the otherwise ordinary Trebbiano grape.
 Campania: Some of the best wines in Southern Italy are produced here,
around Naples. The full-bodied, tannic Taurasi, a DOCG wine from the
Aglianico grape, is one of the great, long-lived red wines in Italy.
Premium producers are Mastroberardino (look for his single-vineyard
Taurasi, called Radici), Feudi di San Gregorio, and Terredora. The same
producers also make two unique whites, Greco di Tufo and Fiano di
Avellino. They’re full-flavored, viscous wines with great aging capacity
that sell in the $18 to $25 range. Falanghina ($12 to $16) is another excit-
ing, light-bodied white Campania wine.
 Basilicata: The instep of the Italian boot, Basilicata has one important
red wine, Aglianico del Vulture. It’s similar to Taurasi, but not quite so
intense and full-bodied. D’Angelo and Paternoster are leading producers.
 Apulia: This region makes more wine than any other in Italy. Generally, it
is inexpensive, full-bodied red wine, such as Salice Salentino (from the
native variety, Negroamaro) and Primitivo.
 Sicily: Once known only for its Marsala, a sweet, fortified wine, Sicily is
now making quality reds and whites. Established wineries such as Corvo
(a.k.a. Duca di Salaparuta) and Regaleali have been joined by exciting,
new wineries such as Planeta, Morgante, Donnafugata, and Benanti to
produce some of Italy’s more intriguing wines — especially reds, many
made from Sicily’s superb variety, Nero d’Avola.
 Sardinia: This large island off the eastern coast of Italy makes delicate
white wines and characterful reds from native grape varieties and from
international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Sella & Mosca,
Argiolas, and Santadi are three leading producers. Two of the more popu-
lar Sardinian wines are the white Vermentino and the red Cannonau (the
local version of Grenache), both of which sell in the $11 to $16 range.

I
n the past, no one ever used the phrase European wine when talking 
generally about the wines of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Germany.
The wines had nothing in common.
But today, two factors have changed the way we look at the wines of these
countries. First, Europe has unified, and the wines of the European Union
member countries now share a common legislative umbrella. Second, 
non-European wines — from California, Australia, Chile, and South America —
have inundated the U.S. market, popularizing a nomenclature (varietal names,
such as Chardonnay) and flavors (fruity, fruitier, fruitiest) foreign to the
European, or Old World, model.
When we compare Europe’s wines to non-European, or New World, wines, we
notice that the diverse wines of Europe have many things in common after all.
Most European wines are usually named for their place of production instead
of their grape (see Chapter 4); European winemaking is tethered to tradition
and regulations; the wines for the most part have local flavor rather than con-
forming to an international concept of how wine should taste (although, sadly,
we’re seeing an emerging “internationalization” of wine styles); and these
wines are relatively low in fruitiness. European wines tend to embody the tra-
ditions of the people who make them and the flavors of the place where their
vines grow, unlike New World wines, which tend to embody grape variety and
a general fruitiness of flavor.

Despite these similarities among European wines, the countries of Europe
each make distinctly different wines. The importance of France and Italy has
earned each of these countries a whole chapter, while the rest of Europe
shares the spotlight here.
Intriguing Wines from Old Spain
Spain is a hot, dry, mountainous country with more vineyard land than any
other nation on earth. It ranks third in the world in wine production, after
France and Italy.
Spanish wine has awakened from a long period of dormancy and under-
achievement. Spain is now one of the wine world’s most vibrant arenas.
For decades, only Spain’s most famous red wine region, Rioja (ree OH ha),
and the classic fortified wine region, Sherry, had any international presence
for fine wines. (For more on Sherry, see Chapter 15.) Now, many other wine
regions in Spain are making seriously good wines. Besides Rioja, the following
regions are an important part of the wine quality picture in Spain today, and
their wines are generally available (see Figure 11-1):
 Ribera del Duero (ree BEAR ah dell DWAIR oh), now famous for its high
quality red wines, has helped to ignite world interest in Spanish wines.
 Priorato (pree or AH toe), mountainous and inaccessible, and one of the
world’s hot new regions for red wine, is north of the city of Tarragona, in
northeast Spain.
 Penedés (pen eh DAIS) is a large producer of both red and white wines,
as well as being famous for its sparkling wines (known as Cava; see
Chapter 14).
 The Rías Baixas (REE ahse BYCHE ahse) region of Galicia (gah LEETH
ee ah) is gaining acclaim for its exciting white wine, Albariño.
 Navarra (nah VAR rah), an area long known for its dry rosé wines, is an
increasingly strong red wine region.
 Toro is quickly emerging as one of Spain’s best red wine regions.
 Rueda (ru AE dah) is known for well-made, inexpensive white wines.
Spain’s wine laws, like Italy’s, provide for a bi-level QWPSR category:
Denominaciónes de Origen (DO) and a higher classification, Denominaciónes de
Origen Calificada (DOC), the latter created in 1991. So far, Rioja and Priorato
are the only two regions that have been awarded the DOC (also known as
DOCa). Wines that do not qualify as DO fall into the table wine category Vino
de la Tierra (equivalent to the French Vins de Pays). See Chapter 4 for more
about appellation systems.

Rioja rules the roost
Rioja, in north-central Spain (see Figure 11-1), has historically been the coun-
try’s major red wine region (even if today Ribera del Duero and Priorato are
catching up — fast!). Three-quarters of Rioja’s wine is red, 15 percent rosado
(rosé), and 10 percent white.
The principal grape in Rioja is Tempranillo (tem prah NEE yoh), Spain’s greatest
red variety. But regulations permit another three varieties for reds — Garnacha
(Grenache), Graciano (Carignan), and Mazuelo — and red Rioja wine is typically
a blend of two or more varieties. Regulations aside, some producers now also
use Cabernet Sauvignon in their red Rioja.
The Rioja region has three districts: the cooler, Atlantic-influenced Rioja
Alavesa and Rioja Alta areas and the warmer Rioja Baja zone. Most of the best
Riojas are made from grapes in the two cooler districts, but some Riojas are
blended from grapes of all three districts.

Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Traditional production for red Rioja wine involved many years of aging in
small barrels of American oak before release, which created pale, gentle,
sometimes tired (but lovely) wines that lacked fruitiness. The trend has been
to replace some of the oak aging with bottle aging, resulting in wines that
taste much fresher. Another trend, among more progressive winemakers, is to
use barrels made of French oak along with barrels of American oak — which
has traditionally given Rioja its characteristic vanilla aroma. (See Chapter 5
for a discussion of oak barrels.)
Regardless of style, red Rioja wines have several faces according to how long
they age before being released from the winery. Some wines receive no oak
aging at all and are released young. Some wines age (in oak and in bottle) for
two years at the winery and are labeled crianza; these wines are still fresh
and fruity in style. Other wines age for three years and carry the designation
reserva. The finest wines age for five years or longer, earning the status of
gran reserva. These terms appear on the labels — if not on the front label,
then on a rear label which is the seal of authenticity for Rioja wines.
Prices start at around $12 for crianza reds and go up to about $45 for some
gran reservas. The best recent vintages for Rioja are 2004, 2001, 1995, 1994,
1989, 1982, and 1981.
The following Rioja producers are particularly consistent in quality for their
red wines:
 CVNE (Compañía Vinícola del Norte de España), commonly referred to
as CUNE (COO nay)
 Bodegas Muga
 R. Lopez de Heredia
 La Rioja Alta
 Marqués de Murrieta Ygay
 Marqués de Riscal
Most white Riojas these days are merely fresh, neutral, inoffensive wines, but
Marqués de Murrieta and R. Lopez de Heredia still make a traditional white
Rioja, golden-colored and oak-aged, from a blend of local white grape vari-
eties, predominantly Viura. We find both of these traditional whites fascinat-
ing: flavorful, voluptuous, with attractive traces of oxidation, and capable of
aging. They’re not everybody’s cup of tea, true, but the wines sure have char-
acter! They have so much presence that they can accompany foods normally
associated with red wine, as well as traditional Spanish food, such as paella
or seafood. The Murrieta white sells for about $16, and the Lopez de Heredia
is about $20.

Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Ribera del Duero challenges
Ribera del Duero, two hours north of Madrid by auto, is one of Spain’s most
dynamic wine regions. Perhaps nowhere else in the world does the Tempranillo
grape variety reach such heights, making wines with body, deep color, and
finesse. For many years, one producer, the legendary Vega Sicilia, dominated
the Ribera del Duero area. In fact, Spain’s single most famous great wine is
Vega Sicilia’s Unico (Tempranillo, with 20 percent Cabernet Sauvignon) — an
intense, concentrated, tannic red wine with enormous longevity; it ages for
ten years in casks and then sometimes ages further in the bottle before it’s
released. Unico is available mainly in top Spanish restaurants; if you’re lucky
enough to find it in a retail shop, it can cost about $300 — a bottle, that is.
Even Unico’s younger, less intense, and more available sibling, the Vega Sicilia
Valbuena, retails for about $100.
Vega Sicilia is no longer the only renowned red wine in Ribera del Duero.
Alejandro Fernández’s Pesquera, entirely Tempranillo, has earned high praise
over the past 15 years. Pesquera is a big, rich, oaky, tannic wine with intense
fruit character. The reserva sells for about $28, while the younger Pesquera is
$20. The reserva of Fernández’s other winery in the area, Condado de Haza,
sells for about $35. Three other fine producers of Ribera del Duero are Bodegas
Mauro, Viña Pedrosa, and Bodegas Téofilo Reyes, who all make red wines
that rival Pesquera.
Priorato: Emerging from the past
Back in the twelfth century, monks founded a monastery (or “priory”) in the
harsh, inaccessible Sierra de Montsant Mountains, about 100 miles southwest
of Barcelona in the Catalonia region, and planted vines on the steep hillsides.
As time passed, the monastery closed, and the vineyards were abandoned
because life was simply too difficult in this area (which in time became
known as Priorat, or Priorato).
Cut to the twentieth century — in fact about 25 short years ago. Enterprising
winemakers, among them Alvaro Palacios, rediscovered the area and decided
that conditions are ideal for making powerful red wines, especially from old
vines planted by locals early in the twentieth century.
No Spanish wine region has been in the spotlight lately more than Priorato.
And yet Priorato hasn’t become a tourist destination, because it’s so inacces-
sible. The region’s volcanic soil, composed mainly of slate and schist, is so
infertile that not much other than grapes can grow there. The climate is harshly
continental: very hot, dry summers and very cold winters. The steep slopes
must be terraced; many vineyards can be worked only by hand. And grape
yields are very low.
191
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Amazingly rich, powerful red wines — made primarily from Garnacha and
Carignan, two of Spain’s native varieties — have emerged from this harsh
landscape. Many are as rugged as the land, with high tannin and alcohol;
some wines are so high in alcohol that they have an almost Port-like sweet-
ness. Because winemaking in Priorato isn’t cost-effective, to say the least, and
the quantities of each wine are so small, the wines are necessarily quite
expensive; prices begin at about $40.
Priorat reds to look for include Clos Mogador, Clos Erasmus, Alvaro Palacios,
Clos Martinet, l’Hermita, Morlanda, Mas d’En Gil, and Pasanau.
Five other Spanish regions to watch
The action in Spanish wines — especially when value is your concern — 
definitely doesn’t end with Rioja, Ribera del Duero, and Priorato.
Penedés
The Penedés wine region is in Catalonia, south of Barcelona (refer to
Figure 11-1). It’s the home of most Spanish sparkling wines, known as Cava,
which we discuss in Chapter 14.
Any discussion of Penedés’ still wines must begin with Torres, one of the
world’s great family-owned wineries. Around 1970, Miguel Torres pioneered
the making of wines in Spain from French varieties, such as Cabernet
Sauvignon and Chardonnay, along with local grapes, such as Tempranillo
and Garnacha.
All the Torres wines are clean, well made, reasonably priced, and
widely available. They start in the $10 range for the red Sangre de Toro
(Garnacha–Carignan) and Coronas (Tempranillo–Cabernet Sauvignon) and
the white Viña Sol. The top-of-the-line Mas La Plana Black Label, a powerful
yet elegant Cabernet Sauvignon, costs about $45.
Freixenet, the leading Cava producer, is now also in the still wine business.
Its wines include the inexpensive René Barbier brand varietals and two fasci-
nating wines from Segura Viudas (a Cava brand owned by Freixenet), both
$15 to $16. Creu de Lavit is a subtle but complex white that’s all Xarel-lo 
(pronounced sha REL lo), a native grape used mainly for Cava production.
The red Mas d’Aranyo is mainly Tempranillo. We particularly recommend
Creu de Lavit.
192
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Rías Baixas: The white wine from Galicia
Galicia, in northwest Spain next to the Atlantic Ocean and Portugal (refer to
Figure 11-1), was not a province known for its wine. But from a small area
called Rías Baixas (REE ahse BYCHE ahse), tucked away in the southern part
of Galicia, an exciting, new white wine has emerged — Albariño, made from
the Albariño grape variety. Rías Baixas is, in fact, one of the world’s hottest
white wine regions. We use “hot” to mean “in demand,” not to describe the
climate, because Rías Baixas is cool and damp a good part of the year, and
verdant year-round.
This region now boasts about 200 wineries, compared to only 60 just a decade
ago. Modern winemaking, the cool climate, and low-yielding vines have com-
bined to make Albariño wines a huge success, especially in the United States,
its leading market. We love this lively, (mainly) unoaked white, with its vivid,
floral aromas and flavors reminiscent of apricots, white peaches, pears, and
green apples. It’s a perfect match with seafood and fish. The Albariño grape —
known as Alvarinho in northern Portugal (south of Rías Baixas) — makes
wines that are fairly high in acidity, which makes them fine apéritif wines.
Albariños to look for include Bodega Morgadío, Lusco, Bodegas Martin Codax,
Fillaboa, Pazo de Señorans, Pazo San Mauro, Pazo de Barrantes, and Vionta;
all are in the $16 to $23 range.
193
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond
Decoding Spanish wine labels
You see some of the following terms on a
Spanish wine label:
Blanco: White
Bodega: Winery
Cosecha (coh SAY cha) or Vendimia (ven DEE
me yah): The vintage year
Crianza (cree AHN zah): For red wines, this
means that the wine has aged for two years
with at least six months in oak; for white and
rosé wines, crianza means that the wines aged
for a year with at least six months in oak. (Some
regions have stricter standards.)
Gran reserva: Wines produced only in excep-
tional vintages; red wines must age at least five
years, including a minimum of two years in oak;
white gran reservas must age at least four years
before release, including six months in oak.
Reserva: Wines produced in the better vintages;
red reservas must age a minimum of three
years, including one year in oak; white reservas
must age for two years, including six months
in oak.
Tinto (TEEN toe): Red

Navarra
Once upon a time, the word Navarra conjured up images of inexpensive, easy-
drinking dry rosé wines (or, to the more adventurous, memories of running
the bulls in Pamplona, Navarra’s capital city). Today, Navarra, just northeast
of Rioja, is known for its red wines, which are similar to, but somewhat less
expensive than, the more famous wines of Rioja.
Many Navarra reds rely on Tempranillo, along with Garnacha, but you can
also find Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and various blends of all four varieties
in the innovative Navarra region. Look for the wines of the following three
Navarra producers: Bodegas Julian Chivite (HOO lee ahn cha VEE tay),
Bodegas Guelbenzu (gwel ben ZOO), and Bodegas Magana.
El Toro
The Toro region in northwest Spain, west of Ribera del Duero, made wines
in the Middle Ages that were quite famous in Spain. But it’s a hot, arid area
with poor soil, so winemaking was practically abandoned there for centuries.
In Spain’s current wine boom, Toro has been rediscovered. Winemakers
have determined that the climate and soil are actually ideal for making pow-
erful, tannic red wines — mainly from the Tempranillo variety — which rival
the wines of Toro’s neighbors in Ribera del Duero. Toro producers to buy
include Bodegas Fariña, Vega Sauco, Estancia Piedra, Bodegas y Viñas Dos
Victorias, Gil Luna, and Dehesa La Granja (owned by Pesquera’s Alejandro
Fernandez).
The Verdejo from Rueda
The Rueda region, west of Ribera del Duero, produces one of Spain’s best
white wines from the Verdejo grape. The wine is clean and fresh, has good
fruit character, and sells for an affordable $9 to $10. The Rioja producer
Marquis de Riscal makes one of the leading and most available examples.
Portugal: More Than Just Port
Portugal is justifiably famous for its great dessert wine, Port (which we discuss
in Chapter 15). But gradually, wine lovers are discovering the other dimensions
of Portuguese wine — its dry wines, especially its reds. Most of these wines
come from native Portuguese grape varieties, of which the country has hun-
dreds. We expect Portugal’s well-priced wines to play a larger role in world
wine markets in the twenty-first century.
194
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Portugal’s highest rank for wines is Denominação de Origen (DO), which has
been awarded to the wines of 32 regions. The table wine category includes
eight Vinho Regional (VR) regions, equivalent to France’s Vin de Pays, and the
simple Vinho de Mesa (table wines).
Portugal’s “green” white
On hot summer evenings, the most appropriate wine can be a bottle of bracing,
slightly effervescent, white Vinho Verde (VEEN yo VAIRD). The high acidity of
Vinho Verde refreshes your mouth and particularly complements grilled fish
or seafood.
The Minho region, Vinho Verde’s home, is in the northwest corner of
Portugal, directly across the border from the Rías Baixas wine region of
Spain. (The region is particularly verdant because of the rain from the
Atlantic Ocean — one theory behind the wine’s name.)
Two styles of white Vinho Verde exist on the market. The most commonly
found brands (Aveleda and Casal Garcia), which sell for $7 or $8, are medium-
dry wines of average quality that are best served cold.
The more expensive Vinho Verdes ($15 to $20) are varietal wines made from
either the Alvarinho grape (Rías Baixas’s Albariño), Loureiro, or Trajadura.
They’re more complex, dryer, and more concentrated than basic Vinho
Verde, and are Portugal’s best whites. Unfortunately, these finer wines are
more difficult to find than the inexpensive ones; look for them in better
wine shops or in Portuguese neighborhoods — or on your next trip to
Portugal!
The majority of wines from Vinho Verde are red. However, these wines are
highly acidic; you definitely need to acquire a taste for them. (We haven’t
acquired it yet!)
Noteworthy Portuguese red wines
Possibly the best dry red wine in Portugal, Barca Velha, comes from the
Douro region, where the grapes for Port (officially known as Porto) grow.
Made by the Ferreira Port house, Barca Velha is a full-bodied, intense, con-
centrated wine that needs years to age — Portugal’s version of Vega Sicilia’s
Unico, but at a considerably lower price ($65 to $70). Like Unico, not much is
made, and it’s produced only in the best vintages.
195
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Fortunately, the Port house of Ramos Pinto (now owned by Roederer
Champagne) makes inexpensive, top-quality, dry red Douro wines that are
readily available. Duas Quintas (about $12) has ripe, plummy flavors and a
velvety texture; it’s surprisingly rich but supple, and it’s a great value.
The Douro region boasts other terrific dry red wines, most of them fairly new
and based on grapes traditionally used for Port. Brands to look for include
Quinta do Vale D. Maria, Quinta do Vallado, Quinta do Crasto, Quinta do
Cotto, Quinta de la Rosa, Quinta do Vale Meão, Quinta de Roriz, Quinta da
Leda Vale do Bomfim and Chryseia.
Other good red Portuguese wines to try include
 Quinta do Carmo: The majority owner of this estate in the dynamic
Alentejo region in southern Portugal is Château Lafite-Rothschild. A rich,
full-bodied wine, it sells for $25. Don Martinho, a second-label wine from
the estate, is less than half the price of Quinta do Carmo.
 Quinta de Pancas: One of the few Cabernet Sauvignons in Portugal,
Quinta de Pancas comes from the Alenquer region, north of Lisbon;
it sells for about $15.
 Quinta de Parrotes: Made from the local Castelão Frances grape variety,
Quinta de Parrotes, from the same estate in Alenquer as the Quinta de
Pancas, is a steal at $10.
 Quinta da Bacalhôa: An estate-bottled Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
from the esteemed Portuguese winemaker Joào Pires in Azeitao 
(south of Lisbon), Bacalhôa has the elegance of a Bordeaux; it sells
for $27.
196
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
Recognizing Portuguese wine terms
The following terms may appear on Portuguese
wine labels:
Colheita (col YAY tah): Vintage year
Garrafeira (gar rah FAY rah): A reserva that has
aged at least two years in a cask and one in a
bottle if it’s red; six months in a cask, six months
in a bottle if it’s white
Quinta (KEEN ta): Estate or vineyard
Reserva: A wine of superior quality from one
vintage
Tinto (TEEN toe): Red

 The red wines of J.M. da Fonseca Successores (no relation to the
Fonseca Port house): This firm is producing some of the best red
wines in Portugal. Look for Quinta da Camarate, Morgado do Reguengo,
Tinto Velho Rosado Fernandes, and all da Fonseca’s Garrafeiras.
 The wines of Joao Portugal Ramos: A tireless winemaker who consults
for various wineries and also owns three properties, Ramos has a golden
touch and yet maintains the typicity of his wines. Some wines sell under
his own name; others are Marquês de Borba and Vila Santa.
Germany: Europe’s Individualist
German wines march to the beat of a different drummer. They come in mainly
one color: white. They’re fruity in style, low in alcohol, rarely oaked, and
often off-dry or sweet. Their labels carry grape names, which is an anomaly
in Europe.
Germany is the northernmost major wine-producing country in Europe —
which means that its climate is cool. Except in warmer pockets of Germany,
red grapes don’t ripen adequately, which is the reason most German wines
are white. The climate is also erratic from year to year, meaning that vintages
do matter for fine German wines. Germany’s finest vineyards are situated
along rivers such as the Rhine and the Mosel, and on steep, sunny slopes,
to temper the extremes of the weather and help the grapes ripen.
Riesling and its cohorts
In Germany’s cool climate, the noble Riesling (REESE ling) grape finds true
happiness. Riesling represents little more than 20 percent of Germany’s vine-
yard plantings.
Another major, but less distinguished, German variety is Müller-Thurgau
(pronounced MOOL lair TOOR gow), a crossing between the Riesling and
Silvaner (or possibly Chasselas) grapes. Its wines are softer than Riesling’s
with less character and little potential for greatness.
After Müller-Thurgau and Riesling, the most-planted grapes in Germany
are Silvaner, Kerner, Scheurebe (SHOY reb beh), and Ruländer (Pinot Gris).
Among Germany’s red grapes, Spätburgunder (Pinot Noir) is the most widely
planted, mainly in the warmer parts of the country.
197
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Germany’s wine laws and wine styles
Germany’s classification system is not based on the French AOC system, as
those of most other European countries are. Like most European wines,
German wines are in fact named after the places they come from — in the
best wines, usually a combination of a village name and a vineyard name,
such as Piesporter (town) Goldtröpfchen (vineyard).
Unlike most European wines, however, the grape name is also usually part of
the wine name (as in Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Riesling). And the finest German
wines have yet another element in their name — a Prädikat (PRAY di cat), which
is an indication of the ripeness of the grapes at harvest (as in Piesporter
Goldtröpfchen Riesling Spätlese). Wines with a Prädikat hold the highest rank
in the German wine system.
Germany’s system of assigning the highest rank to the ripest grapes is com-
pletely different from the concept behind most other European systems,
which is to bestow the highest status on the best vineyards or districts.
Germany’s system underscores the country’s grape-growing priority:
Ripeness — never guaranteed in a cool climate — is the highest goal.
German wine law divides wines with a Prädikat into six levels. From the least
ripe to the ripest (that is, from the lowest to the highest), they are
 Kabinett (KAB ee net)
 Spätlese (SHPATE lay seh)
 Auslese (OUSE lay seh)
 Beerenauslese (BEER en OUSE lay seh), abbreviated as BA
 Eiswein (ICE vine)
 Trockenbeerenauslese (TROH ken BEER enOUSE lay seh), abbreviated
as TBA
At the three highest Prädikat levels, the amount of sugar in the grapes is so
high that the wines are inevitably sweet. Many people, therefore, mistakenly
believe that the Prädikat level of a German wine is an indication of the wine’s
sweetness. In fact, the Prädikat is an indication of the amount of sugar in the
grapes at harvest, not the amount of sugar in the wine. At lower Prädikat
levels, the sugar in the grapes can ferment fully, to dryness, and for those
wines there is no direct correlation between Prädikat level and sweetness of
the wine.
198
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Wines whose (grape) ripeness earns them a Prädikat are categorized as QmP
wines (Qualitätswein mit Prädikat), translated as quality wines with special
attributes (their ripeness). They are QWPSR wines in the eyes of the EU
(see Chapter 4). When the ripeness of the grapes in a particular vineyard is
not sufficient to earn the wine a Prädikat name, the wine can still qualify as
a “quality wine” in Germany’s second QWPSR tier, called QbA (Qualitätswein
bestimmter Anbaugebiet), translated as quality wine from a special region.
(Refer to the section, “Germany’s wine regions,” for the names of the main
regions.) Often just the term Qualitätswein appears on labels of QbA wines,
without the words bestimmter Anbaugebiet — and the name of the region will
always appear. 
Less than 10 percent of Germany’s wine production falls into the lower,
table wine categories Landwein (table wines with geographic indication) or
Deutscher Tafelwein. Most of the inexpensive German wines that you see in
wine shops are QbA wines.
Dry, half-dry, or gentle
The common perception of German wines is that they are all sweet. Yet many
German wines taste dry, or fairly dry. In fact, you can find German wines at
just about any sweetness or dryness level you like.
Most inexpensive German wines, such as Liebfraumilch, are light-bodied,
fruity wines with pleasant sweetness — wines that are easy to enjoy without
food. The German term for this style of wine is lieblich, which translates as
“gentle” — a poetic but apt descriptor. The very driest German wines are
called trocken (dry). Wines that are sweeter than trocken but dryer than
lieblich are called halbtrocken (half-dry). The words trocken and halbtrocken
sometimes appear on the label, but not always.
You can make a good stab at determining how sweet a German wine is by
reading the alcohol level on the label. If the alcohol is low — about nine per-
cent, or less — the wine probably contains grape sugar that didn’t ferment
into alcohol and is therefore sweet. Higher alcohol levels suggest that the
grapes fermented completely, to dryness.
Although we generally prefer dry white wines, we find that a bit of sweetness
in German wines can be appealing — and in fact can improve the quality of
the wine. That’s because sweetness undercuts the wines’ natural high acidity
and gives the wines better balance. In truth, most off-dry German wines don’t
really taste as sweet as they are, thanks to their acidity.
199
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

One way that German winemakers keep some sweetness in their wines is
called the süssreserve (sweet reserve) method. In this method, a winemaker
holds back as much as 25 percent of his grape juice and doesn’t allow it to
ferment. He then ferments the rest of his juice fully, until it’s dry wine. Later,
he blends the unfermented grape juice into his dry wine. The grape juice
(the süssreserve) contributes a natural, juicy sweetness to the wine.
What’s noble about rot?
Wine connoisseurs all over the world recognize Germany’s sweet, dessert-
style wines as among the greatest wines on the face of the earth. Most of
these legendary wines owe their sweetness to an ugly but magical fungus
known as botrytis cinerea, pronounced bo TRY tis sin eh RAY ah, commonly
called noble rot.
Noble rot infects ripe grapes in late autumn if a certain combination of humid-
ity and sun is present. This fungus dehydrates the berries and concentrates
their sugar and their flavors. The wine from these infected berries is sweet,
amazingly rich, and complex beyond description. It can also be expensive:
$100 a bottle or more.
Wines at the BA and TBA Prädikat levels are usually made entirely from
grapes infected with noble rot (called botrytised grapes) and are generally
richly textured and sweet. Auslese level wines often come from some partially
botrytised grapes, and when they do, they are likely to be sweet, although
never to the extent of a BA or TBA.
Another way that Nature can contribute exotic sweetness to German wines is
by freezing the grapes on the vine in early winter. When the frozen grapes are
harvested and pressed, most of the water in the berries separates out as ice.
The sweet, concentrated juice that’s left to ferment makes a luscious sweet
Prädikat-level wine called Eiswein (literally, ice wine). Eisweins differ from
BAs and TBAs because they lack a certain flavor that derives from botrytis,
sometimes described as a honeyed character.
Both botrytised wines and Eisweins are referred to as late-harvest wines, not
only in Germany but all over the world, because the special character of
these wines comes from conditions that normally occur only when the
grapes are left on the vine beyond the usual point of harvest.
Germany’s wine regions
Germany has 13 wine regions — 11 in the west and two in the eastern part of
the country (see Figure 11-2).
200
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

The most famous of these 13 are the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region, named for the
Mosel River and two of its tributaries, along which the region’s vineyards lie;
and the Rheingau region, along the Rhine River. The Rhine River lends its
name to three other German wine regions, Rheinhessen, the Pfalz (formerly
called the Rheinpfalz), and the tiny Mittelrhein region.

Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
The Mosel-Saar-Ruwer (MO zel zar ROO ver) is a dramatically beautiful region,
its vineyards rising steeply on the slopes of the twisting and turning Mosel
River. The wines of the region are among the lightest in Germany (usually
containing less than 10 percent alcohol); they’re generally delicate, fresh, and
charming. Riesling dominates the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer with 57 percent of the
plantings. Wines from this region are instantly recognizable because they come
in green bottles rather than the brown bottles that other German regions use.
The Mosel boasts dozens of excellent winemakers who produce really excit-
ing Riesling wines. Some of our favorites include, in alphabetical order:
Egon Müller
Meulenhof
Dr. Fischer
J.J. Prüm
Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium
Reichsgraf Von Kesselstatt
Karlsmühle
Willi Schaefer
Dr. Loosen
Selbach-Oster
Maximin Grünhauser
Zilliken
Merkelbach
Rheingau
The Rheingau (RYNE gow) is among Germany’s smaller wine regions. It, too,
has some dramatically steep vineyards bordering a river, but here the river is
Germany’s greatest wine river, the Rhine. The Riesling grape occupies more
than 80 percent of the Rheingau’s vineyards, many of which are south-facing
slopes that give the Riesling grapes an extra edge of ripeness. Rheingau wine
styles tend toward two extremes: trocken wines on the one hand and sweet
late-harvest wines on the other. Recommended Rheingau producers include
Georg Breuer, Knyphausen, Franz Küntsler, Schloss Schönborn, Leitz, and
Robert Weil.

Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 
A secret code of German place-names
If you don’t speak German and you don’t know
German geography intimately, deciphering
German wine names is tricky, to say the least.
But here’s a bit of information that can help. In
the German language, the possessive is formed
by adding the suffix -er to a noun. When you see
names like Zeller or Hochheimer — names that
end in -er — on a wine label, the next word is
usually a vineyard area that “belongs” to the
commune or district with the -er on its name
(Zell’s Swartze Katz, Hochheim’s Kirchenstück).
The name of the region itself always appears on
labels of QbA and Prädikat wines.

Rheinhessen
Rheinhessen (RYNE hess ehn) is Germany’s largest wine region, producing
huge quantities of simple wines for everyday enjoyment. Liebfraumilch origi-
nated here, and it’s still one of the most important wines of the region, com-
mercially speaking. The Rheinhessen’s highest quality wines come from the
Rheinterrasse, a vineyard area along the river. Producers from that area who
are particularly good include Gunderloch, Heyl Zu Herrnsheim, and Strub.
Pfalz
Almost as big as the Rheinhessen, the Pfalz (fallz) has earned somewhat
more respect from wine lovers for its fairly rich and full-bodied white wines
and its very good reds — all of which owe their style to the region’s relatively
warm climate. Müller-Thurgau, Riesling, Silvaner, and Kerner are among the
most planted grape varieties of the Pfalz, but qualitatively Scheurebe and
Blauburgunder (Pinot Noir) are important. To experience the best of the
Pfalz, look for wines from Dr. Bürklin-Wolf, Rainer Lingenfelder, Müller-Catoir,
and Basserman-Jordan.
Nahe
One other German region of importance for the quality of its wines is Nahe
(NAH heh), named for the Nahe River and situated west of Rheinhessen.
The Riesling wines here are relatively full and intense. Favorite producers
include Diel, Kruger-Rumpf, Prinz zu Salm-Dahlberg, and Dönnhoff.
Switzerland’s Stay-at-Home Wines
Nestled between Germany, France, and Italy, Switzerland is in a perfectly logical
location for growing grapes and making fine wine. Vineyards grace the coun-
try’s three faces — French-speaking, German-speaking, and Italian-speaking.
But few wine lovers outside of Switzerland have much opportunity to taste
Swiss wines because the production is tiny and because the wines are so
popular within Switzerland itself.
About half of Switzerland’s wines are white; most are made from Chasselas —
a grape cultivated with much less distinction in Germany, eastern France, and
the Loire Valley. In Switzerland, Chasselas wines tend to be dry, fairly full-
bodied, and unoaked, with mineral and earthy flavors. Other white grapes
include Pinot Gris, Sylvaner, Marsanne, Petit Arvine, and Amigne — the latter
two indigenous to Switzerland. Merlot is an important red grape (especially
in the Italian-speaking Ticino region), along with Pinot Noir and Gamay.
203
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Because of Switzerland’s varied terrain (hills of varying altitudes, large lakes,
sheltered valleys), numerous microclimates exist. Wine styles therefore vary,
from relatively full-bodied reds and whites to delicate, crisp white wines.
Switzerland’s major wine regions include the Vaud, along Lake Geneva; Valais,
to the east, along the Rhône River; Neuchâtel, in western Switzerland, north
of the Vaud; Ticino, in the south, bordering Italy; and Thurgau in the north,
bordering Germany.
When you do find a bottle of Swiss wine, you may be surprised to discover
how costly it is — $20 to $40 in the United States, reflecting high production
costs. (But quality is generally also high.)
Austria’s Exciting Whites (and Reds)
Austria is one of the wine countries that most excites us. Apart from the gor-
geous vineyard regions, the warmth of the people, and the classic beauty of
Vienna, we love many of the wines. What makes Austrian wines all the more
interesting is how they are evolving, as winemakers gradually discover how
to best express their land and their grapes through wine.
Austria makes less than one percent of all the wine in the world — about
28 million cases a year. All of it comes from the eastern part of the country,
where the Alps recede into hills, and most of it comes from small wineries.
Although some inexpensive Austrian wines do make their way to export mar-
kets, the Austrians have embraced a high-quality image, and most of their
wines therefore command premium prices.
While the excellence of Austria’s sweet whites has long been recognized, her
dry whites and reds have gained recognition only in the past two decades.
Reds are in the minority, claiming about 25 percent of the country’s produc-
tion, because many of Austria’s wine regions are too cool for growing red
grapes. Red wines hail mainly from the area of Burgenland, bordering Hungary,
one of the warmest parts of the country. They’re medium- to full-bodied, often
engagingly spicy, with vivid fruity flavor — and often the international touch
of oaky character. Many of them are based on unusual, native grape varieties
such as the spicy Blaufrankish (Lemberger), the gentler St. Laurent, or Blauer
Zweigelt (a crossing of the other two).
Austria’s white wines — apart from the luscious, late-harvest dessert wines
made from either botrytised, extremely ripe, or dried grapes — are dry wines
ranging from light- to full-bodied that are generally unoaked.
204
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

The country’s single most important grape variety is the native white
Grüner Veltliner. Its wines are full-bodied yet crisp, with rich texture and
herbal or sometimes spicy-vegetal flavors (especially green pepper).
They’re extremely food-friendly, and usually high quality. Some people in
the wine trade have nicknamed Grüner Veltliner “GruVe”; we agree with that
characterization!
Riesling, grown mainly in the region of Lower Austria, in the northeast, is
another key grape for quality whites. In fact, some experts believe that
Austria’s finest wines are its Rieslings (while others prefer Grüner Veltliner).
Other grape names that you may see on bottles of Austrian wine include
Müller-Thurgau, which makes characterful dry whites; Welschriesling, a
grape popular in Eastern Europe for inexpensive wines that achieves high
quality only in Austria; Pinot Blanc, which can excel here; and Muscat.
Sauvignon Blanc is a specialty of the region of Styria, in the south, bordering
Slovenia.
In some parts of Austria, for example in the Wachau district, along the Danube
River, wines are named in the German system — a town name ending in -er
followed by a vineyard name and a grape variety. In other parts of Austria, the
wine names are generally a grape name (or, increasingly, a proprietary name)
followed by the name of the region.
Austria’s wine laws draw from the German model, with QWPSR wine divided
into Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein categories. (One difference is that
Kabinett falls into the Qualitätswein category.) But some people believe that
an appellation system based on terroir rather than ripeness levels would
better express the diversity of Austria’s vineyard regions. Authorities intro-
duced a new system called Districtus Austria Controllatus (DAC) on a limited
basis in early 2003.
The Re-emergence of Hungary
Of all the wine-producing countries in Eastern Europe that broke free from
Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have resumed wine pro-
duction under private winery ownership, Hungary seems to have the greatest
potential. In addition to a winemaking tradition that dates back to pre-Roman
times, Hungary has a wealth of native and international grape varieties and
plenty of land suited to vineyards, with a wide range of climates, soils, and
altitudes.
205
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

The Hungarians are a proud and creative people — or so we concluded on
a trip there when our guide mentioned (more than once) that Hungarians
invented the hologram, the carburetor, contact lenses, and the ballpoint pen,
among other essentials of modern life. Their wine consumption has increased
significantly since the country gained independence, fueling an improvement
in wine quality. International investment in vineyards and wineries has also
made a huge contribution.
Hungary produces the equivalent of about 68 million cases of wine a year,
most of which is white. Although the country is northerly — its capital,
Budapest, sits at the same latitude as Quebec City — its climate is relatively
warm because the country is landlocked and nearly surrounded by moun-
tains. Three large bodies of water do affect the microclimate of certain wine
regions: Lake Neusiedel, between Hungary and Austria in the northwest;
Lake Balaton, Europe’s largest lake, in the center of Hungary’s western half
(which is called Transdanubia); and the Danube River, which runs north to
south right through the middle of the country. Hungary has 22 official wine
regions, but their names are not yet particularly important outside Hungary.
The one Hungarian wine region that does have international fame is Tokaj-
Hegyalja (toe KYE heh JAH yah), which takes its name from the town of Tokaj
and owes its reputation to its world-class dessert wine, Tokaji Azsu (toe KYE
as ZOO). The word Aszu refers to botrytised grapes (described earlier in this
chapter in the section “What’s noble about rot?”). The wine comes from
Furmint and Harslevelu grapes, both native white varieties, and sometimes
Muscat grapes, that have been infected by botrytis. This region also makes
dry table wines, such as the varietal Tokaji Furmint.
Tokaji Azsu wines are labeled as three, four, five, or six Puttonyos, according
to their sweetness, with six Puttonyos wines being the sweetest. (Puttonyos
are baskets used to harvest the botrytised grapes, as well as a measure of
sweetness.) All Tokaji Azsu wines sell in 500 ml bottles, and they range in
price from about $35 to $150 per bottle, depending on their sweetness level.
Tokaji Azsu wines vary not only according to their sweetness, but also
according to their style. Some wines have fresher, more vibrant fruity charac-
ter, for example; some have aromas and flavors that suggest dried fruits;
some have the smoky character and tannin of new oak barrels; and some
have complex non-fruity notes such as tea leaves or chocolate. This range of
styles is due mainly to different winemaking techniques among producers.
Tokaji Azsu has a complicated production method that involves using a 
certain amount of botrytised grapes (which are compressed into a paste of
sorts) as well as healthy, non-moldy grapes; the more moldy grapes that are
used, the sweeter the wine. The production method leaves plenty of room for
individual interpretation. Some of the issues that winemakers differ on —
besides the normal issues of grape blend — include
206
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

 What the botrytised grapes soak in to create the liquid that then ferments
into the final wine: partially-fermented wine or simply juice (in either case,
from non-moldy grapes)
 Whether the wine should mature in new or old oak barrels
 Whether the wine should be exposed to oxygen during aging (by leaving
airspace in the barrels)
Beyond the famous Tokaj-Hegyalja region, Hungary has numerous other wine
regions that produce a range of dry and semi-dry wines, both white and red,
Most of these wines are named for their grape variety and are quite inexpen-
sive. Kadarka is Hungary’s best-known native red grape variety.
Hungary is now a member of the European Union, and its categories of wine
therefore resemble those of EU countries (see Chapter 4). Wines at the high-
est level are classified as Minosegi Bor (mih no SHAY ghee BOR), followed by
Tájbor (country wine) and Asztali Bor (table wine).
The Glory That Is Greece
We find it hard to comprehend that a country which practically invented
wine, way back in the seventh century BC, could be an emerging wine region
today. But that’s the way it is. Greece never stopped making wine for all those
centuries, but her wine industry took the slow track, inhibited by Turkish
rule, political turmoil, and other real-life issues. The modern era of Greek
winemaking began only in the 1960s, and it has made particularly strong
strides in the past decade. Today, Greek wines are worth knowing.
Although Greece is a southern country and famous for its sunshine, its grape-
growing climate is actually quite varied, because many vineyards are situated
at high altitudes where the weather is cooler. (Most of Greece is mountainous,
in fact.) Its wines are mainly (60 percent) white; some of those whites are
sweet dessert wines, but most are dry.
One of Greece’s greatest wine assets — and handicaps, at the same time — is
its abundance of native grape varieties, over 300 of them. Only Italy has more
indigenous grape varieties. These native grapes make Greek wines particularly
exciting for curious wine lovers to explore, but their unfamiliar names make
the wines difficult to sell. Fortunately for the marketers, Greece also produces
wines from internationally-famous grape varieties such as Chardonnay, Merlot,
Syrah, and Cabernet Sauvignon, and those wines can be very good. These days,
however, producers seem more committed than ever to their native varieties
rather than to international grapes. 
207
Chapter 11: Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Beyond

Of Greece’s many indigenous grape varieties, four in particular stand out as
the most important — two white and two red varieties:
 Assyrtiko (ah SEER tee koe): A white variety that makes delicate, bone
dry, crisp, very long-lived wines with citrusy and minerally aromas and
flavors. Although Assyrtiko grows in various parts of Greece, the best
Assyrtiko wines come from the volcanic island of Santorini. Any wine
called Santorini is made at least 90 percent from Assyrtiko.
 Moschofilero (mos cho FEEL eh roe): A very aromatic, pink-skinned vari-
ety that makes both dry white and pale-colored dry rosé wines grows
mainly around Mantinia, in the central, mountainous Peloponnese region.
If a wine is named Mantinia, it must be at least 85 percent Moschofilero.
Wines made from Moschofilero have high acidity and are fairly low in
alcohol, with aromas and flavors of apricots and/or peaches. Because
they’re so easy to drink, Moschofilero wines are a great introduction to
Greek wines.
 Agiorghitiko (eye your YEE tee koe): The name of this grape translates
in English to “St. George,” and a few winemakers call it that on the labels
of wines destined for English-speaking countries. Greece’s most-planted
and probably most important native red variety, it grows throughout
the mainland. Its home turf, where it really excels, is in the Nemea dis-
trict of the Peloponnese region; any wine named Nemea is entirely
from Agiorghitiko. Wines from this variety are medium to deep in color,
have complex aromas and flavors of plums and/or black currants, and
often have a resemblance to Cabernet Franc or spicy Merlot wines.
Agiorghitiko also blends well with other indigenous or international 
varieties.
 Xinomavro (ksee NO mav roe): The most important red variety in the
Macedonia region of Northern Greece. Xinomavro produces highly
tannic wines with considerable acidity that have been compared to
Nebbiolo wines of Piedmont, Italy. Wines made from Xinomavro have
complex, spicy aromas, often suggesting dried tomatoes, olives, and/or
berries. Xinomavro wines are dark in color but lighten with age, and
have great longevity. Their home base is the Naoussa district of
Macedonia; any wine named Naoussa is entirely from Xinomavro.
Other important white indigenous varieties in Greece include Roditis (actually
a pink-skinned grape), which makes Patras white; and Savatiano, the most
widely planted white grape. Retsina, a traditional Greek wine made by adding
pine resin to fermenting grape juice (resulting in a flavor not unlike some oaky
Chardonnays), is made mainly from Savatiano. Mavrodaphne is an indigenous
Greek red variety that is becoming increasingly important, both for dry and
sweet red wines.
208
Part III: The “Old World” of Wine 

Some of the wine regions of Greece whose names you are likely to see on
wine labels include
 Macedonia: The northernmost part of Greece, with mountainous terrain
and cool climates. Naoussa wine comes from here.
 The Peloponnese: A large, mainly mountainous, peninsula in southwest-
ern Greece with varied climate and soil. Noteworthy wines include the
soft, red Nemea; the dry whites Patras and Mantinia; and the sweet
wines Mavrodaphne de Patras (red) and Muscat de Patras (white).
 Crete: The largest Greek island, which makes both white and red wines,
many of which are varietally-named along with the place-name of Crete.
 Other Greek Islands: Besides Crete, the four most important islands
that make wine are Santorini, Rhodes, Samos, and Cephalonia.
Many Greek wines today are top-quality, especially the wines of small, inde-
pendent wineries. The following are some of our favorite Greek wine produc-
ers (listed alphabetically within regions):
 From Macedonia: Alpha Estate, Domaine Gerovassilou, Kir Yianni Estate,
and Tsantali-Mount Athos Vineyards
 From the Peloponnese: Antonopoulos Vineyards, Gaia Estate (pronounced
YEA ah, has wineries also in Santorini), Katogi & Strofilia (with operations
also in Macedonia), Mercouri Estate, Papantonis Winery, Domaine Skouras,
Domaine Spiropoulos, and Domaine Tselepos
 From the islands: Boutari Estates (six estates throughout Greece, includ-
ing Crete and Santorini), Gentilini (in Cephalonia), and Domaine Sigalas
(Santorini)
Greece is a member of the European Union, and its appellation system for
wine therefore conforms to the EU’s two-tiered structure. At the top (QWPSR)
level Greece has two categories:
 AOQS, Appellation d’Origine de Qualité Supérieure (yes, that’s French!)
for dry and off-dry wines
 AOC, Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée, for dessert and fortified wines
Table wines with a geographic name are called vins de pays (regional wines).
Many of Greece’s better wines in fact carry a vins de pays appellation. Other
terms that have formal definitions under Greek wine regulations include
reserve (QWPSR wines with a minimum two or three years aging, for whites
and reds respectively), grande reserve (one additional year of aging), and
cava (a table wine — in the EU sense of being at the lower appellation tier —
with the same aging requirements as reserve).

Discovering the
New World 
of Wine

In this part . . .
L
ike Columbus in 1492, we set sail for the land of oppor-
tunity, where winemakers grow whichever grapes they
like and make fresh, modern, flavorful wines that electrify
wine drinkers.
This part contains only two chapters, but the countries rep-
resented in them are white-hot in the wine marketplace —
the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina,
and South Africa, for example. We guide you to the most
exciting wines and explain what makes them special.

Chapter 12
The Southern Hemisphere Arises
In This Chapter
 Old World, New World
 Australian wines are hot
 New wines from New Zealand
 Chile and Argentina are happening
 Wine progress in South Africa
W
hat do the wines of North and South America, South Africa, Australia,
and New Zealand have in common? For one thing, none of them are
produced in Europe. In fact, you could say that they are the wines of “Not
Europe.”
The name most often used in wine circles for Not Europe is the New World.
Undoubtedly this phrase, with its ring of colonialism, was coined by a
European. Europe, home of all the classic wine regions of the world, producer
of more than 60 percent of the world’s wine, is the Old World. Everything else
is nouveau riche.
When we first heard the expression New World applied to wines, we thought
it was absurd. How can you lump together wine regions as remote as Napa
Valley, the Finger Lakes, Coonawarra, and Chile’s Maipo Valley? But then we
started thinking about it. In Europe, they’ve been making wines for so long
that grape-growing and winemaking practices are now codified into detailed
regulations. Which hillsides to plant, which grapes should grow where, how
dry or sweet a particular wine should be — these decisions were all made
long ago, by the grandparents and great-great-grandparents of today’s wine-
makers. But in Not Europe, the grape-growing and winemaking game is wide
open; every winery owner gets to decide for himself where to grow his
grapes, what variety to plant, and what style of wine to make. The wines of
the New World do have that in common.

The more we thought about it, the more similarities we found among New
World wine regions as they compared to Europe. We concluded that the New
World is a winemaking entity whose legislative reality, spirit, and winemaking
style are unique from those of the Old World — as generalizations go.
We could easily fill 400 pages on the wines of the United States, Canada,
Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa alone, if only we
had the space. Fortunately, New World wines are easy for you to explore with-
out a detailed road map: In the New World, there’s little encoded tradition to
decipher and relatively little historical backdrop against which the wines
need to be appreciated.
In this chapter, we explore the wines of Australia, New Zealand, Chile,
Argentina, and South Africa. We devote the next chapter to the wines of
the United States, with a short look at Canada, too.
214
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 
The old and the new
In wine terms, the New World is not just geog-
raphy but also an attitude toward wine. Some
winemakers in Europe approach wine the liber-
ated New World way, and some winemakers in
California are dedicated Old World traditionalists.
Keep that in mind as you look over the following
comparison between the Old and the New. And
remember, we’re talking generalizations here —
and generalizations are never always true.

Australian Wine Power
Make no mistake about it: Australia is one of the world powers of wine.
The wine industry of Australia is perhaps the most technologically advanced,
forward-thinking on earth, and the success of Australian wines around the
world is the envy of wine producers in many other countries.
Australia has no native vines. Vinifera grapevines first came to the country in
1788, from South Africa. At first, most Australian wines were rich and sweet,
many of them fortified, but today Australia is famous for its fresh, fruity red
and white table wines that manage to be extremely consistent in quality.
Australia now ranks sixth in the world in wine production — making slightly
more than half as much wine as the United States — and fourth in exports.
Approximately the same size as the continental United States, Australia has
about 2,000 wineries. Many of these wineries are small, family-owned compa-
nies, but four mega-companies — Foster’s Wine Group, Constellation Wines,
Pernod Ricard, and McGuigan Simeon Wines — together with one family-owned
winery, Casella Wines, are responsible for about two-thirds of Australia’s wine
production.
Winemaking, grapes, and terroir
Australia’s wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler part of the coun-
try, with many of them clustered in the state of Victoria, the southern part of
South Australia, the southern part of Western Australia, and the cooler parts
of New South Wales.
The success of Australia’s wines stems from a generally warm, dry climate,
which provides winemakers with excellent raw material for their work.
The country’s research programs in grape-growing and winemaking also 
contribute greatly by enabling winemakers to stay on the cutting edge of
their craft.
Australia’s number-one grape for fine wine is Syrah, locally called Shiraz, fol-
lowed by Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon (pronounced
SEM eh lon in Australia, as opposed to the French sem ee yon elsewhere in
the world), Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc. The wines are generally
labeled with the name of their grape variety, which must constitute at least
85 percent of the wine.
215
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises

Shiraz wines are particularly interesting because they come in numerous
styles, from inexpensive, juicy wines brimming with ripe plum and blackberry
fruit to serious wines that express specific regional characteristics, such as
spice and pepper from cool-climate areas (such as Yarra Valley and the
Adelaide Hills) or sweet-fruit ripeness from warmer areas (such as McLaren
Vale, Barossa, and Clare).
The wines of Australia have two distinct faces:
 Most Australian wines in export markets are inexpensive varietal wines
that sell for $10 a bottle or less. These wines are generally labeled simply
as coming from South Eastern Australia, meaning that the grapes could
have come from any of three states, a huge territory. Often sporting
whimsical labels, they are user-friendly wines that preserve the intense
flavors of their grapes and are soft and pleasant to drink young.
 Higher-priced wines carry more focused regional designations, such as
single states (South Australia or Victoria, for example) or even tighter
region-specific designations (such as Coonawarra or Yarra Valley).
Although these wines are also enjoyable when released, they are more
serious wines that can also age. Australia now has 60 wine regions and
more than 100 Geographic Indications (GIs).
We mention some of the more famous regions of Australia, state by state, in
the following section. If you’re interested in learning about these regions —
and the many others that we don’t mention — in more detail, read Oz Clarke’s
Australian Wine Companion (Websters International, 2004) or James Halliday’s
excellent Wines of Australia (Mitchell Beazley, 2003).
Australia’s wine regions
Australia’s most important state for wine production is South Australia,
whose capital is Adelaide (see Figure 12-1). South Australia makes about
50 percent of Australia’s wine. While many vineyards in South Australia 
produce inexpensive wines for the thirsty home market, vineyards closer
to Adelaide make wines that are considered among the country’s finest.
Among these fine wine regions are
 Barossa Valley: North of Adelaide, this is one of Australia’s oldest areas
for fine wine; it’s a relatively warm area famous especially for its robust
Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Grenache, as well as rich Semillon and
Riesling (grown in the cooler hills). Most of Australia’s largest wineries,
including Penfolds, are based here.
 Clare Valley: North of the Barossa Valley, this climatically diverse area
makes the country’s best Rieslings in a dry, weighty yet crisp style, as
well as fine Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.
216
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

 McLaren Vale: South of Adelaide, with a mild climate influenced by the
sea, this region is particularly admired for its Shiraz, Cabernet,
Sauvignon Blanc, and Chardonnay.
 Adelaide Hills: Situated partially within the Adelaide city limits, this fairly
cool region sits between the Barossa and McLaren Vale areas and is the
home to rather good Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Shiraz.
 Limestone Coast: This unique zone along the southern coast of South
Australia is an important area for fine wine, both red and white, thanks
to the prevalence of limestone in the soil. Two of the six regions within
the Limestone Coast zone are famous in their own right — the cool
Coonawarra for some of Australia’s best Cabernet Sauvignon wines, and
Padthaway for its white wines, particularly Chardonnay, Sauvignon
Blanc, and Riesling.

Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises

Adjoining South Australia to the east is Victoria, a smaller state that makes
15 percent of Australia’s wines. While South Australia is home to most of
Australia’s largest wineries, Victoria has more wineries (over 500), most
of them small. Victoria’s fine wine production ranges from rich, fortified
dessert wines to delicate Pinot Noirs. Principal regions include, from north
to south
 Murray River: This area stretching into New South Wales includes the
Mildura region, where Lindemans, one of Australia’s largest wineries is
situated. This region is particularly important for growing grapes for
Australia’s good-value wines.
 Rutherglen: In the northeast, this long-established, warm climate zone
is an outpost of traditional winemaking and home of an exotic Australian
specialty, fortified dessert Muscats and Tokays.
 Goulburn Valley: In the center of the state, Goulburn Valley is known
especially for its full-bodied reds, especially Shiraz.
 Heathcote: East of Goulburn and due north of Melbourne (the capital),
this area boasts unusual soils that make distinctive, rich-yet-elegant
Shirazes and also Cabernet.
 Yarra Valley: In southern Victoria, and close to Melbourne, Yarra Valley
boasts a wide diversity of climates due to altitude differences of its vine-
yards. The Yarra is noted for its Cabernet, Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Chardonnay,
and Sauvignon Blanc.
 Mornington Peninsula and Geelong: South of Melbourne and separated
from each other by Port Phillip Bay, these two cool, maritime regions
specialize in fine Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
New South Wales, with its capital, Sydney, is Australia’s most populous state,
and the first to grow vines; today it makes 31 percent of Australia’s wine.
High-volume production of everyday wines comes from an interior area
called the Riverina. (We get a kick trying to pronounce its alternate name,
Murrumbidgee.) Fine wine, for now, comes from three other areas:

Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 
Odd couples
Although winemakers all over the world make
blended wines — wines from more than one
grape variety — generally the grape combina-
tions follow the classic French models: Cabernet
Sauvignon with Merlot and Cabernet Franc, for
example, or Sémillon with Sauvignon Blanc.
Australia has invented two completely original
formulas:
 Shiraz with Cabernet Sauvignon
 Semillon with Chardonnay
The grape in the majority is listed first on the
wine label for wines sold in the United States,
and the percentages of each grape are 
indicated.

 Hunter Valley: An historic grape-growing area that begins 80 miles north
of Sydney. The Lower Hunter, with a warm, damp climate and heavy soils,
produces long-lived Semillon as its best wine. The Upper Hunter is a drier
area farther from the coast.
 Mudgee: An interior area near the mountains. Mudgee specializes in reds
such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon but also makes Chardonnay.
 Orange: A cool, high-altitude area making distinctive white wines and
also very good reds.
Western Australia, the country’s largest state, with its most isolated wine
area — in the southwest corner — makes little wine compared to the preced-
ing three states, but quality is high. The warm, dry Swan Valley is the state’s
historic center of wine production, but two cooler climate regions have
become more important:
 Margaret River: This is a relatively temperate region near the Indian
Ocean. Among the wines that various wineries here excel in are Sauvignon
Blanc-Semillon blends (especially Cape Mentelle), Chardonnay (especially
Leeuwin Estate), and Cabernet Sauvignon (from Mosswood, Voyager,
Cape Mentelle, and Howard Park).
 Great Southern: Cooler than Margaret River, Great Southern’s specialty
is crisp, age-worthy Riesling. This huge, diverse region produces intense,
aromatic Cabernet Sauvignon as well as fine Shiraz and Chardonnay; on
the southern coast, Pinot Noir is successful.
Tasmania, an island south of Victoria, has some cool microclimates where
producers such as Pipers Brook are proving what potential exists for delicate
Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays, and sparkling wines.
The Rise of New Zealand
The history of fine winemaking in New Zealand is relatively short, having been
hampered by conservative attitudes towards alcohol. In the 1980s, New Zealand
finally began capitalizing on its maritime climate, ideal for producing high-
quality wines, and started planting grapes in earnest. Today, it makes less than
one-tenth of the wine of its nearest neighbor, Australia, but its production is
increasing every year. And, unlike Australia, New Zealand has managed to main-
tain an elite image for its wines, as opposed to a good-value-for-everyday image.
Situated farther south than Australia, New Zealand is, in general, cooler. Of
New Zealand’s two large islands, the North Island is the warmer. Red grapes
grow around the capital city, Auckland, in the north and around Hawkes Bay
(especially known for its Cabernet Sauvignon) farther south on the North
Island; Müller-Thurgau, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc are that island’s
main white varieties. Martinborough, a cooler district at the southern end of
North Island, makes very good Pinot Noir.
219
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises

On the South Island, Marlborough — the country’s largest and commercially
most important wine region — is New Zealand’s top production zone for
Chardonnay and, especially, Sauvignon Blanc.
The first New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs to be exported were generally unoaked
wines with pronounced flavor, rich texture, and high acidity. They were
so distinctive — pungent, herbaceous, with intense flavors suggestive of
asparagus, lime, or cut grass — that New Zealand became recognized almost
overnight in the late 1980s for a new prototype of Sauvignon Blanc. This style
of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is still very popular worldwide. These are
the least expensive “Kiwi” (as the locals call themselves, being among the
world’s major kiwi growers) Sauvignon Blancs, retailing for $12 to $18, with
many priced around $15.
Another style of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc has evolved in the last decade.
Riper, less assertive, and softer in texture, this style is often achieved through
the use of oak barrels and/or blending with Semillon, and it has fruitier fla-
vors, usually passion fruit or ripe grapefruit. New Zealand wine producers
correctly foresaw that wine drinkers may need an alternative to the herba-
ceous style. The riper, fruitier, less herbaceous New Zealand Sauvignon
Blancs are frequently labeled as “Reserve” wines or as single-vineyard wines.
They generally retail for $18 to $30.
Pinot Noir is increasingly significant in New Zealand. In addition to its strong-
hold in Martinborough, on the North Island, Pinot Noir is now being made in
Marlborough and throughout the South Island, and this grape has now sur-
passed Cabernet Sauvignon as New Zealand’s most planted red variety.
New Zealand Pinot Noirs vary in taste from region to region; the wines of
Martinborough, for example, are a bit more savory and minerally than those
of Marlborough, which tend to be soft and fruity. In time, as the producers of
each region refine their styles, the regional differences should become more
evident.
In the central part of the South Island, Central Otago, home of the world’s
most southerly grapevines, has emerged as one of New Zealand’s top regions
for Pinot Noir. Vines are planted on hillsides for more sunshine and less risk
of frost. The low-yielding vines here produce highly-concentrated Pinot Noir
wines. Mt. Difficulty and Felton Road, both from Central Otago, are currently
two of New Zealand’s best Pinot Noir producers.
Four large producers dominate New Zealand’s wine production: Montana
(sold in the United States under the Brancott label, to avoid confusion with
the state of Montana), Corbans, Villa Maria, and Nobilo. But in the past
20 years, numerous small, boutique wineries have sprung up, especially
on the South Island, and are making excellent wine.
220
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

Chile Discovers Itself
Chile’s wine industry wears the mantle New World somewhat uncomfortably.
The Spanish first established vineyards in Chile in the mid-sixteenth century,
and the country has maintained a thriving wine industry for its home market
for several centuries. Nothing new about that. What is new about Chile, how-
ever, is the growth of her wine industry since the mid-1980s, her rapid devel-
opment of a strong export market, and her shift toward French grape
varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Chardonnay — with an
almost-forgotten red Bordeaux variety called Carmenère definitely in the run-
ning, on the outside post position.
With the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes Mountains to the east,
Chile is an isolated country. This isolation has its advantages in terms
of grape growing: Phylloxera hasn’t yet taken hold in Chile — as it’s done
in just about every other winemaking country — and vinifera vines can 
therefore grow on their own roots. (For an explanation of phylloxera,
see Chapter 3.) Chile’s other viticultural blessings include a range of 
mountains along the coast, which blocks the ocean dampness from most
vineyards, and the ocean’s general tempering influence on a relatively 
hot climate.
221
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises
Current trends in kiwi land
New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs are still hot,
and Pinot Noir seems to be the next Big Thing.
But New Zealand is more than just a two-grape
country. In the white wine category, we’re
impressed with the improved Chardonnays,
Rieslings, and Pinot Gris wines. The biggest sur-
prise could be New Zealand’s really fine
Cabernet Sauvignons, Merlots, and Bordeaux-
blends, not only from established warmer-
climate North Island regions such as Hawke’s
Bay and its Gimblett Road zone, but also from
Waiheke Island, a few miles east of the city of
Auckland, where the climate is mild enough to
grow Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.
New Zealand’s final surprise is that it’s making
excellent sparkling wines by using the classic
method (see Chapter 14 for an explanation of
this winemaking method). Most of the better
New Zealand sparkling wines also use the two
main grape varieties of Champagne, Pinot Noir
and Chardonnay. Highfield Estate is one of New
Zealand’s many fine sparkling wine producers.

Chile’s wine regions
As in every other country, grape growers and wine producers in Chile origi-
nally planted vineyards in the most obvious locations, where grapes would
grow prolifically. Trial and error have gradually enabled them to discover the
less obvious locations — many of them cooler and less accessible areas —
that offer the opportunity to make truly distinctive wines.
Initially considered the ideal place to plant grapes, Maipo Valley is part of
Chile’s vast Central Valley, which lies between the coastal range and the
Andes. Convenience played a large role: The Maipo Valley surrounds Santiago,
Chile’s capital and its largest and most important city. Most of Chile’s vine-
yards are still in the Central Valley, but today, vineyards also exist in regions
that no one had heard of just ten years ago.
From north to south, here’s a summary of Chile’s wine regions today, both
old and new:
 Limari Valley: A small region northwest of Santiago, near the Pacific
Ocean. Although the climate is hot and dry — it’s nearer to the equator
than any of Chile’s other important regions and close to the Atacama
Desert — its unique microclimate, caused by its proximity to the Pacific,
features cooling morning fog and ocean breezes that blow through the
Valley during the day. Chile’s three largest wineries, Concha y Toro, San
Pedro, and Santa Rita, all have bought land in Limari. Promising wines so
far are Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Syrah. This is one of the coun-
try’s hot emerging regions.
 Aconcagua Valley: North of Santiago, Aconcagua Valley is named for the
country’s highest mountain, the magnificent Mount Aconcagua and is
one of the warmest areas for fine grapes. But Aconcagua also includes
many cooler high-altitude sections. Cabernet Sauvignon grows espe-
cially well here, and more recently, Syrah. Viña Errázuriz is Aconcagua
Valley’s most important winery.
 Casablanca Valley: Once considered part of the Aconcagua Valley, the
cooler Casablanca valley, near the Pacific Ocean, now has its own iden-
tity. The first-established of the newer Chilean wine regions, it’s still one
of the best. Some of Chile’s finest Chardonnays and Sauvignon Blancs
grow in one part of Casablanca, while good Merlots and Pinot Noirs come
from a more mountainous part. Veramonte is Casablanca’s best-known
winery, but many other wineries own vineyards in this region.
222
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

 San Antonio Valley: Along with nearby Leyda Valley, tiny San Antonio
Valley, south of Casablanca Valley and next to the ocean, is arguably
Chile’s most exciting new region. Pinot Noir and Syrah are growing espe-
cially well on its cool, steep slopes. Now making one of the world’s best
Pinot Noirs outside of Burgundy and a fine Syrah, Viña Matetic is the
winery to watch in San Antonio Valley.
 Maipo Valley: Chile’s most-established wine region, just south of
Santiago, Maipo Valley is home to most of the country’s wineries.
Concha y Toro, Santa Rita, and Almaviva are a few of Maipo’s premium
producers. Cabernet Sauvignon is king in this region, and Merlot also
does very well.
 Cachapoal Valley: The large Rapel Valley, south of Maipo Valley, has
two main wine regions, Cachapoal Valley and Colchagua Valley.
Cachapoal Valley, nearer the Andes, is a red wine region, and is strong in
Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Morandé and Altair are two rising star
wineries here.
 Colchagua Valley: Ocean breezes have transformed the formerly quiet
Colchagua Valley into one of Chile’s most important new red wine
regions. Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah grow espe-
cially well here. Colchagua’s two leading wineries are Casa Lapostolle
and Montes.
 Curicó Valley: One of Chile’s oldest and largest wine regions, the Curicó
Valley is directly south of Rapel Valley. Because of its diverse microcli-
mates, both red and white varieties grow well here. The huge San Pedro
Winery and Viña Miguel Torres are located in Curicó.
 Maule: Maule Valley is Chile’s largest wine region in area, and also the
southernmost of its important wine regions. Because it’s so huge, it has
many diverse microclimates, and both red and white varieties grow well,
especially Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Viña Calina
is Maule Valley’s best-known winery.
The face and taste of the wines
Stylistically, Chile’s wines generally lack the exuberant fruitiness of Califor-
nian and Australian wines. And yet they’re not quite as subtle and under-
stated as European wines. Although red wines have always been Chile’s
strength, today the white wines, especially those from cooler regions, are
very good. Chile’s Sauvignon Blancs are generally unoaked, while most of 
the Chardonnays are oaked.
223
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises

Like most New World wines, Chile’s wines are generally named for their grape
varieties; they carry a regional (or sometimes a district) indication, too.
The reasonable prices of the basic wines — mainly from $6 to $10 in the
United States — make these wines excellent values. The most important
wineries for the export market include, in alphabetical order, Calina, Caliterra,
Carmen, Casa Lapostolle, Concha y Toro, Cousiño Macul, Errazuriz, Haras
de Pirque, Los Vascos, Montes, Mont Gras, Santa Carolina, Santa Rita, and
Undurraga. Viña Matetic, a rising star from the San Antonio Valley, is just
beginning to appear on the export markets.
Chile’s new challenge is to produce good-quality high-end wines along
with its inexpensive varietals. Many of the top producers now make a 
super-premium red wine in the $45 to $90 price range. These elite Chilean
reds are often blends rather than varietal wines, and many are styled along
international lines — made from very ripe grapes that give rich, fruity
flavors and high (14 percent or higher) alcohol levels, and aged in small
French oak barrels. What many (but not all) of them lack, however, is a
sense of place: They don’t taste particularly Chilean. With time, Chile will
undoubtedly reach its goal and begin producing fine wines that merit their
high prices.
Keep an eye out for some of Chile’s top super-premium red wines:
 Concha y Toro’s Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon (about $45)
 Errázuriz’s Don Maximiano Founder’s Reserve (mainly Cabernet
Sauvignon, about $50)
 Albis, a wine from a joint venture between the Chilean Haras de Pirque
winery and the Italian Antinori company (Cabernet Sauvignon and
Carmenère, about $52)
 Montes Alpha M (a “Bordeaux blend,” about $75)
 Almaviva (a sleek and subtle red, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon with
Carménère and Cabernet Franc, about $90)
 Casa Lapostolle’s Clos Apalta (a blend of Carménère, Merlot, and
Cabernet Sauvignon, about $80)
 Seña, from an estate in Aconcagua that was originally a partnership
between the Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick (of Viña Errázuriz)
families and is now owned by the Chadwicks (Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot, and Carmenère, about $65)

Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

Argentina, a Major League Player
Argentina produces about four times as much wine as Chile does — almost
as much as the entire United States. It boasts the largest wine production in
South America and the fifth-largest wine production in the world. In recent
years, winemaking has shifted away from large-volume wines suited to the
domestic market and toward higher-quality wines that suit wine drinkers out-
side Argentina. Not only is Argentina now a major player in the world wine
market, but it’s one of the world’s most exciting countries for wine production.
Wine grapes have grown in Argentina since the mid-sixteenth century, as they
have in Chile. But Argentina’s source of vines was more diverse; for example,
many vines were brought over by the vast numbers of Italian and Basque
immigrants. As a result, Argentina boasts grape varieties such as Bonarda
and Malbec that are insignificant in Chile.
Regions and grapes
Argentina’s wine regions are situated mainly in the western part of the coun-
try, where the Andes Mountains divide Argentina from Chile. High altitude
tempers the climate, but the vineyards are still very warm by day, cool by
night, and desert dry. Rivers flow through the area from the Andes and pro-
vide water for irrigation.
The vast majority of Argentina’s vineyards are in the state of Mendoza,
Argentina’s largest wine region, which lies at roughly the same latitude
as Santiago, Chile. Within the Mendoza region are various wine districts
(the names of which sometimes appear on wine labels) such as Maipú, San
Martín, Tupungato, and Luján de Cuyo. Most of Argentina’s oldest wineries and
their vineyards are clustered close to Mendoza city, but the Uco Valley, south of
the city, has attracted many newcomers who are building impressive wineries.
San Juan, just north of Mendoza and considerably hotter, is Argentina’s
second-largest wine region. La Rioja, Argentina’s oldest wine-producing
region, is east of San Juan.
San Juan is particularly famous for Torrontés, a variety that’s probably
indigenous to Galicia, Spain. It produces an inexpensive ($6 to $10), light-
bodied, high-acid, aromatic white wine that’s one of Argentina’s signature
white wines. It’s especially fine with appetizers, seafood, and fish.
225
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises

Argentina’s red wines are generally higher in quality than its whites.
The little-known Malbec grape variety — now seldom used in Bordeaux,
where it originated — has emerged as Argentina’s flagship variety. Malbec
has adapted extremely well to the Mendoza region, and winemakers are
learning how it varies in Mendoza’s subzones. Arguments continue as to
which variety makes Argentina’s greatest red wines, Cabernet Sauvignon or
Malbec. But the fact remains that good Cabernet wines come from almost
every wine-producing country; only Argentina and Cahors, a small region in
Southwest France, have had success with Malbec. The same logic suggests
that Bonarda and Barbera, two northern Italian varieties that are widely
planted in Argentina (especially Bonarda), have a good future there.
Names to know
Thanks in part to its high altitudes and sunny days, Argentina’s natural
resources for grape growing are among the strongest in the world.
Increasingly, foreign investment continues to bring the capital and the wine-
making know-how to make the most of these natural resources. Bodega
Norton, for example, a winery that was purchased by an Austrian crystal 
producer in 1989, now makes some of the country’s best wines. Moët &
Chandon, another immigrant, is already Argentina’s largest sparkling wine
producer; it also makes the Terrazas varietal table wines. A Dutchman owns
the state-of-the-art Bodegas Salentein winery and its sister winery, Finca El
Portillo. Kendall Jackson has a presence, with its Viña Calina, as do several
Bordeaux producers, such as Bordeaux’s Lurton family, which owns Bodega
J. & F. Lurton.
French enologist Michel Rolland has worked wonders at Trapiche; try
Trapiche’s great-value Oak Cask Cabernet Sauvignon or Oak Cask Malbec,
both about $10. In fact Rolland, who knows the world’s vineyards as well as
anyone, has personally invested in an Argentine winery, Clos de los Siete; that
says something about Argentina’s potential!
The homegrown Catena Zapata has emerged as one of Argentina’s top wine
producers. At $10 a bottle, its Alamos Malbec is one of the greatest wine
values around. Catena Cabernet Sauvignon or Malbec (both about $21), and
the super-premium Malbec Alta or Cabernet Sauvignon Alta, both about $50,
are higher-end wines, among the finest being made in South America today.
Other Argentine producers we recommend include Bodega Norton, Bodega J.
& F. Lurton, Bodegas Salentein, Bodega Weinert, Trapiche, Etchart, Finca
Sophenia, Achaval Ferrer, Pascual Toso, Michel Torino, Las Terrazas, Navarro
Correas, Santa Julia, El Portillo, Dona Paula, and Valentín Bianchi. Some of
Argentina’s basic wines are priced the same as Chile’s, in the $6 to $10 range,
but a few wineries make pricier wines starting in the $18 to $20 range.
226
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

South African Wine Safari
Vines came to South Africa in the 1650s with the Dutch, the first European
settlers; in the same period, French Huguenots (Protestants) escaping 
religious persecution brought winemaking expertise. At the end of the eigh-
teenth century, South Africa was producing a luscious fortified wine called
Constantia, which became sought after in European royal courts. The coun-
try began focusing seriously on table wine production only in the 1980s.
Today, South Africa ranks ninth in the world in wine production.
Most of South Africa’s table wines come from an area known as the Coastal
Region, around the Cape of Good Hope. Traditionally, large firms dominated
South Africa’s wine industry, and they continue to do so. KWV, formerly a
wine growers’ cooperative, is one of the country’s largest wineries. South
Africa’s largest winery, the gigantic Distell firm, owns two groups of wineries
that had been among the country’s largest wine companies — Stellenbosch
Farmers’ Winery Group and the Bergkelder Group.
South Africa’s principal wine regions
South Africa has some vineyard areas with cool microclimates, especially
around the southern coast (near the Cape of Good Hope) and in higher alti-
tudes, but the climate in most of its wine regions is warm and dry.
South Africa’s Wine of Origin legislation in 1973 created various wine regions,
districts and wards. Almost all the country’s vineyards are near its south-
western coast, in Cape Province, within 90 miles of Cape Town, the country’s
most fascinating and picturesque city.
227
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises
South African style
Although we technically place South Africa in the
New World, we must admit that its wines are
rather reminiscent of European wines. The taste
of a South African Cabernet Sauvignon, for
example, may remind you of a French wine —
but not quite. On the other hand, it doesn’t really
resemble a New World red from California or
Australia, either. South African wines manage
to combine the subtlety and finesse of French
wines along with a touch of the voluptuous
ripeness of California wines. In short, they are
somewhat between both worlds.

The five major districts — mainly in the Coastal Region area — are
 Constantia: The oldest wine-producing area in the country (located
south of Cape Town)
 Stellenbosch: East of Cape Town; the most important wine district in
quantity and quality
 Paarl: North of Stellenbosch; home of the KWV and the famous, beauti-
ful Nederburg Estate; the second-most important wine district
 Franschhoek Valley: A subdistrict of Paarl; many innovative wine-
makers here
 Robertson: East of Franschhoek, the only major district not in the
Coastal Region; a hot, dry area, known mainly for its Chardonnays
The small, cool Hermanus/Walker Bay area, bordering the Indian Ocean, is
also showing promise with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, led by the innovative
Hamilton Russell Winery. A newly added (11th) wine district, Elgin, is on the
coast between Stellenbosch and Walker Bay. A cool area, Elgin shows promise
for its intensely flavored Sauvignon Blancs and for Pinot Noirs. The latest area
to show promise is Darling Hills, north of Cape Town, led by an up-and-coming
winery, Groote Post.
Varietal wines in South Africa must contain at least 75 percent of the named
grape variety; exported wines (complying with the stricter European Union
regulations) must contain 85 percent of the named variety. About 35 percent
of South Africa’s wines qualify as Wine of Origin (WO). Wine of Origin regula-
tions are based on the French Appellation Contrôlée laws (see Chapter 9), and
they strictly designate vineyards, allowable grape varieties, vintage-dating,
and so on.
Steen, Pinotage, and company
The most-planted grape variety in South Africa is Chenin Blanc, often locally
called Steen. This versatile grape primarily makes medium-dry to semi-sweet
wines, but also dry wines, sparkling wines, late harvest botrytis wines, and rosés.
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz, and Pinot Noir have become increasingly
important red varieties, while Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay are popular
white varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc do particularly well
in South Africa’s climate. (Producers here make a very assertive version of
Sauvignon Blanc.)
228
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

And then you have Pinotage. Uniquely South African, Pinotage is a grape born
as a crossing between Pinot Noir and Cinsaut (the same as Cinsault, the Rhône
variety) back in 1925. However, Pinotage didn’t appear as a wine until 1959.
Pinotage wine combines the cherry fruit of Pinot Noir with the earthiness of
a Rhône wine. It can be a truly delicious, light- to medium-bodied red wine
that makes for easy drinking, or a more powerful red. Although many good
Pinotage wines sell for $12 to $16, the best Pinotages cost more. Kanonkop
Estate, a specialist in this variety, makes a $30 Pinotage. Simonsig Estate
makes a fine Pinotage for $13 to $14.
While Pinotage is a pleasant wine, certainly worth trying, we believe South
Africa’s future is with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Shiraz (and blends 
of these grapes) for its red wines and Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay for 
its whites.
229
Chapter 12: The Southern Hemisphere Arises
South Africa: The future
Chenin Blanc and Pinotage represent South
Africa’s recent past — although both are under-
going a revival today. Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot, and Chardonnay are definitely making
fine wines here now, but Sauvignon Blanc and
Shiraz seem to hold the most promise in this
country. Sauvignon Blanc is a no-brainer; some
of the world’s best Sauvignon Blanc varietal
wines are already being made here. The flavor-
ful character of Sauvignon Blanc asserts itself
in South Africa, especially in Constantia and in a
new cool-climate district, Elim, in Cape Agulhas.
Although South African Sauvignon Blancs
resemble those from New Zealand, they are
easier to drink and not quite as assertive. Shiraz
has become the hot, new variety of the Southern
Hemisphere, and indeed throughout the world.
What South African winemakers love about
Shiraz is its versatility. It can grow well in cool
and in warm climates. Right now, Shiraz is the
fastest-growing variety being planted in South
Africa. In ten years or less, it may be the coun-
try’s biggest-selling varietal wine.

W
hen the conquistadors came to the New World of America in search of
gold, Spanish missionaries accompanied them and planted the first
wine grapevines in what is now southern California. These “Mission” grapes,
as they were called, still exist, but the noble grape varieties — Cabernet
Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and the rest of the gang — have supplanted them to
produce today’s fine wines. One thing that hasn’t changed is that California is
still the focus of the American wine scene, although most of the wine business
has moved north; southern California is now mainly filled with cars and people!
In this chapter, we cover American wines, paying particular attention to
California’s special wine regions, Napa Valley and Sonoma, but also dis-
cussing California’s other wine regions, along with Oregon, Washington, and
New York. We end with a quick look at Canada’s up-and-coming wines.
The New World of American Wine
Even though the United States produced wine commercially in the nineteenth
century, the U.S. wine industry made it big only beginning in the 1970s.
Prohibition from 1920 to 1933, the Great Depression, and WWII were serious
blows to the wine business — and recovery was slow.
Before 1970, only a few dozen operating wineries existed in California; today,
the state has well over 800 bonded wineries (about a dozen or so “giants,”
but mainly small, family-owned operations).

California’s growth has stimulated interest in wine all across the country.
Today, wineries exist in all the 50 United States. But wine production is an
important industry in only four states: California (the largest wine producing
state, by far), Washington, Oregon, and New York. The United States currently
is fourth in world wine production — although well behind the two leaders,
Italy and France. (Spain is a distant third.)
Homegrown ways
The wines of the United States — especially California — are the essence of
New World wine-think. Winemakers operate freely, planting whatever grape
variety they wish, wherever they wish to plant it. They blend wines from 
different regions together as they wish. (Blending among states is trickier,
because of federal rules.)
U.S. wines have elevated grape varieties to star status. Until California began
naming wines after grapes, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet
Sauvignon were just behind-the-scenes ingredients of wine — but now they
are the wine. Lest anyone think that all wines from a particular grape are the
same, however, winemakers have emerged as celebrities who put their personal
spin on the best wines. In the California scenario especially, the land — the
terroir — has been secondary, at least until recently.
American winemakers have embraced technology in their efforts to 
create wines that taste like fruit. California’s two important universities 
for winemaking — California State University at Fresno and, especially, the
University of California at Davis — have become world leaders in the scien-
tific study of wine. Even European winemakers now make pilgrimages to
California to study at U.C. Davis.
Playing by their own rules
An appellation system for wines does exist in the United States, and like the
classic French model, the country defines various vineyard regions. But the
U.S. system of American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) establishes only the geo-
graphical boundaries of wine zones; it doesn’t stipulate which grape varieties
can be planted, the maximum yield of grapes per acre (see Chapter 5), or any-
thing else that would link the geography to a particular style of wine. AVA
names, the names of the regions of production, therefore logically have sec-
ondary importance on wine labels after the name of the grape.
232
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

Wines labeled with the name of a grape variety in the United States must con-
tain at least 75 percent of that grape variety, according to federal law. Wines
with an AVA indication must be made least 85 percent from grapes from that
viticultural area. Wines with vintage years must derive at least 85 percent
from the named vintage.
California, USA
When most wine drinkers think about American wine, they think of California.
That’s not surprising — the wines of California make up about 88 percent of
U.S. wine production.
California’s Gallo winery is the largest winery in the state — in fact, until
recently, it was the largest wine company in the world — producing one out
of every four bottles of wine sold in the United States. (Recently, a large
New York-based corporation, Constellation Brands, became the world’s
largest wine company through a series of acquisitions.)
233
Chapter 13: America, America
A smorgasbord of AVAs
In naming their wines, winemakers often choose
to use a broader AVA designation rather than a
smaller, more specific one, in order to widen their
options in buying grapes and wine. A winery in
Alexander Valley, within Sonoma County, for
example, may use the broader Sonoma County
AVA instead of Alexander Valley if it buys grapes
from (or owns vineyards in) other areas of the
county and wishes to use those grapes in its wine.
It can use the larger North Coast AVA if it blends in
grapes or wine from neighboring counties, like
Napa. And if low price is a goal, the winery will use
the even broader California AVA in order to buy
cheaper grapes from the industrially-farmed vine-
yards of the Central Valley (the San Joaquin Valley)
or other parts of the state where grapes and wine
are less expensive than in Sonoma County.
Sometimes wineries use the California appella-
tion even for their better wines, to give them-
selves complete freedom in sourcing their
grapes. (This practice doesn’t occur in smaller
viticultural areas, such as southern Pennsylvania,
where there are few alternative sources of
grapes.) While specificity of place is admired,
on the one hand, making a good wine at a good
price through geographical blending is also
admired. The relative merits depend on who’s
doing the admiring.
Traditional or not, America’s way of making and
naming wine sits just right with its local wine
drinkers: American wines now account for
about 70 percent of all wine sales in the United
States.

It was the Robert Mondavi Winery, however, that stimulated fine wine 
production in the United States. Robert Mondavi left his family’s winery
(Charles Krug Winery) to start his own operation in 1966, a winery dedicated
to making premium wines. These finer wines — his own, and those of the
many producers who would follow in his steps — would be varietally named
Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and so on. Identifying the wines by their
grape varieties was a reaction against the low-priced jug wines that were then
popular, wines labeled with names borrowed from Europe’s wine regions,
such as Burgundy and Chablis. Today, even Gallo is very much in the varietal
wine business. And Robert Mondavi Winery is part of the huge Constellation
Wines Corporation.
Where California wines grow
In sunny California, there’s no lack of warm climate for growing grapes. For
fine wine production, the challenge is to find areas cool enough, with poor
enough soil, so that grapes don’t ripen too quickly, too easily, without full
flavor development (see “Vine-growing vernacular” in Chapter 5). Nearness to
the Pacific Coast and higher altitudes both assure cooler climates more so
than latitude does. Fine wines therefore come from vineyards up and down
almost the whole length of the state.
The most important fine wine areas and districts include the following (see
Figure 13-1):
 North Coast: 
Napa Valley
Sonoma County
Mendocino and Lake Counties
234
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 
Signifying nothing
The words reserve, special selection, private
reserve, barrel select, vintners reserve, classic,
and so on have no legal definition in the United
States. Although many premium wineries use
these terms to indicate their special or better
wines, most of the larger wineries use the same
terms on their inexpensive bottlings as market-
ing tools (see Chapter 4).

When the wines are good
Weather variations from year to year are far less dramatic in California than
they are in most European wine regions. One major reason is that rain doesn’t
fall during the growing season in much of California. (Rain at the wrong time
is the usual cause of Europe’s poorer vintages.) Using irrigation, winemakers,
in effect, control the water to the vines. Ironically, one factor that can cause
vintage variation in California is lack of water for irrigation due to drought.
Napa Valley: As Tiny as It Is Famous
Napa Valley is about a 90-minute drive northeast of the beautiful bay city of
San Francisco. Many of California’s most prestigious wineries — and certainly
its most expensive vineyard land — are in the small Napa Valley, where about
240 wineries have managed to find space. (In 1960, Napa Valley had only
25 wineries.) The region’s size is actually much tinier than its reputation:
Napa produces less than five percent of California’s wine grapes.
The southern part of the Valley, especially the Carneros district, is the coolest
area, thanks to ocean breezes and mists from the San Pablo Bay. Carneros —
which extends westward into Sonoma County — has become the vineyard area
of choice for grape varieties that enjoy the cool climate: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir,
Merlot, and grapes for sparkling wines. North towards Calistoga — away from
the bay influence — the climate gets quite hot (but always with cool nights).
Wineries and vineyards occupy almost every part of Napa Valley. Many vine-
yards are on the valley floor, some are in the hills and mountains to the west
(the Mayacamas Mountains), and some are in the mountains to the east
(especially Howell Mountain). Napa winemakers and grape growers have
established 14 AVAs besides the broad Napa Valley AVA itself and the even
broader (six-county) North Coast AVA:

Red wines finally catching up with Chardonnay
Chardonnay has been the perennial sales leader
among varietal wines in the United States for the
past 20 years or so. But Americans are drinking
more red wine these days, and red wines are
finally catching up to the big C. In addition to the
usual suspects — Cabernet Sauvignon (still the
leading seller), Cabernet blends, and Merlot —
Pinot Noir, red Zinfandel and Shiraz (or Syrah,
depending on the winery’s inclination for naming)
are growing in popularity.

 Spring Mountain, Diamond Mountain and Mt. Veeder (all in the western
mountains)
 Howell Mountain, Stags Leap District, Atlas Peak (all hilly or mountain-
ous areas in eastern Napa Valley)
 Chiles Valley (in the easternmost part of Napa Valley)
 Oak Knoll District, Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford, and St. Helena
(from south to north on the valley floor; Calistoga, a fifteenth AVA,
is pending)
 Wild Horse Valley (in southeastern Napa Valley)
 Los Carneros (part in Napa Valley, part in Sonoma)
The grapes of Napa
Almost everyone in Napa who makes table wine makes a Cabernet Sauvignon
and a Chardonnay, and many Napa producers now also make Merlot.
The six most important wines in Napa are the two whites, Chardonnay
and Sauvignon Blanc (often labeled Fumé Blanc), and the four red wines,
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir (mainly from cool Carneros), and
Zinfandel. But blended wines have become increasingly important in the last
15 years. If red, these blends are usually made from red Bordeaux varieties
(Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and sometimes even Malbec
and Petit Verdot). If white, they’re usually made from the white Bordeaux
grapes (Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon). Some of these blends are referred
to as Meritage wines — not just in Napa but across the United States —
although few carry the word Meritage on their labels.
Who’s who in Napa (and for what)
If just about every winery in Napa makes a Chardonnay and a Cabernet
Sauvignon, how can you distinguish the wineries from one another? Good
question — with no easy answer. The following alphabetical list indicates
some of the better wine producers in Napa Valley, as well as their best wines,
and can help steer you in the right direction. We know the list looks over-
whelming, but . . . that’s Napa!
Our list includes Napa classics as well as some personal favorites. We cover
sparkling wine producers in Chapter 14.
237
Chapter 13: America, America

Although all the wineries in the following list are situated in Napa Valley, their
wines are not necessarily always made with Napa-grown grapes; the geo-
graphic name on the label tells you where the grapes came from.

From $6 to $100-plus
You can find Chardonnays, Cabernets, Pinot
Noirs, and Merlots from California at prices as
low as $6 a bottle. Better wines can be quite
expensive, however. Most mid-range varietal
wines are in the $25 to $60 range. Reserves,
single-vineyard wines, and special selection
wines generally cost $50 to $100 and up.
Sauvignon Blancs — somewhat less in demand
than Chardonnay, Cabernet, Pinot Noir, and
Merlot — are the best values among California’s
premium wines. You can find many good ones
for around $18, although a few are priced as
high as $40. Red Zinfandels are also still a bar-
gain, but their prices are climbing as they
become more popular. You can still find many
red Zins from $12 to $20, although a few pre-
mium Zinfandels are well over $20. If you like
White Zinfandels, which are distinctly sweeter
than the reds, you can save yourself a bundle;
they’re in the $5 to $8 range.

Down-to-Earth in Sonoma
If you leave San Francisco over the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge, you’ll be in
Sonoma in an hour. The differences between Napa and Sonoma are remark-
able. Many of Napa’s wineries are showy (even downright luxurious), but
most of Sonoma’s are rustic, country-like, and laid-back. The millionaires
bought into Napa; Sonoma is just folks (with some exceptions, of course).
On the other hand, the famously successful Gallo is also in Sonoma, and so are
Sebastiani, Glen Ellen, Korbel, Kendall-Jackson, Simi, and Jordan wineries —
not exactly small time operations! We have the sneaking impression that if we
visit Sonoma in ten years, it will bear a striking resemblance to Napa. But we
hope not; we like it just the way it is.
Sonoma’s AVAs
Sonoma is more than twice as large as Napa, it’s more spread out, and it has
almost as many wineries — more than 200. Its climate is similar to Napa’s,
except that some areas near the coast are definitely cooler. Although there’s
plenty of Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot in Sonoma, the region’s
varied microclimates and terrain have allowed three other varieties — Pinot
Noir, Zinfandel, and Sauvignon Blanc — to excel.
The following are the viticultural areas (AVAs) of Sonoma County listed
roughly from south to north with their principal grape varieties and wines:
 Los Carneros (part in Napa Valley): Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, sparkling
wine, and Merlot
 Sonoma Valley: Chardonnay (to a lesser extent, Pinot Noir, Cabernet
Sauvignon, Zinfandel)
 Sonoma Mountain: Cabernet Sauvignon
 Bennett Valley: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot
 Russian River Valley: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, sparkling wine, Zinfandel
 Sonoma-Green Valley (within Russian River Valley): Sparkling wine,
Chardonnay, Pinot Noir
 Chalk Hill (within Russian River Valley): Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc
 Dry Creek Valley: Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon
 Alexander Valley: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc
 Knight’s Valley: Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc
 Rockpile (a new AVA, in the northwestern part of the county): Zinfandel,
Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah
241
Chapter 13: America, America

Sonoma County has two more AVAs: Northern Sonoma, a patchwork area
encompassing Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, and
Knight’s Valley; and Sonoma Coast, a hodgepodge of land in western Sonoma,
along the coast. Also, the North Coast AVA takes in Sonoma County.
Pinot Noir lovers should look for wines from Russian River Valley producers,
such as Williams & Selyem, Rochioli, Gary Farrell, Lynmar, and Dehlinger.
We agree with those who say that the Russian River Valley is the source of
some of the best Pinot Noir in the entire New World.
Sonoma producers and wines
The following list of recommended producers includes some of Sonoma’s
better wineries, listed alphabetically, along with their best wines. It’s slightly
less staggering than the Napa list.
Although these wineries are all in Sonoma County, some of their wines are
made from grapes grown elsewhere. Cline Cellars, for example, uses grapes
from Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco. Check the labels to find out.

Mendocino and Lake Counties
Lake County, dominated by Clear Lake, is Napa’s neighbor to the north, and
Mendocino County is directly north of Sonoma.
If you have the chance, it’s worth your while to drive up the beautiful
California coastline from San Francisco on Route 1 to the quaint, old town
of Mendocino — perhaps with a side trip to view the magnificent, giant red-
woods of the Pacific Coast. Tourists are scarcer up here than in Napa or
Sonoma, and that makes it all the nicer: You’ll be genuinely welcomed at the
wineries.
The cool Anderson Valley in Mendocino County is ideal for growing
Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Gewürztraminer, and Riesling, and for the production
of sparkling wine. The wily Louis Roederer Champagne house bypassed
Napa and Sonoma to start its sparkling wine operation here and has done
extremely well in a short time — as have Scharffenberger and Handley, two
other successful sparkling wine producers in Anderson Valley (see Chapter 14
for more sparkling wine producers).
The following list includes recommended producers and their best wines.
We list the producers alphabetically, by county.

San Francisco Bay Area
The San Francisco Bay area includes wine regions north, east, and south of
the city: Marin County to the north; Alameda County and Livermore Valley to
the east; and Santa Clara Valley and San Mateo County to the south.
The urban spread east and south of San Francisco, from the cities of Palo Alto
to San Jose (Silicon Valley) and eastward, has taken its toll on vineyards in the
Livermore and Santa Clara Valleys. These two growing regions, both cooled
by breezes from the San Francisco Bay, are now relatively small.
In Livermore, directly east of San Francisco, Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon
have always done well. In Santa Clara Valley, south of San Francisco with the
Santa Cruz Mountains on its western side, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon,
and Merlot are the three big grape varieties (and wines).
We list our recommended wineries alphabetically, by locality.
Marin County
 Kalin Cellars: Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir;
grapes from diverse areas, including Livermore
 Sean H. Thackrey: Orion Old Vines Red (Syrah blend), Sirius (Petite
Sirah); grapes come from several different areas, including Napa
Alameda County
 Edmunds St. John: Syrah, Rocks and Gravel (Rhône blend); grapes are
sourced from throughout the state
 Rosenblum Cellars: Zinfandel (especially single-vineyards); uses mainly
Sonoma Valley and Napa Valley fruit

Santa Cruz Mountains
Standing atop one of the isolated Santa Cruz Mountains, you can quickly
forget that you’re only an hour’s drive south of San Francisco. The rugged,
wild beauty of this area has attracted quite a few winemakers, including some
of the best in the state. (Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards and Randall Grahm
of Bonny Doon are but two.) The climate is cool on the ocean side, where
Pinot Noir thrives. On the San Francisco Bay side, Cabernet Sauvignon is the
important red variety. Chardonnay is a leading variety on both sides.
We list our recommended Santa Cruz Mountains wine producers alphabeti-
cally, along with their best wines:
 Bargetto: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot
 Bonny Doon Vineyard: Le Cigare Volant Red (Rhône blend), Old
Telegram (Mourvèdre)
 David Bruce Winery: Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz), Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
 Cinnabar Vineyards: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon
 Kathryn Kennedy Winery: Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah
 Mount Eden Vineyards: Chardonnay Estate, Cabernet Sauvignon Estate,

What’s New in Old Monterey
Monterey County has a little bit of everything — a beautiful coastline, the
chic town of Carmel, some very cool (as in temperature, not chicness) vine-
yard districts and some very warm areas, mountain wineries and Salinas
Valley wineries, a few gigantic wine firms and lots of small ones. Like most
California wine regions, Monterey has been changing rapidly during the past
two decades, and now seven official viticultural areas (AVAs) exist here, cov-
ering about 75 wineries:
 Arroyo Seco
 Carmel Valley
 Chalone
 Hames Valley
 Monterey

Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

 San Luca
 Santa Lucia Highlands
Santa Lucia Highlands, in particular, has been garnering attention as the “hot”
new region for California Pinot Noir.
Chardonnay is the leading varietal wine in Monterey County — as it is in most
of the state. But the cooler parts of Monterey are also principal sources of
Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are the
leading red varieties in the mountain areas.
The following are our recommended producers in Monterey County, listed
alphabetically, along with one producer from neighboring San Benito County:
 Bernardus Winery: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Marinus (mainly
Cabernet Sauvignon), Pinot Noir
 Calera (San Benito County): Pinot Noir (especially single-vineyard 
selections), Viognier, Chardonnay
 Chalone Vineyard: Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Noir
 Chateau Julien: Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon
 Estancia Estates: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir
 Morgan Winery: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Syrah
 Paraiso Vineyards: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling, Syrah
 Robert Talbott Vineyards: Chardonnay

Chapter 13: America, America
Santa Lucia Highlands
The quest for the next great Pinot Noir region in
the world is somewhat akin to the quest for the
Holy Grail. The latest “hot” region, although it’s
definitely cool, is the Santa Lucia Highlands, a
remote area perched high in the southwest part
of Monterey County and sheltered from the
Pacific Ocean by the majestic Santa Lucia
Mountains. Most of the Santa Lucia Highlands
area, which has vineyards up to 1,400 feet in alti-
tude, lies above the morning fog line, and enjoys
plenty of sunshine, with afternoon breezes
coming from Monterey Bay. The relatively cool
temperatures, low rainfall, well-drained granitic
soils, and a long growing season combine to pro-
vide ideal conditions for Chardonnay and Pinot
Noir. But it’s the Pinot Noir that excites wine
lovers and critics — after all, good Chardonnay
is not such a rarity. The Pinots generally have
plenty of acidity and intensely flavored fruit
character, including mineral notes. Most of the
wineries in the region are smallish, so you have
to search a while to find them, but if you’re a
Pinot Noir lover, you may not mind; half of the fun
is in the quest. Some Santa Lucia Highlands
wineries we recommend for Pinot Noir include
Morgan Winery, Paraiso Vineyards, Pisoni Vine-
yard, Sea Smoke Winery, Siduri Wines, and Tes-
tarossa Vineyards. Some of the very best of
these Pinot Noirs are sourced from Pisoni’s vine-
yards, and are identified as such on the labels.

Thar’s Wine in Them There Foothills
No wine region in America has a more romantic past than the Sierra Foothills.
The Gold Rush of 1849 carved a place in history for the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains. It also brought vineyards to the area to provide wine for the
thirsty miners. One of the vines planted at that time was certainly Zinfandel —
still the region’s most famous wine. Many of the oldest grapevines in the
United States, some over 100 years old — mainly Zinfandel — are here in the
Sierra Foothills.
In fact, very little has changed in the Sierra Foothills over the years. This is
clearly most rustic wine region on the West Coast — and perhaps in the coun-
try. Therein lies its charm. A visit to the Foothills is like a trip into the past,
when life was simple.
The Sierra Foothills is a sprawling wine region east of Sacramento, centered
in Amador and El Dorado Counties, but spreading north and south of both.
Two of its best-known viticultural areas are Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown.
Summers can be hot, but many vineyards are situated as high as 1,500 feet —
such as around Placerville in El Dorado — and evenings are very cool. Soil
throughout the region is mainly volcanic in origin.
The following are our recommended producers in the Sierra Foothills (listed
alphabetically), along with their best wines:
 Amador Foothill Winery: Zinfandel
 Boeger Winery: Zinfandel, Barbera, Sauvignon Blanc
 Karly: Zinfandel, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne
 Lava Cap Winery: Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah

Contrasts in San Luis Obispo
San Luis Obispo County is an area of vastly diverse viticultural areas.
These include, for example, the warm, hilly Paso Robles region (north of
the town of San Luis Obispo) where Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon reign,
and the cool, coastal Edna Valley and Arroyo Grande (south of the town),
home of some very good Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays.
Paso Robles, with over 90 wineries, is in the heart of California’s Central
Coast, about equidistant from San Francisco and Los Angeles. Its wines are
so different from those of the two coastal areas that we name the producers
separately. We recommend the following producers in San Luis Obispo
(listed alphabetically, along with their best wines):
Paso Robles
 Adelaida Cellars: Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon
 Eberle Winery: Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Viognier
 EOS Estate Winery: Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah
 Justin Vineyards: Isosceles (Cabernet blend), Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay
 Meridian Vineyards (also has vineyards in Edna Valley and Santa
Barbara): Chardonnay (especially Reserve), Syrah
 Peachy Canyon Winery: Zinfandel
 Rabbit Ridge Vineyards: Zinfandel, Primitivo, Syrah, Pinot Grigio
 Tablas Creek Vineyard: Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah, Roussanne
 Treana Winery: Red (mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah), White
(mainly Marsanne and Viognier)

Santa Barbara, Californian Paradise
The most exciting viticultural areas in California — if not in the entire 
country — are in Santa Barbara County. Even though Spanish missionaries
planted vineyards there 200 years ago, it wasn’t until 1975 that the first major
winery (Firestone Vineyards) opened. In light of what we now know — that is,
how well-suited Santa Barbara is to grape growing — 1975 was a late start.
The cool Santa Maria, Santa Ynez, and Los Alamos Valleys — which lie north
of the city of Santa Barbara — run east to west, opening toward the Pacific
Ocean and channeling in the ocean air. The cool climate is ideal for Pinot Noir
and Chardonnay. In the Santa Maria Valley, one of the main sources of these
varieties, the average temperature during the growing season is a mere 74°F.
Farther south, in the Santa Ynez Valley, Riesling also does well.
Long before the film Sideways brought new attention and tourists to Santa
Barbara wineries and restaurants, Pinot Noir had earned Santa Barbara much
of its acclaim as a wine region. Santa Barbara is generally recognized as one
of the six great American wine regions for this variety — the other five being
Carneros, the Russian River Valley, Santa Lucia Highlands, Mendocino County’s
Anderson Valley and Oregon’s Willamette Valley. In Santa Barbara, Pinot Noir
wines seem to burst with luscious strawberry fruit, laced with herbal tones.
These wines tend to be precocious; they’re delicious in their first four or five
years — not the “keepers” that the sturdier, wilder-tasting Russian River
Pinot Noirs seem to be. But why keep them when they taste so good?
The following are some recommended producers in Santa Barbara (listed
alphabetically), and their best wines:
 Alma Rosa: Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir
 Au Bon Climat: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay (especially single-vineyard bot-
tlings of both), Pinot Gris/Pinot Blanc
 Babcock Vineyards: Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir
 The Brander Vineyard: Sauvignon Blanc
 Byron Vineyard: Chardonnay (especially Nielson Vineyard), Pinot Noir
 Cambria Winery: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir (Julia’s Vineyard), Syrah
 Cottonwood Canyon: Pinot Noir
 Daniel Gehrs: Chenin Blanc, Dry Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Syrah
 Fess Parker Winery: Chardonnay, Syrah, Pinot Noir
 Fiddlehead Cellars: Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc

Elsewhere in California
One interesting winery in California’s Central Valley, one in the Dunnigan Hills
(north of the Central Valley), and one in southern California complete our por-
trait of recommended California wineries. Although these locations are normally
too warm to grow grapes for fine wine, variables such as altitude — or, in the
case of southern California, cool ocean breezes — create microclimates con-
ducive to the production of fine wine.
Central Valley
 Bogle Vineyards: Petite Sirah, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, Merlot
Dunnigan Hills (Yolo County)
 R. H. Phillips Vineyard: Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, and Tempranillo
(all under the “EXP” brand); Chardonnay Estate (Toasted Head)

Oregon, A Tale of Two Pinots
Because Oregon is north of California, most people assume that Oregon’s
wine regions are cool. And they’re right. But the main reason for Oregon’s
cool climate is that no high mountains separate the vineyards from the
Pacific Ocean. The ocean influence brings cool temperatures and rain.
Grapegrowing and winemaking are really completely different in Oregon and
California.
Winemaking is a fairly new industry in Oregon, but it’s growing rapidly. From
a handful of wineries in the early 1970s, the state had 314 wineries in 2005 —
an increase of 140 wineries in the past four years! Most of Oregon’s wineries
are small, family-owned operations. The exception in terms of size is King
Estate, Oregon’s largest winery, but even King Estate is relatively small com-
pared to some of the wine behemoths of California.
Oregon first gained respect in wine circles for its Pinot Noir, a grape that
needs cool climates to perform at its best (see “A Primer on Red Grape
Varieties” in Chapter 3). The Eyrie Vineyards released Oregon’s first Pinot
Noir in 1970, but national recognition for the state’s Pinots came only after
the excellent 1983 and 1985 vintages. Pinot Noir is still Oregon’s flagship
wine, and a vast majority of the state’s wineries make this wine. Oregon’s
Pinot Noirs, with their characteristic black-fruit aromas and flavors, depth
and complexity, have won accolades as among the very best Pinots in the
United States.
Red wine encompasses 60 percent of Oregon’s wine production today; the
40 percent of production that is white wine features mainly Pinot Gris,
Chardonnay, and Riesling.
Oregon’s other Pinot
Because Chardonnay is the companion grape to Pinot Noir in France’s
Burgundy region (see Chapter 9), and because Chardonnay wine is hugely
popular in America, it’s an important variety in Oregon. However, a second
white grape variety has emerged to challenge Chardonnay’s domination:
Pinot Gris. A natural mutation of its ancestor, Pinot Noir, the Pinot Gris vari-
ety has grapes that are normally pale pink–yellowish in color when ripe.
David Lett, founder and winemaker of The Eyrie Vineyards and Oregon’s Pinot
Noir pioneer, is also the man who made Oregon’s first Pinot Gris around 1970,
followed by Ponzi Vineyards and Adelsheim Vineyards. Today, over 75 wineries
in Oregon make Pinot Gris.
252
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

Two styles of Oregon Pinot Gris exist:
 A lighter, fruity style (for which the grapes are picked early) is always
unoaked and can be consumed as soon as six to eight months after the
autumn harvest.
 A medium-bodied, golden-colored wine from grapes left longer on the
vine sometimes has a little oak aging and can age for five or six years
or longer.
In general Oregon Pinot Gris is light- to medium-bodied, with aromas reminis-
cent of pears, apples, and sometimes of melon, and surprising depth for an
inexpensive wine. It’s an excellent food wine, even when it’s slightly sweet;
it works well especially with seafood and salmon, just the kind of food that
it’s paired with in Oregon. And the best news is the price. Most of Oregon’s
Pinot Gris wines are in the $12 to $18 range in retail stores.
Now, more and more California wineries are also making Pinot Gris — but
in California, wineries are producing a lighter style, which they often call
by the Italian name, Pinot Grigio, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of
the Italian wine. Oregon’s richer Pinot Gris wines resemble Alsace’s flavorful
Pinot Gris style. In the year 2000, Pinot Gris overtook Chardonnay as Oregon’s
number-one white variety planted, and it now also outsells Oregon Chardonnay.
Who’s who in Willamette Valley
The main home of Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris in Oregon is the Willamette
(will AM ett) Valley, directly south of the city of Portland in northwest
Oregon. The cool Willamette Valley has established itself in the last 30 years
as the most important wine region in Oregon; in fact, over 200 wineries,
about two-thirds of the state’s wineries, are situated there.
Willamette Valley is a convenient wine destination to visit because the
vibrant city of Portland, with all its fine restaurants, hotels, and shops, is
30 minutes north of this wine region.
Willamette Valley is huge and encompasses several counties. Yamhill County,
directly southwest of Portland, has the greatest concentration of wineries, all of
which produce Pinot Noir. But quite a few wineries are located in Washington
County, west of Portland, and in Polk County, south of Yamhill. Six AVAs now
exist in the Willamette Valley: Chehalem Mountain, Dundee Hills, Yamhill-
Carlton District, Ribbon Ridge, McMinnville Foothills, and Eola Hills.
253

Two other Oregon wine regions
Two other wine regions of note in Oregon are both in the southwest part of
the state: the Umpqua Valley (around the town of Roseburg) and farther
south, next to California’s northern border, the Rogue River Valley.
Considerably warmer than Willamette, the Umpqua Valley is the site of
Oregon’s first winery, Hillcrest Vineyard, founded in 1962. The main grape
varieties in Umpqua are Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling, and Cabernet
Sauvignon. Major wineries are Henry Estate and Girardet Wine Cellars,
known for their Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
The Rogue River Valley is warmer still; therefore, Cabernet Sauvignon and
Merlot often perform better than Pinot Noir there. Chardonnay is the leading
white wine, but Pinot Gris is becoming popular. Bridgeview Vineyards, the
254
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

region’s largest winery, is doing an admirable job with Pinot Gris as well as
Pinot Noir. Four other vineyards to watch are Ashland Vineyards, Valley View
Winery, Sarah Powell Wines, and Foris Vineyards — the latter a specialist in
Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Wine on the Desert: Washington State
Although Washington and Oregon are neighboring states, their wine regions
have vastly different climates due to the location of the vineyards relative to
the Cascade Mountains, which cut through both states from north to south.
On Washington’s western, or coastal, side, the climate is maritime — cool,
plenty of rain, and a lot of vegetation. (In Oregon, almost all the vineyards are
located on the coastal side.) East of the mountains, Washington’s climate is
continental, with hot, very dry summers and cold winters. Most of Washington’s
vineyards are situated in this area, in the vast, sprawling Columbia and
Yakima Valleys. Because it’s so far north, Washington also has the advantage
of long hours of sunlight, averaging an unusually high 17.4 hours of sunshine
during the growing season.
Washington’s winemakers have found that with irrigation, many grapes can
flourish in the Washington desert. The Bordeaux varieties — Merlot, Cabernet
Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sauvignon Blanc, and Sémillon — are the name of
the game. Syrah is coming up fast, and Chenin Blanc and the ever-present
Chardonnay also are doing well.
Washington first became well-known for the quality of its Merlots. (One winery,
Columbia Crest, makes the largest-selling Merlot in the United States in the
over-$8 price category.) Lately, Washington’s Syrah wines are gaining many of
the accolades. In fact, Washington may be the single best region in the United
States for this exciting wine. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc are also
excellent varietal wines in Washington.
Washington does have a few vineyards west of the Cascades, around Puget
Sound, where Riesling and Gewürtztraminer grow well. In fact, many of the
larger wineries, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Winery, are
located in the Puget Sound area, near the thriving city of Seattle (but they
obtain almost all their grapes from the Columbia and Yakima Valleys). Running
a business is a bit easier in Seattle than in the desert! Chateau Ste. Michelle,
along with the even larger Columbia Crest (both under the same corporate
ownership), are the giants in the state; they account for over 50 percent of
all Washington’s wines at present. Two other large Washington wineries are
The Hogue Cellars and Washington Hills Cellars.
255
Chapter 13: America, America

Like Oregon, Washington got off to a late start in the wine business. With the
exception of Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Winery, both founded in the
1960s, practically none of the current wineries existed as late as 1980. In 1981,
Washington had 19 wineries; today, more than 400 wineries are in business,
making Washington the second-largest wine producer of premium wines in
the United States.
The types of wine produced in Washington have also dramatically changed
during the past decade. In 1993, about two thirds of Washington’s wines
were white, one third red. Reflecting Americans’ changing tastes in wine,
Washington’s wines are now about 60 percent red, 40 percent white.
Washington’s wine regions
Washington has one gigantic AVA, Columbia Valley, which encompasses five
other AVAs within its macro-appellation (listed in order of their general
importance):
 Yakima Valley: This region is the second largest in acreage, behind the
huge Columbia Valley itself; more wineries are actually located here than
in the rest of Columbia Valley.
 Walla Walla Valley: Although only 5 percent of the state’s vinifera
grapes grow here, this fast-growing region in the southeast corner of
Washington is home to some of the state’s top wineries, such as Leonetti
Cellar, Woodward Canyon, Waterbrook Winery, Canoe Ridge Vineyard,
and L’Ecole # 41.
 Red Mountain: A relatively new (2001) AVA, the tiny Red Mountain area
is actually within the Yakima Valley AVA, but its red clay soil and high
altitude earned it a separate appellation. About nine wineries, including
Hedges and Kiona Vineyards, concentrate on red varieties: Cabernet
Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Syrah. Some great vineyards are
also located here.
 Horse Heaven Hills: Recognized as a separate AVA in 2005, this area in
the southernmost part of the Columbia Valley, just north of the Columbia
River, has long been known as an ideal location for Cabernet Sauvignon.
Many of Washington’s leading wineries, including Chateau Ste. Michelle,
use grapes from vineyards here.
 Wahluke Slope: A brand-new (2006) AVA, the Wahluke Slope is one of
the state’s warmer appellations, known for its Merlot and Cabernet
Sauvignon, and home to Snoqualmie Vineyards.
256
Part IV: Discovering the New World of Wine 

Other AVAs include tiny Rattlesnake Hills, a sub-appellation of Yakima Valley,
and Columbia Gorge, a beautiful area in southwest Washington crossing into
Oregon, which actually has an equal number of both Oregon and Washington
wineries. The Lake Chelan Region, in Northern Columbia Valley, with 12 winer-
ies, has been proposed as an AVA. More than 50 wineries are located in the
Greater Puget Sound/Seattle Area AVA, which encompasses the Puget Sound
Islands; in this cool, moist climate, Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir are leading vari-
eties, as well as Riesling and Gewürztraminer. About nine wineries, including
Arbor Crest, are located in the Spokane Area in eastern Washington.

A Washington oddity
When was the last time you had a Lemberger? No,
we don’t mean the cheese! Lemberger is a little-
known grape variety from Germany that’s also
grown in Austria, where it’s called Blaufränkisch.
Don’t feel bad if you haven’t heard of it, because
few people in the United States — outside of
Washington — have tasted it. Lemberger is a
hardy red variety that does well in the Yakima
Valley; it makes a fruity but dry, inexpensive
wine in the Beaujolais or Dolcetto school.
Hoodsport, Covey Run, Kiona Vineyards, and
Hogue Cellars are four good producers of
Lemberger — the wine! Hogue Cellars calls
their version “Blue Franc.”

The Empire State
New York City may be the capital of the world in many ways, but its state’s
wines don’t get the recognition they deserve, perhaps because of California’s
overwhelming presence in the U.S. market. New York ranks as the third
largest wine producing state in the United States. Brotherhood America’s
Oldest Winery, Ltd., the oldest continuously operating winery in the United
States, opened its doors in New York’s Hudson Valley in 1839. And the largest
wine company in the world, Constellation, has its headquarters in the Finger
Lakes region of western New York.
Upstate, downstate
New York’s most important region is the Finger Lakes, where four large lakes
temper the otherwise cool climate. This AVA produces about two-thirds of
New York’s wines. The other two important regions are the Hudson Valley,
along the Hudson River north of New York City, and Long Island, which has
three AVAs: North Fork of Long Island (the most important); the Hamptons,
on the island’s South Fork; and Long Island itself, using grapes from all over
Long Island.
In the early days (prior to 1960), most of New York’s wines were made from
native American varieties, such as Concord, Catawba, Delaware, and Niagara,
as well French-American hybrid grapes such as Seyval Blanc, Baco Noir, and
Maréchal Foch.
259
Chapter 13: America, America

Common wisdom held that the relatively cold New York winters could not
support Vitis vinifera varieties. But a Russian immigrant, the late, great
Dr. Konstantin Frank, proved all the naysayers wrong when he succeeded
in growing Riesling (followed by many other vinifera varieties) in 1953 in
Hammondsport, in the Finger Lakes region. (The first wines from vinifera
grapes were actually made in 1961 at his winery, Dr. Frank’s Vinifera Wine
Cellars.) His son, Willy Frank, who recently passed away, ran one of the most
successful wineries in the state, with an entire line of fine vinifera wines and
excellent sparkling wines; the winery carries on today under the leadership
of Dr. Franks’s grandson, Fred.
In 1973, Alec and Louisa Hargrave got the idea that Long Island’s North Fork
(about a two-hour drive east of New York City) had the ideal climate and soil
for vinifera grapes. Today, Long Island has 32 wineries and is still growing.
Like Washington state, Long Island seems particularly suited to Merlot, but
Chardonnay, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Sauvignon
Blanc are also grown, plus some Gewürztraminer, Pinot Noir, and numerous
other varieties.

Oh, Canada
Ask many wine lovers in the United States about Canadian wines, and you’ll
probably get a blank stare in response. Canada’s wines are known mainly to
Canadians, who consume the bulk of their country’s production.
The 1990s brought incredible growth to the Canadian wine industry: The
number of wineries grew from 30 to over 400 today. Wine is made in four of
Canada’s provinces, but Ontario has bragging rights as the largest producer,
with over 100 wineries. British Columbia ranks second. Quebec and Nova
Scotia also produce wine.
To identify and promote wines made entirely from local grapes (some Canadian
wineries import wines from other countries to blend with local production),
the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia have established an appella-
tion system called VQA, Vintners’ Quality Alliance. This system regulates the
use of provincial names on wine labels, establishes which grape varieties can
be used (vinifera varieties and certain hybrids), regulates the use of the
terms icewine, late harvest, and botrytised (see Chapter 11 for an explanation
of these terms), and requires wines to pass a taste and laboratory test.
Ontario
Ontario’s vineyards are cool-climate wine zones, despite the fact that they lie
on the same parallel as Chianti Classico and Rioja, warmer European wine
regions discussed in Chapters 10 and 14. Sixty percent of the production is
white wine, from Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Pinot Blanc, Auxerrois,
and the hybrids Seyval Blanc and Vidal. Red wines come from Pinot Noir,
Gamay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and the hybrids Maréchal
Foch and Baco Noir.
261
Chapter 13: America, America

Ontario’s VQA rules permit the use of the appellation Ontario and also recog-
nize three Designated Viticultural Areas (DVAs), listed in order of importance:
 Niagara Peninsula: Along the south shore of Lake Ontario
 Pelee Island: Eleven miles south of the Canadian mainland, in Lake Erie,
Canada’s most southerly vineyards
 Lake Erie North Shore: The warmest of Ontario’s viticultural areas
Because winter temperatures regularly drop well below freezing, icewine,
made from grapes naturally frozen on the vine, is a specialty of Ontario. 
It is gradually earning the Canadian wine industry international attention,
particularly for the wines of Inniskillin Winery. VQA regulations are particu-
larly strict regarding icewine production, as it has developed into the leader
of the Canadian wine exports.
British Columbia
The rapidly growing wine industry of British Columbia now boasts more
than 70 wineries. Production is mainly white wine — from Chardonnay,
Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, and Riesling — but red wine produc-
tion is increasing, mainly from Pinot Noir and Merlot.
The Okanagan Valley in southeast British Columbia, where the climate is
influenced by Lake Okanagan, is the center of wine production; Misssion Hill
is a leading winery. VQA rules recognize five Designated Viticultural Areas,
listed in order of importance:
 Okanagan Valley
 Similkameen Valley
 Fraser Valley
 Vancouver Island
 Gulf Islands

n the universe of wine, sparkling wines are a solar system unto them-
selves. They’re produced in just about every country that makes wine, and
they come in a wide range of tastes, quality levels, and prices. Champagne,
the sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France, is the brightest star
in the sky, but by no means the only one.
Sparkling wines are distinguished (and distinguishable) from other wines by
the presence of bubbles — carbon dioxide — in the wine. In the eyes of most
governments, these bubbles must be a natural by-product of fermentation in
order for a wine to be officially considered a sparkling wine.
In many wine regions, sparkling wines are just a sideline to complement the
region’s table wine production, but in some places, sparkling wines are seri-
ous business. At the top of that list is France’s Champagne region (where
sparkling wine was — if not invented — made famous). Italy’s Asti wine zone
is another important region, as is France’s Loire Valley, northeastern Spain,
and parts of California. Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are also now
making some interesting sparklers.

All That Glitters Is Not Champagne
Champagne, the sparkling wine of Champagne, France, is the gold standard of
sparkling wines for a number of reasons:
 Champagne is the most famous sparkling wine in the world; the name
has immediate recognition with everyone, not just wine drinkers.
 A particular technique for making sparkling wine was perfected in the
Champagne region.
 Champagne is not only the finest sparkling wine in the world, but also
among the finest wines in the world of any type.
Within the European Union, only the wines of the Champagne region in
France can use the name Champagne. Elsewhere, because of Champagne’s
fame, the name champagne appears on labels of all sorts of sparkling wines
that don’t come from the Champagne region and that don’t taste like
Champagne. Wineries call their bubbly wines “champagne” to make them
more marketable, and despite tighter regulations regarding the use of the
term, many wineries in the United States may still use “champagne” on their
labels. Many wine drinkers also use the word “champagne” indiscriminately
to refer to all wines that have bubbles.
Ironically, much of the sparkling wine sold in the United States that’s called
“champagne” is not even made with the same techniques as true Champagne.
Most imitation champagnes are made by a technique that takes only a few
months from beginning to end (compared to a few years to make Champagne),
is less costly, and works more effectively on an industrial scale.
Whenever we use the word Champagne, we are referring to true Champagne,
from the region of the same name; we use the generic term sparkling wine to
refer to bubbly wines collectively, and sparkling wines other than Champagne.

Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 
The cool rule
Many sparkling wine regions are very cool
areas, where grapes don’t ripen sufficiently for
still (non-sparkling) wine production. Vinified
normally, the wines of these regions would be
extremely high in acid, disagreeably tart, and
very thin; the reds would lack color. But the
elaborate process of sparkling wine production
(the traditional method of production as prac-
ticed in the Champagne region, and described
later in this chapter) turns the climate’s deficits
into virtues, and transforms the ugly duckling
grapes into graceful swans.

Sparkling Wine Styles
All sparkling wines have bubbles, and nearly all of them are either white or
pink (which is far less common than white). That’s about as far as broad gen-
eralizations take us in describing sparkling wines.
Some sparkling wines are downright sweet, some are bone dry, and many fall
somewhere in the middle, from medium-dry to medium-sweet. Some have
toasty, nutty flavors and some are fruity; among those that are fruity, some
are just nondescriptly grapey, while others have delicate nuances of lemons,
apples, cherries, berries, peaches, and other fruits.
The sparkling wines of the world fall into two broad styles, according to how
they’re made, and how they taste as a result:
 Wines that express the character of their grapes; these wines tend to be
fruity and straightforward, without layers of complexity.
 Wines that express complexity and flavors (yeasty, biscuity, caramel-like,
honeyed) that derive from winemaking and aging, rather than expressing
overt fruitiness.
How sweet is it?
Nearly all sparkling wines are not technically dry, because they contain mea-
surable but small amounts of sugar, usually as the result of sweetening added
at the last stage of production. But all sparkling wines don’t necessarily taste
sweet. The perception of sweetness depends on two factors: the actual amount
of sweetness in the wine (which varies according to the wine’s style) and the
wine’s balance between acidity and sweetness.
Here’s how the balance factor operates. Sparkling wines are usually very high
in acidity, because the grapes, having grown in a cool climate, weren’t particu-
larly ripe at harvest. The wine’s carbon dioxide also gives an acidic impression
in the mouth. But the wine’s sweetness counterbalances its acidity and vice
versa. Depending on the actual amount of sugar and the particular acid/sugar
balance a sparkling wine strikes, the wine may taste dry, very slightly sweet,
medium sweet, or quite sweet.
Champagne itself is made in a range of sweetness levels, the most common
of which is a dry style called brut (see “Sweetness categories” later in this
chapter). Sparkling wines made by the traditional method used in Champagne
(see “How Sparkling Wine Happens” later in this chapter) are made in the
same range of styles as Champagne.
267
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

Inexpensive sparkling wines tend to be medium sweet in order to appeal to
a mass market that enjoys sweetness. Wines labeled with the Italian word
spumante tend to be overtly sweet. (See the section “Italian spumante:
Sweet or dry,” later in this chapter.)
How good is it?
When you taste a sparkling wine, the most important consideration is whether
you like it — just as for a still wine. If you want to evaluate a sparkling wine
the way professionals do, however, you have to apply a few criteria that don’t
apply to still wines (or are less critical in still wines than in sparkling wines).
Some of those criteria are
 The appearance of the bubbles. In the best sparkling wines, the bubbles
are tiny and float upward in a continuous stream from the bottom of
your glass. If the bubbles are large and random, you have a clue that the
wine is a lesser-quality sparkler. If you don’t see many bubbles at all, you
could have a bad bottle, a poor or smudged glass, or a wine that may be
too old.
Tiny variations in glassware can drastically affect the flow of bubbles.
If the wine in your glass looks almost flat, but another glass of wine from
the same bottle is lively with bubbles, blame the glass and not the wine.
(In this case, you should be able to taste the bubbles, even if you can’t see
many of them.) See Chapter 8 for our recommendations about glasses
for Champagne and other sparkling wines.
 The feel of the bubbles in your mouth. The finer the wine, the less
aggressive the bubbles feel in your mouth. (If the bubbles remind you
of a soft drink, we hope you didn’t pay more than $5 for the wine.)
 The balance between sweetness and acidity. Even if a bubbly wine is
too sweet or too dry for your taste, to evaluate its quality you should
consider its sweetness/acid ratio and decide whether these two elements
seem reasonably balanced.
 The texture. Traditional-method sparkling wines should be somewhat
creamy in texture as a result of their extended lees aging. (See the next
section for an explanation of traditional method and lees.)
 The finish. Any impression of bitterness on the finish of a sparkling wine
is a sign of low quality.

How Sparkling Wine Happens
When yeasts convert sugar into alcohol, carbon dioxide is a natural by-product.
If fermentation takes place in a closed container, that prevents this carbon
dioxide from escaping into the air, the wine becomes sparkling. With nowhere
else to go, the carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes trapped in the wine in the form
of bubbles.
Most sparkling wines actually go through two fermentations: one to turn the
grape juice into still wine without bubbles (that’s called a base wine) and a
subsequent one to turn the base wine into bubbly wine (conveniently called
the second fermentation). The winemaker has to instigate the second fermen-
tation by adding yeasts and sugar to the base wine. The added yeasts convert
the added sugar into alcohol and CO2 bubbles.
Beginning with the second fermentation, the longer and slower the winemak-
ing process, the more complex and expensive the sparkling wine will be.
Some sparkling wines are ten years in the making; others are produced in
only a few months. The slow-route wines can cost more than $100 a bottle,
while bubblies at the opposite end of the spectrum can sell for as little as $4.
Although many variations exist, most sparkling wines are produced in one
of two ways: through second fermentation in a tank, or through second 
fermentation in a bottle.
Tank fermentation: Economy of scale
The quickest, most efficient way of making a sparkling wine involves conduct-
ing the second fermentation in large, closed, pressurized tanks. This method
is called the bulk method, tank method, cuve close (meaning closed tank in
French), or charmat method (after a Frenchman named Eugene Charmat, who
championed this process).
Sparkling wines made in the charmat (pronounced shar mah) method are
usually the least expensive. That’s because they’re usually made in large
quantities and they’re ready for sale soon after harvest. Also, the grapes used
in making sparkling wine by the charmat method (Chenin Blanc, for example)
are usually far less expensive than the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay typically
used in the traditional or champagne method described in the next section.
269
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

The following occurs in the charmat method:
 A base wine is seeded with sugar and yeast, and it ferments. The carbon
dioxide created by the fermentation becomes trapped in the wine, thanks
to the closed tank, pressure within the tank, and cold temperature.
 The wine — now a dry sparkling wine with higher alcohol than the base
wine had — is filtered (under pressure) to remove the solid deposits
(the lees) from the second fermentation.
 Before bottling, some sweetness is added to adjust the wine’s flavor,
according to the desired style of the final wine.
The whole process can take just a few weeks. In some exceptional cases, it may
be extended to a few months, allowing the wine to rest between the fermenta-
tion and the filtration.
Bottle fermentation: Small is beautiful
The charmat method is a fairly new way of producing sparkling wines,
dating back barely 100 years. The more traditional method is to conduct
the second fermentation in the individual bottles in which the wine is
later sold.
Champagne has been made in this way for over 300 years and, according to
French regulations, can be made in no other way. Many other French sparkling
wines produced outside of the Champagne region use the same process but
are allowed to use the term crémant in their names rather than champagne.
The best sparkling wines from Spain, California, and elsewhere also use
Champagne’s traditional method.
The technique of conducting the second fermentation in the bottle is called
the classic or traditional method in Europe; in the United States, it’s called the
champagne method or méthode champenoise.
Bottle fermentation (or, more correctly, second fermentation in the bottle) is
an elaborate process in which every single bottle becomes an individual fer-
mentation tank, so to speak. Including the aging time at the winery before the
wine is sold, this process requires a minimum of fifteen months and usually
takes three years or more. Invariably, bottle-fermented sparkling wines are
more expensive than tank-fermented bubblies.
The elements of bottle fermentation are as follows:
270
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

 Each bottle is filled with a mixture of base wine and a sugar-and-yeast
solution, closed securely, and laid to rest in a cool, dark cellar.
 The second fermentation slowly occurs inside each bottle, producing
carbon dioxide and fermentation lees.
 As the bottles lie in the cellar, the interaction of the lees and the wine
gradually changes the wine’s texture and flavor.
 Eventually — 12 months to several years after the second fermentation —
the bottles undergo a process of shaking and turning so that the lees fall
to the neck of each upside-down bottle.
 The lees are flash-frozen in the neck of each bottle and expelled from the
bottle as a frozen plug, leaving clear sparkling wine behind.
 A sweetening solution (called a dosage) is added to each bottle to adjust
the flavor of the wine, and the bottles are corked and labeled for sale.
Actually, the classic method as practiced in Champagne involves several
processes that occur way before the second fermentation. For example, the
pressing to extract the juice from the grapes must be gentle and meticulous to
prevent the grapeskins’ bitter flavors — and their color, in the case of black
grapes — from passing into the juice. Another step crucially important to the
quality of the sparkling wine is blending various wines after the first fermen-
tation to create the best composite base wine for the second fermentation.
After the first fermentation, each Champagne house has hundreds of different
still wines, because the winemaker keeps the wines of different grape varieties
and different vineyards separate. To create his base wine, or cuvée, he blends
these wines in varying proportions, often adding some reserve wine (older wine
purposely held back from previous vintages). More than 100 different wines can
go into a single base wine, each bringing its own special character to the blend.
What’s particularly tricky about blending the base wine — besides the sheer
number of components in the blend — is that the winemaker has to see into
the future and create a blend not for its flavor today but for how it will taste
in several years, after it has been transformed into a sparkling wine. The men
and women who blend sparkling wines are true artists of the wine world.
Taste: The proof of the pudding
Tank-fermented sparklers tend to be fruitier than traditional-method
sparkling wines. This difference occurs because in tank fermentation, the
route from grape to wine is shorter and more direct than in bottle fermenta-
tion. Some winemakers use the charmat, or tank, method because their goal
271
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

is a fresh and fruity sparkling wine. Asti, Italy’s most famous sparkling wine,
is a perfect example. You should drink charmat-method sparklers young,
when their fruitiness is at its max.
Second fermentation in the bottle makes wines that tend to be less overtly
fruity than charmat-method wines. Chemical changes that take place as the
wine develops on its fermentation lees diminish the fruitiness of the wine and
contribute aromas and flavors such as toastiness, nuttiness, caramel, and
yeastiness. The texture of the wine can also change, becoming smooth and
creamy. The bubbles themselves tend to be tinier, and they feel less aggres-
sive in your mouth than the bubbles of tank-fermented wines.
Champagne and Its Magic Wines
Champagne. Does any other word convey such a sense of celebration? Think
of it: Whenever people, in any part of the world, want to celebrate, you may
hear them say, “This calls for Champagne!” (“This calls for iced tea!” just isn’t
quite the same.)
Champagne, the real thing, comes only from the region of Champagne (sham
pahn yah) in northeast France. Dom Pérignon, the famous monk who was
cellar master at the Abbey of Hautvillers, didn’t invent Champagne, but he did
achieve several breakthroughs that are key to the production of Champagne
as we now know it. He perfected the method of making white wine from black
grapes, for example, and, most importantly, he mastered the art of blending
wines from different grapes and different villages to achieve a complex base
wine. (See the previous section to find out what “base” wine is.)
Champagne is the most northerly vineyard area in France. Most of the impor-
tant Champagne houses (as Champagne producers are called) are located in
the cathedral city of Rheims (French spelling, Reims) — where 17-year-old
Joan of Arc had Prince Charles crowned King of France in 1429 — and in the
town of Epernay, south of Rheims. Around Rheims and Epernay are the main
vineyard areas, where three permitted grape varieties for Champagne flourish.
These areas are
 The Montagne de Reims (south of Rheims), where the best Pinot Noir
grows
 The Côte des Blancs (south of Epernay), home of the best Chardonnay
 The Valleé de la Marne (west of Epernay), most favorable to Pinot Meunier
(a black grape) although all three grape varieties grow there
272
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

Most Champagne is made from all three grape varieties — two black and one
white. Pinot Noir contributes body, structure, and longevity to the blend;
Pinot Meunier provides precocity, floral aromas, and fruitiness; and
Chardonnay offers delicacy, freshness, and elegance.
What makes Champagne special
The cool climate in Champagne is marginal for grape growing, and the grapes
struggle to ripen sufficiently in some years. Even in warmer years, the climate
dictates that the grapes are high in acidity — a sorry state for table wine but
perfect for sparkling wine. The cool climate and the region’s chalky, limestone
soil are the leading factors contributing to Champagne’s excellence.
Three other elements help distinguish Champagne from all other sparkling
wines:
 The number and diversity of vineyards (over 300 crus, or individual 
vineyards), which provide a huge range of unique wines for blending
 The cold, deep, chalky cellars — many built during Roman times — in
which Champagnes age for many years
 The 300 years of experience the Champenois (as the good citizens of
Champagne are called) have in making sparkling wine
The result is an elegant sparkling wine with myriad tiny, gentle bubbles, com-
plexity of flavors, and a lengthy finish. Voilá! Champagne!
Non-vintage Champagne
Non-vintage (NV) Champagne — any Champagne without a vintage year on the
label — accounts for 85 percent of all Champagne. Its typical blend is two-thirds
black grapes (Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier) and one-third white (Chardonnay).
Wine from three or more harvests usually goes into the blend. And remember,
the wines from 30 or 40 different villages (or more) from each year can also be
part of the blend. The Champagne winemaker is by necessity a master blender.
Each Champagne house blends to suit its own house style for its non-vintage
Champagne. (For example, one house may seek elegance and finesse in its
wine, another may opt for fruitiness, and a third may value body, power, and
longevity.) Maintaining a consistent house style is vital because wine drinkers
get accustomed to their favorite Champagne’s taste and expect to find it year
after year.
273
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

Most major Champagne houses age their non-vintage Champagne for two and
a half to three years before selling it, even though the legal minimum for non-
vintage is just 15 months. The extra aging prolongs the marrying time for the
blend and enhances the wine’s flavor and complexity. If you have good storage
conditions (see Chapter 16), aging your non-vintage Champagne for one to
three years after you purchase it usually improves the flavor, in our opinion.
Most non-vintage Champagnes sell for $25 to $50 a bottle. Often, a large
retailer buys huge quantities of a few major brands, obtaining a good dis-
count that he passes on to his customers. Seeking out stores that do a 
large-volume business in Champagne is worth your while.
Vintage Champagne
Historically, only in about five of every ten years has the weather in
Champagne been good enough to make a Vintage Champagne — that is, the
grapes were ripe enough that some wine could be made entirely from the
grapes of that year without being blended with reserve wines from previous
years. Since 1995, the climate in Champagne (and throughout Europe) has
been much warmer than normal, and Champagne producers have been able
to make Vintage Champagne almost every year. (2001 was the one exception).
Even in the 1980s, Champagne had exceptionally good weather; many houses
made Vintage Champagne every year from 1981 to 1990, with the exception
of 1984 and 1987. The early ’90s were more typical; four years — 1991, 1992,
1993, and 1994 — were unremarkable, and few producers made vintage-dated
Champagne.
The Champagne region has had a string of really fine vintages since 1995,
especially the 1996 vintage. The three years that followed — 1997, 1998, and
1999 — all have been good. Both 2000 and 2003 were no more than average
(too hot, especially 2003), but 2002 and 2004 are fine vintages (with 2002 the
best since 1996), and 2005 is variable. Champagne lovers should seek out
1996 Vintage Champagnes; 1996 is exceptional, one of the best long-lived 
vintages ever!
Champagne houses decide for themselves each year whether to make a
Vintage Champagne. Factors that might come into consideration — besides
the quality of the vintage — include the need to save some wine instead to
use as reserve wines for their non-vintage Champagnes (85 percent of their
business, after all), and/or whether a particular vintage’s style suits the
“house style.” For example, although 1989 was a rather good vintage, a few
houses decided that Champagnes made from this vintage would be too soft
(low in acidity) and/or too precocious (lacking longevity) for them, and did
not choose to make a Vintage Champagne in 1989.
274
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

The minimum aging requirement for Vintage Champagne is three years, but
many houses age their Vintage Champagnes four to six years in order to
enhance the wines’ flavor and complexity. Vintage Champagnes fall into
two categories:
 Regular vintage, with a price range of $45 to $70 a bottle; these wines
simply carry a vintage date in addition to the name of the house.
 Premium vintage (also known as a prestige cuvée or tête de cuvée),
such as Moët & Chandon’s Dom Pérignon, Roederer’s Cristal, or Veuve
Clicquot’s La Grande Dame; the typical price for prestige cuvées ranges
from $75 to $150 per bottle, with a few even more expensive.
Vintage Champagne is almost always superior to non-vintage for the follow-
ing reasons:
 The best grapes from the choicest vineyards are put into Vintage
Champagne (this is especially so for prestige cuvées).
 Usually, only the two finest varieties (Pinot Noir and Chardonnay) are
used in Vintage Champagne. Pinot Meunier is saved mainly for non-
vintage Champagne.
 Most Champagne houses age Vintage Champagnes at least two years more
than their non-vintage wines. The extra aging assures more complexity.
 The grapes all come from a year that’s above average, at least — or
superb, at best.
Vintage Champagne is more intense in flavor than non-vintage Champagne.
It is typically fuller-bodied and more complex, and its flavors last longer in
your mouth. Being fuller and richer, these Champagnes are best with food.
Non-vintage Champagnes — usually lighter, fresher, and less complicated —
are suitable as apéritifs, and they are good values. Whether a Vintage
Champagne is worth its extra cost or not is a judgment you have to make
for yourself.
275
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers
Refrigerator blues
Don’t leave your Champagne — or any other
good sparkling wine — in your refrigerator for
more than a week! Its flavor will become flat from
the excessively cold temperature. Also, long-term
vibrations caused by the cycling on and off of the
refrigerator motor are not good for any wine —
especially sparkling wine. (See Chapter 16 for
more on storing your wine properly.)

Blanc de blancs and blanc de noirs
A small number of Champagnes derive only from Chardonnay; that type of
Champagne is called blanc de blancs — literally, “white (wine) from white
(grapes).” A blanc de blancs can be a Vintage Champagne or a non-vintage.
It usually costs a few dollars more than other Champagnes in its category.
Because they are generally lighter and more delicate than other Champagnes,
blanc de blancs make ideal apéritifs. Not every Champagne house makes a
blanc de blancs. Four of the best all-Vintage Champagnes, are Taittinger
Comte de Champagne, Billecart-Salmon Blanc de Blancs, Deutz Blanc de
Blancs, and Pol Roger Blanc de Chardonnay.
Blanc de noirs Champagne (made entirely from black grapes, often just
Pinot Noir) is rare but does exist. Bollinger’s Blanc de Noirs Vieilles Vignes
Francaises (“old vines”) is absolutely the best, but it is very expensive
($400 to$450) and hard to find. The 1985 Bollinger Blanc de Noirs is one
of the two best Champagnes we’ve ever had; the other is the 1928 Krug.
Rosé Champagne
Rosé Champagnes — pink Champagnes — can also be vintage or non-vintage.
Usually, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are the only grapes used, in proportions
that vary from one house to the next.
Winemakers create a rosé Champagne usually by including some red Pinot
Noir wine in the blend for the base wine. A few actually vinify some of their
red grapes into pink wines, the way that you would make a rosé still wine,
and use that as the base wine. Colors vary quite a lot, from pale onion-skin to
salmon to rosy pink. (The lighter-colored ones are usually dryer.)
Rosés are fuller and rounder than other Champagnes and are best enjoyed
with dinner. (Because they have become associated with romance, they’re
popular choices for wedding anniversaries and Valentine’s Day.)
276
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 
Who’s drinking Champagne
Not surprisingly, France leads the world in
Champagne consumption, drinking 58 percent of
all the Champagne produced. The United Kingdom
is the leading foreign market for Champagne.
The United States is second, and Germany is
third, followed by Belgium and Italy. But the United
States buys the most prestige cuvée Champagne,
especially Dom Pérignon.

Like blanc de blancs Champagnes, rosés usually cost a few dollars more than
regular Champagnes, and not every Champagne house makes one. Some of
the best rosés are those of Roederer, Billecart-Salmon, Gosset, and Moët &
Chandon (especially its Dom Pérignon Rosé).
For some people, rosé Champagne has a bad connotation because of the
tons of sweet, insipid, cheap pink wines — sparkling and otherwise — on the
market. But rosé Champagne is just as dry and has the same high quality as
regular (white) Champagne.
Sweetness categories
Champagnes always carry an indication of their sweetness on the label, but
the words used to indicate sweetness are cryptic: extra dry is not really dry,
for example. In ascending order of sweetness, Champagnes are labeled
 Extra brut, brut nature, or brut sauvage: Totally dry
 Brut: Dry
 Extra dry: Medium dry
 Sec: Slightly sweet
 Demi-sec: Fairly sweet
 Doux: Sweet
The most popular style for Champagne and other serious bubblies is brut.
However, the single best-selling Champagne in the United States, Moët &
Chandon’s White Star, actually is an extra dry Champagne. Brut, extra dry,
and demi-sec are the three types of Champagne you find almost exclusively
nowadays.
Recommended Champagne producers
The Champagne business — especially the export end of it — is dominated
by about 25 or 30 large houses, most of whom purchase from independent
growers the majority of grapes they need to make their Champagne. Of the
major houses, only Roederer and Bollinger own a substantial portion of the
vineyards from which they get their grapes — a definite economic and quality-
control advantage for them.
277

Madame Lily Bollinger’s advice 
on drinking Champagne
When Jacques Bollinger died in 1941, his widow,
Lily Bollinger, carried her famous Champagne
house through the difficult years of the German
occupation of France. She ran the company until
her death in 1977. Bollinger prospered under her
leadership, doubling in size. She was a beloved
figure in Champagne, where she could be seen
bicycling through the vineyards every day. In 1961,
when a London reporter asked her when she
drank Champagne, Madame Bollinger replied:
“I only drink Champagne when I’m happy, and
when I’m sad. Sometimes I drink it when I’m
alone. When I have company I consider it oblig-
atory. I trifle with it if I am not hungry and drink
it when I am. Otherwise I never touch it — unless
I’m thirsty.”
The redoubtable Madame Lily Bollinger died at
the age of 78, apparently none the worse for all
that Champagne.

Other Sparkling Wines
Wineries all over the world have emulated Champagne by adopting the tech-
niques used in the Champagne region. Their wines differ from Champagne,
however, because their grapes grow in terroirs different from that of the
Champagne region and because, in some cases, their grapes are different
varieties.
279
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

Still other sparkling wines are made by using the tank fermentation rather
than the bottle fermentation method specifically to attain a certain style, or
to reduce production costs.
French sparkling wine
France makes many other sparkling wines besides Champagne, especially in
the Loire Valley, around Saumur, and in the regions of Alsace and Burgundy.
Sparkling wine made by the traditional method (second fermentation in the
bottle) often carries the name Crémant, as in Crémant d’Alsace, Crémant de
Loire, Crémant de Bourgogne, and so on. Grape varieties are those typical of
each region (see Chapter 9).
Some of the leading brands of French sparkling wines are Langlois-Château,
Bouvet Ladubay, Gratien & Meyer (all from the Loire Valley), Brut d’Argent,
Kriter, and Saint Hilaire. These wines sell for $10 to $15 and are decent. They’re
perfect for parties and other large gatherings, when you may want to serve a
French bubbly without paying a Champagne price. For more info on French
sparkling wines, take a look at our book French Wine For Dummies (Wiley).
American sparkling wine
Almost as many states make sparkling wine as make still wine, but California
and New York are the most famous for it. Two fine producers of New York State
sparkling wines in the traditional method are Chateau Frank and Lamoreaux
Landing, both under $20.
One sparkling wine, Gruet, deserves special mention because it hails, improb-
ably, from New Mexico. Owned by France’s little-known Champagne Gruet,
the New Mexican winery makes three excellent bubblies: a NV Brut and NV
Blanc de Noirs, both about $18, and a Vintage Blanc de Blancs, $24.
California bubbly is definitely a different wine from Champagne and tastes
fruitier even when made by a Champagne house, using the same methods
and the same grape varieties as in Champagne. Good California sparkling
wines, the ones made in the traditional Champagne method, cost as little as
$15 on up to $40 or more.
Most of California’s finest sparkling wines do not call themselves Champagne,
but the less-expensive, best-selling ones do. In that second category, Korbel,
at about $15, is the only brand that is actually fermented in the bottle.

Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

We recommend the following California sparkling wine producers, listed in
our rough order of preference within each category:
U.S.-owned
 Iron Horse: In Green Valley, the coolest part of Sonoma (temperature-
wise, that is), Iron Horse is clearly making some of California’s finest
sparkling wine. Look for its better cuvées, such as the Wedding Cuvée,
Russian Cuvée, and Vrai Amis, for about $25. Iron Horse’s top-of-the-line
sparkler, the Late Disgorged Blanc de Blancs, is truly superb, compara-
ble in quality to fine Champagne; it’s about $45.
 J: Not content with making some of America’s most popular Cabernet
Sauvignons and Chardonnays, the Jordan winery in Sonoma now also
makes one of the best sparkling wines in the country. Almost all its
grapes come from the cool Russian River Valley. Quite fruity and fairly
delicate, the wine comes in a knockout bottle and sells for about $30.
 S. Anderson: In Napa Valley, S. Anderson continues to produce one of
the finest lines of sparkling wines in the U.S. for about $25 to $30; look
especially for its Blanc de Noirs.
 Handley Cellars: Up in Anderson Valley in Mendocino County, Milla
Handley makes some excellent, quite dry sparkling wines; her Rosé Brut
is a beauty, at about $25.
French- or Spanish-owned
 Roederer Estate: Louis Roederer is such a fine Champagne house that
we’re not surprised at the smashing success that its Anderson Valley
winery, near the town of Mendocino, has achieved. Some critics think
it’s California’s best. Wines include a good-value Brut ($24), a delicate
rosé ($30) that’s worth seeking out, and outstanding premium cuvées,
L’Ermitage and L’Ermitage Rosé ($45).
 Mumm Cuvée Napa: Mumm has established itself as one of California’s
best sparkling wine houses. Much of its production comes from the
cool Carneros District; look especially for the Winery Lake Brut and the
cherry-like Blanc de Noirs. The price range is $25 to $30.
 Domaine Carneros: Taittinger’s California winery makes an elegant,
high-quality brut ($24 to $26) in cool Carneros. Its premium cuvée,
Le Rêve, a $50 blanc de blancs, is stunning.
 Domaine Chandon: This Napa Valley winery is part of the Moët & Chandon
empire. A must-stop for its restaurant alone, Chandon continues to make
solid, consistent sparkling wines at reasonable prices ($15 to $18). Look
especially for its premium Etoile (about $35), one of the most elegant
sparkling wines in the United States, and the delicious Etoile Rosé ($38).
281
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

 Gloria Ferrer: Spain’s Freixenet has built a beautiful winery in windswept
Carneros. Most of its wines are priced right ($18 to $25) and are widely
available. The winery is definitely worth a visit.
 Scharffenberger: From the cool Anderson Valley, Scharffenberger, now
owned by Champagne Louis Roederer, makes a Chardonnay-based Brut
that’s especially fine ($18 to $20).
Italian spumante: Sweet or dry
Spumante is simply the Italian word for “sparkling.” It often appears on bot-
tles of American wines that are sweet, fruity spin-offs of Italy’s classic Asti
Spumante. Actually, Italy makes many fine, dry spumante wines and a popular,
slightly sparkling wine called Prosecco, as well as sweet spumante. For more
info on Italian sparkling wines, check out our book Italian Wine For Dummies
(Wiley).
Asti and Moscato d’Asti
Asti is a delicious, fairly sweet, exuberantly fruity sparkling wine made in the
Piedmont region from Moscato grapes, via the tank method. It’s one bubbly
that you can drink with dessert (fantastic with wedding cake!).
Because freshness is essential in Asti, buy a good brand that sells well. 
(Asti is not vintage-dated, and so there’s no other way to determine how old
the wine is.) We recommend Fontanafredda (about $14 to $15), Martini &
Rossi ($12), and Cinzano (about $10).
For Asti flavor with fewer bubbles, try Moscato d’Asti, a delicate and deli-
cious medium-dry vintage-dated frizzante (slightly sparkling) wine that makes
a refreshing apéritif. It’s also good with dessert and is a great brunch wine.
And it has just 5 to 7 percent alcohol! Vietti makes a good one, called Cascinetta,
for about $14. Other good producers of Moscato d’Asti are Dante Rivetti,
Paolo Sarocco, and Ceretto, whose wine is called Santo Stefano; all these 
sell for $14 to $16. Again, freshness is essential. With Moscato d’Asti, let the
vintage date guide you; buy the youngest one you can find.
Dry spumante
Using the traditional method, Italy produces a good deal of dry sparkling
wine in the Oltrepò-Pavese and Franciacorta wine zones of Lombardy, and in
Trentino. Italy’s dry sparkling wines are very dry with little or no sweetening
dosage. They come in all price ranges:
282
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

 Affordable wines include Gancia Brut ($10) and Berlucchi Cuvée
Imperiale Brut ($15).
 Good mid-priced wines are Ferrari Brut and Banfi Brut (at about $23).
 Four upscale (and very good) bruts, all $35 to $40 and up, are Bellavista,
Cà del Bosco, Giulio Ferrari, and Bruno Giacosa Extra Brut. Giacosa,
well-known for his outstanding Barbarescos and Barolos, makes 100-
percent-Pinot Noir Brut in his spare time, for kicks. Like everything else
he produces, it’s superb.
Prosecco
This quintessential Italian sparkling wine has become all the rage in parts
of the United States, thanks to the fact that so many Italian restaurants
serve it by the glass. Prosecco comes from Prosecco grapes grown near
Venice and Treviso. It’s a straightforward, pleasant apéritif, low in alcohol
(about 11 to 12 percent), and it comes in dry, off-dry, and sweet styles.
Prosecco is mainly a frizzante wine, but it also comes as a spumante (fully
sparkling), or even as a non-sparkling wine (which we don’t recommend; it’s
better with bubbles). Most Prosecco bears the DOC appellation of either
Valdobbiadene or Conegliano (or, in some cases, both), which are two vil-
lages in the Veneto.
Prosecco is the perfect wine to have with Italian antipasto, such as pickled
vegetables, calamari, anchovies, or spicy salami. Its fresh, fruity flavors
cleanse your mouth and get your appetite going for dinner. And Prosecco is
eminently affordable: It retails for $12 to $18 a bottle. Recommended producers
(alphabetically) include Astoria, Bisson, Canevel, Carpenè Malvolti, Mionetto,
Nino Franco, Valdo, Zardetto, and Zonin.
Spanish sparkling wines (Cava)
What if you want to spend about $10 or less for a decent sparkling wine?
The answer is Spain’s sparkling wine, Cava, which sells mainly for $8 to 
$12 a bottle. Almost all of it comes from the Penedés region, near Barcelona.
Cava is made in the traditional method, fermented in the bottle. But most
Cavas use local Spanish grapes. As a result, they taste distinctly different
(a nicely earthy, mushroomy flavor) from California bubblies and from
Champagne. Some of the more expensive blends do contain Chardonnay.
283
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers

Two gigantic wineries dominate Cava production — Freixenet (pronounced
fresh net) and Codorniu. Freixenet’s frosted black Cordon Negro bottle has to
be one of the most recognizable wine bottles in the world. Other Cava brands
to look for are Mont Marçal, Paul Cheneau, Cristalino, Marqués de Monistrol,
and Segura Viudas. Juve y Camps, a vintage-dated, upscale Cava, is a worth-
while buy at $16.
Southern stars
Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa now make some very fine sparkling
wines in the traditional method. Australia boasts a really good $10 sparkler
called Seaview Brut; for something completely unusual, try Seaview’s deep
red sparkling Shiraz, about $12. Among New Zealand bubblies, one of the
finest is that of Highfield Estate in Marlborough. The South African sparkling
brut that has really impressed us comes from the Boschendal Estate in the
Franschhoek Valley and is called Le Grand Pavillion (about $13 to $15).
Traditional-method South African sparkling wines carry the words Cap
Classique on their labels.
Buying and Serving Bubbly
Sparkling wine is best cold, about 45°F (7° to 8°C), although some people
prefer it less cold (52°F; 11°C). We like the colder temperature because it
helps the wine hold its effervescence — and the wine warms up so quickly in
the glass, anyway. Because older Champagnes and Vintage Champagnes are
more complex, you can chill them less than young, non-vintage Champagne
or sparkling wine.
Never leave an open bottle of sparkling wine on the table unless it’s in an ice
bucket (half cold water, half ice) because it will warm up quickly. Use a
sparkling wine stopper to keep leftover bubbly fresh for a couple of days—in
the fridge, of course.
If you’re entertaining, you should know that the ideal bottle size for Champagne
is the magnum, which is equivalent to two bottles. The larger bottle enables the
wine to age more gently in the winery’s cellar. Magnums (or sometimes double
magnums) are usually the largest bottles in which Champagne is fermented;
all really large bottles have had finished Champagne poured into them, and
the wine is therefore not as fresh as it is in a magnum or a regular bottle.
284
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

Be wary of half-bottles (375 ml) and — chancier yet — splits (187 ml)!
Champagne in these small bottles is often not fresh. If you’re given a small
bottle of Champagne or any sparkling wine as a wedding favor, for example,
open it at the first excuse; do not keep it around for a year waiting for the
right occasion!
Champagne and other good, dry sparkling wines are extremely versatile with
food — and they are the essential wine for certain kinds of foods. For exam-
ple, no wine goes better with egg dishes than Champagne. Indulge yourself
next time that you have brunch. And when you’re having spicy Asian cuisine,
try sparkling wine. For us, no wine matches up better with spicy Chinese or
Indian food!
Fish, seafood, pasta (but not with tomato sauce), risotto, and poultry are
excellent with Champagne and sparkling wine. If you’re having lamb (pink,
not well-done) or ham, pair rosé Champagne with it. With aged Champagne,
chunks of aged Asiago, aged Gouda, or Parmesan cheese go extremely well.
Don’t serve a dry brut (or extra dry) sparkling wine with dessert. These
styles are just too dry. With fresh fruit and desserts that are not too sweet,
try a demi-sec Champagne. With sweeter desserts (or wedding cake!), we 
recommend Asti. (For more info on Champagne with food, see Chapter 14
in Champagne For Dummies.)
285
Chapter 14: Champagne and Other Sparklers
Baby Champagnes are “in”
Although Champagnes in small bottles — 375 ml
half-bottles and 187 ml splits — normally don’t
stay as fresh as Champagne in larger bottles,
size becomes less an issue when the bottles sell
quickly. A few savvy Champagne houses have
a novel way of selling their bubblies in the
United States: Attractively package the
Champagnes in small bottles, and make them
readily available in nightclubs and bars where
young people congregate. A few years ago,
Pommery introduced its “POP,” a bright blue
split (187 ml) that comes with a straw so that you
can even drink it right out of the bottle. It’s an
extra-dry non-vintage Champagne, not quite as
dry as a brut, which suits the casual occasions
when this wine is drunk. Not to be outdone,
Piper-Heidsieck followed with a bright red split
of its non-vintage brut, which it calls “Baby
Piper.” Both Champagnes have been selling
very well. Perrier-Jouët is now aggressively
marketing its half-bottles and splits; ditto Lanson
with its half-bottle. More houses will surely
follow.
Although Champagne is a serious wine, it obvi-
ously offers plenty of opportunity for fun!

Wine Roads Less Traveled:
Fortified and Dessert Wines
In This Chapter
 The world’s most versatile wine
 80 grapes for one wine
 A wine that lasts 200 years
 Liquid gold from rotted grapes
T
he wines we lump together as fortified wines and dessert wines aren’t
mainstream beverages that you want to drink every day. Some of them
are much higher in alcohol than regular wines, and some of them are
extremely sweet (and rare and expensive!). They’re the wine equivalent of
really good candy — delicious enough that you can get carried away if you
let yourself indulge daily. So you treat them as treats, a glass before or after
dinner, a bottle when company comes, a splurge to celebrate the start of your
diet — tomorrow.
Pleasure aside, from a purely academic point of view, you owe it to yourself
to try these wines. Seriously! Learning about wine is hard work, but it’s also
a lot of fun.
Timing Is Everything
Many wines enjoyed before dinner, as apéritif wines, or after dinner, as
dessert wines, fall into the category of fortified wines (called liqueur wines
by the European Union, or EU; see Chapter 4 for an explanation of EU terms).
Fortified wines all have alcohol added to them at some point in their produc-
tion, giving them an alcohol content that ranges from 16 to 24 percent.

The point at which alcohol is added determines whether the wines are natu-
rally sweet or dry.
 When fortified with alcohol during fermentation, the wines are sweet,
because the added alcohol stops fermentation, leaving natural, 
unfermented sugar in the wine. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation 
of fermentation.) Port is the classic example of this process.
 When fortified after fermentation (after all the grape sugar has been 
converted to alcohol), the wines are dry (unless they’re subsequently
sweetened). Sherry is the classic example of this process.
Some of the wines we call dessert wines don’t have added alcohol. Their sweet-
ness occurs because the grapes are at the right place at the right time —
when noble rot strikes. (See the discussion of German wines in Chapter 11.)
Other dessert wines are sweet because winemakers pick very ripe (but not
rotten) grapes and dry them before fermentation to concentrate their juice,
or they let the grapes freeze — just other ways of turning grape juice into the
nectar of the gods.
Sherry: A Misunderstood Wine
The late comedian Rodney Dangerfield built a career around the line, “I get
no respect!” His wine of choice should have been Sherry, because it shares
the same plight. Sherry is a wine of true quality and diversity, but it remains
undiscovered by most of the world. In a way, we’re not sorry, because the
price of good Sherry is attractively low.
The Jerez triangle
Sherry comes from the Andalucía region of sun-baked, southwestern Spain.
The wine is named after Jerez (her ETH) de la Frontera, an old town of
Moorish and Arab origin where many of the Sherry bodegas are located.
(Bodega can refer to the actual building in which Sherry is matured or to
the Sherry firm itself.)
Actually, the town of Jerez is just one corner of a triangle that makes up
the Sherry region. Another corner is Puerto de Santa María, a beautiful, old
coast town southwest of Jerez, and home to a number of large bodegas.
The third point of the triangle, Sanlúcar de Barrameda (also on the coast
but northwest of Jerez), is so blessed with sea breezes that the lightest and
driest of Sherries, manzanilla, can legally be made only there. Aficionados of
Sherry swear that they can detect the salty tang of the ocean in manzanilla
(mahn zah NEE yah).
288
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

Traveling from Sanlúcar to Jerez, you pass vineyards with dazzling white soil.
This soil is albariza, the region’s famous chalky earth, rich in limestone from fos-
silized shells. Summers are hot and dry, but balmy sea breezes temper the heat.
The Palomino grape — the main variety used in Sherry — thrives only here in
the hot Sherry region on albariza soil. Palomino is a complete failure for table
wines because it is so neutral in flavor and low in acid, but it’s perfect for
Sherry production. Two other grape varieties, Pedro Ximénez (PAY dro he
MAIN ehz) and Moscatel (Muscat), are used for dessert types of Sherry.
The phenomenon of flor
Sherry consists of two basic types: fino (light, very dry) and oloroso (rich and
full, but also dry). Sweet Sherries are made by sweetening either type.
After fermentation, the winemaker decides which Sherries will become finos
or olorosos (oh loh ROH sohs) by judging the appearance, aroma, and flavor
of the young, unfortified wines. If a wine is to be a fino (FEE no), the wine-
maker fortifies it lightly (until its alcohol level reaches about 15.5 percent).
He strengthens future olorosos to 18 percent alcohol.
At this point, when the wines are in casks, the special Sherry magic begins:
A yeast called flor grows spontaneously on the surface of the wines destined
to be finos. The flor eventually covers the whole surface, protecting the wine
from oxidation. The flor feeds on oxygen in the air and on alcohol and glycerin
in the wine. It changes the wine’s character, contributing a distinct aroma and
flavor and rendering the wine thinner and more delicate in texture.
Flor doesn’t grow on olorosos-to-be, because their higher alcohol content
prevents it. Without the protection of the flor (and because the casks are
never filled to the brim), these wines are exposed to oxygen as they age.
This deliberate oxidation protects olorosos against further oxidation — for
example, after you open a bottle.
Communal aging
Both fino and oloroso Sherries age in a special way that’s unique to Sherry
making.
The young wine isn’t left to age on its own (as most other wines would) but is
added to casks of older wine that are already aging. To make room for the
young wine, some of the older wine is emptied out of the casks and is added
to casks of even older wine. To make room in those casks, some of the wine is
transferred to casks of even older wine, and so on. At the end of this chain,
four to nine generations away from the young wine, some of the finished
Sherry is taken from the oldest casks and is bottled for sale.
289
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

This system of blending wines is called the solera system. It takes its name
from the word solera (floor), the term also used to identify the casks of
oldest wine.
As wines are blended — younger into older, into yet older, and eventually
into oldest — no more than a third of the wine is emptied from any cask.
In theory, then, each solera contains small (and ever-decreasing) amounts
of very old wine. As each younger wine mingles with older wine, it takes on
characteristics of the older wine; within a few months, the wine of each gen-
eration is indistinguishable from what it was before being refreshed with
younger wine. Thus, the solera system maintains infinite consistency of 
quality and style in Sherry.
Because the casks of Sherry age in dry, airy bodegas above ground (rather
than humid, underground cellars like most other wines), some of the wine’s
water evaporates, and the wine’s alcoholic strength increases. Some olorosos
aged for more than ten years can be as much as 24 percent alcohol, compared
to their starting point of 18 percent.
Two makes twelve
So far, so good: two types of Sherry — delicate fino aged under its protective
flor, and fuller oloroso, aged oxidatively — and no vintages, because the
young wines are blended with older wines. But now Sherry begins to get 
a bit confusing. Those two types are about to branch into at least twelve.
New styles occur when the natural course of aging changes the character of
a Sherry so that its taste no longer conforms to one of the two categories.
Deliberate sweetening of the wine also creates different styles.
Among dry Sherries, these are the main styles:
 Fino: Pale, straw-colored Sherry, light in body, dry, and delicate. Fino
Sherries are always matured under flor, either in Jerez or Puerto de
Santa María. They have 15 to 17 percent alcohol. After they lose their
protective flor (by bottling), finos become very vulnerable to oxidation
spoilage, and you must therefore store them in a cool place, drink them
young, and refrigerate them after opening. They’re best when chilled.
 Manzanilla: Pale, straw-colored, delicate, light, tangy, and very dry fino-
style Sherry made only in Sanlucar de Barrameda. (Although various
styles of manzanilla are produced, manzanilla fina, the fino style, is by
far the most common.) The temperate sea climate causes the flor to
grow thicker in this town, and manzanilla is thus the driest and most
pungent of all the Sherries. Handle it similarly to a fino Sherry.
 Manzanilla pasada: A manzanilla that has been aged in cask about seven
years and has lost its flor. It’s more amber in color than a manzanilla fina
and fuller-bodied. It’s close to a dry amontillado (see the next item) in
style, but still crisp and pungent. Serve cool.
290
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

 Amontillado: An aged fino that has lost its flor in the process of cask
aging. It’s deeper amber in color and richer and nuttier than the previ-
ous styles. Amontillado (ah moan tee YAH doh) is dry but retains some
of the pungent tang from its lost flor. True amontillado is fairly rare;
most of the best examples are in the $25 to $40 price range. Cheaper
Sherries labeled “amontillado” are common, so be suspicious if it costs
less than $15 a bottle. Serve amontillado slightly cool and, for best
flavor, finish the bottle within a week.
 Oloroso: Dark gold to deep brown in color (depending on its age), full-
bodied with rich, raisiny aroma and flavor, but dry. Olorosos lack the
delicacy and pungency of fino (flor) Sherries. They’re usually between
18 and 20 percent alcohol and can keep for a few weeks after you open
the bottle because they have already been oxidized in their aging. Serve
them at room temperature.
 Palo cortado: The rarest of all Sherries. It starts out as a fino, with 
a flor, and develops as an amontillado, losing its flor. But then, for some
unknown reason, it begins to resemble the richer, more fragrant oloroso
style, all the while retaining the elegance of an amontillado. In color and
alcohol content, palo cortado (PAH loe cor TAH doh) is similar to an
oloroso, but its aroma is quite like an amontillado. Like amontillado
Sherry, beware of cheap imitations. Serve at room temperature. It keeps
as well as olorosos.
Sweet Sherry is dry Sherry that has been sweetened. The sweetening can
come in many forms, such as the juice of Pedro Ximénez grapes that have
been dried like raisins. All the following sweet styles of Sherry are best
served at room temperature:
 Medium Sherry: Amontillados and light olorosos that have been slightly
sweetened. They are light brown in color.
 Pale cream: Made by blending fino and light amontillado Sherries and
lightly sweetening the blend. They have a very pale gold color. Pale cream
is a fairly new style.
 Cream Sherry: Cream and the lighter “milk” Sherries are rich amorosos
(the term for sweetened olorosos). They vary in quality, depending on
the oloroso used, and can improve in the bottle with age. These Sherries
are a popular style.
 Brown Sherry: Very dark, rich, sweet, dessert Sherry, usually containing
a coarser style of oloroso.
 East India Sherry: A type of Brown Sherry that has been deeply sweet-
ened and colored.
 Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel: Extremely sweet, dark brown, syrupy
dessert Sherries. Often lower in alcohol, these Sherries are made from
raisined grapes of these two varieties. As varietally labeled Sherries,
they are quite rare today. Delicious over vanilla ice cream (really!).
291
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

Some wines from elsewhere in the world, especially the United States, also
call themselves “Sherry.” Many of these are inexpensive wines in large bot-
tles. Occasionally you can find a decent one, but usually they’re sweet and
not very good. Authentic Sherry is made only in the Jerez region of Spain and
carries the official name, Jerez-Xérès-Sherry (the Spanish, French, and English
names for the town) on the front or back label.
Serving and storing Sherry
The light, dry Sherries — fino and manzanilla — must be fresh. Buy them
from stores with rapid turnover; a fino or manzanilla that has been languish-
ing on the shelf for several months will not give you the authentic experience
of these wines.
Although fino or manzanilla can be an excellent apéritif, be careful when
ordering a glass in a restaurant or bar. Never accept a glass from an already-
open bottle unless the bottle has been refrigerated. Even then, ask how long
it has been open — more than two days is too much. After you open a bottle
at home, refrigerate it and finish it within a couple of days.
We like to buy half-bottles of fino and manzanilla so that we don’t have 
leftover wine that oxidizes. These, and all Sherries, can be stored upright.
Try not to hold bottles of fino or manzanilla more than three months, how-
ever. The higher alcohol and the oxidative aging of other types of Sherry
(amontillado, oloroso, palo cortado, all the sweet Sherries) permit you to
hold them for several years.
Manzanilla and fino Sherry are ideal with almonds, olives, shrimp or prawns,
all kinds of seafood, and those wonderful tapas in Spanish bars and restau-
rants. Amontillado Sherries can accompany tapas before dinner but are also
fine at the table with light soups, cheese, ham, or salami (especially the
Spanish type, chorizo). Dry olorosos and palo cortados are best with nuts,
olives, and hard cheeses (such as the excellent Spanish sheep-milk cheese,
Manchego). All the sweet Sherries can be served with desserts after dinner
or enjoyed on their own.
292
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 
Nut’n Sherry
The aroma of fino Sherry is often compared with
almonds. Amontillados are said to smell like
hazelnuts, and olorosos smell like walnuts. And,
by the way, the named nuts make ideal accom-
paniments to each particular sherry.

Recommended Sherries
Sherries are among the great values in the wine world: You can buy decent,
genuine Sherries for $7 or $8. But if you want to try the best wines, you may
have to spend $15 or more. The following are some of our favorite Sherries,

 González Byass’s Pedro Ximénez “Noe” ($48; half-bottle, $27)
Montilla: A Sherry look-alike
Northeast of the Sherry region is the Montilla-Moriles region (commonly
referred to as Montilla), where wines very similar to Sherry are made in fino,
amontillado, and oloroso styles. The two big differences between Montilla
(moan TEE yah) and Sherry are
 Pedro Ximénez is the predominant grape variety in Montilla.
 Montillas usually reach their high alcohol levels naturally (without 
fortification).
Alvear is the leading brand of Montilla. Reasonably priced (about $14), these
wines are widely available, as Finos or Amontillados.
Marsala, Vin Santo, and the Gang
Italy has a number of interesting dessert and fortified wines, of which Marsala
(named after a town in western Sicily) is the most famous. Marsala is a forti-
fied wine made from local grape varieties. It comes in numerous styles, all of
which are fortified after fermentation, like Sherry, and aged in a form of the
solera system. You can find dry, semi-dry, or sweet versions and amber, gold,
or red versions, but the best Marsalas have the word Superiore or — even
better — Vergine or Vergine Soleras on the label. Marsala Vergine is unsweet-
ened and uncolored, and is aged longer than other styles.
Marco De Bartoli is the most acclaimed producer of dry-style Marsala. 
His 20-year-old Vecchio Samperi (about $50 for a 500 ml bottle) is an excellent
example of a dry, apéritif Marsala. Pellegrino, Rallo, and Florio are larger pro-
ducers of note. (For more info on Marsala and all other Sicilian fortified or
dessert wines, see Chapter 11 in Italian Wine For Dummies.)

Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

Two fascinating dessert wines are made on small islands near Sicily from
dried grapes. One is Malvasia delle Lipari, from the estate of the late Carlo
Hauner. This wine has a beautiful, orange-amber color and an incredible
floral, apricot, and herb aroma ($25 to $27 for a half-bottle). The other is
Moscato di Pantelleria, a very delicious sweet wine. De Bartoli is one of the
best producers; look for his Bukkuram Passito Pantelleria (about $70 for a
500 ml bottle).
The region of Tuscany is rightfully proud of its Vin Santo (vin SAHN toh), a
golden amber wine made from dried grapes and barrel-aged for several years.
Vin Santo can be dry, medium-dry, or sweet. We prefer the first two — the dry
style as an apéritif, and the medium-dry version as an accompaniment to the
wonderful Italian almond cookies called biscotti.
Many Tuscan producers make a Vin Santo; four outstanding examples of Vin
Santo (conveniently available in half-bottles as well as full bottles) are from
Avignonesi (very expensive!), Badia a Coltibuono, Castello di Cacchiano, and
San Giusto a Rentennano.
Port: The Glory of Portugal
Port is the world’s greatest fortified red wine.
The British invented Port, thanks to one of their many wars with the French,
when they were forced to buy Portuguese wine as an alternative to French
wine. To insure that the Portuguese wines were stable enough for shipment
by sea, the British had a small amount of brandy added to finished wine, and
early Port was the result. The English established their first Port house,
Warre, in the city of Oporto in 1670, and several others followed.
Ironically, the French, who drove the British to Portugal, today drink three
times as much Port as the British! But, of course, the French have the highest
per capita consumption of wine in the world.
Home, home on the Douro
Port takes its name from the city of Oporto, situated where the northerly
Douro River empties into the Atlantic Ocean. But its vineyards are far away,
in the hot, mountainous Douro Valley. (In 1756, this wine region became
one of the first in the world to be officially recognized by its government.)
Some of the most dramatically beautiful vineyards anywhere are on the
slopes of the upper Douro — still very much a rugged, unspoiled area.
295
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

Port wine is fermented and fortified in the Douro Valley, and then most of it
travels downriver to the coast. The large shippers’ wine is finished and
matured in the Port lodges of Vila Nova de Gaia, a suburb of Oporto, while
most small producers mature their wine in the Valley. From Oporto, the wine
is shipped all over the world.
To stop your wine-nerd friends in their tracks, ask them to name the authorized
grape varieties for Port. (There are more than 80!) In truth, most wine lovers —
even Port lovers — can’t name more than one variety. These grapes are mostly
local and unknown outside of Portugal. For the record, the five most impor-
tant varieties are Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), Tinta Barroca,
Tinto Cão, and Touriga Franca.
Many Ports in a storm
Think Sherry is complicated? In some ways, Port is even trickier. Although
all Port is sweet, and most of it is red, a zillion styles exist. The styles vary
according to the quality of the base wine (ranging from ordinary to excep-
tional), how long the wine is aged in wood before bottling (ranging from 
2 to 40-plus years), and whether the wine is from a single year or blended
from wines of several years.
Following is a brief description of the main styles, from simplest to most 
complex:
 White Port: Made from white grapes, this gold-colored wine can be off-
dry or sweet. We couldn’t quite figure out why it existed — Sherries and
Sercial Madeiras (discussed later in this chapter) are better as apéritifs
and red Ports are far superior as sweet wines — until someone served
us white Port with tonic and ice one day. Served this way, white Port can
be a bracing warm-weather apéritif.
296
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 
Port-O
The term Port has been borrowed even more
extensively around the world than “Sherry” has.
Many countries outside the EU make sweet, red
wine in the Port style and label it as Port. Some
of it can be quite good, but it’s never as fine as
the genuine article that is made only in Portugal.
The trick in identifying authentic Portuguese
Port is to look for the word Porto, which always
appears on the label.

 Ruby Port: This young, non-vintage style is aged in wood for about three
years before release. Fruity, simple, and inexpensive (around $12 for
major brands), it’s the best-selling type of Port. If labeled Reserve or
Special Reserve, the wine has usually aged about six years and costs a
few dollars more. Ruby Port is a good introduction to the Port world.
 Vintage Character Port: Despite its name, this wine is not single-vintage
Port — it just tries to taste like one. Vintage Character Port is actually
premium ruby blended from higher-quality wines of several vintages and
matured in wood for about five years. Full-bodied, rich, and ready-to-
drink when released, these wines are a good value at about $17 to $19.
But the labels don’t always say Vintage Character; instead, they often
bear proprietary names such as Founder’s Reserve (from Sandeman);
Bin 27 (Fonseca); Six Grapes (Graham); First Estate (Taylor Fladgate);
Warrior (Warre); and Distinction (Croft). As if Vintage Character wouldn’t
have been confusing enough!
 Tawny Port: Tawny is the most versatile Port style. The best tawnies are
good-quality wines that fade to a pale garnet or brownish red color during
long wood aging. Their labels carry an indication of their average age
(the average age of the wines from which they were blended) — 10, 20,
30, or over-40 years. Ten-year-old tawnies cost about $30, 20-year-olds
sell for $45 to $50, and 30- and over-40-year-old tawnies cost a lot more
($90 to well over $100). We consider 10- and 20-year-old tawnies the best
buys; the older ones aren’t always worth the extra bucks. Tawny Ports
have more finesse than other styles and are appropriate both as apéri-
tifs and after dinner. Inexpensive tawnies that sell for about the same
price as ruby Port are usually weak in flavor and not worth buying.
A serious tawny Port can be enjoyed in warm weather (even with a few
ice cubes!) when a Vintage Port would be too heavy and tannic.
 Colheita Port: Often confused with Vintage Port because it’s vintage-
dated, colheita is actually a tawny from a single vintage. In other words,
it has aged (and softened and tawnied) in wood for many years. Unlike
an aged tawny, though, it’s the wine of a single year. Niepoort is one of
the few Port houses that specializes in colheita Port. It can be very good
but older vintages are quite expensive (about $100). Smith Woodhouse
and Delaforce offer colheita Portos for $50 or less.
 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LBV): This type is from a specific vintage, but
usually not from a very top year. The wine ages four to six years in wood
before bottling and is then ready to drink, unlike Vintage Port. Quite full-
bodied, but not as hefty as Vintage Port, it sells for about $18 to $23.
 Vintage Port: The pinnacle of Port production, Vintage Port is the wine of
a single year blended from several of a house’s best vineyards. It’s bottled
at about two years of age, before the wine has much chance to shed its
tough tannins. It therefore requires an enormous amount of bottle aging
to accomplish the development that didn’t occur in wood. Vintage Port is
usually not mature (ready to drink) until about 20 years after the vintage.
297
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

Because it’s very rich and very tannic, this wine throws a heavy sediment
and must be decanted, preferably several hours before drinking (it needs
the aeration). Vintage Port can live 70 or more years in top vintages.
Most good Vintage Ports sell for $75 to $100 when they’re first released
(years away from drinkability). Mature Vintage Ports can cost well over
$100. Producing a Vintage Port amounts to a declaration of that vintage
(a term you hear in Port circles) on the part of an individual Port house.
 Single Quinta Vintage Port: These are Vintage Ports from a single estate
(quinta) that is usually a producer’s best property (such as Taylor’s
Vargellas and Graham’s Malvedos). They’re made in good years, but
not in the best vintages, because then their grapes are needed for the
Vintage Port blend. They have the advantage of being readier to drink
than declared Vintage Ports — at less than half their price — and of usu-
ally being released when they’re mature. You should decant and aerate
them before serving, however. (Some Port houses, incidentally, are them-
selves single estates, such as Quinta do Noval, Quinta do Infantado, and
Quinta do Vesuvio. When such a house makes a vintage-dated Port, it’s a
Vintage Port, as well as a single quinta Port. But that’s splitting hairs.)
Storing and serving Port
Treat Vintage Ports like all other fine red wines: Store the bottles on their
sides in a cool place. You can store other Ports either on their sides (if they
have a cork rather than a plastic-topped cork stopper) or upright. All Ports,
except white, ruby, and older Vintage Ports, keep well for a week or so after
opening, with aged-stated tawny capable of keeping for a few weeks.
You can now find Vintage Ports and some Vintage Character Ports, such as
Fonseca Bin 27, in half-bottles — a brilliant development for Port lovers.
Enjoying a bottle after dinner is far easier to justify when it’s just a half-bottle.
The wine evolves slightly more quickly in half-bottles, and considering the
wine’s longevity, that may even be a bonus!
298
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 
It’s worth a try!
Don’t let all the complicated styles of Port deter
you from picking up a bottle and trying it. If you’ve
never had Port before, you’re bound to love it —
almost no matter which style you try. (Later, you
can fine-tune your preference for one style or
another.) Port is, simply, delicious!

Serve Port at cool room temperature, 64°F (18°C), although tawny Port can
be an invigorating pick-me-up when served chilled during warm weather.
The classic complements to Port are walnuts and strong cheeses, such as
Stilton, Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Cheddar, and aged Gouda.
Recommended Port producers
In terms of quality, with the exception of a few clunker producers, Port is one
of the most consistent of all wines. We’ve organized our favorite Port produc-
ers into two categories — outstanding and very good — in rough order of
preference. As you might expect, wines in the first group tend to be a bit more
expensive. Our rating is based mainly on Vintage Port but can be generally
applied to all the various Port styles of the house.

Another Portuguese classic
One of the great dessert wines made mainly
from the white or pink Muscat grape is Setúbal
(SHTOO bahl). Produced just south of Lisbon,
Setúbal is made similarly to Port, with alcohol
added to stop fermentation. Like Port, it’s a rich,
long-lasting wine. The most important producer
is J. M. da Fonseca.

Recent good vintages of Vintage Port to buy include 2000, 1994, 1992, and
1991, with both 2003 (just released) and 2004 (will be released beginning
in 2007) showing promise for the future. (For a complete list of Vintage Port
vintages, see Appendix C.)
Long Live Madeira
The legendary wine called Madeira comes from the island of the same name,
which sits in the Atlantic Ocean nearer to Africa than Europe. Madeira is a
subtropical island whose precarious hillside vineyards rise straight up from
the ocean. The island is a province of Portugal, but the British have always
run its wine trade. Historically, Madeira could even be considered something
of an American wine, for this is the wine that American colonists drank.
Madeira can lay claim to being the world’s longest-lived wine. A few years ago,
we were fortunate enough to try a 1799 Vintage Madeira that was still per-
fectly fine. Only Hungary’s Tokaji Azsu (see Chapter 11, “The Re-emergence
of Hungary”) can rival Vintage Madeira in longevity, and that’s true only of
Tokaji Azsu’s rarest examples, such as its Essencia.
Although Madeira’s fortified wines were quite the rage 200 years ago, the
island’s vineyards were devastated at the end of the nineteenth century, first
by mildew and then by the phylloxera louse. Most vineyards were replanted
with lesser grapes. Madeira has spent a long time recovering from these set-
backs. In the 19th century, more than 70 companies were shipping Madeira
all over the world; now, only six companies of any size exist: Barbeito, H. M
Borges, Henriques & Henriques, Justino Henriques, the Madeira Wine Company
(the largest by far, a consolidation of four old companies — Blandy’s, Cossart
Gordon, Leacock’s, and Miles), and Pereira d’Oliveira.
The very best Madeira wines are still those from the old days, vintage-dated
wines from 1920 back to 1795. Surprisingly, you can still find a few Madeiras
from the nineteenth century. The prices aren’t outrageous, either ($300 to
$400 a bottle), considering what other wines that old, such as Bordeaux, cost.
(Refer to Chapter 16 for sources of old Madeira.)
Timeless, indestructible, and tasty
The best Madeira comes in four styles, two fairly dry and two sweet. The
sweeter Madeiras generally have their fermentation halted somewhat early by
the addition of alcohol. Drier Madeiras have alcohol added after fermentation.
300
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

A curiosity of most Madeira production is a baking process called the estufagem
(es too FAH jem), which follows fermentation. The fact that Madeira improves
with heat was discovered back in the seventeenth century. When trading
ships crossed the equator with casks of Madeira as ballast in their holds, the
wine actually improved! Today’s practice of baking the wine at home on the
island is a bit more practical than sending it around the world in a slow boat.
In the estufagem process, Madeira spends a minimum of three months, often
longer, in heated tanks, in estufas (heating rooms). Any sugars in the wine
become caramelized, and the wine becomes thoroughly maderized (oxidized
through heating) without developing any unpleasant aroma or taste.
A more laborious and considerably more expensive way of heating Madeira
is the canteiro method, in which barrels are left in warm lofts of or exposed
to the sun (the weather stays warm year-round) for as long as three years.
The same magical metamorphosis takes place in the wines. The canteiro
method is best for Madeira because the wines retain their high acidity, color,
and extract much better in the slow, natural three-year process; only the finer
Madeiras use this method of aging.
Endless finish
Technically, almost all the best Madeira starts as white wine, but the heating
process and years of maturation give it an amber color. It has a tangy aroma
and flavor that’s uniquely its own, and as long a finish on the palate as you’ll
find on the planet. When Madeira is made from any of the island’s five noble
grapes (listed later in this section), the grape name indicates the style.
When Madeira doesn’t carry a grape name — and most younger Madeiras
don’t — the words dry, medium-dry, medium-sweet, and sweet indicate the style.
Vintage Madeira must spend at least 20 years in a cask, but in the old days,
the aging was even longer. Some of the most memorable wines we’ve ever
tasted were old Madeiras, and so we’re afraid we might get carried away a
bit, beginning any time now. Their aroma alone is divine, and you continue
tasting the wine long after you’ve swallowed it. (Spitting is out of the question.)
Words truly are inadequate to describe this wine.
If you can afford to buy an old bottle of vintage-dated Madeira (the producer’s
name is relatively unimportant), you’ll understand our enthusiasm. And maybe
some day when Madeira production gets back on its feet, every wine lover will
be able to experience Vintage Madeira. In the meantime, for a less expensive
Madeira experience, look for wines labeled 15 years old, 10 years old, or 5 years
old. Don’t bother with any other type, because it will be unremarkable, and
then we’ll look crazy.
301
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

You never have to worry about Madeira getting too old. It’s indestructible.
The enemies of wine — heat and oxygen — have already had their way with
Madeira during the winemaking and maturing process. Nothing you do after
it’s opened can make it blink.
If a Madeira is dated with the word Solera — for example, “Solera 1890” — it
is not a Vintage Madeira but a blend of many younger vintages whose original
barrel, or solera, dates back to 1890. Solera-dated Madeiras can be very fine
and are generally not as expensive — nor as great — as Vintage Madeiras.
But Solera Madeiras are becoming obsolete today. In their place is a new
style of Madeira, called Colheita or Harvest. This style is modeled after
Colheita Porto (see “Colheita Port” in the “Many Ports in a Storm” section in
this chapter) in that colheita Madeira is a single vintage-dated Madeira wine.
Colheita Madeira doesn’t have to spend a minimum of 20 years aging in cask,
as does Vintage Madeira, but only five — or seven for the driest, Sercial. (For
example, the 1994 colheita Madeira debuted in 2000 at only six years of age.)
Colheita Madeira is much less expensive than vintage Madeira. Most of the
six major Madeira shippers are now selling colheita; sales of vintage-dated
Madeira have doubled since the introduction of this style.
Vintage, colheita, and solera-dated Madeiras are made from a single grape
variety and are varietally labeled. The grapes include five noble white grape
varieties and one less noble red variety. (Another noble red variety, Bastardo,
is no longer used for commercial production.) Each variety corresponds to a
specific style of wine; we list them from driest style to sweetest.
 Sercial: The Sercial grape grows at the highest altitudes. Thus, the
grapes are the least ripe and make the driest Madeira. The wine is high
in acidity and very tangy. Sercial Madeira is an outstanding apéritif wine
with almonds, olives, or light cheeses. Unfortunately, true Sercial is quite
rare today.
 Verdelho: The Verdelho grape makes a medium-dry style, with nutty,
peachy flavors and a tang of acidity. It’s good as an apéritif or with 
consommé.
 Bual (or Boal): Darker amber in color, Bual is a rich, medium-sweet
Madeira with spicy flavors of almonds and raisins and a long, tangy
finish. Bual is best after dinner. Like Sercial, true Bual is rare today.
 Malmsey: Made from the Malvasia grape, Malmsey is dark amber, sweet,
and intensely concentrated with a very long finish. Drink it after dinner.
Two rare varieties, whose names you may see on some very old bottles, are
 Terrantez: Medium-sweet, between Verdelho and Bual in style, this is a
powerful, fragrant Madeira with lots of acidity. For some Madeira lovers,
Terrantez is the greatest variety of all. Unfortunately, very little Terrantez
is available today; Henriques & Henriques still produces it. Drink it after
dinner.
302
Part V: Wine’s Exotic Face 

 Bastardo: This is the only red grape of the noble varieties. Old Bastardos
from the last century are mahogany-colored and rich, but not as rich as
the Terrantez.
The less-noble red Tinta Negra Mole variety is the dominant grape for today’s
Madeira production (used for over 85 percent of Madeira wines), because it
grows more prolifically than the five noble varieties (Sercial, Verdelho, Bual,
Malmsey, and Terrantez) without the diseases to which they are prone.
Also, it is less site-specific; it can grow anywhere on the island, unlike the
noble varieties, which grow in vineyards close to the sea where the urban
sprawl of Funchal, Madeira’s capital city, impinges on them. Previously, the
less-regarded Tinta Negra Mole wasn’t identified as a variety on bottles of
Madeira but now, the huge Madeira Wine Company is beginning to varietally-
label Tinta Negra Mole Madeiras.
Sauternes and the Nobly Rotten Wines
Warm, misty autumns encourage the growth of a fungus called botrytis
cinerea in vineyards. Nicknamed noble rot, botrytis concentrates the liquid
and sugar in the grapes, giving the winemaker amazingly rich juice to fer-
ment. The best wines from botrytis-infected grapes are among the greatest
dessert wines in the world, with intensely concentrated flavors and plenty
of acidity to prevent the wine from tasting excessively sweet.
The greatest nobly rotten wines are made in the Sauternes district of Graves
(Bordeaux) and in Germany (see Chapter 11), but they are also produced in
Austria and California, among other places.
Sauternes: Liquid gold
Sauternes is a very labor-intensive wine. Grapes must be picked by hand;
workers pass through the vineyard several times — sometimes over a period
of weeks — each time selecting only the botrytis-infected grapes. Yields are
low. Harvests sometimes linger until November, but now and then bad weather
in October dashes all hopes of making botrytis-infected wine. Often, only two
to four vintages per decade make decent Sauternes (but the 1980s decade
was exceptional, and so far, the 2000s decade has been phenomenal; see the
vintage chart in Appendix C).
Consequently, good Sauternes is expensive. Prices range from $45 to $50 a
bottle up to $300 (depending on the vintage) for Château d’Yquem (d’ee kem).
The greatest Sauternes, d’Yquem has always been prized by collectors (see
Chapter 16). It was the only Sauternes given the status of first great growth in
the 1855 Bordeaux Classification (see Chapter 9).
303
Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

Sauternes is widely available in half-bottles, reducing the cost somewhat.
A 375 ml bottle is a perfect size for after dinner, and you can buy a decent
half-bottle of Sauternes or Barsac, a dessert wine similar to Sauternes, like
Château Doisy-Védrines (dwahs ee veh dreen) or Château Doisy-Daëne
(dwahs ee dah en) for $25 to $30.
Mining the gold
The Sauternes wine district includes five communes in the southernmost
part of Graves (one of them named Sauternes). One of the five, Barsac, is enti-
tled to its own appellation; Barsac wines are slightly lighter and less sweet
than Sauternes. The Garonne River and the Ciron, an important tributary,
produce the mists that encourage botrytis cinerea to form on the grapes.
The three authorized grape varieties are Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and
Muscadelle — although the latter is used by only a few chateaux, and even
then in small quantities. Sémillon is the king of Sauternes. Most producers
use at least 80 percent of Sémillon in their blend.
Wine that is called “Sauterne” (no final “s”) is produced in California and
other places. This semisweet, rather insipid wine is made from inexpensive
grapes and usually sold in large bottles. It bears absolutely no resemblance
to true, botrytis-infected Sauternes, from Sauternes, France. California does
make late-harvest, botrytis-infected wines, mainly Rieslings, and while they
are far better than California Sauterne (and even worth trying), they are very
different wines from the botrytis wines of Sauternes or of Germany.
Recommended Sauternes
All the Sauternes in the following list range from outstanding to good.
(Wines specifically from Barsac are labeled as such.) In Sauternes, vintages
are just as important as in the rest of Bordeaux; check our vintage recommen-
dations in Appendix C.

Chapter 15: Fortified and Dessert Wines

Letting baby grow
Sauternes has such balance of natural sweetness and acidity that it can age
well (especially the better Sauternes mentioned here) for an extraordinarily
long time. Unfortunately, because Sauternes is so delicious, people often
drink it young, when it’s very rich and sweet. But Sauternes is really at its
best when it loses its baby fat and matures.
After about ten to fifteen years, Sauternes’s color changes from light gold to
an old gold-coin color, sometimes with orange or amber tones. At this point,
the wine loses some of its sweetness and develops flavors reminiscent of
apricots, orange rind, honey, and toffee. This stage is the best time to drink
Sauternes. The better the vintage, the longer Sauternes takes to reach this
stage, but once there, it stays at this plateau for many years — sometimes
decades — and very gradually turns dark amber or light brown in color.
Even in these final stages, Sauternes retains some of its complex flavors.
In good vintages, Sauternes can age for 50 to 60 years or more. Château
d’Yquem and Château Climens are particularly long-lived. (We recently 
had a half-bottle of 1893 Château d’Yquem that was glorious!)
Sauternes is best when served cold, but not ice cold, at about 52° to 53°F
(11°C). Mature Sauternes can be served a bit warmer. Because the wine is so
rich, Sauternes is an ideal companion for foie gras although, ordinarily, the
wine is far more satisfying after dinner than as an apéritif. As for desserts,
Sauternes is excellent with ripe fruits, lemon-flavored cakes, or pound cake.
Sauternes look-alikes
Many sweet, botrytis-infected wines similar to Sauternes exist; they sell for
considerably less money than Sauternes or Barsacs. These wines are not as
intense or as complex in flavor, but they are fine values at $15 to $25.
Directly north and adjacent to Barsac is the often overlooked Cérons wine
region. You can probably convince many of your friends that a Cérons,
served blind, is a Sauternes or Barsac. From the Entre-Deux-Mers district of
Bordeaux, look for wines with the Cadillac, Loupiac, or Sainte-Croix-du-Mont
appellations — all less expensive versions of Sauternes and Monbazillac from
farther afield.

When You’ve
Caught the Bug

In this part . . .
T
he incubation period of the wine bug is unpredictable.
Some people no sooner express interest in wine than
they become engrossed in the subject. Other people exhibit
mild symptoms for many years before succumbing to the
passion. (And believe it or not, a lot of people are immune.)
But as soon as you’ve been bitten by the wine bug, you
know it. You find yourself subscribing to magazines that
your friends never heard of, making new friends with whom
you have little in common other than an interest in wine,
boycotting restaurants with substandard wine lists, and
planning vacations to wine regions!

 Helping your wine stay healthy
You read about a wine that sounds terrific. Your curiosity is piqued; you
want to try it. But your local wine shop doesn’t have the wine. Neither
does the best store in the next town. Or maybe you decide to balance your
wine collection by buying some mature wines. But the few older wines you
can find in wine shops aren’t really what you want.
How do other wine lovers manage to get their hands on special bottles of
wine when you can’t?
Wines That Play Hard to Get
There’s a catch-22 for wine lovers who have really caught the bug: The more
desirable a wine is, the harder it is to get. And the harder it is to get, the more
desirable it is.
Several forces conspire to frustrate buyers who want to get their hands on
special bottles. First, some of the best wines are made in ridiculously small
quantities. We wouldn’t say that quantity and quality are necessarily incom-
patible in winemaking, but at the very highest echelons of quality, there usually
isn’t much quantity to go around.
We once bought six bottles of a grand cru red Burgundy produced by a small
grower, Hubert Lignier. We learned that Lignier made only 150 cases of that
wine, and 50 of those cases came to the United States. We found it incredible
that we could buy half a case of such a rare wine for ourselves, leaving only
49.5 cases to satisfy the whole rest of the country! Right time, right place.

Today, many small-production wines sell on allocation, which means that dis-
tributors restrict the quantity that any one store can purchase, sometimes
limiting stores to as few as six bottles of a particular wine. Most stores, in
turn, limit customers to just one or two bottles. Certain wines are allocated
in such a way that they’re available primarily at restaurants.
The issue of allocations brings us to the second factor preventing equal
opportunity in wine buying: Wine buying is a competitive sport. If you’re
there first, you get the wine, and the next guy doesn’t. (We’ve been on the
short end of that deal plenty of times, too.)
Buying highly rated wines is especially competitive. When a wine receives a
very high score from critics, a feeding frenzy results among wine lovers, not
leaving much for Johnnies-come-lately. (See Chapter 17 for information on
wine critics and Chapters 18 and 21 for more on wine ratings.)
A final factor limiting availability of some wines is that wineries usually sell
each wine just once, when the wine is young. In the case of many fine wines,
such as top Bordeaux wines, the wine isn’t at its best yet. But most wine mer-
chants can’t afford to store the wine for selling years later. This means that
aged wines are usually hard to get.
Playing Hardball
When the wine plays hard-to-get, you have to play hardball; you have to look
beyond your normal sources of supply. Your allies in this game are wine auction
houses, wine shops in other cities, and, in the case of domestic wines, the
wineries themselves.
Buying wines at auctions
The clear advantage of buying wine through auction houses is the availability
of older and rarer wines. In fact, auction houses are the principal source of
mature wines — their specialty. (In general, you can obtain younger wines at
better prices elsewhere.) At auctions, you can buy wines that are practically
impossible to obtain any other way. Many of these wines have been off the
market for years — sometimes decades!
The main disadvantage of buying wine at auction is that you don’t always know
the storage history — or provenance — of the wine you’re considering buying.
The wine may have been stored in somebody’s warm apartment for years. And
if the wine does come from a reputable wine collector’s temperature-controlled
cellar, and thus has impeccable credentials, it will sell for a very high price.
310
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

Also, almost all auction houses charge you a buyer’s premium, a tacked-on
charge that’s 10 or 15 percent of your bid. In general, prices of wine at auc-
tions range from fair (rarely, you even find bargains) to exorbitant.
If you’re personally present at an auction, be careful not to catch auction
fever. The desire to win can motivate you to pay more for a wine than it’s
worth. Carefully thought-out, judicious bidding is in order. To plan your
attack, you can obtain a catalog for the auction ahead of time, usually for a
small fee. The catalog lists wines for sale by lots (usually groupings of three,
six, or twelve bottles) with a suggested minimum bid per lot.

Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine
Improving your odds of getting a good, old bottle
Acquiring and drinking old wines requires you
to be a bit of a gambler. But you can reduce the
odds against buying a bottle well past its peak
by following a few easy tips:
 Buy from reputable wine merchants and
auction houses. They often know the history
of their older wines, and most likely acquired
the wines from sources that they trust.
 Trade bottles only with wine-savvy friends
who know the storage history of their wines.
 Stick to well-known wines with a proven
track record of longevity.
 Inspect the wine if you can. Look at the
ullage (the airspace between the wine and
the cork). Ullage of an inch or more can be
a danger sign indicating that evaporation
has occurred, either from excessive heat or
lack of humidity — both of which can spoil
the wine. (On a very old wine, say 35 or
more years old, an inch of ullage is quite
acceptable, though.) Another sign of poor
storage is leakage or stickiness at the top of
the bottle, suggesting that wine has seeped
out through the cork.
 Inspect the wine’s color, if the bottle color
permits. A white wine that is excessively
dark or dull, or a red wine that has become
quite brown, can be oxidized and too old.
(Shine a penlight flashlight through the bottle
to check the color of red wines.) But some
red wines and Sauternes can show quite a
bit of brown and still be very much alive. If
you’re not sure about the color, get advice
from someone who knows about older
wines before plunking down your money.
 If you buy at auction by telephone or online,
ask the seller to inspect the bottle and
describe its fill level and color.
 Be wary if the price of the bottle seems too
low. Often, what appears to be a bargain is
a damaged or over-the-hill wine.
 Ask wine-knowledgeable friends or mer-
chants about the particular wines that you
are considering buying. Frequently, some-
one will be familiar with them.
 Say a prayer, take out your corkscrew, and
plunge in. Live dangerously!

New York is currently one of the hottest wine auction markets around. (You can
either sell or buy wines at auction.) Four large retail stores lead the crusade:
Morrell & Company, Sherry-Lehmann, Zachy’s, and Acker, Merrall & Condit.
(Contact information for all these stores is listed in the section, “Some U.S.
wine stores worth knowing,” later in this chapter.) Sotheby’s Auction House
(212-606-7050, www.sothebys.com/wine) also holds wine auctions, under
the direction of Serena Sutcliffe, MW; Christie’s Auction House (212-636-2270,
www.christies.com) is also a major player.
In Illinois, The Chicago Wine Company (708-647-8789, www.tcwc.com) and
Hart Davis Hart (312-482-9996; www.hdhwine.com) are leading auction houses.
In California, leaders include Butterfield’s Auction House (800-223-2854, ext.
3550, www.butterfields.com), The Rare Wine Company (800-999-4342,
www.rarewineco.com), and Christie’s Los Angeles (310-385-2603).
You can also bid for wine online. Winebid.com (www.winebid.com) con-
ducts auctions at its Web site. Acker, Merrall & Condit, a wine shop in New
York City that conducts live auctions, also conducts an auction online at
www.ackerwines.com during the first 12 days of each month; these auc-
tions feature odd lots not suitable for the shop’s live auctions.
Buying wine by catalog or Internet
A real plus to buying wine online or perusing wine shop catalogs and order-
ing from your armchair is, of course, the convenience (not to mention the
time savings). Most major wine retail stores have good Web sites and issue
a wine catalog two or more times a year to customers on their mailing lists;
just give a call to obtain a free catalog.
Other advantages of buying wine long-distance include the availability of
scarce wines and (sometimes) lower prices than you might pay in your
home market.
Sometimes, the only way to buy certain wines is by catalog, because sought-
after wines made in small quantities aren’t available in every market. If a wine
you want is available locally, but you don’t live in a market where pricing is
competitive, you may decide that you can save money by ordering the wine
from a retailer in another city — even after the added shipping costs.
One minor disadvantage of buying wine by catalog or online is that an adult
usually must be available to receive the wine. Also, because wine is perish-
able, you have to make certain that it’s not delivered to you during hot
(above 75°F/24°C) or cold (below 28°F/-2°C) weather. Spring and autumn
are usually the best times for wine deliveries.

Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine
Crossing state lines
Because wine contains alcohol, it doesn’t move
as freely through commercial channels as other
products do. Each state must decide whether to
permit wineries and stores outside its borders
to ship wine to its residents or not, and under
which conditions. By requiring consumers to
buy wine only from local, licensed retail stores
or wineries, a state government can be sure it’s
getting all the tax revenue it’s entitled to on
every wine transaction in its jurisdiction.
A ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 shot
down some of the restrictions that individual
states had placed on wine shipments to con-
sumers from businesses in other states, and
sent lawmakers in many states scurrying to
rewrite their regulations. As of mid-2006, the
dust created by the Supreme Court decision had
not yet settled.
Most wine shops and wineries are sympathetic
to out-of-state customers, but out-of-state deliv-
eries are risky for their businesses, depending on
the regulations in their state and the destination
state. The risk is all theirs, too; the store or winery
can lose its license, while all the buyer loses is
any wine that’s confiscated by the authorities.
If you want to buy wine from an out-of-state
winery or merchant, discuss the issue with the
people there. If shipping to you isn’t legal, they
can sometimes find a solution for you, such as
holding the wine for you to pick up personally,
or shipping to a friend or relative in a legal state.
Buy all the wine you want when you visit a
winery: Different rules apply, and wine drinkers
may legally ship home wines that they purchase
during visits to out-of-state wineries.

Wine online
The major Web sites for purchasing wine online are those of actual bricks-

“Some U.S. wine stores worth knowing.” Here are another few Internet sites
worth checking out when you want to purchase wine online.
 Wine Access (www.wineaccess.com): This site calls itself a “wine
shopping community” and in fact it is a mall of sorts, where you can 
purchase wine from numerous participating wine shops across the
United States or from participating wineries. The site contains a section
where you can read about trends and also enables you to subscribe to
some newsletters.
 K&L Wines (www.klwines.com): A critically-acclaimed Web site from a
California retailer; is easy to navigate and features a very comprehensive
inventory, knowledgeable commentary and a blog.
 Wine-Searcher (www.wine-searcher.com): This site searches for wines
that you name and lists stores and prices for them, including merchants
outside the United States.
 The Wine Web (www.wineweb.com). A site that enables you to buy wine
through participating retailers or wineries.

Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine

The Urge to Own: Wine Collecting
Most people consume wines very quickly after buying them. If this is your
custom, you have plenty of company. But many people who enjoy wine 
operate a bit differently. Oh, sure, they buy wine because they intend to
drink it; they’re just not exactly sure when they’ll drink it. And until they
do drink it, they get pleasure out of knowing that the bottles are waiting
for them. If you count yourself in this second group, you’re probably a
wine collector at heart. The chase, to you, is every bit as thrilling as the 
consummation.
If you’re a closet wine collector, developing a strategy of wine buying can 
prevent a haphazard collection of uninteresting or worthless bottles from
happening to you. (Even if you never intend to have a wine collection, it’s
worthwhile to put at least a little thought into your wine purchases.)
The first step in formulating a wine-buying strategy is to consider
316
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
Buying time: Wine futures
Every so often you may notice ads in the news-
paper or in wine catalogs urging you to buy
futures of certain wines (usually Bordeaux, but
sometimes California wines). The ads suggest
that, to ensure getting a particular wine at the
lowest price, you should buy it now for future
delivery. In other words, “Give us your money
now; you’ll get the wine in due course, probably
sometime next year when the winery releases it.”
Generally, we recommend that you don’t buy
futures. Often the wine will be the same price,
or only slightly higher, when it hits the market.
To save little or nothing, you will have tied your
money up for a year or more, while the store has
made interest on it or spent it. Stores have gone
bankrupt. And during recessionary economies
in the past, some people who bought wine
futures actually paid more for their wine than
they would have paid if they had waited for the
wine to arrive before purchasing it.
Futures are useful only in two situations: For
wines that are made in such small quantity that
you’re pretty sure the wine will sell out before it
reaches the stores; and for a wine that receives
an extraordinarily high rating in the wine press
before its release, assuring that its price could
double and even triple by the time the wine
reaches the market.
Here’s the bottom line: Buy futures only when
you must have a particular wine and buying
futures may be the only way you can get it. For
most wines, though, keep your wallet in your
pocket until the wine is actually available.

 How much wine you drink
 How much wine you want to own (and can store properly)
 How much money you’re prepared to spend on wine
 What types of wine you enjoy drinking
Unless you strike a balance on these issues, you can end up broke, bored,
frustrated, or in the vinegar business!
Balancing your inventory
Unless your intention is to fill your cellar with wines that bring you the great-
est return on investment when you later sell them — in other words, unless
you aren’t interested in actually drinking the wines you own — you should
like a wine before buying it. (We’re not talking about all those bottles you
buy while you’re playing the field and experimenting with new wines — just
those that you’re thinking of making a commitment to by buying in quantity.)
Liking a wine before you buy it sounds like the plainest common sense, but
you’d be surprised at how many people buy a wine merely because somebody
gave it a high rating!
A well-planned wine inventory features a range of wines. It can be heavy in
one or two types of wine that you particularly enjoy, but it has other types of
wine, too. If you like California Cabernet Sauvignons, for example, you may
decide to make them your specialty. But consider that you may grow weary
of them if you have nothing else to drink night after night. By purchasing
other wines as well, you can have the fun of exploring different types of wine.
Table wines, of course, are the bulk of most wine collections. But it’s a good
idea to have a few apéritif wines — such as Champagne or dry Sherry — and
dessert wines — such as Port or sweet white wines — so that you’re prepared
when occasions arise. (If you’re like us, you’ll invent plenty of occasions to
open a bottle of Champagne!)
Another hallmark of a balanced collection is a healthy selection of both 
inexpensive wines ($8 to $18 a bottle) that can be enjoyed on casual occa-
sions and important wines that demand a special occasion. Purchasing only
expensive wines is unrealistic. You need wines that you can open at any time,
with anyone.
You also want to purchase wines that are ready to drink and those that require
additional aging. We give you some pointers about doing so in the next two
sections.
317
Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine

Everyday wines
What you stock as everyday wines will depend on your personal taste.
Our candidates for everyday white wines include
 Simple white Burgundies, such as Mâcon-Villages or St.Véran
 Sauvignon Blancs from New Zealand, France (Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé),
and California
 Pinot Gris/Pinot Grigio from Oregon, Alsace, and Italy
 Italian Pinot Bianco
 Flavorful Italian whites such as Vermentino, Verdicchio, or Falanghina
 Grüner Veltliner from Austria
 Riesling from Germany, Austria, or Alsace
 Moschofilero from Greece
 Albariños from Spain
For everyday red wines, we especially like Italian reds such as Barbera,
Dolcetto, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, Valpolicella, and simple (under $20)
Chianti. These red wines are enjoyable young, versatile enough to go well with
the simple, flavorful foods many people eat everyday, and sturdy enough to
age for a couple of years if you don’t get around to them (that is, they won’t
deteriorate quickly).
Other everyday red wines we recommend include Beaujolais, Côtes du
Rhône, and lighter-bodied (under $15) Bordeaux.
Age-worthy wines
In planning your own wine collection, include some age-worthy wines that
you buy in their youth when their prices are lowest. Many of the better red
wines, such as Bordeaux, Barolo, and Hermitage, often aren’t at their best for at
318
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
Is the sky the limit?
Some wine collectors own more than 10,000 bot-
tles! This might be called taking one’s hobby to
the extreme. We believe that a collection of 1,000
to 1,500 bottles is definitely sufficient to handle
anyone’s needs nicely. Then again, 100 bottles
isn’t so bad, either!

least ten years after the vintage — and some of them are difficult to find once
they are ready to drink. Aging is also the rule for some fine white Burgundies
(such as Corton-Charlemagne), better white Bordeaux, Sauternes, German
Rieslings and late-harvest wines, and Vintage Port, which usually requires
about 20 years of aging before it matures!
Age-worthy white wines we recommend include
 Above all, grand cru and premier cru white Burgundies — such as
Corton-Charlemagne, Bâtard- and Chevalier-Montrachets, Meursault,
and Chablis Grand Crus
 Better (over $30) white Bordeaux
 Great German and Austrian Rieslings
 Alsace Rieslings or Gewurztraminers
See Chapters 9 and 11 for explanations of these wines.
Among the many long-lived red wines, some likely candidates for cellaring
(the term for letting wines mature) are
 Fine Bordeaux
 Grand cru and premier cru Burgundies
 Big Italian reds, such as Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico Riserva,
Brunello di Montalcino, Taurasi, and Super-Tuscan blends
 From Spain: Rioja, Ribeira del Duero, and Priorato wines
 From California: Better Cabernet Sauvignons (and Cabernet blends)
 From the Rhône: Hermitage, Côte Rôtie, and Cornas
 Portugal’s Barca Velha, and other good Douro table wines
 Australia’s Grange (Penfolds), the Henschke Shiraz wines, such as Hill of
Grace, and other super-premium Shirazes
Other age-worthy wines include
 Finer Champagnes (usually Vintage Champagnes and prestige cuvées;
see Chapter 14)
 The finest dessert wines, such as late-harvest German Rieslings (see
Chapter 11), French Sauternes, sweet Vouvrays from the Loire Valley
(see Chapter 9), Vintage Port, and Madeira. (See Chapter 15 for
Sauternes, Port, and Madeira.)

Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine

Organization is peace of mind
When you’re not only a wine drinker but also a wine collector, you become
aware that you need to keep track of all your wine so that
 You can find a bottle quickly when you’re looking for it.
 You know what you own. (Many a bottle has gone over the hill because
the owner forgot that he had it!)
 You can show off your wine collection to your friends (something like
showing your baby’s pictures).
You can keep track of your wine in many different ways. A wine inventory on
paper should include a list of the specific wines in your collection, the number
of each, and the location.
Cataloging our wine collection by computer turned out to be a lot easier than
we expected. We used a database program (Filemaker, specifically) on our Mac
to create the file. We set up a field for each of the following items:
320
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
The charm of an aged wine
Aged wines are a thing apart from young
wines — and some wines don’t really reach their
full expression until they have aged. Try drinking a
highly acclaimed young red Bordeaux, say a 1996
Château Lafite-Rothschild. You taste a mouthful of
tannin, and although the wine has concentration,
you probably wonder what all the fuss is about.
Try it in 10 to 15 years; the assertive tannins have
softened, a wonderful bouquet of cedar, tobacco,
and black currants emerges from the glass, and
a natural sweetness of flavor has developed.
As a fine wine matures in the bottle, a series of
chemical and physical changes occur. These
changes are poorly understood, but their effects
are evident in the style of a mature red wine:
 The wine becomes paler in color.
 Its aroma evolves from the fruity aromas
(and often oakiness) it had when young to a
complex leathery and earthy bouquet.
 Its tannic, harsh texture diminishes, and the
wine becomes silky.
Mature wines seem to be easier to digest, and
they go to your head less quickly. (Perhaps that’s
because we tend to drink them slowly, with rev-
erence.) Besides visceral pleasure, they offer a
special emotional satisfaction. Tasting an aged
wine can be like traveling back in time, sharing
a connection with people who have gone
before in the great chain of humanity.

A Healthy Environment for Your Wines
If you’ve decided to collect wine — or if you discover that a wine collection is
happening to you — please take heed: Poorly stored wines make disappoint-
ment after disappointment inevitable.
If you plan to keep wines indefinitely, you really need a wine storage facility with
controlled temperature and humidity. This is especially important if you live
where the temperature exceeds 70°F (21°C) for any length of time. Without
proper storage, you may be tempted to drink those fine wines long before they
reach their best drinking period (known in wine circles as infanticide), or worse
yet, the wines may die an untimely death in your closet, garage, or warm cellar.
The passive wine cellar
You may be fortunate enough to have conditions suitable for what is called a pas-
sive wine cellar (if you’ve recently inherited a castle in Scotland, for example).
321
Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine

If the place where you intend to store your wine is very cool (below 60°F,
15.5°C) and very damp (75 percent humidity or higher) year-round, you can
be the lucky owner of a passive cellar. (It’s called passive because you don’t
have to do anything to it, such as cool it or humidify it.) Usually, only deep
cellars completely below ground level with thick stones or comparable insu-
lation can be completely passive in temperate climates. Passive cellars are
certainly the ideal way to store wines. And you can save a lot of money on
their upkeep, to boot.
If you don’t have a space that’s already ideal for a passive wine cellar, you
might decide that you can dig one. For instructions on building your own 
passive wine cellar, see Richard M. Gold’s authoritative book, How and Why
To Build a Passive Wine Cellar, Third Edition (Sandhill Publishers).
If you can’t be passive, be bullish
Most of us are neither lucky enough to have a passive wine cellar nor fortunate
enough to be able to create one without extraordinary expense and trouble
(bulldozers, wrecking crews, and so on). But second best — an artificially
cooled and/or humidified room — is far better than nothing.
The following are key features of a good wine storage area:
 The temperature stays cool — ideally, in the 53° to 59°F range 
(12° to 16°C).
 The temperature is fairly constant — wide swings in temperature are not
good for the wine.
 The area is damp or humid, with a minimum of 70 percent humidity and
a maximum of 95 percent (mold sets in above 95 percent).
 The area is free from vibrations, which can travel through the wine;
heavy traffic and motors cycling on and off — such as in refrigerators
or washers/dryers — are detrimental to your wine.
 The area is free from light, especially direct sunlight; the ultraviolet rays
of the sun are especially harmful to wine.
 The storage area is free from chemical odors, such as paints, paint
remover, and so on.
We built a room in our cellar for wine storage. Whatever area you use, your
wine will keep well provided that the space has a climate control unit and is
properly insulated (see the following sections in this chapter).
322
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

Buy a hygrometer (an instrument that measures humidity) for your wine 
storage area. Our hygrometer gives us both the percentage of humidity and a
digital reading of the temperature — information so valuable that we check it
almost daily. (Hygrometers are available through wine accessory catalogs,
such as The Wine Enthusiast, Pleasantville, NY, % 800-356-8466.)
Avoid refrigerators for wine storage. Don’t leave good wine or Champagne
in the refrigerator for more than a week; not only is the refrigerator motor
harmful, but the excessively cold temperature (as low as 35°F, 1.6°C) tends
to numb and flatten the flavors of the wine.
Climate control
Professional cooling units are available. (Find them advertised in wine acces-
sory catalogs and wine magazines.) These are climate-control devices that
humidify the air of a room as well as cool it. These units come in various
capacities to suit rooms of different dimensions. Many require professional
installation; they cost from $600 to $2,400, depending on their capacity.
Depending on where you live, you may not need to run your cooling unit all
year. We live in the northeastern United States and keep ours going from
about mid-May to October. The additional expense for electricity comes to
about $20 a month for four to five months — well worth it when we consider
the value of the wine we’re protecting. During the winter months when the air
gets dry, we often run a humidifier in our wine room.
Wine racks
Racking systems vary from elaborate redwood racks to simple metal or plas-
tic types. The choice of material and configuration really hinges on how
much you want to spend and your own personal taste.
323
Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine
The issue of humidity
Some wine collectors are not particularly con-
cerned about the humidity level of their cellars.
High humidity causes mold, they argue, and dis-
figures labels. But dry air can dry the cork and
allow the airtight seal to deteriorate, enabling
oxygen to get in or causing your wine to evapo-
rate or leech out around the cork, resulting in
excessive ullage (space between the wine and
the cork). The greater the ullage, the greater the
chance of your wine’s becoming oxidized.
Because we recommend humidity between 70
and 95 percent, we believe that air conditioners,
which dehumidify the air to about 50 percent,
are not suitable for wine storage areas.

Large, diamond-shaped wooden (or synthetic composition) racks are popular
because they efficiently store up to eight bottles per section and make maxi-
mum use of space (see Figure 16-1). Such racks also permit the easy removal
of individual bottles.

A rack configuration that gives each wine its own cubbyhole is more expen-
sive; if you’re checking out such racks, consider whether any of your over-
sized bottles (such as bulbous sparkling wine bottles) may be too large to fit
the racks. (And consider whether your half-bottles may be too small!)
Some collectors prefer to store their wine in the wines’ original wooden
crates. (Many classic wines, such as Bordeaux and Vintage Port, come in
these crates; you can also usually pick up empty wooden crates in wine
stores.) The crates are beneficial for storing wine because the wine remains
in a dark environment inside the case, and the temperature changes very

shaped

slowly thanks to the mass of wine bottles packed together in the closed case.
Retrieving a bottle from the bottom row of the case can really be inconve-
nient, though.
Cardboard boxes aren’t suitable for wine storage. The chemicals used in the
manufacture of the cardboard can eventually affect the wine. Also, the card-
board boxes become damaged, in time, from the moisture in the air, assuming
that you’re maintaining a proper humidity in your cellar.
Insulation
Far more important than your choice of racks is your choice of insulation.
We definitely do not recommend fiberglass insulation because it will absorb
the moisture created by your cooling unit. We’ve heard of cases in which the
weight of the moisture inside the insulation actually caused parts of ceilings
to come tumbling down, creating quite a mess.
The ideal insulation is a 3-inch-thick, thermoplastic resin called polyurethane.
It’s odorless, doesn’t absorb moisture, and makes a fine seal. Even when a
cooling unit isn’t running, temperatures will change extremely slowly in most
wine rooms with this kind of insulation.
Wine caves for apartment dwellers
If you live in a house that has either a cellar or a separate area for your wine,
consider yourself fortunate. What if you have no space — for instance, if you
live in an apartment?
As an apartment dweller, you have three choices:
 Leave your wine in a friend’s or relative’s house (provided that he has
adequate storage facilities — and that you trust him or her not to drink
your wine!).
 Rent storage space in a refrigerated public warehouse.
 Buy a wine cave — also known as a wine vault — a self-contained, refrig-
erated unit that you plug into an electrical outlet.
We find the first two options barely acceptable because they don’t give you
immediate access to your wine. It’s downright inconvenient to make a trip
every time you want to get your hands on your own wine. And both of these
options rob you of the pleasure of having your wines readily available in your
home where you can look at them, fondle the bottles, or show them off to
your friends.
325
Chapter 16: Buying and Collecting Wine

If we lived in an apartment, we’d definitely own a wine cave. Many wine caves
resemble attractive pieces of furniture, either vertical or horizontal credenzas.
Some have glass doors, and all of them can be locked.
Wine caves range in size and capacity from a tiny unit that holds only 24 bottles
to really large units that hold up to 2,800 bottles, with many sizes in between.
Prices range from $300 to about $8,000. You find wine caves advertised exten-
sively in wine accessory catalogs and in the back pages of wine magazines.
If you plan to build a wine cellar or buy a wine cave, allow for expansion in
your wine collection. Like most waistlines, wine cellars inevitably grow larger
with the passing years.

L
earning about wine is like space travel: Once you get going, there’s no
end in sight. Fortunately for those who choose to be educated wine
drinkers, learning about wine is a fascinating experience, full of new flavors,
new places, and new friends.
Although we teach others about wine, we are also avid students of wine.
We can’t imagine that we’ll ever reach the point where we say, “Now we know
enough about wine; we can stop here.” So off we go to another vineyard,
to another wine tasting, or deep into the pages of another wine magazine.
Every step brings not only more knowledge but also more appreciation of
this amazing beverage.
Back to the Classroom
The best way to learn about wine and to improve your wine-tasting skills is to
take a wine course. Wine classes provide the ideal combination of authoritative
instruction and immediate feedback on your tasting impressions.
If you live in a medium-sized or large city, you’re sure to find several wine
courses offered by private individuals, by universities, by local school dis-
tricts as adult-education extension programs, or by local wine shops or
restaurants.

Most wine courses are wine appreciation courses — they don’t teach you
how to make wine, they don’t usually provide you with professional creden-
tials, and they’re not accredited. (Some professional-level courses and
courses offered at an actual university can be exceptions.) The purpose of
most wine courses is to provide both information about wine and practice in
tasting wine. (For information on professional wine credentials, see “One wine
school in action” and “What do the initials MW mean?” later in this chapter.)
Introductory classes deal with wine grape varieties and how to taste wine,
while more advanced classes discuss in depth the various wine regions of the
world or the wines of a particular region. Instructors are usually experienced
professionals who work in the wine trade or who write about wine.
Brand promotion and education often enjoy too cozy a relationship in the
wine field. Many wine instructors, such as distributor salespeople or winery
reps, have a vested interest in the brands of wine that they offer as tasting
samples in class. As long as the instructor has expertise beyond his or her
own brands, you can still benefit from the instruction. But you should request
disclosure of any commercial affiliations at the first class. And when possible,
consider taking classes from independent instructors instead.
One wine school in action
The following announcement is a shameless plug: We run a wine school in New
York City called International Wine Center (www.internationalwinecenter.
com). We offer the programs of the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET®),
the leading international wine education organization; they’re geared towards
people in the wine trade but are open to anyone who is serious about learning.
Unlike courses geared only toward wine drinkers — where entertainment is
as much a goal as education — courses for wine professionals are more com-
prehensive, and the information covered is more technical. For example, our
WSET courses cover three levels of study (from beginner to very advanced)
and range from 8 to 40 sessions in length; each course has a textbook, self-study
materials, and an examination. Students who pass the exam corresponding to
their level of study earn a certificate that gives them professional credentials.
But whether they target wine lovers or those in the trade, most wine classes
have a lot in common. A typical class usually lasts about two hours; students
listen to a lecture on a particular topic and taste six to eight wines related to
that topic. The instructor encourages questions. References to maps of wine
regions or sketches on the blackboard punctuate the discussion.
328
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

At most wine classes, each student sits before a place setting of wine glasses —
ideally one glass per wine to be tasted. Water and crackers are available to help
students clear their palates between tastes of wine. Next to each student should
be a large plastic cup for dumping leftover wine. Each student should receive
a printed list of the wines being tasted, as well as other material about the
subject of that particular class session.
For the name of a wine school or an individual who offers wine programs in
your area, contact the Society of Wine Educators, Washington, DC (% 202-
347-5677), which has members throughout the United States, Canada, and
some other countries. The Society offers wine instructors the opportunity to
become Certified Wine Educators, and those who pass that exam are entitled
to identify themselves with the initials CWE — a credential to look for when
choosing a wine course.
Wine tastings of all shapes and sizes
Wine tastings are events designed to give enthusiasts the opportunity to sample
a range of wines. The events can be very much like classes (seated, seminar-like
events), or they can be more like parties (tasters milling around informally).
Compared to a wine class, the participants at a wine tasting are more likely to
have mixed levels of knowledge. Tastings don’t come in beginner, intermediate,
and advanced levels — one size fits all.
Wine tastings are popular because they override the limitations of sampling
wine alone, at home. How many wines can you taste on your own (unless you
don’t mind throwing away nine-tenths of every bottle)? How many wines are
you willing to buy on your own? And how much can you learn tasting wine in
isolation — or with a friend whose expertise is no greater than yours?
At wine tastings, you can learn from your fellow tasters, as well as make new
friends who share your interest in wine. Most importantly, you can taste wine
in the company of some individuals who are more experienced than you,
which is a real boon in training your palate.
We have led or attended literally thousands of wine tastings in our lives — so
far. And it’s fair to say that we’ve learned something about wine at almost all
of them.
To attend a wine tasting in your area, contact your wine merchant. Your local
shop may sponsor wine-tasting events occasionally (apart from the informal
sampling opportunities in the store itself) and should also be aware of wine
schools or other organizations that conduct wine tastings in your area.
329
Chapter 17: Continuing Education for Wine Lovers

When in Rome . . .
If you’ve never been to a wine tasting, we should warn you that a few matters
of etiquette apply at most tastings. Familiarizing yourself with this etiquette
will help you feel more comfortable. Otherwise, you’re likely to be appalled
by what you see or hear. Why are those people behaving like that?!
To spit or not to spit?
Remember we mentioned a large, plastic cup that each student in a wine
class has for dumping out his leftover wine? Well, we lied. (We wanted to ease
you into what we realize may be a shocking concept.) The cup is really for
students to spit out the wine after tasting it.
Professional wine tasters long ago discovered that if they swallow every wine
they taste, they’re far less thoughtful tasters by the time they reach wine nine
or ten. So spitting became acceptable. In working wineries, professional tasters
sometimes spit right onto the gravel floor or into the drains. In more elegant
surroundings, they spit into a spittoon, usually a simple container like a large
plastic cup (one per taster) or an ice bucket that two or three tasters share.
At first, some tasters are naturally loath to spit out wine. Not only have they
been brought up to believe that spitting is uncouth, but they’ve also paid
good money for the opportunity to taste the wines. Why waste them?
Well, you can drink all your wine at a wine tasting, if you wish — and some
people do. But we don’t advise that you do, for the following reasons:
330
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
What do the initials MW mean?
You may have noticed that one of the co-authors
of this book has “Master of Wine” (often short-
ened to “MW”) after her name. Wine profes-
sionals receive this title — which is the most
respected wine credential in the world — by
passing a grueling three-part exam. The Institute
of Masters of Wine awards the credential; it
offers preparatory programs and/or exams in
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom,
and continental Europe. A high level of knowl-
edge, experience in the wine trade, and comple-
tion of any locally-available wine courses, such
as the WSET programs, are the normal prereq-
uisites. As of this writing, there are 251 Masters
of Wine in the world (22 in North America).
For more information, visit the Institute online at
www.masters-of-wine.org.

 Evaluating the later wines is difficult if you swallow the earlier ones. The
alcohol you consume clouds your judgment.
 Swallowing is not really necessary in order to taste the wine fully. If you
leave the wine in your mouth for eight to ten seconds (see Chapter 2),
you are able to taste it thoroughly — without having to worry about the
effects of the alcohol.
 If you are driving to the tasting, you’re taking a risk driving home after-
wards if you drink instead of spit. The stakes are high — your life and
health, others’ lives, and your driver’s license. Why gamble?
The simple solution: Spit out the wine. Just about all experienced wine
tasters do. Believe it or not, spitting will seem to be a very normal thing to
do at wine tastings after a while. (And, in the meantime, it’s one sure way to
appear more experienced than you are!)
If you know that you can’t bring yourself to spit, be sure to have something
substantial to eat before going to a wine tasting. You absorb alcohol more
slowly on a full stomach — and the simple crackers and bread at most wine
tastings aren’t sufficient to do the trick.
What’s with the sound effects?
Do you have to make that loud slurping or gurgling noise that you hear 
“serious” wine tasters make at tastings?
Of course you don’t. But drawing air into your mouth does enhance your 
ability to taste the wine (as explained in Chapter 2). With a little practice,
you can gurgle without making loud, attention-getting noises.
331
Chapter 17: Continuing Education for Wine Lovers
Horizontal or vertical?
Two of the goofiest expressions in the world of
wine apply to wine tastings. Depending on the
nature of the wines featured, wine-tasting
events can be categorized as vertical tastings
or as horizontal tastings. These categories have
nothing to do with the position of the tasters
themselves — they’re usually seated, and
they’re never lying down (that went out of fash-
ion after the Romans).
A vertical tasting is a wine tasting featuring sev-
eral vintages of the same wine — Château
Latour in each vintage from 1988 to 1998, for
example. A horizontal tasting examines wines
of a single vintage from several different winer-
ies; usually the wines are of a similar type, such
as 2002 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons.
There’s no particular name for tastings with less
disciplined themes, but we suggest paisley.

More fine points of wine etiquette
Because smell is such an important aspect of wine tasting, courteous tasters
try not to interfere with other tasters’ ability to smell. This means
 Smoking (anything) is a complete no-no at any wine tasting.
 Using any scent (perfume, after-shave lotion, scented hair spray, and so
on) is unacceptable. These foreign odors can really interfere with your
fellow tasters’ ability to detect the wine’s aroma.
Courteous wine tasters also don’t volunteer their opinions about a wine until
other tasters have had a chance to taste the wine. Serious tasters like to form
their opinions independently and are sure to throw dirty looks at anyone who
interrupts their concentration.
Most of these wine-tasting etiquette guidelines apply to wine classes as
well — and are also relevant when you visit wineries around the world.
Dinner with the winemaker
A popular type of wine event is the winemaker dinner, a multicourse dinner at
which a winemaker or winery executive is the guest of honor. Wine drinkers
pay a fixed price for the meal and taste various wines from the featured winery
that are matched to each course.
As far as learning goes, winemaker dinners rank below seminar-style wine
tastings but above many informal, reception-style tastings. These dinners
offer the chance to taste wines under ideal circumstances — with food — but
we find that most speakers disseminate very little information of any value
and give you little opportunity to ask questions.
332
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
Blind man’s bluff
One of the favorite diversions of wine tasters is
tasting wines blind. Before you conjure up
thoughts of darkened rooms, blindfolded tasters,
or other forms of hanky-panky, let us explain
that the tasters are not blind, the bottles are. Or
anyway, the bottles have their faces covered.
In blind tastings, the tasters don’t know the iden-
tities of the wines. The theory behind this exercise
is that knowing the identities may prejudice the
tasters to prefer (or dislike) a particular wine for
its reputation rather than for “what’s in the glass,”
as they say. Sometimes, extremely skilled tasters
taste wines blind and try to identify them, in an
effort to sharpen their tasting skills even further.
If you don’t know enough about wine to be prej-
udiced by the labels, there’s little point in tasting
blind. Nevertheless, there’s something about
blind tasting that really helps you focus your con-
centration on what you’re tasting — and that’s
always good practice.

In their potential for fun, however, winemaker dinners are right up there at
the top of the list — even if you don’t get to sit next to the winemaker.
Visiting the wineries
One of the best — and most fun-filled — ways to learn about wine is to 
actually visit wine regions and, if possible, speak to the winemakers and 
producers about their wines. You get to immerse yourself in the region you
visit — experiencing the climate firsthand, seeing the soil and the hills,
touching the grapes, and so on. You can walk through the vineyards if you
wish, visit nearby towns or villages, eat the local food, and drink the wine of
the region.
You discover that there’s something special about the people who devote
their lives to making wine. Maybe it’s their creativity or their commitment to
bringing pleasure to the world through their labor. Whatever the reason, they
are exceptional people. We have found some of our dearest friends in wine
regions throughout the world.
Appointments definitely in order
When you do plan to visit a winery, you usually need to call or write ahead
for an appointment.
The major exceptions are a few of the large wineries in California that offer
scheduled tours or self-guided visits. Many wineries in the United States do
have tasting rooms that are open every day during the busy tourism months
and on weekends during the winter. In these tasting rooms, you can sample
wines (sometimes for a small fee), buy wine, and buy souvenirs such as 
T-shirts or sweatshirts with the logo of the winery imprinted on them.
If you visit wineries that are less geared toward tourism — which is the case
in most of the rest of the wine world — you can simply sample the wines, talk
to the winemaker or proprietor when he’s available (you have made an
appointment, right?), take an informal tour of the winery, and buy some wine
if you wish (an especially nice idea if the wine isn’t available back home).
Don’t know the language? No problema
Don’t let your limited (or nonexistent) ability to speak the local language 
prevent you from visiting wine regions. These days, English is the nearly uni-
versal language of the wine world. Even if the person you’re visiting doesn’t
speak English, he invariably has someone available (his wife, his son, or his
dog) who does. Besides, wine itself is a universal language. A smile and a
handshake go a long way towards communicating!

Armchair Travel
Traveling around the world takes time and money. Alternatively, you can
travel through the wine world from the comfort of your living room, letting
the written word carry you to faraway wine regions. Many retail wine stores
sell wine magazines, newsletters, and books. You can also find wine books in
or near the cooking section of most book stores.
Recommended books
The following books are some of the established tomes; they take you into
great depth on particular aspects of wine. 
General knowledge
Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson, MW, World Atlas of Wine, Fifth Edition,
London, Mitchell Beazley, 2001. Johnson and Robinson, both English, are
probably the world’s most respected wine writers. Complete with detailed
maps of all the world’s wine regions, this book is essential for any serious
wine lover’s library. (Hugh Johnson’s Wine Companion and Pocket Encyclopedia
of Wine are two additional worthwhile books by Hugh Johnson.)
Oz Clarke, Oz Clarke’s New Encyclopedia of Wine, New York, Harcourt, 1999.
Oz Clarke is undoubtedly the wine world’s most prolific wine writer — the
Stephen King of winedom. This comprehensive encyclopedia is well organized
and up-to-date. A great wine reference book. (Oz Clarke’s Encyclopedia of
Grapes is also worthwhile.)
Jancis Robinson, MW (editor), The Oxford Companion to Wine, Second
Edition, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1999. An encyclopedic reference
book that sets the standard in the wine field. We would expect no less from
Robinson, one of the truly brilliant wine writers. This book is a “must” for all
serious students of wine. A Third Edition is scheduled for 2006 publication.
(Also check out Robinson’s Vines, Grapes, and Wines, published by Alfred A.
Knopf.)
Bordeaux
Robert M. Parker, Jr., Bordeaux, Fourth Edition, New York, Simon & Schuster,
2003. Robert Parker is certainly America’s — if not the world’s — most famous
wine writer. He earned his reputation for his knowledge of Bordeaux; he was
also the first writer to use the 100-point wine rating system. This fourth edition
covers all major Bordeaux wines from 1961 to 2002, with info on wines dating
back to 1945 — an essential book for any Bordeaux lover. (Anther book by
Parker worth having is The Wines of the Rhône Valley, Second Edition, 1997.)
334
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

David Peppercorn MW, Wines of Bordeaux, Revised Edition, London, Mitchell
Beazley, 2004. England’s David Peppercorn is rightfully regarded as one of the
great Bordeaux experts. In this succinctly written wine guide, Peppercorn
offers his own ratings of Bordeaux wines, when to drink them, and which
ones are particularly good values.
Burgundy and the Rhône Valley
Anthony Hanson, MW, Burgundy, London, Mitchell Beazley, 2004. Hanson has
written a succinct, excellent work on this very complicated wine region.
Clive Coates, MW, Côte d’Or, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1997.
This may be the prolific Mr. Coates’ best book yet on his favorite wine region.
Coates, another one of the fine corps of British wine writers, covers all the
major districts of the Côte d’Or (which is the home of all the great red and
white Burgundy wines; see Chapter 9), reviews all the producers, and provides
detailed information on vintages. A thorough reference book on Burgundy.
(Also worth reading is Coates’ book on Bordeaux, Grands Vins, and his
The Wines of France.)
Remington Norman, MW, Rhône Renaissance, San Francisco, The Wine
Appreciation Guild Ltd., 1997. This is a much-needed book on a region
that has gone through major changes in recent years.
Champagne

Edition, San Francisco, The Wine Appreciation Guild Ltd., 2003. England’s
Tom Stevenson knows more about Champagne than the Champenois them-
selves! A complete look at Champagne and all the major sparkling wines of
the world.
Richard Juhlin, 4000 Champagnes, Paris, Flammarion, 2005. Juhlin, an extremely
knowledgeable Swedish lover of Champagne, gives his own very personalized
views of the Champagne houses. Thorough and comprehensive.
Old and rare wines
Michael Broadbent, MW, Michael Broadbent’s Vintage Wine, New York,
Harcourt, 2002. No one has tasted more great wines, especially old and rare
ones, than England’s Michael Broadbent. This guide to vintage wines going
back to the nineteenth century concentrates on Bordeaux, Sauternes, and
Burgundy. This is a book for the advanced wine buff. Great stuff from one of
the world’s greatest French wine connoisseurs.

dations in this book carry the ring of authority that only one with Anderson’s
vast experience can deliver.
Germany
Stuart Pigott, The Wine Atlas of Germany, London, Mitchell Beazley, 1996.
Although British, Pigott lives in Germany and is regarded as one of the lead-
ing experts writing about the intricacies of German wine. The series editor of
this atlas is Hugh Johnson, another German wine lover and a man who knows
something about putting together wine atlases. An excellent reference for
German wines.
Spain
Jeremy Watson, The New and Classical Wines of Spain, Barcelona, Montagud
Editores, 2002. Watson has performed a great service in providing the wine
world with a modern, comprehensive reference on one of the world’s great

2002. Cooper is arguably the world’s leading authority on New Zealand’s
wines. This comprehensive tome is required reading for all New Zealand
wine lovers.
Wine magazines and newsletters
Wine magazines and newsletters can provide more topical information about
wine than books can. They keep you up-to-date on the current happenings in
the wine world, give you timely tasting notes on newly released wines, profile
the currently hot wines and winemakers, and so on. Also, the classified ads in
the back of most wine magazines are a good way to hear about wine-related
equipment for sale, wine tours, and other useful offers.
Some magazines that we recommend include
 Decanter: One of the oldest and one of the best, this magazine covers the
world but is especially strong on French and Italian wines. Decanter also
frequently issues supplements on major wine regions as part of your
subscription. It’s published monthly in London. % 800-875-2997 (U.S.) or
1444-475675 (U.K.); www.decanter.com.
 Wine Spectator: Much of the current wine news is in the Spectator, but it
also includes rather extensive coverage of the world’s major wine regions,
with plenty of tasting notes. This magazine is published twice monthly.

Wine newsletters usually express the personal opinion of one authoritative
writer. They contain mainly wine-tasting notes, whereas magazines contain
feature-length articles along with tasting notes. One nice thing about many
newsletters is that they accept no advertising; thus, they can maintain (in
theory, at least) more impartiality than magazines. Most wine newsletters are
intended for the intermediate to advanced wine buff.

wine from Internet sites. Most wineries and some wine importers have their
own sites, as do several wine magazines. Other sites feature groups of winer-
ies. Here are some of our favorite places to read about, or chat about, wine
online.
 Wine Review Online (www.winereviewonline.com): Robert Whitley,
a San Diego-based wine writer and radio wine show host, is publisher
of this new, free, bi-monthly newsletter, edited by Michael Franz.

 Ways to be a more thoughtful taster
 Tips for writing tasting notes
 Numeric shorthand for wine quality
W
hen we first got excited about wine, we tried to share our enthusiasm
with a relative who appeared to have some interest in the subject
(well, he drank a glass now and then). Each time we served a wine, we’d talk
about it in great detail. But he wasn’t interested. “I don’t want to talk about
wine — I just want to drink it!” he proclaimed.
On some fundamental level where wine is just a generic beverage, it’s certainly
possible to drink wine without talking about it. But if you’re the kind of person
who likes to talk about food, or if you’ve been bitten by the wine bug, you know
that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to enjoy wine without talking about it at
least a little. Wine is a social pleasure that’s enhanced by sharing with others.
Ironically, the experience of a wine is highly personal. If you and three other
people taste the same wine at the same time, each of you will have your own
impression of that wine based on personal likes and dislikes, physiology, and
experience. Maybe some day, if humans learn how to link their minds through
WiFi, someone else will be able to experience your experience of a wine —
but until then, your taste is singular. The only way you can share your
impressions with others is through conversation.
Words Cannot Describe . . .
Language is our main vehicle for communicating our entire experience of life.
Our vocabulary of taste is undeveloped, however. When we were young, we
were taught a visual vocabulary: what is green, yellow, gold, and orange —
and for that matter, what is pine green, jungle green, olive green, forest green,
and sea green (thanks, Crayola!). No one ever taught us the precise difference
in the words bitter, astringent, and tart. Yet to talk about wine taste, we use
these words as if we all agree on what they mean.

Any discussion of wine’s taste is particularly complicated, because wine is a
complex beverage that gives us multiple taste sensations:
 Olfactory sensations (all those flavors we perceive by smelling them in
our mouths — as we discuss in Chapter 2)
 Basic taste sensations (sweetness, sourness, and bitterness)
 Tactile sensations (the bite of astringency, for example, as well as the
prickliness, roughness, smoothness, or other textural impressions of a
wine in our mouths)
 Sensations on the holistic level, a synthesis of all the wine’s characteris-
tics taken together
For example, say we just tasted an oaked Sauvignon Blanc from California.
We may perceive the wine as intense in herbaceous and fruity aromas, with
melon-like flavor (olfactory impressions), very slightly sweet, yet with firm
acidity (basic taste impressions), smooth and rich (tactile impressions), a
vibrant wine with personality to spare (holistic impression). What sounds
like some insufferable wine snob showing off is actually just some poor wine
lover trying his best to report the taste data the wine is sending him.
You’ve probably gotten many a laugh from wine descriptions you’ve read.
At face value, they sound preposterous: Unctuous, with butter and vanilla flavors
that coat the sides of your mouth. Supple and smooth, showing some fatness
in the mouth, and a long finish. (Wait! They forgot to say wet and “liquidy.”)
Imperfect medium that language is, however, it’s the only way we have of
communicating the taste of wine.
342
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
What the words are worth
Once, we engaged in a humbling yet fascinat-
ing exercise. Several wine writers were given a
wine to taste, along with eight published tasting
notes from other writers, only one of which cor-
responded to that wine. We were asked to iden-
tify that tasting note, as well as the note that
seemed the most inappropriate. The description
we all voted least appropriate for the wine
turned out to be the description taken from the
back label of the wine bottle! Not one of us had
correctly matched the description’s words to
our taste experience. Again, with another wine,
we each discovered that our taste and their
words failed to correspond. Our only possible
conclusions were either that we can’t taste very
well, writers can’t write very well (present com-
pany included), or that communicating taste is
a hopeless exercise.

Reading wine descriptions (or tasting notes, as they’re often called) in wine
newsletters or magazines can be as difficult as writing them. We must admit
that our eyes often glaze over when we try to read tasting notes. And we’re
not alone. Frank Prial, former wine columnist of The New York Times, once
wrote that “. . . a stranger’s tasting notes, to me anyway, are about as mean-
ingful as a Beijing bus schedule.”
When It’s Your Turn to Speak
Describing your experience or impression of a wine involves two steps: First,
you have to form the impression; second, you have to communicate it.
When you drink wine with friends purely for enjoyment and appreciation —
over dinner, for example — simple impressions and silly comments are 
perfectly appropriate. If a wine strikes you as unusually full and voluptuous,
why not say that it’s like Anna Nicole? If a wine seems tight and unyielding,
go ahead and call it Ebenezer Scrooge. Everyone will know exactly what
you mean.
In other circumstances, though, such as when you’re attending a wine-tasting
event, you probably want to form more considered impressions of each wine
so that you can participate in the discussion and gain the most from the event.
To form a considered impression, you need to taste thoughtfully.
Organizing your thoughts
The language you use to describe a wine starts with your own thoughts as
you taste the wine. Thus, the process of tasting a wine and the process of
describing it are intertwined.
Although wine tasting involves examining wine visually and smelling it as
well as tasting it, those first two steps are a breeze compared to the third.
When the wine is in your mouth, the multiple taste sensations — flavors, 
texture, body, sweetness or dryness, acidity, tannin, balance, length —
occur practically all at once. In order to make sense of the information you
receive from the wine, you have to impose some order on the impressions.
(Turn to Chapter 2 for information on the steps involved in examining,
smelling, and tasting wine.)
343
Chapter 18: Describing and Rating Wine

One way of organizing the impressions a wine sends you is to classify those
impressions according to the nature of the “taste”:
 The wine’s aromatics (the olfactory data, all the flavors you smell in your
mouth)
 The wine’s structure (its alcohol/sweetness/acid/tannin makeup and its
basic tastes — the wine’s bricks and mortar, so to speak)
 The wine’s texture (the tactile data, how the wine feels in your mouth;
texture is a function of the wine’s structural components — a high acid,
dry, low-alcohol white wine may feel thin or sharp, for example, whereas
a high-alcohol red wine with low tannin may feel soft and silky)
Another way of organizing the impressions a wine sends you is by the sequence
of your impressions, as we describe in Chapter 2. The words that tasters use
to describe the sequence are
 Attack: The first impression of the wine, which may involve sweetness,
dryness, richness or thinness of texture, or even fruitiness (although
most of the wine’s flavors register a few moments later).
 Evolution: The development of the wine in your mouth. You can think
of this stage in two parts: the mid-palate impression, a phase when you
tend to notice the wine’s acidity, get a first impression of its tannin
(in red wines) and notice its flavors and their intensity; and the rear-palate
impression, which involves the degree of persistence that the wine’s 
flavors have across the length of your mouth, the amount and nature
of the wine’s tannins, and any indication of a burning sensation from
overly high alcohol.
 Finish or aftertaste: Flavors or impressions that register after the wine
has been spat or swallowed. Both the duration of the aftertaste and its
nature are noteworthy. A long finish is commendable, for example, and 
a bitter one is not. A suggestion of concentrated fruit character on the
finish often indicates that a wine is age-worthy.
Writing tasting notes
Some people have a special ability to remember tastes. But other people
need to take notes in order to remember what they tasted, let alone what
they thought of it. If you have the slightest difficulty remembering the names
of wines, jot down the names of wines you try and like so that you can enjoy
them — or similar wines — again.
344
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

It’s a good idea to write comments about wines that you taste, too. Even if
you’re one of those lucky few who can remember everything you taste, we
recommend that you write tasting notes now and then because the exercise
of taking notes helps discipline your tasting methods.
When we take notes on wines, we automatically write the letters
 C (for color and appearance in general)
 N (for nose)
 T (for taste, or mouth impressions)
We put one below the other, under the name of each wine on our tasting
sheet, leaving space to record our impressions.
When we taste, we take each wine as it comes: If a wine is very aromatic, we
write lots of things next to N, but if the aroma is understated we can just
write subtle or even not much. When we taste the wine, we approach it
sequentially, noting its attack and evolution, and we hold the wine long
enough to note its balance and texture, too. Then (having spat), we often
taste the wine again to determine what else it may be saying. Sometimes at
that point we arrive at a summary description of the wine, like a huge wine
packed with fruitiness that’s ready to drink now, or a lean, austere wine that will
taste better with food than alone. Our tasting notes are a combination of frag-
mented observation — high acid, very crisp — and summary description.
345
Chapter 18: Describing and Rating Wine
To taste, perchance to drink
In wine circles, tasting and drinking are two dif-
ferent activities. Tasting involves thoughtful
evaluation of a wine’s quality, flavors, texture,
aging potential, and so on; if more than a couple
of wines are being tasted comparatively, usu-
ally tasters spit the wine out (as we mention in
Chapter 17) in order to keep their thinking clear.
Drinking, on the other hand, involves consumption
and sheer appreciation, without any particular
analysis of the wine other than the judgment that
you like it. (If you don’t like it, you don’t drink it.)
Unless you’re a professional in the wine business,
you don’t ever have to taste a wine seriously; you
can just drink it. However, many wine drinkers
have discovered that wine tasting can be a fun
way to learn more about wine.

At first, your own notes will be brief. Just a few words, like soft, fruity or
tannic, hard are fine to remind you later what the wine was like. And as an
evaluation of overall quality, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with yum!
Describing wine: Purism versus poetry
Some people have the idea that there’s a right way and a wrong way to
describe wine. Many enologists (people who have earned a degree in the 
science of winemaking), for example, usually favor a scientific approach
to describing wine. This approach relies on descriptors that are objective,
quantifiable, and reproducible — such as the level of acidity in a wine
(which is measurable) or specific aroma and flavor descriptors (reproducible
in laboratory tests). They dislike fanciful or unspecific terms, such as rich,
generous, or smooth.
Other people who aren’t scientists (ourselves included) believe that strictly
scientific descriptions usually fail to communicate the spirit of a wine. We’re
all for noting the relative acidity, tannin, and alcohol levels of a wine, but we
won’t stop there; we like to describe the overall personality of a wine, even
if we have to use language that’s more personal than universal.
Sometimes, if a wine is really a great wine, tasters stumble into the most con-
troversial realm of wine description: poetry. We never try to come up with
picturesque metaphorical descriptions for wines, but sometimes a wine just
puts the words in our mouths. One memorable wine in our early days of tast-
ing was a 1970 Brunello di Montalcino that we described as a rainbow in the
mouth, its flavors so perfectly blended that each one is barely perceptible
individually. Recently a friend of ours described a glass of great but young
Vintage Port as “like rubbing a cat in the wrong direction.”
If a wine inspires you to such fanciful description, by all means go with it;
only a cold-blooded scientist would resist. The experience of that wine will
become memorable through the personal words you use to name it.
But beware of anyone who is moved to poetry over every wine. The vast
majority of wines are prosaic, and their descriptions should be, too.
And when you do lapse into metaphor over a wine, don’t necessarily expect
others to understand what you mean or even to approve. Literal types will be
all over you, demanding to know what a rainbow tastes like and how a wine
can possibly resemble a cat.
346
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 

In the end, the experience of wine is so personal that the best any of us can
do is to try to describe the experience to others. Your descriptions will be
meaningful to people who share your approach and your language, especially
if they’re tasting the wine along with you. But someone else picking up your
notes will find them incomprehensible. Likewise, you’ll find some wine
descriptions you read incomprehensible. Such is the nature of the exercise.
Rating Wine Quality
When a wine critic writes a tasting note, he usually accompanies it with a
point score, a judgment of the wine’s quality on a scale of 20 or 100. You see
these numbers plastered all over the shelves in your wine shop and in wine
advertisements.
Because words are such a difficult medium for describing wine, the popularity
of number ratings has spread like wildfire. Many wine lovers don’t bother to
read the descriptions in a critic’s wine reviews — they just run out to buy the
wines with the highest scores. (Hey, they’re the best wines, right?) Wines that
receive high scores from the best-known critics sell out almost overnight as
the result of the demand generated by their scores.
Numbers do provide a convenient shorthand for communicating a critic’s
opinion of a wine’s quality. But number ratings are problematic, too, for a
number of reasons:
 The sheer precision of the scores suggests that they’re objective, when
in fact they represent either the subjective opinion of an individual critic
or the combined subjective opinions of a panel of critics.
 Different critics can apply the same scale differently. For example, some
may assign 95 points only to wines that are truly great compared to all
wines of all types, while others could assign the same score to a wine
that is great in its own class.
 The score probably reflects an evaluation of a wine in different circum-
stances than you will taste it. Most critics rate wines by tasting them
without food, for example, while most wine drinkers drink wine with
food. Also, the wine glass the critic uses can be different from what you
use, and even this detail can affect the way the wine presents itself.
 Number scores tell you absolutely nothing about how the wine tastes.
347
Chapter 18: Describing and Rating Wine

This last point, for us, is the most important. You may hate a wine that’s rated
highly — and not only that, but you may end up feeling like a hopeless fool
who can’t recognize quality when it’s staring him in the face. Save your money
and your pride by deciding what kinds of wine you like and then trying to
figure out from the words whether a particular wine is your style — regardless
of the number rating. This advice is the principle behind our book WineStyle
(Wiley); we urge you to read it, so that you can articulate what you like.
Despite the pitfalls of number ratings, you may be inclined to score wines
yourself when you taste — and we encourage you to do that. Numbers can
be very meaningful to the person assigning them.
To start, decide which scale you’ll use. We suggest a scale with 100 as
the highest score, because it is more intuitive than a scale ending in 20.
(Most 100-point scales are actually only 50-point scales, with 50 points,
not zero, representing the poorest conceivable quality.)
After deciding your scale, create several groupings of points, and write down
the quality level that each group represents. It can be something like this:
 95–100: Absolutely outstanding; one of the finest wines ever
 90–94: Exceptional quality; excellent wine
 85–89: Very good quality
 80–84: Above-average quality; good
 75–79: Average commercial quality (a “C” student)
 70–74: Below average quality
 Below 70: Poor quality
Until you get the hang of using this system, you may just want to give each wine
a range rather than a precise score, such as 80–84 (good) or 85–89 (very good).
As you gain experience in tasting wine and rating wine quality, you become
more opinionated and your scores will naturally become more precise.
Just remember that like every other critic, you have your own taste prefer-
ences that inevitably influence your scores, no matter how objective you try
to be. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that all your wine friends should
agree with you.

Marrying Wine with Food
In This Chapter
 Predictable reactions between wines and foods
 Guiding principles for matchmakers
 Classic combos that still work
E
very now and then, we encounter a wine that stops us dead in our
tracks. It’s so sensational that we lose all interest in anything but that
wine. We drink it with intent appreciation, trying to memorize the taste.
We wouldn’t dream of diluting its perfection with a mouthful of food.
But 999 times out of 1,000, we drink our wine with food. Wine is meant to go
with food. And good food is meant to go with wine.
Good. We’ve settled that. Wine goes with food, and food goes with wine.
Any questions?
Of course we’re being facetious. There are thousands of wines in the world,
and every one is different. And there are thousands of basic foods in the
world, each different — not to mention the infinite combinations of foods in
prepared dishes (what we really eat). In reality, food-with-wine is about as
simple an issue as boy-meets-girl.
The Dynamics of Food and Wine
Every dish is dynamic — it’s made up of several ingredients and flavors that
interact to create a (more or less) delicious whole. Every wine is dynamic in
exactly the same way. When food and wine combine in your mouth, the dynam-
ics of each change; the result is completely individual to each dish-and-wine
combination. (Dare we also mention that we each use our individual palates
to judge the success of each combination? No wonder there are no rules!)

When wine meets food, several things can happen:
 The food can exaggerate a characteristic of the wine. For example, if you
eat walnuts (which are tannic) with a tannic red wine, such as a Bordeaux,
the wine tastes so dry and astringent that most people would consider it
undrinkable.
 The food can diminish a characteristic of the wine. Protein diminishes
the impression of tannin, for example, and an overly-tannic red wine —
unpleasant on its own — could be delightful with rare steak or roast beef.
 The flavor intensity of the food can obliterate the wine’s flavor or vice
versa. If you’ve ever drunk a big, rich red wine with a delicate filet of
sole, you’ve had this experience firsthand.
 The wine can contribute new flavors to the dish. For example, a red
Zinfandel that’s gushing with berry fruit can bring its berry flavors to
the dish, as if another ingredient had been added.
 The combination of wine and food can create an unwelcome third-party
flavor that wasn’t in either the wine or the food originally; we get a
metallic flavor when we eat plain white-meat turkey with red Bordeaux.
 The food and wine can interact perfectly, creating a sensational taste
experience that is greater than the food or the wine alone. (This scenario
is what we hope will happen every time we eat and drink, but it’s as rare
as a show-stopping dish.)
Fortunately, what happens between food and wine is not haphazard. Certain
elements of food react in predictable ways with certain elements of wine, giving
us a fighting chance at making successful matches. The major components of
wine (alcohol, sweetness, acid, and tannin) relate to the basic tastes of food
(sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and saltiness) the same way that the princi-
ple of balance in wine operates: Some of the elements exaggerate each other,
and some of them compensate for each other. (See the discussion of balance
in Chapter 2.)
350
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
The fifth wheel
Common wisdom was that humans can perceive
four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. But
people who study food have concluded that a fifth
taste exists, and there may be many more than
that. The fifth taste is called umami (pronounced
oo MAH me), and it’s associated with a savory
character in foods. Shellfish, oily fish, meats, and
cheeses are some foods high in umami taste.
Umami-rich foods can increase the sensation of
bitterness in wines served with them. To coun-
teract this effect, try adding something salty
(such as salt itself) or sour (such as vinegar) to
your dish. Although this suggestion defies the
adage that vinegar and wine don’t get along, the
results are the proof of the pudding.

Here are some ways that food and wine interact, based on the components of
the wine. Remember, each wine and each dish has more than one component,
and the simple relationships we describe can be complicated by other elements
in the wine or the food. Whether a wine is considered tannic, sweet, acidic, or
high in alcohol depends on its dominant component. (See “Describing Taste”
in Chapter 2.)
Tannic wines
Tannic wines include most wines based on the Cabernet Sauvignon grape
(including red Bordeaux), northern Rhône reds, Barolo and Barbaresco, and
any wine — white or red — that has become tannic from aging in new oak
barrels. These wines can
 Diminish the perception of sweetness in a food
 Taste softer and less tannic when served with protein-rich, fatty foods,
such as steak or cheese
 Taste less bitter when paired with salty foods
 Taste astringent, or mouth-drying, when drunk with spicy-hot foods
Sweet wines
Some wines that often have some sweetness include most inexpensive California
white wines, White Zinfandel, many Rieslings (unless they’re labeled “dry” or
“trocken”), and medium-dry Vouvray. Sweet wines also include dessert wines
such as Port, sweetened Sherries, and late-harvest wines. These wines can
 Taste less sweet, but fruitier, when matched with salty foods
 Make salty foods more appealing
 Go well with sweet foods
Acidic wines
Acidic wines include most Italian white wines; Sancerre, Pouilly-Fumé, and
Chablis; traditionally-made red wines from Rioja; most dry Rieslings; and
wines based on Sauvignon Blanc that are fully dry. These wines can
 Taste less acidic when served with salty foods
 Taste less acidic when served with slightly sweet foods
 Make foods taste slightly saltier
 Counterbalance oily or fatty heaviness in food
351
Chapter 19: Marrying Wine with Food

High-alcohol wines
High alcohol wines include many California wines, both white and red; southern
Rhône whites and reds; Barolo and Barbaresco; fortified wines such as Port
and Sherry; and most wines produced from grapes grown in warm climates.
These wines can
 Overwhelm lightly flavored or delicate dishes
 Go well with slightly sweet foods
Birds of a Feather, or Opposites Attract?
Two principles can help in matching wine with food: the complementary 
principle and the contrast principle. The complementary principle involves
choosing a wine that is similar in some way to the dish you plan to serve,
while the contrast principle (not surprisingly) involves combining foods
with wines that are dissimilar to them in some way.
The characteristics of a wine that can either resemble or contrast with the
characteristics of a dish are
 The wine’s flavors: Earthy, herbal, fruity, vegetal, and so on
 The intensity of flavor in the wine: Weak flavor intensity, moderately
flavorful, or very flavorful
 The wine’s texture: Crisp and firm, or soft and supple
 The weight of the wine: Light-bodied, medium-bodied, or full-bodied
352
Part VI: When You’ve Caught the Bug 
“A châque son gout” — personal taste rules
We once happened to discuss food pairings for
red Bordeaux wine with the owner of one of the
five first growths of Bordeaux (see Chapter 9 
for an explanation of first growths). “I don’t
like Bordeaux with lamb,” the distinguished
gentleman proclaimed. We were confused; “But
Bordeaux and lamb is a classic combination!”
we said. “No, I don’t agree,” he answered, hold-
ing his ground. After a moment, he added, “Of
course, I don’t like lamb.”

You probably use the complementary principle often without realizing it: You
choose a light-bodied wine to go with a light dish, a medium-bodied wine to go
with a fuller dish, and a full-bodied wine to go with a heavy dish. Some other
examples of the complementary principle in action are
 Dishes with flavors that resemble those in the wine. Think about the
flavors in a dish the same way you think about the flavors in wine — as
families of flavors. If a dish has mushrooms, it has an earthy flavor; if it
has citrus or other elements of fruit, it has a fruity flavor (and so on).
Then consider which wines would offer their own earthy flavor, fruity
flavor, herbal flavor, spicy flavor, or whatever. The earthy flavors of
white Burgundy complement risotto with mushrooms, for example, and
an herbal Sancerre complements chicken breast with fresh herbs.
 Foods with texture that’s similar to that of the wine. A California
Chardonnay with a creamy, rich texture could match the rich, soft 
texture of lobster, for example.
 Foods and wines whose intensity of flavor match. A very flavorful
Asian stir-fry or Tex-Mex dish would be at home with a very flavorful,
rather than a subtle, wine.
The contrast principle seeks to find flavors or texture in a wine that aren’t in
a dish but that would enhance it. A dish of fish or chicken in a rich cream and
butter sauce, for example, may be matched with a dry Vouvray, a white wine
whose crispness (thanks to its uplifting, high acidity) would counterbalance
the heaviness of the dish. A dish with earthy flavors such as portobello mush-
rooms and fresh fava beans (or potatoes and black truffles) may contrast
nicely with the pure fruit flavor of an Alsace Riesling.
You also apply the contrast principle every time you decide to serve simple
food, like unadorned lamb chops or hard cheese and bread, with a gloriously
complex aged wine.
In order to apply either principle, of course, you have to have a good idea
of what the food is going to taste like and what various wines taste like.
That second part can be a real stumbling block for people who don’t devote
every ounce of their free energy to learning about wine. The solution is to ask
your wine merchant. A retailer may not have the world’s greatest knack in
wine and food pairings (then again, he or she might), but at least he should
know what his wines taste like.

Chapter 19: Marrying Wine with Food

The Wisdom of the Ages
No matter how much you value imagination and creativity, there’s no sense
reinventing the wheel. In wine-and-food terms, it pays to know the classic
pairings because they work, and they’re a sure thing.
Here are some famous and reliable combinations:
 Oysters and traditional, unoaked Chablis
 Lamb and red Bordeaux (we like Chianti with lamb, too)
 Port with walnuts and Stilton cheese
 Salmon with Pinot Noir
 Amarone with Gorgonzola cheese
 Grilled fish with Vinho Verde
 Foie gras with Sauternes or with late-harvest Gewürztraminer
 Braised beef with Barolo
 Dry amontillado Sherry with soup
 Grilled chicken with Beaujolais
 Toasted almonds or green olives with fino or manzanilla Sherry
 Goat cheese with Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé
 Dark chocolate with California Cabernet Sauvignon

throughout Chapters 9 through 15 of this book.

Answers to Ten Common
Questions about Wine
I
n our years of teaching about wine and helping customers in wine shops,
we’ve noticed that the same questions about wine pop up again and again.
Here are our answers.
What’s the best wine?
This is probably the question customers ask most frequently in wine shops.
The retailer usually responds with a barrage of questions, such as
 “Do you prefer red wines or white wines?”
 “How much do you want to spend for a bottle?”
 “Are you planning to serve the wine with any particular dish?”
As all these questions suggest, the “best wine” depends on your taste and cir-
cumstances. There’s no single “best wine” for everyone.
Hundreds of very good wines can be found in most wine shops. Thirty years
ago, there were far fewer — but winemaking and grapegrowing know-how has
progressed dramatically, to the point that there are now few poor wines.
You won’t necessarily like every one of those good wines, however. There’s
simply no getting around the fact that taste is personal. If you want to drink a
good wine that’s right for you, you have to decide what the characteristics of
that wine could be. And then get advice from a knowledgeable retailer.

When should I drink this wine?
Wine retailers frequently hear this question from customers, too. The answer,
for most wines, is “Any time now.”
The great majority of wines are ready to drink when you buy them. Some of
them may improve marginally if you hold them for a year or so (and many of
them will maintain their drinkability), but they won’t improve enough for you
to notice, unless you’re a particularly thoughtful and experienced taster.
Some fine wines are an exception: They not only benefit from aging but also
they need to age, in order to achieve their potential quality. For example,
assuming that the wines are well stored (turn to Chapter 16 for specifics of
wine storage):
 You can usually count on 20 to 30 years (or more) of life from top-quality
red Bordeaux wines in good years such as 1982, 1986, 1989, 1990, 1995,
1996, 2000, or the upcoming 2005 (available in late 2007 and 2008). Note:
many 1982s are ready to drink now.
 The best Barolos, Barbarescos, and Brunello di Montalcinos can age for
20 to 30 years in good vintages.
 The best white Burgundies and white Bordeaux improve with 10 to 15
years of aging or more, in good vintage years.
 Most of today’s red Burgundies, with the possible exception of the 1996
and 2002 vintages, should be consumed within 10 to 15 years (the less
expensive ones even earlier).
For a listing of good vintage years and the approximate stage of readiness of
the wines from those years, refer to Appendix C. For the names of some spe-
cific producers in each category whose wines we recommend, refer to
Chapters 9 and 10.
Is wine fattening?
A glass of dry wine contains 80 to 85 percent water, 12 to 14 percent ethyl
alcohol, and small quantities of tartaric acid and various other components.
Wine contains no fat.
A 4-ounce serving of dry white wine has about 104 calories, and 4 ounces of
red wine has about 110 calories. Sweeter wines contain about 10 percent
more calories depending on how sweet they are; fortified wines also contain
additional calories because of their higher alcohol.
358
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

What grape variety made this wine?
Most New World wines (from the Americas, Australia, and other continents
besides Europe) tell you what grape variety they’re made from right on the
front label — it’s often the very name of the wine — or on the back label.
Traditional European wines blended from several grape varieties usually don’t
give you that information a) because the winemakers consider the name of the
place more important than the grapes, anyway, and b) because often the
grapes they use are local varieties whose names few people would recognize.
If you really want to know what grape varieties make a Soave, Valpolicella,
Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rioja, Côtes du Rhône, or other blended European
wines, you’ll generally have to look it up. (See our charts in Chapters 9, 10,
and 11.)
Which vintage should I buy?
This question assumes that you have a choice among several vintages of the
same wine. Most of the time, however, you don’t. Nearly every wine is avail-
able in only one vintage, which is referred to as the current vintage.
For white wines, the current vintage represents grapes that were harvested
as recently as nine months ago or as long as three years ago, depending on
the type of wine; for red wines, the current vintage is a date one to four 
years ago.
Classified-growth red Bordeaux wines (see Chapter 9) are a notable excep-
tion: Most wine shops feature several vintages of these wines. A few other
fine wines — such as Burgundies, Barolos, or Rhône wines — may also be
available in multiple vintages, but often they’re not because the quantities
produced are small and the wines sell out.
A red Rioja or a Chianti Classico may appear to be available in multiple vin-
tages, but if you read the label carefully, you see that one vintage of the Rioja
could be a crianza (aged two years before release), another may be a reserva
(aged three years), and another may be a gran reserva (aged five years) — so
they are each actually different wines, not multiple vintages of the same wine.
Likewise, a Chianti may be available in an aged riserva version as well as a
non-riserva style.
Most of the time, for most wines, the vintage to buy is the vintage you can
buy — the current vintage. For the exceptional cases, consult our vintage
chart in Appendix C.

Chapter 20: Answers to Ten Common Questions about Wine

Are there any wines without sulfites?
Sulfur dioxide exists naturally in wine as a result of fermentation. It also
exists naturally in other fermented foods, such as bread, cookies, and beer.
(Various sulfur derivatives are also used regularly as preservatives in pack-
aged foods.)
Winemakers use sulfur dioxide at various stages of the winemaking process
because it stabilizes the wine (preventing it from turning to vinegar or deteri-
orating from oxygen exposure) and safeguards its flavor. Sulfur has been an
important winemaking tool since Roman times.
Very few winemakers refrain from using sulfur dioxide, but some do. Your
wine shop may carry a few wines whose sulfite content is so low that their
labels do not have to carry the phrase Contains Sulfites (which the U.S. gov-
ernment requires on the label of any wine that contains more than 10 parts
per million of sulfites).
If you wish to limit your consumption of sulfites, dry red wines should be
your first choice, followed by dry white wines. Sweet wines contain the most
sulfur dioxide. For more info, turn to Chapter 1.
What are organic wines?
The new standards of organic agriculture established by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture in 2002 contain two categories for wine:
 Wine made from organically grown grapes; these are wines whose grapes
come from certified organic vineyards.
 Organic wine; these wines come from organically grown grapes and are
also produced organically, that is, without the addition of chemical addi-
tives such as sulfur dioxide during winemaking.
These categories apply to imported wines sold in the United States as well as
to domestic wines. Many more brands, by far, fall into the first category than
the second, because most winemakers do use sulfur dioxide in making their
wines. (See the previous section for the reasons.)
But not all wines from organically grown grapes are labeled as such. Some
winemakers who are deeply committed to organic farming prefer to promote
and sell their wines based on the wines’ quality, not the incidental feature of
360
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

their organic farming. For them, organic farming is a means to an end — better
grapes, and therefore better wine — rather than a marketing tool. Also, the
fact that a national definition of organic did not exist in the past disinclined
some wineries from using that word.
Now that formal categories exist, many more producers who farm organically
will perhaps begin using the “O” word on their labels. But the number of
wines in the more rigid Organic wine category will probably remain small,
because of the sulfur dioxide restriction.
What is a wine expert?
A wine expert is someone with a high level of knowledge about wine in gen-
eral, including grape growing, winemaking, and the various wines of the
world. A wine expert also has a high degree of skill in tasting wine.
Until fairly recently, most wine experts in the United States gained their exper-
tise through informal study, work experience, or experience gained as amateurs
(lovers) of wine. Although accredited wine courses did exist, they were uni-
versity programs in enology (winemaking) and viticulture (grapegrowing) —
valuable for people who plan to become winemakers or grape growers, but 
scientific overkill for people whose goal is breadth of knowledge about wine.
Today, many people become wine experts through the programs of the Wine &
Spirit Education Trust (or WSET®; www.wset.co.uk), or various professional
sommelier organizations, which include examinations at the end of study.
Some examinations entitle successful students to use initials after their
names, such as CWE (Certified Wine Educator), MS (Master Sommelier) or
MW (Master of Wine). MW is the oldest and most difficult credential for wine
experts to earn.
How do I know when to drink the special
older wines I’ve been keeping?
Unfortunately, no precise answer to this question exists because all wines
age at a different pace. Even two bottles of the same wine that are stored
under the same conditions can age differently.
When you have a specific wine in mind, you can get advice in several differ-
ent ways:
361
Chapter 20: Answers to Ten Common Questions about Wine

 Consult the comments of critics like Robert Parker, Michael Broadbent,
or Steve Tanzer, who almost always list a suggested drinking period for
wines they review in their newsletters and books (listed in Chapter 17);
their educated guesses are usually quite reliable.
 Contact the winery; in the case of fine, older vintages, the winemaker
and his staff are usually happy to give you their opinion on the best time
to drink their wine — and they typically have more experience with the
wine than anyone else.
 If you have several bottles of the same wine, try one from time to time 
to see how the wine is developing. Your own taste is really the best
guide — you may enjoy the wine younger, or older, than the experts.
Do old wines require special handling?
Like humans, wine can become somewhat fragile in its later years. For one
thing, it doesn’t like to travel. If you must move old wine, give it several days’
rest afterwards, before opening the bottle. (Red Burgundies and other Pinot
Noirs are especially disturbed by journeys.)
Older wines, with their delicate bouquet and flavors, can easily be over-
whelmed by strongly flavored foods. Simple cuts of meat or just hard cheeses
and good, crusty bread are usually fine companions for mature wines.
If you’re going to drink an older wine, don’t over-chill it (whether it’s white or
red). Older wines show their best at moderate temperatures. Temperatures
below 60°F (15.5°C) inhibit development in the glass.
Decant red wines or Vintage Ports to separate the clear wine from any sedi-
ment that formed in the bottle. (For tips on decanting, see Chapter 8.) Stand
the bottle up two or three days before you plan to open it so that the sedi-
ment can drift to the bottom. An important concern in decanting an old wine
is giving the wine too much aeration: A wine in its last stages will deteriorate
rapidly upon exposure to air, often within a half hour — sometimes in 10 or
15 minutes.
When you decant an old wine, taste it immediately and be prepared to drink
it rapidly if it shows signs of fading.

Chapter 21
Ten Wine Myths Demystified
A
s you leaf through the pages of this chapter, you’ll probably recognize
several of the myths we mention. They all represent common thinking —
and common misinformation — about wine. We set the record straight.
The best wines are varietal wines
Many people applaud varietal wines — wines that are named after a grape
variety, such as Chardonnay or Merlot — because when you buy a varietal
wine, you supposedly know what you’re getting. (Actually, for most American
wines, only 75 percent of the wine has to come from the named variety, and
for most other wines, only 85 percent — so you don’t know exactly what
you’re getting.) But the presence of a grape variety name on the label, even a
top-quality variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, tells you nothing about the
quality of the wine.
Varietal wines range in quality from ordinary to excellent. Wines named in
other ways (for their region of production or with a fantasy name) also range
in quality from ordinary to excellent. Varietal wines in general are no better
and no worse than other wines.
Wine has to be expensive to be good
For wine, as for many other products, a high price often indicates high qual-
ity. But the highest quality wine isn’t always the best choice, for the following
reasons:
 Your taste is personal, and you may not like a wine that critics consider
very high in quality.
 Not all situations call for a very high quality wine.
We certainly can enjoy even an $8 wine in many circumstances. At large
family gatherings, on picnics, at the beach, and so on, an expensive, top-
quality wine can be out-of-place — too serious and important.

Likewise, the very finest wines are seldom the best choices in restaurants —
considering typical restaurant prices. Instead, we look for the best value on
the wine list (keeping in mind what we are eating) or experiment with some
moderately priced wine that we haven’t tried before. (There will always be
some wines that you haven’t tried.)
Quality isn’t the only consideration in choosing a wine. Often, the best wine
of all for your taste or for a certain situation will be inexpensive.
Dark-colored reds are the best red wines
Many red wines today are extremely deep in color, almost to the point of
being black rather than red. An opaque appearance in a red wine suggests
that the wine’s aromas and flavors are as concentrated as its color is, and for
that reason, some people have begun to equate deep color with high quality.
While it’s true that some very great red wines have deep color, other great
red wines do not. Wines made from lightly pigmented grape varieties such as
Pinot Noir, Nebbiolo and Sangiovese, for example, will never be naturally
opaque in color, and yet they can certainly be great. (And if winemakers
strive to get the grapes super-ripe, which can deepen the wine’s color, the
wine is likely to be dark at the expense of finesse in its flavors.)
Winemakers today have ways of artificially deepening the color of red wines,
and therefore even cheap, everyday wines can be deep in color if the wine-
maker wants to make them that way. Don’t be fooled into thinking that dark
equals high quality.
The tendency to make red wines as dark in color as possible often backfires:
the resulting wine may be over-ripe, overly tannic, too high in extract, and/or
too high in alcohol. Regard very-dark colored wines as a warning signal: You
may love some of them, but on the other hand, you may find others to be
overdone or over-manipulated.
White wine with fish, red with meat
As guidelines go, this isn’t a bad one. But we said guideline, not rule. Anyone
who slavishly adheres to this generalization deserves the boredom of eating
and drinking exactly the same thing every day of his life! Do you want a glass
of white wine with your burger? Go ahead, order it. You’re the one who’s
doing the eating and drinking, not your friend and not the server who’s taking
your order.
364
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Even if you’re a perfectionist who’s always looking for the ideal food and 
wine combination, you’ll find yourself wandering from the guideline. The 
best wine for a grilled salmon steak is probably red — like a Pinot Noir or a
Bardolino — and not white at all. Veal and pork do equally well with red or
white wines, depending on how the dish is prepared. And what can be better
with hot dogs on the grill than a cold glass of rosé?
No one is going to arrest you if you have white wine with everything, or red
wine with everything, or even Champagne with everything! There are no
rules. (We offer a few additional suggestions for possible wine-food pairings
in Chapter 19.)
Numbers don’t lie
It’s natural to turn to critics for advice. We do it all the time, when we’re trying
to decide which movie to see, when we’re choosing a new restaurant to try, or
when we want to know what someone else thinks of a particular book.
In most cases, we weigh the critics’ opinions against our own experience and
tastes. Say a steak house just got three stars and a fabulous review from the
dining critic. Do we rush to the telephone to make a reservation? Not if we
don’t like red meat! When the movie critics give two thumbs up, do we auto-
matically assume that we’ll like the movie — or do we listen to their commen-
tary and decide whether the movie may be too violent, silly, or serious for
us? You know the answer to that.
Yet many wine drinkers, when they hear that a wine just got more than 90
points, go out of their way to get that wine. The curiosity to try a wine that
scores well is understandable. But the rigid belief that such a wine a) is nec-
essarily a great wine, and b) is a wine you will like, is simply misguided.
The critics’ scores are nothing more than the critics’ professional opinion —
and opinion, like taste, is always personal. (Chapter 18 tells you more about
scoring wine.)
Vintages always matter/
vintages don’t matter
The difference between one vintage and the next of the same wine is the 
difference between the weather in the vineyards from one year to the next
365
Chapter 21: Ten Wine Myths Demystified

(barring extenuating circumstances such as replanting of the vineyard, new
ownership of the winery, or the hiring of a new winemaker). The degree of
vintage variation is thus equivalent to the degree of weather variation.
In some parts of the world the weather varies a lot from year to year, and for
wines from those regions, vintages certainly do matter. In Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Germany, and most of Italy, for example, weather problems (frost, hail, ill-
timed rain, or insufficient heat) can affect one vintage for the worse, while
the next year may have no such problems. Where a lot of weather variation
exists, the quality of the wine can swing from mediocre to outstanding from
one year to the next.
In places where the weather is more predictable year after year (like much of
California, Australia, and South Africa), vintages can still vary, but the swing
is narrower. Serious wine lovers who care about the intimate details of the
wines they drink will find the differences meaningful, but most people won’t.
Another exception to the “Vintages always matter” myth is inexpensive wine.
Top-selling wines that are produced in large volume are usually blended from
many vineyards in a fairly large area. Swings in quality from year to year are
not significant.
Wine authorities are experts
Wine is an incredibly vast subject. It involves biochemistry, botany, geology,
chemistry, climatology, history, culture, politics, laws, and business. How can
anyone be an expert in all that? To compound the problem, some people in
authoritative positions within the wine field may have had little, if any, educa-
tion, training, or background in wine before being given jobs by wine companies
or columns by publishers, and “ordained” wine authorities almost overnight.
Also, different aspects of wine appeal to different people. Depending on what
they particularly like about wine, people tend to specialize in some of wine’s
disciplines at the expense of others. (Now you know why it takes two of us to
write this book.)
Don’t expect any one person to be able to answer all your questions about
wine in the most accurate and up-to-date manner. Just like doctors and
lawyers, wine professionals specialize. They have to.
366
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Old wines are good wines
The idea of rare old bottles of wine being auctioned off for tens of thousands
of dollars apiece, like fine art, is fascinating enough to capture anyone’s imag-
ination. But valuable old bottles of wine are even rarer than valuable old
coins because, unlike coins, wine is perishable.
The great majority of the world’s wines don’t have what it takes to age for
decades. Most wines are meant to be enjoyed in the first one to five years of
their lives. Even those wines that have the potential to develop slowly over
many years will achieve their potential only if they are properly stored. (See
Chapter 16 for information on storing wines.)
The purpose of wine is to be enjoyed — usually, sooner rather than later.
Great wines are supposed to taste 
bad when they’re young
If this myth were true, wouldn’t that be convenient for anyone who made
poor wine! “It’s a great wine,” the winery owner could argue. “It’s supposed to
taste bad when it’s young.”
In the past, some of the great wines of the world, like red Bordeaux, were 
so tough and tannic that you really couldn’t drink them until they had a few
decades under their belts. As recently as the 1975 vintage of Bordeaux, some
collectors believed that the undrinkability of the young wines was proof posi-
tive of their age-worthiness.
Winemakers today believe that a great wine must be in balance when it’s
young in order to be a balanced wine when it’s old. (Refer to Chapter 2 for 
a discussion of balance.) Although the tannins in old wines usually soften
and/or drop out in the form of sediment, most wines today that are extraordi-
narily tannic when young don’t have enough fruit character to last until their
tannins fade.
A wine can be in balance without being ready to drink. A great wine can have
enormous tannin when it’s young, along with its enormous fruit. It may be
balanced, even if it’s still embryonic. You may be able to appreciate the wine’s
balance when it’s young; you may even enjoy the wine to some degree; but its
true greatness is years away, thanks to the wine’s ability to develop flavor
complexity and greater harmony of its components with age.
367
Chapter 21: Ten Wine Myths Demystified

Champagnes don’t age
We don’t know who started this myth; to the contrary, Champagne does age
well! Depending on the particular year, Vintage Champagne can age especially
well. We have enjoyed two outstanding 1928 Vintage Champagnes, Krug 
and Moët & Chandon’s Dom Pérignon, neither of which showed any sign of
decline. The oldest Champagne that we’ve ever tasted, a 1900 Pol Roger, was
also in fine shape.
But Champagne demands excellent storage. If kept in a cool, dark, humid
place, many Champagnes can age for decades, especially in the great vin-
tages. They lose some effervescence but take on a complexity of flavor some-
what similar to fine white Burgundy. Champagnes in magnum bottles (1.5 l)
generally age better than those in regular size (750 ml) bottles.
If you want to try some very fine, reliable, older bottles of Vintage Champagne,
look for either Krug or Salon in the 1964, 1969, 1973, or 1976 vintage. If stored
well, they will be magnificent. Dom Pérignon is also reliable — the 1961 and
1969 DPs are legendary.
The following houses produce Champagnes known to age well:
 Krug: All their Champagnes are remarkably long-lived.
 Pol Roger: Especially Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill.
 Moët & Chandon: Cuvée Dom Pérignon, ageless when well stored.
 Louis Roederer: Cristal, Cristal Rosé, and Vintage Brut all age well.
 Jacquesson: Signature and Vintage Blanc de Blancs.
 Bollinger: All their Champagnes, especially the Grande Année.
 Gosset: Grand Millésime and Celebris.
 Salon: Remarkable Blanc de Blancs; needs at least 15 years of aging.
 Veuve Clicquot: La Grande Dame and the Vintage Brut.
 Taittinger: Their Blanc de Blancs (Comtes de Champagne).
 Billecart-Salmon: The Blanc de Blancs.
 Pommery: Cuvée Louise.
 Laurent-Perrier: Cuvée Grand Siècle.
 Philipponnat: Clos des Goisses.
Recent great vintages for Champagne are 1996, 1990, 1988, 1985, and 1982.

Appendix B
Glossary of Wine Terms
H
ere, for handy reference, are definitions of dozens of the most common
wine terms and wine-tasting terms.
acidity: A component of wine, generally
consisting of tartaric acid (a natural acid
in grapes) and comprising approximately
0.5 to 0.7 percent of the wine by volume.
aerate: To expose wine to air in prepara-
tion for drinking it, usually with the inten-
tion of allowing the most attractive aromas
to reveal themselves in an older wine, or
softening the harshness of a younger wine.
alcohol level: The percentage of alcohol
by volume that a wine has; most white
wines have an alcohol level between 9 and
14 percent, and most red wines have an
alcohol level between 12 and 14 percent.
American oak: Oak wood from a U.S.
forest, of the species quercus alba, and the
barrels made from such wood; some wine-
makers in certain wine regions (such as
Spain and Australia) favor American oak
for aging their wines.
ample: A descriptor for wines that give the
impression of being full and expansive in
your mouth.
AOC: Abbreviation for Appellation
d’Origine Contrôlée, sometimes shortened
to Appellation Contrôlée and abbreviated
as AC; translates to protected place
name; France’s official category for its
highest-ranking types of wine, whose
name, origin, grape varieties, and other
defining factors are regulated by law.
appellation: Name; often used to mean the
official geographic origin of a wine, which
is part of a wine’s official name.
aroma: The smell of a wine. Some purists
use the term aroma only for the straight-
forward, youthful smells of a wine, and use
the term bouquet for the more complex
smells of an aged wine. But we use aroma
as a general term for all wine smells.
aromatic: A descriptor for a wine that has
a pronounced smell, used particularly in
reference to fruity and floral smells. Some
white grape varieties are also dubbed aro-
matic because they are strong in aroma
compounds.
aromatic compounds: Those substances
in wine — derived from the grapes, from
winemaking, or from aging — that are
responsible for a wine’s aromas and 
flavors.
astringent: A descriptor for the mouth-
puckering, pore-tightening tactile charac-
ter of some wines, caused by tannin, acid,
or the combination of both. Generally not a
positive trait.

attack: The first impression a wine gives
you when you taste it. A wine’s attack is
related to sensations in the front of your
mouth.
balance: The interrelationship of a wine’s
alcohol, residual sugar, acid, and tannin;
when no one component stands out obtru-
sively in your mouth, a wine is said to be
well-balanced; wines can also have balance
between their aromas/flavors and their
structure.
barrel: A relatively small wooden container
for fermenting and/or aging wine, generally
60 gallons in size and generally made of oak.
barrel-aged: A term that applies to wines
that are fermented in containers of inert
material, such as stainless steel, and sub-
sequently placed into wooden barrels for a
period of maturation; the term also applies
to the maturation period of wines that also
fermented in the barrel.
barrel-fermented: A term that applies to
white wines that are fermented in oak bar-
rels; the oaky character of such wines is
generally more subtle than that of wines
that have been merely barrel-aged.
big: A general descriptor for wines that are
either very full or very intense.
black fruits: A general term for wine
aromas and flavors that suggest blackber-
ries, blueberries, black cherries, blackcur-
rants, or other black fruits.
black grapes: Wine grapes that have a red-
dish or blue pigmentation in their skins;
used to make red wine.
blend: To mix together two or more indi-
vidual lots of wine, usually wines from dif-
ferent grape varieties (but also applies to
wines from different vineyards, different
regions, or different vintages); a wine
derived from the juice of different grape
varieties is called a blend.
bodega: A winery in Spain; also the
Spanish word for a building where wine is
stored.
body: The impression of a wine’s weight in
your mouth. A wine’s body is generally
described as light, medium, or full.
bottle-age: Maturation of a wine after it has
been bottled; most wines undergo a short
period of bottle-age at the winery before
release; fine wines can require additional
bottle-age from the consumer.
bouquet: Evolved, mature aromas.
bright: Indicates a wine whose characteris-
tics are perceived as vivid by the senses.
A wine can be visually bright, or it can
have bright aromas and flavors; in both
cases, the opposite is dull.
cask: A relatively large wooden container
for making or storing wine.
castello: Italian for castle; refers to a wine
estate.
cedary: Having aromas or flavors that
resemble the smell of cedar wood.
character: An anthropomorphic attribute
of wines that give the impression of having
substance and integrity.
charry: Having aromas or flavors that sug-
gest burnt wood or charred wood.
chateau: A French name for a grand winery
estate, commonly used in the Bordeaux
region as well as other regions.
378
Part VIII: Appendixes 

classico: An Italian term applicable to cer-
tain DOC or DOCG wines whose vineyards
are situated in the original, classic part of
the territory for that particular type of wine.
clone: A subvariety of a grape variety; a
vine, or set of genetically identical vines,
that exhibits characteristics specific to it as
compared to other vines of the same variety.
colheita: Vintage, in Portuguese.
commune: A village, and its surrounding
vineyard territory.
compact: A descriptor for wines that give
the impression of being intense but not full.
complex: Having a multiplicity of aromas
and flavors 
concentrated: A descriptor for wines with
aromas and flavors that are dense rather
than dilute.
concentration: A characteristic of wines
whose flavors or fruit character are tightly
knit as opposed to being dilute or watery.
cosecha: Vintage, in Spanish.
crisp: A wine that feels clean and slightly
brittle in your mouth; the opposite of
“soft.” Crispness is usually the result of
high acidity, and crisp wines therefore are
usually relatively light in body and go well
with food.
decant: To transfer wine from a bottle to
another container, either for the purpose
of aerating the wine or to separate a red
wine from its sediment.
depth: A characteristic of fine wines that
give the impression of having many layers
of taste, rather than being flat and one-
dimensional; a positive trait.
dilute: A descriptor for wines whose
aromas and flavors are thin and watery,
as opposed to concentrated; a negative
characteristic.
district: A geographic entity more specific
than a region and less specific than a 
commune.
DO: Abbreviation for Denominación de
Origen, which translates to place name;
Spain’s official category for wines whose
name, origin, grape varieties, and other
defining factors are regulated by law.
Also an abbreviation for Portugal’s highest
official wine category, Denominação de
Origem, translated similarly and having the
same meaning.
DOC: Abbreviation for Denominazione di
Origine Controllata, which translates to con-
trolled place name; Italy’s official category
for wines whose name, origin, grape 
varieties, and other defining factors are
regulated by law.
DOCG: Abbreviation for Denominazione
di Origine Controllata e Garantita, which
translates to controlled and guaranteed
place name; Italy’s official category for its
highest-ranking wines.
domaine: A French term for wine estate,
commonly used in the Burgundy region.
dry: A wine that is not sweet. The word dry
can also describe the texture of a wine that
feels rough in your mouth, as in dry texture
or dry mouthfeel. But when used alone, it
refers specifically to lack of sweetness.
dull: A wine whose expression is muddled
and unclear. This term can apply to a
wine’s appearance, to its aromas and 
flavors, or to its general style. It is a 
negative characteristic.
379
Appendix B: Glossary of Wine Terms

earthy: Having aromas and flavors that
suggest earth, such as wet soil, dry earth,
certain minerally aromas, and so forth.
This term is sometimes used as a
euphemism for wines that are rustic
and lack refinement.
elegance: An attribute of wines that
express themselves in a fine or delicate
manner as opposed to an intense or force-
ful way — considered a positive trait.
estate: A property that grows grapes and
produces wines from its own vineyards;
wines labeled estate-bottled are made from
vineyards owned by (or in some cases,
under the direct control of) the same
entity that owns the winery and makes the
wine; use of the term is regulated by law in
most areas.
fermentation: The natural process by which
the sugar in grape juice is transformed into
alcohol (and the juice is thus transformed
into wine) through the action of yeasts.
finish: The final impressions a wine gives
after you have swallowed it or spat it out;
aftertaste.
firm: A descriptor for wines that are not
soft, but are not harsh and tough; generally
relates to the tannic content of a red wine
or the acidity of a white wine.
flabby: A perjorative term used to describe
wines that taste too soft, generally due to a
lack of acidity or tannin.
flavor intensity: The degree to which a
wine’s flavors are pronounced and easily
observable.
flavors: Aromatic constituents of a wine
that are perceived in the mouth.
fleshy: A descriptor for a rich textural or
tactile impression of some wines.
fortified wine: A wine that has had alcohol
added to it.
French oak: Oak wood from the forests
of France, of the species quercus robur,
considered the finest type of oak for aging
most white wines; the barrels made from
such wood.
fruit character: Those characteristics of a
wine that derive from the grapes, such as a
wine’s aromas and flavors.
fruity: Having aromas and flavors suggestive
of fruit. This is a broad descriptor; in some
cases the fruity aroma or flavor of a wine
can be described more precisely as sugges-
tive of fresh fruit, dried fruit, or cooked fruit,
or even more precisely as a specific fresh,
dried, or cooked fruit, such as fresh apples,
dried figs, or strawberry jam.
full: A descriptor for wines that give the
impression of being large and weighty in
your mouth. A wine’s fullness can derive
from high alcohol or from other aspects of
the wine. A wine can be pleasantly full or too
full, depending on one’s taste preferences.
garrafeira: A Portuguese term for a reserva
wine with specific aging requirements —
for red wines, at least three years of aging
in oak and bottle before release.
generous: A descriptor for wines whose
characteristics are expressive and easy to

skins.
380
Part VIII: Appendixes 

grape variety: A distinct type of grape
within a species.
harmonious: A flattering descriptor of
wines that are not only well balanced but
also express themselves in a particularly
graceful manner.
herbal: Having aromas and flavors that
suggest herbs, such as fresh herbs, dried
herbs, or specific herbs (rosemary, thyme,
tarragon, and so forth).
intense: Usually used in reference to a
wine’s aromas and flavors, to describe the
volume of those aromas or flavors — how
strong the smell of lemon is in the wine, for
example.
lees: Grape solids and dead yeast cells that
precipitate to the bottom of a wine vessel
after fermentation.
length: A characteristic of fine wines that
give a sustained sensory impression
across the length of the tongue.
maceration: The process of soaking the
skins of red grapes in their grape juice to
leach the skins’ color, tannin, and other
substances into the juice.
malolactic fermentation: A natural conver-
sion of harsh malic acid into milder lactic
acid, which weakens the total acidity of a
wine; an optional process in white wine
production.
maturation: The aging period at the winery
during which a wine evolves to a state
of readiness for bottling; the process of
development and evolution that fine wines
undergo after they are bottled.
medium-dry: A term to indicate the per-
ceived sweetness of wines that are very
slightly sweet.
medium-sweet: A term to indicate the per-
ceived sweetness level of wines that are
sweeter than medium-dry, but not fully
sweet.
minerally: Having aromas or flavors that
suggest minerals (as opposed to organic
substances such as plants or animals).
This is a broad descriptor; in some cases
the minerally aroma or flavor of a wine can
be described more precisely as suggestive
of chalk, iron, steel, and so forth.
new oak: Oak barrels that are used for the
first time to make a particular wine; can
also refer to a group of barrels that includes
first-use to third-use barrels. 
New World: Collective term for those 
winemaking countries of the world that
are situated outside of Europe.
nutty: Having aromas or flavors that sug-
gest nuts. This is a broad descriptor; in
some cases the nutty aroma or flavor of a
wine can be described more precisely as
suggestive of roasted nuts, toasted nuts,
nut butter, or cashews, almonds, hazelnuts,
and so forth.
oaky: Having characteristics that derive
from oak, such as toastiness, smokiness, a
charry smell or flavor, vanilla aroma, or a
higher tannin level than the wine might
ordinarily have. Usually these oaky char-
acteristics occur as the wine ages in oak 
barrels, but in very inexpensive wines they
may have been added as an actual flavoring.
off-dry: A generalized term for wines that
are neither fully dry nor very sweet.
old oak: Oak barrels or casks that are old
enough to have lost most of their oaky
character, generally three years old and
older.
381
Appendix B: Glossary of Wine Terms

old vines: An unregulated term for grape
vines whose fruit quality presumably is
quite good due to the fact the vines are
old — generally 40 years old or older —
and therefore produce a very small crop
of concentrated grapes.
Old World: Collective term for the wine-
making countries of Europe.
palate: A term used by wine tasters as a
synonym for “mouth,” or to refer to the
characteristics of a wine that manifest in
the taster’s mouth.

pretty: An anthropomorphic descriptor for
wines that are attractive for their delicacy
and finesse.
primary aromas: Fresh aromas in a wine
that derive from the grapes used to make
that wine.
red grapes: Wine grapes that have a deep
reddish or blue pigmentation in their skins;
also called black grapes.
region: A geographical entity less specific
than a district, but more specific than a
country; for Italian wines, the term
“region” applies to the political entity as
well as to the wine zones within that area.
reserva: On a Spanish wine, a term indicat-
ing that the wine has aged longer at the
winery (usually some specified combina-
tion of oak aging and bottle aging) than a
non-reserva version of the same type of
wine; red reserva wines must age at least
three years (with a year in oak) before
release. On a Portuguese wine, a wine of
superior quality from a single vintage.
reserve: A designation for wines that are
presumably finer than the non-reserve
(normal) version of the same wine; use of
the term is unregulated in the United
States and in France.
residual sugar: Sugar remaining in the
wine after fermentation.
rich: A descriptor of wines that offer an
abundance of flavor, texture, or other sen-
sory perceptions.
riserva: Italian word for “reserve,” indicat-
ing a wine that has aged longer before
release from the winery than a non-reserve
version of the same type of wine, and sug-
gesting higher quality; the period of time a
wine must age to earn the term “riserva”
(and sometimes the conditions of that
aging) is defined by individual DOC regula-
tions for each wine that may use this term.
round: A descriptor for wines that are per-
ceived in the mouth to be neither flat nor
angular. Roundness relates to the wine’s
structure — that is, its particular makeup
of acid, tannin, sweetness, and alcohol,
which dictates texture and mouthfeel.
second-label wine: A less-expensive,
second wine (or a second brand of wine)
made by a winery from grapes or wine not
considered worthy of the winery’s primary
label.
382
Part VIII: Appendixes 

sediment: The solid residue in a bottle of
red wine that forms as the wine matures.
serious: A metaphorical descriptor for a
wine that is of high quality, as opposed to a
popularly styled, mass-market wine.
silky: Having a supple, smooth texture.
single-vineyard wine: A wine that is made
from the grapes of a single (presumably
exceptionally good) plot of land, and that
usually carries the name of the vineyard
on its label; the term is unregulated in
that “vineyard” is not defined as to size or
ownership.
skin contact: The process during which
the juice of grapes rests in contact with the
grape skins; in red wine, the process by
which the wines absorb color, tannin, and
other substances; not normally used in
white wine production, but occasionally
used to enhance the aromatic character
of the wine.
smoky: Having aromas or flavors that sug-
gest smoke or smoked wood.
smooth: Descriptor for a wine whose tex-
ture is not rough or harsh.
soft: Textural descriptor for a wine whose
alcohol and sugar (if any) dominate its
acidity and tannin, resulting in a lack of
hardness or roughness.
stemmy: Descriptor for red wines that
give the impression of having dry, raspy,
woody tannins, as if from the stems of
grape bunches.
stems: The woody part of a grape bunch,
which are high in tannin; usually the
stems are removed and discarded prior
to fermentation.
stony: Having minerally aromas or flavors
that suggest stones. In some cases the
stony aroma or flavor of a wine can be
described more precisely as suggestive of
wet stones.
structural components: Principally, a wine’s
alcohol, acid, tannin, and sugar (if any).
structure: That part of a wine’s taste that
derives from perception of the wine’s
structural elements.
style: The set of characteristics through
which a wine manifests itself.
supple: A descriptor for wines that seem
fluid in texture in the mouth, without
roughness or sharpness; a positive trait.
süssreserve: German for sweet reserve;
unfermented grape juice that is added to a
white wine to increase the wine’s residual
sugar and sweetness.
sweetness: The impression of sugary
taste in a wine, which can be due to the
presence of residual sugar or to other
sweet-tasting substances in the wine, such
as alcohol.
tannic: A word used to describe wines that
seem to be high in tannin.
tannin: A substance in the skins, stems,
and seeds of grapes; a principal component
of red wines, which — unlike white wines —
are made by using the grape skins. Tannin
also is a component of oak barrels.
tarry: Having aromas or flavors that sug-
gest fresh tar.
tart: A descriptor for aromas or flavors of
under-ripe fruit. This term can also apply
to a wine that is too high in acid.
383
Appendix B: Glossary of Wine Terms

taste: A general term for the totality of
impressions a wine gives in the mouth;
more specifically, the primary tastes
found in wine: sweetness, sourness, and
bitterness.
terroir: A French word that is the collec-
tive term for the growing conditions in a
vineyard, such as climate, soil, drainage,
slope, altitude, topography, and so on.
texture: A wine’s consistency or feel in the
mouth.
thin: A word used to describe wines that
are lacking in substance.
tight: A descriptor for wines that seem to be
inexpressive. This term can apply to a wine’s
aromas and flavors, or to its structure.
underbrush: Aromas or flavors that suggest
wet leaves, dampness, and slight decay; a
welcome note in many older reds.
varietal: A wine named for the sole or the
principal grape variety from which it was
made.
varietal character: The characteristics of a
wine that are attributable to the grape vari-
ety from which it was made.
vegetal: Having aromas or flavors that sug-
gest vegetables, such as green peppers or
asparagus; these can be pleasant or not,
depending on the taster.
vin de pays: French phrase for country
wine; legally, a category of French wine
that holds lower status than AOC wines.
vinification: The activity of making grape
juice into wine.
vintage: The year in which a wine’s grapes
grew and were harvested; sometimes used
as a synonym for the grape harvest.
viticulture: The activity of growing grapes.
Vitis vinifera: The species to which most
of the world’s wine grapes belong.
weight: The impression of a wine’s volume
in the mouth.
wood tannin: Those tannins in a wine that
are attributable to the barrels in which the
wine aged, as opposed to the grapes.
yeasts: One-cell microorganisms responsi-
ble for transforming grape juice into wine.

Vintage Wine Chart: 1985–2004
A
ny vintage wine chart must be regarded as a rough guide — a
general, average rating of the vintage year in a particular wine region.
Remember that many wines will always be exceptions to the vintage’s rating.
For example, some wine producers will manage to find a way to make a
decent — even fine — wine in a so-called poor vintage.
