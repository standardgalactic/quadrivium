American by storm is now o f  Phantom of the Opera
set to reveal itself onto a n d  Batman, Darkman,
computer screens next s t a r r i n g  Liam Neeson,

1%1 E I A / S
follows the story of Dr
Peyton Westlake, a
brilliant young scientist in
love with attorney Julie
and close to a
breakthrough in his
research on synthetic skin
(which would only let you
go out in the dark!).
One night at the lab an
unscrupulous gang of big
bad baddies, searching for
a incriminating document
written by Westlake's
girlie, beat Westlake to a
pulp leaving him for dead
and blow up the lab. But
you've guessed it, just like
many a good ﬁlm script,
the horribly disﬁgured
Westlake, left with an
uncontrollable rage and
superhuman strength from
hospital side-effects,
emerges as Darkman,
obsessed with revenge
and one by one he plots
his retaliation.
YC cannot reveal what
the computer game will
emerge like, but it
promises to be a good old
gorey action-packed
bundle if it's anything like
the ﬁlm! See our Dark Man
Feature later in this issue!

Following on from Gazza's Super Soccer, now on the Addictive

Edition), Microprose Soccer and Football Manager 2, Empire have put
Gazza into his own limelight again in Gazza 2 or else he'd turn the

Gazza 2 according to Empire is about to kick off onto your screens
shortly and is in fact a "Kick Off" overhead style game compared to
the rather jerky side-on view in Super Soccer and wot with Gazza's
stardom since the World Cup, Empire are sure to have a top ten
computer hit at their feet.

CHRISTMAS SHOW
On a dark November afternoon, I trekked off to the 1990 Commodore Christmas
Show, hoping to brush shoulders with the rich and famous of computer games
people and trekked home again more than disappointed swinging my Robocop
carrier bag.
Yeah some of the big names were there:- Ocean had the nicest stand and I even
met Mr Robocop himself, who told me that YC was his fave read and who was I to
disagree, the Turtles were not there in person, unfortunately, but domed the
Mirrorsoft stand and everything in sight in sticker and empty Turtle drink carton
form. Domark were in Badlands promotion mode and Elite were being Gremlins in a
far-off corner. The most exciting person I met was programmer Tony Crowther of
Monty Mole and Bombuzal fame who chatted to YC about his non-C64 exploits. I
suppose any YC readers who attended were to be found in the Games Arcade where
all parents seemed to be dumping their kids to try to lose them whilst
technical/serious people could enjoy the most stands by looking at the new gadgets
and ad-ons for their mean machines.
Unless you wanted to snap up a few games on the cheap or explore the bigger
bytes of the Amiga computer, you would have been better off staying in and playing
your own games!

landed on the

graze on my knee. My
mum looked out of the

I'd done and I told her I'd
fallen over the kerb which
she didn't believe for a

had a big Rik shaped dent
in the roof. The owner

about 2 o'clock in the

AU"
g g T
everything he
had, everything
he was" the poster
copyline for DARKMAN,
the most recent movie
from cult schlock-horror
director Sam Raimi. This is
almost certainly true of the
character of Dr Peyton
Westlake, who becomes
the mysterious, bandaged
'Darkman' when Bad Guys
blow him up in his
laboratory; yet there's a
certain ironic application
of the statement to Raimi
himself, since his ﬁrst
movie for a major studio
(in this case, Universal
Pictures) almost broke
him.
The comic-horror
genius that unleashed
both EVIL DEAD movies
upon the world found
working under studio
supervision a little difﬁcult.
There were few enough
problems on the ﬁnancial
side - Raimi's EVIL DEAD
pictures had never made a
lot of money, and he
needed $14 million
working dollars to make
DARKMAN , but Universal
were pleased with his
"inoffensive" action
picture idea about a
hideously disﬁgured man
able to change or mould
his face to become his old
self or, if the situation
called for it, somebody
else. The difﬁculties came
in trying to liaise Raimi's
unconventional approach
to almost every shot and
the studio's need for a
I F E A C T U R E
regular action pic. It's a
liaison, however, that
DARKMAN manages
admirably.
"If you direct a whole
movie," Raimi says with a
wicked smile, "they can't
cut your personality out of
the thing!" He must be
right, for the delightfully
fresh camera movements
and angles, the black
humour and the grisly
special effects that made
THE EVIL DEAD and its
sequel cult viewing in
Europe ("My pictures have
actually been very
unsuccessful in the
States," says Raimi. When
I made the ﬁrst EVIL
DEAD, I thought it was
going to die a miserable
death in a can
somewhere. But then
Palace stepped in and
gave it a big push, and
suddenly people in
England embraced the
picture!") are back with
some new twists and turns
in DARKMAN.
Liam Neeson (whose
once-promising career
becomes more doomed
with every badly-chosen
role) is far better than
average Dr Jekyll to the
special effects
department's Mr Hyde. His
dialogue and that of the
other actors, lacks
substance or credibility,
but Neeson's performance
takes the viewer back to
the best of the Thirties
horror pictures, when
hideous monsters became
sympathetic, if two-

dimensional, characters.
These movies were, it
seems, the director's
inspiration too:
"I used to really enjoy
the old Universal and
Hammer horror ﬁlms
where the monsters still
had characters - where
inside the hideous,
repulsive form was a man
plagued by an unfortunate
curse." The early
PHANTOM OF THE
OPERA, HUNCHBACK OF
NOIRE DAME and
FRANKENSTEIN pictures
all inﬂuenced DARKMAN,
Rairni states. "That theme
of the creature wanting to
be loved is so powerful to
me. In DARKMAN, we
wanted to ask 'what
makes somebody a
monster?' Is it the terrible
deeds which they commit,
or the forces which drive
them?"
All this sounds a bit
highbrow for a fun,
commercial picture like
DARKMAN, but here and
in the States, the movie
was accepted and
applauded by critics and
audiences alike - the latter
to the tune of a very
healthy $9 million opening-
weekend gross. Is Raimi
surprised that he's
suddenly struck it rich?
"Money is a funny
thing," he says, referring
to the leap in budget from
the ﬁrst EVIL DEAD
($500,000) to DARKMAN
(28 times that amount).
"The more money I have,
the less thinking I do. The
more toys I have, the less
creative I am. It really
changes the way a
movie's made." But what
about the surprising high
box-ofﬁce take of
DARKMAN? "I'm just a
director who's made one
move that'd made money
out of four," he demurs.
Modesty aside, however,
Raimi is aware that he can
demand more artistic
freedom for his next movie
which, it seems, will be a
a  third EVIL DEAD, this time
for another independent
studio rather than a big
F E I X T U R E
ﬁsh like Universal. Is this
choice thanks to the
problems and creative
differences he had with
Universal?
"It's the job of the
studio to make things that
appeal to the mass
audience." he explains,
"not something that is
special, or little. I
understood that. I knew it
was a collaborative
process." Raimi's healthy
devil-may-care attitude to
making each shot
'realistic' caused a few
problems with Universal
executives. The director
claims that this is because
he based the visual style
of DARKMAN on comic
books:
"Comic artists tend to
go for the most
melodramatic angle and
moment in each scene,
which is often visually bold
and graphic at the risk of
reality - they mess around
with perspectives and so
on. I approached the
camera angles in
DARKMAN in very much
the same way." The
studio, however, didn't
want things to become
"too weird", afraid that
DARKMAN would ﬁnd its
niche with the limited
audience of the EVIL
DEAD and its setluel. "I
did try to restrain myself,"
Raimi grins, "but some
people have said that I
didn't do a very good job!"
In another irony, Raimi
was keen to keep the tone
of the movie fairly tame so
that it would reach a wider
audience (this from the
man whose ﬁrst movie
was banned in Britain for
nearly seven years before
ﬁnally being re-released,
albeit still cut, in 1990),
while Universal steered
him towards an R-rating,
the standard American
horror movie certiﬁcation.
When the ﬁlm reached
Britain last November, 26
seconds were cut from the
18-certiﬁcate version to
allow a 15 rating to be
given upon the ﬁlms re-
submission to the BBFC (a
few seconds were cut
from the laboratory
electrocution scene, and a
highly entertaining
sequence involving a
gangster's ﬁngers and a
rival's cigar-cutter has
been lost completely,
much to Raimi's
disappointment.
"This is my ﬁrst studio
picture and I don't have
any say in whether they
should cut it," he shrugs.
"That's one reason that
EVIL DEAD III: ARMY OF
DARKNESS is being made
as an independent
venture". But maybe be
won't be safe even with
their more relaxed
attitudes: already he has
had to drop the previous
title, MEDIEVAL DEAD,
perhaps because the joke
was too clever for middle-
American audiences.
Raimi remains
philosophical, however.
"Audiences love to get
kicked in the face," he
says. And Raimi is about
the best kicker this side of
Anﬁeld.

FROSTY THE SNOWMAN
Two player action in this highly seasonal
jaunt into Santa's grotto. This is a completely
original game that will keep you going well
into the new year (it's got us by the
Christmas balls).
DARTZ
Another original game (it's only ever
appeared on our sister title Commodore Disk
User, and that was yonks ago), based on the
very popular game that involves throwing
sharp objects at a round board from a
distance (sounds silly really). Can you
consume twenty pints of lager and get a
double top?

SUPER TACT
This game has also only ever appeared in
Commodore Disk User and is a very good
Ludo variant for the commy. "What's Ludo?"

Can you deliver all the

Grotto to him before
Christmas is just a
rumour and all the
the sucked)? But you
are a humble
snowman who will
surely end up as a
small puddle for some
brat to stomp in, why
should you do such a
thing?
Well, it's fun for a
start, and also there's
another snowman
who would love to get
in favour with the fat,
hairy old man. So it's
a race between the
two frozen fellows to
see who gets invited
to the Christmas'
household for a slap
up turkey feed. The
only prob is that this
is not altogether easy.
For a start, all along
the snow covered way
are pits that are -
to an aspiring Santa
helper. And added
hazards are mutant,
poor orphans have
nothing to show for
the time of year but a

Get out your beer
guts it's time to ﬂing
the old tungsten tips
at the circle. You can
grab a friend to thrash
in this very accurate
simulation of
everybody's favourite
pub game (what,
synchronised
puking?) darts.
Even Jocky Wilson
would be proud with
this set up. You can
play on your own (to
see if you can hit that
elusive nine dart
ﬁnish) or against
another, and it pretty
much follows the
rules of standard
match-play darts. You
must try to reach the
target of 501 by
throwing your arrows
at the board and
hopefully scoring
trebles of everything.
You must also ﬁnish
the game on a double.
To make this a little
harder, the cursor that
points to where you
are throwing wiggles
about as if you've a
few too many Irn

joystick manipulation
is called for here.
It's a fun game that is
best played by two

This is a very funky
variant of the ever so
popular board game
Ludo. What you have
to do is guide four
counters around the
circular board and
then up into your
home base. There's
many things that can
make this a pig to do
though, for a start you
must roll a six to start
one of your counters
on the board, and if

anybody lands on
your counter whilst it
is in play, it will be
sent home, and you
have to start all over
again.
All action is controlled
via a cursor which you
use to 'pick up' your
piece (the computer
will then move it the
required number of
spaces itself). Up to
four human controlled
players can
participate,
alternatively up to
four of them can be
computer controlled.
An average game
takes at least half-an-
hour, and we can
guarantee that this'll
cause a few
arguments in the
household.

my commie 64 when I
was suddenly bitten
by a nearby joystick that
was glowing. I feared at
the time that it could have
been radioactive, and my
fears were founded when I
realised that I had the
power to mysteriously
waggle myself in all
directions, I had a 15 inch
cord, no less than eight
microswitches, and an
auto-ﬁre ability that
allowed me to continually
spout whatever it was I
was spouting in the ﬁrst
place.
Dressing myself in a
costume that was
luminous green with
yellow blobby things for
my eye sockets I leapt into
the crime ﬁghting arena
calling myself
'Joystickman'.
00 ILIMI Oketkl M N t e l  AMA t

Unfortunately my career
was soon over when I
realised that waggling,
auto-ﬁring,
microswitching, and a long
cord, were really crap
powers. I'm now patiently
awaiting to be bitten by a
radioactive sausage-
making machine, then I
may not be able to kick
ass, but we'll enjoy a good
nosh up eh?
Peter Parker, a good
friend of the family (not my
family of course, but
somebody else's), was a
lot more fortunate. He was
bitten by a radioactive
arachnid (a spider to you
and me), and it gave him
the ability to cocoon all his
mates and then devour
them by sticking his
poisonous fangs into the
top of their heads and
sucking out all the meat.
He doesn't do this very
often though (It'd ruin his
street cred) so instead he
uses his other powers to
catch crims. He sticks to
walls and ceilings, which
would be a bit handy if you
were, say, appearing in a
Lionel Richie video, or for
changing the lightbulbs or
something. He also has
spider-like strength, an
acute sense of hearing,
and 'spider-sense' which
is an inbuilt alarm system
that clangs whenever
there's danger about. But
his ability to 'Spin a web,
any size' comes entirely
from his scientiﬁc
expertise, and he's built
two web guns that are
ﬁtted into the wrists of his
costume.
Now Peter has a rather
lovely wife called Mary
Jane and she's been

kidnapped by the evil
Mysterio. And in your
Spidey guise you must
venture into his lair and
rescue her, and if this isn't
a doddle then you should
hang up your web-slingers
and take up window
cleaning instead.
Unfortunately this isn't
a doddle, 'cause this
arcade adventure cum
platform game is huge. It
is set in the Rockwell Film
Studios, which is really an
excuse for the
programmer to have a
multitude of different sorts
of location, and instead of
having a simple, normal
platformy game, there are
thousands of puzzle
elements that must be
completed before you can
really progress.
This is normally in the
form of switches that must
be thrown for certain
doors to open, and for
passages to unblock. But
sometimes the switches
for a door on a particular
screen will reside on a
screen about ﬁve locations
away. A lot of thinking
must be done, and a liking
for exploration is an
essential property. The
arcade factor is quite
dominant too. There are
tons of robots, mummies
and other minor denizens
all roaming around, and if
they touch you your
energy bar is sapped
faster than a forest visited
by a glue manufacturer's
convention.
The energy bar also
has chunks ripped out of it
when you tread on a trap,
crushed by moving
platforms, touch electriﬁed
walls or ﬂoors, and
generally when you do
anything other than pack
your Spidey bag and go
down the pub. Fortunately
for you, although that
Mysterio is literally a
Mystery, the major villain
has supplied a few healing
rooms scattered around
the building, they'll restock
your entire energy and
leave you with that glow
that you'd only normally
get after using a very soft
toilet paper.
And if you chuck in the
fact that you can stand,
crawl, and crouch
anywhere - on the ceiling,
ﬂoor and walls - and you
can shoot webs at
baddies and at other walls
to help you ascend, you
just about have it. The
main character sprite is
absolutely tiny, but he's
better animated than
anything I've ever seen
("256 sprites of animation"
boasts the box) and the
rest of the graphics,
although basic, have
something of a well-
designed look about them.
The playability is where
this little superbaby cooks
though. Once you've
gotten used to the weird
happenings of a man that
can stick to even teﬂon
coated surfaces, you'll be
as hooked as the man wh
once exclaimed "Ooo, I've
0  0oh, he's got him by the clappers. Spin your web spidey,
otherwise you may never have children, and that would make
Mary Jane really sore!!!

in the air, young addicts
had their hands on the
phone, parents had their
hands in their pockets and
the line operators and
British Telecom had their
hands full of dirty dosh
ready to be stashed in
industrial-sized bank
vaults.
Then a strict code of
practice (a list of do's and
don'ts) was slapped on
0898 operators and
everyone forgot about
them for a long while. But
now they're back, BACK
BACK!
In recent months
there've been little adverts
for 0898 services creeping
into certain other shady
computer magazines
(cross ﬁngers, hope that
Rik hasn't sold loads of
YC's advertising space to
them this month) like
Zzzzzzzzzzzap and
Computer and Vegetable
Games.
So ...what in the world
are they, why, who are the
shady Mr./Ms. Bigs that
run them, who makes the
cash and are they safe to
call - or will British
Telecom come and take
away your phone and get
the Police to arrest you?
"I hear you,
Telephone Thing,
listening in ..."
- THE FALL:
"Telephone Thing"
When you dial one of
those message-based
0898 numbers (not the
chatline ones) - and the
range is astounding, from
dial-a-doctor to dial-a-
girlie - you get put through
to BT's computer. In this
computer are all the
recorded messages for the
lines and, after the
computer has worked out
which line you've dialled,
the appropriate message
is played.
At the moment it
sounds much like ringing
an answering machine
(crackle, garble, grate) but
as you read this, BT
should have turned the
system digital. In the case
of, say the Mel Croucher
Computer Fun Line, this
means it will sound like
Uncle Mel is sitting next to
you (shudder!).
The main feature of
them is the cost (which is,
but the way, imminently to
rise even higher). As the
ads say: "Calls are
charged at 25p per minute
cheap rate and 38p per
minute at all other times."
Of the 25p of 38p, 17.5p
goes to the person who
runs the line and the rest
goes to BT.
Some of the most
popular lines have tapes
that run for 3 minutes so,
as you can calculate (er...
25p+25p+25p = 75p,
38p+38p=38p=E1 .14) it
can get expensive very
fast. Some other lines go
on for much longer and it's
very easy to get bound up
listening to them so that
you don't notice how long
(and how much) you're
spending.
"Ring, ring, why
don't you give me
a call?"
- ABBA: "Ring
Ring"
The lines themselves
are an odd mix. They've
got something of a
reputation but really are, in
the main, "mostly
harmless". Especially the
computer orientated ones.
Mel Croucher's line

contains a lot of
computer industry in-
jokes - it's a slanted and
satirical look at the
industry news and
rumours of the last week
with Mel's words of
wisdom and some neat
sound effects and music.
Compared to this, the
"Megatip Gameslines"
was, yaaaaaawn, boring. I
lasted 15 seconds before
I put the phone down. I
suppose I wasn't looking
for any tips but is it worth
75p to hear someone
sayings things along the
lines of "Spam Invaders;
Drive your ship left and
up the wrong way alo
the track, you'll hear
pinging noise, now h
back again".
Aaaaaaaargh! B o r i n g s . ,
Perhaps the most
interesting (apart from the
damp squib "How do you
score with girlies" line -
wouldn't it be better to b
out there ﬁnding them
rather to talking to a
computer? I know I prefe
it) was the "Naughty Joke
Line" - now that was
tunny, as were the truly
tasteless jokes
advertising alongside.
Such gems as (and
you'll have to forgive me
if I don't tell it quite right -
this is from memory):
'Bruce and Bruce go into
town and win a talent
contest in a pub. Bruce
wins a bogbrush. After
returning, the two Bruces
don't see each other for a
while but one day, they
meet in the street. Says
Bruce: "Is that bogbrush
any use", says the other
Bruce: "Naah, so I went
back to using the loo
roll!". Boom, boom, as
Basil Brush used to say.
This line ran and ran. It
must have cost a fortune
to listen. Thank God YC
was paying my bill (what
do you mean "No it's
not", Rik?).

s, who
Ines (Mel
Croucher line, Megatip
Gamesline, SAM Coupe
Hotline, Tony (Mr. Polite)
Takoushi Console Line)
thinks people rung them
because of a "hunger for
information". Much like
that Jesus Jones song.
He says his lines get at
least a thousand calls in
the day and he doesn't like
his service being
compared to 0898 "dial a
woman to talk dirty 'pervo-
lines'. "I provide a quality
service" he says.
And just who are his
lines aimed at? "With
Mel's line, most or every
games software house
listens to it every week to
see what we're saying on
it!" he reckons. (Mel
Croucher, meanwhile, who
claims he gets a "modest
fee" for his three minute
epics, says "It's therapy".)
The SAM Coupe line is
for those poor souls who
have no support in the
world for their abandoned
"Telephone
Operator, why can't
I call you later ...?"
- PETE SHELLEY:
"Telephone Operator".
The fact that they're so
abnormally expensive
makes them quite a dodgy
bet for the consumer. The
companies that run them
love them, though. One
computer related
company's line is
rumoured to have made
computer, the Tony
Takoushi Console Line has
a self explanatory
audience and the Megatip
Gamesline is compiled by
the people who make the
'Action Screenplay' mag-
on-a-vid and is designed
to be "authoritative".
Hmmm.
Bruce runs all his lines
according to the strict
code of practice. For
example, part of this code
means that he has to put
his name and address on
the ads, along with the call
costs and, if the lines are
aimed at under 18's, a line
that says something along
the lines of "These calls
cost more than normal,
please ask your parents
before you call.".
nearly E45,000. There
could well be more money
in these phone lines for
them than in what they
normally do!
My advice would be to
steer clear unless you
have a very ﬁrm idea of
how long you're going to
be on them and where the
cash is coming from - and
as for chatlines: the bill will
undoubtedly be
astronomical! Get out and
about - do things, meet
people.

CHALLENGE

you cross Pacman
with a bit of
Plotting, a bit of Curse of
Ra, and some Bombuzal
thrown in for good
measure? Not Chip's
Challenge because it's
really rather more original
than ﬁrst impressions
would have you think.
You are Chip, which is
really a stupid name for a
piece of potato let alone a
strapping young geezer,
and you are rather
desperate to join the Bit
Busters computer club.
Wh a t  w e  wo u ld n 't  ad vise you to do, unless yo u 're
either a technical wizard  o r a p sych o p at h ic man iac,

you g e t  d o w n  M a c Do n a l d s .  Ri k  He n d e rs o n  loses his
chips with this ﬁendish n e w  p u zzle g a me  f ro m U S  Gee.
Unfortunately it's not like
the masons or anything
and you'll not get in by just
showing your right nipple
and rolling up your trouser
leg, nope this club is run
by Melinda the Mental
Marvel.
Now she's a bit of an
old cow who'd love to see
Chip squirm in front of her,
and he would because he
wants to join the club so
badly (especially to get his
hands on a rather fetching
Bit Busters T-Shirt), so
instead she's given him a
rather hard task to perform
before he can become a
member (anybody this
stupid would have to be a
member already, if you get
my drift).
So what he must do is
go through 149 (stupid
number yes, lots of them
certainly!) levels of
puzzling action. In all of
which he must collect a
number of chips (not the
hot, sweaty kind that you
ﬁnd accompanying your
slab of Plaice, but the
computery kind) that are
liberally scattered around
the gaff. But this is not as
easy as it sounds, there's
doors to be opened (with
the right coloured key), ice
to be avoided, along with
ﬁre and water, and more
hazards than the M25 on a
cold Friday night.

•
And you have to
work out ways to
collect them in a certain
order. Luckily the ﬁrst
ten levels are fairly
simple and allow you to
just get a grasp of
things, after that you
are in hardsville, and
it's no use running to
mummy 'cause once
you're in it's very hard
to come back out.
And not only do you
have to work out ways
to collect them but it
has to be done lickity
split, there's a clock that
F E W  EllAt
counts down while you're
thinking and time is of the
essence. Also on the score
panel is the number of the
level you are currently on
and the amount of chips
on the screen that are still
to be scooped up.
Fortunately each level also
has a code word so that
you can jot it down and
return to that screen at a
later date (there's nothing
worse than losing all of
your lives on level 148 and
having to play through
them all just to get the
ﬁnal one).
The graphics are not
spectacular, they do little
more than serve their
purpose, and the
music/SD( are as average
as they come, but the
gameplay is of the kind
that'll grab you by the
joystick and will not let go
no matter how much you
long to get into a lovely
warm bed.

Oi you, come over

I've got to say. Rik
came over to me the
other day and told me
that things have got
to change around
here. No longer can

of Scum of the Earth,
nope we're giving

Although the ranking

STREETS
Here it is kids, the
most comprehensive
guide to this game
ever to come out of
Scum city. I've been
slaving over a hot
kebab to bring you
this so you'd better
be thankful.
The main thing to
remember about this
game of mystery and
intrigue is that you
must thoroughly
search every location
in full, do not leave a
stone unturned.
You'll soon discover
that the suicide of
Carl Linsky was
indeed a murder and
that you're involved in
a far bigger plot than
ﬁrst impressions. In
fact you'll ﬁnd out that
Carl Linsky was a
scientist working on
project 'Overlord',
which is a satellite
that can completely
control people.
Behind this are the
men in charge of
Gideon Enterprises
and the Law and
Order party who are
obviously out to get
worldwide control.
The only way you can
stop them is to collect

eight passcards and
the passwords that go
with them from eight
scientists that are (or
were as Carl Linsky
was one of them)
working on the
satellite.
The best way to get
the passcards and
words is by searching
the scientists'
apartment when
they're not around,
but if they steadfastly
refuse to leave the
premises the right
type of conversation
will force them to part
with the necessaries.
THE PASSCARDS
These are the
passcards and the
words that go with
them
Green - Pawn
Yellow - Queen
Grey - King
Black - Rook
Orange -
Checkmate
Purple - Knight
Blue - Bishop
Red - Stalemate
When you have all
eight passcards and
words go to the main
computer at Gideon
Enterprises (4550).
Here you'll be
captured and put into
a room with a furnace,
you must get the
mask from the panel
and activate the
furnace by remote
control. A robot will
enter the room to stop
the furnace and you
should run through
the open door before
it closes.
You'll now ﬁnd
yourself in the
computer room and
you have just a
minute to enter all the
passcards and
passwords (saving at
this point is a very
good idea) before
you're caught. Once
you've done it you'll
Always write things
down, especially
location codes, that
pop up in
conversation. Write
down exactly who
knows who at all
times.
Never threaten
people, it'll only get
you a bruised nose,
try bribery instead.
If you run out of cash
you'll have to try a
spot of Bounty
Hunting, this gets far
easier when you've
got the knack.
Big Jim Slade will be
shot, you must hurry
with your questioning.
Robert Knott will also
be shot, but only if
be confronted by the
end sequence, well
C H  E A T S
GENERAL HINTS
you ask him about
Gideon Enterprises.
Although there are
many humourous
elements to the game,
it is a good idea to
solely concentrate on
the passcards, there
are a lot of red
herrings also (and a
few wild goose
chases). Never forget
that you can't
complete the game
without the cards, so
if anybody is shot,
and you can't get their
card all you can do is
switch the computer
off and go back to a
point that you've
saved.
Lastly, save often.

pixelised Ninja is back and
he's gonna make you wish
you'd never heard of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja
Girlies.
For a start he wears a
lovely Ninjistic shade of
black, not a dayglo red
mask, and he's more
interested in saving the
world than riding
skateboards and dancing.
Not once does he say "Yo

and it would be a sin to
hear him utter
"Cowabunga". Nope this
guy would rather take on
every bad 'dude' in the
world than make a movie,
'cause he's the hardest

classes, of course).

found himself stark naked
and standing with just a
bar of soap and a loofah
to protect himself from the

managed to ﬁnd a herd of
Sasquatches ('Big Foots
to you and me) who
swapped his soap and
long pokey thing for a
home-made Ninja outﬁt,
and they led him to the
gates of a rather big
temple that has just
appeared in the middle of
their community.
And it is here that you
ﬁnd yourself when the
game has loaded. And
thanks to piece of Walt

watch as your Ninja guy

games) is that somebody's
taken the status area and
completely redrawn it and
jiggled it around a bit. The
major changes to the area
is the inclusion of a prayer
wheel that spins to reveal
if you are standing next to
an object that you can
collect, it also reveals
what weapon any enemy
is using against you. This
is because of the second
major inclusion into the
status panel, the Bushido
indicator. If you ﬁght an
opponent with the same
weapon that he's using

you'll receive Bushido
points, and you need a
large amount of Bushido
to be able to complete the
game.
The rest of the panel is
similar to before with the
power bars, a 'using' box,
although for the ﬁrst time
there is a score box which
gives the game a little
more lastibility even if
you've completed it, you
can go back and try to do
it again but with a bigger
score.
The levels themselves
are not just simple temple
layouts, this time they're
based around four
elements and an extra one
thrown in for good
measure. There's Earth,
Wind and Fire (not based
upon the 70s pop combo
who sang the original
version of 'Fantasy),
Water, and lastly Void,
which is sort of based in
space, but sort of not if
you know what I mean.
Each level has a very
different graphical style,
and different puzzles that
long sharp suppository
that reside at the end of
each level, and only if you
give them a good
spanking can you get onto
the next.
Last Ninja 3 is not just a
heck of a lot better than
the original games due to
the depth, it's graphics are

must be completed before
you can progress. There
are also big Shoguns that
would like to give you a
second to none, and the
levels are absolutely
humungous in size. The
music is also gorgeous
and sweetly wafts out of
the computer like
bluebirds on the wind
(erm... sorry, a brief pansy
attack).

games) was the best game

fact absolutely everything
has been updated, so
much so that the abilities
of the commie 64 seem to
have been stretched so far
that nothing could
possibly expand upon it
(except, perhaps, Last
Ninja 4?). It is for this
reason that I have
absolutely no qualms
about proclaiming Last
Ninja 3 the best C64 game
EVER and I think I'll now
be able to retire to a small
cottage in Woking-On-

knowledge that I've

the company's back

4TH AND INCHES
This is the second best
American Football game
ever (second only to the
more recent challenge of
TV Sports Football) and is
also one of the best sport
-jmulations currently
available. It emulates the
crunching spankiness of
the hard hitting US sport
with a more arcade tint,
and from a side-on
perspective.
For those whose
knowledge of American
Football is limited to
adverts for chocolate
biscuits the idea of the
sport, and therefore this
game, is to progress the
oval football down the
ﬁeld and over the
opposition's endzone. Of
course they not only try to
stop you, but also try to
get the ball in their
possession in order to
score points themselves.
The rules are many but the
principle should be picked
up with little difﬁculty.
Apart from the major
arcade action you also get
the chance to choose the
players for your team, with
a choice of two for each
position. And when you
get to the play screen you
••••
• 1 1 - • • • • •
:;; tia41
realise that the whole
game is structured around
options and how you
perform those options,
and what a jolly option
orientated game it really
PAS J
is.
You can play against
the computer or against a
friend, and both offer
different variations of play.
A great old game with
enough violence to keep
even turtle fans happy.
OVERALL 89%
GRAND PRIX
CIRCUIT
And now we come to what
could be described as the
best motor racing
simulation game that has
graced the commie.
Again this is partly due
to the amount of options
that can be found before a
race or season. You can
choose what car you wish
to race from a Ferrari, a
Williams, and a McLaren,
and there's a difﬁculty
level that allows anybody
from beginner to super
stonky Nigel Mansell type
to have the same chance
of winning in the game.
Also when you get onto
the track you realise that
the game is still a cut
above the rather more oily
types available. The road
moves realistically and at
a fair speed for the
commie, and the other
cars seem to have more
intelligence than the blobs
that you ﬁnd in games like
Chase HO.

Just as Platinum is US Gee's Capcom coin-

made that up because the

there's absolutely no way

It is deﬁnitely
iﬂuenced by the
onslaught of Japanese

because you must leap,
bound and stab your way
across levels, whilst
collecting cash and
visiting lots of little shops.
If this sounds familiar you
can choose any one game
at random and you'd not
be far off.
The graphics are small
but cute, although the

was best just to wait for
the game to come out
'cause it wasn't half as
painful (unless you caught
your ﬁngers in the
datasette and some large
elephant came along and
sat on it).
California Games was the
most crucial of the Epyx
games range because it
drew away from the usual
sports theme and focused
entirely on excellent rad
pursuits, and still does of
course.
Skateboarding is there in
the form of the wicked
half-pipe which is a very
splendid version of the
sport. Surﬁng, foot-
bagging, roller-skating,
BMX biking and frisbee
throwing are also all
included and the only
thing you need to get the
whole thing together is a
small pile of sand, a bottle
of coke, and several
tanned hunks and babes
all gasping in awe at your
prowess.
What a great way to
spend a dreary, wet,

CRACK DOWN
This could honestly be
construed as the rudest
title ever to be released.
But if we take our minds
out of the gutter and think
of the game logically, it's
still the rudest title ever
released.
But it has nothing to do
with rudery as you are one
of a crack team of heroes
who must descend into a
rather nasty fellows base,
and blow it to kingdom
come with some rather
neatly placed explosives.
The screen in split into
two to allow another player
to also take part, and the
whole thing smacks rather
strongly of Gauntlet,
although in the best
possible way of course.
Crack Down was a
vastly underrated game
and should do well in its
new lease of life.

THUNDER BLADE
Here we come to the
Christmas turkey of the
bunch, although it was, on
reﬂection, slated perhaps a
little too much.
It's not the best game in
the world, but it isn't the
worst either. You get to
partake in a vertically-
scrolling shoot-em-up
revolved around
helicopters ('revolved'
geddit?) , and is
interspersed with 3D
sections.
The graphics aren't too
hot, but every cloud has a
dirty great lump of
magnesium just
underneath the silver lining
and Thunder Blade is Sega
Master Mix's.

DYNAMITE DUX
Here's another game
that never did too well in
it's ﬁrst lease of life
although it was one of the
best examples of cartoon
coin-op action that has
been around for ever and a
day.
You (and a mate if you
like) are a duck who must
biff, sock and pow his way
through loads of levels,
whilst avoid obvious traps
like manholes and bombs,
and less obvious ones like
bouncing moose heads.
The graphics are well
stonky, with big chunky
sprites, all in glorious
Disney-like colour, and the
music, and everything else
come to think of it, makes
the game that much more

is a driving game, but
they're not all similar. And
it was released at about
the same time as W.E.C.
Le Mans on the commie,
which goes to show that
driving games on our
computer were very much
ploppy bits at that time.

such excessive speed.
It's also far too easy, and

smack the other in the
nose with their hands in
large rubbery mittens (why
don't they have draw
strings that keep them
from losing them, like the

to be to see whose nose

the wheat from the
chaff.
US Gold's long term
conversion deal with coin-
op giants Capcom has
been most proliﬁc indeed.
You'd need a jolly large
number of hands, feet and
other multi-digited limbs
to be able to count how
many releases are
credited to the arcade
machine specialist label.
Now comes the decision
to release four of the most
recent licences, with a
rather spiffy older one
thrown in for absolutely no
extra wonga.
BLACK TIGER
Correct me if I'm
wrong, but Black Tiger
was never released on the
C64, due to the fact that
certain people felt that it
was a rather poor
conversion. If this is true
then I can only presume
that some form of forced
pessimism drug was taken
before hand 'cause it's not
really that bad, I'd even go
as far to say that I found it
quite playable.
Apart from the fact that
you play an ever so
cliched muscle-brained
hero/thug, the platform
action is fairly original and
ever so addictive. You
have to get from A to B in
a time limit and you have
weaponry to help you
wade through the plethora
of meanies, and that's
about it.
The graphics are pretty
bland, and the sprites are
tiny, but the game
certainly deserved to have
been released as a full-
price game, but let's just
be thankful that it's
included here.
OVERALL 83%
STRIDER
This is the highlight of
the pack, and it has to be
damn good to receive that
accolade.
Again it is a platform
game essentially where
you have to get from A to
B in a time limit, but the
sprites are a heck of a lot
bigger than those is Black
Tiger, and the animation is
pretty nifty I don't mind
telling you.

The plot comes straight
out of the Reds under the
bed text book, as you
must ﬁnally face the Grand
Master of the 'Red' army,
simultaneous action. And
there are loads of extra
weaponry to be collected.
The only major difference
is that you are a whole
after slashing your way
through the entire KGB,
and Siberian soldiers.
Fortunately you have a
laser-sword which slices,
dices and makes a mean
Siberian salad, and you
can somersault through
the air with much prowess.
The game is superb, if
a little small, and should
be considered as the
major selling point for
Platinum.
OVERALL 93%
FORGOTTEN
WORLDS
From the best of the
set to the poorest,
although Forgotten Worlds
has more going for it than,
say, Kenny Dalglish
Soccer Match.
It's a shoot-em-up, and
there's not much different
about it than the many
many horizontally scrolling
shooties of the past. There
are loads of meanies that
stream in formation
towards you. You can
have two player
person, instead of a piddly
little ship, and you can
rotate your gun all over the
shop, but this is the
reason that the game is a
little weak.
The gun waggling idea
is a reasonable one in
theory, but the controls
don't really work, and
you'd have to persevere to
make it all worthwhile.
OVERALL 71°/0
GHOULS'N'GHOSTS
This is also pretty
splendid as games go. It's
the sequel to the equally
wicked Ghosts and
Goblins and uses much of
the original ganneplay
ideas of the ﬁrst.
As you may have
guessed this involves
getting from point A to
point B in a certain time
limit (this seems to be a
tad too popular as a game
idea amongst those who
produce arcade
machines). In order to stop
you there are loads of
ghoolies who pop up all
over the gaff and try to
scare the willies out of you
(and generally
succeeding). At the end of
the levels are obligatory
big munchy meanies and
although it's all been done
before its fantastic
gripping gameplay makes
this a game that hooked,
and will hook, a large
amount of those who are
into this kind of thang.
OVERALL 9194
LED STORM
This is actually free and
is not included on the 16-
bit versions, which just
goes to show that
somebody at least has a
little bit of sympathy for us
life-long commie lovers.
And the game's not
that bad really. It's an
culow•tmit•suommr iimP400 (
-  •  • • •

NAME: Platinum
SUPPLIER: U.S Gold
PRICE: £10.99 tape, E14.99Disk.
RELEASE DATE: out now
update of Spyhunter,
based in a future time,
with loads of extra funky
bits that increase the
playability ten-fold.
There's not much more to
it apart from the fact, yep
you've guessed it, you
have to get from point A to
point B in the allotted time.
Ho well, not bad for a
freebie.
OVERALL 85%
So a collection of ﬁve
games, none of them
bad, most of them good,
go to make up one of
the better compilations
around this Chrimble.
Platinum is well worth
the greenbacks of
anybody's wad.

Computer Game
ASSEMBLY
1. Detach the Board from
the cover of the magazine.
2. Paste the Pieces,
Letters and Cards on the
back of a cereal packet
and cut them out where
marked. (You can
photocopy them if you
wish to leave the mag
intact).
3. Erect the Character
Pieces by folding where
shown and pasting 'A' to
'B'.
OBJECT OF THE
GAME
To be the ﬁrst player to
deliver his/her mail to the
eight locations on the
board, and to get back to
the Post Ofﬁce.
PREPERATION
1. Load the Post
Apocalypse computer
POCALUSEE
game into your C64 and
make sure the computer is
close to all players.
2. Hand out the Character
Cards and corrosponding
Character Pieces. (Try
doing this at random so
that there are no ﬁghts
around who gets who.)
3. Give each player one
Letter for each location
(the addresses are printed
on the letters).
4. Hand each player a
certain number of Booby
Trap Cards according to
the following rule:
If there are 2 players
playing hand out 4 cards
each.
If there are 3 players
playing hand out 3 cards
each.
If there are 4 players
playing hand out 2 cards
each.
5. Place all of the
Character Pieces on the
Post Ofﬁce square and
each player rolls the die
(via the computer game)
the highest number goes
ﬁrst, and play then rotates
clockwise.
PLAYING THE
GAME
1 On  your turn, roll the
die, and move that number
of spaces plus your
Character's Speed factor
in any direction (with the
exception of the 'One Way
System' squares - more
on them later).
2. You can only move from
the ouside street to the
inside (and vice versa) by
following the arrows that
lead from certain squares.
3. Wherever you land you
MUST obey the
information on that
square.
4. If you land on an
address square (any one
of the eight corners on the
inside and out) you may
mail the corrosponding
letter by taking it out of
your hand and placing it
on the discard pile. If
you've already delivered to
this address you can treat
the square as a park
bench (and take a rest).
5. If you land on any of the
other location squares
(Police Station, Post Ofﬁce
and Hospital) without
having been sent there
with a purpose, treat it as
a park bench.
6. If you land on a square
occupied by another
player you can challenge

THE BOARD GAME
him/her to combat
(explained in the
COMPUTER GAME
section).
7. If you land on a space
occupied by a Booby Trap
card (left by yourself or
another player) you must
press the relevant key on
the computer and act
upon what it says.
8. When you have
delivered all of your letters
you must land on the Post
Ofﬁce square, and the ﬁrst
player to have done so
wins the game.
BOOBY TRAPS
(Once Acquired)
When a player has a
Booby Trap card in his/her
possesion they can play it
at the end of his/her turn
on the square on the
board that he/she has
landed on. The next player
to land on that square
then has to select a Booby
Trap and follow the
results. If you have layed a
Booby Trap and you land
on it yourself you must
also follow the result.
ONE WAY
SYSTEM
If you land on a One Way
System square, the next
turn you must continue in
the direction that you were
going when you landed on
it.
THE COMPUTER
GAME
The computer game
handles the dice rolling,
combat and the selection
of Booby Trap and Mail
Shot Cards.
DICE ROLLING
This will select a random
number between 1 and 6
inclusive.
COMBAT
When you enter into
combat the Attacker must
enter his/her Attack
Rating, adding any
Weapon Bonuses, and the
Defender his/her Defence
Rating, adding any Armour
Bonuses. The computer
will adjudge the outcome
and the relevant player
must take note of what is
printed on screen.
BOOBY TRAP
CARDS
Whenever a player has
stepped on a Booby Trap
Card he/she must ﬁnd the
outcome by selecting this
option, and following what
is said. If it is a dud, the
player has escaped and
the Booby Trap on the
board is discarded, the
player then follows the
instructions on the square
as per normal.
MAIL SHOT
CARDS
Whenever a player lands on
a Mail Shot square he/she
must select the Mail Shot
option as many times as
applicable, and follow the
instructions each time. If
the ﬁrst Mail Shot selected
sends the player elsewhere,
and the original square
requested him/her to take 2
Mail Shots, the second is
ignored.
If a Booby Trap has
been found the player takes
a Booby Trap Card from the
pile for his/her use at a later
point in the game.
If a Weapon or Armour
Card has been selected, the
player must compare the
type of Weapon or Armour
received on the Armoury
Table and take a Bonus
Card with the suggested
bonus.

the popular Apple lithe
sequel
arrived in 1982 with the
third in the Wizardry series
following
in 1983. Things became
pretty quiet for a few
years. The series
was supposed to be

premium lately.
Consequently I
haven't
been able to squeeze in
any letters or the Golden
Oldie section I
promised a little while ago.
But they will appear - I
promise!
The excuse for this month
is a good one, however. A
special treat
for my loyal adventurers
('cause I know you've
been eating all of
your greens) that includes
a unique competition.
Okay chaps, to get you
into the right frame of
mind I want
you all to sit in the middle
of the ﬂoor (move the cat
to one
side), cross your legs,
straight back, chin up,
close your eyes
and go
"uuuummmmmmmm" ﬁve
times. Feeling pretty silly,
huh? Okay
then, we'll forget that. Just
delve a bit into your
memory. The
early eighties to be
precise. Those were the
days, eh?
During 1981, when new
computers and classic
games were
appearing by the bucketful
every other day, there
arose a new RPG
in the USA, from a
company called Sir-Tech.
Named Wizardry it
caused a sensation when
it appeared because it
used a new
perspective. A "through
the eyes", ﬁrst person
view. Thus
squashing the popular
opinion in the UK, that The
Bard's Tale was
the ﬁrst RPG to employ
this viewpoint. In fact, The
Bard's Tale
was to copy many of the
Wizardry features, when it
ﬁnally
appeared on the scene
many years later.
Initially appearing on
distributed in the UK and
Europe but high
costs and other difﬁculties
put a stop to that.
Conversions
arrived on the PC and then
Wizardry I was released
for the C64 -
in 1987! The extended

delay was mainly due to all
of the Sir-
Tech staff being so busy
creating new products
that the older
conversions had to take a
back seat.
As Wizardry II and
were being shifted to the
C64
Wizardry IV appeared on
THE WIZ
Creator of Wizardry V,
David Bradley, popped
'round to have
a chat recently. After ﬁnally
persuading him to stop
turning the
furniture into frogs I asked
the Wiz how he got into the
RPG game,
"When the home
computer came out I
started to try to
implement versions of the
original Adventure text
adventure.
Actually for the ﬁrst game I
ever had published,
Parathion Kings
by Avalon Hill in around
1983,1 had to go over to a
friend's
house to create it because
I couldn't afford a
computer at that
time!"
David began to play the
table-top RPGs, then he
progressed
to actually creating his own
scenarios. This lead to him
creating
a computer-based scenario. He
called it Dragon's Breath - no
relation to the Palace release.
"When Wizardry came out from
Sir-Tech it became very
popular. I was very taken by the
series and thought Sir-Tech
would be an ideal publisher for this
new game I'd designed. I
approached them in 1984, just after
Wizardry Ill had appeared.
They asked me if I would consider
re-writing it under the
Wizardry format. I made several
trips to Robert Wood head's house
(one of the original Wizardry
designers) and he taught me how
he and Andrew Greenburg had put
the Wizardry system together so
that
A A D A I E I M T L I  R E
R11)1VE AN ABSILVIELI SVNNINO NIPETITIN!
In an astounding bout of generosity brought about by ﬁlling the
management with ﬁve bottles of Vodka, Sir-Tech have given YC three
complete sets of the C64 version of Wizardry to bestow upon our
worthy readers (well, almost complete, there's no Wizardry IV
remember?). So, to win all
four games, which are only
available in this country at
vastly inﬂated import prices
from a couple of specialist
mail-order shops (about 630-
45 each!) all you have to do is
answer three eaaassssyyy
questions. First three out the
bag win a set each. So
heeeeres the questions!
1. H o w  m an y Wi z ar d r ys
were c o n v e r t e d  t o  t h e
C64?
2. Wh o  i s t h e  d e s i g n e r
of Wi z ar d r y V?
3. W h e n  d i d  Wi z a r d r y  I
ap p ear fo r  t h e  C 6 4 ?
There you go. Just send those
answers on a postcard or
asealed-down envelope. Mark
the thing "Wizardry Compo"
and send itto VC, Alphavite
Publications, 20 Potters Lane,
Kiln Farm, MiltonKeynes, MK11
3H F.
I could best translate my product
into Wizardry.
"At the time there was no
competition, so we ﬁnalised the
deal in 1985. I ﬁnished work on
Wizardry V in 1986. So now you
ask why wasn't it released until
1989?
"Well, the original designers
were now interested in other
things so it appeared that no-one
was available to do the other
scenarios. One of the obvious
reasons why they asked me to do
Wizardry V, therefore. After that
Robert Woodhead promised a
friend of his that he would get his
chance to write his idea for
a scenario (Wizardry IV). So despite
the fact that Wizardry V was
actually completed Wizardry IV was
written and everything was
jammed up until that was ﬁnished.
That was around 1988. They had
to wait another year before
Wizardry V could be released."

other formats, swiftly
followed, by the
ﬁnal instalment,
imaginatively called,
Wizardry V. The fourth
episode never appeared
on the C64 (although there
is still a
The closest
comparison I can
give you when you
play Wizardry
is The Bard's Tale.
You control a party
of characters
through a
chance it will be
converted). It was not as
popular as the rest
of the series. Mainly
because it has the
reputation of being the
most difﬁcult RPG ever
created! Wizardry V, for
the C64, did
appear in 1989, though.
Brenda Garno is a living
legend at Sir-Tech. She
has been
Sir-Tech's Games Master,
helping frustrated players
on a long-
standing helpline,
"I spent a lot of time
counselling people who
had lost a
character. Some people
get really upset. I became
a psychologist
for a while. They would
reminisce! They'd say,
"Hey, I used to
have this great ﬁghter. He
was just great. Let me tell

levels. You see
small graphics of
your adversaries
when you enter
combat. Spells can
be cast and

you about
some of the things he
used to do..." It was
almost like
remembering a long-lost
friend!"
Brenda's now in
product development -
writing manuals,
testing the software and
so on. Brenda holds the
world record for
completing every

V 15 hours. Not bad when
you consider that, on
average, you or I
would take about 100
hours to complete each
game. So how did the
lovely Brenda become
involved with Sir-Tech,
"I smoked non-menthol
cigarettes. The daughter
of the
President of the company
had run out of cigarettes
and was asking
for one. Everybody was
smoking menthols and she
didn't want one.
Eventually I gave her one.
l • - •
She said, "Do you have a
job?" I said
no. She said, "Have you
ever heard of Wizardry?" I
said no. She
said, "Have you ever heard
of Sir-Tech?" I said, again,
no. She asked me if I
wanted to hear about
Wizardry and I ended up
joining in 1983 on the
hotline."
Cigarettes may not be
• good for you but, it seems,
they get you jobs in
fantasy role-playing!

Messages and puzzles
abound as do
traps and other nasties.
Each Wizardry improves
on the last.
However, while the
game engine improves the
graphics do not.
In fact the graphics are
ruddy awful. The game
world consists of
simple black and white,
vector, line-drawings while
the enemy
character graphics are
basic and rather chunky.
Wizardry V does
improve somewhat, but
not enough.
However Sir-Tech say
that there is method in this
particular
madness. It is a question
of limited memory,
especially on the
C64. You do lose the fancy
graphios but you gain in
the depth of
the storyline and quality of
the gameplay. Sir-Tech
believe the American
public treat the Wizardry
series as a cult game.
Each episode is awaited
with baited
breath. There are normally
two questions on the lips
of all RPG
garners in the States. The
ﬁrst is, "When's the next
Ultima
release?", while the
second is "When's the
next Wizardry
release?".
The quality of play in
Wizardry I-Ill is similar to
that
found in The Bard's Tale
which is pretty remarkable
considering
the age of the ﬁrst three
games. Wizardry V has the
strongest
storyline of the series (with
the exception of Wizardry
IV, yet
to appear on the C64),
larger game maps and
enough changes in its
spells and method of play
to offset the basic
graphics. In Wiz V
there are plenty of
characters to chat to,
pools to swim in and
investigate, doors to pick,

ADVENTURE FANZINE ROUND•OP PIA
This month I'm taking a
slightly different subject
for the
monthly round-up.
Normally, all of the mags
covered appear on a
regular, monthly basis.
However, the following
beginner's guide
is a one-off publication.
Even so, it is worthy of
your attention
and there is a chance that
it may be updated on a
regular basis.

Many people have, at
one time or another
written a book on
adventures. On just about
every occasion there has
been some
reference to beginners.
Whether it's just been an
introductory
chapter or the whole book.
Writing such tome is
difﬁcult.
Firstly, because the author
is, generally, an
experienced
adventurer and, thus, may
ﬁnd it hard to visualise all
of the
elements that beginners
ﬁnd demanding. After all,
after a time
adventurers take many of
their skills for granted,
quickly
forgetting a number of the
details they found difﬁcult
when they
began, Secondly, such an
author will surely receive
some ﬂak
from some quarters for
omitting an "essential"
piece of
information. Generally
because authors of
beginner's guides tend
to forget or dismiss the
obvious - which is exactly
the sort o f
thing a beginner wants to
know about.
Dave Havard, with the
release of his beginner's
guide, has
attempted to put these
problems to rights. His
beginner's book is
by no means perfect (what
is?), however, it is good to
see this
neglected area addressed
at all.
Arriving on 50-pages, in
A5 format with a paper
cover the
Beginner's Guide is
divided into 11 chapters
and an appendix. The
ﬁrst two chapters describe
themes and adventure
types (text-
only, icon driven, etc). The
third, and largest, chapter
takes
you by the hand and
guides you through a
sample adventure
transcript (including pre-
drawn maps). In this case
a golden
oldie (literally!) - Artic's
Golden Apple. After a
chapter ﬁlled
with notes on the Golden
Apple and another chapter
on saving and
loading adventures Dave
discusses synonyms and
includes a
comprehensive sample list
that'll prove a handy
reference whilst
playing any adventure.
Chapter seven continues
the verb/noun
input discussion whilst
chapter eight expands into
a full
sentence parser debate.
After sections on
character interaction
and the dreaded maze
Dave devotes a chapter to
experienced
adventurers (describing
the workings of
adventures).
Dave Havard has had
an admirable stab at
creating a
beginner's guide.
However, I have three
gripes. Firstly, the book
is ridden with a number of
appalling spelling
mistakes (who
playtested the manual
Dave?).
Secondly, although the
basics are included I don't
think
they are given enough
space. I would have
preferred the book to
have dwelt on each point
much longer, introducing
multiple
examples in case the
beginner ﬁnds one,
particular example hard
to grasp.
Thirdly, I thought the
design could have had
more thought
given to it. The
introduction of the
transcript of the Golden
Apple appeared far too
soon. There should have
been a number of
individual discussions on
many more game
elements. Once the
reader had come to grips
with each single
component, then would
be the time to lump them
all together and introduce
the
transcript.
However, even with the
above criticisms the
Beginner's Guide
is still a recommended buy
as it includes many hints
and tips
never before seen
between two covers of a
single publication.
Excellent value for money.

a brilliant game..."

we? I mean it's not as if

EVERYBODY
NEEDS GOOD...
I've been buying
"Y64" since it was
ﬁrst published and will
continue to buy this
excellent magazine.
Living so far from
England we get the
magazine in the shops
here 5 or 6 weeks later
than when it's ﬁrst
published.
Nevertheless I eagerly
await its appearance in
the local shops. Having
2 to 3 games on one
cassette with each
issue represents
excellent value for
money.
Some of my favourite

A L E T T E R S
games include
'Popper', 'Rainbow
Chaser' (Is there an
end to this game? Or
do you just keep
collecting items?), and
'Frogs in Space'.
Also I'm an
intermediate
programmer in
machine code. I
haven't as yet felt
motivated to go the
whole way and write a
game as I have '
considered the need to
design sprites,
characters and the

I just wish to express./

PA: Y64? Erm... First I
thought that you might
have been writing to the
wrong magazine until you
mentioned Popper and
Rainbow Chaser (which
does end, honest!), but
now I reckon you need a
pair of glasses. Do you
have to pay for an eyetest
in Aussie land (like we
do)? I normally end up
sticking two milkbottles to
my eyes when I'm reading,
it may not work too well
but at least I get two free
pints of red top for my
money.
There's a few utilities
we've thought about
putting on the tape. We'd
put a Microwave emulator
on it but the tape melts
every time we try. If we get
anything together you'd
probably be the last to
know anyway (why don't
you get a subscription,
you'd get the mag pretty
much the same time as
the rest of the English \ \ i ,
Speaking world then?).

I think YC is the best
commy may around to
date, the only prob is
that there is not
enough colour. Also
why can't you have
games like SM.
(Sinclair User)? The
reason I say Sinclair
User is because my
friend is always
bragging about how
good S.U. is and howl"
good games like Terra
Cresta are.

PA: Nope I couldn't read
your writing at all, sorry!
Only joking (I bet I had you
worried). Just tell your
friend that his crummy
machine is nothing more
than an overelaborated
doorstop, and that your
commy games have more
colours on screen at once
than the entire Speccy has
in a whole game. If that
doesn't prove that he's
big mouth shove his .
inferior computer (and
magazine) down it.
Anyway YC's got me!!!
I think with one of
your free computer
game tapes you should
give away the whole or
one level of a three-D
game, also give 3-D
glasses because I have
always wanted to
know what 3-D
computer games are
like and it will give the
readers an experience
in 3-D games. It might
even attract more
people to the best ever
commy 64 magazine -
VC.
also want to see what
turtles is like because I
don't know whether to
get it for Christmas.
One other thing,
Sinclair User has
started giving tape
boxes with their free
games, I think you
should start doing that
because I'm running
out of tape boxes to
put them in.
Matthew Gibson,
Billericay, Essex
PA: Here's a treat for you.
Stick a piece of red see-
through plastic to your left
eye, and a piece of green
see-through plastic on
your right eye and look at
the following drawing. This
is a picture of me in 3-D
just for you.
And what is it that you've
all got about S.U., I think
I'm going Sinclair Crazy
(that sounds like a great
title for a magazine).
If you want to write to
Post Apocalypse, or
have yourself featured
in Pen Pal's Corner,
here's the address to
send your mail to: Post

and down track
record (if this isn't
prime comedy material then
my name's not Trevor and
Simon) when it comes to
racing games. Outrun
(which was poop) and
Turbo Outrun (a fabbo
game with stonky bits) both
spring to mind as the most
extreme, and now, due to
the new licensing deal with
arcade giants Sega, we are
to be graced with a
conversion of the coin-op
classic Super Monaco GP
(GP stands for Grand Prix,
or maybe Great Pixels or
something).
This will be converted by
Turbo Outrun's
programming team (and
just about everything else in
the history of C64 games)
Probe, so we're on the right
foot for a start. And from
initial looks (exclusively by
the YC wrecking crew -
"MC Hendy and the Spam
loving posse") if it isn't a
stonker I'm a cabbage stalk.
When you look at the
basics you realise there's
not really too much that's
any different from all the
other racing games that
have ﬂooded the market.
You sit at the seat of a big
throbbing formula one car,
and you have to race on
several varied courses,
doesn't sound too original
does it? But you do get the
option of racing with
automatic gears or by
manual, and there are ﬁve
gears as opposed to the
usual high and low that
we're normally limited to.
The graphics are slightly
different for an arcade
driving game in the fact that
the view from your car is
from the cockpit, instead of
the usual 'ﬂoating ten foot
behind the car and in a
slightly top down'
viewpoint. And at the top of
the screen is a mirror that
shows what is behind you
at any one point.
Along the track there are
loads of bends, etc. but
there are also instances
where you'll be forced to
travel through a tunnel, and
this is done in a inﬁnitely
better way than Chase HQ
(another arcade racing
game to feature this
method).
Super Monaco GP will
be THE game to watch out
for in the spring
(booiiiinngggII) and you'll be
able to catch a full review in
this mag in a short while.

coin-ops that falls
under the new
license deal with US Gold is
Shadow Dancer, a game
that is most deﬁnitely in the
beat-em-to-bits-and-then-
some category.
It owes a lot to games
like Dragon Ninja, Shinobi,
and even Midnight
Resistance, as you have
been grabbed by the
whatsits (the CIA or
somebody) and shoved
quite ﬁrmly into an airport
that has been overrun with
terrorists who have placed
several bombs all along a
horizontally-scrolling
landscape. Also guarding
them are lots of very hairy
fellows with horrible
moustaches and big
munchy guns, and they'll
not think twice about
drilling you full of more
holes than a rather baggy
string vest.
And what have those
rather clever chaps who've
assigned this task to you
given you to help? Nope,
not an UZI semi-automatic,
or even a small pistol.
rhey've given you a nice,
cuddly, white, ﬂuffy,
Alsation-like dog. See how
he leaps. See how he
bounds. See how he sniffs
other dogs' behinds and
pees up lamposts. Mega

after Rover.
Images is the
programming team
converting it (being
previously responsible for
the commie version of R-
Type among many others)
and from an initial view we
can safely say that it's
gonna be a must buy for
fans of Shinobi-type
games. The graphics are as
faithful to the original as
you're likely to get, and the
dog jumps about in a very
4111110111111k
smooth and realistic way
(showing very promising
animation for the rest of the
game too). The only minor
niggle that is bound to be
improved on before release
is that when the Shadow
Dancer himself is spewing
Ninja laser bolts at the
enemy it looks like he's
having a rather jolly rib-
tickling chuckle.

saga, although it's not
role-playing or arcade
adventure for once. In
fact it's rather more
original than any of the
others, and even more so
than any other game that
you'd care to mention.
Why? Well it's being
heralded as a 'dragon
simulator' which is
essentially similar to a
ﬂight simulator except
you can substitute the
airplane for a rather huge,
ﬁre-breathing, smoke
fatting dragon, and you
can throw the second
world war out of the
Rainbow Arts
A
pass that Turrican
was a rather stonky
shoot-em-up cum arcade
adventure and everybody
did go out and spend their
spondoolies on it and they
were more than pleased.
But the great Rainbow
Arts was not happy with
just having the one
window and insert a plot
based around knights,
bad breath and lances,
and the plight of a
fantasy land, if you can
name another game that
focuses around the same
idea I'll send you a large
Vindaloo with extra chile
powder, that'll make you
breath ﬁre.
You can progress
through over 20 different
missions, all of which
based in the land of
Ansalon, as you swoop,
rise and fart your way
over, under and through
the enemy. Look out for a

we reveal exactly what

Er... perhaps this isn't

Turrican II is being

a little leeway here, I mean
us journos have to have
some way of saying that a
game is rather wicked
without having to say that
a game is totally wicked,
and boy is Turrican II
smeggingly wicked.
It has everything the
original had, but more of it
and with tweaked
gameplay that is a lot

WHAT IS LIVE ROLE
PLAYING?
LRP is all about getting
away from it all for a few
hours. Dungeons and
Dragons players will know
what it's all about - taking
on the character of a Lord
of the Rings type of
persona, inventing a name
for them, and then
controlling what they do
by throwing dice.
LRP is different in that, as
well as thinking like the
fantasy character would,
you have to speak like
they would, act like they
would, dress like they
would, make facial
expressions - everything.
"Live" means just that -
you become the character
in a real-time situation,
face 'real' monsters, hit
things for real (within
safety limits of course),
and generally escape from
our world for a while and
join a new world of
monsters and magic.
In each system, things are
run differently. Some
places will let you play
Conan the Barbarian,
others Luke Skywalker
from Star Wars, others still
Mr. Spock or Captain Kirk.
You can live out your
fantasies, and have a lot of
fun too!
A FIRST-TIMER'S
COMMENTS
ASH:"What did you ﬁrst
feel when you arrived?"
CHELLE:"My ﬁrst
thoughts were that I
wouldn't enjoy the day at
all. Live Role Playing was
something that I'd never
done before (I've only
played D&D once), and I
wasn't sure that I could
get into the idea."
ASH:"Did the jargon put
you off, or did you have an
idea of what to do straight
away?"
CHELLE:"Well, don't get
me wrong, but all of the
jargon did put me off
rather a lot. I never did
understand a thing, I still
don't really."
ASH:"You mean the game
wasn't explained properly
to you from the start?"
CHELLE:"Yes it was, but
it all went over my head to
an extent. I knew that I
was playing another
character, running around
a load of woods and
hitting people with rubber
swords. I saw a few
people walking past, but I
didn't feel uncomfortable
in costume because
evrybody else was too."
ASH:"So, if you only had a
rough grasp of why you
were there, what did you
do about it?"
CHELLECI followed the
rest of the party around,
not really getting into
Jaspa's character until I
knew more about the
game, and what I•could do
- then I jumped in, feet
ﬁrst!"
ASH:"What happened to
get you more involved?"
CHELLE:"Well, some guy
went beserk. Everyone hit
the deck except me, and
he turned on me with
13 S
swords waving...
ASH:"Don't worry about it,
we've all had THAT
experience!"
CHELLE:"...well, I didn't
know what to do. Then I
felt someone grab me and
I was thrown down too!"
ASH:“Best thing under the
circumstances. Then what
did you think of the game,
once you got the hang of it
all?"
CHELLECI began to lose
my doubts about the
whole thing, and really
started to enjoy myself. I
really didn't give it a
chance before it started -
thought that the whole
idea was a waste of time
and stupid (something that
little kiddies get up to) -
but I was surprised and
encouraged by the
attendance of other girls
and the fact that everyone
was my age after all - not
a bunch of snotty
schoolkids.
"Apart from all of the gnat
bites (!) I really enjoyed the
day and I think that people
should get involved more.
It's really worth the effort
that people make to these
games (the organizers as
well as the players), and I
will be going again in the
very near future."
CATACOMBS - THE
YC ADVENTURE
by Sorella the Wyse
Life was dull in town.
Nothing much had
happened for weeks. An
odd job here and there of
course. Nothing too
ID

F E A C T L I P R E
outrageous though, so I
was more than ready for
the challenge that awaited
this summer's morning.
There was a commotion
towards the centre of
town. I headed that way,
and found a notice pinned
to a tree - "Help wanted".
That sounded right up my
street, so off I went in the
direction of the red light
district.
I met up with a small
group of people who had
had the same idea as I
had - to get rich quick on
a quest. There were many
strange and peculiar types
there; some were fur-clad
and carried huge
weapons; others were sly-
looking and shifty-eyed,
preferring the cover of the
shadows to the light. At
the centre of the group
there was the man who
had asked for help. He
stood, badly wounded, by
the body of a girl.
Keeping one eye on my
back, I approached the
man, and as no-one else
was talking much I took
charge of the situation.
"I understand that you
have a job for us to
accomplish. My name is
SoreIla."
He waved a sword at me.
"Come no closer. Yes, I
have a job for those who
are willing to perform it."
Whispers of magic came
from behind me. A tall,
fat humanoid creature
came up to me and said
quietlly "Be careful. He's
evil."
Bearing this in mind, I
began negotiations. It
seemed that he was evil
in purpose but not in
intent, and he had a
genuine quest t o  kill a
Ninja leader and bring
back his head. There was
also a scroll that he
would like back as well.
After offering us 200
Tigerans each (which I
negotiated to 1,000 per
item that we returned), he
left us, pointing in the
rough direction of a wood.
We set off. Ourscout, who
literally ran everywhere,
got to the entrance to the
wood ﬁrst. By the time I
arrived with the others a
ﬁght had broken out. I
soon hit the deck when a
large warrior got a glazed
look in his eyes and
started beserking!
Whilst on the groundI
found a potion bottle.
Hopefully it would come in
handy later, so I put it in
my pack.
When everything calmed
down, we moved on. We
came across an Oriental
type of person, who said
that he offered
knowledge. He told us to
put our ﬁst into his
bucket, and learn from the
fact that the hole in the
water went away when
you took your hand out!
I showed my contempt for
him by calling him a
suitably colourful name,
and he started going mad!
We killed him, but he kept
coming back to life until
we tipped out the water
from the bucket. Then a
warrior grabbed the
bucket and proclaimed it
as his own.
We proceeded without
further ado into the depths
of the wood. A Cosmic Elf
(at least, that was what he
claimed to be at ﬁrst)
greeted us and told us not
to go any further because
there was a dragon. But
when FO the beserker
started on him he cast a
cloud of magical darkness.
I didn't want to get
involved in the ﬁght so I
cast the illusion of a tree
around myself. I stood
very still and watched our
warriors get chased by the
charlatan Elf and another
Ninja.
The next person we met
(after the scout had dived
over three tripwires to get
some treasure) was a
Wood Elf. She had a pet
shambling mound who
looked like a big pile of
leaves. I thought that it
might be fun to be one too
so I cast an illusion
around myself again. So
did the beserker, and so
there were three
shambling mounds!
Things really started
getting confusing at that
point. An archer and his
bodyguards popped up
from nowhere and started
abusing us. Then we met
the big Ninja boss. He had
the power to leap over us
and disarmed the bucket
warrior, who he then
butchered.
The warriors killed the
henchmen and I and
another warrior, Axelan,
chased the boss. We
cornered him and killed
him. I had aquired the
bucket from its now-dead
carrier and so this was a
handy vessel for the head.
The scroll was hidden in
the balaclava, and I
stashed this away too.
AxeIan and I realised that
we were alone, so I
suggested running away
with the spoils. This we
did with great success,
and we got 1,000 Tigerans
each. We also found out
that the person who hired
us was the leader of the
outlaw tribe and when he
heard what we had done
he asked us to join them.
We agreed, and went
about our business as
sworn sword brothers, to
ﬁght again another day...
Daz and his system are
mobile. That is, Daz
has legs, and his
system is ﬂexible
enough to be used
anywhere there is a
woodland. To hire him
to go to a speciﬁc
location will cost his
travelling expenses
plus the usual fee of #7
per adventure. But you
can play at the
weekend locations by

violence that'll suit
even the hardened
psychopaths.
SHADOW OF
THE BEAST
The 16-bit wonder
hits the C64GS at
last!
Domark will be rereleasing
all of the old Tengen
range on cartridge. The
ﬁrst of which is
Vindicators, an ancient
blast that sees two
players compete with or
against each other in a
sort-of top-down view
tank game. It's all done
very well and is a very
good emulation of the
arcade machine. Originally
the game was a multiload
and really suffered
because of it. On
cartridge, of course, the
many screens are
available in a split second,
so it really lends itself to
the GS.
US Gold will be
supporting the new
machine with conversions
of a few of its old
catalogue and a promise
R E V I E W
to produce cartridge
versions of all its
forthcoming releases. The
most likely candidates for
release at the moment are
the excellent Strider (and
sequel), Turbo Outrun and
a few of the Capcom
games. Up and coming
are Super Monaco GP,
Shadow Dancer, G-Loc,
and that's just for starters.
Ocean's next release
(after Robocop 2 and
Shadow of the Beast) is
Pang, a cute game that
has you ﬁring arrows at a
multitude of different
coloured balloons. If this
sounds a tad similar to
you, then like me you
might remember the
yonks old Pooyan, but
we'll not mention that
shall we?

somebody in the distance
you can say goodbye to
the road.
Other than that it is a vast
improvement on the
original, and the speed at
which everything moves is
of a 16-bit quality. Also all
of the levels are there for
you without any fuss. If
you're looking for a
reasonably good driving
game this Chrimbo, Chase
HO 2 should certainly be
on your-mind.

He's back, with really
more of the same. This
time you've gotta collect
a new drug that's out on
the streets called 'Nuke',
and eliminate all of the
crinns that are connected
111
with it (of
course).
There are three
major levels and
a few sub games,
just like last time,
only the graphics
are a lot more
funky and the
gameplay has
been tweaked a
hell of a lot.
Robocop 2 looks
as if it's gonna be
one heck of a
sequel on the
C64GS, unlike the
movie (it was a bit

This was so popular on the 16-bits that it ﬁnally calls for a commie version. It's gonna be so huge though that it has
to be on cartridge only.
It's a fantasy based arcade adventure that needs super fast dexterity and a lot of lateral thinking to get anywhere,
and rumour has it that the gameplay will be twice as good as the original.

almost near completion is

LAST N I N J A 3
If you want the
main gist of what
this game is all
about, you'd do
better to skip along
to the main review
elsewhere in the
mag and read it,
wait here. Turn, t
turn... La, la, la.-
Right? Got it?
Good now I'll just update you on how even more stiffy
the game is on cartridge.
It's identical as its cassette and disk counterparts but
for the fact that it loads in one nanosecond (probably,
unfortunately my Daley Thompson stopwatch is only
accurate to one tenth of a second, and blew up when
tried to stop it any quicker), and all the corresponding
levels are also available to hand pronto. Other than that
you're looking at a
carbon copy in
terms of graphics,
presentation and
sound. And if you
expect the
gameplay to better
at all I just ask you
this - how can you
better the best?
There's so much going on though that the game has to
be crammed onto a 4 meg cartridge (in preference to
the 2 meg ones that just about everybody else uses)
and as such pushes the price up a bit. Therefore most
of you out there will ﬁnd that you have to save up loads
of cash just to get it, and those who just own a normal
C64 might do better to get the disk or cassette version.
You C64GS owners
though will have to
make your minds
up, but I'll tell you
that this game is
the cats goolies
and no mistake.

(CHASE HQ 2)
So here it is (Merry
Christmas,
everybody's having
fun) the sequel to
the game that
promised oh so
much and was a
rather ﬂoppy
sausage when it all
came down to it.
But will this meaty
comestible be a lovely
fried meal or yet more dog
food?
It's neither really, which is
a shame because in the
arcade it was so good that
I wet my pants when it
ﬁrst came out. The thrill of
the chase and the sheer
violence of the gun ﬁght
added together to make
any budding Mary
Whitehouse trade in her
knitting bag and adopt
leathers and a Magnum

original few
missions, the force
has given you a
gun to use during
the chase as well
as a beefed up car

to be honest).
