Change Password in LINUX 
 
How do I change the password in LINUX? 
 
To modify a user's password or your own password in LINUX use the passwd command. Open the 
terminal and then type the passwd command entering the new password, the characters entered do not 
display on screen, in order to avoid the password being seen by a passer-by. The passwd command 
prompts for the new password twice in order to detect any typing errors. The encrypted password is 
stored in /etc/shadow file.
