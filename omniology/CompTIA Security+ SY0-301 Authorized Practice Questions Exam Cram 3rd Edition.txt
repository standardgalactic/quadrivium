Introduction
Welcome to CompTIA Security+ SYO-301 Practice Questions Exam Cram. The sole
purpose of this book is to provide you with practice questions and answers and
explanations that will help you learn, drill, and review for the Security+
Certification (2011 Edition) exam. The book offers a large number of questions
to practice each exam objective and will help you assess your knowledge before
you take the real exam. The detailed answers to every question will help reinforce
your knowledge about different concepts covered on the Security+ (2011
Edition) exam.
Who This Book Is For
If you have studied the SY0-301 exam’s content and think you are ready to put
your knowledge to the test, but you are not sure that you want to take the real
exam yet, this book is for you! Maybe you have answered other practice ques-
tions or unsuccessfully taken the real exam, reviewed, and want to do more prac-
tice questions before going to take the real exam; this book is for you, too! Even
when the exam is done and you have passed with flying colors and have the
Security+ Certification in your pocket, keep the book handy on your desktop to
look for answers to your everyday security issues.
What You Will Find in This Book
This book is all about practice questions. The practice questions in the book,
some very easy and others a bit more difficult (perhaps with a little complicated
problem scenario, for example), are all aimed at raising your confidence level
before you take the real exam. In fact, you will even find questions that you will
face in real life.
This book is organized according to the objectives published by CompTIA for
the SY0-301: CompTIA Security+ (2011 Edition) exam (find the updated exam
information at http://certification.comptia.org/Training/testingcenters/exam-
objectives.aspx). Each chapter corresponds to an exam domain, and in every
chapter you will find the following three elements:
. Practice questions: These are the numerous questions that will help
you learn, drill, and review exam objectives. All the questions in this sec-
tion are multiple-choice type. Choose the correct answer based on your
knowledge of security.

6
. Quick-check answer key: After you have finished answering the ques-
tions, you can quickly grade your exam from this section. Only correct
answers are given in this section. No explanations are offered yet. Even if
you have answered a question incorrectly, do not be discouraged. Just
move on! Keep in mind that this is not the real exam. You can always
review the topic and do the questions again.
. Answers and explanations: This section provides you with correct
answers and further explanations about the content addressed in that
question. Use this information to learn why an answer is correct and to
reinforce the content in your mind for the exam day.
It is not possible to reflect a real exam on a paper product. As mentioned earlier, the pur-
pose of the book is to help you prepare for the exam, not to provide you with real exam
questions. Neither the author nor the publisher can guarantee that you will pass the exam
just by memorizing the practice questions in this book.
You will also find a Cram Sheet at the beginning of the book specifically written
for the exam day. The Cram Sheet contains core knowledge that you need for
the exam and is also found in the book CompTIA Security+ SYO-301 Exam Cram,
Third Edition (ISBN: 0789748290). The Cram Sheet condenses all the necessary
facts covered on the exam into an easy-to-handle tear card. It is something you
can carry with you to the testing center and use as a last-second study aid. Be
aware that you cannot take the Cram Sheet into the exam room, though.
Hints for Using This Book
Because this book is a practice product on paper, you might want to complete
your exams on a separate piece of paper so that you can reuse the exams with-
out having previous answers in your way. Also, a general rule across all practice
question products is to make sure that you are scoring well into the high 80%
to 90% range on all topics before attempting the real exam. The higher percent-
ages you score on practice question products, the better your chances for pass-
ing the real exam. Of course, we cannot guarantee a passing score on the real
exam, but we can offer you plenty of opportunities to practice and assess your
knowledge levels before you enter the real exam.

When you have completed the exam on paper, use the companion CD to take a
timed exam. Doing so will help build your confidence and help you determine
whether you need to study more. Your results will indicate the exam objectives
in which you need further study or hands-on practice.
Need Further Study?
Are you having a hard time correctly answering these questions? If so, you prob-
ably need further review of all exam objectives. Be sure to see the following sis-

Domain 1.0: Network
Security
The easiest way to keep a computer safe is by physically isolat-
ing it from outside contact. With the way organizations do
business today, this is virtually impossible. We have a global
economy and our networks are becoming increasingly more
complex. Domain 1 of the Security+ exam requires that you
are familiar with securing the devices on the network. To
secure devices, you must also understand the basic security
concepts of network design. Be sure to give yourself plenty of
time to review all these concepts. The following list identifies
the key areas from Domain 1.0 (which counts as 21% of the
exam) that you need to master:
. Explain the security function and purpose of network
devices and technologies
. Apply and implement secure network administration
principles
. Distinguish and differentiate network design elements
and compounds
. Implement and use common protocols
. Identify commonly used default network ports
. Implement wireless network in a secure manner

Answers and Explanations
Objective 1.1:Explain the security function
and purpose of network devices and 
technologies.
1. Answer: B, C, D. Intrusion detection systems are designed to analyze data, identify
attacks, and respond to the intrusion. Answer A is incorrect because preventing
attacks is associated with an intrusion prevention system.
2. Answer: B. IDSs are different from firewalls in that firewalls control the information
that gets in and out of the network, whereas IDSs can identify unauthorized activity.
IDSs are also designed to catch attacks in progress within the network, not just on the
boundary between private and public networks. Intrusion prevention differs from intru-
sion detection in that it actually prevents attacks instead of only detecting the occur-
rence of an attack. Based on this information, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
3. Answer: D. A HIDS collects and analyzes data that originates on the local machine.
Answer A is incorrect; a NIDS tries to locate packets not allowed on the network that
the firewall missed and looks at the information exchanged between machines. Answer
B is incorrect; intrusion prevention differs from intrusion detection in that it actually
prevents attacks in real-time instead of only detecting the occurrence. Answer C is
incorrect because firewalls control the information that gets in and out of the network.
4. Answer: A. A NIDS tries to locate packets not allowed on the network that the firewall
missed and looks at the information exchanged between machines. Answer B is incor-
rect; intrusion prevention differs from intrusion detection in that it actually prevents
attacks in real-time instead of only detecting the occurrence. Answer C is incorrect
because firewalls control the information that gets in and out of the network. Answer
D is incorrect; a HIDS collects and analyzes data that originates on the local machine.
5. Answer: B. Intrusion prevention differs from intrusion detection in that it actually pre-
vents attacks in real-time instead of only detecting the occurrence. Answer A is incor-
rect; a NIDS tries to locate packets not allowed on the network that the firewall missed
and looks at the information exchanged between machines. Answer C is incorrect
because firewalls control the information that gets in and out of the network. Answer
D is incorrect; a HIDS collects and analyzes data that originates on the local machine.
6. Answer: D. Network Load Balancers are servers configured in a cluster to provide
scalability and high availability. Load Balancing distributes IP traffic to multiple copies
of a TCP/IP service, such as a web server, each running on a host within the cluster.
Answer A is incorrect because virtual machine hosts are used to take advantage of
hardware advancements. Answer B is incorrect because a VPN concentrator is used to
allow multiple users to access network resources using secure features that are built
in to the device and are deployed where the requirement is for a single device to han-
dle a very large number of VPN tunnels. Answer C is incorrect because storage area
networks are used to make storage devices accessible to servers so that the devices
appear as locally attached.

Chapter 1
7. Answer: B, C. When implementing a NIPS, keep in mind that the sensors must be
physically inline to function properly. This adds single points of failure to the network.
Answer A is incorrect because sensors are not placed on domain controllers. Answer
D is incorrect because the sensors add single points of failure to the network, not
redundancy.
8. Answer: D. When implementing a NIPS, keep in mind that the sensors must be physi-
cally inline to function properly. This adds single points of failure to the network. A
good way to prevent this issue is to use fail-open technology. This means that if the
device fails, it does not cause a complete network outage; instead, it acts like a patch
cable. Answer A is incorrect because fail-open has nothing to do with application
redundancy. Answer B is incorrect; a NIPS fail-open has nothing to do with fire.
Answer C is incorrect because it does not cause a complete network outage; instead, 
it acts like a patch cable.
9. Answer: C. A firewall is a component placed on computers and networks to help 
eliminate undesired access by the outside world. It can be composed of hardware,
software, or a combination of both. Answer A is incorrect; a NIDS tries to locate pack-
ets not allowed on the network that the firewall missed and looks at the information
exchanged between machines. Answer B is incorrect because intrusion prevention 
prevents attacks in real-time instead of only detecting the occurrence. Answer D is
incorrect; a HIDS collects and analyzes data that originates on the local machine.
10. Answer: A. A VPN concentrator is used to allow multiple users to access network
resources using secure features that are built in to the device and are deployed where
the requirement is for a single device to handle a very large number of VPN tunnels.
Answer B is incorrect because Network Load Balancers are servers configured in a
cluster to provide scalability and high availability. Answer C is incorrect because virtual
machine hosts are used to take advantage of hardware advancements. Answer D is
incorrect because storage area networks are used to make storage devices accessible
to servers so that the devices appear as locally attached. 
11. Answer: B. A packet-filtering firewall is typically a router. Packets can be filtered based
on IP addresses, ports, or protocols. They operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of
the OSI model. Packet-filtering solutions are generally considered less-secure firewalls
because they still allow packets inside the network, regardless of communication pat-
tern within the session. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the function of a
stateful-inspection firewall. A stateful-inspection firewall is a combination of all types
of firewalls. This firewall relies on algorithms to process application layer data. Answer
C is incorrect; a circuit-level gateway operates at the OSI session layer (Layer 5) by
monitoring the TCP packet flow to determine whether the session requested is a l
egitimate one. Answer D is incorrect. With an application-level gateway, all traffic is
examined to check for OSI application layer (Layer 7) protocols that are allowed.
Examples of this type of traffic are File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

15. Answer: A, B, D. Proxy servers are used for security, logging, and caching. When the
proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, it passes through filtering
requirements and checks its local cache of previously downloaded web pages. Answer
C is incorrect. Addressing is a function of a DHCP server.
16. Answer: A, B. An exposed server that provides public access to a critical service, such
as a web or email server, may be configured to isolate it from an organization’s net-
work and to report attack attempts to the network administrator. Such an isolated
server is referred to as a bastion host, named for the isolated towers that were used to
provide castles advanced notice of pending assault. Answer C is incorrect. Database
servers are generally contained on the internal network. Answer D is incorrect. DHCP
servers give out IP addresses on the internal network.
17. Answer: B. When a proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, it passes
through filtering requirements and checks its local cache of previously downloaded
web pages. Because web pages are stored locally, response times for web pages are

faster, and traffic to the Internet is substantially reduced. Answer A is incorrect.
Internet content filters use a collection of terms, words, and phrases that are com-
pared to content from browsers and applications. This type of software can filter con-
tent from various types of Internet activity and applications, such as instant messag-
ing, email, and office documents. It can be used to monitor and stop the disclosure of
the organization’s proprietary or confidential information. Answer C is incorrect.
Protocol analyzers help you troubleshoot network issues by gathering packet-level
information across the network. These applications capture packets and decode the
information into readable data for analysis. Answer D is incorrect; a packet-filtering
firewall filters packets based on IP addresses, ports, or protocols and is a simple,
good first line of defense.
18. Answer: D. A packet-filtering firewall filters packets based on IP addresses, ports, or

server receives a request for an Internet service, it passes through filtering require-
ments and checks its local cache of previously downloaded web pages. Because web
pages are stored locally, response times for web pages are faster, and traffic to the
Internet is substantially reduced. Answer D is incorrect; a packet-filtering firewall fil-
ters packets based on IP addresses, ports, or protocols and is a simple, good first line
of defense.
21. Answer: A. Internet content filters use a collection of terms, words, and phrases that
are compared to content from browsers and applications. Because content filtering
uses screen captures of each violation with time-stamped data, it provides proper doc-
umentation for forensic investigations and litigation purposes. Answer B is incorrect.
When a proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, it passes through filter-
ing requirements and checks its local cache of previously downloaded web pages.
Because web pages are stored locally, response times for web pages are faster, and
traffic to the Internet is substantially reduced. Answer C is incorrect. Protocol analyz-
ers help you troubleshoot network issues by gathering packet-level information across
the network. These applications capture packets and decode the information into read-
able data for analysis. Answer D is incorrect; a packet-filtering firewall filters packets
based on IP addresses, ports, or protocols and is a simple, good first line of defense.
22. Answer: D. Content filtering is integrated at the operating system level so that it can
monitor events such as opening files via Windows Explorer. It can be used to monitor
and stop the disclosure of the organization’s proprietary or confidential information.
Based on the previous information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect because content
filtering is integrated at the operating system level.
23. Answer: C. Unlike antivirus and antispyware applications, content monitoring does not
require daily updates to keep the database effective and current. On the downside,
content filtering needs to be “trained.” For example, to filter nonpornographic material,
the terminology must be input and defined in the database. Answer A is incorrect
because content filtering helps control bandwidth costs. Answer B is incorrect based
on the previous stated information. Answer D is incorrect. Packet-filtering solutions
are generally considered less-secure firewalls because they still allow packets inside
the network, regardless of communication pattern within the session. This leaves the
system open to DoS attacks.
24. Answer: A, B. Protocol analyzers can do more than just look at packets. They prove
useful in many other areas of network management, such as monitoring the network
for unexpected, unwanted, and unnecessary traffic. For example, if the network is run-
ning slowly, a protocol analyzer can tell you whether necessary protocols are running
on the network. Answers C and D are incorrect; attack prevention is a function of an
intrusion prevention system, not a protocol analyzer.
25. Answer: B. Content filtering will report only on violations identified in the specified
applications listed for the filtering application. In other words, if the application will 
filter only Microsoft Office documents and a user chooses to use open Office, the 
content will not be filtered. Based on the preceding information, answers A, C, and D
are incorrect; content filtering will report only on violations identified in the specified
applications listed for the filtering application.

26. Answer: B. Like most other solutions, firewalls have strengths and weaknesses. 
By design, firewalls close off systems to scanning and entry by blocking ports or 
nontrusted services and applications. However, they require proper configuration.
Answers A and C are incorrect because they describe behaviors associated with
antivirus software. Answer D is incorrect because blocking off the system through
BIOS access would cause it to not boot.
27. Answer: A, B. A host intrusion detection system uses either misuse detection or
anomaly detection. A HIDS monitors events for suspicious activity. This can be 
done by using either misuse detection or anomaly detection. In misuse detection, 
a database of signatures is used, and the information monitored is compared to the
database. This is similar to the way antivirus software works. Answer C is incorrect
because blacklists are associated with email. Answer D is incorrect because outbound
monitoring is usually done by a firewall.
28. Answer: D. Monitoring outbound connections is important in the case of malware 
that “phones home.” Without this type of protection, the environment is not properly
protected. Answer A is incorrect because behaviors such as collecting personal infor-
mation or changing your computer configuration without appropriately obtaining prior
consent are associated with spyware. Answer B is incorrect because tracking users’
inappropriate site visits is associated with content filtering. Answer C is incorrect.
Monitoring bandwidth usage is a function of a network tool.
29. Answer: A, B. HIDSs monitor communications on a host-by-host basis and try to filter
malicious data. These types of IDSs are good at detecting unauthorized file modifica-
tions and user activity. NIDSs monitor the packet flow and try to locate packets that
may have gotten through misconfigured firewalls and are not allowed for one reason
or another. They are best at detecting DoS attacks and unauthorized user access.
Answers C and D are incorrect because they are associated with a NIDS.
30. Answer: D. NIDSs try to locate packets not allowed on the network. HIDSs collect and
analyze data that originate on the local machine or a computer hosting a service.
NIDSs tend to be more distributed. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they
describe features of a NIDS.
Objective 1.2: Apply and implement secure
network administration principles.
1. Answer: A, C. Port 110 is used for POP3 incoming mail and port 25 is used for SMTP
mail. Answer B is incorrect because port 21 is used for FTP. Port 443 is used by
HTTPS; therefore, answer D is incorrect.
2. Answer: A, B. UDP ports 161 and 162 are used by SNMP. Answer C is incorrect
because port 443 is used by HTTPS. Answer D is incorrect because port 4445 uses
TCP/UDP for service type upnotifyp.
3. Answer: B. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a small network between the internal net-
work and the Internet that provides a layer of security and privacy. Answer A is incor-
rect it describes a separate subnetwork. Answer C is incorrect because it describes an

intranet. An intranet is a portion of the internal network that uses web-based technolo-
gies. The information is stored on web servers and accessed using browsers. Answer
D is incorrect because it describes an extranet. An extranet is the public portion of the
company’s IT infrastructure that allows resources to be used by authorized partners
and resellers that have proper authorization and authentication. This type of arrange-
ment is commonly used for business-to-business relationships.
4. Answer: D. The purpose of a virtual local-area network (VLAN) is to unite network
nodes logically into the same broadcast domain regardless of their physical attach-
ment to the network. VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast traffic in a switched 
etwork. Answer A is incorrect because it describes NAT, which allows multiple 
computers to connect to the Internet using one IP address. Answer B is incorrect; a
switch is used to unite network nodes physically into the same broadcast domain.
Answer C is incorrect because subnetting splits one network into two or more, using
routers to connect each subnet.
5. Answer: A. NAT allows multiple computers to connect to the Internet using one IP
address. Answer B is incorrect; a switch is used to unite network nodes physically into
the same broadcast domain. Answer C is incorrect because subnetting splits one net-
work into two or more, using routers to connect each subnet. Answer D is incorrect
because the purpose of a virtual local-area network (VLAN) is to unite network nodes
logically into the same broadcast domain regardless of their physical attachment to
the network. VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast traffic in a switched network.
6. Answer: C. Subnetting splits one network into two or more, using routers to connect
each subnet. Answer A is incorrect. NAT allows multiple computers to connect to the
Internet using one IP address. Answer B is incorrect; a switch is used to unite network
nodes physically into the same broadcast domain. Answer D is incorrect because the
purpose of a virtual local-area network (VLAN) is to unite network nodes logically into
the same broadcast domain regardless of their physical attachment to the network.
VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast traffic in a switched network.
7. Answer: B. Network Address Translation (NAT) acts as a liaison between an internal
network and the Internet. It allows multiple computers to connect to the Internet using
one IP address. An important security aspect of NAT is that it hides the internal net-
work from the outside world. Answers A and C are incorrect because the purpose of a
virtual local-area network (VLAN) is to unite network nodes logically into the same
broadcast domain regardless of their physical attachment to the network. VLANs pro-
vide a way to limit broadcast traffic in a switched network. Answer D is incorrect; a
DMZ allows external users to access information that the organization deems neces-
sary.
8. Answer: D. Subnetting can be done for several reasons. If you have a Class C address
and 1,000 clients, you will have to subnet the network or use a custom subnet mask
to accommodate all the hosts. The most common reason networks are subnetted is to
control network traffic by limiting broadcast domains, which limits broadcast storms.
Answers A and C are incorrect because the purpose of a virtual local-area network
(VLAN) is to unite network nodes logically into the same broadcast domain regardless
of their physical attachment to the network. VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast
traffic in a switched network. Answer B is incorrect; an important security aspect of
NAT is that it hides the internal network from the outside world.

9. Answer: C. There are specific reserved private IP addresses for use on an internal 
network. In a Class C network, valid nonroutable host IDs are from 192.168.0.1 to
192.168.255.254. Network addresses with the first byte between 192 and 223 are
Class C and can have about 250 hosts. Answer A is incorrect because it is a Class A
address. Valid host IDs are from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254. Network addresses with
the first byte between 1 and 126 are Class A and can have about 17 million hosts
each. Answer B is incorrect because it is a Class B address; valid host IDs are from
172.16.0.1 through 172.31.255.254. Network addresses with the first byte between
128 and 191 are Class B and can have about 65,000 hosts each. Answer D is incorrect
because network addresses with the first byte between 224 and 239 are Class D and
are used for multicasting.
10. Answer: A. Another address range to keep in mind when designing IP address space
is Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). In the event that no Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is available at the time that the client issues a
DHCP lease request, the client is automatically configured with an address from the
169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254 range. Answer B is incorrect because if the
client has a corrupt routing table, it will not be able to reach the proper destination.
Answer C is incorrect because if the client has a manually configured address, it is not
usually in the 169.254.x.x address range. If the client cannot contact the DNS server,
the message displayed is “Cannot contact DNS server”; therefore, Answer D is incor-
rect.
11. Answer: B. In the event that no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is
available at the time the client issues a DHCP lease request, the client is automatically
configured with an address from the 169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254 range.
Answer A is incorrect because it is a Class C internal address. Answer C is incorrect
because it is a Class D address. Answer D is incorrect because it is a Class B internal
address.
12. Answer: D. One of the most effective ways to protect the network from malicious
hosts is to use network access control (NAC). NAC offers a method of enforcement
that helps ensure that computers are properly configured. The premise behind NAC is
to secure the environment by examining the user’s machine and, based on the results,
grant access accordingly. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the function of
NAT. Answer B is incorrect because it describes the function of subnetting. Answer C
is incorrect because it describes the function of a VLAN.
13. Answer: A, B, C. In a Class A network, valid nonroutable host IDs are from 10.0.0.1 to
10.255.255.254. In a Class B network, valid nonroutable host IDs are from 172.16.0.1
through 172.31.255.254. In a Class C network, valid nonroutable host IDs are from
192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254. Answer D is incorrect because network addresses
with the first byte between 224 and 239 are Class D and are reserved for multicasting.
14. Answer: A, C, D. The basic components of NAC products are the Access requestor
(AR), which is the device that requests access; the policy decision point (PDP), which
is the system that assigns a policy based on the assessment; and the policy enforce-
ment point (PEP), which is the device that enforces the policy. Answer B is incorrect.
The network redirector, or redirector, is an operating system driver that sends data to
and receives data from a remote device.

Domain 1.0: Network Security
55
15. Answer: B, C, D. The policy enforcement point is the device that enforces the policy.
This device may be a switch, firewall, or router. Answer A is incorrect; a hub cannot
enforce policy.
16. Answer: B. The four ways NAC systems can be integrated into the network are inline,
out-of-band, switch based, and host based. An out-of-band intervenes and performs
an assessment as hosts come online, and then grants appropriate access. Answer A is
incorrect. An appliance in the line usually sits between the access and the distribution
switches. Answer C is incorrect. Switch based is similar to in-band NAC except
enforcement occurs on the switch itself. Answer D is incorrect. Host based relies on
an installed host agent to assess and enforce access policy devices.
17. Answer: A, C, D. In addition to providing the capability to enforce security policy, con-
tain noncompliant users, and mitigate threats, NAC offers a number of business bene-
fits. The business benefits include compliance, a better security posture, and opera-
tional cost management. Answer B is incorrect. Separation of duties is one of the key
concepts of internal controls. It is not a business benefit. It is the most difficult and
sometimes the most costly one to achieve.
18. Answer: A, B. To protect your network, make sure the PBX is in a secure area, any
default passwords have been changed, and only authorized maintenance is done.
Many times, hackers can gain access to the phone system via social engineering
because this device is usually serviced through a remote maintenance port. Answers C
and D are incorrect because these are solutions associated with mitigating vulnerabili-
ties associated with VoIP.
19. Answer: D. Many times, hackers can gain access to the phone system via social engi-
neering because this device is usually serviced through a remote maintenance port. To
protect your network, make sure the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is in a secure
area, any default passwords have been changed, and only authorized maintenance is
done. Answer A is incorrect. Man-in-the-middle attacks are executed between the SIP
phone and a SIP proxy, allowing the audio to be manipulated, causing dropped,
rerouted, or playback calls. Answers B and C are incorrect; they are associated with
VoIP. VoIP PBX servers are susceptible to the same type of exploits as other network
servers. These attacks include DoS and buffer overflows, with DoS being the most
prevalent.
20. Answer: A, B, C. Man-in-the-middle attacks are executed between the SIP phone and
a SIP proxy, allowing the audio to be manipulated, causing dropped, rerouted, or play-
back calls. VoIP PBX servers are susceptible to the same type of exploits as other net-
work servers. These attacks include DoS and buffer overflows, with DoS being the
most prevalent. Answer D is incorrect. Many times, hackers can gain access to the
phone system via social engineering because this device is usually serviced through a
remote maintenance port.
21. Answer: C. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is commonly used in instant messaging,
but it can also be used as an alternative for VoIP. Using SIP can leave VoIP networks
open to unauthorized transport of data. Answer A is incorrect because long-distance
toll fraud is associated with a PBX. Answer B is incorrect; war-dialing attacks take
advantage of unsecure modems. Answer D is incorrect because war-driving attacks
take advantage of wireless networks.

Chapter 1
22. Answer: A. For years, PBX-type systems have been targeted by hackers, mainly to get
free long-distance service. The vulnerabilities that phone networks are subject to
include social engineering, long-distance toll fraud, and breach of data privacy. Answer
B is incorrect; war-dialing attacks take advantage of unsecure modems. Answer C is
incorrect. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is commonly used in instant messaging,
but it can also be used as an alternative for VoIP. Using SIP can leave VoIP networks
open to unauthorized transport of data. Answer D is incorrect. War-driving is used to
intercept wireless communications by driving around looking for unsecured wireless
networks.
23. Answer: B. Leaving modems open for incoming calls with little to no authentication
for users dialing in can be a clear security vulnerability in the network. For example,
war-dialing attacks take advantage of this situation. War-dialing is the process by
which an automated software application is used to dial numbers in a given range to
determine whether any of the numbers are serviced by modems that accept dial-in
requests. Answer A is incorrect because long-distance toll fraud is associated with a
PBX. Answer C is incorrect; using SIP can leave VoIP networks open to unauthorized
transport of data. Answer D is incorrect because war-driving attacks take advantage of
wireless networks.
24. Answer: A, C. Implementing the following solutions can help mitigate the risks and
vulnerabilities associated with VoIP: encryption, authentication, data validation, and
nonrepudiation. VoIP is basically based on a TCP/IP network; therefore, technologies
that are used to secure IP networks can be used for VoIP, too. Answer B is incorrect
because callback features are associated with the use of modems. Answer D is incor-
rect because encryption and firewall solutions are associated with the use of cable
modems.
25. Answer: B, D. Setting the callback features to have the modem call the user back at a
preset number and using encryption and firewall solutions will help keep the environ-
ment safe from attacks. Answers A and C are incorrect; implementing encryption,
authentication, data validation, and nonrepudiation can help mitigate the risks and vul-
nerabilities associated with VoIP.
26. Answer: A. The loop guard feature makes additional checks in Layer 2 switched net-
works. Answer B is incorrect because a flood guard is a firewall feature to control net-
work activity associated with denial of service attacks (DoS). Answer C is incorrect
because implicit deny is an access control practice wherein resource availability is
restricted to only those logons explicitly granted access. Answer D is incorrect
because port security is a Layer 2 traffic control feature on Cisco Catalyst switches. It
enables individual switch ports to be configured to allow only a specified number of
source MAC addresses coming in through the port.
27. Answer: B. A flood guard is a firewall feature to control network activity associated
with denial of service attacks (DoS). Answer A is incorrect because the loop guard fea-
ture makes additional checks in Layer 2 switched networks. Answer C is incorrect
because implicit deny is an access control practice wherein resource availability is
restricted to only those logons explicitly granted access. Answer D is incorrect
because port security is a Layer 2 traffic control feature on Cisco Catalyst switches. It

29. Answer: C. With interconnected networks, the potential for damage greatly increases
because one compromised system on one network can easily spread to other net-
works. Networks that are shared by partners, vendors, or departments should have
clear separation boundaries. Answer A is incorrect because  logging is the process of
collecting data to be used for monitoring and auditing purposes. Answer B is incorrect
because access control generally refers to the process of making resources available
to accounts that should have access, while limiting that access to only what is
required. Answer D is incorrect because VLANs are a logical separation of a physical
network.
30. Answer: D. VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast traffic in a switched network. This
creates a boundary and, in essence, creates multiple, isolated LANs on one switch.
VLANs are a logical separation of a physical network. Answer A is incorrect because
port security is a Layer 2 traffic control feature on Cisco Catalyst switches. It enables

31. Answer: B. Logging is the process of collecting data to be used for monitoring and
auditing purposes. Answer A is incorrect because it describes baselining. Answer C is
incorrect because it describes auditing. Answer D is incorrect because it describes
monitoring.
32. Answer: A. Logging procedures and evaluation are an important part of keeping your
network safe. However, before you can configure logging, it is essential to identify
what is typical behavior for your network. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect; all these
functions are performed after logging is enabled.
33. Answer: B. When choosing what to log, be sure you choose carefully. Logs take up
disk space and use system resources. They also have to be read, and if you log too
much, will bog down the system; it will take a long time to weed through the log files
to determine what is important. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
34. Answer: C, D. Standards should be implemented for the types of events you want to
log based on business, technical, and regulatory requirements, and the threats the
organization faces. Answer A is incorrect because although user needs should be 
considered, logging standards should not be based on them. Answer B is incorrect;
vendor requirements have nothing to do with organizational logging standards.

Objective 1.3: Distinguish and differentiate
network design elements and compounds. 
1. Answer: B, C. The main objective for the placement of firewalls is to allow only traffic
that the organization deems necessary and provide notification of suspicious behavior.
Answer A is incorrect because this is the function of a protocol analyzer. Answer D is
incorrect because Internet content filters monitor unauthorized transfer of confidential
information.
2. Answer: C. Most organizations deploy, at a minimum, two firewalls. The first firewall
is placed in front of the DMZ to allow requests destined for servers in the DMZ or to
route requests to an authentication proxy. The second firewall is placed to allow out-
bound requests. All initial necessary connections are located on the DMZ machines.
For example, a RADIUS server may be running in the DMZ for improved performance
and enhanced security, even though its database resides inside the company intranet.
Answer A is incorrect; the first firewall should be deployed in front of the DMZ, not
behind it. Answer B is incorrect; although the extranet would be located in the DMZ,
and the intranet is located on the internal network, it is between the DMZ and the
internal network where the firewall should be placed. Answer D is incorrect; although
you may have a firewall between the user data and financial data, if you are deploying
only two, the second one should go between the DMZ and the internal network.
3. Answer: A. A packet-filtering firewall is typically a router. Packets can be filtered based
on IP addresses, ports, or protocols. They operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of
the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Packet-filtering solutions are generally
considered less secure firewalls because they still allow packets inside the network,
regardless of communication patterns within the session. Answer B is incorrect; all
firewalls should be physically secure. Answer C is incorrect because secure passwords
for firewalls can easily be created. Answer D is incorrect because compromising a
secure router takes quite a bit of effort.
4. Answer: D. Proxy service firewalls are go-betweens for the network and the Internet.
They can be used to hide the internal addresses from the outside world through NAT.
This does not allow the computers on the network to directly access the Internet.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes the function of an intrusion detection sys-
tem. Answers B and C are incorrect because they describe functions associated with
an Internet content filtering system, not a proxy service firewall.
5. Answer: B. Proxy service firewalls are go-betweens for the network and the Internet.
They hide the internal addresses from the outside world and don’t allow the comput-
ers on the network to directly access the Internet. This type of firewall has a set of
rules that the packets must pass to get in or out. Because the firewall check traffic
against a set of rules, setting, policies, and guidelines are incorrect. Therefore,
answers A, C, and D are incorrect.

8. Answer: C, D. Because you want to monitor both types of traffic, the IDSs should be
used together. Network-based intrusion detection systems monitor the packet flow and
try to locate packets that are not allowed for one reason or another and may have got-
ten through the firewall. Host-based intrusion detection systems monitor communica-
tions on a host-by-host basis and try to filter malicious data. These types of IDSs are
good at detecting unauthorized file modifications and user activity. A firewall protects
computers and networks from undesired access by the outside world; therefore,
answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because Internet content filters use a col-
lection of terms, words, and phrases that are compared to content from browsers and
applications. Because content filtering uses screen captures of each violation with
time-stamped data, it provides proper documentation for forensic investigations and
litigation purpose.
9. Answer: B. Proxy servers can be placed between the private network and the Internet
for Internet connectivity. If the organization is using the proxy server for both Internet
connectivity and web content caching, the proxy server should be placed between the
internal network and the Internet, with access for users who are requesting the web
content. Answer A is incorrect; proxy servers are usually placed internally for web
content caching. Answer C is incorrect. A firewall is usually placed between a web
server and an internal file server. Answer D is incorrect. In some proxy server designs,
such as for a large organization, the proxy server is placed in parallel with IP routers.
This design allows for network load balancing by forwarding of all HTTP and FTP traf-
fic through the proxy server and all other IP traffic through the router.

server is placed in parallel with IP routers. This design allows for network load balanc-
ing by forwarding of all HTTP and FTP traffic through the proxy server and all other IP
traffic through the router. Answer A is incorrect; proxy servers are usually placed inter-
nally for web content caching. Answer C is incorrect. A firewall is usually placed

can be placed between the private network and the Internet for Internet connectivity. If
the organization is using the proxy server for both Internet connectivity and web con-
tent caching, the proxy server should be placed between the internal network and the
Internet, with access for users who are requesting the web content.
13. Answer: A. Internet content filtering works by analyzing data against a database con-
tained in the software. Content filtering reports only on violations identified in the
specified applications listed for the filtering application. In other words, if the applica-
tion will only filter Microsoft Office documents and a user chooses to use Open Office,
the content will not be filtered. Answers B and C are incorrect; they describe functions
associated with firewalls. Answer D is incorrect; analyzing traffic patterns is associated
with an intrusion detection systems.
14. Answer: A, C, D. Network Internet content filters can be hardware or software. Many
network solutions combine both. Hardware appliances are usually connected to the
same network segment as the users they will monitor. Other configurations include
being deployed behind a firewall or in a DMZ, with public addresses behind a packet-
filtering router. These appliances use access control filtering software on the dedicated
filtering appliance. The device monitors every packet of traffic that passes over a net-
work. Answer B is incorrect; network Internet content filters would not be placed on
the individual systems. If this were true, they would become host-based content fil-
ters.
15. Answer: C. In some proxy server designs, the proxy server is placed in parallel with IP
routers. This design allows for network load balancing by forwarding of all HTTP and
FTP traffic through the proxy server and all other IP traffic through the router. Answer
A is incorrect; proxy servers are usually placed internally for content caching not in
parallel with IP routers. Answer B is incorrect; proxy servers can be placed between
the private network and the Internet for Internet connectivity. Answer D is incorrect
because it describes Internet content filters. This type of software can filter content
from various types of Internet activity and applications, such as instant messaging,
email, and office documents. It can be used to monitor and stop the disclosure of the
organization’s proprietary or confidential information.

16. Answer: A, D. Protocol analyzers can be placed inline or in between the devices from
which you want to capture the traffic. If you are analyzing SAN traffic, the analyzer can
be placed outside the direct link with the use of an optical splitter. The analyzer is
placed to capture traffic between the host and the monitored device. Answers B and C
are incorrect because protocol analyzers are used to troubleshoot internal network
issues; therefore, they would not be placed outside the network.
17. Answer: C. A packet-filtering firewall is best suited for simple networks or used to
protect a network that is used mainly for Internet access. The placement of a packet-
filtering firewall is between the Internet and the protected network. It filters all traffic
entering or leaving the network. Answer A is incorrect because proxy service firewalls
allow organizations to offer services securely to Internet users. All servers hosting
public services are placed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) with the proxy firewall
between the DMZ and the internal network. Answer B is incorrect. Firewalls are not
usually placed in between servers on the internal network; VLANs are used to separate
resources. Answer D is incorrect because a stateful-inspection firewall is suited for
main perimeter security. Stateful-inspection firewalls can thwart port scanning by clos-
ing off ports until a connection to the specific port is requested.
18. Answer: B. When deploying multiple firewalls, you might experience network latency.
If you do, check the placement of the firewalls and possibly reconsider the topology to
be sure you get the most out of the firewalls. Answer A is incorrect. If the access lists
are configured correctly, legitimate traffic should not be blocked. This is true whether
you are using 1 firewall or 10 firewalls. Answer C is incorrect; using multiple firewalls
will reduce the attack vector, not increase it. Answer D is incorrect. Troubleshooting
should become less complex because each firewall is configured for the traffic it will
filter.
19. Answer: A. Proxy service firewalls allow organizations to offer services securely to
Internet users. All servers hosting public services are placed in the demilitarized zone
(DMZ) with the proxy firewall between the DMZ and the internal network. Answer B is

21. Answer: D. If attackers can compromise the virtual machines, they will likely have
control of the entire machine. Most virtual machines run with very high privileges on
the host because a virtual machine needs access to the host’s hardware so that it can
map the physical hardware into virtualized hardware. Answer A is incorrect because
although compromising the BIOS is possible, the inherent risk is to the other environ-
ments. Answer B is incorrect because physical access is usually required to change
the boot order. Answer C is incorrect because virtual environments can be secured.
22. Answer: A. Segmenting virtual machines by the information they handle will keep
highly sensitive data from being on the same physical hardware as virtual machines
used for testing or lower security applications. The organization should have a policy
in place that states that high-security virtual machines containing vital information
never share the same hardware as virtual machines for testing. Answers B and D are
incorrect because the environments the virtual machines will be shared with are less
secure. Answer C is incorrect because this defeats the purpose of using virtual envi-
ronments.
23. Answer: B, C. Virtual environments can be used to improve security by allowing
unstable applications to be used in an isolated environment and providing better dis-
aster recovery solutions. Virtual environments are used for cost-cutting measures, too.
One well-equipped server can host several virtual servers. This reduces the need for
power and equipment. Forensic analysts often use virtual environments to examine
environments that may contain malware or as a method of viewing the environment
the same way the criminal did. Answer A is incorrect because virtualized environ-
ments, if compromised, can provide access to not only the network, but also any vir-
tualization infrastructure. This puts a lot of data at risk. Answer D is incorrect because
the ability to store environments on USB devices puts data at risk.
24. Answer: B. The hypervisor controls how access to a computer’s processors and mem-
ory is shared. A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a virtualization plat-
form that provides more than one operating system to run on a host computer at the
same time. Answer A is incorrect. The BIOS holds information necessary to boot the
computer. Answer C is incorrect. The operating system interfaces between the hard-
ware and the user and provides an environment for programs and applications to run.
Answer D is incorrect because it is the hypervisor, not the virtual machine applica-
tions, that controls how the virtual environment uses the host resources.
25. Answer: A, D. Forensic analysts often use virtual environments to examine environ-
ments that may contain malware or as a method of viewing the environment the same
way the criminal did. Answer B is incorrect. It is not good forensic practice to load
multiple cases on one machine, virtual or real. Answer C is incorrect because imaging
hard drive and removable media should be done using a write-blocker to avoid data
alteration.
26. Answer: B. Virtualized environments, if compromised, can provide access to not only
the network, but also any virtualization infrastructure. This puts a lot of data at risk.
Security policy should address virtual environments. Answer A is incorrect. It is 
possible that other virtual machines have been compromised, too. Answers C and D
are incorrect because deleting the virtual machine or replacing it by a backup copy will
not guarantee that the rest of the machine or network has not been compromised.

Domain 1.0: Network Security

27. Answer: A, C. Vulnerabilities also come into play in virtual environments. For example,
a few years ago, VMware’s NAT service had a buffer-overflow vulnerability that allowed
remote attackers to execute malicious code by exploiting the virtual machine itself.
Virtual machine environments need to be patched just like host environments and are
susceptible to the same issues as a host operating system. You should be cognizant of
share files among guest and host operating systems. Answers B and D are incorrect
because virtual machines need to be patched just like host environments and are sus-
ceptible to the same issues as a host operating system, including malware infection.
28. Answer: C. Security policy should address virtual environment vulnerabilities. Any
technology software without a defined business need should not be allowed on sys-
tems. This applies to all systems, including virtual environments. Answer A is incor-
rect because change management policy deals with how environmental changes are
addressed. Answer B is incorrect because business continuity planning addresses how
a business will survive in the long term after a mishap. Answer D is incorrect because
disaster recovery planning deals with how the organization will react to a disaster.
29. Answer: C, D. Hardware vendors are rapidly embracing virtualization and developing
new features to simplify virtualization techniques. Virtual environments can be used to
improve security by allowing unstable applications to be used in an isolated environ-
ment and providing better disaster recovery solutions. Answer A is incorrect because
virtual environments do not scan for viruses. Answer B is incorrect virtual environ-
ments have nothing to do with reducing data aggregation. Data aggregation is used to
gather statistics about user habits mostly for online advertising purposes.
30. Answer: C. With more emphasis being placed on going green and power becoming
more expensive, virtualization offers cost benefits by decreasing the number of physi-
cal machines required within an environment; however, the security of the VMs must
be considered. Segmenting virtual machines by the information they handle will keep
highly sensitive data from being on the same physical hardware as virtual machines
used for testing or lower security applications. The organization should have a policy
in place that states that high-security virtual machines containing vital information
never share the same hardware as virtual machines for testing. Answer A is incorrect
because although replacing the servers may reduce the power consumption, it will be
costly. Answer B is incorrect. Combining all physical hardware into one virtual server
might not even be possible, and there is no guarantee this will not create additional
issues. Answer D is incorrect because it does not take the security of the data into
consideration.
31. Answer: A, B, C, D. Virtual environments are available to run on just about everything
from servers and routers to USB thumb drives.
32. Answer: D. A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a virtualization platform
that provides more than one operating system to run on a host computer at the same
time. Answers A and C are incorrect because hypervisors do not interact with the OS
kernel. Answer B is incorrect. This describes a mainframe environment.
33. Answer: B. The security concerns of virtual environments begin with the guest operat-
ing system. If a virtual machine is compromised, an intruder can gain control of all the
guest operating systems. In addition, because hardware is shared, most virtual
machines run with very high privileges. This can allow an intruder who compromises a

64
Chapter 1
virtual machine to compromise the host machine, too. Answer A is incorrect because
the underlying hardware security will be affected only if the guest operating system is
compromised. Answer C is incorrect. Although the host operating system needs to be
secure, the immediate concerns are with the guest operating system. Answer D is
incorrect. The virtual machine files are what make up the virtual machine and are part
of the way the environment loads.
34. Answer: C. The security concerns of virtual environments begin with the guest operat-
ing system. If a virtual machine is compromised, an intruder can gain control of all the
guest operating systems. In addition, because hardware is shared, most virtual
machines run with very high privileges. This can allow an intruder who compromises a
virtual machine to compromise the host machine, too. Answer A is incorrect because
although compromising the BIOS is possible, the unintended risk is the high privileges
needed to run the virtual environment. Answer B is incorrect because disaster recov-
ery is easier using virtual machines. Answer D is incorrect because although technolo-
gy advances quite rapidly, virtual environments can be secured.
35. Answer: D. To secure a virtualized environment, machines should be segmented by
the sensitivity of the information they contain. A policy should be in place that speci-
fies that hardware is not shared for test environments and sensitive data. Answer A is
incorrect because although encryption is a viable solution, it might not be possible and
is not always the correct solution for an organization. Answer B is incorrect. Although
the host operating system needs to be secure, the immediate concerns are with the
guest operating systems. Answer C is incorrect because high-security virtual machines
containing vital information should never share the same hardware as virtual machines
for testing.
36. Answer: C. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is the delivery of a computing platform,
often an operating system with associated services, that is delivered over the Internet
without downloads or installation. Answer A is incorrect. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
is the delivery of a licensed application to customers over the Internet for use as a
service on demand. Answer B is incorrect because Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
is the delivery of computer infrastructure in a hosted service model over the Internet.
Answer D is incorrect because Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), also called virtual desk-
top or hosted desktop services, is the outsourcing of a virtual desktop infrastructure
(VDI) to a third-party service provider.
37. Answer: A. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the delivery of a licensed application to

Objective 1.6: Implement wireless network
in a secure manner.
1. Answer: B. The WPA2 standard implements the 802.11i-2004 protocols and is cur-
rently the highest standard for Wi-Fi communication security. Answer A is incorrect
because a WAP refers to both handheld devices as well as wireless access points.
Answer C is incorrect because WEP2 is a stopgap enhancement to WEP present in
some of the early 802.11i drafts. Answer D is incorrect because the WEP standard was
proven to be unsecure and has been replaced by the newer WPA standards.
2. Answer: C. When a client attempts to make an 802.1x-compliant connection, the client
attempts to contact a wireless access point (AP). The AP authenticates the client
through a basic challenge-response method, and then provides connectivity to a wired
network or serves as a bridge to a secondary wireless AP. Answers A and D are incor-
rect because there is no user interaction in the authentication process. Answer B is
incorrect because a hardware token is a security token that is used in multifactor
authentication. It has nothing to do with how a client authenticates to a WAP.
3. Answer: A. New standards that involve time-changing encryption keys , such as the
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2) stan-
dard may help with weak key encryption. Answer B is incorrect. Persons wanting to
“sniff” the data transmitted over the wireless network may use many solutions to
increase the distance over which detection is possible, including the use of reflective
tube waveguides (such as the popular Pringle’s can) and flying devices overhead to
increase detection range without interference from building structures. Answer C is
incorrect. Mobile devices equipped for Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity,
such as laptops, cell phones, and PDAs, are subject to receiving text and message

72
Chapter 1
broadcast spam sent from a nearby Bluetooth-enabled transmitting device in an attack
referred to as bluejacking. D is incorrect because a popular pastime involves driving
around with a laptop system configured to listen for open 802.1x access points
announcing their SSID broadcasts, which is known as war-driving.
4. Answer: D. WEP is the most basic form of encryption that can be used on 802.11-
based wireless networks to provide privacy of data sent between a wireless client 
and its access point. Answer A is incorrect. Wireless Application Environment (WAE)
specifies the framework used to develop applications for mobile devices, including cell
phones, data pagers, and PDAs. Answers B and C are incorrect. Wireless Session
Layer (WSL), Wireless Transport Layer (WTL), and Wireless Transport Layer Security
(WTLS) are the specifications that are included in the WAP standard.
5. Answer: D. The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and later WPA2) standards were devel-
oped by the Wi-Fi Alliance to replace the WEP protocol while the 802.11i standard was
being developed. The WPA includes many of the functions of the 802.11i protocol but
relies on the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4), which is considered vulnerable to keystream
attacks. The later WPA2 standard was certified to include the full 802.11i standard
after its final approval. Answers A and C are incorrect because they are encryptions
standards not associated with the Wi-Fi Alliance. Answer B is incorrect because a WAP
refers to both handheld devices as well as wireless access points.
6. Answer: A, C. The IEEE and IETF specify 802.1X and EAP as the standard for secure
wireless networking, and Protected EAP (PEAP) is standards based. PEAP provides
mutual authentication and uses a certificate for server authentication by the client,
while users have the convenience of entering password-based credentials. Answer B is
incorrect because LEAP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol. Answer D is incorrect because
WEP is the most basic form of encryption that can be used on 802.11-based wireless
networks to provide privacy of data sent between a wireless client and its access
point.
7. Answer: D. CCMP uses 128-bit keys, with a 48-bit initialization vector (IV) that
reduces vulnerability to replay attacks. Answer A is incorrect because ICMP is a net-
work troubleshooting protocol. Answer B is incorrect because WEP is the most basic
form of encryption that can be used on 802.11-based wireless networks. Answer C is
incorrect because WPA protects networks by incorporating a set of enhanced security
features. WPA-protected networks require users to enter a passkey to access a wire-
less network.
8. Answer: C. LEAP combines centralized two-way authentication with dynamically gen-
erated wireless equivalent privacy keys, or WEP keys. Answer A is incorrect because
EAP is a challenge response protocol that can be run over secured transport mecha-
nisms. Answer B is incorrect because PEAP provides mutual authentication and uses a
certificate for server authentication by the client. Answer D is incorrect because WEP
is the most basic form of encryption that can be used on 802.11-based wireless net-
works to provide privacy of data sent between a wireless client and its access point.
9. Answer: B. An antenna that is too strong raises security concerns. Strong omnidirec-
tional Wi-Fi signals are radiated to a greater distance into neighboring areas where the
signals can be readily detected and viewed. Minimizing transmission power reduces

the changes your data will leak out. Answer A is incorrect because antenna placement
should not be used as a security mechanism. Answer C is incorrect because SSID
broadcast using the default SSIDs poses a security risk even if the AP is not broad-
casting it. Answer D is incorrect because MAC filtering permits and denies network
access through the use of blacklists and white lists.
10. Answer: D. MAC filtering permits and denies network access through the use of black-
lists and white lists. Answer A is incorrect because antenna placement should not be
used as a security mechanism. Answer B is incorrect because an antenna that is too
strong raises security concerns. Strong omnidirectional Wi-Fi signals are radiated to a
greater distance into neighboring areas where the signals can be readily detected and
viewed. Answer C is incorrect because SSID broadcast using the default SSIDs poses
a security risk even if the AP is not broadcasting it.
11. Answer: A, B, D. Wireless networks often announce their service set identifier (SSID)
to allow mobile devices to discover available WAPs. Turning off this broadcast can
reduce the vulnerability of a broadcast packet sniffer readily identifying a WAP, but is
not truly secure because the SSID is broadcast in plain text whenever a client connects
to the network. Turning off SSID broadcast should be considered a “best practice,”
along with conducting the site survey, selecting channels not already in use in the
area, requiring WPA2 (or newer) encryption, and restricting access to a known list of
Wi-Fi MAC addresses where possible. Answer C is incorrect because turning on DHCP
will allow a rogue client to automatically connect. Therefore, it increases the vulnera-
bility.
12. Answer: A. Wireless networks often announce their service set identifier (SSID) to
allow mobile devices to discover available WAPs. Turning off this broadcast can
reduce the vulnerability of a broadcast packet sniffer readily identifying a WAP, but is
not truly secure because the SSID is broadcast in plain text whenever a client connects
to the network. Answer B is incorrect. Privilege escalation is a vulnerability represent-
ed by the accidental or intentional access to resources not intended for access by the
user. Application flaws can allow a normal user access to administrative functions
reserved for privileged accounts, or to access features of an application reserved for
other users. Answer C is incorrect. Back doors represent application code functions
created intentionally or unintentionally, which allow unauthorized access to networked
resources. Answer D is incorrect because automated and social-engineering assaults
on passwords are easier when a password is short, lacking in complexity, derived
from a common word found in the dictionary, or derived from easily guessable per-
sonal information such as birthdays, family names, pet names, and similar details.
13. Answer: A. In general, a MAC address added to the approved list is never denied
access. This is also known as a white list. Answer B is incorrect. A MAC address
added to the blocked list is always denied access. This is also known as a blacklist.
Blacklisting is blocking a MAC address. Answer C is incorrect. Graylisting is related to
white listing and blacklisting of email. What happens is that each time a given mailbox
receives an email from an unknown contact (IP), that mail is rejected with a “try again
later.” Answer D is incorrect because brownlisting is a concept based on a CBL type
system driven by tokens from blocked sites.

while users have the convenience of entering password-based credentials. Answer B is

802.11-based wireless networks to provide privacy of data sent between a wireless
client and its access point. Answer C is incorrect because LEAP is a Cisco-proprietary
protocol.
15. Answer: C. To provide for replay protection, a packet number (PN) field is used. CCMP
produces a message integrity code (MIC) that provides data origin authentication and
data integrity for the packet payload data. Answer A is incorrect because WPA protects
networks by incorporating a set of enhanced security features. WPA-protected net-
works require users to enter a passkey to access a wireless network. Answer B is
incorrect because WEP is the most basic form of encryption that can be used on
802.11-based wireless networks. Answer D is incorrect because ICMP is a network

Answers and Explanations
Objective 2.1: Explain risk related concepts.
1. Answer: D. To ensure that proper incident response planning is managed and main-
tained, it is important to establish clear and detailed security policies that are ratified
by an organization’s management and brought to the attention of its users. Current
and pending legislation will affect the formulation of those policies. Answers A, B, and
C are incorrect; although each of these factors may have influence on organizational
policies, legislation will have the greatest effect.
2. Answer: B. An acceptable use policy provides details that specify what users may do
with their network access, including email and instant messaging usage for personal
purposes, limitations on access times, and the storage space available to each user.
Answer A is incorrect because an organization’s information sensitivity policy will
define requirements for the classification and security of data and hardware resources
based on their relative level of sensitivity. Answer C is incorrect because a change
management policy specifies details about system changes, such as the files being
replaced, the configuration being changed, and the machines or operating systems
affected. Answer D is incorrect because a computer security policy defines the goals
and elements of an organization’s computer systems.
3. Answer: B. An acceptable use policy example is that upon logon, a statement that 
network access is granted under certain conditions and that all activities may be 
monitored is displayed. Answer A is incorrect because an organization’s information
sensitivity policy will define requirements for the classification and security of data 
and hardware resources based on their relative level of sensitivity. Answer C is 
incorrect because a change management policy specifies details about system
changes, such as the files being replaced, the configuration being changed, and 
the machines or operating systems affected. Answer D is incorrect because a 
computer security policy defines the goals and elements of an organization’s 
computer systems.
4. Answer: D. The idea of separation of duties hinges on the concept that multiple people
conspiring to corrupt a system is less likely than a single person corrupting it. Answer
A is incorrect; due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and prudent
person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because due diligence refers
to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an agreement or a
transaction with another party. Answer C is incorrect; the principle of least privilege
refers to the concept that all users at all times should run with as few privileges as
possible.
5. Answer: B. Due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before
entering into an agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer A is incorrect;
due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and prudent person would
possess or act upon. Answer C is incorrect; due process is the concept that laws 
and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect; due course is an onward
movement in a particular direction.

6. Answer: A. Due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and prudent 
person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because due diligence refers
to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an agreement or a
transaction with another party. Answer C is incorrect; due process is the concept that
laws and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect; due course is an
onward movement in a particular direction.
7. Answer: C. Due process is the concept that laws and legal proceedings must be fair.
Answer A is incorrect; due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and
prudent person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because due 
diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an
agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer D is incorrect; due course is 
an onward movement in a particular direction.
8. Answer: B. Due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before
entering into an agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer A is incorrect;
due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and prudent person would
possess or act upon. Answer C is incorrect; due process is the concept that laws 
and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect; due course is an onward
movement in a particular direction.
9. Answer: A. Due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and prudent 
person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because due diligence refers
to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an agreement or a
transaction with another party. Answer C is incorrect because due process is the 
concept that laws and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect because
due course is an onward movement in a particular direction.
10. Answer: C. Due process is the concept that laws and legal proceedings must be fair.
Answer A is incorrect; due care is the knowledge and actions that a reasonable and
prudent person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because due 
diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an
agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer D is incorrect; due course is 
an onward movement in a particular direction.
11. Answer: D. The idea of separation of duties hinges on the concept that multiple people
conspiring to corrupt a system is less likely than a single person corrupting it. Often
you will find this in financial institutions, where in order to violate the security con-
trols, all the participants in the process would have to agree to compromise the 
system. Answer A is incorrect; due care is the knowledge and actions that a reason-
able and prudent person would possess or act upon. Answer B is incorrect because
due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into
an agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer C is incorrect; principle of
least privilege refers to the concept that all users at all times should run with as few
privileges as possible.
12. Answer: A. For security purposes, organizations should avoid having one individual
who has complete control of a transaction or process from beginning to end, and
implement policies such as job rotation, mandatory vacations, and cross-training.
Answer B is incorrect; security compliance deals with adhering to regulations and
standards. Answer C is incorrect; principle of least privilege refers to the concept that

Domain 2.0: Compliance and Operational Security
113
all users at all times should run with as few privileges as possible. Answer D is incor-
rect because due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before
entering into an agreement or a transaction with another party.
13. Answer: A, C, D. For security purposes, organizations should avoid having one 
individual who has complete control of a transaction or process from beginning to
end, and implement policies such as job rotation, mandatory vacations, and cross-
training. Answer B is incorrect because a change management policy specifies 
details about system changes such as the files being replaced, the configuration 
being changed, and the machines or operating systems affected.
14. Answer: A, B, C. Privacy-sensitive information is referred to as personally identifiable
information (PII). This is any information that identifies or can be used to identify,
contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. Examples of PII are
name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, Social
Security number, and credit card information. Answer D is incorrect because group
membership does not expose privacy-sensitive information.
15. Answer: B. Service level agreements establish the contracted requirements for service
through utilities, facility management, and ISPs. Answer A is incorrect; a business
impact analysis is an analytic process that aims to reveal business and operational
impacts stemming from any number of incidents or events. Answer C is incorrect
because a disaster recovery plan is a written document that defines how the organiza-
tion will recover from a disaster and how to restore business with minimum delay.
Answer D is incorrect because a disaster recovery policy outlines what to do during a
disaster.
16. Answer: B. Service level agreements establish the contracted requirements for service
through utilities, facility management, and ISPs. The purpose of an SLA is to establish
a cooperative partnership, bring both sides together, and map out each party’s respon-
sibilities. Answer A is incorrect; a business impact analysis is an analytic process 
that aims to reveal business and operational impacts stemming from any number of
incidents or events. Answer C is incorrect because a disaster recovery plan is a written
document that defines how the organization will recover from a disaster and how to
restore business with minimum delay. Answer D is incorrect because a disaster recov-
ery policy outlines what to do during a disaster.
17. Answer: C. When termination involves power users with high-level access rights or
knowledge of service administrator passwords, it is critical to institute password and
security updates to exclude known avenues of access while also increasing security
monitoring for possible reprisals against the organization. Answer A is incorrect;
immediately wiping the computer could delete necessary information. Answer B is
incorrect; although an exit interview is part of normal HR processes, the concern is
access after termination. Answer D is incorrect; searching the user’s work area should
be done by proper authority and procedures.
18. Answer: A. Hackers and other agents seeking unauthorized access often search for
highly placed users within an organization who have exempted themselves from stan-
dard security policies. Information about the profiles and positions of high-level users
is often available on organizational websites, which can provide hackers with more
directed information. Answers B and D are incorrect; these two groups should have a

114
Chapter 2
heightened sense of security awareness and not divulge confidential information.
Answer C is incorrect because users can provide valuable information, but high-level
employees have access to more valuable information.
19. Answer: A. It is important to locate a suitable upper-level sponsor for security initia-
tives to ensure that published security training and other requirements are applied to
all users equally. Without management buy-in, the program will have a difficult time
being successful. Based on this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
20. Answer: C. Metrics for security baselines and hardening efforts rely on identification
of vulnerability and risk. It is necessary to have some mechanism for measuring vul-
nerability to determine whether a baseline has been met, or if a new security measure
has been effective. Answer A is incorrect because mitigation of threats and attacks are
not related to metrics. Answer B is incorrect because security policies are not related
to metrics. Answer D is incorrect; mitigation of vulnerability and risk is not related to
metrics.
21. Answer: B. A risk, once identified, can be dealt with in several ways. A risk may be
transferred, such as when the risk of equipment loss is covered by a full-replacement
insurance policy. Answer A is incorrect because some risks cannot be addressed 
within a reasonable time, or are cost constrained, and may be accepted, with proper
documentation as to the reasons why the risk is acceptable. Answer C is incorrect
because some risks can be eliminated through a change in the technology, policy, or
mechanism of employment. For example, the risk of war-dialing attacks can be elimi-
nated by removing legacy dial-up telephony modem devices. Answer D is incorrect;
most risks fall into the mitigated response area, where the application of additional
effort may reduce the risk to a level documented as acceptable.
22. Answer: C. A risk, once identified, can be dealt with in several ways. Some risks can
be eliminated through a change in the technology, policy, or mechanism of employ-
ment. For example, the risk of war-dialing attacks can be eliminated by removing lega-
cy dial-up telephony modem devices. Answer A is incorrect because some risks can-
not be addressed within a reasonable time, or are cost constrained, and may be
accepted, with proper documentation as to the reasons why the risk is acceptable.

24. Answer: A. A risk, once identified, can be dealt with in several ways. Some risks 
cannot be addressed within a reasonable time, or are cost constrained, and may be
accepted, with proper documentation as to the reasons why the risk is acceptable.
Answer B is incorrect; a risk may be transferred, such as when the risk of equipment
loss is covered by a full-replacement insurance policy. Answer C is incorrect because
some risks can be eliminated through a change in the technology, policy, or mecha-
nism of employment. For example, the risk of war-dialing attacks can be eliminated by
removing legacy dial-up telephony modem devices. Answer D is incorrect; most risks
fall into the mitigated response area, where the application of additional effort may
reduce the risk to a level documented as acceptable.
25. Answer: D. Before any baseline can be established, beyond those developed by regu-
latory bodies outside of the business entity, a risk assessment must be conducted to
identify existing risks and potential mitigation mechanisms. Answer A is incorrect.
This is not a good policy and is not included as a risk assessment. Answer B is incor-
rect; it describes a vulnerability assessment. Answer C is incorrect; personally identifi-
able information may be part of the risk assessment, but is it not the main purpose.
26. Answer: A. Annual loss expectancy (ALE) equals the single loss expectancy (SLE)
times the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO): SLE × ARO = ALE. Based on the previ-
ous formula, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
27. Answer: B. SLE equals asset value multiplied by the threat exposure factor or proba-
bility. Answer A is incorrect because it describes return on investment (ROI). Answer
C is incorrect because it describes risk. Answer D is incorrect because it describes the
annualized rate of occurrence. The ARO is the estimated possibility of specific threat
taking place in a one-year time frame.
28. Answer: A. Risk management is the process of identifying and reducing risk to a level
that is comfortable, and then implementing controls to maintain that level. Answer B is
incorrect because some risks cannot be addressed within a reasonable time, or are
cost constrained, and may be accepted, with proper documentation as to the reasons
why the risk is acceptable. Answer C is incorrect because risk analysis helps align
security objectives with business objectives. Answer D is incorrect; a risk may be
transferred, such as when the risk of equipment loss is covered by a full-replacement
insurance policy because risk is the possibility of loss or danger.
29. Answer: C. Risk analysis helps align security objectives with business objectives. Risk
analysis identifies risks, estimates the impact of potential threats, and identifies ways
to reduce the risk without the cost of the prevention outweighing the risk. Answer A is
incorrect. Risk management is the process of identifying and reducing risk to a level
that is comfortable, and then implementing controls to maintain that level. Answer B is
incorrect because some risks cannot be addressed within a reasonable time, or are
cost constrained, and may be accepted, with proper documentation as to the reasons
why the risk is acceptable. Answer D is incorrect; a risk may be transferred, such as
when the risk of equipment loss is covered by a full-replacement insurance policy
because risk is the possibility of loss or danger.
30. Answer: C. Risk is the possibility of loss or danger. Answer A is incorrect because the
exposure factor or probability is the percentage of loss that a realized threat could
have on a certain asset. Answer B is incorrect; the cumulative loss expectancy (CLE) is

116
Chapter 2
a risk model that calculates risk based on single systems. Answer D is incorrect
because mitigation comes after risk is identified and assessed.
31. Answer: B. Because qualitative measures are based on subjective values, they are less
precise than quantitative measures. Answer A in incorrect because quantitative meas-
ures rely on numerical values rather than subjective ones. Answer C is incorrect
because qualitative measures are harder to assign numerical values and so more diffi-
cult to determine ROI. Answer D is incorrect because each form of analysis has its
own benefits and neither is always better in all situations than the other.
32. Answer: C. False positive is a control that allows unauthorized access, identifying the
access falsely as valid. Answer A is incorrect because a false negative is a control that
refuses authorized access, identifying the access falsely as invalid. Answer B is incor-
rect because technical controls include logical access control systems, security sys-
tems, encryption, and data classification solutions. Answer D is incorrect because
management or administrative controls include business and organizational processes
and procedures, such as security policies and procedures, personnel background
checks, security awareness training, and formal change management procedures.
33. Answer: A. A false negative is a control that refuses authorized access, identifying the
access falsely as invalid. Answer B is incorrect because technical controls include logi-
cal access control systems, security systems, encryption, and data classification solu-
tions. Answer C is incorrect because false positive is a control that allows unautho-
rized access, identifying the access falsely as valid. Answer D is incorrect because
management or administrative controls include business and organizational processes
and procedures, such as security policies and procedures, personnel background
checks, security awareness training, and formal change management procedures.
34. Answer: D. Management or administrative controls include business and organization-
al processes and procedures, such as security policies and procedures, personnel
background checks, security awareness training, and formal change management pro-
cedures. Answer A is incorrect because logical controls are the same as technical con-
trols. Answer B is incorrect because technical controls include logical access control
systems, security systems, encryption, and data classification solutions. Answer C is
incorrect because physical controls form the outer line of defense against direct
access to data, such as protection of backup media, securing output and mobile file
storage devices, and facility design details such as layout, doors, guards, locks, and
surveillance systems.
35. Answer: C. Physical controls form the outer line of defense against direct access to
data, such as protection of backup media, securing output and mobile file storage
devices, and facility design details such as layout, doors, guards, locks, and surveil-
lance systems. Answer A is incorrect because logical controls are the same as techni-
cal controls. Answer B is incorrect because technical controls include logical access
control systems, security systems, encryption, and data classification solutions.
Answer D is incorrect because management or administrative controls include 
business and organizational processes and procedures, such as security policies and
procedures, personnel background checks, security awareness training, and formal
change management procedures.

Objective 2.2: Carry out appropriate risk 
mitigation strategies.
1. Answer: A, B, D. During the process of risk assessment, it is necessary to review
many areas, such as the following: methods of access, authentication schemes, audit
policies, hiring and release procedures, isolated services that may provide a single
point of failure or avenue of compromise, and data or services requiring special back-
up or automatic failover support. Answer C is incorrect. Financial records review is not
a necessary part of risk assessment, but how well that data is protected may be.
2. Answer: D. Return on investment is the ratio of money realized or unrealized on an
investment relative to the amount of money invested. Answer A is incorrect because it
describes risk analysis. Answer B is incorrect because it describes risk management.
Answer C is incorrect because it describes return on capital.
3. Answer: B. Return on investment is equal to the loss prevented minus the cost of
solution. If the result of this formula is a negative number, you spent more than the
loss prevented. Therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answers C and D are incorrect
because depending on what the investment is, it may or may not be a good invest-
ment and might be necessary due to regulations.
4. Answer: C. The exposure factor or probability is the percentage of loss that a realized
threat could have on a certain asset. Answer A is incorrect because it describes vul-
nerability. Answer B is incorrect because it describes reduced risk on investment.
Answer D is incorrect because it describes annual rate of occurrence.
5. Answer: C. A change management policy specifies details about system changes,
such as the files being replaced, the configuration being changed, and the machines or
operating systems affected. Answer A is incorrect because an organization’s informa-
tion sensitivity policy will define requirements for the classification and security of
data and hardware resources based on their relative level of sensitivity. Answer B is
incorrect because an acceptable use policy provides details that specify what users
may do with their network access. Answer D is incorrect because a computer security
policy defines the goals and elements of an organization’s computer systems.
6. Answer: B. The Audit Use policy tracks potential resources at risk within your net-
working environment. These resources might typically include sensitive files, financial
applications, and personnel files. Answer A is incorrect because the privacy policy cov-
ers PII protection requirements and practices. Answer C is incorrect because change
management applies to network changes. Answer D is incorrect because it deals with
information storage and is not related to network access use.
7. Answer: C. Degaussing involves exposing the media to a powerful electromagnetic
device, erasing all magnetic variation within the media. Answer A is incorrect because
overwriting involves the sequential writing of 1s and 0s to mask previously stored data
and does not reduce all magnetic flux in the media to zero. Answer B is incorrect
because destruction involves physical destruction of the storage device rather than
only magnetic degaussing. Answer D is incorrect because declassification is a formal
process for assessing the risk involved with discarding information, rather than media
sanitization itself.

118
Chapter 2
8. Answer: A. When configuring an audit policy, it is important to monitor successful and
failed access attempts. Failure events allow you to identify unauthorized access
attempts; successful events can reveal an accidental or intentional escalation of access
rights. Answers B and C are incorrect because they will not provide you with a full 
picture of all access attempts. Answer D is incorrect because not auditing login
attempts can hinder any type of investigation.
9. Answer: B. Sanitization is the process whereby fully cleared media is extremely 
difficult if not impossible to restore. Answer A is incorrect because overwriting
involves the sequential writing of 1s and 0s to mask previously stored data and 
does not reduce all magnetic flux in the media to zero. Answer C is incorrect 
because destruction involves physical destruction of the storage device rather than
only magnetic degaussing. Answer D is incorrect because declassification is formal 
process for assessing the risk involved with discarding information, rather than 
media sanitization itself.
10. Answer: D. Incident response policies should include the identification of required
forensic and data-gathering procedures and proper reporting and recovery procedures
for each type of security-related incident. Answer A is incorrect because the privacy
policy covers PII protection requirements and practices. Answer B is incorrect because
audit policies track access to network resources. Answer C is incorrect because it
deals with information storage and is not related to network access use.
Objective 2.3: Execute appropriate incident
response procedures.
1. Answer: D. Computer forensics review involves the application of investigative and
analytical techniques to acquire and protect potential legal evidence. Answer A is
incorrect; due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before
entering into an agreement or a transaction with another party. Answer B is incorrect
because a chain of custody is the documentation of all transfers of evidence from one
person to another. Answer C is incorrect because due process is the concept that laws
and legal proceedings must be fair.
2. Answer: B. A chain of custody tells how the evidence made it from the crime scene 
to the courtroom, including documentation of how the evidence was collected, 
preserved, and analyzed. Answer A is incorrect; due diligence refers to the care a 
reasonable person should take before entering into an agreement or a transaction 
with another party. Answer C is incorrect because due process is the concept that 
laws and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect because computer
forensics review involves the application of investigative and analytical techniques 
to acquire and protect potential legal evidence.
3. Answer: A, C. The major concepts behind computer forensics are to identify the 
evidence, determine how to preserve the evidence, extract, process, and interpret the
evidence, and ensure that the evidence is acceptable in a court of law. Answers B 
and D are incorrect; identification and prosecution of the suspect are left to law
enforcement.

4. Answer: B. A chain of custody tells how the evidence made it from the crime scene 
to the courtroom, including documentation of how the evidence was collected, 
preserved, and analyzed. Answer A is incorrect; a disaster recovery plan is a written
document that defines how the organization will recover from a disaster and how to
restore business with minimum delay. Answer C is incorrect because due process is
the concept that laws and legal proceedings must be fair. Answer D is incorrect; due
diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into an
agreement or a transaction with another party.
5. Answer: D. The entire work area is a potential crime scene, not just the computer
itself. There might be evidence such as removable media, voicemail messages, or
handwritten notes. The work area should be secured and protected to maintain the
integrity of the area. Under no circumstances should you touch the computer or
should anyone be allowed to remove any items from the scene. Based on this 
information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
6. Answer: A. If you are an untrained first responder, touch nothing and contact some-
one trained in these matters for help. Although it seems that simply viewing the files
or directories on a system would not change the original media, merely browsing a file
can change it. Based on this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
7. Answer: C. When the response team has determined that an incident occurred, the
next step in incident analysis involves taking a comprehensive look at the incident
activity to determine the scope, priority, and threat of the incident. Answer A is incor-
rect; the press should not be contacted unless it is absolutely necessary, and then only
after the scope has been determined. Answer B is incorrect because affected vendors
should be contacted only after the scope has been determined. Answer D is incorrect
because the risk cannot be mitigated until the scope is determined.
8. Answer: B. In keeping with the severity of the incident, the organization can act to mit-
igate the impact of the incident by containing it and eventually restoring operations
back to normal. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect; analysis, remediation, and report-
ing happen after containment.
9. Answer: C. Request For Comments (RFC) 2350, “Expectations for Computer Security
Incident Response,” spells out the expectations for computer security incident
response. This RFC can be helpful in formulating organizational best practices for
reporting and disclosure. Answer A is incorrect; organizational best practices for
reporting and disclosure are not found in operating system manuals. Answer B is
incorrect; FBI Investigative Guidelines are the guidelines on general crimes, national
security investigative guidelines, and the confidential supplemental foreign intelligence
guidelines. Answer D is incorrect because RFC 50 is comments on the Meyer
Proposal.
10. Answer: B. It is important to accurately determine the cause of each incident so that it
can be fully contained and the exploited vulnerabilities can be mitigated to prevent
similar incidents from occurring in the future. Answer A is incorrect; the incident
response plan would be updated, not the disaster recovery plan. Answer C is incorrect;
apprehension and prosecution is the job of law enforcement. Answer D is incorrect;
depending on the incident, press and vendor notification may not be necessary.

Objective 2.4: Explain the importance of
security related awareness and training.
1. Answer: D. For best protection, proper security technologies and techniques must be
deployed at the client side, the server side, and the enterprise level. Ideally, users
should not be able to directly access email attachments from within the email applica-
tion. However, the best defense is user education. Answer A is incorrect; S/MIME is a
standard for public key encryption and signing of email. Answer B is incorrect because
antivirus software cannot identify phishing scams. Answer C is incorrect because
email filtering cannot catch all unwanted email.
2. Answer: C. Equipment sometimes is put in the garbage because city laws do not
require special disposal. Because intruders know this, they can scavenge through dis-
carded equipment and documents, called dumpster diving, and extract sensitive infor-
mation from it without ever contacting anyone in the company. Answer A is incorrect;
health hazards are a concern; however, the real danger is the organizational informa-
tion that is readily accessible. Answer B is incorrect; social engineering is a process by
which an attacker may extract useful information from users who are often tricked into
helping the attacker. Answer D is incorrect because shoulder surfing uses direct
observation techniques. It gets its name from looking over someone’s shoulder to get
information.
3. Answer: C. Equipment sometimes is put in the garbage because city laws do not
require special disposal. Because intruders know this, they can scavenge through dis-
carded equipment and documents, called dumpster diving, and extract sensitive infor-
mation from it without ever contacting anyone in the company. Answer A is incorrect;
fire hazards are a concern. However, the real danger is the organizational information
that is readily accessible. Answer B is incorrect because social engineering is a
process by which an attacker may extract useful information from users who are often
tricked into helping the attacker. Answer D is incorrect because shoulder surfing uses
direct observation techniques. It gets its name from looking over someone’s shoulder
to get information.
4. Answer: B. The immediate solution to prevent shoulder surfing is to shield paperwork
or your keypad from view by using your body or cupping your hand. Biometrics and
gaze-based password entry makes gleaning password information difficult for the
unaided observer while retaining the simplicity and ease of use for the user. Answer A
is incorrect because it is an immediate solution, not the best defense. Answer C is
incorrect because security guards won’t necessarily prevent shoulder surfing. Answer
D is incorrect because switching to deadbolts is not a viable solution.
5. Answer: A. Reverse social engineering involves an attacker convincing the user that he
is a legitimate IT authority, causing the user to solicit his assistance. Answer B is
incorrect because denial of service is a type of network attack. Answer C is incorrect
because shoulder surfing uses direct observation techniques. It gets its name from
looking over someone’s shoulder to get information. Answer D is incorrect because
phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trust-
worthy entity via an electronic communication, usually email.

6. Answer: B. A clean desk policy provides guidance for data sanitization of the work
environment.  Answer A is incorrect because the data handling training would be
focused on how to manage data stored on organizational systems rather than personal
ones. Answer C is incorrect because situational awareness training involves develop-
ing strategies and skills for dealing with physical access violations and similar events
rather than addressing which personal technologies are appropriate and how they
should be used properly. Answer D is incorrect because personal technology training
covers social networks, peer-to-peer networking, and mobile technologies owned by
the employees but present in the workplace.
7. Answer: A, B. Social engineering attacks involve tricking a user into providing the
attacker with access rights or operational details. Answer C is incorrect because pack-
et sniffing is a form of a network security threat. Answer D is incorrect because this is
a physical access control risk rather than social engineering.
8. Answer: C. Management training should focus on the ramifications of social engineer-
ing, such as the liability of the company when a breach happens, the financial damage
that can happen, and how this can affect the reputation or credibility of the company.
Answer A is incorrect because the user-based training will be more prevention orient-
ed. Answer B is incorrect because to focus the training on costs rather than benefits is
not promoting education. Answer D is incorrect because this training will be technical.
9. Answer: B, C, D. Planning, training, regular reminders, and firm and clear security
policies are important when you’re attempting to minimize vulnerabilities created by
social engineering. Answer A is incorrect; security posters might be a part of training,
but are not an essential element.
10. Answer: A, D. Some guidelines for information to be included in user training may
consist of the following points: how to address someone who has her hands full and
asks for help getting into a secure area, how to react to someone who has piggy-
backed into the building, what to say to a vice president who has forgotten his pass-
word and needs it right away, and what to do when an administrator calls and asks for
a user’s password. Answer B is incorrect; this is a part of fire safety education. Answer
C is incorrect; virus education should be addressed separately from security aware-
ness training.
11. Answer: D. ISO 17799, particularly sections 7 and 8, has established standards for
dealing with the proper disposal of obsolete hardware. Answer A is incorrect;
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) governs financial and accounting disclosure information.
Answer B is incorrect; ISO 9000 is a family of standards for quality management sys-
tems. Answer C is incorrect; the IEEE specifications are the central source for stan-
dardization in a broad range of emerging technologies.
12. Answer: A, B, D. Breaches of health and safety requirements, inadequate disposal
planning results in severe business loss, remnants of legacy data from old systems
that may still be accessible, and disposal of old equipment that is necessary to read
archived data should be considered when formulating a policy on the secure disposal
of outdated equipment. Answer C is incorrect because it is addressing a cost, not a
disposal consideration.

Chapter 2
13. Answer: B. Sanitization is the process of removing the contents from the media as
fully as possible, making it extremely difficult to restore. Answer A is incorrect
because declassification is a formal process of assessing the risk involved in discard-
ing particular information. Answer C is incorrect because degaussing is a method that
uses an electrical device to reduce the magnetic flux density of the storage media to
zero. Answer D is incorrect because destruction is the process of physically destroying
the media and the information stored on it.
14. Answer: A. Strong password policies help protect the network from hackers and
define the responsibilities of users who have been given access to company
resources. Answer B is incorrect; if the passwords are too difficult to remember, users
will write them down and post them on monitors, keyboards, and any number of easy-
to-find places. Answer C is incorrect because enabling Store Passwords Using
Reversible Encryption is essentially the same as storing passwords in plaintext, which
is unsecure and not recommended. The purpose of this policy setting is to provide
support for applications that use protocols that require knowledge of the user’s pass-
word for authentication purposes. Answer D is incorrect because default passwords
can easily be guessed by an intruder.
15. Answer: C. After the change has been requested, documented, and approved, you
should then send out notification to the users so that they will know what to expect
when the change has been implemented. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect; notification
happens before implementation. Answer B is incorrect; often management doesn’t
need notification. Answer D is incorrect; after changes are approved, there should not
be workarounds.
16. Answer: C. Personal technologies training should cover social networks, peer-to-peer
networking, and mobile technologies owned by the employees but present in the
workplace. Answer A is incorrect because the clean desk policy provides guidance for
data sanitization of the work environment. Answer B is incorrect because the data han-
dling training would be focused on how to manage data stored on organizational sys-
tems rather than personal ones. Answer D is incorrect because situational awareness
training involves developing strategies and skills for dealing with physical security
threats.
17. Answer: B. Proprietary classification is internal information that defines the way in
which the organization operates. Security should be high. Answer A is incorrect
because top-secret classification is highly sensitive internal documents and data. This
is the highest security level possible. Answer C is incorrect because internal use only
classification is information that is unlikely to result in financial loss or serious dam-
age to the organization. This is a restricted but normal security level. Answer D is
incorrect because public documents classification is information in the public domain.
This is a minimal security level.
18. Answer: A. Top-secret classification is highly sensitive internal documents and data.
This is the highest security level possible. Answer B is incorrect because proprietary
classification is internal information that defines the way in which the organization
operates. Security should be high. Answer C is incorrect because internal use only
classification is information that is unlikely to result in financial loss or serious dam-
age to the organization. This is a restricted but normal security level. Answer D is

123
incorrect because public documents classification is information in the public domain.
This is a minimal security level.
19. Answer: C. Internal use only classification is information that is unlikely to result in
financial loss or serious damage to the organization. This is a restricted but normal
security level. Answer A is incorrect because top-secret classification is for highly sen-
sitive internal documents and data. This is the highest security level possible. Answer
B is incorrect because proprietary classification is internal information that defines the
way in which the organization operates. Security should be high. Answer D is incorrect
because public documents classification is information in the public domain. This is a
minimal security level.
20. Answer: B. Training should include details of the organization’s clean desk policy,
encouraging users to avoid jotting down hard-to-recall passphrases, details from 
electronic systems that may contain PII, or why taping a list of their logons and 
passwords under their keyboard is a bad idea. Answer A is incorrect because an orga-
nization’s information sensitivity policy will define requirements for the classification
and security of data and hardware resources based on their relative level of sensitivity.
Answer C is incorrect because a change management policy specifies details about
system changes, such as the files being replaced, the configuration being changed,
and the machines or operating systems affected. Answer D is incorrect; a computer
security policy defines the goals for securing and protecting an organization’s comput-
er systems.
Objective 2.5: Compare and contrast aspects
of business continuity. 
1. Answer: D. Business continuity planning is a more comprehensive approach to pro-
viding guidance so the organization can continue making sales and collecting revenue.
As with disaster recovery planning, it covers natural and man-made disasters. Based
on this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
2. Answer: C. A disaster recovery plan is a written document that defines how the organ-
ization will recover from a disaster and how to restore business with minimum delay.
Answer A is incorrect because an impact analysis is an analytic process that aims to
reveal business and operational impacts stemming from any number of incidents or
events. Answer B is incorrect because business continuity planning is a comprehen-
sive approach to providing guidance so that the organization can continue making
sales and collecting revenue. Answer D is incorrect because a risk analysis helps
determine which security controls are appropriate and cost effective.
3. Answer: A, D. Restoration planning documentation, backup scheduling, and backup
media must include protections against unauthorized access or potential damage and
critical procedures should be properly documented so that another equally trained
individual can manage the restoration process. Answer B is incorrect; although this is
convenient, it is not secure. Answer C is incorrect because this information does not
belong in the employee manual.

Chapter 2
4. Answer: B. A common practice is to have removable storage media locked in a proper
safe or container at the end of the day. Answer A is incorrect; although this is conven-
ient, it is not secure. Answer C is incorrect because this information does not belong
in the desk of the HR manager. Answer D is incorrect because storing backup tapes in
the home of the IT manager is a liability for the organization.
5. Answer: A, C. Business continuity planning should identify required services, such as
network access and utility agreements, and arrange for automatic failover of critical
services to redundant offsite systems. Answers B and D are incorrect because they are
part of disaster recovery planning.
6. Answer: A. Clear lines of succession and cross-training in critical functions are critical
to meeting recovery time (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPOs), together with
communications plans for alternative mechanisms of contact to alert individuals as to
the need for succession. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the
main purpose of recovery point objectives.
7. Answer: B, C, D. To determine the number of single points of failure in the organiza-
tion, start with a good map of everything the organization uses to operate. Pay special
attention to items such as the Internet connection, routers, switches, and proprietary
business equipment. Answer A is incorrect because local desktop connections are not
a single point of failure.
8. Answer: C. The BIA is not focused as much on the relative likelihood of potential
threats to an organization but instead focuses on the relative impact on critical busi-
ness functions due to the loss of operational capability due to the threats. Answer A is
incorrect because identifying required business services is part of business continuity
planning. Answers B and D are incorrect because they are part of disaster recovery
planning.
9. Answer: A. Another way to increase availability is server clustering. A server cluster is
the combination of two or more servers so that they appear as one. This clustering
increases availability by ensuring that if a server is out of commission because of 
failure or planned downtime, another server in the cluster takes over the workload.
Answers B, C, and D all deal with hard disks and will not provide availability if the 
system board dies.
10. Answer: D. A system restoration plan should include procedures on what to do if a
disgruntled employee changes an administrative password before leaving. Answer A 
is incorrect because an impact analysis is an analytic process that aims to reveal 
business and operational impacts stemming from any number of incidents or events.
Answer B is incorrect because a disaster recovery plan is a written document that
defines how the organization will recover from a disaster and how to restore business
with minimum delay. Answer C is incorrect because change documentation includes
specific details in regard to system changes, such as the files being replaced, the 
configuration being changed, and the machines or operating systems affected.

Objective 2.6: Explain the impact and proper
use of environmental controls.
1. Answer: B. The pipe in the wet-pipe system has water under pressure in it at all times.
Answer A is incorrect because dry-pipe systems work in exactly the same fashion as
wet-pipe systems, except that the pipes are filled with pressurized air rather than
water. Conventional deluge and preaction fire protection systems include a control
valve, commonly called a deluge valve, which normally prevents water from flowing
into a sprinkler line. Therefore, answers C and D are incorrect.
2. Answer: D. A wet-pipe system constantly has water in it. In dry-pipe systems, water is
used but is held back by a valve until a certain temperature is reached. Therefore,
answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
3. Answer: C. Class A fires are trash, wood, and paper. Answer A is incorrect because
Class C fires are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire. Answer B is incorrect
because Class B fires are flammable liquids, gases, and greases. Answer D is incorrect
because Class D fires are fires that involve combustible metals such as magnesium,
titanium, and sodium.
4. Answer: A, C. With UTP and STP, an inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easy to
add devices to the network via open ports on unsecured hubs and switches. Answer B
is incorrect because coax cables have no physical transmission security and are very
simple to tap without interrupting regular transmissions or being noticed. Answer D is
incorrect because it is impossible to tap fiber without interrupting the service and
using specially constructed equipment. This makes it more difficult to eavesdrop or
steal service.
5. Answer: A. Class C fires are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire. Answer B is
incorrect because Class B fires are flammable liquids, gases, and greases. Answer C is
incorrect. Class A fires are trash, wood, and paper. Answer D is incorrect. Class D fires
are fires that involve combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium, and sodium.
6. Answer: D. Class D fires are fires that involve combustible metals such as magne-
sium, titanium, and sodium. Answer A is incorrect because Class C fires are energized
electrical equipment, electrical fire. Answer B is incorrect because Class B fires are
flammable liquids, gases, and greases. Answer C is incorrect because Class A fires are
trash, wood, and paper.
7. Answer: B. Class B fires, which are flammable liquids, gases, and greases, are usually
put out using foam. Answer A is incorrect; for Class A fires, which are trash, wood,
and paper, water will decrease the fire’s temperature and extinguish its flames. Answer
C is incorrect because the two types of extinguishing agents for Class D fires are sodi-
um chloride and a copper-based dry powder. Answer D is incorrect; Class C fires,
which are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire, and burning wires, are put out
using extinguishers based on carbon dioxide or halon.
8. Answer: A. For Class A fires, which are trash, wood, and paper, water will decrease
the fire’s temperature and extinguish its flames. Answer B is incorrect. Class B fires,

are sodium chloride and a copper-based dry powder. Answer D is incorrect; Class C
fires, which are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire, and burning wires, are
put out using extinguishers based on carbon dioxide or halon.
9. Answer: D. Class C fires, which are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire, and
burning wires, are put out using extinguishers based on carbon dioxide or halon.
Answer A is incorrect. For Class A fires, which are trash, wood, and paper, water will
decrease the fire’s temperature and extinguish its flames. Answer B is incorrect; Class
B fires, which are flammable liquids, gases, and greases, are usually put out using
foam. Answer C is incorrect because the two types of extinguishing agents for Class D
fires are sodium chloride and a copper-based dry powder.
10. Answer: C. The two types of extinguishing agents for Class D fires are sodium chlo-
ride and a copper-based dry powder. Answer A is incorrect. For Class A fires, which
are trash, wood, and paper, water will decrease the fire’s temperature and extinguish
its flames. Answer B is incorrect; Class B fires, which are flammable liquids, gases,
and greases, are usually put out using foam. Answer D is incorrect; Class C fires,
which are energized electrical equipment, electrical fire, and burning wires, are put out
using extinguishers based on carbon dioxide or halon.
11. Answer: D. In 1987, an international agreement known as the Montreal Protocol man-
dated, because of emissions, the phase out of halons in developed countries by the
year 2000 and in less-developed countries by 2010. Therefore, carbon dioxide extin-
guishers have replaced halon ones. They don’t leave a harmful residue, making them a
good choice for an electrical fire on a computer or other electronic devices. Based on
this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
12. Answer: A, C, D. When choosing a location for a building, an organization should
investigate the type of neighborhood, population, crime rate, and emergency response
times. Answer B is incorrect because the proximity to an electronic store may be a
consideration, but it should not one of the deciding factors.
13. Answer: A. One of the reasons for using a dry-pipe system is that when the outside
temperature drops below freezing, any water in the pipes will freeze, causing them to
burst. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because deluge systems
are used in places that are considered high hazard areas, such as power plants, air-
craft hangars, and chemical storage or processing facilities. Deluge systems are need-
ed where high velocity suppression is necessary to prevent fire spread. Answer D is
incorrect; conventional preaction systems are relatively complex and expensive, tend-
ing to preclude the benefits of their use in low-cost, water-sensitive applications such
as small areas, and residential applications where the need to avoid inadvertent water
damage is as important as providing protection against fire damage.
14. Answer: B. Overcooling causes condensation on equipment, and too dry leads to
excessive static. Therefore, answer D is incorrect. Answers A and C are incorrect
because electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio frequency interference
(RFI), is a disturbance that affects an electrical circuit due to either electromagnetic
conduction or electromagnetic radiation emitted from an external source.

because electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio frequency interference
(RFI), is a disturbance that affects an electrical circuit due to either electromagnetic
conduction or electromagnetic radiation emitted from an external source.
16. Answer: A. A high level of humidity can cause components to rust and degrade elec-
trical resistance or thermal conductivity. Answer B is incorrect because a low level of
humidity can subject components to electrostatic discharge (ESD), causing damage.
Answer C is incorrect because EMF is associated with the electricity that comes out of
every power socket and higher-frequency radio waves that create electromagnetic
fields. Answer D is incorrect because solidification is the crystallization of a large
amount of material from a single point of nucleation resulting in a single crystal.
17. Answer: D. It is impossible to tap fiber without interrupting the service and using spe-
cially constructed equipment. This makes it more difficult to eavesdrop or steal serv-
ice. Answers A and C are incorrect. With UTP and STP, an inherent danger lies in the
fact that it is easy to add devices to the network via open ports on unsecured hubs
and switches. Answer B is incorrect because coax cables have no physical transmis-
sion security and are very simple to tap without interrupting regular transmissions or
being noticed.
18. Answer: C. An efficient way to protect a large quantity of equipment from electronic
eavesdropping is to place the equipment into a well-grounded metal box called a
Faraday cage. Answer A is incorrect; an electron configuration table is a type of code
that describes how many electrons are in each energy level of an atom and how the
electrons are arranged within each energy level. Answer B is incorrect because EMF 
is associated with the electricity that comes out of every power socket and higher-
frequency radio waves that create electromagnetic fields. Answer D is incorrect
because TEMPEST can be costly to implement, and protecting an area within a 
building makes more sense than protecting individual pieces of equipment.
19. Answer: D. You are most likely to find TEMPEST equipment in government, military,
and corporate environments that process government/military classified information.
Answer A is incorrect; an electron configuration table is a type of code that describes
how many electrons are in each energy level of an atom and how the electrons are
arranged within each energy level. Answer B is incorrect because EMF is associated
with the electricity that comes out of every power socket and higher-frequency radio
waves that create electromagnetic fields. Answer C is incorrect because although a
Faraday cage is an option, it protects an area within a building, not individual pieces of
equipment.
20. Answer: B. Coax cables have no physical transmission security and are very simple to
tap without interrupting regular transmissions or being noticed. Answers A and C are
incorrect; both UTP and STP are possible to tap, although it is physically a little trickier
than tapping coax cable because of the physical structure of STP and UTP cable.
Answer D is incorrect because it is impossible to tap fiber without interrupting the
service and using specially constructed equipment. This makes it more difficult to
eavesdrop or steal service.

1. Answer: A. A hot site is similar to the original site in that it has all the equipment
needed for the organization to continue operations. This type of site is similar to the
original site in that it is equipped with all necessary hardware, software, network, and
Internet connectivity fully installed, configured, and operational. Answer B is incorrect
because a warm site is a scaled-down version of a hot site. The site is generally con-
figured with power, phone, and network jacks. The site may have computers and other
resources, but they are not configured and ready to go. Answer C is incorrect because
a cold site does not provide any equipment. These sites are merely a prearranged
request to use facilities if needed. Electricity, bathrooms, and space are about the only
facilities provided in a cold site contract. Answer D is incorrect because a mirror site is
an exact copy of another Internet site.
2. Answer: C. A cold site does not provide any equipment. These sites are merely a pre-
arranged request to use facilities if needed. Electricity, bathrooms, and space are about
the only facilities provided in a cold site contract. Answer A is incorrect. A hot site is

3. Answer: C. A cold site is the weakest of the recovery plan options but also the cheap-
est. These sites are merely a prearranged request to use facilities if needed. Electricity,
bathrooms, and space are about the only facilities provided in a cold site contract.
Answer A is incorrect. A hot site is similar to the original site in that it has all the
equipment needed for the organization to continue operations, such as hardware and
furnishings. Answer B is incorrect because a warm site is a scaled-down version of a
hot site. The site is generally configured with power, phone, and network jacks. The
site may have computers and other resources, but they are not configured and ready
to go. Answer D is incorrect because a mirror site is an exact copy of another Internet
site.
4. Answer: B. A warm site is a scaled-down version of a hot site. The site is generally
configured with power, phone, and network jacks. The site may have computers and
other resources, but they are not configured and ready to go. Answer A is incorrect. A
hot site is similar to the original site in that it has all the equipment needed for the
organization to continue operations, such as hardware and furnishings. Answer C is
incorrect because a cold site does not provide any equipment. These sites are merely
a prearranged request to use facilities if needed. Answer D is incorrect because a mir-
ror site is an exact copy of another Internet site.
5. Answer: B. A warm site is a scaled-down version of a hot site. The site may have
computers and other resources, but they are not configured and ready to go. It is
assumed that the organization itself will configure the devices, install applications, and

activate resources or that it will contract with a third party for these services. Answer
A is incorrect because a hot site is similar to the original site in that it has all the
equipment needed for the organization to continue operations, such as hardware and
furnishings. Answer C is incorrect because a cold site does not provide any equip-
ment. These sites are merely a prearranged request to use facilities if needed. Answer
D is incorrect because a mirror site is an exact copy of another Internet site.
6. Answer: A. A hot site is a site location that is already running and is available 7 days a
week for 24 hours per day. Answer B is incorrect because a warm site is a scaled-
down version of a hot site. The site is generally configured with power, phone, and
network jacks. The site may have computers and other resources, but they are not
configured and ready to go. Answer C is incorrect because a cold site does not pro-
vide any equipment. These sites are merely a prearranged request to use facilities if
needed. Answer D is incorrect because a mirror site is an exact copy of another
Internet site.
7. Answer: A. A hot site is similar to the original site in that it has all the equipment
needed for the organization to continue operations. This type of site is similar to the
original site in that it is equipped with all necessary hardware, software, network, and
Internet connectivity fully installed, configured, and operational. Hot sites are tradition-
ally more expensive, but they can be used for operations and recovery testing before
an actual catastrophic event occurs. Answer B is incorrect because a warm site is a
scaled-down version of a hot site. The site is generally configured with power, phone,
and network jacks. Answer C is incorrect because a cold site does not provide any
equipment. These sites are merely a prearranged request to use facilities if needed.
Answer D is incorrect because a mirror site is an exact copy of another Internet site.
8. Answer: B. Backup power is a power supply that will run the power for your 
organization in the case of a power outage. This can be done through the use of a 
gas-powered generator. A generator can be used for rolling blackouts, emergency
blackouts, or electrical problems. Answer A is incorrect because an interruptible power
supply protects the environment from damaging fluctuations in power and cannot 
sustain power outages for a long period of time. Answer C is incorrect because most
electric companies only service one area. If it is possible to contract with another
service provider, the cost will most likely be prohibitive. Answer D is incorrect because
RAID does not protect against electrical failures.
9. Answer: A. Brownouts are short-term decreases in voltage levels that most often
occur when motors are started or are triggered by faults on the utility provider’s sys-
tem. To protect your environment from such damaging fluctuations in power, always
connect your sensitive electronic equipment to power conditioners, surge protectors,
and a UPS, which provides the best protection of all. Answer B is incorrect because a
generator is used for rolling blackouts, emergency blackouts, or electrical problems.
Answer C is incorrect because most electric companies service only one area. If it is
possible to contract with another service provider, the cost will most likely be prohibi-
tive. Answer D is incorrect because RAID does not protect against electrical failures.
10. Answer: A. Power variations called noise are also referred to as electromagnetic inter-
ference (EMI). To protect your environment from such damaging fluctuations in power,
always connect your sensitive electronic equipment to power conditioners, surge pro-
tectors, and a UPS, which provides the best protection of all. Answer B is incorrect

RAID does not protect against electrical failures.
12. Answer: D. In a continuous UPS, also called an “online” UPS, the computer is always
running off of battery power, and the battery is continuously being recharged. There is
no switchover time, and these supplies generally provide the best isolation from power
line problems. Answer A is incorrect. A surge protector is designed to protect electri-
cal devices from voltage spikes by limiting the surge to acceptable levels that electron-
ic equipment can handle. This device does not regulate or supply any power in the
event of sags. Answer B is incorrect. A standby power supply (SPS) is also referred 
to as an “offline” UPS. In this type of supply, power usually derives directly from the
power line, until power fails. Answer C is incorrect because a ferroresonant UPS 
system maintains a constant output voltage even with a varying input voltage and 
provides good protection against line noise.
13. Answer: C. A ferroresonant UPS system maintains a constant output voltage even
with a varying input voltage and provides good protection against line noise. Answer A
is incorrect; a surge protector is designed to protect electrical devices from voltage
spikes, not supply power. Answer B is incorrect; a standby power supply (SPS) is also
referred to as an “offline” UPS. In this type of supply, power usually derives directly
from the power line, until power fails. Answer D is incorrect; in a continuous UPS, 
also called an “online” UPS, the computer is always running off of battery power, and
the battery is continuously being recharged. There is no switchover time, and these
supplies generally provide the best isolation from power line problems.

15. Answer: C. If the majority of your business is telephone based, you might look for
redundancy in the phone system as opposed to the ISP. Therefore, Answer B is incor-
rect. Answer A is incorrect because if the servers failed, phone donations could still be

taken via pen and paper. Answer D is incorrect because although data disk redundancy
for the storage of data is important, without a phone system, the business could not
function.
16. Answer: B. If all your business is web based, to provide continued customer access it
is a good idea to have some redundancy in the event the Internet connection goes
down. Answer A is incorrect because if one of the servers failed, business could still
be conducted. Answer C is incorrect. If the majority of your business is telephone
based, you might look for redundancy in the phone system as opposed to the ISP, and
this is not the case. Answer D is incorrect because although data disk redundancy for
the storage of data is important, without an Internet connection, the business could
not function.
17. Answer: D. The primary function of the business is to provide a backup service.
Without data disk redundancy, the business could not operate. Answer A is incorrect
because if one of the servers failed, business could be conducted. Answer B is incor-
rect because the main business purpose is to provide backup service. The temporary
loss of the Internet connection going down is not as damaging as losing a data disk.
Answer C is incorrect; if the majority of your business is telephone based, you might
look for redundancy in the phone system, and this is not the case.
18. Answer: A. It might be necessary to set up redundant servers so that the business can
still function in the event of hardware or software failure. If a single server hosts vital
applications, a simple equipment failure might result in days of downtime as the prob-
lem is repaired. Answer B is incorrect; the main business purpose is to provide data
warehousing. The temporary loss of the Internet connection going down is not as
damaging as losing a vital server. Answer C is incorrect because if the majority of your
business is telephone based, you might look for redundancy in the phone system, and
this is not the case. Answer D is incorrect because although data disk redundancy for
the storage of data is important, the business could still function if a disk was lost.
19. Answer: B. Neglecting single points of failure can prove disastrous. A single point 
of failure is any piece of equipment that can bring your operation down if it stops
working. Based on this, the Internet connection would be the single point of failure.
Answers A, C, and D are incorrect; there is more than one of each of these pieces of
equipment, so they are not single points of failure.
20. Answer: A. RAID Level 0 is a striped disk array without fault tolerance. Answer B is
incorrect. RAID Level 1 is mirroring and duplexing. This solution requires a minimum
of two disks and offers 100% redundancy because all data is written to both disks.
Answer C is incorrect; RAID Level 5 consists of independent data disks with distrib-
uted parity blocks. In RAID 5, each entire block of the data and the parity is striped.
Answer D is incorrect; RAID Level 10 is high reliability combined with high perform-
ance. This solution is a striped array that has RAID 1 arrays.
21. Answer: D. RAID Level 10 is high reliability combined with high performance. This
solution is a striped array that has RAID 1 arrays. Answer A is incorrect because RAID
Level 0 is a striped disk array without fault tolerance. Answer B is incorrect because
RAID Level 1 is mirroring and duplexing. This solution requires a minimum of two
disks and offers 100% redundancy because all data is written to both disks. Answer C
is incorrect because RAID Level 5 consists of independent data disks with distributed
parity blocks. In RAID 5, each entire block of the data and the parity is striped.

132
Chapter 2
22. Answer: C. In RAID 5, each entire block of the data and the parity is striped. Because
it writes both the data and the parity over all the disks, it has the best small read/large
write performance of any redundancy disk array. Answer A is incorrect because RAID
Level 0 is a striped disk array without fault tolerance. Answer B is incorrect because
RAID Level 1 is mirroring and duplexing. This solution requires a minimum of two
disks and offers 100% redundancy because all data is written to both disks. Answer D
is incorrect; RAID Level 10 is high reliability combined with high performance. This
solution is a striped array that has RAID 1 arrays.
23. Answer: B. RAID Level 1 is mirroring and duplexing. This solution requires a mini-
mum of two disks and offers 100% redundancy because all data is written to both
disks. RAID 1 disk usage is 50% and the other 50% is for redundancy. Answer A is
incorrect because RAID Level 0 is a striped disk array without fault tolerance. Answer
C is incorrect because RAID Level 5 consists of independent data disks with distrib-
uted parity blocks. In RAID 5, each entire block of the data and the parity is striped.
Answer D is incorrect because RAID Level 10 is high reliability combined with high
performance. This solution is a striped array that has RAID 1 arrays.
24. Answer: C. In the event of a disaster, an organization might also need to restore
equipment (in addition to data). One of the best ways to ensure the availability of
replacement parts is through service level agreements (SLAs). Answer A is incorrect
because this solution consumes space and does not ensure that correct replacement
parts will be available. Answers B and D are incorrect; they are too costly.
25. Answer: B. In disaster recovery planning, you might need to consider redundant 
connections between branches or sites. Because the records must be available
between offices, this is the single point of failure that requires redundancy. Based 
on this information, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
26. Answer: C. Saturday’s full backup must be installed, followed by Monday’s incremen-
tal backup, and finally Tuesday morning’s incremental backup. This will recover all data
as of 3:00 a.m. Tuesday morning. Answer A is incorrect because a full backup Tuesday
morning would be required to allow a single tape recovery of all data. Answer B is
incorrect because A differential backup on Tuesday morning would be required in 
addition to the full backup so that only two backup tapes would be needed. Answer D
is incorrect because four tapes would not be required.
27. Answer: B. A differential backup on Thursday morning would be required in addition
to the full backup so that only two backup tapes would be needed. Answer A is incor-
rect because a full backup Thursday morning would be required to allow a single tape
recovery of all data. Answer C is incorrect; Saturday’s full backup must be installed,
followed by Monday’s, Tuesday’s, Wednesday’s, and Thursday’s incremental backup
tapes. Answer D is incorrect because four tapes would not be required.
28. Answer: D. In the event of a total loss of data, restoration from a full backup will be
faster than other methods. Answers A and B are incorrect; each of these methods will
require more than one tape and take longer than restoring from a full backup. Answer
C is incorrect because a copy backup copies all the selected files, but does not mark
the files as having been backed up. This backup type is useful for backing up single
files between normal and incremental backups because it does not affect these 
operations.

29. Answer: A. Grandfather-father-son backup refers to the most common rotation
scheme for rotating backup media. Originally designed for tape backup, it works well
for any hierarchical backup strategy. The basic method is to define three sets of back-
ups, such as daily, weekly, and monthly. Answers B and C are incorrect; neither of
these are valid backup methods. Answer D is incorrect because the Tower of Hanoi is
based on the mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, with what is essentially a
recursive method.
30. Answer: D. The Tower of Hanoi is based on the mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi
puzzle, with what is essentially a recursive method. It is a “smart” way of archiving an
effective number of backups and provides the ability to go back over time. The Tower
of Hanoi is more difficult to implement and manage but costs less than the grandfa-
ther-father-son scheme. Answer A is incorrect; grandfather-father-son backup refers to
the most common rotation scheme for rotating backup media. Originally designed for
tape backup, it works well for any hierarchical backup strategy. Answer B is incorrect
because ten-tape rotation is a simpler and more cost-effective method for small busi-
nesses. It provides a data history of up to two weeks. Answer C is incorrect; this is not
a valid backup method.
Objective 2.8: Exemplify the concepts of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
1. Answer: A. Confidentiality is concerned with the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
information. Answer B is incorrect; integrity pertains to preventing unauthorized 
modifications of information or systems. Answer C is incorrect; authorization is the
function of specifying access rights to resources. Answer D is incorrect; availability is
about maintaining continuous operations and preventing service disruptions.
2. Answer: B. Integrity pertains to preventing unauthorized modifications of information
or systems. Answer A is incorrect; confidentiality is concerned with the unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive information. Answer C is incorrect; authorization is the function
of specifying access rights to resources. Answer D is incorrect; availability is about
maintaining continuous operations and preventing service disruptions.
3. Answer: D. Availability is about maintaining continuous operations and preventing
service disruptions. Answer A is incorrect; confidentiality is concerned with the unau-
thorized disclosure of sensitive information. Answer B is incorrect; integrity pertains 
to preventing unauthorized modifications of information or systems. Answer C is
incorrect; authorization is the function of specifying access rights to resources.
4. Answer: A, C. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a computer program used for signing,
encrypting, and decrypting email messages. PGP is used to send and receive emails in
a confidential, secure fashion. Answer B is incorrect. Availability is about maintaining
continuous operations and preventing service disruptions. Answer D is incorrect;
authorization is the function of specifying access rights to resources.
5. Answer: A. Integrity is the assurance that data and information can be modified only
by those authorized to do so. Answer B is incorrect; availability refers to the accessi-
bility of information and information systems, when they are needed. Answer C is

Chapter 2
incorrect; confidentiality describes the act of limiting disclosure of private information.
Answer D is incorrect because authorization is the function of specifying access rights
to resources.
6. Answer: C. Confidentiality describes the act of limiting disclosure of private informa-
tion. Answer A is incorrect; integrity is the assurance that data and information can 
be modified only by those authorized to do so. Answer B is incorrect; availability refers
to the accessibility of information and information systems, when they are needed.
Answer D is incorrect because authorization is the function of specifying access rights
to resources.
7. Answer: B. Availability refers to the accessibility of information and information sys-
tems, when they are needed. Answer A is incorrect; integrity is the assurance that data
and information can be modified only by those authorized to do so. Answer C is incor-
rect; confidentiality describes the act of limiting disclosure of private information.
Answer D is incorrect because authorization is the function of specifying access rights
to resources.
8. Answer: C, D. Environmental controls such as antistatic carpeting aid in protecting
against system failure and so preserve availability of data and services. Physical
access controls protect against system theft, destruction, or damage. Answer A is
incorrect because firewalls restrict access data and services, and although deletion is
possible, this control is focused on preserving confidentiality and integrity. Answer B
is incorrect because mirrored windows protect confidentiality by preventing observa-
tion of displayed data, user keystrokes, and other information of potential interest.
9. Answer: B. Malware defenses such as antivirus services protect the confidentiality and
integrity of data by eliminating viral agents that could otherwise capture keystrokes,
relay webcam audio/video, or modify data and services. Answers A and D are incorrect
because malware defenses are not focused on the preservation of data and service
availability, beyond preventing outright wipe of the infected system. Answer C is incor-
rect because accuracy and reliability are data qualities within the Integrity principle,
not directly parts of the C-I-A Triad.
10. Answer: C, D. Regular password expiration protects against re-use of compromised
passwords and mitigates brute-force attacks by changing keys before all combinations
can be tested. These actions protect access controls over data review and modifica-
tion, preserving confidentiality and integrity of data. Answer B is incorrect because
password expiration does not directly impact data and service availability. Similarly,
answer A is incorrect because data longevity is unrelated to passwords and exists only
as business operations allow. Some data may be updated many times every minute,
while other data remains static for years.

Answers and Explanations
Objective 3.1: Analyze and differentiate
among types of malware.
1. Answer: A. Perhaps the most popular method of privilege escalation is a buffer over-
flow attack. Buffer overflows cause disruption of service and lost data. This condition
occurs when the data presented to an application or service exceeds the storage-space
allocation that has been reserved in memory for that application or service. Answer B
is incorrect because programs disguised as useful applications are Trojans. Trojans do
not replicate themselves like viruses, but they can be just as destructive. Code is hid-
den inside the application that can attack your system directly or allow the system to
be compromised by the code’s originator. The Trojan is typically hidden, so its ability
to spread depends on the popularity of the software (such as a game) and a user’s
willingness to download and install the software. Answer C is incorrect because a
virus is a program or piece of code designed to attach itself to other code and repli-
cate. It replicates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer D is incorrect
because spyware is associated with behaviors such as advertising, collecting personal
information, or changing your computer configuration without appropriately obtaining
prior consent. Basically, spyware is software that communicates information from a
user’s system to another party without notifying the user.
2. Answer: C. A program or piece of code that runs on your computer without your
knowledge is a virus. It is designed to attach itself to other code and replicate. It 
replicates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer A is incorrect. Buffer
overflows cause disruption of service and lost data. This condition occurs when the
data presented to an application or service exceeds the storage-space allocation that
has been reserved in memory for that application or service. Answer B is incorrect
because programs disguised as useful applications are Trojans. Trojans do not repli-
cate themselves like viruses, but they can be just as destructive. Code is hidden inside
the application that can attack your system directly or allow the system to be compro-
mised by the code’s originator. The Trojan is typically hidden, so its ability to spread
depends on the popularity of the software and a user’s willingness to download and
install the software. Answer D is incorrect because spyware is associated with behav-
iors such as advertising, collecting personal information, or changing your computer
configuration without appropriately obtaining prior consent. Basically, spyware is 
software that communicates information from a user’s system to another party 
without notifying the user.
3. Answer: A. A Trojan horse appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside
that will attack your system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by the origina-
tor of the code after it has been executed. Answer B is incorrect because it describes
IP spoofing. Answer C is incorrect because it describes spyware. Answer D is incor-
rect because it describes a worm. Worms are similar in function and behavior to a
virus with the exception that worms are self-replicating.

185
4. Answer: B. A rootkit is a piece of software that can be installed and hidden on a 
computer mainly for the purpose of compromising the system and getting escalated
privileges such as administrative rights. Answer A is incorrect because spyware is
associated with behaviors such as advertising, collecting personal information, or
changing your computer configuration without appropriately obtaining prior consent.
Basically, spyware is software that communicates information from a user’s system to
another party without notifying the user. Answer C is incorrect. A bot provides a spam
or virus originator with the venue to propagate. Many computers compromised in this
way are unprotected home computers (although recently it has become known that
many computers in the corporate world are bots, too). A botnet is a large number of
computers that forward transmissions to other computers on the Internet. You may
also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie army. Answer D is incorrect. Adware is a
form of advertising that installs additional tracking software on your system that keeps
in contact with the company through your Internet connection. It reports data to the
company, such as your surfing habits and which sites you have visited.
5. Answer: C. Code Red is an exploit used to spread a worm. This threat affected only
web servers running Microsoft’s Internet Information Server. Answers A, B, and D are
incorrect; Melissa, Acid Rain, and Mocmex are not worms. Melissa is a virus. Acid
Rain and Mocmex are Trojans.
6. Answer: B. A logic bomb is a virus or Trojan horse that is built to go off when a cer-
tain event occurs or a period of time goes by. Answers A and D are incorrect because
a specified time element is not involved. Answer C is incorrect because spoofing
involves modifying the source address of traffic or the source of information.
7. Answer: A. Spyware is associated with behaviors such as advertising, collecting per-
sonal information, or changing your computer configuration without appropriately
obtaining prior consent. Basically, spyware is software that communicates information
from a user’s system to another party without notifying the user. Answer B is incorrect
because a piece of software that can be installed and hidden on a computer mainly for
the purpose of compromising the system and getting escalated privileges such as
administrative rights is a rootkit. Answer C is incorrect because a large number of
computers that forward transmissions to other computers on the Internet, allowing the
originator a venue to propagate, is a botnet. Answer D is incorrect because a form of
advertising that installs additional tracking software on your system that keeps in con-
tact with the company through your Internet connection is adware. It reports data to
the company, such as your surfing habits and which sites you have visited.
8. Answer: C. Requesting to be removed from junk email lists often results in more
spam because it verifies that you have a legitimate, working email address. Therefore
answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
9. Answer: A, B, C. Email spam lists are often created by scanning newsgroup postings,
stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the Web for addresses. Spammers use
automated tools to subscribe to as many mailing lists as possible. From those lists,
they capture addresses or use the mailing list as a direct target for their attacks.
Answer D is incorrect because email spam lists are not created in this manner.

10. Answer: A. Perhaps the most popular method of privilege escalation is a buffer over-
flow attack. Buffer overflows cause disruption of service and lost data. This condition
occurs when the data presented to an application or service exceeds the storage-space
allocation that has been reserved in memory for that application or service. Answer B
is incorrect because a virus is a program or piece of code designed to attach itself to

Answer C is incorrect. A Trojan horse appears to be useful software but has code hid-
den inside that will attack your system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by
the originator of the code after it has been executed. Answer D is incorrect. A logic
bomb is a virus or Trojan horse designed to execute malicious actions when a certain
event occurs or a period of time goes by.
11. Answer: D. Worms are similar in function and behavior to a virus with the exception
that worms are self-replicating. A worm is built to take advantage of a security hole in
an existing application or operating system and then find other systems running the
same software and automatically replicate itself to the new host. Answer A is incor-
rect. Spyware is associated with behaviors such as collecting personal information or
changing your computer configuration without appropriately obtaining prior consent.
Basically, spyware is software that communicates information from a user’s system to
another party without notifying the user. Answer B is incorrect because a virus is a
program or piece of code designed to attach itself to other code and replicate. It repli-
cates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer C is incorrect. A Trojan

12. Answer: C. A Trojan horse appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside

ed with behaviors such as collecting personal information or changing your computer

ware that communicates information from a user’s system to another party without

behavior to a virus with the exception that worms are self-replicating. A worm is built
to take advantage of a security hole in an existing application or operating system and
then find other systems running the same software and automatically replicate itself to
the new host.
13. Answer: A. Spyware is associated with behaviors such as collecting personal informa-
tion or changing your computer configuration without appropriately obtaining prior
consent. Basically, spyware is software that communicates information from a user’s
system to another party without notifying the user. Answer B is incorrect because a
virus is a program or piece of code designed to attach itself to other code and repli-
cate. It replicates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer C is incorrect.
A Trojan horse appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside that will
attack your system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by the originator of the
code after it has been executed. Answer D is incorrect. Worms are similar in function
and behavior to a virus with the exception that worms are self-replicating. A worm is

built to take advantage of a security hole in an existing application or operating system
and then find other systems running the same software and automatically replicate
itself to the new host.
14. Answer: D. A rootkit is a piece of software that can be installed and hidden on a com-
puter mainly for the purpose of compromising the system and getting escalated privi-
leges such as administrative rights. Answer A is incorrect. Spyware is associated with
behaviors such as advertising, collecting personal information, or changing your com-
puter configuration without appropriately obtaining prior consent. Basically, spyware is
software that communicates information from a user’s system to another party with-
out notifying the user. Answer B is incorrect. Spam is a term that refers to the sending
of unsolicited commercial email. Email spam targets individual users with direct mail
messages. Answer C is incorrect because adware is a form of advertising that installs
additional tracking software on your system that keeps in contact with the company
through your Internet connection.
15. Answer: B. A botnet is a large number of computers that forward transmissions to
other computers on the Internet. You may also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie
army. Answer A is incorrect. A logic bomb is a virus or Trojan horse designed to exe-
cute malicious actions when a certain event occurs or a period of time goes by.
Answer C is incorrect. Adware is a form of advertising that installs additional tracking
software on your system that keeps in contact with the company through your Internet
connection. It reports data to the company, such as your surfing habits and which
sites you have visited. Answer D is incorrect. A rootkit is a piece of software that can
be installed and hidden on a computer mainly for the purpose of compromising the
system and getting escalated privileges such as administrative rights.
16. Answer: A. Many spyware-eliminator programs are available. These programs scan
your machine, similarly to how antivirus software scans for viruses; just as with
antivirus software, you should keep spyware-eliminator programs updated and regu-
larly run scans. Therefore, answer D is incorrect. Answers B and C are incorrect
because antispyware programs cannot detect rootkits or botnets.
17. Answer: B. The main issue with botnets is that they are securely hidden. This allows
the botnet masters to perform tasks, gather information, and commit crimes while
remaining undetected. Answers A, C, and D are concerns, but the main security con-
cern it is they can remain undetected.
18. Answer: A. A logic bomb is also referred to as slag code. It is malicious in intent, and
usually planted by a disgruntled employee. Answer B is incorrect. A botnet is a large
number of computers that forward transmissions to other computers on the Internet.
You may also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie army. Answer C is incorrect.
Adware is a form of advertising that installs additional tracking software on your sys-
tem that keeps in contact with the company through your Internet connection. It
reports data to the company, such as your surfing habits and which sites you have
visited. Answer D is incorrect. A rootkit is a piece of software that can be installed and
hidden on a computer mainly for the purpose of compromising the system and getting
escalated privileges such as administrative rights.
19. Answer: A, B, D. A buffer overflow can result in the overwriting of data or memory
storage, a denial of service due to overloading the input buffer’s ability to cope with

188
Chapter 3
the additional data, or the originator can execute arbitrary code, often at a privileged
level. Answer C is incorrect because a buffer overflow is targeted toward an individual
machine.
20. Answer: A, C. There are several types of viruses, including boot sector, polymorphic,
macro, program, stealth, and multipartite. Answers B and D are incorrect because they
do not describe types of viruses.
21. Answer: C. A boot sector virus is placed into the first sector of the hard drive so that
when the computer boots, the virus loads into memory. Answer A is incorrect because
it describes a polymorphic virus. Answer B is incorrect because it describes a stealth
virus. Answer D is incorrect because it describes a program virus.
22. Answer: D. A botnet is a large number of computers that forward transmissions to
other computers on the Internet. You may also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie
army. Answer A is incorrect because a popular method of privilege escalation is a
buffer-overflow attack. Answer B is incorrect because most rootkits use global hooks
for stealth activity. Answer C is incorrect because a honeynet is used for monitoring
large networks.
23. Answer: B. A Trojan horse appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside
that will attack your system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by the origina-
tor of the code after it has been executed. Answer A is incorrect because a virus is a
program or piece of code designed to attach itself to other code and replicate. It repli-
cates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer C is incorrect because
spam is a term that refers to the sending of unsolicited commercial email. Email spam
targets individual users with direct mail messages. Answer D is incorrect. Worms 
are similar in function and behavior to a virus with the exception that worms are self-
replicating. A worm is built to take advantage of a security hole in an existing applica-
tion or operating system, find other systems running the same software, and automat-
ically replicate itself to the new host.
24. Answer: A. Most rootkits use global hooks for stealth activity. So, if you use security
tools that can prevent programs from installing global hooks and stop process injec-
tion, you can prevent rootkit functioning. Answer B is incorrect because adware uses
tracking software. Answer C is incorrect because privilege escalation is associated
with buffer overflows. Answer D is incorrect because social engineering is taking
advantage of human nature.
25. Answer: B. Rootkit functionality requires full administrator rights. Therefore, you can
avoid rootkit infection by running Windows from an account with lesser privileges.
Answer A is incorrect; it describes an effective way to deal with spam. Answer C is
incorrect; it describes an effective way to deal with user account exploitation. Answer
D is incorrect because it describes an effective way to deal with spyware.
26. Answer: C. A botnet is a large number of computers that forward transmissions to
other computers on the Internet. You may also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie
army. Answer A is incorrect because it describes a logic bomb. Answer B is incorrect
because it describes Trojans. Answer D is incorrect because it describes a buffer 
overflow.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities

27. Answer: B. Privilege escalation takes advantage of a program’s flawed code, which
then crashes the system and leaves it in a state where arbitrary code can be executed
or an intruder can function as an administrator. Answer A is incorrect because a logic
bomb is a virus or Trojan horse designed to execute malicious actions when a certain
event occurs or a period of time goes by. Answer C is incorrect; spam is a term that
refers to the sending of unsolicited commercial email. Email spam targets individual
users with direct mail messages. Answer D is incorrect; Trojans are programs dis-
guised as useful applications.
28. Answer: A, C, D. Currently, the most effective way to prevent an attacker from exploit-
ing software is to keep the manufacturer’s latest patches and service packs applied
and to monitor the Web for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Answer B is incorrect
because it not feasible to disconnect the network from the Internet.
29. Answer: D. A multipartite virus is a hybrid of boot and program viruses. It first attacks
a boot sector and then attacks system files or vice versa. Answer A is incorrect
because a polymorphic virus can change each time it is executed. It was developed to
avoid detection by antivirus software. Answer B is incorrect because a macro virus is
inserted into a Microsoft Office document and emailed to unsuspecting users. Answer
C is incorrect because a stealth virus uses techniques to avoid detection, such as tem-
porarily removing itself from an infected file or masking a file’s size.
30. Answer: C. Worms are similar in function and behavior to a virus with the exception
that worms are self-replicating. A worm is built to take advantage of a security hole in
an existing application or operating system, find other systems running the same soft-
ware, and automatically replicate itself to the new host. Answer A is incorrect because
a virus is a program or piece of code designed to attach itself to other code and repli-
cate. It replicates when an infected file is executed or launched. Answer B is incorrect
because a Trojan appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside that will
attack your system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by the originator of the
code after it has been executed. Answer D is incorrect because a logic bomb is a virus
or Trojan horse designed to execute malicious actions when a certain event occurs or
a period of time goes by.
31. Answer: B. Trojans are programs disguised as useful applications. Trojans do not
replicate themselves like viruses, but they can be just as destructive. Code hidden
inside the application can attack your system directly or allow the system to be com-
promised by the code’s originator. The Trojan is typically hidden, so its ability to
spread depends on the popularity of the software and a user’s willingness to download
and install the software. Answer A is incorrect because Trojans can perform actions
without the user’s knowledge or consent, such as collecting and sending data or caus-
ing the computer to malfunction. Answers C and D are incorrect; a virus is a program
or piece of code that runs on your computer without your knowledge. It is designed to
attach itself to other code and replicate.
32. Answer: A, B, C. Indications that a computer may contain spyware include the follow-
ing: the system is slow, (especially when browsing the Internet), it takes a long time
for the Windows desktop to come up, clicking a link does nothing or goes to an unex-
pected website, the browser home page changes (and you might not be able to reset
it), and web pages are automatically added to your favorites list. Answer D is incorrect
because it describes spam.

190
Chapter 3
33. Answer: A, C. When dealing with spam, the user should delete the email without
opening it and turn off the preview function of the mail software. Answer B is incorrect
because this is an inappropriate action. There are specific laws that deal with spam-
ming, and trying to conduct your own investigation can be dangerous. Answer D is
incorrect because local law enforcement does not investigate a single spam incident.
34. Answer: B, C, D. Rootkits can be included as part of a software package and can be
installed by way of an unpatched vulnerability or by the user downloading and
installing it. Answer A is incorrect because accessing documents on the local intranet
should not result in a rootkit installation.
35. Answer: D. Rootkits have also been known to use encryption to protect outbound
communications and piggyback on commonly used ports to communicate without
interrupting other applications that use that port. Answer A is incorrect. A logic bomb
is a virus or Trojan horse designed to execute malicious actions when a certain event
occurs or a period of time goes by. Answer B is incorrect. A botnet is a large number
of computers that forward transmissions to other computers on the Internet. You may
also hear a botnet referred to as a zombie army. Answer C is incorrect. Adware is a
form of advertising that installs additional tracking software on your system that keeps
in contact with the company through your Internet connection. It reports data to the
company, such as your surfing habits and which sites you have visited.

38. Answer: A. A polymorphic virus can change each time it is executed. It was developed
to avoid detection by antivirus software. Answer B is incorrect because a macro virus
is inserted into a Microsoft Office document and emailed to unsuspecting users.
Answer C is incorrect because a stealth virus uses techniques to avoid detection, such
as temporarily removing itself from an infected file or masking a file’s size. Answer D
is incorrect because a multipartite virus is a hybrid of boot and program viruses. It
first attacks a boot sector and then attacks system files, or vice versa.

39. Answer: C. A bot, short for robot, is an automated computer program that needs no
user interaction. Bots are systems that outside sources can control. A bot provides a
spam or virus originator with the venue to propagate. Answer A is incorrect because a
logic bomb is a virus or Trojan horse designed to execute malicious actions when a
certain event occurs or a period of time goes by. Answer B is incorrect. Adware is a
form of advertising that installs additional tracking software on your system that keeps
in contact with the company through your Internet connection. It reports data to the

40. Answer: A, C, D. You can take steps to protect your network from malicious code,
such as not using any type of removable media from another user without first scan-
ning for malware, performing backups on a daily basis, installing firewalls or intru-
sion-prevention systems on client machines, and subscribing to newsgroups and
checking antivirus websites regularly. Answer B is incorrect. Opening all attachments
will mostly likely infect a machine.
Objective 3.2: Analyze and differentiate
among types of attacks.
1. Answer: C. Telnet uses port 23. Answer A is incorrect because port 110 is used for
POP3 incoming mail. Answer B is incorrect because port 21 is used for FTP. Port 443
is used by HTTPS; therefore, answer D is incorrect.
2. Answer: A, B. UDP ports 161 and 162 are used by SNMP. Answer C is incorrect
because port 443 is used by HTTPS. Answer D is incorrect because port 4445 uses
TCP/UDP for service type upnotifyp.
3. Answer: C. TCP/IP hijacking is the term used when an attacker takes control of a 
session between the server and a client. This can occur due to the TCP three-way
handshake. The three-way handshake is the method used to establish and tear down
network connections. Answer A is incorrect because it describes spoofing. Spoofing is
a method of providing false identity information to gain unauthorized access. Answer
B is incorrect because it describes a null session. A null session is a connection with-
out specifying a username or password. Answer D is incorrect because it describes
DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning allows a perpetrator to redirect traffic by changing the
IP record for a specific domain, thus permitting attackers to send legitimate traffic
anywhere they choose.
4. Answer: A. Spoofing is a method of providing false identity information to gain unau-
thorized access. Answer B is incorrect because it describes a null session. A null 
session is a connection without specifying a username or password. Answer C is
incorrect because it describes TCP/IP hijacking. TCP/IP hijacking is the term used
when an attacker takes control of a session between the server and a client. Answer D
is incorrect because it describes DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning allows a perpetrator
to redirect traffic by changing the IP record for a specific domain, thus permitting
attackers to send legitimate traffic anywhere they choose.

Chapter 3
5. Answer: B. A null session is a connection without specifying a username or password.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes spoofing. Spoofing is a method of provid-
ing false identity information to gain unauthorized access. Answer C is incorrect
because it describes TCP/IP hijacking. TCP/IP hijacking is the term used when an
attacker takes control of a session between the server and a client. Answer D is 
incorrect because it describes DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning allows a perpetrator 
to redirect traffic by changing the IP record for a specific domain, thus permitting
attackers to send legitimate traffic anywhere they choose.
6. Answer: D. DNS poisoning allows a perpetrator to redirect traffic by changing the IP
record for a specific domain. Query results that are forged and returned to the
requesting client or recursive DNS query can poison the DNS records, thus permitting
attackers to send legitimate traffic anywhere they choose. Answer A is incorrect
because it describes spoofing. Spoofing is a method of providing false identity infor-
mation to gain unauthorized access. Answer B is incorrect because it describes a null
session. A null session is a connection without specifying a username or password.
Answer C is incorrect because it describes TCP/IP hijacking. TCP/IP hijacking is the
term used when an attacker takes control of a session between the server and a client.
7. Answer: D. The man-in-the-middle attack takes place when an attacker intercepts traf-
fic and then tricks the parties at both ends into believing that they are communicating
with each other. Answer A is incorrect; it describes DNS kiting. DNS kiting refers to
the practice of taking advantage of the add/grace period (AGP) to monopolize domain
names without ever paying for them. Answer B is incorrect; it describes a replay
attack. In a replay attack, packets are captured by using sniffers. After the pertinent
information is extracted, the packets are placed back on the network. Answer C is
incorrect; it describes a denial-of-service attack. The purpose of a DoS attack is to 
disrupt the resources or services that a user would expect to have access to.
8. Answer: B. In a replay attack, packets are captured by using sniffers. After the perti-
nent information is extracted, the packets are placed back on the network. Answer A is
incorrect; it describes DNS kiting. DNS kiting refers to the practice of taking advantage
of the AGP to monopolize domain names without ever paying for them. Answer C is
incorrect; it describes a denial-of-service attack. The purpose of a DoS attack is to dis-
rupt the resources or services that a user would expect to have access to. Answer D is
incorrect; it describes a man-in-the-middle attack. The man-in-the-middle attack takes
place when an attacker intercepts traffic and then tricks the parties at both ends into
believing that they are communicating with each other.
9. Answer: C. The purpose of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is to disrupt
the resources or services that a user would expect to have access to. Answer A is
incorrect; it describes DNS kiting. DNS kiting refers to the practice of taking advantage
of the AGP to monopolize domain names without ever paying for them. Answer B is
incorrect; it describes a replay attack. In a replay attack, packets are captured by using
sniffers. After the pertinent information is extracted, the packets are placed back on
the network. Answer D is incorrect; it describes a man-in-the-middle attack. The man-
in-the-middle attack takes place when an attacker intercepts traffic and then tricks the
parties at both ends into believing that they are communicating with each other.
10. Answer: A, B, D. To help protect your network, you can set up filters on external
routers to drop packets involved in these types of attacks. You should also set up

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
193
another filter that denies traffic originating from the Internet that shows an internal
network address. If the operating system allows it, reduce the amount of time before
the reset of an unfinished TCP connection. Doing so makes it harder to keep resources
unavailable for extended periods of time. Answer C is incorrect; increasing the amount
of time before the reset of an unfinished TCP connection makes the resources unavail-
able for a longer period of time.
11. Answer: A. Because ARP does not require any type of validation, as ARP requests are
sent, the requesting devices believe that the incoming ARP replies are from the correct
devices. This can allow a perpetrator to trick a device into thinking any IP is related to
any MAC address. Answer B is incorrect because it describes DNS poisoning. Answer
C is incorrect. A Teardrop attack sends fragmented UDP packets. Answer D is incor-
rect. In a DDoS attack, the attackers distribute zombie software that allows the attacker
partial or full control of the infected computer system.
12. Answer: B. A null session is a connection without specifying a username or password.
Null sessions are a possible security risk because the connection is not really authenti-
cated. Answer A is incorrect because spoofing involves modifying the source address
of traffic or source of information. Answer C is incorrect because ARP poisoning
allows a perpetrator to trick a device into thinking that an incorrect IP address is relat-
ed to a MAC address. The implementation of the ARP protocol is simple. The receipt
of an ARP reply at any time causes the receiving computer to add the newly received
information to its ARP cache without any type of verification. Answer D is incorrect
because domain kiting refers to the practice of taking advantage of this AGP period to
monopolize domain names without ever paying for them.
13. Answer: D. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack that attempts to block service or reduce
activity on a host by sending ping requests directly to the victim using ICMP is called
a ping flood. Answer A is incorrect because spoofing involves modifying the source
address of traffic or source of information. Answer C is incorrect because a man-in-
the middle attack is commonly used to gather information in transit between two
hosts. Answer B is incorrect because the purpose of a DoS attack is to disrupt the
resources or services that a user would expect to have access to.
14. Answer: C. A man-in-the-middle attack is commonly used to gather information in
transit between two hosts. Answer A is incorrect because spoofing involves modifying
the source address of traffic or source of information. ARP poisoning allows a perpe-
trator to trick a device into thinking any IP is related to any MAC address; therefore,
Answer B is incorrect. Because the purpose of a DoS attack is to deny use of
resources or services to legitimate users, answer D is incorrect.
15. Answer: B. A null session is a connection without specifying a username or password.
Null sessions are a possible security risk because the connection is not really authenti-
cated. Answer A is incorrect because the session is not abnormally terminated.
Although answer C may be a concern, it is not the primary issue. Answer D is incor-
rect because null sessions are direct connections and are not remote controlled.
16. Answer: D. The most effective way to reduce null session vulnerability is by disabling
NetBIOS over TCP/IP. Editing the Registry to restrict anonymous access is another
method used to control null session access. After you have done this, verify that ports
139 and 445 are closed. Answer A is incorrect; reducing the amount of time before the

194
Chapter 3
reset of an unfinished TCP connection deals with DoS attacks. Answers B and C are
incorrect; using the signing capabilities of certificates and denying traffic originating
from the Internet that shows an internal network address are protective measures
against spoofing.
17. Answer: B, C, D. To mitigate the effects of spoofing, you should set up a filter that
denies traffic originating from the Internet that shows an internal network address.
Using the signing capabilities of certificates on servers and clients allows web and
email services to be more secure. The use of IPsec can secure transmissions between
critical servers and clients. Answer A is incorrect because editing the Registry to
restrict anonymous access is a method used to control null session access.
18. Answer: B. Forcing a user to reauthenticate before allowing transactions to occur
could help prevent this type of attack. Protection mechanisms include the use of
unique initial sequence numbers (ISNs) and web session cookies. Answer A is incor-
rect because to mitigate the effects of spoofing, you should set up a filter that denies
traffic originating from the Internet that shows an internal network address. Answers C
and D are incorrect; to mitigate the vulnerability of DDoS attacks, reduce the amount
of time before the reset of an unfinished TCP connection and set up filters on external
routers.
19. Answer: C, D. The most effective way to reduce null session vulnerability is by dis-
abling NetBIOS over TCP/IP. After you have done this, verify that ports 139 and 445
are closed. Answers A and B are incorrect; Simple Network Management Protocol
(SNMP) is often overlooked when checking for vulnerabilities because it uses User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports 161 and 162.
20. Answer: A, B. The man-in-the-middle attack takes place when an attacker intercepts
traffic and then tricks the parties at both ends into believing that they are communicat-
ing with each other. This attack is common in Telnet and wireless technologies.
Answer C is incorrect because email is susceptible to spoofing not hijacking. Answer
D is incorrect. Samba provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients for Linux-
based operating systems.
21. Answer: A, C, D. To minimize the effects of DNS poisoning, check the DNS setup if
you are hosting your own DNS. Be sure the DNS server is not open-recursive. An
open-recursive DNS server responds to any lookup request, without checking where it
originates. Disable recursive access for other networks to resolve names that are not
in your zone files. You can also use different servers for authoritative and recursive
lookups and require that caches discard information except from the .com servers and
the root servers. Answer B is incorrect because it describes an effective way to deal
with rootkits.
22. Answer: A, D. ARP poisoning is limited to attacks that are locally based, so an intrud-
er needs either physical access to your network or control of a device on your local
network. To mitigate ARP poisoning on a small network, you can use static or script-
based mapping for IP addresses and ARP tables. For large networks, use equipment
that offers port security. Answers B and C are incorrect; they are solutions for small
networks, not large networks.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
195
23. Answer: C. Privilege escalation is a vulnerability represented by the accidental or
intentional access to resources not intended for access by the user. Application flaws
can allow a normal user access to administrative functions reserved for privileged
accounts, or to access features of an application reserved for other users. An example
of the latter would be if User A could read User B’s email without specific authoriza-
tion. Answer A is incorrect because it describes default accounts. Answer B is incor-
rect because data transmitted over a wireless network using 802.1x that can be easily
“sniffed” is referred to as data emanations. Answer D is incorrect because a back door
is an application code function, created intentionally or unintentionally, which allows
unauthorized access to networked resources.
24. Answer: D. A back door is an application code function, created intentionally or unin-
tentionally, which allows unauthorized access to networked resources. Answer A is
incorrect because it describes default accounts. Answer B is incorrect because data
transmitted over a wireless network using 802.1x that can be easily “sniffed” is
referred to as data emanations. Answer C is incorrect. Privilege escalation is a vulnera-
bility represented by the accidental or intentional access to resources not intended for
access by the user. Application flaws can allow a normal user access to administrative
functions reserved for privileged accounts, or to access features of an application
reserved for other users. An example of the latter would be if User A could read User
B’s email without specific authorization.
25. Answer: B. Unlike resources located on the local system, network resources are much
more vulnerable to DoS attacks. These attacks attempt to block access to resources by
overwhelming network availability, instead of attempting to directly access the
resources through unauthorized means. By blocking access to a website or network
resource, the attacker effectively prevents authorized availability. Answer A is incorrect
because a DoS focuses on network resources, not local resources. Answer C is incor-
rect; viruses and worms ranked the highest for sheer number of attacks against net-
work storage. Answer D is incorrect; DoS attacks are launched against servers in the
DMZ, not the internal network, unless there is not a DMZ in place. However, corporate
networks usually have some type of segmentation keeping the internal network and
DMZ separated, making this answer choice incorrect.
26. Answer: C. Unlike resources located on the local system, network resources are much
more vulnerable to DoS attacks. These attacks attempt to block access to resources by
overwhelming network availability, instead of attempting to directly access the
resources through unauthorized means. By blocking access to a website or network
resource, the attacker effectively prevents authorized availability. Answer A is incorrect
because privilege escalation is the intentional access to resources not intended for
access by the user. Answer B is incorrect; a back door is an application code function,
created intentionally or unintentionally, which allows unauthorized access to networked
resources. Answer D is incorrect; attempting to directly access the resources through
unauthorized means would fall along the lines of a spoofing attack.
27. Answer: C. Many networking devices and services are initially installed with a default
set of user credentials, such as Oracle’s Scott/Tiger and IBM’s qsecofr/qsecofr. Unless
these credentials are removed and replaced with unique strong logon credentials, they
present an avenue for network attack because they are known to potential attackers.
Answer A is incorrect because replacing them on an as-needed basis is not proper

196
Chapter 3
policy. Answer B is incorrect; replacing them when an attack has been detected is
reactive instead of proactive. Answer D is incorrect because using the same logon 
credential for all devices and services leaves them all vulnerable should the password
be compromised.
28. Answer: A. Back doors are application code functions created intentionally or uninten-
tionally that enable unauthorized access to networked resources. Many times during
application development, software designers put in shortcut entry points to allow rapid
code evaluation and testing. If not removed before application deployment, such entry
points can present the means for an attacker to gain unauthorized access later. Other
back doors may be inserted by the application designers purposefully, presenting later
threats to the network if applications are never reviewed by another application
designer before deployment. Answer B is incorrect because back doors are associated
with code development, not system certification. Answer C is incorrect because during
user interface testing, the users do not have access to the code and cannot create
back doors. Answer D is incorrect because the code has already been developed and
tested during the implementation phase. At this point, there is not access to the code
itself.
29. Answer: D. To optimize network layout within each unique location, a site survey is
necessary before implementing any WLAN solution. This is particularly important in
distributed wireless network configurations spanning multiple buildings or open natu-
ral areas, where imposing structures and tree growth may affect network access in 
key areas. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect. Land surveys, building inspections, and
OSHA inspections are agency-related functions and cannot be conducted by the
organization.
30. Answer: B. Privilege escalation is a vulnerability represented by the accidental or
intentional access to resources not intended for access by the user. Application flaws
can allow a normal user access to administrative functions reserved for privileged
accounts, or to access features of an application reserved for other users. Answer A is
incorrect because it describes the vulnerability of a broadcast packet sniffer readily
identifying a WAP. Answer C is incorrect. Back doors represent application code func-

32. Answer: C. Back doors represent application code functions, created intentionally or
unintentionally, which allow unauthorized access to networked resources. Many times
during application development, software designers put in shortcut entry points to
allow rapid code evaluation and testing. If not removed before application deployment,
such entry points can present the means for an attacker to gain unauthorized access
later. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the vulnerability of a broadcast packet
sniffer readily identifying a WAP. Answer B is incorrect. Privilege escalation is a vulner-
ability represented by the accidental or intentional access to resources not intended for

33. Answer: C. Many networking devices and services are initially installed with a default
set of user credentials, such as Oracle’s Scott/Tiger and IBM’s qsecofr/qsecofr. Unless
these credentials are removed and replaced with unique strong logon credentials, they
present an avenue for network attack. Answer A is incorrect. Network resources are
much more vulnerable to DoS attacks. These attacks attempt to block access to
resources by overwhelming network availability, instead of attempting to directly
access the resources through unauthorized means. Answer B is incorrect. Privilege
escalation is a vulnerability represented by the accidental or intentional access to
resources not intended for access by the user. Application flaws can allow a normal

37. Answer: B, C. Automated and social-engineering assaults on passwords are easier
when a password is short, lacking in complexity (complexity here meaning a mixture
of character case, numbers, and symbols), derived from a common word found in the
dictionary, or derived from easily guessable personal information such as birthdays,
family names, pet names, and similar details. Answer A is incorrect because it is an
attack associated with WAPs announcing their service set identifier (SSID). Answer D
is incorrect because DoS attacks are often used for Internet extortion schemes, where
an attacking botnet of tens of thousands of zombied client systems can be used to
consume all available connections to a business website.

39. Answer: A. Spear phishing is a targeted version of phishing. Whereas phishing often
involves mass email, spear phishing might go after a specific individual.  Answer B is
incorrect because Vishing is voice phishing; the attacker will often use a fake caller-ID
to appear as a trusted organization and attempt to get the individual to enter account
details via the phone. Answer C is incorrect because smishing, also known as SMS
phishing, involves using phishing methods through text messaging. Answer D is
incorrect because pharming redirects victims to a bogus website, even if they correctly
entered the intended site. To accomplish this, the attacker employs another attack
such as DNS cache poisoning.

Chapter 3
44. Answer: D. When used as part of scanning a system, the TCP header of Christmas
tree packets has the flags SYN, FIN, URG and PSH set. By observing how a host
responds to an odd packet, such as a Christmas tree packet, assumptions can be
made regarding the host’s operating system. Answer A is incorrect because spoofing
involves modifying the source address of traffic or source of information.  Answer B is
incorrect because a null session is a connection without specifying a username or
password. Null sessions are a possible security risk because the connection is not
really authenticated. Answer C is incorrect because ARP poisoning allows a perpetra-
tor to trick a device into thinking that an incorrect IP address is related to a MAC
address. The implementation of the ARP protocol is simple. The receipt of an ARP
reply at any time causes the receiving computer to add the newly received information
to its ARP cache without any type of verification.
45. Answer: B. Transitive access can be achieved by gaining the trust of a computer that
is trusted by the target network allowing the bypass of security measures. Answer A is
incorrect because packet sniffing targets packets not hosts. Answer C is incorrect;
Social-engineering attacks target humans, not computers. Answer D is incorrect. DoS
attacks are often used for Internet extortion schemes, where an attacking botnet of
tens of thousands of zombied client systems can be used to consume all available
connections to a business website.
Objective 3.3: Analyze and differentiate
among types of social engineering attacks.
1. Answer: B. Social engineering is a process by which an attacker may extract useful
information from users who are often just tricked into helping the attacker. Answer A
is incorrect because pharming is a hacker’s attack aiming to redirect a website’s traffic
to another, bogus, website. Answer C is incorrect because phishing is an attempt to
acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity via an electronic
communication, usually email. Answer D is incorrect because shoulder surfing uses
direct observation techniques. It gets its name from looking over someone’s shoulder
to get information.
2. Answer: C. Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading

which an attacker may extract useful information from users who are often just tricked
into helping the attacker. Answer D is incorrect because shoulder surfing uses direct
observation techniques. It gets its name from looking over someone’s shoulder. 
3. Answer: B. Hoax messages may warn of emerging threats that do not exist. They
might instruct users to delete certain files to ensure their security against a new virus,
while actually only rendering the system more susceptible to later viral agents. Answer
A is incorrect because pharming is a hacker’s attack aiming to redirect a website’s traf-
fic to another, bogus, website. Answer C is incorrect because phishing is an attempt to

communication, usually email. Answer D is incorrect because spam is unwanted email
communication.
4. Answer: A. Although hoaxes present issues such as loss of functionality or security
vulnerabilities, they also use system resources and consume users’ time. This results
in lost productivity and an undue burden on the organization’s resources, especially if
many employees respond. Answer B is incorrect; although virus may be a concern, the
idea behind a chain letter is to occupy time and resources. Answer C is incorrect
because hoaxes try to occupy time and resources, not garner proprietary information.
Answer D is incorrect because this statement is simply not true.
5. Answer: D. Shoulder surfing uses direct observation techniques. It gets its name from
looking over someone’s shoulder to get information. Shoulder surfing is an effective
way to get information in crowded places such as airports, conventions, or coffee
shops because it’s relatively easy to stand next to someone and watch as the person
enters a PIN or a password. Answer A is incorrect; virus infection is a concern.
However, the real danger is the organizational information that is readily accessible.
Answer B is incorrect because social engineering is a process by which an attacker
may extract useful information from users who are often tricked into helping the
attacker. Answer C is incorrect because dumpster diving is scavenging through dis-
carded equipment and documents and extracting sensitive information from it without
ever contacting anyone in the company.
6. Answer: D. Whaling  is identical to spear phishing except for the “size of the fish.”
Whaling employs spear phishing tactics, but is intended to go after high-profile targets
such as an executive within a company. Answer A is incorrect because spear phishing
is a targeted version of phishing. Whereas phishing often involves mass email, spear
phishing might go after a specific individual.  Answer B is incorrect because vishing is
voice phishing; the attacker will often use a fake caller-ID to appear as a trusted organ-
ization and attempt to get the individual to enter account details via the phone. Answer
C is incorrect because smishing, also known as SMS phishing, involves using phish-
ing methods through text messaging.

“size of the fish.” Whaling employs spear phishing tactics, but is intended to go after
high-profile targets such as an executive within a company. 
9. Answer: C. Dumpster diving is scavenging through discarded equipment and docu-
ments and extracting sensitive information from it without ever contacting anyone in
the company. Answer A is incorrect; virus infection is a technical concern, not a
human concern. Answer B is incorrect because social engineering is a process by
which an attacker may extract useful information from users who are often tricked into
helping the attacker. Answer D is incorrect because shoulder surfing uses direct
observation techniques. It gets its name from looking over someone’s shoulder to get
information. Shoulder surfing is an effective way to get information in crowded places
such as airports, conventions, or coffee shops because it’s relatively easy to stand
next to someone and watch as the person enters a PIN or a password. 
10. Answer: D. Tailgating  refers to the act of tagging along with another person who is
authorized in order to gain entry into a restricted area. Answer A is incorrect because
pharming redirects victims to a bogus website, even if they correctly entered the
intended site. To accomplish this, the attacker employs another attack such as DNS
cache poisoning. Answer B is incorrect because dumpster diving is scavenging
through discarded equipment and documents and extracting sensitive information
from it without ever contacting anyone in the company. Answer C is incorrect because

PIN or a password. 
Objective 3.4: Analyze and differentiate
among types of wireless attacks.
1. Answer: B. Wireless networks often announce their service set identifier (SSID) to
allow mobile devices to discover available Wireless Access Points (WAPs). Turning off
this broadcast can reduce the vulnerability of a wireless packet sniffer detecting broad-
casts that readily identify a WAP. In this particular instance, the WAP is not secure
because the SSID is broadcast in plain text whenever a client connects to the network.
Answer A is incorrect because WAPs by default do not have encryption enabled.
Answer C is incorrect because if physical access is limited, the risk is mitigated.
Answer D is incorrect because it describes the characteristics of a hub.
2. Answer: D. 802.1x transmissions generate detectable radio-frequency signals in all
directions. Persons who want to “sniff” the data transmitted over the network may use
many solutions to increase the distance over which detection is possible, including the
use of reflective tube waveguides. Answer A is incorrect because the radio-frequency
signals are generated in all directions, not in one direction. Answers B and C are incor-
rect because data emanation is what allows for the sniffing of the data, not why data
emanation is a risk.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
203
3. Answer: C. Without the use of a mandated encryption standard, data transmitted over
an 802.1x wireless link may be passed in clear form. Forms of encryption may be
implemented, such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II
(WPA2) and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). Answers A, B, and D are incorrect
because authorization, authentication, and identification are access control methods,
not methods to mitigate data transmissions.
4. Answer: A, B, C. Wireless communications are susceptible to data emanation, weak
encryption, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and war-driving. Answer D is
incorrect because spam relaying is associated with open SMTP relays in email servers.
5. Answer: C. Because the authentication mechanism is one-way, it is easy for a hijacker
to wait until the authentication cycle is completed and then generate a signal to the
client that causes the client to think it has been disconnected from the access point,
while at the same time beginning to transmit data traffic pretending to be from the
original client. Answers A and D are incorrect. Both of these answers deal with author-
ization, and session hijacking deals with authentication. Answer B is incorrect because
it is not true that an authentication mechanism is not there. It exists and is one-way.
6. Answer: D. The request for connection by the client is an omnidirectional open broad-
cast. It is possible for a hijacker to act as an access point to the client, and as a client
to the true network access point, allowing the hijacker to follow all data transactions
with the ability to modify, insert, or delete packets at will. Answer A is incorrect
because a request for connection by the client is an omnidirectional open broadcast.
Answers B and C are incorrect; the connection request is made by the client, not the
access point.
7. Answer: A. A popular pastime involves driving around with a laptop system config-
ured to listen for open 802.1x access points announcing their SSID broadcasts, which
is known as war-driving. Answer B is incorrect because it describes war-dialing.
Answer C is incorrect because it describes war-chalking. Answer D is incorrect
because it describes a hotspot.
8. Answer: C. War-chalking utilizes a set of symbols and shorthand details to provide
specifics needed to connect using a business access point. This is done by marking
buildings, curbs, and other landmarks to indicate the presence of an available access
point and its connection details. Answer A is incorrect. A popular pastime involves
driving around with a laptop system configured to listen for open 802.1x access points
announcing their SSID broadcasts, which is known as war-driving. Answer B is incor-
rect because it describes war-dialing. Answer D is incorrect because it describes a
hotspot.
9. Answer: B. Mobile devices equipped for Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity,
such as laptops, cell phones, and PDAs, are subject to receiving text and message
broadcast spam sent from a nearby Bluetooth-enabled transmitting device in an attack
referred to as bluejacking. Answer A is incorrect. A popular pastime involves driving
around with a laptop system configured to listen for open 802.1x access points
announcing their SSID broadcasts, which is known as war-driving. Answer C is incor-
rect because it describes bluesnarfing. Answer D is incorrect. War-chalking utilizes a
set of symbols and shorthand details to provide specifics needed to connect using a
business access point. This is done by marking buildings, curbs, and other landmarks
to indicate the presence of an available access point and its connection details.

204
Chapter 3
10. Answer: C. Although typically benign, attackers use bluejacking to generate messages
that appear to be from the device itself. This leads users to follow obvious prompts
and establish an open Bluetooth connection to the attacker’s device. Once paired with
the attacker’s device, the user’s data becomes available for unauthorized access, modi-
fication, or deletion, which is an attack referred to as bluesnarfing. Answer B is incor-
rect. Mobile devices equipped for Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity, such as

tion details.
11. Answer: A. The 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard uses the CSMA/CA connectivity methods
commonly found in Ethernet connectivity. Answers B and D are incorrect because both
i-Mode and WAP are standards used by mobile devices such as cell phones, pagers,
and PDAs and are not used to specify WLAN standards. Answer C is incorrect because
Bluetooth is based on a different transmission protocol.
12. Answer: D. Data emanation happens because 802.1x transmissions generate
detectable radio-frequency signals in all directions. Persons wanting to sniff the data
transmitted over the network may use many solutions to increase the distance over
which detection is possible, including the use of reflective tube waveguides (such as
the popular Pringle’s can) and flying devices overhead to increase detection range
without interference from building structures. Answer A is incorrect because without
the use of a mandated encryption standard, data transacted over an 802.1x wireless
link may be passed in clear form, and attackers can take advantage of this weak or
nonexistent encryption. Answer B is incorrect because the wireless authentication
mechanism is one-way, allowing session hijacking. Answer C is incorrect because a
popular pastime involves driving around with a laptop system configured to listen for
open 802.1x access points announcing their SSID broadcasts, which is known as war-
driving.
13. Answer: B. Because the authentication mechanism is one-way, it is easy for a hijacker
to wait until the authentication cycle is completed and then generate a signal to the
client that causes the client to think it has been disconnected from the access point,
while at the same time beginning to transact data traffic pretending to be the original
client. Answer A is incorrect because without the use of a mandated encryption stan-
dard, data transacted over an 802.1x wireless link may be passed in clear form, and
attackers can take advantage of this weak or nonexistent encryption. Answer C is

16. Answer: C. War-driving is aimed at identification of existing wireless networks, the
service set identifier (SSID) used to identify the wireless network, and any known WEP
keys. Answer A is incorrect because without the use of a mandated encryption stan-
dard, data transacted over an 802.1x wireless link may be passed in clear form and

as a client to the true network access point, allowing the hijacker to follow all data
transactions with the ability to modify, insert, or delete packets at will. By implement-
ing a rogue AP with stronger signal strength than more remote permanent installa-
tions, the attacker can cause a wireless client to preferentially connect to their own
stronger nearby connection using the wireless device’s standard roaming handoff
mechanism. Answer A is incorrect. Without the use of a mandated encryption stan-
dard, data transacted over an 802.1x wireless link may be passed in clear form and

19. Answer: D. The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and later WPA2) standards were devel-
oped by the Wi-Fi Alliance to replace the WEP protocol while the 802.11i standard was
being developed. The WPA includes many of the functions of the 802.11i protocol but
relies on the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4), which is considered vulnerable to keystream
attacks. The later WPA2 standard was certified to include the full 802.11i standard
after its final approval. Answers A and C are incorrect because they are encryptions
standards not associated with the Wi-Fi Alliance. Answer B is incorrect because a WAP
refers to both handheld devices as well as wireless access points.

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Based on this information, answers B, C,
and D are incorrect.
Objective 3.5: Analyze and differentiate
among types of application attacks.
1. Answer: A, D. Some identified vulnerabilities of the Java language include buffer over-
flows, ability to execute instructions, resource monopolization, and unexpected redi-
rection. Answers B and C are incorrect because unauthorized file upload and email
exposure are associated with JavaScript, not the Java language.
2. Answer: C. Java applets execute when the client machine’s browser loads the hosting
web page. Vulnerabilities are based on the Java language. JavaScript vulnerabilities
must be addressed based on the operating system and browser version in use on each

207
client. Answers A and B are incorrect because JavaScript vulnerabilities must be
addressed based on the operating system and browser version in use on each client,
not the server. Answer D is incorrect because the operating system does not load the
hosting web page—an application and browser do.
3. Answer: B. Java is a precompiled language. Before it can be executed, it undergoes a
Just In Time (JIT) compilation into the necessary binary bytes. A Java-based minipro-
gram, called an applet, may present many security risks to the client. Applets execute
when the client machine’s browser loads the hosting web page. Answers A and C are
incorrect because Java is a precompiled language. Answer D is incorrect because
applets execute when the client machine’s browser loads the hosting web page.
4. Answer: B, C. JavaScript is a client-side interpreted language that mainly poses priva-
cy-related vulnerability issues such as unauthorized file upload and email exposure.
Answers A and D are incorrect because they are associated with the Java language.
Some identified vulnerabilities of the Java language include buffer overflows, ability to
execute instructions, resource monopolization, and unexpected redirection.
5. Answer: A. To avoid vulnerabilities exposed by earlier forms of Java and ActiveX
development, all machines should be kept up-to-date with new version releases.
Scripting language vulnerabilities may be addressed in this manner, as well as by turn-
ing off or increasing the client’s browser security settings to prevent automatic code
execution. Answer B is incorrect because this setting controls third-party tool bands
and browser helper objects. Answer C is incorrect because increasing the pop-up set-
ting will not mitigate Java vulnerabilities. Answer D is incorrect because Integrated
Windows Authentication has to do with logon information, not Java vulnerabilities.
6. Answer: C. Microsoft developed a precompiled application technology that can be
embedded in a web page in the same way as Java applets. This technology is referred
to as ActiveX, and its controls share many of the same vulnerabilities present in
embedded Java applets. Answer A is incorrect because cookies are temporary files
stored in the client’s browser cache to maintain settings across multiple pages,
servers, or sites. Answer B is incorrect because JavaScript is a smaller language that
does not create applets or standalone applications. Answer D is incorrect because CGI
(Common Gateway Interface) scripts are programs that run on the server to service
client requests.
7. Answer: B. Clients should regularly clear their browser cookie cache to avoid exposing
long-term browsing habits in this way. Where possible, client browsers may also be
configured to block third-party cookies, although many online commerce sites require
this functionality for their operation. Answer A is incorrect because this setting con-
trols third-party tool bands and browser helper objects. Answer C is incorrect because
blocking all cookies would hamper the functionality for many online commerce sites.
Answer D is incorrect because disabling automatic code execution on client browsers
has more to do with Java applets and ActiveX controls.
8. Answer: D. By restricting the data that can be input and using proper input validation,
application designers can reduce the threat posed by maliciously crafted URL refer-
ences and redirected web content. Answer A is incorrect because third-party cookies
would limit exposing long-term browsing habits. Answer B is incorrect because
accepting only numeric data input is not feasible, and if it is not validated, it will not

Chapter 3
mitigate attacks. Answer C is incorrect because this setting controls third-party tool
bands and browser helper objects.
9. Answer: A. Whereas cookies generally provide benefits to the end users, spyware
would be most likely to use a tracking cookie. A tracking cookie is a particular type of
permanent cookie that stays around, whereas a session cookie stays around only for
the particular visit to a website. Answers B and D are incorrect because these sites
would use session cookies, not tracking cookies. Answer C is incorrect because a
Trojan appears to be useful software but has code hidden inside that will attack your
system directly or allow the system to be infiltrated by the originator of the code after
it has been executed.
10. Answer: D. Spammers search for unprotected SMTP relay services running on public
servers, which may then be used to resend SMTP messages to obscure their true
source. Answer A is incorrect because buffer overflows are associated with not using
proper input validation. Answer B is incorrect. A logic bomb is a virus or Trojan horse
designed to execute malicious actions when a certain event occurs or a period of time
goes by. Answer C is incorrect. Spyware is associated with behaviors such as advertis-
ing, collecting personal information, or changing your computer configuration without
appropriately obtaining prior consent.
11. Answer: B. A tracking cookie is a particular type of permanent cookie that stays
around, whereas a session cookie stays around only for the particular visit to a web-
site. Therefore, answer C is incorrect. Answers A and D are incorrect because tracking
cookies are beneficial or valuable only to the tracking party, not the user.
12. Answer: A. Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (S-HTTP) operates over port 80 along
with regular HTTP traffic. Answer B is incorrect because HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) and
SSL employ X.509 digital certificates and operate over port 443. Answer C is incorrect.
Email clients connect to port 110 of a remote email server, and then use the POP3
protocol to retrieve email. Answer D is incorrect. Port 4445 uses TCP/UDP for service
type upnotifyp.
13. Answer: B. HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) and SSL employ X.509 digital certificates and
operate over port 443. Answer A is incorrect because Secure Hypertext Transport
Protocol (S-HTTP) operates over port 80 along with regular HTTP traffic. Answer C is
incorrect. Email clients connect to port 110 of a remote email server, and then use the
POP3 protocol to retrieve email. Port 4445 uses TCP/UDP for service type upnotifyp;
therefore, Answer D is incorrect.
14. Answer: B, C. Malformed certificates may be used to exploit the parsing libraries used
by SSL agents. SSL certificates may also be used to establish links vulnerable to pack-
et sniffing by using compromised self-signed or expired certificates. Other exploits
include the use of small key sizes, outdated certificate revocation lists, and other
mechanisms intended to provide weak or compromised SSL certificates. Answers A
and D are incorrect because they are associated with programming errors. Buffer-
overflow vulnerabilities may be used to enact arbitrary commands on a server. Format
string vulnerabilities may result in unauthorized access to enact commands on a serv-
er or impair its normal operation. Improperly formatted requests may be used to cre-
ate an effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the server, preventing it from
responding to normal requests.

15. Answer: A, D. Buffer-overflow vulnerabilities may be used to enact arbitrary com-
mands on the LDAP server. Format string vulnerabilities may result in unauthorized
access to enact commands on the LDAP server or impair its normal operation.
Improperly formatted requests may be used to create an effective denial-of-service
(DoS) attack against the LDAP server, preventing it from responding to normal
requests. Answers B and C are incorrect because they are associated with SSL certifi-
cate vulnerabilities. Malformed certificates may be used to exploit the parsing libraries
used by SSL agents. SSL certificates may also be used to establish links vulnerable to
packet sniffing by using compromised self-signed or expired certificates. Other
exploits include the use of small key sizes, outdated certificate revocation lists, and
other mechanisms intended to provide weak or compromised SSL certificates.
16. Answer: B, C. FTP servers provide user access to upload or download files between
client systems and a networked FTP server. FTP servers include many potential securi-
ty issues, including anonymous file access and unencrypted authentication. Answers A
and D are incorrect because they are associated with programming errors. Buffer-
overflow vulnerabilities may be used to enact arbitrary commands on a server. Format
string vulnerabilities may result in unauthorized access to enact commands on a serv-
er or impair its normal operation. Improperly formatted requests may be used to cre-
ate an effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the server, preventing it from
responding to normal requests.
17. Answer: A. FTPS (FTP over SSL) using TCP port 21. Answer B is incorrect because
HTTP operates over port 80. Answer C is incorrect. A more secure version of FTP
(S/FTP) has been developed, including SSL encapsulation. This is referred to as FTP
over SSH using the Secure Shell (SSH) TCP port 22. Answer D is incorrect because
port 81 is used as an alternate port for hosting a website.
18. Answer: A, B, C. Attackers develop viral malware capable of spreading through con-
tact lists within IM clients. Others focus on capturing IM traffic and cached logs of
past conversations, in an attempt to obtain useful or harmful information. The file-
transfer and desktop-sharing capabilities of many clients present challenges against
unauthorized data sharing, while creative attackers make use of the audio and video
capabilities to directly “tap” unwary IM users. Answer D is incorrect. Improperly for-
matted requests may be used to create an effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack
against servers, preventing them from responding to normal requests.
19. Answer: A, C. CGI scripts may be exploited to leak information, including details 
about running server processes and daemons. Samples included in some default
installations are not intended for security and include well-known exploits, and buffer
overflows may allow arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. Answer B is
incorrect because anonymous file access is associated with FTP servers. Answer D is
incorrect because CGI scripts do not run on the client system.
20. Answer: D. When a website redirects the client’s browser to attack yet another site,
this is referred to as cross-site scripting. Answer A is incorrect because unencrypted
authentication is associated with FTP servers. Answer B is incorrect because a session
hijack occurs when an attacker causes the client’s browser to establish a secure con-
nection to a compromised web server acting as a proxy or redirecting traffic to a
secure target site, exposing traffic as it passes through the compromised system.
Answer C is incorrect because a buffer overflow occurs when data input exceeds the

210
Chapter 3
memory space allocated and injects unanticipated data or programmatic code into
executable memory.
21. Answer: B. An early exploit of JavaScript allowed access to files located on the client’s
system if the name and path were known. Answers A and D are incorrect because
JavaScript, not Java, can be used to execute arbitrary instructions on the server, send
email as the user, and allow access to cache information. Answer C is incorrect
because Java, not JavaScript, can continue running even after the applet has been
closed.
22. Answer: A. Exploits may allow the identification of configuration details of the server
that may be helpful to later unauthorized access attempts, a process often referred to
as profiling. Answer B is incorrect because reporting portrays information collected in
a particular area. Answer C is incorrect because abstracting is used to understand and
solve problems. Answer D is incorrect because hyperlinking is associated with web
pages.
23. Answer: B. The danger to maintaining session information is that sites may access
cookies stored in the browser’s cache that may contain details on the user’s 
e-commerce shopping habits, along with many user details that could possibly 
include sensitive information identifying the user or allowing access to secured 
sites. Answers A and C are incorrect because these actions prove helpful for the 
client. Answer D is incorrect because this action is associated with Java.
24. Answer: A, C. Browser-based vulnerabilities include session hijacking, buffer over-
flows, cross-site scripting, and add-in vulnerabilities. Answer B is incorrect because
SQL injection is associated with SQL database servers. Answer D is incorrect because
social engineering is taking advantage of human nature.
25. Answer: C. The common BitTorrent file-sharing application is an example of a
resource-sharing peer-to-peer (P2P) solution, allowing users to transport files between
remote clients without passing through a central server for access. This presents diffi-
culties for access restriction because any two clients may negotiate connections using
random ports and protocols, bypassing traffic analysis and access control restrictions.
Answer A is incorrect; it describes a vulnerability exploitation of Java, CGI scripts, and
LDAP. Answer B is incorrect; anonymous file upload is associated with FTP servers.
Answer D is incorrect because it describes a CGI script exploit.
Objective 3.6: Analyze and differentiate
among types of mitigation and deterrent
techniques.
1. Answer: B. Unsecured equipment is vulnerable to social-engineering attacks. It is
much easier for an attacker to walk into a reception area, say she is here to do some
work on the server, and get server access than to get into a physically secured area
with a guest sign-in and sign-out sheet. Brute-force attacks, malware, and rootkits can
be installed or launched without physical access. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are
incorrect.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
211
2. Answer: C. The goal of a physical security policy is to allow only trusted use of
resources via positive identification that the entity accessing the systems is someone
or something that has permission to do so based on the security model the organiza-
tion has chosen. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because only allowing officers,
only what is deemed to be credible users is discretionary, whereas allowing all visitors
will create an unsecure environment.
3. Answer: B, C. In very high-security areas, frosted or painted glass can be used to
eliminate direct visual observation of user actions, and very high-security scenarios
may mandate the use of electromagnetic shielding to prevent remote monitoring of
emissions generated by video monitors, network switching, and system operation.
Answers A and D are incorrect; picket and chain-link fencing should not be used in
high-security areas.
4. Answer: A. Buildings that house sensitive information and systems usually have an
area of cleared land surrounding them. This area is referred to as no-man’s land. The
purpose of this area is to eliminate the possibility of an intruder hiding in the bushes
or behind another building. Answer B is incorrect because it increases the chances of
an intruder hiding. Answer C is incorrect; it describes a mantrap. Answer D is incor-
rect because it describes a wireless lock entry.
5. Answer: C. A mantrap is a holding area between two entry points that gives security
personnel time to view a person before allowing him into the internal building. Answer
A is incorrect because it describes no-man’s land. The purpose of this area is to elimi-
nate the possibility of an intruder hiding in the bushes or behind another building.
Answer B is incorrect because it increases the chances of an intruder hiding. Answer
D is incorrect because it describes a wireless lock entry.
6. Answer: D. A cipher lock has a punch code entry system. A wireless lock is opened by
a receiver mechanism that reads the card when it is held close to the receiver. Based
on this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
7. Answer: A. Video or CCTV cameras should be posted in key locations so that the
entire area is covered. Place cameras near entrances and exits to capture each visitor
who comes in and out of the parking lot. Place cameras strategically so that every area
of the parking lot can be seen by a camera’s field of vision. Answer B is incorrect. If
the parking lot covers a large area, security guard coverage may not be enough.
Answer C is incorrect because a keycard entry point can easily be compromised.
Answer D incorrect because motion detection is not feasible for a parking lot.
8. Answer: A, B, D. External motion detectors can be based on light, sound, infrared, or
ultrasonic technology. Answer C is incorrect because radio-frequency identification
(RFID) is an automatic identification method.
9. Answer: A. Mandatory physical access controls are commonly found in government
facilities and military installations, where users are closely monitored and very restrict-
ed. Because they are being monitored by security personnel and devices, users cannot
modify entry methods or let others in. Answer B is incorrect. In role-based access
methods for physical control, groups of people who have common access needs are
predetermined, and access to different locations is allowed with the same key or swipe
card. Answer C is incorrect. Discretionary physical control to a building or room is
delegated to parties responsible for that building or room. Answer D is incorrect.

212
Chapter 3
Allowing access based on individual needs is both costly and causes extensive admin-
istrative overhead.
10. Answer: B. In role-based access methods for physical control, groups of people who
have common access needs are predetermined, and access to different locations is
allowed with the same key or swipe card. Answer A is incorrect. Mandatory physical
access controls are commonly found in government facilities and military installations,
where users are closely monitored and very restricted. Because they are being moni-
tored by security personnel and devices, users cannot modify entry methods or let
others in. Answer C is incorrect. Discretionary physical control to a building or room
is delegated to parties responsible for that building or room. Answer D is incorrect.
Allowing access based on individual needs is both costly and causes extensive admin-
istrative overhead.
11. Answer: A, B, D. Buildings that house sensitive information and systems usually have
an area of cleared land surrounding them. This area is referred to as no-man’s land. A
building that houses top-secret info would need also require a mantrap and door
access system in addition to a no-man’s land. Answer C is incorrect because a wood-
en fence provides little protection.
12. Answer: D. Video surveillance such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the most
common method of surveillance. The picture is viewed or recorded, but not broadcast.
It was originally developed as a means of security for banks. Answer A is incorrect
because a mantrap is a holding area between two entry points that gives security per-
sonnel time to view a person before allowing him into the internal building. Answer B
is incorrect because security dogs are not a good solution for a bank. Answer C is
incorrect because painted glass is used a method of obscuring views. This it is not a
sufficient method of security for a bank.
13. Answer: C. Motion detectors can alert security personnel of intruders or suspicious
activity on the company’s premises. They can be based on light, sound, infrared, or
ultrasonic technology. These devices must be properly configured because they are
extremely sensitive and can issue false alarms if set too stringently. Answers A and B
are incorrect because they are false statements. Answer D is incorrect; although
motion detectors may be a more expensive solution, the question asks for the main
security concern.
14. Answer: A. The quickest way to tell which ports are open and which services are run-
ning is to do a netstat operation on the machine. Answer B is incorrect; nbtstat
is designed to help troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems. Answer C is
incorrect; ipconfig is used to troubleshoot IP address configuration. Answer D is
incorrect; msconfig is used to configure startup services and on Windows comput-
ers.
15. Answer: D. SNMP is used for monitoring the health of network equipment, computer
equipment, and devices like uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). Answer A is incor-
rect because SubNetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) defines how data is formatted for
transmission and how access to the network is controlled. Answer B is incorrect
because SMTP is used for email. Answer C is incorrect because the Synchronous Data
Link Control (SDLC) protocol was developed by IBM to be used as the Layer 2 of the
SNA hierarchical network.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
213
16. Answer: B, C. The best way to protect the network infrastructure from attacks aimed
at antiquated or unused ports and protocols is to remove any unnecessary protocols
and create Access Control Lists to allow traffic on necessary ports only. By doing so,
you eliminate the possibility of unused and antiquated protocols being exploited, and
you minimize the threat of an attack. Answer A is incorrect. It is not always necessary
to keep protocols installed by default. Answer D is incorrect. Users should never con-
trol what goes in and out of the network.
17. Answer: C. To improve server performance, logs should be stored on a nonsystem
striped or striped/mirrored disk volume. Answer A is incorrect. Storing the log files in
the DMZ is poor practice because the servers located here are generally more vulnera-
ble. Answers B and D are incorrect; storing the log files on the local machine will not
improve performance.
18. Answer: D. Log files should be stored in a centralized repository of an offline volume
or on a standalone computer. Answer A is incorrect; storing the log files on the local
machine will not improve security. Answer B is incorrect. Storing the log files on the
intranet is poor practice as the information is visible and more vulnerable. Answer C is
incorrect. Storing the log files in the DMZ is poor practice because the servers located
here are generally more vulnerable.
19. Answer: C. When implementing an application logging strategy, look for a solution
that uses standard protocols and formats so that analysis is simpler. Therefore,
answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
20. Answer: A, B, D. IIS logs may include information about site visitors and their viewing
habits. They can be used to assess content, identify bottlenecks, or investigate attacks.
Answer C is incorrect. Task Manager is a tool that you can use to end processes.
21. Answer: D. DNS logging may cause performance degradation on the server. It should
be used only for troubleshooting purposes. By enabling DNS debug logging, you can
log all DNS-related information. Based on this information, answers A, B, and C are
incorrect.
22. Answer: D. In UNIX- or Linux-based systems, programs send log entries to the sys-
tem logging daemon, syslogd. Answer A is incorrect because mtools.conf is a configu-
ration file for all the operations. Answers B and C are incorrect; both Msconfig and
Event Viewer are tools used on Windows-based systems.
23. Answer: B, C. You should employ strict access controls on all logging servers. If
allowable, encrypt the log files and store log files on a standalone system. Answer A is
incorrect; it is not good practice to store log files in plain text. Answer D is incorrect;
log files should not be stored on data partitions of individual systems.
24. Answer: B. Task Manager is a tool that you can use to end processes or applications
that get hung up or cause the operating system to become unstable, without having to
reboot the machine. It also gives you an instant view of CPU and memory usage.
Answer A is incorrect because Network Monitor is used to capture network traffic and
generate statistics for creating reports. Answer C is incorrect because Event Viewer
enables you to view certain events that occur on the system. Event Viewer maintains
three log files: one for system processes, one for security information, and one for
applications. Answer D is incorrect because Microsoft’s Performance console is used
for tracking and viewing the utilization of system resources.

214
Chapter 3
25. Answer: C. Authentication and accounting logging is particularly useful for trou-
bleshooting remote-access policy issues. Answer A is incorrect because Internet
Information Services (IIS) logging is designed to be more detailed than the event-
logging or performance-monitoring features of Windows Server operating systems.
The IIS logs can include information such as who has visited your site, what they
viewed, and when the information was viewed last. Answer B is incorrect because 
critical and error level logging is one of the eight logging levels available for Cisco 
logging devices. Answer D is incorrect because authentication and accounting logging
information is used to track remote-access usage and authentication attempts. This
logging is separate from the events recorded in the system event log.
26. Answer: A, C, D. Antivirus software, just like other software applications, usually con-
tains a folder within the application for logging events such as updates, quarantined
viruses, and update history. Answer B is incorrect. Dropped packets are normally
found in router logs.
27. Answer: B. Routing and remote access logging information is used to track remote-
access usage and authentication attempts. This logging is separate from the events
recorded in the system event log. Therefore, Answer D is incorrect. Answer A is 
incorrect; firewall logging will not log remote access and authentication. Answer C 
is incorrect; IIS logging will not log remote access and authentication.
28. Answer: C. Auditing is the process of tracking users and their actions on the network.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes baselining. Answer B is incorrect because it
describes logging. Answer D is incorrect because it describes monitoring.
29. Answer: A, B. Without proper planning and policies, you probably will quickly fill your
log files and hard drives with useless or unused information. The more quickly you fill
up your log files, the more frequently you need to check the logs; otherwise, important
security events may get deleted unnoticed. Answer C is incorrect because log files
should not be stored on user hard drives. Answer D is incorrect. When auditing is not
clear-cut, the workload of the system administrator increases.
30. Answer: B, C. Auditing user privileges is generally a two-step process that involves
enabling auditing within the operating system and then specifying the resources to be
audited. Answer A is incorrect; auditing, not logging, needs to be enabled. Answer D is
incorrect; the log file storage directory is specified, not the audit file directory.
31. Answer: D. Auditing of access use and rights changes should be implemented to 
prevent unauthorized or unintentional access for a guest or restricted user account
access to sensitive or protected resources. Answer A is incorrect; group policy con-
trols access to resources. Answer B is incorrect; retention policies concern data, not
user access. Answer C is incorrect; DHCP deals with the issuing of IP addresses not
access to accounts.
32. Answer: C. It is equally important to audit both failed and successful events because
both may reveal unauthorized access or an unexpected escalation of access rights.
Answers A and B are incorrect because it is important to audit both types of events.
Answer D is incorrect because auditing is an important part of securing the network.

Domain 3.0: Threats and Vulnerabilities
215
33. Answer: B. Logging is the process of collecting data to be used for monitoring and
reviewing purposes. Auditing is the process of verification that normally involves
going through log files; therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect.
Baselining is measuring and rating the performance of a network. Typically, the log
files are frequently inspected, and inspection is not the process of collecting the data;
therefore, answer D is incorrect.
34. Answer: D. Turning on all audit counters for all objects could significantly impact serv-
er performance. Answer A is incorrect; auditing is done in the background and does
not affect user productivity. Answer B is incorrect; if the I/O activity were affected at
all, it would be increased. Answer C is incorrect; as with I/O activity, if there were
change, it would be an increase, not a decrease.
35. Answer: B. In Group Policy, the settings that will actually be applied to an object will
be a combination of all the settings that can affect the object. Answer A is incorrect
because all group policies are applied to the object. Answer C is incorrect; in a univer-
sal group, the policies may be applied from different domains. Answer D is incorrect;
this would apply only if there was not a domain environment.
36. Answer: B. You can use gpresult to see what policy is in effect and to troubleshoot
problems. Answer A is incorrect; you can use gpupdate to refresh policy immediately
and to specify certain options at the command line. Answer C is incorrect; the
Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) tool is used to determine the effective settings on the
computer that you are working from or any other computer in a Windows Server 2008
Active Directory domain. Answer D is incorrect; the Group Policy object is used to cre-
ate group policies.
37. Answer: A. You can use the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) tool to determine the
effective settings on the computer that you are working from or any other computer in
a Windows Server 2008 Active Directory domain. Answer B is incorrect; the Group
Policy object is used to create group policies. Answer C is incorrect; you can use
gpupdate to refresh policy immediately and to specify certain options at the command
line. Answer D is incorrect; the local security settings are used on the local machine
only.
38. Answer: C. Auditing success events in the account management event category can
be used to verify changes that were made to account properties and group properties.
Answer A is incorrect. Auditing success events in the policy change event category will
record success and failure events in the system events. Answer B is incorrect.
Auditing success events in the policy change event category on domain controllers
indicates someone has changed the local security authority (LSA). Answer D is incor-
rect; auditing success events in the logon event category records when each user logs
on to or logs off from the computer.
39. Answer: D. Auditing success events in the logon event category records when each
user logs on to or logs off from the computer. Answer A is incorrect. Auditing success
events in the policy change event category will record success and failure events in
the system events. Answer B is incorrect. Auditing success events in the policy change
event category on domain controllers indicates someone has changed the local securi-
ty authority (LSA). Answer C is incorrect; auditing success events in the account man-
agement event category is used to verify changes that were made to account proper-
ties and group properties.

40. Answer: C. Auditing success events in the account logon event category on domain
controllers is used to verify when users log on to or log off from the domain. Answer
A is incorrect. Auditing success events in the policy change event category will record
success and failure events in the system events. Answer B is incorrect. Auditing suc-
cess events in the policy change event category on domain controllers indicates some-
one has changed the local security authority (LSA). Answer D is incorrect; auditing
success events in the logon event category records when each user logs on to or logs
off from the computer.
Objective 3.7: Implement assessment tools
and techniques to discover security threats
and vulnerabilities.
1. Answer: A. A port-scanning software utility will scan a single machine or a range of IP
addresses, checking for a response on service ports. Answer B is incorrect. A network
mapper is a software utility used to conduct network assessments over a range of IP
addresses. The network mapper compiles a listing of all systems, devices, and net-
work hardware present within a network segment. Answer C is incorrect because a
protocol analyzer is a software utility used on a hub, a switch supervisory port, or in
line with network connectivity to allow the analysis of network communications.
Answer D is incorrect. A vulnerability scanner is a software utility that will scan a
range of IP addresses, testing for the presence of known vulnerabilities in software

5. Answer: D. Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) is intended as an inter-
national language for representing vulnerability information using an XML schema for
expression, allowing tools to be developed to test for identified vulnerabilities in the
OVAL repository. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the Open Systems
Interconnection reference model (OSI model). Answer B is incorrect because it
describes IEEE 802 standards. Answer C is incorrect because it describes the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
6. Answer: A. Within U.S. governmental agencies, vulnerability may be discussed using
the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) sponsored by the Department of
Homeland Security’s National Cyber Security Division (NCSD). Answer B is incorrect

Objective 3.8: Within the realm of vulnera-
bility assessments, explain the proper use
of penetration testing versus vulnerability
scanning.
1. Answer: B. Friendly attacks against a network test the security measures put into
place. Such attacks are referred to as penetration tests or simply “pen tests.” Answer
A and C are incorrect because a vulnerability assessment or a security assessment are
not directed efforts to exploit vulnerabilities in an attempt to gain access to networked
resources. Answer D is incorrect because a compliance test has nothing to do with
penetration testing.

220
Chapter 3
2. Answer: A, C. Penetration tests may cause some disruption to network operations as
a result of the actual penetration efforts conducted. Penetration tests can also make
legitimate attacks by generating false data in intrusion detection systems/intrusion
prevention systems (IDS/IPS). Answers B and D are incorrect; although internal and
external users may be affected, these are not the most serious downsides of penetra-
tion testing.
3. Answer: B, C. Some systems administrators may perform amateur pen tests against
networks in an attempt to prove a particular vulnerability exists or to evaluate the over-
all security exposure of a network. This is a bad practice because it generates false
intrusion data, may weaken the network’s security level, and may be a violation of 
privacy laws, regulatory mandates, or business entity guidelines. Answers A and D are
incorrect because the statements are contrary to the correct answers.
4. Answer: D. Vulnerability assessments may be complemented by directed efforts to
exploit vulnerabilities in an attempt to gain access to networked resources. Penetration
testing includes all of the process in vulnerability assessment plus an important extra
step, which is to exploit the vulnerabilities found in the discovery phase. Based in the
previous information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
5. Answer: A. Penetration tests can also make legitimate attacks by generating false data
in IDS systems, concealing aggression that is otherwise unrelated to the officially
sanctioned penetration test. Answers B and C are incorrect; although they are both
concerns, they are not the main security risk. Answer D is incorrect; penetration test-
ing itself does not weaken the network’s security level; however, amateur pen testing
can.
6. Answer: A. A black box test is conducted with the assessor having no information or
knowledge about the inner workings of the system or knowledge of the source code,
for example. Answer B is incorrect because white box testing, also called clear box or
glass box, provides more transparency. White box techniques are often tests to see if
programming constructs are placed correctly and carry out the required actions or
not. Answer C is incorrect because gray box testing uses a combination of both white
and black box techniques. This can be more easily thought of as being translucent.
Answer D is incorrect because green box testing is a testing process that takes multi-
ple integrated systems that have passed system testing as input and tests their
required interactions.
7. Answer: B. White box testing, also called clear box or glass box, provides transparen-
cy. White box techniques are often tests to see if programming constructs are placed
correctly and carry out the required actions or not. Answer A is incorrect because
black box testing is conducted with the assessor having no information or knowledge
about the inner workings of the system or knowledge of the source code for example.
Answer C is incorrect because gray box testing uses a combination of both white 
and black box techniques. This can be more easily thought of as being translucent.

8. Answer: B. A network mapper is a software utility used to conduct network assess-
ments over a range of IP addresses. The network mapper compiles a listing of all 
systems, devices, and network hardware present within a network segment. Answer A
is incorrect. A port-scanning software utility will scan a single machine or a range of
IP addresses, checking for a response on service ports. Answer C is incorrect because
a protocol analyzer is a software utility used on a hub, a switch supervisory port, or in
line with network connectivity to allow the analysis of network communications.
Answer D is incorrect. A vulnerability scanner is a software utility that will scan a
range of IP addresses, testing for the presence of known vulnerabilities in software
configuration and accessible services.
9. Answer: C. A password cracker is a software utility that allows direct testing of user
logon password strength by conducting a brute-force password test using dictionary
terms, specialized lexicons, or mandatory complexity guidelines. Answer A is incor-
rect. Password Locker is a commercial program that lets you save passwords, recover
passwords, and manage and form-fill all your usernames and passwords. Answer B is
incorrect because a password generator creates random passwords. Answer D is
incorrect. A password keychain, most commonly found on Apple computers, keeps
track of your passwords for any type of account.
10. Answer: A. Unlike port scanners, which test only for the availability of services, 
vulnerability scanners may check for the particular version or patch level of a service
to determine its level of vulnerability. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because they
do not accurately describe port scanners or vulnerability scanners.

Domain 4.0:
Application, Data, and
Host Security
Application, data, and host security become the major focus of
security as we move to a more web-based world and exploits
such as cross-site scripting and SQL injections are an everyday
occurrence. Web-based applications and database servers con-
tain a wealth of valuable data. Internally, application servers
store a wide variety of data from web pages to critical data and
sensitive information. Regulatory compliance issues make it
necessary to have sound procedures in place for the security of
applications, data, and hosts. Domain 4 of the Security+ exam
requires that you are familiar with securing host systems,
applications, and organizational data. To secure devices, you
must also understand the basic concepts of encryption and
how data is stored. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to
review all these concepts. The following list identifies the key
areas from Domain 4.0 (which counts as 16% of the exam) that
you need to master:
. Explain the importance of application security
. Carry out appropriate procedures to establish host
security
. Explain the importance of data security

Answers and Explanations
Objective 4.1: Explain the importance of
application security.
1. Answer: A. In some closed application instances, fuzzing may be the only means of
reviewing the security quality of the program. Answer B is incorrect because cross-site
scripting (XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s session or to cause the
user accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack Site B on behalf of the
attacker who planted code on Site A. C is incorrect because input validation tests
whether an application properly handles input from a source outside the application
destined for internal processing. Answer D is incorrect because Cross-site Request
Forgery (XSRF) is an attack in which the end user executes unwanted actions on a
web application while the user is currently authenticated.
2. Answer: D. Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) is an attack in which the end user exe-
cutes unwanted actions on a web application while the user is currently authenticated.
Answer A is incorrect because a buffer overflow is a direct result of poor or incorrect
input validation or mishandled exceptions. Answer B is incorrect because input valida-
tion errors are a result of improper field checking in the code. Answer C is incorrect
because cross-site scripting (XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s ses-
sion or to cause the user accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack Site
B on behalf of the attacker who planted code on Site A. 
3. Answer: B. To mitigate Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks, the most common
solution is to add a token for every POST or GET request that is initiated from the
browser to the server. Answer A is incorrect because buffer overflows are associated
with input validation. Answer C is incorrect because setting the HTTPOnly flag on the
session cookie is used to mitigate XXS attacks. Answer D is incorrect because input
validation tests whether an application properly handles input from a source outside
the application destined for internal processing.
4. Answers: A, D. A buffer overflow is direct result of poor or incorrect input validation
or mishandled exceptions, and input validation errors are a result of improper field
checking in the code. Answer B is incorrect because Cross-site Request Forgery
(XSRF) is an attack in which the end user executes unwanted actions on a web appli-
cation while the user is currently authenticated. Answer C is incorrect because cross-
site scripting (XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s session or to cause
the user accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack Site B on behalf of
the attacker who planted code on Site A. 
5. Answer: A. Anonymous access to share files of questionable or undesirable content
should be limited for proper FTP server security. Answer B is incorrect because it is a
hardening practice for DHCP services. Answers C and D are incorrect because they are
associated with hardening DNS service. 
6. Answer: B. Regular review of networks for unauthorized or rogue servers is a practice
used to harden DHCP services. Answer A is incorrect because anonymous access to

251
share files of questionable or undesirable content should be limited for proper FTP
server security. Answers C and D are incorrect because they are associated with hard-
ening DNS servers.
7. Answer: B. The key element to understanding XSRF is that attackers are betting that
users have a validated login cookie for the website already stored in their browser. All
they need to do is get that browser to make a request to the website on their behalf.
This can be done by either convincing the users to click an HTML page the attacker
has constructed or insert arbitrary HTML in a target website that the users visit.
Answer A is incorrect because a buffer overflow is a direct result of poor or incorrect
input validation or mishandled exceptions. Answer C is incorrect because cross-site
scripting (XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s session or to cause the
user accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack Site B on behalf of the
attacker who planted code on Site A. Answer D is incorrect because input validation
errors are a result of improper field checking in the code.
8. Answer: C. Cross-site scripting (XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s
session or to cause the user accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack
Site B on behalf of the attacker who planted code on Site A. Answer A is incorrect
because a buffer overflow is direct result of poor or incorrect input validation or mis-
handled exceptions. Answer B is incorrect. The key element to understanding XSRF is
that attackers are betting that users have a validated login cookie for the website
already stored in their browser. Answer D is incorrect because input validation errors
are a result of improper field checking in the code.
9. Answer: B. The key element to understanding XSRF is that attackers are betting that
users have a validated login cookie for the website already stored in their browser.
Answer A is incorrect because a buffer overflow is direct result of poor or incorrect
input validation or mishandled exceptions. Answer C is incorrect. Cross-site scripting
(XXS) vulnerabilities can be used to hijack the user’s session or to cause the user
accessing malware-tainted Site A to unknowingly attack Site B on behalf of the attack-
er who planted code on Site A. Answer D is incorrect because input validation errors
are a result of improper field checking in the code.
10. Answer: B. Proactive patch management is necessary to keep your technology envi-
ronment secure and reliable. Answer A is incorrect because application baselining is
similar to operating system baselining in that it provides a reference point for normal
and abnormal activity. Answer C is incorrect because network monitoring is used to
check network activity. Answer D is incorrect because input validation errors are a
result of improper field checking in the code.
11. Answer: D. It is important that security is implemented from the very beginning. In the
early design phase, potential threats to the application must be identified and
addressed.  Ways to reduce the associated risks must also be taken into considera-
tion. Therefore answers A,B, and C are incorrect.
12. Answer: C. Input validation tests whether an application properly handles input from a
source outside the application destined for internal processing. Answer A is incorrect
because fuzzing allows an attacker to inject random-looking data into a program to see
if it can cause the program to crash. Answer B is incorrect because testing is a generic
term that encompasses more than what the question is asking. Answer D is incorrect
because it is a method used to mitigate Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks.

252
Chapter 4
13. Answer: B. In protocol fuzzing, forged packets are sent to the tested application,
which can act as a proxy and modify requests on-the-fly, then replay them. Answer A
is incorrect because in application fuzzing, attack vectors are within its I/O, such as the
user interface, the command-line options, URLs, forms, user-generated content, and
RPC requests. Answer C is incorrect because in file format fuzzing, multiple mal-
formed samples are generated and then opened sequentially. Answer D is incorrect
because web page fuzzing is not a real term.
14. Answer: C. Hardening efforts for data repositories must address security of the stor-
age and backup of storage area networks (SANs), network access server (NAS) con-
figurations, and directory services such as Microsoft Active Directory and Novell
eDirectory. Answer A is incorrect because it is associated with FTP server security.
Answers B and D are incorrect because they are associated with hardening DNS serv-
ices.
15. Answer: A, B, D. The three basic areas of hardening are operating system, application,
and network. Answer C is incorrect because the Internet is a shared public network
and is not hardened.
16. Answer: A, B. Operating system hardening includes encrypted file support and
secured file system selection that allows the proper level of access control. Application
hardening includes default application administration accounts and standard pass-
words. Common services installed by default should also be reviewed and changed or
disabled as required. Answer C is incorrect because the Internet is a shared public net-
work and is not hardened. Answer D is incorrect because network hardening involves
access restrictions to network services, updates to security hardware and software,
and disabling unnecessary protocol support and services.
17. Answer: D. Network hardening involves access restrictions to network services,
updates to security hardware and software, and disabling unnecessary protocol sup-
port and services. Answer A is incorrect; operating system hardening includes
encrypted file support and secured file system selection that allows the proper level of
access control. Answer B is incorrect; application hardening includes default applica-
tion administration accounts and standard passwords Common services installed by
default should also be reviewed and changed or disabled as required. Answer C is
incorrect because the Internet is a shared public network and is not hardened.
18. Answer: A, B. Operating system hardening includes encrypted file support and
secured file system selection. This allows the proper level of access control and allows
you to address newly identified exploits and apply security patches, hotfixes, and serv-
ice packs. Application hardening includes default application administration accounts
and standard passwords. Common services installed by default should also be
reviewed and changed or disabled as required. Applications must be maintained in an
updated state through the regular review of hotfixes, patches, and service packs.
Answer C is incorrect because the Internet is not a shared public network and is not
hardened. Answer D is incorrect because network hardening involves access restric-
tions to network shares and services, updates to security hardware and software, and
disabling unnecessary protocol support and services.

19. Answer: D. Mapping avenues of access is critical in hardening a network. This
process is a part of the site survey that should be performed for any network, espe-
cially those that involve public areas where a simple connection through a workstation
might link the protected internal network directly to a public broadband connection.
Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they are part of operating system harden-
ing.
20. Answer: B. Hotfixes are, typically, small and specific-purpose updates that alter the
behavior of installed applications in a limited manner. These are the most common
type of update. A hotfix is related to a service pack and should be deployed with this in
mind. Answer A is incorrect because service packs are major revisions of functionality
or service operation in an installed application. Service packs are the least common
type of update, often requiring extensive testing to ensure against service failure in
integrated network environments before application. Answer C is incorrect because
patches are similar to hotfixes; security patches eliminate security vulnerabilities. They
may be mandatory if the circumstances match and need to be deployed quickly.
Answer D is incorrect because maintenance releases are incremental updates between
service packs or software versions to fix multiple outstanding issues.
21. Answer: A. Service packs are major revisions of functionality or service operation in
an installed application or operating system. Service packs are the least common type
of update, often requiring extensive testing to ensure against service failure in integrat-
ed network environments before application. Answer B is incorrect because hotfixes
are, typically, small and specific-purpose updates that alter the behavior of installed
applications in a limited manner. These are the most common type of update. Answer
C is incorrect because patches are similar to hotfixes; patches are typically focused
updates that affect installed applications. Security patches eliminate security vulnera-
bilities. They may be mandatory if the circumstances match and need to be deployed
quickly. Answer D is incorrect because maintenance releases are incremental updates
between service packs or software versions to fix multiple outstanding issues.
22. Answer: C. Patches are similar to hotfixes; patches typically focus on updates that
affect installed applications. Security patches eliminate security vulnerabilities. They
may be mandatory if the circumstances match and need to be deployed quickly.
Answer A is incorrect because service packs are major revisions of functionality or
service operation in an installed application. Service packs are the least common type
of update, often requiring extensive testing to ensure against service failure in integrat-
ed network environments before application. Answer B is incorrect; hotfixes are, typi-
cally, small and specific-purpose updates that alter the behavior of installed applica-
tions in a limited manner. These are the most common type of update. Answer D is
incorrect because maintenance releases are incremental updates between service
packs or software versions to fix multiple outstanding issues.
23. Answer: B, C. In application hardening, default application administration accounts,
standard passwords, and common services installed by default should also be
reviewed and changed or disabled as required. Answer A is incorrect because key
management has to do with certificates. Answer D is incorrect because behavior-based
profiles are associated with intrusion detection.

254
Chapter 4
24. Answer: C. It is also imperative to include regular update reviews for all deployed
operating systems, to address newly identified exploits and apply security patches,
hotfixes, and service packs. Answer A is incorrect; update reviews will not reveal com-
promised administrative accounts. Answer B is incorrect because behavior-based pro-
files are associated with intrusion detection. Answer D is incorrect. Firmware updates
have to do with hardware, not operating systems.
25. Answer: B. IP Security (IPsec) and public key infrastructure (PKI) implementations
must be properly configured and updated to maintain key and ticket stores. Some sys-
tems may be hardened to include specific levels of access, gaining the C2 security rat-
ing required by many government deployment scenarios. Answer A is incorrect
because behavior-based profiles are associated with intrusion detection. It is also
imperative to include regular update reviews for all deployed operating systems, to
address newly identified exploits and apply security patches, hotfixes, and service
packs. Answer C is incorrect; regular update reviews for all deployed operating sys-
tems will address newly identified exploits as well as application of security patches,
hotfixes, and service packs. Answer D is incorrect. IPsec and PKI have nothing to do
with isolating access attempts.
26. Answer: B, C, D. Operating system hardening includes configuring log files and audit-
ing, changing default administrator account names and default passwords, and the
institution of account lockout and password policies to guarantee strong passwords
that can resist brute-force attacks. File-level security and access control mechanisms
serve to isolate access attempts within the operating system environment. Answer A is
incorrect because regularly reviewing applied firmware updates and applying those
that are required for the network configuration and hardware solutions in use are
associated with network hardening practices.
27. Answer: A, B, D. Network hardening practices include configuring log files, auditing,
and configuring network devices and firewalls to exclude unsecure protocols, such as
raw Telnet sessions that transfer logon and session details in plain-text format.
Routing hardware must also be maintained in a current state by regularly reviewing
applied firmware updates and applying those that are required for the network config-
uration and hardware solutions in use. Answer C is incorrect because securing the file
system is an operating system hardening activity.
28. Answer: A. Mapping avenues of access is critical in hardening a network. This process
is a part of the site survey that should be performed for any network, especially those
that involve public areas where a simple connection through a workstation might link
the protected internal network directly to a public broadband connection. Wireless net-
works also create significant avenues for unsecure access to a secured network. A
user who configures a PC card on his workstation to allow synchronization of his
802.11-compliant wireless PDA may have inadvertently bypassed all security sur-
rounding an organization’s network. Answer B is incorrect; hardware-related vulnera-
bilities are associated with network hardening practices. Answer C is incorrect; hard-
ware-related vulnerabilities are associated with operating system hardening practices.
Answer D is incorrect; access control is associated with operating system hardening
practices.

29. Answer: B. Regular log review is critical for web servers to ensure that submitted URL
values are not used to exploit unpatched buffer overruns or to initiate other forms of
common exploits. Answer A is incorrect. Email service hardening includes preventing
SMTP relay from being used by spammers, and limiting attachment and total storage
per user to prevent denial-of-service attacks using large file attachments. Answer C is
incorrect. Because of limitations in FTP, unless an encapsulation scheme is used
between the client and host systems, the logon and password details are passed in
cleartext and may be subject to interception by packet sniffing. Answer D is incorrect.
Unauthorized DNS zone transfers should also be restricted to prevent DNS poisoning
attacks.
30. Answer: A. Email service hardening includes preventing SMTP relay from being used
by spammers and limiting attachment and total storage per user to prevent denial-of-
service attacks using large file attachments. Answer B is incorrect. Regular log review
is critical for web servers to ensure that submitted URL values are not used to exploit
unpatched buffer overruns or to initiate other forms of common exploits. Answer C is
incorrect. Because of limitations in FTP, unless an encapsulation scheme is used
between the client and host systems, the logon and password details are passed in
cleartext and may be subject to interception by packet sniffing. Answer D is incorrect.
Unauthorized DNS zone transfers should also be restricted to prevent DNS poisoning
attacks.
31. Answer: C. Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) servers providing user access to
newsgroup posts raise many of the same security considerations risks as email
servers. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect. Access control for newsgroups may be
somewhat more complex, with moderated groups allowing public anonymous submis-
sion (and authenticated access required for post approval). This type of control is not
addressed with database, DNS, or DHCP servers.
32. Answer: D. Query results that are forged and returned to the requesting client or
recursive DNS query can poison the DNS records. Answer A is incorrect. Email service
hardening includes preventing SMTP relay from being used by spammers and limiting
attachment and total storage per user to prevent denial-of-service attacks using large
file attachments. Answer B is incorrect. Regular log review is critical for web servers
to ensure that submitted URL values are not used to exploit unpatched buffer overruns
or to initiate other forms of common exploits. Answer C is incorrect. Because of limi-
tations in the FTP protocol, unless an encapsulation scheme is used between the client
and host systems, the logon and password details are passed in cleartext and may be
subject to interception by packet sniffing.
33. Answer: C. FTP logs should be spot-checked for password-guessing and brute-force
attacks. Because of limitations in FTP, unless an encapsulation scheme is used
between the client and host systems, the logon and password details are passed in
cleartext and may be subject to interception by packet sniffing. Answer A is incorrect.
Email service hardening includes preventing SMTP relay from being used by spam-
mers and limiting attachment and total storage per user to prevent denial-of-service
attacks using large file attachments. Answer B is incorrect. Regular log review is criti-
cal for web servers to ensure that submitted URL values are not used to exploit
unpatched buffer overruns or to initiate other forms of common exploits. Answer D is
incorrect. Unauthorized DNS zone transfers should also be restricted to prevent DNS
poisoning attacks.

34. Answer: D. Print servers pose several risks, including possible security breaches in
the event that unauthorized parties access cached print jobs or sensitive printed mate-
rial. DoS attacks may be used to disrupt normal methods of business, and network-
connected printers require authentication of access to prevent attackers from generat-
ing printed memos, invoices, or any other manner of printed materials. Answer A is
incorrect. Email service hardening includes preventing SMTP relay from being used by
spammers and limiting attachment and total storage per user to prevent denial-of-
service attacks using large file attachments. Answer B is incorrect. Because of limita-
tions in FTP, unless an encapsulation scheme is used between the client and host sys-
tems, the logon and password details are passed in cleartext and may be subject to
interception by packet sniffing. Answer C is incorrect. If the operating system in use
does not support DHCP server authentication, attackers may also configure their own
DHCP servers within a subnet, taking control of the network settings of clients and
obtaining leases from these rogue servers.
35. Answer: B. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers share many of the
same security problems associated with other network services, such as DNS servers.
DHCP servers may be overwhelmed by lease requests if bandwidth and processing
resources are insufficient. Answer A is incorrect because data repositories of any type
might require specialized security considerations. Answers C and D are incorrect.
Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) servers providing user access to newsgroup
posts raise many of the same security considerations risks as email servers.
36. Answer: A, B, C. Data repositories of any type might require specialized security con-
siderations, based on the bandwidth and processing resources required to prevent
DoS attacks, removal of default password and administration accounts such as the
SQL default sa account, and security of replication traffic to prevent exposure of
access credentials to packet sniffing. Answer D is incorrect because lease require-
ments are associated with DHCP servers.
37. Answer: B. Network file shares are not secure until you remove default access permis-
sions. Answer A is incorrect; scope address pools have to do with DHCP servers.
Answer C is incorrect because proper name resolution is associated with DNS servers.
Answer D is incorrect. The password is not encrypted in many network file-sharing
systems.
38. Answer: C. If the operating system in use does not support DHCP server authentica-
tion, attackers may also configure their own DHCP servers within a subnet, taking
control of the network settings of clients and obtaining leases from these rogue
servers. Answer A is incorrect. Email service hardening includes preventing SMTP
relay from being used by spammers and limiting attachment and total storage per user
to prevent denial-of-service attacks using large file attachments. Answer B is incorrect.
Because of limitations in FTP, unless an encapsulation scheme is used between the
client and host systems, the logon and password details are passed in cleartext and
may be subject to interception by packet sniffing. Answer D is incorrect. Unauthorized
zone transfers are associated with DNS attacks.
39. Answer: A, B. Data repositories of any type might require specialized security consid-
erations based on the bandwidth and processing resources required. Role-based
access control may be used to improve security, and the elimination of unneeded con-
nection libraries and character sets may help to alleviate common exploits. Answers C

and D are incorrect; using discretionary-based access control and eliminating band-
width restrictions would relax security, not improve it.
40. Answer: A. Group Policy can be used for ease of administration in managing the envi-
ronment of users. This can include installing software and updates or controlling what
appears on the desktop based on the user’s job function and level of experience. The
Group Policy object (GPO) is used to apply Group Policy to users and computers.
Answer B is incorrect because User Account Control is used primarily to decrease
exposure to unauthorized changes to the operating system. Answers C and D are
incorrect because Active Directory and Directory services store information and set-
tings in a central database.
Objective 4.2: Carry out appropriate proce-
dures to establish host security.
1. Answer: C. A host intrusion prevention system software resides between your sys-
tem’s applications and OS kernel. A HIPS consists of software that sits between your
system’s applications and OS kernel. The HIPS will monitor suspicious activity; then it
will either block or allow the activity based on the predefined rule set. Therefore,
answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
2. Answer: C. The most common method used in an antivirus program is scanning.
Scanning searches files in memory, the boot sector, and on the hard disk for identifi-
able virus code. Scanning identifies virus code based on a unique string of characters
known as a signature. Answers A and B are incorrect. A host intrusion detection sys-
tem uses either misuse detection or anomaly detection. Answer D is incorrect because
filtering is associated with antispam programs.
3. Answer: D. The main component of antispam software is heuristic filtering. Heuristic
filtering has a predefined rule set that compares incoming email information against
the rule set. Answers A and B are incorrect. A host intrusion detection system uses
either misuse detection or anomaly detection. Answer C is incorrect because scanning
is associated with antivirus programs.
4. Answer: C. The most common method used in an antivirus program is scanning.
Scanning searches files in memory, the boot sector, and on the hard disk for identifi-
able virus code. Scanning identifies virus code based on a unique string of characters
known as a signature. Answer A is incorrect because behavior patterns are associated
with intrusion detection systems. Answers B and D are incorrect because antivirus
software does not base its technologies on Registry keys or commands. It will scan
Registry keys, but the technology is based on a unique set of characters to identify
malware.
5. Answer: A, D. If all pop-ups are blocked, the user might not be able to install applica-
tions or programs. Field help for fill-in forms is often in the form of a pop-up. Some
pop-up blockers may delete the information already entered by reloading the page,
causing the users unnecessary grief. Answer B is incorrect because firewalls are not
affected by pop-up blocker settings. Answer C is incorrect because the answer is
associated with email lists.

258
Chapter 4
6. Answer: B. Heuristic scanning looks for instructions or commands that are not typi-
cally found in application programs. Answer A is incorrect because it describes rootkit
software. Answer C is incorrect because it describes antivirus scanning software.
Answer D is incorrect because it describes firewall software.
7. Answer: B, C. Heuristic scanning looks for instructions or commands that are not typ-
ically found in application programs. The issue with these methods is that they are
susceptible to false positives and cannot identify new viruses until the database is
updated. Answers A and D are incorrect. Buffer overflows and logic bombs are mal-
ware that have nothing to do with heuristic scanning methods.
8. Answer: A. A false positive occurs when the software classifies an action as a possible
intrusion when it is actually a nonthreatening action. Answer B is incorrect because it
describes antivirus scanning software. Answer C is incorrect because it describes a
false negative. Answer D is incorrect because the end result is a false negative.
9. Answer: D. When antispam software and updates are installed on a central server and
pushed out to the client machines, this is called a centralized solution. When the
updates are left up to the individual users, you have a decentralized environment.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes a centralized solution. Answer B is incor-
rect. Vendors are never responsible for updating applications on client machines.
Answer C is incorrect because making the manager responsible for the updates is not
necessarily a decentralized solution.
10. Answer: B, D. Specific spam filtering levels can be set on the user’s email account. If
the setting is high, more spam will be filtered, but it may also filter legitimate email as
spam, thus causing false positives. Therefore, answers A and C are incorrect because
they depict just the opposite.
11. Answer: A. In general, an email address added to the approved list is never consid-
ered spam. This is also known as a white list. Using white lists allows more flexibility
in the type of email you receive. Putting the addresses of your relatives or friends in
your white list allows you to receive any type of content from them. An email address
added to the blocked list is always considered spam. This is also known as a blacklist.
Answer B is incorrect. Blacklisting is blocking an email address. Answer C is incorrect.
Graylisting is related to white listing and blacklisting. What happens is that each time a
given mailbox receives an email from an unknown contact (IP), that mail is rejected
with a “try again later.” Answer D is incorrect because brownlisting is a concept based
on a CBL type system driven by tokens from blocked sites.
12. Answer: B. In general, an email address added to the approved list is never consid-
ered spam. This is also known as a white list. Using white lists allows more flexibility
in the type of email you receive. Putting the addresses of your relatives or friends in
your white list allows you to receive any type of content from them. An email address
added to the blocked list is always considered spam. This is also known as a blacklist.
Answer A is incorrect. White listing is allowing an email address. Answer C is incor-
rect. Graylisting is related to whitelisting and blacklisting. What happen is that each
time a given mailbox receives an email from an unknown contact (IP), that mail is
rejected with a “try again later.” Answer D is incorrect because brownlisting is a con-
cept based on a CBL type system driven by tokens from blocked sites.

13. Answer: A, C, D. Although some pop-ups are helpful, many are an annoyance, and
others can contain inappropriate content or entice the user to download malware.
Answer B is incorrect because it describes pop-up blockers, not pop-ups.
14. Answer: A, B, C. Many pop-up blockers are integrated into vendor toolbars. You can
circumvent pop-up blockers in various ways. Most pop-up blockers block only the
JavaScript; therefore, technologies such as Flash bypass the pop-up blocker. On many
Internet browsers, holding down the Ctrl key while clicking a link will allow it to
bypass the pop-up filter. Answer D is incorrect because users can adjust the settings
on pop-up blockers.
15. Answer: B. Set the software to medium so that it will block most automatic pop-ups
but still allow functionality. Keep in mind that you can adjust the settings on pop-up
blockers to meet the organizational policy or to best protect the user environment.
Answer A is incorrect because it will allow most pop-ups. Answer C is incorrect
because it will affect functionality. Answer D is incorrect because the custom setting is
not needed.
16. Answer: C. There are several variations of pop-up windows. A pop-under ad opens a
new browser window under the active window. These types of ads often are not seen
until the current window is closed. They are essentially “floating pop-ups” in a web
page. Answers A and B are incorrect because they describe useful pop-ups and are
not ads. Answer D is incorrect because it describes a hover ad. Hover ads are
Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML) pop-ups.
17. Answer: D. There are several variations of pop-up windows. A pop-under ad opens a
new browser window under the active window. These types of ads often are not seen
until the current window is closed. Hover ads are Dynamic Hypertext Markup
Language (DHTML) pop-ups. They are essentially “floating pop-ups” in a web page.
Answers A and B are incorrect because they describe useful pop-ups and are not ads.
Answer C is incorrect because it describes a pop-under ad.
18. Answer: C. It is important to understand that the spam filter software cannot assign
meaning to the words examined. It just tracks and compares the words used. Answer
A is incorrect because chances are there is nothing wrong with the software. Answer B
is incorrect because adjusting the settings may cause legitimate email to be filtered.
Answer D is incorrect because chances are there is nothing wrong with the software.
Training the software to recognize spam takes time and often the process must be
repeated.
19. Answer: A. Heuristic filtering has a predefined rule set that compares incoming email
information against the rule set. The software reads the contents of each message and
compares the words in that message against the words in typical spam messages.
Each rule assigns a numeric score to the probability of the message being spam. This
score is then used to determine whether the message meets the acceptable level set.
Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because heuristic filtering is not based on character
sets, commands, or Registry keys.
20. Answer: B. Scanning identifies virus code based on a unique string of characters
known as a signature. Answer A is incorrect because heuristic filtering has a prede-
fined rule set that compares incoming email information against the rule set. Answer C

Chapter 4
is incorrect because a misnomer has nothing to do with security. Answer D is incor-
rect. Anomaly detection is associated with a HIDS.
21. Answer: A, C, D. Security baselines are often established by governmental mandate,
regulatory bodies, or industry representatives, such as the PCI requirements estab-
lished by the credit card industry for businesses collecting and transacting credit
information. Answer B is incorrect because organizational requests are merely
requests, and security baselines are often established due to some type of regulation
or standard.
22. Answer: A. Security cables with combination locks can provide such security and are
easy to use. They are used mostly to secure laptops and leave the equipment exposed.
Answer B is incorrect because secure tower and server cages such as PC Safe are
designed to bolt to the floor and are made for use in a static environment. Answer C is
incorrect because a locked cabinet is an alternative for equipment that is not used or
does not have to be physically accessed on a regular, daily basis. Vendors provide
solutions such as security cabinet locker that secures CPU towers. The housing is
made of durable, heavy duty steel for strength. D is incorrect because a hardware lock
is used for license enforcement.
23. Answer: C. A locked cabinet is an alternative for equipment that is not used or does
not have to be physically accessed on a regular, daily basis. Vendors provide solutions
such as security cabinet locker that secures CPU towers. The housing is made of
durable, heavy duty steel for strength. A is incorrect because security cables with
combination locks can provide such security and are easy to use but are used mostly
to secure laptops and leave the equipment exposed. D is incorrect because PC Safe
tower and server cages are designed to bolt to the floor and are meant to be in an
environment that is static. D is incorrect because a hardware lock is used for license
enforcement. 
24. Answer: B. PC Safe tower and server cages are designed to bolt to the floor and are
meant to be in an environment that is static. For example, financial businesses have
been hit hard by theft of desktop computers because they hold a lot of personal data.
Answer A is incorrect. Security cables with combination locks can provide such secu-
rity, are easy to use, and are used mostly to secure laptops and leave the equipment
exposed. Answer C is incorrect because a locked cabinet is an alternative for equip-
ment that is not used or does not have to be physically accessed on a regular, daily
basis.  Vendors provide solutions such as a security cabinet locker that secures CPU
towers. The housing is made of durable, heavy duty steel for strength. D is incorrect
because a hardware lock is used for license enforcement. 
25. Answer: D. Hardening of the operating system includes planning against both acci-
dental and directed attacks, such as the use of fault-tolerant hardware and software
solutions. In addition, it is important to implement an effective system for file-level
security, including encrypted file support and secured file system selection that allows
the proper level of access control. Answer A is incorrect because it is a host protection
measure, not an OS hardening measure. Answer B is incorrect because this is a fea-
ture associated with data security, not host hardening. Answer C is incorrect because
this is a secure communication measure.

26. Answer: A. Virtualization adds a layer of security as well as improves enterprise desk-
top management and control with faster deployment of desktops and fewer support
calls due to application conflicts.  Answer B is incorrect because network storage poli-
cies have nothing to do with desktop management. Answer C is incorrect because
VPN remote access will not improve enterprise desktop management. Answer D is
incorrect because roaming profiles do not add a layer of security.  
27. Answer: B. Mobile voice encryption can allow executives and employees alike to dis-
cuss sensitive information without having to travel to secure company locations.
Answer A is incorrect because in the event a mobile device is lost, GPS tracking can
be used to find the location.  Answer C is incorrect because a remote wipe allows the
handheld’s data to be remotely deleted in the event the device is lost or stolen.
Answer D is incorrect because a screen lock or passcode is used to prevent access to
the phone.
28. Answers: B, C. To establish effective security baselines, enterprise network security
management requires a measure of commonality between the systems. Mandatory
settings, standard application suites, and initial setup configuration details all factor
into the security stance of an enterprise network. Answer A is incorrect because cable
locks have nothing to do with effective security baselines. Answer D is incorrect
because decentralized management does not have anything to do with security base-
lines.
29. Answers: A, B.  All host devices must have some type of malware protection. A nec-
essary software program for protecting the user environment is antivirus software.
Antivirus software is used to scan for malicious code in email and downloaded files.
Antispam, antispyware software can add another layer of defense to the infrastructure.
Pop-up blocking software programs are available through browsers. Answer C is
incorrect because content filtering is done at the server level to keep host machines
from accessing certain content. Answer D is incorrect because web tracking software
merely tracks the sites a person visited.
30. Answer: C. Host software baselining can be done for a variety of reasons, including
malware monitoring and creating system images. Generally, the environment needs of
an organization will fall into a legacy, enterprise, or high-security client. Answer A is
incorrect because virtualization adds a layer of security as well as improves enterprise
desktop management and control with faster deployment of desktops and fewer sup-
port calls due to application conflicts. Answer B is incorrect because network storage
policies have nothing to do with desktop management. Answer D is incorrect because
roaming profiles do not add a layer of security.
31. Answer: D. A screen lock or passcode is used to prevent access to the phone. Answer
A is incorrect because in the event a mobile device is lost, GPS tracking can be used
to find the location. Answer B is incorrect because mobile voice encryption can allow
executives and employees alike to discuss sensitive information without having to
travel to secure company locations. Answer C is incorrect because a remote wipe
allows the handheld’s data to be remotely deleted in the event the device is lost or
stolen.

to prevent access to the phone.
33. Answer: B. Just like the data on hard drives, the data on mobiles can be encrypted.
Answer A is incorrect because in the event a mobile device is lost, GPS tracking can
be used to find the location. Answer C is incorrect. A remote wipe allows the hand-
held’s data to be remotely deleted in the event the device is lost or stolen. Answer D is
incorrect because a screen lock or passcode is used to prevent access to the phone.  
34. Answer: A. A virtualized “sandboxed” guest system can help in computer-security
research, which enables the study of the effects of some viruses or worms without the
possibility of compromising the host system.  Answer B is incorrect because network
storage has nothing to do with desktop management. Answer C is incorrect because
host software baselining can be done for a variety of reasons, including malware mon-
itoring and creating system images. Answer D is incorrect because application baselin-
ing is used to monitor changes in application behavior.
35. Answers: A, B.  All host devices must have some type of malware protection. A nec-
essary software program for protecting the user environment is antivirus software.
Antivirus software is used to scan for malicious code in email and downloaded files.
Antispam, antispyware software can add another layer of defense to the infrastructure.

Objective 4.3: Explain the importance of
data security.
1. Answer: B. A vulnerability in the BIOS can allow local users to cause a denial of serv-
ice and the system to not boot. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because they are all
types of storage devices.
2. Answer: C. Organizations fail to protect data when it reaches its final resting on these
storage subsystems. Although many organizations protect data in motion using
encryption, they fail to protect that same data when it reaches its final resting on stor-
age subsystems. Answer A is incorrect. Network attached storage is a large-capacity
device, and it not easy to lose. Answer B is incorrect because it describes virtualiza-
tion. Answer D is incorrect because antivirus software can be installed on large stor-
age systems.
3. Answer: A. Just about everyone carries a cell phone, and most corporate workers
have PDAs. These devices have associated risks. The first is theft or loss. It is estimat-
ed that eight million cell phones are lost or stolen every year. For many organizations,

Domain 4.0: Application, Data, and Host Security
263
losing a cell phone or a PDA loaded with contacts, emails, and client data can be a
severe detriment to business. Handheld devices are rarely password protected, even
though they contain a remarkable amount of data. Answer B is incorrect; antivirus
software can be installed on mobile systems. Answer C is incorrect because encryp-
tion can be used with handheld devices. Answer D is incorrect because cracking the
password on handheld devices is no easier than regular password cracking.
4. Answer: B, D. A vulnerability in the BIOS can allow local users to cause a denial of
service and the system to not boot. Answer A is incorrect because a hard drive failure
has to do with the hard disk itself and nothing to do with the BIOS. Answer C is incor-
rect because system lockup implies that the machine was already booted and is asso-
ciated more with attacks that happen after the machine is up and running.
5. Answer: A. Small, high-capacity, removable storage devices present a concern when it
comes to corporate security and protecting proprietary information. It is quite simple
for a disgruntled employee to take data and sell it. Answers B and C are incorrect
because the devices can be scanned for malware and can also be encrypted. Answer D
is incorrect because having the device break off in the computer is not a security risk.
6. Answer: D. Group Policy can be used to disable the capacity for unauthorized users to
use any USB storage devices. Another layer of protection can be applied by encrypting
and properly securing sensitive corporate information. Answer A is incorrect because
editing the Registry can cause harm. Answer B is incorrect because filling the USB
slots with glue can cause harm to the computer. Answer C is incorrect because the
Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores password information.
7. Answer: B, C, D. The BIOS can be compromised in several ways: the BIOS password,
known vulnerabilities, and bypassing access control. Answer A is incorrect because
editing the Registry is done after the system had already booted.
8. Answer: B. To provide convenience and redundancy, technology such as WLAN, USB,
and Bluetooth connections are used with client software to sync PDAs and cell phones
to a user’s desktop computer. There are also enterprise-level product suites. Although
this might prevent lost data, it also presents other risks. New security threats targeting
cell phones and other mobile devices could quickly become bigger than anything the
industry has seen so far. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
9. Answer: B. Security policy should dictate that sensitive data be encrypted. Answer A is
incorrect because limiting email address access would cause excessive overhead.
Answer C is incorrect because eliminating attachments would not secure the commu-
nication. Answer D is incorrect because the use of passwords would not secure the
communication.
10. Answer: A, C, D. BIOS access control can be bypassed by cracking the BIOS pass-
word, overloading the keyboard buffer, and deleting the contents of the CMOS RAM.
Answer B is incorrect because the MBR is part of the hard disk configuration and has
nothing to do with the BIOS.
11. Answer: C. System access to the BIOS configuration utility is controlled by a pass-
word. After the password is set, the configuration of the computer cannot be changed
without inputting the password. Answers A and B are incorrect because they are hard-
ware devices. Answer D is incorrect because Access Control Lists are used on routers
and operating systems but not on the BIOS.

264
Chapter 4
12. Answer: D. The BIOS passwords of laptops are a bit different in that the passwords
are usually flashed into firmware. Answers A and B are incorrect because encryption is
not automatic for all BIOS versions. Answer C is incorrect because desktop BIOS
passwords are stored in the CMOS and are not flashed into the firmware.
13. Answer: A, C. Depending on the manufacturer, the laptop may have a hardware don-
gle or special loopback device to bypass the password. Answer B is incorrect because
a lock pick is used for breaking standard locking mechanisms such as a door lock.
Answer D is incorrect because reseating the memory will not reset or bypass the
password.
14. Answer: B, C. Many organizations do not have a policy for BIOS passwords. In many
organizations, most computers share the same BIOS password, and that password is
seldom changed. If an attacker manages to gain physical access, a large portion of the
network could be compromised. Answer A is incorrect because sharing the same BIOS
password is not good practice and leaves the machine vulnerable. Answer D is incor-
rect because a hard disk drive password is used after the system boots.
15. Answer: D. It is quite simple for a disgruntled employee to misuse data (take the data
and sell it, for instance). Of course, the real issue is access to the information.
However, if the information is readily available, even employees with good intentions
might misplace or have a removable storage device stolen. Answers A, B, and C are
incorrect; the main underlying concern is the amount of data that is available to
employees, not unencrypted data, the ability to access multiple machines, or malware
infection.
16. Answer: A. The more capabilities a device has, the more vulnerable the device. The
Cabir virus has been found in about 15 different variations. According to a report from
an Ireland-based cell phone security company, in mid-2008 the security company
tracked 100,000 virus incidents per day. Answer B is incorrect because rootkits are
normally not found on handheld devices. Answers C and D are incorrect because they
both imply that the users are the ones sending the text messages.
17. Answer: C. The more capabilities a device has, the more vulnerable the device. The
Cabir virus has been found in about 15 different variations. According to a report from
an Ireland-based cell phone security company, in mid-2008 the security company
tracked 100,000 virus incidents per day. Answer A is incorrect because it implies that
the users are the ones sending the text messages. Answer B is incorrect because not
all devices currently have intrusion detection software available. Answer D is incorrect
because encryption will not eliminate virus threats.
18. Answer: A, B, D. Removable hard drives, especially the small passport types, afford
users the convenience to carry files for both their work environment and their home
environment in one device. This convenience provides an opportunity for viruses and
other malware to spread between networks and physical locations as they share files
in both environments and with other users. In addition to malware infections, these
devices have a large amount of storage space, so they lend themselves to data theft
and information leakage. Answer C is incorrect. Reduced productivity should not be a
byproduct of allowing removable hard drives.

Domain 4.0: Application, Data, and Host Security
265
19. Answer: B. A better approach is to combine security policies with purchasing and
issuing removable storage devices and encrypting them as necessary. Then allow only
the approved devices and block all unauthorized devices. Although answers A and C
are viable solutions, they are not the best approach. Answer D is incorrect because it
causes undue administrative overhead.
20. Answer: A. An organization should consider implementing controls that ensure all
portable devices and removable media are encrypted and accounted for. The security
policy should require encryption of all data on portable computers and removable
storage. Answer B is incorrect because passwords can easily be cracked, especially if
there are not proper password policies in place. Answers C and D are incorrect
because employee dismissal and employee remediation will do nothing to protect the
data if the device is lost. 
21. Answer: C, D. A good antivirus solution is essential to protect the integrity of stored
data and to prevent malware from spreading to other parts of the network through the
storage system. Additional considerations when dealing with large data repositories
should include encryption, authentication devices, secure logging, and key manage-
ment. Answer A is incorrect because it describes a solution for small storage devices.
Answer B is incorrect because passwords can easily be cracked, especially if there are
not proper password policies in place.
22. Answer: A, B, C, D. A good antivirus solution is essential to protect the integrity of
stored data and to prevent malware from spreading to other parts of the network
through the storage system. Additional considerations when dealing with large data
repositories should include encryption, authentication devices, secure logging, and key
management.
23. Answer: C. Some security appliances sit on a SAN or are connected to NAS to protect
data considered “at rest.” Answers A and B are incorrect because they are handheld
devices and the data changes. Answer D is incorrect. The BIOS is not considered data
at rest.
24. Answer: B. Many BIOS manufacturers build in backdoor passwords. Often, they are
simple, such as the name of the BIOS manufacturer. In addition, lists of known back-
door passwords are available on the Internet. Because this method of access has
become so public, BIOS manufacturers have become more secretive about any back-
doors they may now use. Answer A is incorrect because secure BIOS passwords can
be made. Answer C is incorrect because the BIOS does not lock the user out after too
many bad passwords. This is a condition set with Group Policy. Answer D is incorrect
because too many incorrect BIOS password guesses will not destroy it, but improperly
flashing it will.
25. Answer: D. If an attacker gains physical access to the machine and changes the boot
order, there is no way to protect the system from compromise. An attacker could boot
the system from a device that contains software to change the administrative pass-
word, extract password information for a later attack, directly access data on the hard
disk, or install a backdoor or Trojan. Answers A and B are incorrect; a DoS attack and
virus do not require physical access to the machine. Answer C is incorrect because the
MBR is concerned with operating system boot order, not BIOS boot order.

266
Chapter 4
26. Answer: C. The internal user has the greatest access to data and the opportunity to
either deliberately sabotage it or accidentally delete it. Although partnering vendors,
contract workers, and external users have the opportunity to damage data, they do not
have enough permission to accidentally delete data, nor do they have access to data
as readily as internal users. Based on this information, answers A, B, and D are incor-
rect.
27. Answer: C. Protection of data in use is considered to be an endpoint solution and the
application is run on end-user workstations or servers in the organization. Answer A is
incorrect because protection of data in motion is considered to be a network solution,
and either a hardware or software solution is installed near the network perimeter to
monitor for and flag policy violations. Answer B is incorrect because protection of data
at rest is considered to be a storage solution and is generally a software solution that
monitors how confidential data is stored. Answer D is incorrect because there is no
such data state.
28. Answer: D. TPM refers to a secure crypto-processor used to authenticate hardware
devices such as PC or laptop. The idea behind TPM is to allow any encryption-enabled
application to take advantage of the chip.  Answer A is incorrect because Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures
needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates. Answer
B is incorrect because  full-disk encryption involves encrypting the operating system
partition on a computer and then booting and running with the system drive encrypted
at all times. Answer C is incorrect because in file or folder level encryption, individual
files or directories are encrypted by the file system itself.
29. Answer: B. One of the biggest challenges associated with database encryption is key
management. Answer A is incorrect because multi-tenancy is a security issue related
to cloud-computing implementations. Answer C is incorrect because lack of manage-
ment software and weak authentication components are associated with hardware
hard drive encryption. Answer D is incorrect because cost and platform support are
concerns with smart phone encryption products. 
30. Answer: A. The PKCS#11 standard provides for access to public and private asymmet-
ric keys, symmetric keys, X.509 certificates and application data.  PKCS#11 is the de
facto standard for platform applications, although some newer HSMs include more
advanced authentication and authorization models. Answer B is incorrect because
PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard describes the syntax for data
streams, such as digital signatures that may have cryptography applied to them.
Answer C is incorrect because AES is most commonly found on USB drive encryption.
Answer D is incorrect because EFS is the encrypting file system available in newer
Microsoft operating systems.
31. Answer: A. In a SaaS environment, application level encryption is preferred because
the data is encrypted by the application before being stored in the database or file sys-
tem. The advantage is that it protects the data from the user all the way to storage.
Answer B is incorrect because in cloud implementations, data should be encrypted at
the application layer, rather than within a database, due to the complexity involved,
and media encryption is managed at the storage layer. Answer C is incorrect because

Domain 4.0: Application, Data, and Host Security
267
encryption of a complete virtual machine on IaaS could be considered media encryp-
tion.  Answer D is incorrect because a HSM solution is mainly found in private data-
centers that manage and offload cryptography with dedicated hardware appliances.
32. Answer: A. Protection of data in motion is considered to be a network solution, and
either a hardware or software solution is installed near the network perimeter to moni-
tor for and flag policy violations. Answer B is incorrect because protection of data at
rest is considered to be a storage solution and is generally a software solution that
monitors how confidential data is stored. Answer C is incorrect because protection of
data in use is considered to be an endpoint solution, and the application is run on end-
user workstations or servers in the organization. Answer D is incorrect because there
is no such data state.
33. Answer: B. Protection of data at rest is considered to be a storage solution and is gen-
erally a software solution that monitors how confidential data is stored. Answer A is
incorrect because protection of data in motion is considered to be a network solution,
and either a hardware or software solution is installed near the network perimeter to
monitor for and flag policy violations. Answer C is incorrect because protection of data
in use is considered to be an endpoint solution, and the application is run on end-user
workstations or servers in the organization. Answer D is incorrect because there is no
such data state.
34. Answer: A. Full disk encryption is most useful when you’re dealing with a machine that
is being taken on the road, such as those used by traveling executives, sales man-
agers, or insurance agents. Answer B is incorrect because in file or folder level
encryption, individual files or directories are encrypted by the file system itself.
Answer C is incorrect because media encryption is used for USB flash drives, iPods,
and other portable storage devices. Answer D is incorrect because application level
encryption will not protect the data stored on the machine.
35. Answer: B. In file or folder level encryption, individual files or directories are encrypted
by the file system itself. Perhaps one of the most common examples of this type of
encryption is the encrypting file system (EFS) available in newer Microsoft operating
systems. Answer A is incorrect because full disk encryption is most useful when
you’re dealing with a machine that is being taken on the road, such as those used by
traveling executives, sales managers, or insurance agents. Answer C is incorrect
because media encryption is used for USB flash drives, iPods, and other portable stor-
age devices. Answer D is incorrect because application level encryption is used in
cloud implementations.
36. Answer: D. In a cloud environment, application level encryption is preferred because
the data is encrypted by the application before being stored in the database or file sys-
tem. The advantage is that it protects the data from the user all the way to storage.
Answer A is incorrect because full disk encryption is most useful when you’re dealing
with a machine that is being taken on the road, such as those used by traveling execu-
tives, sales managers, or insurance agents. Answer B is incorrect because in file or
folder level encryption, individual files or directories are encrypted by the file system
itself. Answer C is incorrect because media encryption is used for USB flash drives,
iPods, and other portable storage devices.

37. Answer: B. Traditionally, HSMs have been used in the banking sector to secure numer-
ous large, bulk transactions.  Answer A is incorrect because full disk encryption is
most useful when you’re dealing with a machine that is being taken on the road, such
as those used by traveling executives, sales managers, or insurance agents. Answer C
is incorrect because TPM refers to a secure crypto processor used to authenticate
hardware devices, such as PCs or laptops. Answer D is incorrect because in file or
folder level encryption, individual files or directories are encrypted by the file system
itself. 
38. Answer: C. At the most basic level, TPM provides for the secure storage of keys,
passwords, and digital certificates, and is hardware-based, typically attached to the
circuit board of the system.  Answer A is incorrect because full disk encryption is
meant to encrypt the entire contents of the drive, including temporary files and memo-
ry. Answer B is incorrect because a hardware security module (HSM) can be described
as black box combination hardware and software/firmware that is attached or con-
tained inside a computer used to provide cryptographic functions for tamper protec-
tion and increased performance. Answer D is incorrect because in file or folder level
encryption, individual files or directories are encrypted by the file system itself.
39. Answer: A. The HSM and cloud machines can both live on the same virtual private net-
work, through the use of a virtual private cloud (VPC) environment. This type of solu-
tion is mainly found in private datacenters that manage and offload cryptography with
dedicated hardware appliances.  Answer B is incorrect because traditionally HSMs
have been used in the banking sector to secure numerous large, bulk transactions.
Answer C is incorrect because TPM refers to a secure crypto processor used to
authenticate hardware devices, such as PCs or laptops. Answer D is incorrect because
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of hardware, software, people, policies, and
procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certifi-
cates.
40. Answer: C. With hardware disk encryption, authentication happens on power up of the
drive through either a software pre-boot authentication environment or with a BIOS
password. Enhanced firmware and special purpose cryptographic hardware are built in
to the hard disks. Answer A is incorrect because TPM refers to a secure crypto
processor used to authenticate hardware devices, such as PCs or laptops. Answer B is
incorrect because a hardware security module (HSM) can be described as black box
combination hardware and software/firmware that is attached or contained inside a
computer used to provide cryptographic functions for tamper protection and increased
performance. Answer D is incorrect because in file or folder level encryption, individ-
ual files or directories are encrypted by the file system itself.

Management
The concept of security within the network environment
includes aspects drawn from all operating systems, application
software packages, hardware solutions, and networking con-
figurations present within the network to be secured, and from
within any network-sharing connectivity directly or indirectly
with the network to be secured. For the Security+ exam, you
need to develop the broadest set of skills possible, gaining
experience from the most specific to the most general of secu-
rity concepts. This chapter focuses on access control mecha-
nisms and methods for secure network authentication and
physical access. A general knowledge of network terminology
will aid in understanding these concepts. As a prospective
security professional, you should also take every opportunity
you may find to expand your skill base beyond these. The fol-
lowing list identifies the key areas from Domain 5.0 (which
counts as 13% of the exam) that you need to master:
. Explain the function and purpose of authentication
services
. Explain the fundamental concepts and best practices
related to authorization and access control
. Implement appropriate security controls when per-
forming account management

Answers and Explanations
Objective 5.1: Explain the function and 
purpose of authentication services.
1. Answer: B, C, D. The strengths of Kerberos authentication come from its time-
synchronized connections and the use of registered client and service keys within the
Key Distribution Center (KDC). The Key Distribution Center (KDC) is a trusted third
party that consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and 
a Ticket-Granting Server (TGS). Answer A is incorrect because Kerberos is not used
with remote-access connections.
2. Answer: D. Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) functions over
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections. CHAP can be used to provide on-demand
authentication within an ongoing data transmission. Based on the previous informa-
tion, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
3. Answer: B. TACACS+ is a remote-access control system providing authentication,
authorization, and accounting (AAA). Answer A is incorrect; it describes Kerberos.
Kerberos is a symmetric-key authentication protocol used to protect sending actual
logon information across an unsecured network. Answer C is incorrect; it describes
RADIUS. RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for creden-
tials to resources within an extended enterprise. Answer D is incorrect; it describes
CHAP. The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can be used to 
provide on-demand authentication within an ongoing data transmission.
4. Answer: C. RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for creden-
tials to resources within an extended enterprise Answer A is incorrect; it describes
Kerberos. Kerberos is a symmetric-key authentication protocol used to protect sending
actual logon information across an unsecured network. Answer B is incorrect; it
describes TACACS+. TACACS+ is a remote-access control system providing authenti-
cation, authorization, and accounting (AAA). Answer D is incorrect; it describes CHAP.
The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can be used to provide 
on-demand authentication within an ongoing data transmission.
5. Answer: D. The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can be used to
provide on-demand authentication within an ongoing data transmission. Answer A is

RADIUS. RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for creden-
tials to resources within an extended enterprise. Answer D is incorrect; it describes
CHAP. The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can be used to pro-
vide on-demand authentication within an ongoing data transmission.
7. Answer: B. The IEEE 802.1x standard for wireless port-based access control can be
used to provide authentication as well as access control, but is often paired with a
RADIUS server to facilitate enterprisewide access management. Answer A is incorrect;
Kerberos is a symmetric-key authentication protocol used to protect sending actual
logon information across an unsecured network. Answer C is incorrect; TACACS+ is a
remote-access control system providing authentication, authorization, and accounting
(AAA). Answer D is incorrect; it describes CHAP. The Challenge-Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can be used to provide on-demand authentication
within an ongoing data transmission.
8. Answer: D. The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol uses two compared val-
ues created using the MD5 hashing algorithm. Answer A is incorrect; Kerberos is a
symmetric-key authentication protocol used to protect sending actual logon informa-
tion across an unsecured network. Answer B is incorrect; TACACS+ is a remote-access
control system providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). Answer
C is incorrect; RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for cre-
dentials to resources within an extended enterprise.
9. Answer: C. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solution involves an asymmetric encryp-
tion scheme in which a public key is used to encrypt data and a separate private key is
used to decrypt the data. Answer A is incorrect; Kerberos is a symmetric-key authenti-
cation protocol used to protect sending actual logon information across an unsecured
network. Answer B is incorrect; TACACS is a remote-access control system providing
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). Answer D is incorrect; the
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol uses two compared values created
using the MD5 hashing algorithm.
10. Answer: A, B, D. Any combination of authentication methods may be used in a multi-
factor solution. Multifactor authentication just refers to solutions including more than
a single type of authentication. Answer C is incorrect. Anonymous access is the weak-
est form of authentication and is not combined with other authentication methods.
11. Answer: B. Iris profile biometric devices identify an individual by using the colored
part of the eye that surrounds the pupil. Answer A is incorrect because signature
matches an individual’s electronic signature to a database by comparing electronic sig-
nals created by the speed and manner in which a document is signed. Answer C is
incorrect because facial geometry identifies a user based on the profile and character-
istics of the user’s face. Answer D is incorrect because a retina scan identifies an indi-
vidual by using the blood-vessel pattern at the back of the eyeball.
12. Answer: A, B. When using biometrics, remember that each method has its own
degree of error ratios, and some methods may seem invasive to the users and may
not be accepted gracefully. Answer C is incorrect because account lockouts have to do
with passwords. Answer D is incorrect because cross-contamination is a physical con-
cern not associated with biometric solutions.

13. Answer: A. Virtual private network (VPN) connections provide a mechanism for the
creation of a secured “tunnel” through a public network such as the Internet, which
then encapsulates data packets to prevent sniffing over the public network. Answer B
is incorrect because a remote-access service (RAS) server functions as a gateway
through which the remote user may access local resources or gain connectivity to the
Internet. Answer C is incorrect because the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) allows authentication of logon identities over TCP/IP connectivity against a
hierarchical directory. Answer D is incorrect; RADIUS provides centralized authentica-
tion and access control for credentials to resources within an extended enterprise.
14. Answer: B. Client systems equipped with a modem can connect using normal dial-up
acoustic connections to a properly equipped remote-access service (RAS) server,
which functions as a gateway through which the remote user may access local
resources or gain connectivity to the Internet. Answer A is incorrect; virtual private
network (VPN) connections provide a mechanism for the creation of a secured “tun-
nel” through a public network such as the Internet, which then encapsulates data
packets to prevent sniffing over the public network. Answer C is incorrect because the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows authentication of logon identities
over TCP/IP connectivity against a hierarchical directory. Answer D is incorrect;
RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for credentials to
resources within an extended enterprise.
15. Answer: C. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows authentication of
logon identities over TCP/IP connectivity against a hierarchical directory. Answer A is
incorrect; virtual private network (VPN) connections provide a mechanism for the cre-
ation of a secured “tunnel” through a public network such as the Internet, which then
encapsulates data packets to prevent sniffing over the public network. Answer B is
incorrect because a remote-access service (RAS) server functions as a gateway
through which the remote user may access local resources or gain connectivity to the
Internet. Answer D is incorrect; RADIUS provides centralized authentication and
access control for credentials to resources within an extended enterprise.
16. Answer: D. RADIUS provides centralized authentication and access control for creden-
tials to resources within an extended enterprise. Answer A is incorrect; virtual private
network (VPN) connections provide a mechanism for the creation of a secured “tun-
nel” through a public network such as the Internet, which then encapsulates data
packets to prevent sniffing over the public network. Answer B is incorrect because a
remote-access service (RAS) server functions as a gateway through which the remote
user may access local resources or gain connectivity to the Internet. Answer C is
incorrect because the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows authenti-
cation of logon identities over TCP/IP connectivity against a hierarchical directory.
17. Answer: A, B. Modern solutions provide for both user authentication and authoriza-
tion, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or Terminal
Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) protocols. Answer C is
incorrect because the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows authenti-
cation of logon identities over TCP/IP connectivity against a hierarchical directory.
Answer D is incorrect because remote-access service (RAS) functions as a gateway
through which the remote user may access local resources or gain connectivity to the
Internet.

Chapter 5
18. Answer: C. Remember that LDAP is a TCP/IP-based protocol connecting by default to
TCP port 389. Answers A and D are incorrect; ports 161 and 162 are used by SNMP.
Answer B is incorrect because port 110 is used by POP3 for email.
19. Answer: C. RADIUS encrypts only the password in the access-request packet, from
the client to the server. The remainder of the packet is unencrypted. Based on this
information, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
20. Answer: B. RADIUS, which was developed originally for modem-based connectivity
access control uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport. Answer A is incorrect;
RADIUS uses UDP, which is connectionless oriented, whereas TCP is a connection-
oriented protocol. Answer C is incorrect. File Transfer Protocol is not connected with
the use of RADIUS. Answer D is incorrect. SMTP is used for email communication.
21. Answer: A. TACACS+ is similar to Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS), but relies on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) rather than RADIUS’s
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport developed originally for modem-based con-
nectivity access control. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect. File
Transfer Protocol is not connected with the use of TACACS+. Answer D is incorrect.
SMTP is used for email communication. 
22. Answer: D. CHAP functions over Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections. PPP is a
protocol for communicating between two points using a serial interface and provides
service at the second layer of the OSI model: the data link layer. PPP can handle both
synchronous and asynchronous connections. Answer A is incorrect. File Transfer
Protocol is not connected with the use of CHAP. Answer B is incorrect; PPTP is not
used as a connection protocol for CHAP. Answer C is incorrect; Shiva Password
Authentication Protocol (SPAP) was designed by Shiva and is an older, two-way
reversible encryption protocol that encrypts the password data sent between client 
and server.
23. Answer: C. TACACS is a client/server protocol that provides the same functionality as
RADIUS, except that RADIUS is an actual Internet standard; therefore, answer A is
incorrect. Answers B and D are incorrect because both RADIUS and TACACS are
authentication protocols.
24. Answer: A, D. Biometric devices are susceptible to false acceptance and false rejection
rates. The false acceptance rate (FAR) is a measure of the likelihood that the access
system will wrongly accept an access attempt. In other words, it will allow access to
an unauthorized user. The false rejection rate (FRR) is the percentage of identification
instances in which false rejection occurs. In false rejection, the system fails to recog-
nize an authorized person and rejects that person as unauthorized. Answers B and 
C are incorrect because false positives and negatives are associated with intrusion
detection systems.
25. Answer: C. Biometric devices are susceptible to false acceptance and false rejection
rates. The false rejection rate (FRR) is the percentage of identification instances in
which false rejection occurs. In false rejection, the system fails to recognize an author-
ized person and rejects that person as unauthorized. Answer A is incorrect because it
describes false negative. The false acceptance rate (FAR) is a measure of the likelihood
that the access system will wrongly accept an access attempt. In other words, it will
allow access to an unauthorized user. Therefore, answer B is incorrect. Answer D is
incorrect because it describes a false positive.

Objective 5.2: Explain the fundamental 
concepts and best practices related to
authorization and access control.
1. Answer: B. The phrase “less is more” is a convenient reminder of the security practice
known as the principle of least privilege, where an account is granted no more access
rights than the bare minimum needed to perform assigned tasks. Answer A is incor-
rect because implicit deny is an access control practice wherein resource availability is
restricted to only those logons explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even
when not explicitly denied access. Answer C is incorrect because job rotation is an
extension of the separation of duties. Rotating administrative users between roles
improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while also ensuring that fraudulent
activity cannot be sustained. Answer D is incorrect; expiration is an access control
practice to expire passwords on a regular basis, protecting against brute-force pass-
word-guessing attacks, and to expire accounts not used after a certain period of time.
2. Answer: B. The User Account Control (UAC) technology used by the Microsoft operat-
ing system ensures that software applications cannot perform privileged access with-
out additional authorization from the user. Within the Microsoft environment, lesser
accounts may perform privileged processes using the “run as” option to specify the
explicit use of a privileged account. Answer A is incorrect because implicit deny is an
access control practice wherein resource availability is restricted to only those logons
explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even when not explicitly denied
access. Answer C is incorrect because job rotation is an extension of the separation of
duties. Rotating administrative users between roles improves awareness of the man-
dates of each role, while also ensuring that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained.
Answer D is incorrect; expiration is an access control practice to expire passwords on
a regular basis, protecting against brute-force password-guessing attacks, and to
expire accounts not used after a certain period of time.
3. Answer: A. Implicit deny is an access control practice wherein resource availability is
restricted to only those logons explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even
when not explicitly denied access. Answer B is incorrect; the phrase “less is more” is a
convenient reminder of the security practice known as the principle of least privilege,
where an account is granted no more access rights than the bare minimum needed to
perform assigned tasks. Answer C is incorrect because job rotation is an extension of
the separation of duties. Rotating administrative users between roles both improves
awareness of the mandates of each role and also ensures that fraudulent activity 
cannot be sustained. Answer D is incorrect; expiration is an access control practice 
to expire passwords on a regular basis, protecting against brute-force password-
guessing attacks, and to expire accounts not used after a certain period of time.
4. Answer: C. Separation of duties is an access control practice involving both the sepa-
ration of logons, such as day-to-day and admin accounts assigned to the same net-
work admin, as well as the separation of roles, such as security assignment and com-
pliance audit procedures. Answer A is incorrect. Rotating administrative users between
roles improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while also ensuring that
fraudulent activity cannot be sustained. This is also the reason that users with admin-
istrative access may be required to take vacations, allowing other administrators to

review standard operating practices in place. Answer B is incorrect; the phrase “less is
more” is a convenient reminder of the security practice known as the principle of least
privilege, where an account is granted no more access rights than the bare minimum
needed to perform assigned tasks. Answer D is incorrect. Rotating administrative
users between roles improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while also
ensuring that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained.
5. Answer: D. Expiration is an access control practice to expire passwords on a regular
basis, protecting against brute-force password-guessing attacks, and to expire
accounts not used after a certain period of time. Answer A is incorrect because rota-
tion refers to alternating administrative users between roles to improve awareness of
the mandates of each role and ensure that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained.
Answer B is incorrect because purging is an action used to get rid of records. Answer
C is incorrect because aging is associated with the length of time a password can be
used.
6. Answer: C. Job rotation is an extension of the separation of duties. Rotating adminis-
trative users between roles improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while
also ensuring that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained. Answer A is incorrect.
Implicit deny is an access control practice wherein resource availability is restricted to
only those logons explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even when not
explicitly denied access. Answer B is incorrect; the phrase “less is more” is a conven-
ient reminder of the security practice known as the principle of least privilege, where
an account is granted no more access rights than the bare minimum needed to per-
form assigned tasks. Answer D is incorrect; expiration is an access control practice

explicitly denied access. Answer B is incorrect; the phrase “less is more” is a conven-
ient reminder of the security practice known as the principle of least privilege, where
an account is granted no more access rights than the bare minimum needed to per-
form assigned tasks. Answer D is incorrect; expiration is an access control practice 
to expire passwords on a regular basis, protecting against brute-force password-
guessing attacks, and to expire accounts not used after a certain period of time.
11. Answer: D. Expiration is an access control practice to expire passwords on a regular
basis, protecting against brute-force password-guessing attacks, and to expire
accounts not used after a certain period of time. Unused accounts often retain weak
passwords used in initial assignment and may be more susceptible to password-
guessing routines. Answer A is incorrect. Implicit deny is an access control practice
wherein resource availability is restricted to only those logons explicitly granted
access, remaining unavailable even when not explicitly denied access. Answer B is
incorrect; the phrase “less is more” is a convenient reminder of the security practice
known as the principle of least privilege, where an account is granted no more access
rights than the bare minimum needed to perform assigned tasks. Answer C is incor-
rect because job rotation is an extension of the separation of duties. Rotating adminis-
trative users between roles improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while
also ensuring that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained.
12. Answer: B. Separation of account functionality protects the network by ensuring that
an inadvertent malware execution during normal daily operations cannot then attack
the network with full administrative privileges. Answer A is incorrect because segrega-
tion of duties is an access control practice involving both the separation of logons,
such as day-to-day and admin accounts assigned to the same network admin, and the
separation of roles. Answer C is incorrect. Separation of role duties ensures that vali-
dation is maintained apart from execution, protecting the network against fraudulent

actions or incomplete execution of security mandates. Answer D is incorrect.
Segregation of resources would be a separate subnet or a segment separated by 
a firewall.
13. Answer: A. The User Account Control (UAC) technology used by the Microsoft operat-
ing systems ensures that software applications cannot perform privileged access with-
out additional authorization from the user. Within the Microsoft environment, lesser
accounts may perform privileged processes using the “run as” option to specify the
explicit use of a privileged account. Answer B is incorrect because the “send to”
option is a right-click function used to export files. Answer C is incorrect. Gpresult is
used to the see the resultant set of group policies. Answer D is incorrect. The run
command is a start menu item option used to run programs.
14. Answer: D. Unused accounts often retain weak passwords used in initial assignment
and may be more susceptible to password-guessing routines. Answer A is incorrect
because spoofing involves modifying the source address of traffic or source of infor-
mation. Answer B is incorrect. A null session is a connection without specifying a
username or password. Null sessions are a possible security risk because the connec-
tion is not really authenticated. Answer C is incorrect because ARP poisoning allows a
perpetrator to trick a device into thinking any IP is related to any MAC address.
15. Answer: C. Job rotation is an extension of the separation of duties. Rotating adminis-
trative users between roles improves awareness of the mandates of each role, while
also ensuring that fraudulent activity cannot be sustained. Answer A is incorrect.

16. Answer: B, C, D. Authentication can be generally broken into three basic forms,
depending on what is required to authorize access: something you know, something
you have, or something you are. Answer A is incorrect because something you touch
may be a method used for validation, not a basic form.
17. Answer: B. Using a login and password is single-factor because it consists of only
what you know. Therefore, it is not considered multifactor authentication. Multifactor
authentication involves the use of two or more different forms of authentication.
Different forms include what you know (logon, password, PIN), what you have (key-
card, SecureID number generator), or what you are (biometrics). Therefore, answer A
is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect; Kerberos v5 includes support for a process known
as mutual authentication, where both the identity of the client that is requesting
authentication and the server that is providing authentication are verified. Answer D is
incorrect; Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) provides on-demand
authentication.
18. Answer: C. Kerberos v5 includes support for a process known as mutual authentica-
tion, where both the identity of the client that is requesting authentication and the

server that is providing authentication are verified. Multifactor authentication involves
the use of two or more different forms of authentication. Different forms include 
what you know (logon, password, PIN), what you have (keycard, SecureID number
generator), or what you are (biometrics). Therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answer 
B is incorrect. Using a login and password is not considered multifactor authentica-
tion. It is single-factor because it consists of only what you know. Answer D is 
incorrect; Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) provides on-demand

19. Answer: D. Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) provides on-
demand authentication. Multifactor authentication involves the use of two or more 
different forms of authentication. Different forms include what you know (logon, 
password, PIN), what you have (keycard, SecureID number generator), or what you
are (biometrics). Therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect. Using a login
and password is not considered multifactor authentication. It is single-factor because
it consists of only what you know. Answer C is incorrect; Kerberos v5 includes sup-
port for a process known as mutual authentication, where both the identity of the
client that is requesting authentication and the server that is providing authentication
are verified.
20. Answer: A. Multifactor authentication involves the use of two or more different forms
of authentication. Different forms include what you know (logon, password, PIN), what
you have (keycard, SecureID number generator), or what you are (biometrics). Answer
B is incorrect. Using a login and password is not considered multifactor authentica-
tion. It is single-factor because it consists of only what you know. Answer C is incor-
rect; Kerberos v5 includes support for a process known as mutual authentication,
where both the identity of the client that is requesting authentication and the server
that is providing authentication are verified. Answer D is incorrect; Challenge-
Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) provides on-demand authentication.
21. Answer: B. Before authorization can occur for anything other than anonymous access
to wholly public resources, the identity of the account attempting to access a resource
must first be determined. This process is known as authentication. The most well-
known form of authentication is the use of a logon account identifier and password
combination to access controlled resources. Access is not possible without both parts
required for account authentication, so a level of protection is provided. Therefore,
answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
22. Answer: D. The shortcoming of any authentication system is that the keys used may
be easily falsified and access rights may be granted to an unauthorized access
attempt. Null or easily guessed passwords are one of the most widespread examples
of the potential for this weakness. Answer A is incorrect because lost tokens are asso-
ciated with biometric methods or multifactor authentication. Answer B is incorrect;
false positives are associated with intrusion detection systems. Answer C is incorrect
because weak encryption is most closely associated with wireless networks.
23. Answer: A. Most libraries require the creation of an account or a library card to use
the computers and kiosks. Anonymous or open access represents the weakest possi-
ble form of authentication, whereas the requirement for both a logon identifier and
password combination may be considered the most basic of actual account verifica-
tion. The highest levels of authentication may involve not only account logon, but also

304
Chapter 5
when the logon is occurring from specific network addresses or whether a security
token such as an access smart card is present. Answer B is incorrect because
although anonymous access is a possibility, as a publicly funded institution, the library
should have some due diligence to prevent the use of the computer for illegal purpos-
es. Answers C and D are incorrect; these types of authentication are extremely expen-
sive and restrictive for access to library resources.
24. Answer: C. The highest levels of authentication may involve not only account logon,
but also where the logon is occurring from (specific network addresses) or whether a
security token such as an access smart card is present. Most governmental financial
systems would require some type of biometric verification and a security token.
Answers A, B, and D are incorrect; they are not restrictive enough. Anonymous or
open access represents the weakest possible form of authentication, whereas the
requirement for both a logon identifier and password combination may be considered
the most basic of actual account verification.
25. Answer: B. Millions of travelers access kiosks at airports daily. Although anonymous
access is the weakest possible form of authentication, it is the only solution due to the
volume of traffic. Whereas the requirement for both a logon identifier and password
combination may be considered the most basic of actual account verification, requir-
ing each traveler to use a login and password would create an unbearable backlog of
travelers. Answer A is incorrect. Issuing security tokens is not cost-effective or admin-
istratively manageable in a kiosk environment. Answers C and D are incorrect; these
types of authentication are extremely expensive and restrictive for access to airport
kiosks.
26. Answer: A. Before access rights can be determined, a user must first be authenticat-
ed. Answer B is incorrect because the processes of authentication and access rights
determination are not explicitly dependent on one another. Answers C and D are incor-
rect; authentication must precede access rights determination to avoid granting an
unauthorized account access rights.
27. Answer: B. Authentication is the mechanism by which the unique identity is associat-
ed with a security principal (a specific user or service). Answer A is incorrect because
it describes identification, which is the presentation of a unique identity. Answer C is
incorrect; it is a description of identification. Identification presents credentials.
Answer D is incorrect because it describes access control. Access control provides a
set of resources available to the authenticated identity.
28. Answer: C, D. To reduce user support and authentication complexity, a single sign-on
(SSO) capable of granting access to all services is desirable. SSO solutions may
employ a central directory service like Microsoft’s Active Directory or Novell’s
eDirectory service, or may sequester services behind a series of proxy applications as
in the Service-Oriented Architecture approach. Answer A is incorrect because imple-
menting single sign-on solutions can be costly. Answer B is incorrect. When single
sign-on is used, if an account is compromised, more resources are at risk.
29. Answer: D. Most access for telecommuters will involve not only account logon, but
also when the logon is occurring from specific network addresses or whether a securi-
ty token such as an access smart card is present. Answer A is incorrect; the require-
ment for both a logon identifier and password combination may be considered the

Domain 5.0: Access Control and Identity Management
305
most basic of actual account verification and not strong enough for home users with
always-on network connections. Answer B is incorrect. Anonymous access is a very
weak solution for home users with always-on network connectors and should not be
used. Answers C is incorrect; this type of authentication is extremely expensive and
does not make sense for the users.
30. Answer: A. To reduce user support and authentication complexity, a single sign-on
(SSO) capable of granting access to all services is desirable. Based on the previous
information, answer B is incorrect. Anonymous access is a very weak solution for
home users with always-on network connectors and should not be used. Answers C
and D are incorrect because neither administrative nor anonymous access should be
used.
31. Answer: A. Mandatory access control, which is the most basic form of access control,
involves the assignment of labels to resources and accounts. If the labels on the
account and resource do not match, the resource remains unavailable in a nondiscre-
tionary manner. Answer B is incorrect. In discretionary access control, a subject has
complete control over the objects that it owns. The owner assigns security levels
based on objects and subjects. Answer C is incorrect because in a role-based access
control scenario, access rights are first assigned to roles, and accounts are then
assigned these roles without direct assignment of resource access rights. Answer D is
incorrect. In a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by account,
by time of day, or through other forms of conditional testing.
32. Answer: B. In discretionary access control, a subject has complete control over the
objects that it owns. The owner assigns security levels based on objects and subjects.
Answer A is incorrect. Mandatory access control, which is the most basic form of
access control, involves the assignment of labels to resources and accounts. If the

In a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of
day, or through other forms of conditional testing.
33. Answer: D. In a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by
account, by time of day, or through other forms of conditional testing. The most com-
mon form of rule-based access control involves testing against an access control list
(ACL) that details systems and accounts with access rights and the limits of its access
for the resource. Answer A is incorrect. Mandatory access control is the most basic
form of access control and involves the assignment of labels to resources and
accounts. If the labels on the account and resource do not match, the resource
remains unavailable in a nondiscretionary manner. Answer B is incorrect. In discre-
tionary access control, a subject has complete control over the objects it owns. The
owner assigns security levels based on objects and subjects. Answer C is incorrect
because in a role-based access control scenario, access rights are first assigned to
roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles without direct assignment of

remains unavailable in a nondiscretionary manner. Answer B is incorrect. In discre-
tionary access control, a subject has complete control over the objects that it owns.
The owner assigns security levels based on objects and subjects. Answer C is incor-
rect because in a role-based access control scenario, access rights are first assigned
to roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles without direct assignment of
resource access rights.
35. Answer: A. Mandatory access control is the most basic form of access control and
involves the assignment of labels to resources and accounts. This type of access con-
trol is often used within governmental systems where resources and access may be
granted based on categorical assignment, such as classified, secret, or top secret.
Answer B is incorrect. In discretionary access control, a subject has complete control
over the objects that it owns. The owner assigns security levels based on objects and
subjects. Answer C is incorrect because in a role-based access control scenario,
access rights are first assigned to roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles
without direct assignment of resource access rights. Answer D is incorrect. In a rule-
based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of day, or
through other forms of conditional testing.
36. Answer: C. In a role-based access control scenario, access rights are first assigned to
roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles without direct assignment of
resource access rights. This type of access is used with groups for inheritance by
group member account. Answer A is incorrect because mandatory access control
involves the assignment of labels to resources and accounts. If the labels on the
account and resource do not match, the resource remains unavailable in a nondiscre-
tionary manner. Answer B is incorrect. In discretionary access control, a subject has
complete control over the objects that it owns. The owner assigns security levels
based on objects and subjects. Answer D is incorrect. In a rule-based access control
solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of day, or through other forms of
conditional testing.
37. Answer: A, C. A mandatory access control solution involving labels such as DONOR
and DISPLAY would suffice for the user access assignment. A role-based access con-
trol solution involving the roles of User and Donor would also be appropriate. Answer
B is incorrect because the complexity of assigning by-user access rights over each
item’s files would involve a large amount of administrative overhead. Answer D is
incorrect because the complexity of the requirement is not great enough to involve
detailed conditional testing.
38. Answer: D. A rule-based access control solution would allow detailed conditional test-
ing of the user’s account type and the time of day and day of the week to allow or
deny access. Answers A and B are incorrect because both solutions do not allow for
conditional testing. Answer C is also incorrect because role-based access control

Domain 5.0: Access Control and Identity Management
307
involves testing against role-assigned access rights, rather than by other qualities
such as a test for normal working hours.
39. Answer: A, B. The TCSEC specification identifies levels of security based on the mini-
mum level of access control used in a network environment by divisions and classes.
The four divisions of access control are division D, which is Minimal; division C, which
is Discretionary; division B, which is Mandatory; and division A, which is Verified.
Category A is the highest level, essentially encompassing all elements of Category B,
in addition to formal design and verification techniques. Answers C and D are incor-
rect; they describe network design methods.
40. Answer: C. The TCSEC specification identifies levels of security based on the mini-
mum level of access control used in a network environment. The four divisions of
access control are division D, which is Minimal; division C, which is Discretionary;
division B, which is Mandatory; and division A, which is Verified. Category A is the
highest level, essentially encompassing all elements of Category B, in addition to for-
mal design and verification techniques. Based in the preceding statement, answers A,
B, and D are incorrect.
41. Answer: A. In a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by
account, by time of day, or through other forms of conditional testing. The most com-
mon form of rule-based access control involves testing against an access control list
(ACL) that details systems and accounts with access rights and the limits of its access
for the resource. Answer B is incorrect. In group-based access control, permissions
are assigned to groups, and user accounts become members of the groups. Answer C
is incorrect because in a role-based access control scenario, access rights are first
assigned to roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles without direct assign-
ment of resource access rights. Answer D is incorrect. In a user-based model, permis-
sions are uniquely assigned to each account.

based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of day, or
through other forms of conditional testing.
45. Answer: C. In role-based access control, rather than providing a mechanism for direct
assignment of rights to an account, access rights are assigned to roles, and accounts
are then assigned these roles. This solution provides the greatest level of scalability
within large enterprise scenarios, where the explicit granting of rights would rapidly
incur a significant level of administrative overhead, and the potential for accidental
grant of permissions beyond those needed becomes very high. Answer A is incorrect.
In a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of
day, or through other forms of conditional testing. The most common form of rule-
based access control involves testing against an access control list (ACL) that details
systems and accounts with access rights and the limits of its access for the resource.
Answer B is incorrect. In group-based access control, permissions are assigned to
groups, and user accounts become members of the groups. Answer D is incorrect. In
a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each account.
46. Answer: B. The smart card is an example of “what you have,” and the biometric meas-
ures are an example of “what you are.” Answer A is incorrect because there are no
biometrics relating to the action “what you do,” only simple measurements of bodily
configuration. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason—there is no “what you do”
metric present. Answer C is incorrect because no PIN or password is employed as a
“what you know” factor. 
47. Answer: C. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card is used by U.S. federal
employees and contractors under HSPD 12. Answer A is incorrect because A, B, and C
are all smart card variations but only C is specifically used for federal employees and
contractors under HSPD 12. Answer B is incorrect because the Common Access Card
(CAC) is used by the U.S. military, the military reserve, and military contractors.
Answer D is incorrect because the RSA SecureID is an example of a time-shifting key
token.
48. Answer: B. The Common Access Card (CAC) is used by the U.S. military, the military
reserve, and military contractors. Answer A is incorrect because it is a generic smart
card variation. Answer C is incorrect because the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
Card is used by U.S. federal employees and contractors under HSPD 12. Answer D is
incorrect because the RSA SecureID is an example of a time-shifting key token.
49. Answer: D. The correct order of operations is the authentication of provided creden-
tials or keys, followed by authorization of the presented credentials, and finally, the
application of access controls. Answer A is incorrect because the accounting of access

Domain 5.0: Access Control and Identity Management
309
is a function of the authentication and authorization service rather than a required
operation. Answer B is incorrect because identification is included along with authenti-
cation, and authorization is missing. Answer C is incorrect because identification
involves only the presentation of credentials and not the requirement for verifying
those credentials as valid. 
50. Answer: A. Retinal biometric identification involves the scanning and identification of
blood vessels and tissues in the back of the eye. Answer B is incorrect because iris
biometric systems analyze only the external colored part of the eye around the pupil.
Answer C is incorrect because signature biometric analysis involves the motions and
patterns of a written signature rather than those of the back of the eye. Answer D is
incorrect because facial recognition systems measure the overall proportions of facial
features and bones.
Objective 5.3: Implement appropriate 
security controls when performing account
management.
1. Answer: B. In its broadest sense, an access control list (ACL) is the underlying data
associated with a network resource that defines the access permissions. The most
common privileges include the ability to read, write to, delete, and execute a file.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes logical access control. Logical access con-
trols are used in addition to physical security controls to limit access to data. This
helps ensure the integrity of information, preserve the confidentiality of data, and
maintain the availability of information. Answer C is incorrect because it describes
Group Policy. Group Policy enables you to set consistent common security standards
for a certain group of computers, enforce common computer and user configurations,
simplify computer configuration by distributing applications, and restrict the distribu-
tion of applications that may have limited licenses. Answer D is incorrect because it
describes a security identifier. A security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identi-
fies a security principal. A SID is issued to every security principal when it is created.

3. Answer: D. A security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a security princi-
pal. An SID is issued to every security principal when it is created. A user’s access
token includes SIDs of all groups to which the user is a member. When a user logs on
and authentication is successful, the logon process returns an SID for the user and a
list of SIDs for the user’s security groups. The access token is comprised of these 
elements. Answer A is incorrect because it describes logical access control. Logical

5. Answer: A. Implementation of access management is based on one of two models:
centralized or decentralized. Both the group-based and role-based methods of access
control have a centralized database of accounts and roles or groups to which the
accounts are assigned. Decentralized security management is less secure but more
scalable. Responsibilities are delegated, and employees at different locations are made
responsible for managing privileges within their administrative areas. Answers B and C
are incorrect; a decentralized solution is less secure than a centralized model. Answer
D is incorrect; a decentralized model is more scalable, not less scalable.

7. Answer: D. The order of GPO processing is important because a policy applied later
overwrites a policy applied earlier. Group policies get applied from the bottom up, so if
there is a conflict, the policy higher up in the list will prevail, unless it meets one of the
exceptions, such as block inheritance and loopback. Based on the previous statement,
answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
8. Answer: C. Recommendations for setting a good password policy include making the
password length at least eight characters and require the use of uppercase and lower-
case letters, numbers, and special characters. Answers A and B are incorrect because
the length is too short and they can easily be compromised. Answer D is incorrect
because although it would create a secure password, the length is too long for the
average user to remember, causing users to write them down.
9. Answer: A. When Group Policy configures these settings, keep in mind that you can
have only one domain account policy. The policy is applied at the root of the domain
and becomes the policy for any system that is a member of the domain in Windows
Server 2008 and earlier server versions. Domain password policies affect all users in
the domain. The effectiveness of these policies depends on how and where they are
applied. Based on this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
10. Answer: A, B, D. Good password policies include making the password length at least
eight characters; requiring the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
special characters; requiring users to change passwords every 60 to 90 days; and set-
ting the server to not allow users to use the same password over and over again.
Answer C is incorrect because locking out user accounts after two failed logon
attempts will cause undue stress on the help desk staff. Best practice for failed logon
attempts is to lock out after three to five bad logon attempts.

ees are using computers only during specified hours. This setting is useful for organi-
zations where users require supervision, security certification requires it, or employees
are mainly temporary or shift workers. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because all
these options affect all employees, not shift workers exclusively.
12. Answer: D. In Microsoft operating systems, each ACL has one or more access control
entries (ACEs). These are descriptors that contain the name of a user, group, or role.
The access privileges are stated in a string of bits called an access mask. Generally,
the object owner or the system administrator creates the ACL for an object. Answer A
is incorrect because it describes logical access control. Logical access controls are
used in addition to physical security controls to limit access to data. This helps ensure
the integrity of information, preserve the confidentiality of data, and maintain the avail-
ability of information. Answer B is incorrect because it describes Group Policy. Group
Policy enables you to set consistent common security standards for a certain group of
computers, enforce common computer and user configurations, simplify computer
configuration by distributing applications, and restrict the distribution of applications
that may have limited licenses. Answer C is incorrect because it describes a security
identifier. A security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a security princi-
pal. A SID is issued to every security principal when it is created.

13. Answer: C. Implementation of access management is based on one of two models:
centralized or decentralized. Both the group-based and role-based methods of access
control have a centralized database of accounts and roles or groups to which the
accounts are assigned. Decentralized security management is less secure but more
scalable. Responsibilities are delegated and employees at different locations are made
responsible for managing privileges within their administrative areas. Answer A is
incorrect because in a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each
account. Answer B is incorrect because in a centralized model, there is one central
database of accounts and roles or groups to which the accounts are assigned. Answer
D is incorrect because a group-based access method of access control is centralized.
14. Answer: B, D. Implementation of access management is based on one of two models:
centralized or decentralized. Both the group-based and role-based methods of access
control have a centralized database of accounts and roles or groups to which the
accounts are assigned. Decentralized security management is less secure but more
scalable. Responsibilities are delegated and employees at different locations are made
responsible for managing privileges within their administrative areas. Answer A is
incorrect because in a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each
account. Answer C is incorrect because in a decentralized model, responsibilities are
delegated and employees at different locations are made responsible for managing
privileges within their administrative areas.
15. Answer: A. If the computer is a workgroup member rather than a domain member,
only the local policy is applied. Based on the previous statement, answers B, C, and D
are incorrect. If the computer is a workgroup member, it does not matter what policies
are set; only the local policy will apply.
16. Answer: A, B, C. GPOs can be associated with or linked to sites, domains, or organi-
zational units. Because Group Policy is so powerful, various levels of administrative
roles can be appointed. These include creating, modifying, and linking policies.
Answer D is incorrect; forests transverse across domains, and Group Policy is not
linked to a forest.
17. Answer: D. The order of GPO processing is important because a policy applied later
overwrites a policy applied earlier. Group policies get applied from the bottom up;
however, if there is a conflict, the policy higher up in the list will prevail. Based on the
previous statements, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
18. Answer: C. You can assign time-of-day restrictions as a means to ensure that employ-
ees are using computers only during specified hours. This setting is useful for organi-
zations where users require supervision, security certification requires it, or employees
are mainly temporary or shift workers. Answer A is incorrect because the account
expiration attribute specifies when an account expires. This setting may be used under
the same conditions as the time-of-day restrictions. Answer B is incorrect because the
account lockout policy can be used to secure the system against attacks by disabling
the account after a certain number of attempts, for a certain period of time. Answer D
is incorrect because the software restriction policy has to do with application installa-
tions.
19. Answer: A. The account expiration attribute specifies when an account expires. This
setting may be used under the same conditions as the time-of-day restrictions.

Answer B is incorrect because the account lockout policy can be used to secure the
system against attacks by disabling the account after a certain number of attempts, for
a certain period of time. Answer C is incorrect. You can assign time-of-day restrictions
as a means to ensure that employees are using computers only during specified
hours. This setting is useful for organizations where users require supervision, securi-
ty certification requires it, or employees are mainly temporary or shift workers.
Answer D is incorrect because the software restriction policy has to do with applica-
tion installations.
20. Answer: B. The account lockout policy can be used to secure the system against
attacks by disabling the account after a certain number of attempts, for a certain peri-
od of time. Answer A is incorrect. The account expiration attribute specifies when an
account expires. This setting may be used under the same conditions as the time-of-
day restrictions. Answer C is incorrect. You can assign time-of-day restrictions as a
means to ensure that employees are using computers only during specified hours.
This setting is useful for organizations where users require supervision, security certi-
fication requires it, or employees are mainly temporary or shift workers. Answer D is
incorrect because the software restriction policy has to do with application installa-
tions.
21. Answer: A, B, C. A user account holds information about the specific user. It can con-
tain basic information such as name, password, and the level of permission the user
has. Answer D is incorrect because devices are not included in user account informa-
tion. Device information is more closely associated with SNMP tracking.
22. Answer: C. The internal user has the greatest access to data and the opportunity to
either deliberately sabotage it or accidentally delete it. Although partnering vendors,
contract workers, and external users have the opportunity to damage data, they do not
have enough permission to accidentally delete data, nor do they have access to data
as readily as internal users do. Based on this information, answers A, B, and D are
incorrect.
23. Answer: B. Active Directory Services provides flexibility by allowing two types of
groups: security groups and distribution groups. Security groups are used to assign
rights and permissions to groups for resource access. Distribution groups are
assigned to a user list for applications or non-security-related functions. For example,
a distribution group can be used by Microsoft Exchange to distribute mail. Answers A
and D are incorrect because these groups do not exist. Answer C is incorrect because
security groups are used to assign rights and permissions to groups for resource
access.
24. Answer: A, B, C, D. Users can be placed in universal, global, domain, or local groups.
25. Answer: D. Within a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each
account. One example of this is a peer-to-peer network or a workgroup where access
is granted based on individual needs. Answer A is incorrect; in a rule-based access
control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of day, or through other
forms of conditional testing. Answer B is incorrect; in group-based access control,
permissions are assigned to groups, and user accounts become members of the
groups. Answer C is incorrect because in role-based access control, rather than pro-
viding a mechanism for direct assignment of rights to an account, access rights are
assigned to roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles.

26. Answer: B. In group-based access control, permissions are assigned to groups, and
user accounts become members of the groups. Access control over large numbers of
user accounts can be more easily accomplished by managing the access permissions
on each group, which are then inherited by the group’s members. Answer A is incor-
rect; in a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by
time of day, or through other forms of conditional testing. Answer C is incorrect
because in role-based access control, rather than providing a mechanism for direct
assignment of rights to an account, access rights are assigned to roles, and accounts
are then assigned these roles. Answer D is incorrect; within a user-based model, per-
missions are uniquely assigned to each account. One example of this is a peer-to-peer
network or a workgroup where access is granted based on individual needs.
27. Answer: C. Active Directory Services provides flexibility by allowing two types of
groups: security groups and distribution groups. Security groups are used to assign
rights and permissions to groups for resource access. Answers A and D are incorrect
because these groups do not exist. Answer B is incorrect because distribution groups
are assigned to a user list for applications or non-security-related functions.
28. Answer: B, D. The user rights assignment is twofold: It can grant specific privileges,
and it can grant logon rights to users and groups in your computing environment.
Logon rights control who and how users log on to the computer, such as the right to
log on to a system locally, whereas privileges allow users to perform system tasks,
such as the right to back up files and directories. Answers A and C are incorrect
because the user rights assignment has nothing to do with segregation of users or
resources; that is more of an access control function.
29. Answer: D. Within a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each
account. One example of this is a peer-to-peer network or a workgroup where access
is granted based on individual needs. Answer A is incorrect; in a rule-based access
control solution, access rights may vary by account, by time of day, or through other
forms of conditional testing. Answer B is incorrect; in group-based access control,
permissions are assigned to groups, and user accounts become members of the
groups. Answer C is incorrect because in role-based access control, rather than pro-
viding a mechanism for direct assignment of rights to an account, access rights are
assigned to roles, and accounts are then assigned these roles. 
30. Answer: B. In group-based access control, permissions are assigned to groups, and
user accounts become members of the groups. Access control over large numbers of
user accounts can be more easily accomplished by managing the access permissions
on each group, which are then inherited by the group’s members. Answer A is incor-
rect; in a rule-based access control solution, access rights may vary by account, by
time of day, or through other forms of conditional testing. Answer C is incorrect
because in role-based access control, rather than providing a mechanism for direct
assignment of rights to an account, access rights are assigned to roles, and accounts
are then assigned these roles. Answer D is incorrect; within a user-based model, per-
missions are uniquely assigned to each account. One example of this is a peer-to-peer
network or a workgroup where access is granted based on individual needs.

Domain 5.0: Access Control and Identity Management

31. Answer: A, D. The user rights assignment is twofold: It can grant specific privileges,
and it can grant logon rights to users and groups in your computing environment.
Logon rights control who and how users log on to the computer, such as the right to
log on to a system locally, whereas permissions allow users to perform system tasks,
such as the right to back up files and directories. Answers B and C are incorrect
because they state the exact opposite of what is true.
32. Answer: B. When working with groups, remember a few key items. No matter what
OS you are working with, if you are giving a user full access in one group and no
access in another group, the result will be no access. However, group permissions are
cumulative, so if a user belongs to two groups and one has more liberal access, the
user will have the more liberal access, except where the no access right is involved.
Therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answers C and D are incorrect because the user
would either have full access or no access; read and write are not mentioned in the
question.
33. Answer: D. Group permissions are cumulative, so if a user belongs to two groups and
one has more liberal access, the user will have the more liberal access, except where
the no access right is involved. For example, write access has more privileges than
just read access. No matter what OS you are working with, if you are giving a user full
access in one group and no access in another group, the result will be no access.
Therefore, answers A and B are incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because permissions
are cumulative.
34. Answer: A. Although permissions can apply to individual user accounts, they are best
administered by using group accounts. Answer B is incorrect because applying per-
missions to individual accounts creates administrative overhead and is not good prac-
tice. Answers C and D are incorrect because in a domain environment, users are
placed in groups, and then permissions are set.
35. Answer: C. The administrative account should be used only for the purpose of
“administering the server”. Based on the previous statement, answers A, B, and D are
incorrect.

Domain 6.0:
Cryptography
Recently, modern cryptography has become increasingly
important and ubiquitous. There has been increasing concern
about the security of data, which continues to rapidly grow
across information systems and traverse and reside in many
different locations. This combined with more sophisticated
attacks and a growing economy around computer-related
fraud and data theft makes the need to protect the data itself
even more important than in the past. A public key infrastruc-
ture (PKI) makes use of both public and private keys. It also
provides the foundation for binding keys to an identity via a
certificate authority (CA), thus providing the system for the
secure exchange of data over a network through the use of an
asymmetric key system. This system for the most part consists
of digital certificates and the CAs that issue the certificates.
These certificates identify individuals, systems, and organiza-
tions that have been verified as authentic and trustworthy. As
a prospective security professional, you should also take every
opportunity you may find to expand your skill base beyond
these basic foundational elements. The following list includes
the key areas from Domain 6 (which counts as 11% of the
exam) that you need to master for the exam:
. Summarize general cryptography concepts
. Use and apply appropriate cryptographic tools and
products
. Explain core concepts of public key infrastructure
. Implement PKI, certificate management, and associated
components

Answers and Explanations
Objective 6.1: Summarize general 
cryptography concepts.
1. Answer: C. A cryptography key describes a string of bits, which are used for encrypt-
ing and decrypting data. These keys can also be thought of as a password or table.
Answer A is incorrect because it describes encryption. Encryption takes plaintext data
and converts it into an unreadable format (ciphertext) by using an algorithm (cipher).
Answer B is incorrect because it describes steganography. Steganography is a method
for hiding messages so that unintended recipients aren’t even aware of any message.
Answer D is incorrect; an algorithm is the mathematical procedure or sequence of
steps taken to perform encryption and decryption.
2. Answer: B. Steganography is a method for hiding messages so that unintended 
recipients aren’t even aware of any message. Answer A is incorrect because it
describes encryption. Encryption takes plaintext data and converts it into an unread-
able format (ciphertext) by using an algorithm (cipher). Answer C is incorrect because
it describes a cryptography key. A cryptography key is a string of bits, which are used
for encrypting and decrypting data. Answer D is incorrect; an algorithm is the mathe-
matical procedure or sequence of steps taken to perform encryption and decryption.
3. Answer: D. An algorithm is the mathematical procedure or sequence of steps taken 
to perform encryption and decryption. Answer A is incorrect because it describes
encryption. Encryption takes plaintext data and converts it into an unreadable format
(ciphertext) by using an algorithm (cipher). Answer B is incorrect because it describes
steganography. Steganography is a method for hiding messages so that unintended
recipients aren’t even aware of any message. Answer C is incorrect because it
describes a cryptography key. A cryptography key is a string of bits, which are used
for encrypting and decrypting data.
4. Answer: A. Encryption takes plaintext data and converts it into an unreadable format
(ciphertext) by using an algorithm (cipher). Answer B is incorrect because it describes
steganography. Steganography is a method for hiding messages so that unintended
recipients aren’t even aware of any message. Answer C is incorrect because it
describes a cryptography key. A cryptography key is a string of bits, which are used
for encrypting and decrypting data. Answer D is incorrect; an algorithm is the mathe-
matical procedure or sequence of steps taken to perform encryption and decryption.
5. Answer: A, C. There are growing concerns over the security of data, which continues
to rapidly grow across information systems and reside in many different locations.
Combining this with more sophisticated attacks and a growing economy around 
computer-related fraud and data theft makes the need to protect the data itself even
more important than in the past. Answers B and D are incorrect; the increase in virus
infections and use of steganography has nothing to do with cryptography.

Domain 6.0: Cryptography

6. Answer: B, D. There are two fundamental types of encryption algorithms: symmetric
key and asymmetric key. Answer A is incorrect. Hashing algorithms are not encryption
methods, but offer additional system security via a “signature” for data confirming the
original content. Answer C is incorrect; Trusted Platform is the name of a published
specification detailing a secure cryptoprocessor that can store cryptographic keys that
protect information.
7. Answer: B. Symmetric key cryptography is an encryption system that uses a common
shared key between the sender and receiver. Answers A and D are incorrect because
hashing is different from encryption. Answer C is incorrect because it describes asym-
metric key cryptography.
8. Answer: C. The asymmetric encryption algorithm has two keys: a public one and a 
private one. Answers A and D are incorrect because hashing is different from encryp-
tion. Answer B is incorrect because it describes symmetric key cryptography.
9. Answer: A. The asymmetric encryption algorithm has two keys: a public one and a 
private one. The public key is made available to whoever is going to encrypt the data
sent to the holder of the private key. Often the public encryption key is made available
in a number of fashions, such as email or centralized servers that host a pseudo
address book of published public encryption keys. Answer B is incorrect because this
is where the private key is stored. Answer C is incorrect because a cryptographic vault
is used for theft resistance. It is a small crypto file system containing all the secrets in
unencrypted form. Answer D is incorrect; the user shared network folder is not used
to store the public key.
10. Answer: B. The asymmetric encryption algorithm has two keys: a public one and a 
private one. The private key is maintained on the host system or application. Answer A
is incorrect because this is where the public key is stored. The public encryption key is
made available in a number of fashions, such as email or centralized servers that host
a pseudo address book of published public encryption keys. Answer C is incorrect
because a cryptographic vault is used for theft resistance. It is a small crypto file 
system containing all the secrets in unencrypted form. Answer D is incorrect; the user
shared network folder is not used to store the public key.
11. Answer: C. Asymmetric algorithms are often referred to as public key algorithms
because of their use of the public key as the focal point for the algorithm. Answers A,
B, and D are incorrect; symmetric key algorithms are often referred to as secret key
algorithms, private key algorithms, and shared secret algorithms.
12. Answer: A, B, D. Symmetric key algorithms are often referred to as secret key 
algorithms, private key algorithms, and shared secret algorithms. Answer C is 
incorrect. Asymmetric algorithms are often referred to as public key algorithms
because of their use of the public key as the focal point for the algorithm.
13. Answer: B. Some general rules for asymmetric algorithms include the following: the
public key can never decrypt a message that it was used to encrypt with, private 
keys should never be able to be determined through the public key (if it is designed
properly), and each key should be able to decrypt a message made with the other. For
instance, if a message is encrypted with the private key, the public key should be able
to decrypt it; therefore, answers A and C are incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because
the public key can never be used to decrypt a message even by an administrator.

14. Answer: A. Some general rules for asymmetric algorithms include the following: the
public key can never decrypt a message that it was used to encrypt with, private keys
should never be able to be determined through the public key (if it is designed 
properly), and each key should be able to decrypt a message made with the other. For
instance, if a message is encrypted with the private key, the public key should be able
to decrypt it; therefore, answers B and C are incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because
the public key can never be used to decrypt a message even by an administrator.
15. Answer: D. Steganography seeks to hide the presence of a message, whereas the 
purpose of cryptography is to transform a message from readable plaintext into an
unreadable form known as ciphertext. Answer A is incorrect because steganography
seeks to hide the presence of a message not expose it. Answers B and C are incorrect
because the descriptions of each are reversed and cryptography has nothing to do
with hiding or exposing hidden messages.
16. Answer: B. Steganography has been used by many printers, using tiny dots that reveal
serial numbers and time stamps. Answer A is incorrect; phishing is the fraudulent
process of attempting to acquire sensitive information. Answer C is incorrect; cryptog-
raphy transforms a message from readable plaintext into an unreadable form known
as ciphertext. Answer D is incorrect; a hash is a generated summary from a mathe-
matical rule or algorithm.
17. Answer: A. When data that is going to be encrypted is broken into chunks of data and
then encrypted, the type of encryption is called a block cipher. Answer B is incorrect
because this describes a public key encryption algorithm. Although many symmetric
algorithms use a block cipher, answer C is incorrect because a block cipher is a more
precise and accurate term for the given question. Answer D is incorrect because hash-
ing does not encrypt.
18. Answer: B. Although many different types of algorithms use public and private keys to
apply their encryption algorithms in their own various ways, algorithms that perform
this way are called asymmetric encryption algorithms (or public key encryption).
Answer C is incorrect because this is only a type of asymmetric encryption algorithm.
Answer A is incorrect because symmetric algorithms use a single key. Answer D is not
a type of algorithm, and so it is incorrect.
19. Answer: D. Nonrepudiation is intended to provide, through encryption, a method of
accountability in which there is not a way to refute where data has been sourced (or
arrived from). Answer A is incorrect because it describes integrity. Answer B is incor-
rect because it describes confidentiality. Answer C is incorrect because it describes
authorization.
20. Answer: B, C, D. The four key elements that nonrepudiation services provide are
proof of origin, proof of submission, proof of delivery, and proof of receipt. Answer A
is incorrect because proof of service is a court paper filed by a process server as 
evidence that the witness or party to the lawsuit was served with the court papers 
as instructed.
21. Answer: D. Digital signatures attempt to guarantee the identity of the person sending
the data from one point to another. Answer A is incorrect; a hash is a generated sum-
mary from a mathematical rule or algorithm. Answer B is incorrect; steganography

seeks to hide the presence of a message. Answer C is incorrect; cryptography trans-
forms a message from readable plaintext into an unreadable form known as ciphertext.
22. Answer: A. Whole disk encryption helps mitigate the risks associated with lost or
stolen laptops and accompanying disclosure laws when the organization is required to
report data breaches. Answer B is incorrect; Trusted Platform Module is the name of a
published specification detailing a secure cryptoprocessor that can store cryptographic
keys that protect information. Answer C is incorrect; digital signatures attempt to
guarantee the identity of the person sending the data from one point to another.
Answer D is incorrect; a hash is a generated summary from a mathematical rule or
algorithm.
23. Answer: D. Quantum cryptography uses photons to transmit a key. After the key is
transmitted, coding and encoding using the normal secret-key method can take place.
Quantum cryptology is the first cryptology that safeguards against passive intercep-
tion. Answer A is incorrect because symmetric algorithms use a single key and do not
safeguard against passive interception. Answers B and C are incorrect because asym-
metric encryption algorithms do not safeguard against passive interception.
24. Answer: C. In most cases, the use of SSL and TLS is single sided. Only the server is
being authenticated as valid with a verifiable certificate. For example, when conducting
an online banking transaction, users can be assured they are at the legitimate site by
verifying the server-side certificate, whereas the client is verified by a means other
than a certificate, such as a username and password. Answer A is incorrect; digital
signatures attempt to guarantee the identity of the person sending the data from one
point to another. Answer B is incorrect; a hash is a generated summary from a mathe-
matical rule or algorithm. Answer D is incorrect; in a dual-sided scenario, not only is
the server authenticated using a certificate, but the client side is as well. This certainly
can provide for a more secure environment, but additional overhead is created.
Furthermore, a unique client side certificate now needs to be created and managed for
every client rather than just a single server.
25. Answer: B. Because of the sensitive nature behind the uses of cryptography, the use
of well-known, proven technologies is crucial. Back doors and flaws, for example, can
undermine any encryption algorithm, which is why proven algorithms should always
be considered. Although various vendors might have their own encryption solutions,
most of these depend upon well-known, time-tested algorithms, and generally speak-
ing, one should be skeptical of any vendor using a proprietary nonproven algorithm.
Therefore, answers C and D are incorrect. Answer A is incorrect; DES is only a 56-bit
encryption key algorithm and is considered weak.
Objective 6.2: Use and apply appropriate
cryptographic tools and products.
1. Answer: B, C. Symmetric algorithms can be classified into either being a block cipher
or a stream cipher. A stream cipher, as the name implies, encrypts the message bit by
bit, one at a time, whereas a block cipher encrypts the message in chunks. Answer A
is incorrect; historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as

344
Chapter 6
classical ciphers. Answer D is incorrect because simple substitution ciphers and 
transposition ciphers are considered classical ciphers.
2. Answer: B. DES is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit key and 8 bits of parity on each
64-bit chuck of data. Based on this information, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
3. Answer: A. Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), also known as Triple-DES, 
dramatically improves upon the DES by using the DES algorithm three times with
three distinct keys. This provides a total effective key length of 168 bits. Based on 
this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
4. Answer: D. RC4 is a stream cipher that uses a 1 to 2048 bits key length. Answers A,
B, and C are incorrect because they are all block ciphers.
5. Answer: B. Blowfish Encryption Algorithm is a block cipher that can encrypt using 
any size chunk of data. Blowfish can also perform encryption with any length 
encryption key up to 448-bits, making it a very flexible and secure symmetric 
encryption algorithm. Answers A and C are incorrect; although they are block 
ciphers, the maximum key length of RC5 is 256 and the maximum key length of
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is 128. Answer D is incorrect; RC4 
is a stream cipher.
6. Answer: C. Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit key
and 8 bits of parity on each 64-bit chuck of data. Answer A is incorrect; with Triple
Data Encryption Standard (3DES), the DES algorithm is used three times with three
distinct keys. This provides a total effective key length of 168 bits. Answer B is incor-
rect; the key length of RC5 is 128 to 256 bits. Answer D is incorrect; the key length of
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is 128 to 256 bits.
7. Answer: A. Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), also known as Triple-DES, 
dramatically improves upon the Data Encryption Standard (DES) by using the DES
algorithm three times with three distinct keys. This provides a total effective key length
of 168 bits. Answer B is incorrect; the key length of RC5 is 128 to 256 bits. Answer C
is incorrect; DES is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit key and 8 bits of parity on each
64-bit chuck of data. Answer D is incorrect; the key length of Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) is 128 to 256 bits.
8. Answer: B, D. The key length of both RC5 and AES is 128 to 256 bits. Answer A 
is incorrect; Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), also known as Triple-DES, 
dramatically improves upon the Data Encryption Standard (DES) by using the DES
algorithm three times with three distinct keys. This provides a total effective key 
length of 168 bits. Answer C is incorrect; DES is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit 
key and 8 bits of parity on each 64-bit chuck of data.
9. Answer: B. There is one type of cipher that perhaps has earned the mark as being
completely unbreakable: one-time pad (OTP). Unfortunately, the OTP currently has the
trade-off of requiring a key as long as the message, thus having significant storage
and transmission costs. Answer A is incorrect; the key length of RC5 is 128 to 256
bits. Answer C is incorrect; the maximum key length of IDEA is 128. Answer D is
incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit key 
and 8 bits of parity on each 64-bit chuck of data.

10. Answer: C. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is similar to Data Encryption
Standard (DES) in that it can create keys from 128-bit to 256-bit in length and can
perform the encryption and decryption of data up to 128-bit chunks of data. Similar to
Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), the data is passed through three layers, each
with a specific task, such as generating random keys based on the data and the bit
strength being used. Based on this information, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
11. Answer: C, D. Because of the additional overhead generated by using one key for
encryption and another for decryption, using asymmetric algorithms requires far more
resources than symmetric algorithms. Answers A and B are incorrect; both ECC and
RSA are asymmetric algorithms.
12. Answer: B. PGP was originally designed to provide for the encryption/decryption of
email, as well as for digitally signing emails. PGP follows the OpenPGP format that
allows using a combination of public key and private key encryption (both asymmetric
and symmetric encryption). Answer A is incorrect; one-time pad (OTP), which is also
called a Vernam-cipher is a crypto algorithm where plaintext is combined with a ran-
dom key. It does not use both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. Answer C is
incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric algorithm only. Answer D 
is incorrect; Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric algorithm only.
13. Answer: A. Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) is a well-known cryptography system used
for encryption and digital signatures. In fact, the RSA algorithm is considered by many
to be the standard for encryption and core technology that secures most business
conducted on the Internet. Answer B is incorrect; Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is
an asymmetric algorithm. Answer C is incorrect. One-time pad (OTP) is one type of
cipher that perhaps has earned the mark as being completely unbreakable. Answer D
is incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric algorithm.
14. Answer: B. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) techniques utilize a method in which
elliptic curves could be used to calculate simple, but very difficult to break, encryption
keys to use in general purpose encryption. One of the key benefits of ECC encryption
algorithms is that they have a very compact design because of the advanced mathe-
matics involved in ECC. Answer A is incorrect. The Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA)
algorithm, named after its inventors at MIT, is considered by many to be the standard
for encryption and core technology that secures most business conducted on the
Internet, but it is not as compact in design nor does it use the advanced mathematics
that ECC does. Answer C is incorrect; although the one-time pad (OTP) is one type of
cipher that perhaps has earned the mark as being completely unbreakable, the design
is not compact because plaintext is combined with a random key, requiring a key as
long as the message. Answer D is incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a sym-
metric algorithm. Although symmetric algorithms tend to be a bit more compact, they
do not contain the advanced mathematics that ECC does. 
15. Answer: B. There is one type of cipher that perhaps has earned the mark as being
completely unbreakable: one-time pad (OTP). Unfortunately, the OTP currently has the
trade-off of requiring a key as long as the message, thus having significant storage
and transmission costs. Answer A is incorrect; the key length of RC5 is a set length of
128 to 256 bits. Answer C is incorrect; the maximum set key length of IDEA is 128
bits. Answer D is incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that uses
a 56-bit key and 8 bits of parity on each 64-bit chuck of data. As with answers A and

346
Chapter 6
C, the bit length is set. None of the incorrect answers allow the overhead to be as high
as OTP because the key length is set, in contrast to being equal to the length of the
message. 
16. Answer: C. RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD) was 
developed within the academic system and is based on the design of MD4. The more
commonly used 160-bit version of the algorithm, RIPEMD-160, performs comparable
to SHA-1, although it is used less often. Answer A is incorrect because the Secure
Hash Algorithm (SHA0 family of hash algorithms was pioneered by the National
Security Agency and widely used in the U.S. government. Answer B is incorrect
because the Message Digest Series Algorithm (MD2, MD4, MD5) series of encryption
algorithms was created by Ronald Rivest (founder of RSA Data Security, Inc.). Answer
D is incorrect; the NT LAN Manager hash (NTLM hash, also called the Unicode hash
was developed for use by Microsoft.
17. Answer: B. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was originally designed to provide for the
encryption/decryption of email, as well as for digitally signing emails. PGP follows 
the OpenPGP format using a combination of public key and private key encryption.
Answer A is incorrect. One-time pad (OTP) is one type of cipher that perhaps has
earned the mark as being completely unbreakable but is used for authentication, not
mail encryption. Answer C is incorrect; Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmet-
ric algorithm used for data encryption, not email. Answer D is incorrect; Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric algorithm most effectively used in wireless
communications and in devices with low computing power or resources.
18. Answer: C. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) supports key lengths of 128, 192,
and 256 bits; many commercial offerings, to encrypt laptops or USB sticks for exam-
ple, supply AES at the maximum 256-bit key length. Based on this information,
answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
19. Answer: D. TKIP uses the RC4 algorithm and does not require an upgrade to existing
hardware. Based on this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
20. Answer: D. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) uses the RC4 cipher for confidentiality;
however, the WEP algorithm, although still widely used, is no longer considered
secure and has been replaced. Based on this information, answers A, B, and C are
incorrect.
21. Answer: B. A hash is a generated summary from a mathematical rule or algorithm and
is used commonly as a “digital fingerprint” to verify the integrity of files and messages
as well as to ensure message integrity and provide authentication verification. Answer
A is incorrect; encryption takes plaintext data and converts it into an unreadable for-
mat (ciphertext) by using an algorithm (cipher). Answer C is incorrect because a cryp-
tography key describes a string of bits, which are used for encrypting and decrypting
data. Answer D is incorrect. An algorithm is the mathematical procedure or sequence
of steps taken to perform a variety of functions. Hashing and encryption are examples
of how algorithms can be used.
22. Answer: C. Hash functions work by taking a string (for example, a password or email)
of any length, and producing a fixed-length string for output. Based on this informa-
tion, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.

23. Answer: D. Although you can create a hash from a document, you cannot re-create
the document from the hash. Keep in mind that hashing is a one-way function. Based
on this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
24. Answer: A. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA, SHA-1) are hash algorithms pioneered by
the National Security Agency and widely used in the U.S. government. SHA-1 can gen-
erate a 160-bit hash from any variable length string of data, making it very secure but
also resource intensive. Based on this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
25. Answer: C. Message Digest Series Algorithms MD2, MD4, and MD5 are a series of
encryption algorithms created by Ronald Rivest (founder of RSA Data Security, Inc.),
that are designed to be fast, simple, and secure. The MD series generates a hash of up
to a 128-bit strength out of any length of data. Based on this information, answers A,
B, and D are incorrect.
26. Answer: B. A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is similar to a hash function. The
MAC is a small piece of data known as an authentication tag, which is derived by
applying a message or file combined with a secret key to a cryptographic algorithm.
The resulting MAC value can ensure the integrity of the data as well as its authenticity,
because a user in possession of the secret key can subsequently detect if there are
any changes from the original. Answer A is incorrect because it describes symmetric
encryption. Answer C is incorrect because it describes asymmetric encryption. Answer
D is incorrect because it describes the Secure Hash Algorithm.
27. Answer: A, C. The two primary weaknesses of LM hash are first, that all passwords
longer than seven characters are broken down into two chunks, from which each piece
is hashed separately. Second, before the password is hashed, all lowercase characters
are converted to uppercase characters. Answers B and D are incorrect; LM hashes
have nothing to do with encryption keys.
28. Answer: D. A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is similar to a hash function, but it
is able to resist forgery and is not open to man-in-the-middle attacks. A MAC can be
thought of as an encrypted hash, combining an encryption key and a hashing algo-
rithm. Based on this information, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
29. Answer: B. Both SHA and the MD series are similar in design; however, keep in mind
that because of the higher bit strength of the SHA-2 algorithm, it will be in the range
of 20% to 30% slower to process than the MD family of algorithms; therefore, answer
A is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect; LM hash is based on DES encryption. Answer D
is incorrect; NTLMv2 hashing makes use of the MD hashing algorithm.
30. Answer: D. NTLMv2 hashing makes use of the MD4 and MD5 hashing algorithms and
is used on more recent versions of the Windows operating system. Answers A and B
are incorrect; MD5 and SHA are typically not used in place of NTLMv2. Answer C is
incorrect; the NTLM hash is an improvement over the LM hash. LM hash is based on
DES encryption, yet it is not considered to be effective (and is technically not truly a
hashing algorithm) due to a weaknesses in the design implementation.

Objective 6.3: Explain core concepts of 
public key infrastructure.
1. Answer: B. A public key infrastructure is a vast collection of varying technologies and
policies for the creation and use of digital certificates. Answer A is incorrect because it
describes the X.509 standard. Answer C is incorrect because it describes Public Key
Cryptography Standards (PKCS). Answer D is incorrect because it describes public key
infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX).
2. Answer: A. In a certificate trust model, everybody’s certificate is issued by a third
party called the certificate authority (CA). If the CA is trusted, the certificates that the
CA issues are automatically trusted. Answer B is incorrect; certificate authorities (CAs)
are trusted entities and are an important concept within PKI. The CA’s job is to issue
certificates, as well as to verify the holder of a digital certificate and ensure that the
holder of the certificate is who they claim to be. Answer C is incorrect because a regis-
tration authority (RA) provides authentication to the CA as to the validity of a client’s
certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as an aggregator of information. Answer
D is incorrect; a certificate practice statement (CPS) is a legal document created and
published by a CA for the purpose of conveying information to those depending on the
CA’s issued certificates.
3. Answer: C. The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are the de facto crypto-
graphic message standards developed and published by RSA Laboratories. Answer B
is incorrect because it describes a public key infrastructure (PKI). Answer A is incor-
rect because it describes the X.509 standard. Answer D is incorrect because it
describes public key infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX).
4. Answer: C. A registration authority (RA) provides authentication to the CA as to the
validity of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as an aggregator of
information. Answer A is incorrect because in a certificate trust model, everybody’s
certificate is issued by a third party called the certificate authority (CA). If the CA is
trusted, the certificates that the CA issues are automatically trusted. Answer B is incor-
rect; certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted entities and are an important concept
within PKI. The CA’s job is to issue certificates, as well as to verify the holder of a 
digital certificate and ensure that the holder of the certificate is who they claim to 
be. Answer D is incorrect; a certificate practice statement (CPS) is a legal document
created and published by a CA for the purpose of conveying information to those
depending on the CA’s issued certificates.
5. Answer: A. The validity period identifies the time frame for which the private key is
valid, if the private key has not been compromised. This period is indicated with both a
start and an end time, and may be of any duration, but it is often set to one year.
Based on this information, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
6. Answer: B, C, D. Information about the signature algorithm identifier, user’s public
key, and serial number of the issuing certificate authority (CA) is included within a 
digital certificate. A user’s private key should never be contained within the digital 
certificate and should remain under tight control; therefore, answer A is incorrect.

7. Answer: B. Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted entities and are an important con-
cept within public key infrastructure (PKI). The CA’s job is to issue certificates, as well
as to verify the holder of a digital certificate, and ensure that the holder of the certifi-
cate is who they claim to be. Answer A is incorrect because in a certificate trust
model, everybody’s certificate is issued by a third party called certificate authority
(CA). If the CA is trusted, the certificates that the CA issues are automatically trusted.
Answer C is incorrect because a registration authority (RA) provides authentication to
the CA as to the validity of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as
an aggregator of information. Answer D is incorrect; a certificate practice statement
(CPS) is a legal document created and published by a CA for the purpose of conveying
information to those depending on the CA’s issued certificates.
8. Answer: A. The X.509 standard defines a framework for authentication services by a
directory and the format of required data for digital certificates. Answer B is incorrect
because it describes a public key infrastructure (PKI). Answer C is incorrect because it
describes Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS). Answer D is incorrect because
it describes public key infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX).
9. Answer: D. A certificate practice statement (CPS) is a legal document created and
published by a CA for the purpose of conveying information to those depending on the
CA’s issued certificates. Answer A is incorrect because in a certificate trust model,
everybody’s certificate is issued by a third party called a certificate authority (CA). If
one trusts the CA, he automatically trusts the certificates that CA issues. Answer B is
incorrect; certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted entities and are an important concept
within PKI. The CA’s job is to issue certificates, as well as to verify the holder of a 
digital certificate, and ensure that the holder of the certificate is who they claim to be.
Answer C is incorrect because a registration authority (RA) provides authentication to
the CA as to the validity of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as
an aggregator of information.
10. Answer: D. Public key infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX) describes the development of
Internet standards for X.509-based public key infrastructure (PKI). Answer B is incor-
rect because it describes a PKI. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the X.509
standard. Answer C is incorrect because it describes Public Key Cryptography
Standards (PKCS).
11. Answer: A, D. A registration authority (RA) provides authentication to the CA as to the
validity of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as an aggregator of
information. Answer B is incorrect because a certificate practice statement (CPS) is a
legal document created and published by a CA for the purpose of conveying informa-
tion to those depending on the CA’s issued certificates. Answer C is incorrect because
the CA’s job is to issue certificates, as well as to verify the holder of a digital certificate
and ensure that the holder of the certificate is who they claim to be.
12. Answer: B. Revoking a certificate invalidates a certificate before its expiration date.
Revocation typically occurs because the certificate is no longer considered trustwor-
thy. For example, if a certificate holder’s private key is compromised, the certificate is
most likely to be revoked. Answer A is incorrect because recovery is necessary if a
certifying key is compromised but the certificate holder is still considered valid and
trusted. In this case, it is not true. Answer C is incorrect because changing the trust
model would necessitate unneeded changes. Answer D is incorrect. Key escrow

occurs when a certificate authority (CA) or other entity maintains a copy of the private
key associated with the public key signed by the CA.
13. Answer: D. A certificate policy indicates specific uses applied to a digital certificate, 
as well as other technical details. Thus, the certificate policy provides the rules that
indicate the purpose and use of an assigned digital certificate. Answer A is incorrect
because a registration authority (RA) provides authentication to the certificate authori-
ty (CA) as to the validity of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as
an aggregator of information. Answer B is incorrect; key escrow occurs when a CA or
other entity maintains a copy of the private key associated with the public key signed
by the CA. Answer C is incorrect because a trust model is an architecture within a
public key infrastructure (PKI) for certificate authorities.
14. Answer: B. Key escrow occurs when a CA or other entity maintains a copy of the 
private key associated with the public key signed by the CA. Answer A is incorrect
because a registration authority (RA) provides authentication to the CA as to the validi-
ty of a client’s certificate request; in addition, the RA serves as an aggregator of infor-
mation. Answer C is incorrect because a trust model is an architecture within a PKI for
certificate authorities. Answer D is incorrect; a certificate policy indicates specific uses
applied to a digital certificate, as well as other technical details. Thus, the certificate
policy provides the rules that indicate the purpose and use of an assigned digital cer-
tificate.
15. Answer: C. The focus of a certificate policy is on the certificate, whereas the focus of a
certificate practice statement is on the certificate authority (CA) and the way that the
CA issues certificates. Answer A is incorrect because the focus in the given statement
is reversed. Answers B and D are incorrect; neither a certificate policy nor a CPS
focuses solely on the keys.
16. Answer: B. A component of public key infrastructure (PKI) includes a mechanism for
distributing certificate revocation information, called certificate revocation lists (CRLs).
A CRL is used when verification of digital certificate takes place to ensure the validity
of a digital certificate. Answer A is incorrect because a certificate practice statement
(CPS) is a legal document created and published by a CA for the purpose of conveying
information to those depending on the CA’s issued certificates. Answer C is incorrect
because an Access Control List is used to control object permissions. Answer D is
incorrect because a public key infrastructure is a vast collection of varying technolo-
gies and policies for the creation and use of digital certificates.
17. Answer: A. An alternative to the hierarchical model is the cross-certification model,
often referred to as a Web of Trust. In this model, certificate authorities (CAs) are 
considered peers to one another. Answer B is incorrect in a hierarchical CA model, an
initial root CA exists at the top of the hierarchy with subordinate CAs below. Answer C
is incorrect; a solution to the complexity of a large cross-certification model is to
implement what is known as a bridge CA model. By implementing bridging, you can
have a single CA, known as the bridge CA, be the central point of trust. Answer D is
incorrect; a virtual bridge certificate authority model is used to overcome the bridge
certificate authority compromise problem and removes the cross certificates among
trust domains.

18. Answer: D. Key recovery is the process of restoring a key pair from a backup and re-
creating a digital certificate using the recovered keys. Answer A is incorrect; after the
key pairs are generated and a digital certificate has been issued by the CA, both keys
must be stored appropriately to ensure their integrity is maintained. However, the key
use must still be easy and efficient. Answer B is incorrect; when a certificate is no
longer valid, certificate revocation occurs. Answer C is incorrect. Key escrow occurs
when a certificate authority (CA) or other entity maintains a copy of the private key
associated with the public key signed by the CA.
19. Answer: A. In the single certificate authority (CA) architecture, only one CA exists 
to issue and maintain certificates. Although this model may be beneficial to smaller
organizations because of its administrative simplicity, it has the potential to present
problems. If the private key of the CA becomes compromised, all the issued certifi-
cates from that CA would then be invalid; therefore, answer B is incorrect. Answers C
and D are incorrect; a single CA architecture is based on simplicity.
20. Answer: D. A root certificate authority (CA) differs from subordinate CAs in that the
root CA is taken offline to reduce the risk of key compromise, and the root CA should
be made available only to create and revoke certificates for subordinate CAs.
Remember, if the root CA is compromised, the entire architecture is compromised. 
If a subordinate CA is compromised, however, the root CA can revoke the subordinate 
CA. Based on this information, answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect; a second-
ary CA is treated the same as a subordinate CA. Answer C is incorrect because a
bridge CA is a solution to the complexity of a large cross-certification model.
Objective 6.4: Implement PKI, certificate
management, and associated components.
1. Answer: B, D. The certificate life cycle is typically based on two documents: the 
certificate policy and the certification practice statement (CPS). Answer A is incorrect
because certificate revocation statement is an incorrect term. The correct term is a
certificate revocation list (CRL). A CRL is used when verification of digital certificate
takes place to ensure the validity of a digital certificate. Answer C is incorrect because
key escrow allows the certificate authority (CA) or escrow agent to have access to all
the information that is encrypted using the public key from a user’s certificate, as well
as create digital signatures on behalf of the user.
2. Answer: A, B. Although the benefit of central control may be seen as an advantage, a
centralized system also has other disadvantages, which include additional required
infrastructure, a need to positively authenticate the end entity prior to transmitting the
private key, as well as the need for a secure channel to transmit the private key.
Answer C is incorrect; additional overhead is reduced with a centralized system.
Answer D is incorrect; the public key does not need a secure channel.
3. Answer: C. Key escrow allows the certificate authority (CA) or escrow agent to have
access to all the information that is encrypted using the public key from a user’s cer-
tificate, as well as create digital signatures on behalf of the user. Answer A is incorrect;
after the key pairs are generated and a digital certificate has been issued by the CA,

both keys must be stored appropriately to ensure their integrity is maintained.
However, the key use must still be easy and efficient. Answer B is incorrect because
when a certificate is no longer valid, certificate revocation occurs. Answer D is incor-
rect; key recovery is the process of restoring a key pair from a backup and re-creating
a digital certificate using the recovered keys.
4. Answer: B, C. Both Online Certificate Status Protocol (OSCP) and certificate revoca-
tion lists (CRLs) are used to verify the status of a certificate. Answer A is incorrect.
The certificate policy provides the rules that indicate the purpose and use of an
assigned digital certificate. Answer D is incorrect because a certificate practice 
statement (CPS) is a legal document created and published by a certificate authority
(CA) for the purpose of conveying information to those depending on the CA’s issued
certificates.
5. Answer: B. Certificate suspension occurs when a certificate is under investigation to
determine if it should be revoked. This mechanism allows a certificate to stay in place,
but it is not valid for any type of use during the suspension. Answer A is incorrect;
revoking a certificate invalidates a certificate before its expiration date. Revocation 
typically occurs because the certificate is no longer considered trustworthy. Answer C
is incorrect; key recovery is the process of restoring a key pair from a backup and 
re-creating a digital certificate using the recovered keys. Answer D is incorrect; key
escrow occurs when a certificate authority (CA) or other entity maintains a copy of the
private key associated with the public key signed by the CA.
6. Answer: C. Key recovery is the process of restoring a key pair from a backup and 
re-creating a digital certificate using the recovered keys. Answer A is incorrect; revok-
ing a certificate invalidates a certificate before its expiration date. Revocation typically
occurs because the certificate is no longer considered trustworthy. Answer B is incor-
rect; certificate suspension occurs when a certificate is under investigation to deter-
mine if it should be revoked. This mechanism allows a certificate to stay in place, but
it is not valid for any type of use during the suspension. Answer D is incorrect; key
escrow occurs when a certificate authority (CA) or other entity maintains a copy of the
private key associated with the public key signed by the CA.
7. Answer: D. In a decentralized key system, the end user generates his or her own key
pair. The other functions, such as creation of the certificate, the revocation of the cer-
tificate, and key recovery and archiving are still handled by the certificate authority;
therefore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
8. Answer: C. A solution to the complexity of a large cross-certification model is to
implement what is known as a bridge certificate authority (CA) model. Remember that
in the cross-certification model, each CA must trust the others; however, by imple-
menting bridging, it is possible to have a single CA, known as the bridge CA, be the
central point of trust. Answers A and D are incorrect because these are CA server
types, not models. Answer B is incorrect; in the hierarchical CA model, an initial root
CA exists at the top of the hierarchy, and subordinate CAs reside beneath the root.
9. Answer: B. In some circumstances, dual or multiple key pairs might be used to sup-
port distinct and separate services. For example, a reorder associate may have one key
pair to be used for signing and sending encrypted messages and might have another
restricted to ordering equipment worth no more than a specific dollar amount. Multiple

key pairs require multiple certificates because the X.509 certificate format does not
support multiple keys; therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
10. Answer: B. The key usage extension of the certificate specifies how the private key can
be used. It is used to either to enable the exchange of sensitive information or to cre-
ate digital signatures. Answer A is incorrect because it describes the signature algo-
rithm identifier. Answer C is incorrect because it describes the validity period. Answer
D is incorrect because the public key is not of consequence to the extension usage.
11. Answer: A, C. If the key pair to be destroyed is used for digital signatures, the private
key portion should be destroyed first, to prevent future signing activities with the key.
In addition, a digital certificate associated with keys that are no longer valid should be
added to the CRL regardless of whether the key is actually destroyed or archived.
Answer B is incorrect because is concern is the private key. Answer D is incorrect
because a certificate practice statement (CPS) is a legal document created and pub-
lished by a CA for the purpose of conveying information to those depending on the
CA’s issued certificates.
12. Answer: B, C. The key usage extension of the certificate specifies how the private key
can be used. It is used either to enable the exchange of sensitive information or to cre-
ate digital signatures. Answer A is incorrect because peer negotiation is associated
with SSL/TLS. Answer D is incorrect because securing connections is associated with
PPTP.
13. Answer: B. In asymmetric encryption, the private key decrypts data encrypted with the
public key. Answer A is incorrect because the public key cannot decrypt the same data
it encrypted. Answer C is incorrect because the public key would be used to encrypt
and the private key to decrypt. Answer D is incorrect because this describes symmet-
ric encryption.
14. Answer: C. Every certificate is issued with an expiration date. When the certificate
expires, a new certificate needs to be reissued. So long as the certificate holder’s
needs or identity information has not changed, the process is relatively simple. After
the issuing certificate authority (CA) validates the entity’s identity, a new certificate can
be generated based on the current public key; therefore, answers A, B, and D are
incorrect.
15. Answer: A, C, D. The certificate life cycle refers to those events required to create,
use, and destroy public keys and the digital certificates with which they are associated.
The certificate life cycle is typically based on two documents: the certificate policy and
the certification practice statement (CPS). Answer B is incorrect; preservation is not
included in the certificate life cycle.
16. Answer: B, D. Revoking a certificate is not enough. The community that trusts these
certificates must be notified that the certificates are no longer valid. This is accom-
plished via a certificate revocation list (CRL) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP). Answer A is incorrect; it should read certificate policy. The certificate policy
provides the rules that indicate the purpose and use of an assigned digital certificate.
Answer C is incorrect because a certificate practice statement (CPS) is a legal docu-
ment created and published by a CA for the purpose of conveying information to those
depending on the CA’s issued certificates.

17. Answer: A. Certificate suspension occurs when a certificate is under investigation to
determine whether it should be revoked. Like the status checking that occurs with
revoked certificates, users and systems are notified of suspended certificates in the
same way. The primary difference is that new credentials will not need to be retrieved;
it is only necessary to be notified that current credentials have had a change in status
and are temporarily not valid for use. Answer B is incorrect because the proper usage
is reversed. Answers C and D are incorrect because both revocation and suspension
have to do with credentials, not key pair restoration.
18. Answer: B. M of N control as it relates to public key infrastructure (PKI) refers to 
the concept of backing up the public and private key across multiple systems. This
multiple backup provides a protective measure to ensure that no one individual can 
re-create his or her key pair from the backup. Answer A is incorrect; key escrow
occurs when a certificate authority (CA) or other entity maintains a copy of the private
key associated with the public key signed by the CA. Answer C is incorrect; key recov-
ery is the process of restoring a key pair from a backup and re-creating a digital cer-
tificate using the recovered keys. Answer D is incorrect; version control is associated
software development.
19. Answer: B, C, D. Three basic status levels exist in most public key infrastructure (PKI)
solutions: valid, suspended, and revoked. Answer A is incorrect; active status is a
generic term that is not specifically associated with status levels in a PKI.
20. Answer: A. Key escrow enables an organization to overcome the large problem of for-
gotten passwords. Rather than revoke and reissue new keys, an organization can gen-
erate a new certificate using the private key stored in escrow. Answers B, C, and D are
incorrect; forged signatures, phishing, and virus infections have nothing to do with key
escrow.
